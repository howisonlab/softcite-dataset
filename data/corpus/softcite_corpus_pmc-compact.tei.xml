            <p>Two experienced radiologists (JCS and IK-S) evaluated the image quality, based on the exposure of non-thoracic structures. They determined the most superior and inferior parts of the body, as well as the lateral structures, which had been included within the boundaries of collimation on each chest X-ray. The readers performed their evaluations according to the European Guidelines on Quality Criteria for Diagnostic Radiographic Images in Paediatrics <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. A grading system was used to measure image quality in terms of correct collimation. Inappropriate exposure of abdominal viscera was assumed when the caudal imaging field extended below the level of L1/2 (1 point). Exposure of the cranial structures was considered inappropriate when the collimated field included more than the tip of the mandible (1 point). Inappropriate exposure of the arms was assumed when more than the diametaphyseal junction of the proximal humerus came within the field of view: part of the diaphyseal humerus (1 point); entire humerus (2 points); part of the forearm (1 point); entire forearm (2 points); hand (1 point). The maximum score was 12 points. The image quality in terms of correct collimation was graded arbitrarily as follows: 0 points = optimal image quality; 1-2 points = slightly reduced; 3-4 = moderately reduced; 5-6 = markedly reduced; and &gt;7 points = severely reduced <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Rotation and tilting were also recorded. Radiographic errors were recorded on individual tick sheets and the information was captured in an <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="a7f72b2925-software-0">Excel</rs> spreadsheet (<rs corresp="#a7f72b2925-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs>, Redmond, WA).

Student's t test was used to calculate differences between DAPs. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to analyse the correlation between the radiographer's experience in performing X-rays and collimation quality. A level of p &lt; 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

            <p>Our results with rbf / cells indicate that some level of E2F activator, not simply E2F derepression, is required to bypass cell cycle exit upon terminal differentiation. This requirement is specific to the forced proliferation of terminally differentiating cells, as cells lacking all E2F-DP activity can proliferate during normal development <ref type="bibr">(Frolov et al., 2001, 2003, 2005)</ref>. This suggests that certain critical E2F targets may require the activator function of E2F for expression in differentiating cells. Therefore, we chose to compare gene expression changes caused by high E2F activity to those caused by the loss of all E2F-DP function in terminally differentiating cells.. E2F transcriptional activation and Dp loss are highly similar, except for specific genes that require E2F activity for expression after exit. Using microarrays, we compared gene expression in E2F1-DP-expressing wings (ap-Gal4/UAS-E2F1, UAS-DP, tub-Gal80 TS ) with controls (ap-Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS ) and Dp mutant wings (w;Dp a1/a2 ) with controls (w) at three time points. (A) Heat map of transcript changes (color range indicates the log 2 ratio of expression compared with controls). All transcripts with a fold change of 1.5 or more (&gt;log 2 ± 0.6) at one or more time points are shown. Gray bars indicate transcripts that were removed from analysis because of high variability among independently replicated experiments (n = 4 for E2F; n = 3 for Dp / ). Transcripts were clustered using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c212845b5e-software-simple-0">Genesis</rs> software for hierarchical clustering. Representative genes from each major cluster are listed on the right. Typical group transcripts are up-regulated in E2F-expressing and Dp / wings at 24 and 36 h APF, whereas other transcripts are repressed or inversely regulated. Arrays for E2F and Dp / at 24 and 36 h were highly similar with a correlation coefficient of 0.74. (B) A group of 162 genes was up-regulated &gt;1.75-fold (&gt;log 2 0.82) by E2F activity at one or both time points APF but was not significantly increased in Dp</p>
            <p>We hypothesized that high APC/C activity after exit could limit E2F-induced bypass of cell cycle exit by degrading key E2F targets. This is consistent with our finding that E2F1-DPoverexpressing cells do not accumulate the known APC/C targets CycA, Geminin (Gem; <ref type="bibr">Zielke et al., 2008)</ref>, CycB, or Stg (based on a Stg-GFP fusion protein) after prolonged exit in wings or eyes (40-44 h APF; <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, A, C, E, and G; and <ref type="figure">Fig. S3)</ref>, despite expressing high levels of cycA, gem, stg, and cycB transcripts by microarray (see supplemental dataset and <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="c212845b5e-software-simple-1">JCB DataViewer</rs>). In contrast, cells expressing E2F + Rca1 together accumulated CycA in wings <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 B)</ref>, Stg-GFP in eyes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 D)</ref>, Gem in eyes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 H)</ref>, and very low levels of CycB in wings and eyes <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 F and Fig. S3)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Pupae, staged from white prepupae (0 h) at 25°C, were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Pupal cuticle was removed from wings after fixation. Tissues 24-36 h APF were blocked in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 + 1% BSA for 1 h. Tissues 36-44 h APF were blocked in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 + 1% BSA (PAT) overnight. For stages after 44 h APF, we incorporated a methanol dehydration series after fixation (25, 50, 75, and 100% methanol/1× PBS, 10 min each) that allowed improved antibody penetration, increased sensitivity, and BrdU detection for tissues 44-60 h APF. After step-wise rehydration, tissues were blocked in PAT overnight, and antibody staining or BrdU incorporation was performed as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Buttitta et al., 2007; Zielke et al., 2008)</ref> using Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 568-or Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated secondary antibodies and Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Wing hinge and notum as well as head capsule and antenna were excluded from our analyses. 1 µg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen) was used to label nuclei. Confocal sections and differential interference contrast images were collected on a microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 25× objective. Single representative sections (2.2 µm) are shown, except for <ref type="figure">Fig. 3 (E and F)</ref>, which are projections of eight sections at a 1-µm interval. Images were cropped using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="c212845b5e-software-9">Photoshop</rs> (<rs corresp="#c212845b5e-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Adobe</rs>).

            <p>Online supplemental material <ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref> shows that bypass of cell cycle exit is limited, even in the absence of all E2F-DP function. <ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref> shows GFP-labeled clones expressing the indicated cell cycle regulators generated using hs-FLP tub&gt;Gal4/ UAS, tub-Gal80 TS . <ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref> shows GFP-marked clones expressing the indicated cell cycle regulators generated using hs-FLP tub&gt;Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS and examined for CycB or Gem.

Tumor burden was expressed as the proportion of tumor occupying the total area. Tissue fixation and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were carried out as previously described. <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> The proliferative index in the bone metastatic lesions was assessed by staining with a Ki67 antibody (1 μg/ml; Abcam, Toronto, ON, Canada). Anti-Cleaved-Caspase 3 staining (0.2 μg/ml dilution; Cell Signaling, Whitby, ON, Canada) was performed to quantify apoptosis within the bone lesions. Following incubation with the primary antibody, secondary biotin-conjugated antibody (Jackson Laboratories) was applied for 30 min. After washing with distilled water, slides were developed with diaminobenzidine (Dako) as the chromogen. All slides were counterstained using Harris haematoxylin before being scanned using a Scanscope XT digital slide scanner (Aperio). Quantification was performed by analyzing bone metastases with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="a32ca4af9a-software-2">Imagescope</rs> software (<rs corresp="#a32ca4af9a-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Aperio</rs>) using positive pixel count algorithm for Ki67 and Cleaved Caspase-3 staining.

Repeated measures two-way ANOVA with interactions was used to calculate the difference in bioluminescence data between the two groups. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

Continuous variables were expressed as meanAESD and analyzed by unpaired t tests, with Welch adjustment when necessary. Continuous variables that violated the normality assumption were expressed as median and 25th to 75th percentiles and analyzed by a Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were expressed as absolute (n) and relative (%) frequency and were analyzed by the Pearson 2-test or the Fisher exact test whenever appropriate. Significant level was considered with P&lt;0.05. Univariate analysis was carried out for patient data, and multivariate analysis by logistic regression was used to obtain data about the risk factors for AKI at the 3 time points: preoperative, ICU admittance, and 24 hours after ICU admittance. In the multivariate analysis, results were expressed by the odds ratio and the 95% confidence interval. The regression b of those variables obtained from logistic regression were used to develop the final 3 stage scores to predict CSA-AKI. The 1152 patients in the validation cohort were scored for validation, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) as well as Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were applied to estimate the reliability of the scoring for predicting CSA-AKI.</p>

            <p>Thirty-four items were included in the draft instrument: 27 from the qualitative analysis and seven from previous surveys. Items relating to similar concepts were included to explore alternative wording; redundancy was checked during data analysis. A full explanation of item derivation is provided in online supplementary appendix 1. All items were written in the second person to personalise the survey and to clarify that respondents were being asked about their personal beliefs regarding their own back.

            <p>Multiphoton intravital imaging of the BM. We prepared the mouse calvarian BM as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Junt et al., 2007)</ref>. We used a BioTech TriMScope system (LaVision BioTec) and Ti: Sa laser (MaiTai) to capture images through a 20× water immersion objective lens (NA = 0.95; Olympus). Images were acquired with ImSpectorPro (LaVision BioTec). For three-dimensional (3D) acquisition, the stacks were acquired at a 920-nm wavelength at vertical spacing of 2-3 µm to cover an axial depth of 30-100 µm (for YFP or EGFP). Subsequently, the same stacks were acquired at a wavelength of 800 nm (for TRITC-dextran). The distances between MKs and vasculatures were measured in the reconstructed 3D structure using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ea10e3db27-software-3">Volocity</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ea10e3db27-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">PerkinElmer</rs>). If MKs were outside the vessels, the closest distance from MKs to vessels was measured and represented as negative values. If MKs were in direct physical contact with the vessels, the distance was regarded as (R&amp;D Systems). To block S1pr1 in vivo, we treated C57BL6/J or CD1 mice with W146 (3 mg/kg body weight i.p.) or vehicle every 6 h and measured platelet counts in these mice 24 h later.</p>
            <p>Immunostaining. Anti-mouse S1pr1 (Zytomed), anti-human S1PR1 (ABR), anti-S1pr2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-S1pr4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), antitubulin (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-mouse CD41 (BD), and anti-CD42c (Emfret Analytics) antibodies were used for immunostaining. The samples were examined using Leica microscopy equipped with 40× objective lens (NA = 0.7) or 20× objective lens (NA = 0.5) and commercial charge-coupled device camera (AxioCam; Carl Zeiss). Images were acquired by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ea10e3db27-software-0">AxioVision</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ea10e3db27-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Carl Zeiss</rs>). For quantification of MK number and size in BM, we counted the total number of MKs in five randomly selected 20× microscopic fields, and the area of MK cell body was analyzed by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ea10e3db27-software-1">ImageJ</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ea10e3db27-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>). S1P level measurement. Levels of S1P were determined by highperformance liquid chromatography with mass detection as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Berdyshev et al., 2005)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Quantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the MaximaTM SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The data were normalized to the mRNA level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh or GAPDH). Primers are listed in <ref type="table">Table S1.</ref> MK culture. Mouse embryonic day (E) 12.5-14.5 FL cells were cultivated in TPO-containing medium for differentiation into MKs <ref type="bibr">(Lecine et al., 1998)</ref>. In brief, mouse FLs were isolated from E12.5-14.5 embryos and kept in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoal-treated FBS (PAN) in the presence of hTPO (ImmunoTools) in a humidified 5% CO 2 /95% air incubator at 37°C. For isolation of immature MKs, E12.5-14.5 FL cells were cultured in medium for 12 h and then incubated with FITC-CD41 (BD) and PE-CD34 (BioLegend) antibodies. Immature MKs were identified as a CD41/CD34 double-positive population and enriched by using a FACSAria cell sorter (BD). Mature MKs were enriched by BSA gradient, as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Pang et al., 2006)</ref>. In brief, the BSA step gradient was prepared by placing PBS containing 1.5% BSA on top of PBS with 3% BSA (PAA). Cells were loaded on top of the gradient, and MKs were settled to the bottom within 30 min at 1× gravity at room temperature. Mature MKs formed a pellet at the bottom of the tube. We distinguished and scored PPs according to the criteria mentioned previously <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2007)</ref>. To inhibit the activity of Rac GTPases, we cultured MKs in the presence of 50 µM NSC23766 (Tocris Bioscience) for 3 d and then scored MKs carrying PPs. To establish a stable gradient during the slow process of PPF, we applied chemotaxis -slides (ibidi), which consist of two large reservoirs with different chemoattractant concentrations and a thin (1 mm) slit between these two reservoirs. A linear and stable chemoattractant gradient is established in the slit by diffusion <ref type="bibr">(Zengel et al., 2011)</ref>. MKs were resuspended in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 1 µM VPC23019 (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) and loaded onto chemotaxis -slides coated with poly-l-lysine between two large reservoirs. 10 µM S1P or vehicle was applied into one of the reservoirs of the -slides. MKs were cultivated for 10 h at 37°C, and polarization of PPF was evaluated based on the images captured using an Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with 20× objective lens (Nikon) and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ea10e3db27-software-simple-6">AxioVision</rs> software.</p>

Depending on the goals of the course and the experience of the instructor, the filtering and taxonomic assignments can be done with the students. Alternatively, these steps can be performed by the instructor outside of the class and the taxonomic classification and relative abundance data can be used in class. Many of the academic and commercial sequencing facilities will perform filtering and basic analysis of the raw sequence data. Classes that do not have a wet lab component can analyze data collected by students in other courses or data collected by other investigators.</p>

            <p>HeLa cells transfected with siRNA against C7orf30 were seeded at 3 Â 10 4 cells/well in 200 ml growth medium in XF 24-well cell culture microplates (Seahorse Bioscience) and incubated at 37 C in 5% CO 2 for 36-40 h. One hour before the assay growth medium was removed and replaced with assay medium (low buffered DMEM, 10 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glucose), with one wash of assay medium, and left to stabilize in a 37 C non-CO 2 incubator. Analysis was performed in quadruplicate using a XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). The wells were sequentially injected with 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) to inhibit glycolysis, 100 nM oligomycin to inhibit ATP-synthase, 500-1000 nM carbonylcyanide-4-trifluorometho-xyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) to uncouple the respiratory chain, and 200 nM rotenone to inhibit complex I. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured for each well every 5 min. before and after each injection. Test compounds: 2-DG, oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone were all obtained from Sigma. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> S-methionine metabolic labelling of mitochondrial proteins HeLa cells transfected with siRNA against C7orf30 or stably transfected HEK293T cells expressing C7orf30.

Growth medium was replaced with methionine/cysteinefree DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 48 mg/ml cysteine and 50 mg/ml uridine. The cells were incubated for 2 Â 10 min in this medium, then transferred to methionine/cysteine-free DMEM medium containing 10% (v/v) dialysed FCS and emetine dihydrochloride (100 mg/ml). Cells were incubated for 10 min before addition of 120 mCi/ml of [ 35 S]-methionine. Labelling was performed for 15 min and the cells were washed twice with standard growth medium.

            <p>In order to establish whether OXPHOS defects observed upon inactivation of C7orf30 <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref> were a result of impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, we inhibited cytosolic translation and labelled de novo synthesized mitochondrially encoded subunits of the electron transport chain with <ref type="bibr">35</ref> S-Met. The incorporation of radioactive <ref type="bibr">35</ref> S-Met into mitochondrial proteins was analysed 6 days after the HeLa cells were transfected with C7orf30 siRNA. Translation of all mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain subunits was compromised upon C7orf30 gene silencing, with incorporation of <ref type="bibr">35</ref> S-Met reduced by &lt;60% (for the more potent C7orf30 siRNA oligo 1) as compared to controls transfected with an unrelated siRNA <ref type="figure">(Figure 5A)</ref>. In order to investigate whether inactivation of C7orf30 has an effect on the integrity of the mitochondrial ribosome, we carried out gradient sedimentation analyses of lysates from HeLa cells transfected with C7orf30 siRNA for 6 days and control cells transfected with an unrelated siRNAwere quantified for C7orf30-depleted cells using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="a8bba27005-software-simple-2">ImageQuant</rs> software.

(C) OCR in C7orf30-depleted cells. OCR measured in an extracellular flux Seahorse instrument in control cells transfected with an unrelated siRNA or cells treated with siRNA to C7orf30 for 6 days. The wells containing cells were sequentially injected with 20 mM 2-DG to inhibit glycolysis, 100 nM oligomycin to inhibit ATP-synthase, 1 mM FCCP to uncouple the respiratory chain and 200 nM rotenone to inhibit complex I. n = 6, error bars = 1 SD. (D) Steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts upon inactivation of C7orf30. Total RNA from control cells (Ctrl) and cells transfected with two siRNAs specific for C7orf30 were analysed by northern blots using radioactive probes specific for the indicated mitochondrial transcripts. Nuclear-encoded 28S rRNA was used as a loading control. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>G), consistent with a decrease in monosome formation, presumably due to alterations in mt-LSU integrity. These results, together with the observation that the steady-state levels of mitochondrial rRNAs were not changed <ref type="figure">(Figure 4D)</ref>, suggest that the inhibition of mitochondrial translation upon inactivation of C7orf30 could be attributed mainly to instability and/or impaired assembly of the large mitoribosomal subunit, consequently interfering with formation of the mitochondrial monosome.</p>

            <p>Transthoracic 2D, M-mode, and Doppler imaging were performed in 8 animals per group using a Vivid 7 Ultrasound (GE Healthcare, Aurora, OH) echograph with linear and sectorial probes operated at 14 and 10 MHz, respectively, and data were analyzed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a78e8e24e9-software-simple-0">Echopac</rs> PC software. Animals were examined 28 days post-bleomycin instillation under isofluran-induced narcosis (2.5%, inhalation). Measurements, performed by 2 sonographers blinded to the treatment groups, were made in accordance with the conventions of the American Society of Echocardiography. M-mode measurements of RV free wall thickness and end-diastolic cavity dimension (left ventricle: LV and RV areas) were measured in the parasternal short axis view, just below the level of the aortic valve, and their ratio was calculated. Pulsed wave Doppler of pulmonary outflow was recorded in the parasternal short axis view at the level of the aortic valve. The sample volume was placed proximal to the pulmonary valve leaflets and aligned to maximize laminar flow. In addition, the PA acceleration time, velocity time integral, and ejection time (ET) were measured. By combining PA velocity time integral, PA area, and heart rate, echographic cardiac output was determined. The tricuspid valve was also evaluated for the presence of tricuspid regurgitation with color and continuouswave Doppler in the apical 4-chamber view; no alteration was detected. At the time of killing, that is, after echocardiography, a rapid excision of the lungs and heart was performed through a ventral thoracotomy, and each organ was weighed. After removal of the atria to the plane of the atrial-ventricular valves, the RV free wall was dissected from the LV and septum. The RV and LV + septum were weighed, and the RV-to-LV + septum ratio (Fulton index) was calculated. Tibia lengths were measured to normalize read outs because animals presented body weight differences between the groups at the end of study. Eight RVs from each group were then processed for quantitative polymerase chain reaction, whereas the remaining samples were used for histological analysis.</p>
            <p>Pulmonary arterial wall thickness measurement was adapted from Mouchaers et al <ref type="bibr">16</ref> to assess pulmonary vascular hypertrophy. Lungs (left lobe) and hearts (RV) were cut sagittally, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (4% formaldehyde), embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 mm, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin, sirius red, and Orcein (lungs only).

For each group, 24 transversely cut muscular pulmonary arterioles, ranging from 15 to 100 mm in diameter, were randomly selected, depicted at high-power field (objective ·40), and measured in a blinded fashion. The internal lamina elastic was considered as inner perimeter; therefore, the real caliber was extrapolated independently from the contraction status of the arteries, and then the relative pulmonary arterial wall thickness (RPAWT) was calculated as follows:</p>

            <p>We employed the Dreiding 53 force field with ab initio point charges fit to the electrostatic potential, and optimized the unit cell using a combination of steepest descent, Newton-Raphson and quasi-Newton methods <ref type="bibr">19</ref>. The long-range periodic electrostatic interactions were evaluated by Ewald sums. The results presented here are based on a lattice energy minimization of motionless molecules (that is, finite temperature effects are totally neglected). To validate this approach, we attempted to reproduce the experimental crystal structure of 1. For 1, the initial guess for the optimization was the experimentally determined unit cell. The effect of charges calculated by PBE/DNP <ref type="bibr">34</ref> and B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) levels of theory on the unit cell parameters of 1 are shown in Supplementary Table S1, indicated by (DNP) and (G), respectively. Both yield comparable structure parameters to the experimentally determined unit cell, although B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) charges have slightly better agreement with the experimental unit cell parameters and density. Consequently, the latter was used for the computations on 2 and 7.

            <p>The reported estimate and adjusted OR for closure time were calculated for an increase in platelet closure time of 10 s (rather than 1 s), a choice based on the premise that a 1 s increase would be of limited clinical usefulness. The final model was evaluated by c-statistic (area under the ROC curve) and the Hosmer and Lemeshow fit test. As a sensitivity test, the results were calculated using the general estimating equation (PROC GENMOD) with study site evaluated as a subject factor (cluster) rather than a term in the model. The Net Reclassification Index (NRI) and Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) statistic were not included in the analyses, given the scepticism and criticisms that have been raised concerning their value in predicting the potential, incremental prognostic impact of novel biomarkers. <ref type="bibr">27 28</ref> Analyses were performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="afe5da2424-software-0">GraphPad Prism</rs> V.<rs corresp="#afe5da2424-software-0" resp="#annotator0" type="version">5.04</rs> (San Diego, California, USA) and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="afe5da2424-software-1">SAS</rs> V.<rs corresp="#afe5da2424-software-1" resp="#annotator0" type="version">9.3</rs> (Carey, North Carolina, USA).</p>

            <p>Immunofluorescent labeling was conducted on frozen cortical brain sections of Htau (Jackson Laboratory, stock #004808, n = 3), and wildtype (WT) (Taconic, BALB/c, n = 2) mice as well as brain samples from FTLD (n = 4), AD (n = 4), and age-matched controls (n = 4) (Oregon Brain Bank). P301L (Taconic, stock #2508, n = 3) mouse eye sections were also used. Immunofluorescence was conducted as previously published <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>. Briefly, the sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and the human sections were treated with an autofluorescence eliminator as per manufacturer instructions (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Mouse and human sections were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and were then incubated with tau oligomerspecific polycolonal antibody T22 (mouse-1:250, human-1:200, <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>) in 4 • C overnight. The following day, the sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa-488 or Alexa-568 (1:500, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) for 1 h. Sections were then incubated overnight with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (mouse and human-1:150, BioLegend, San Diego, CA), Iba1 (mouse and human-1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or high motility group box 1 (HMGB1) (Mouse-1:50, Abcam, human-1:500, Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 • C. The sections were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa-568 (1:500, Invitrogen) or goat anti-rabbit 568 for 1 h. The sections were stained with 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen) and mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). The retinal slides were imaged with a confocal LSM510 Zeiss laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA) as a single digital image. The brain sections were imaged on a Nikon A1R MP laser scanning microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) at 60X magnification under oil submersion. The objective numerical aperture was 1.4. Using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a3970a91b9-software-simple-0">ImageJ</rs>, the corrected cell fluorescence method was used to quantify the images as previously described <ref type="bibr">[35, 36]</ref>. Briefly, there were four separate images from each section analyzed using this method where five cells were measured as well as five background regions. In order to account for cell size and background, the background was multiplied by the area of the cell and subtracted from the total fluorescence. One-way ANOVA, student's t-tests, or Pearson's correlation were used to analyze the corrected cell fluorescence on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a3970a91b9-software-0">Graphpad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#a3970a91b9-software-0" resp="#annotator10" type="version">6</rs> (<rs corresp="#a3970a91b9-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Graphpad Software</rs>, La Jolla, CA). In addition, Pearson's correlation coefficient was measured to quantify the strength of co-localization between T22 and GFAP using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a3970a91b9-software-simple-4">ImageJ</rs> software.</p>
            <p>An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to detect the astrocyte marker, GFAP, and total tau. All measurements were performed in triplicate. Plates were coated with 30 g/well using 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, as coating buffer, followed by overnight incubation at 4 • C. Agematched control (n = 4), FTLD (n = 4), and AD (n = 4) brains obtained from the Oregon Brain bank, were used in the ELISA. Negative and positive controls were conducted. The positive control was Tg2576 insoluble brain homogenate with 0.05% Triton-X in PBS. Plates were washed 1 time with Tris-buffered saline with low Tween (0.01%) (TBST), then blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBST. The plates were then washed with TBST 1 time. Anti-GFAP (1:2000, Covance, Princeton, NJ) was diluted in 5% nonfat milk in TBST and added to one plate. Anti-Tau5 (1:1000, Millipore), diluted in 5% nonfat milk in TBST, was added to another plate and all were allowed to react for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed 3 times with TBST and 100 l of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:3000, BioRad, Hercules, CA) was added. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, plates were washed 3 times with TBST and developed with 3,3',5,5',-tetramethylbenzidine substrate from DAKO (Carpentaria, CA). The reaction was stopped with 100 l 1 M HCl, and samples were read at 450 nm using a POLARstar OMEGA plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Ortenberg, Germany). Oneway ANOVA with a multiple comparisons test was used to analyze results on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a3970a91b9-software-4">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#a3970a91b9-software-4" resp="#annotator10" type="version">6</rs> (<rs corresp="#a3970a91b9-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GraphPad Software</rs>).</p>
            <p>Images were quantified using corrected cell fluorescence, as described previously <ref type="bibr">[35, 36]</ref>. Four images per subject were obtained and five cells were outlined and measured in each image. To account for both background and the size of the cell, five background measurements were also taken and the background fluorescence was multiplied by the area. This was subtracted from the total intensity for the cell in order to obtain a corrected cell fluorescence. The corrected cell fluorescence for five cells per image were averaged and a One-Way ANOVA with a multiple comparisons test was conducted to compare control (n = 4, 20 cells quantified), FTLD (n = 4, 20 cells quantified), and AD (n = 4, 20 cells quantified). A student's unpaired t-test was used for the mouse quantifications with two groups while a One-Way ANOVA was used for the mouse samples with more than two groups. For the ELISA, One-Way ANOVA was used with multiple comparisons test. All statistics were performed on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a3970a91b9-software-3">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#a3970a91b9-software-3" resp="#annotator10" type="version">6</rs> (<rs corresp="#a3970a91b9-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GraphPad Software</rs>) and p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

            <p>Western blotting analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of DMOG on the expression of VEGF in NCL-H157 cells. The cells were cultured in regular medium with the addition of different concentrations of CIK (concentration of effector-to-target cell ratios (E/T ratio) ranged from 10:1, 20:1 and 30:1). The total protein was harvested from the cultured cells according to standard protocols. Then the protein concentration was measured with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE with 12% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies of β-actin (1:1000, Santa Cruz, USA), VEGF (1:500, Santa Cruz, USA). Then the membranes were incubated with gentle agitation for 2 hours at 37°C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in 5% skim milk powder at 1:7500. After washing three times in Tris-Buffered Saline-Tween-20 (Beyotime, China) (10 minutes each wash), the membranes were developed by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting detection system.

            <p>In the developing nervous system, Reelin is produced mainly by Cajal-Retzius neurons in the cortex, where it instructs newly born neurons to assume their position and orientation <ref type="bibr">(D'Arcangelo et al., 1995; Tissir and Goffinet, 2003)</ref>. During this process, the neurons are intimately apposed to radial glial cells that form a scaffold along which the neuroblasts migrate, and both cell types rely on Reelin signaling to direct correct patterning of the cortex <ref type="bibr">(Hartfuss et al., 2003; Tissir and Goffinet, 2003; Keilani and Sugaya, 2008; Zhao and Frotscher, 2010)</ref>. In the lymphatic system, we found that Reelin was produced exclusively by ECs, while its release and proteolytic processing was stimulated by the adjacent SMCs. This suggests a mechanism by which Reelin signaling is activated via communication of the two cell types that form the collecting vessels. We further found that LECs, in turn, respond to Reelin by upregulating the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), a factor known to promote SMC migration and proliferation <ref type="bibr">(Religa et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2008; Aplin et al., 2010)</ref>. This suggests an autocrine function of Reelin in the LECs in controlling the expression of factors involved in SMC recruitment. Interestingly, although the canonical Reelin receptors VLDLR and ApoER2 were expressed in the lymphatic vasculature, Apoer2;Vldlr double mutant mice did not recapitulate the phenotype observed in Reln-deficient lymphatic vessels.littermate controls (n = 3 per each genotype, two vessels per mouse). The images were aligned and processed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="b74d247782-software-5">Photoshop</rs> <rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-5" resp="#curator" type="version">CS4 or CS5</rs> (<rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-5" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Adobe</rs>).

An inclusive threshold was applied to the -SMA channel so that the background was captured by, while all SMC were excluded from, the threshold. The length of the vessel was measured and divided into quarters. A region was drawn around each vessel segment, excluding overlapping blood vessels. The SMC coverage was calculated and subtracted from 100%. A similar thresholding technique was used to quantify the percentage of LVYE-1 immunofluorescence. The line tool in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b74d247782-software-simple-5">MetaMorph</rs> was used to measure the width of the widest and narrowest vessel points.</p>
            <p>For qualitative analysis of lymphatic vessel function, FITC-dextran (8 mg/ml in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected intradermally into the ears of anaesthetized mice and analyzed by confocal microscopy. For quantitative analysis, 2 µl of ICG dye (1% in dH 2 O; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the footpads of anaesthetized mice inside the IVIS Spectrum Whole Body Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences). Image acquisition and analysis was performed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="b74d247782-software-7">Living Image</rs> <rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-7" resp="#annotator12" type="version">3</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-7" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Caliper Life Sciences</rs>) using the following parameters: field of view 6.6, binning 8, and F-stop 2. 70 images were taken with a 2-s exposure time and no delay between acquisitions, which resulted in an image every 3-4 s. The efficiency of the fluorescent signal was measured in a region of interest (ROI) created around a small area of the lymphatic vessel above the knee. The mean efficiency against time was plotted using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="b74d247782-software-8">Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-8" resp="#annotator12" type="version">5</rs> software, using 4 s as an interval. For the quantitative Evans blue assay, 2 µl Evan's blue dye (2%; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the hind limb footpad. After 5 min, the mice were sacrificed and inguinal lymph nodes were dissected. Both inguinal lymph nodes were weighed together and a mean value was used to calculate dye content in each of them separately. Each lymph node was placed in 5 µl formamide at 60°C for 24 h, followed by an absorbance reading at 620 nm. Evans blue concentration was calculated using a standard curve and presented as dye content per gram of tissue.</p>
            <p>To identify lymphatic-specific ECM molecules, mesenteric arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels were dissected from P7 wild-type (C57BL/6J) pups. Samples from nine animals (in two litters) were pooled. Total RNA was extracted and RNase-treated using an RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN) as per the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng of RNA from two independent samples of each vessel was amplified using WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System (NuGEN) and used for expression profiling using the Mouse exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The array data were processed using robust multiarray analysis <ref type="bibr">(Irizarry et al., 2003)</ref> to generate gene-level signal estimates for core level probe sets. The arrays were normalized using quantile normalization and antigenomic probes used to model the background. Quantification was run using apt-1.10.0 from Affymetrix. Before statistical analysis, all Affymetrix control probe sets were removed. Gene changes were selected using a linear model where the standard errors were corrected using empirical Bayes shrinkage (fdr &lt; 0.05). To identify lymphatic-specific transcriptional changes, we applied a nestedF procedure across the three contrasts, selecting genes significant in only the lymphatic groups (fdr &lt; 0.05).

The same analysis was performed for Apoer2 / ;Vldlr / , Dab1 Scm , and their respective Transwell migration assay Migration assay was performed using 6.5-mm Transwell with 8 µm polycarbonate membrane inserts (Corning) in a 24-well plate. The lower face of the membrane was coated with 1 µg/ml fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) before use. Confluent HUVSMC were serum-deprived in SMC growth medium containing 0.2% BSA for 22 h. 1 × 10 5 cells were seeded in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate toward EC growth medium (control) or conditioned medium collected from LECs over a 48-h period, full-length Reelin supernatant from HEK 293 cells (diluted 1:20), control supernatant (diluted 1:20), 10 ng/ml MCP-1 (R&amp;D Systems), or 3 ng/ml PDGF-BB (R&amp;D Systems) over a 23-h period. Reelin function was inhibited using blocking antibody against Reelin (CR-50, 50 µg/ml; MBL). Cells on the upper face of the membrane were removed and migrated cells on the lower face were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution in 25% methanol. Images of the filters were acquired with a stereomicroscope (MZ16 F) equipped with a camera (DFC420C) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b74d247782-software-9">Microsystems software</rs> (all from <rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Leica</rs>).

To calculate fold differences in cleavage intensities between mutant and wild-type RNA, sxy-1 or sxy-7 values were divided by wild-type values at each position. At positions where mutant RNAs were more weakly cut than wildtype, wild-type values were instead divided by mutant and then expressed as a negative value.</p>

Cronbach's coefficient alpha and item-total correlation coefficients were generated to examine the internal consistency of the SIB. Also, Spearman correlation coefficients were generated to evaluate the 3 months test-retest reliability.

            <p>Mice were killed by CO 2 asphyxiation; then tissue was quickly harvested and fixed overnight at room temperature with Z-fix solution (Anatech LTD, Battle Creek, MI). Tissues were processed by using a Leica (Buffalo Grove, IL) ASP300S Tissue Processor, paraffin embedded, and cut into 5-μm sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed on a Dako Autostainer Plus (Dako North America, Inc, Carpinteria, CA) or Discovery Ultra XT autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems Inc, Tucson, AZ) and counterstaining with hematoxylin. Dual immunohistochemistry for CK19 and amylase was performed without counterstaining. Picrosirius red staining was performed per the manufacturer's instructions (Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, PA). Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed by using Mayer's hematoxylin solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and Eosin Y (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described. <ref type="bibr">45</ref> Immunohistochemistry slides were scanned on a Pannoramic SCAN slide scanner (Perkin Elmer, WA), and then annotation regions encompassing greater than 1 mm of tissue were processed by using appropriate algorithms for each stain quantified by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="ae7c735e68-software-0">Halo</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ae7c735e68-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Indica Labs</rs>, Corrales, NM).

            <p>Almost half of the IGs and more than half of the genes significantly change their expression level in the Crp(À) mutant relative to the wild-type during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth To identify IGs and genes with significant changes in gene expression the statistical analysis of the data was implemented as a two class unpaired experiment, with one class referring to the Crp(À) mutant and the other to the wild-type strain of MR1. Biological replicates and time points were combined because of the high pair-wise correlation between them (87-99%) across genes and IGs within either the wild-type or Crp(À) mutant expression profiles (Supplementary Data 1). Stanford <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="ec62815cfc-software-simple-0">Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM)</rs> software (53) was used for the analysis with the recommended parameters and a threshold for false discovery rate of 0.06%. Results of the analysis (Supplementary Data 2) revealed that almost half of the IGs and more than half of the genes significantly changed, either decreased or increased, the level of their expression in the Crp(À) mutant relative to the wild-type. The percentage of IGs yielding significantly decreased expression was about the same (28%) as the percentage of genes that were repressed (31%). About 15% of IGs and 21% of genes had a significantly increased level of expression. Thus, a change in the growth condition in combination with the knockout of Crp, a regulator of the MR1 response to the change, induced significant transcriptional reprogramming of not only genes, but also of IGs in the MR1 genome.</p>

            <p>All nurses and doctors were invited to participate via information sessions followed by a direct approach. Rosters (schedules) from each ward were used to calculate the full-time equivalents for each nurse classification (RN new graduate, RN 2-4 years, RN 5+ years, and CNS) and medical classification (intern, resident, and registrar). The sampling strategy was prepared in order to ensure all hours of the work day and weekdays were sampled proportionately to ensure the sample was representative. Representative sampling was used to determine the number of minutes that participants needed to be observed for each hour of the day for each classification. Following signed consent, nurses and doctors were assigned a study identification number, and demographic information regarding their age, classification, and length of experience was collected. We did not store staff names once a unique identifier was assigned and did not match data for individual staff in the pre-and post-periods. Nurses were given no prior warning of observation periods.Observers randomly allocated nurses to a list for each observation session according to the sampling strategy. If a nurse at the top of the list was not working that day, observers selected the next nurse on the list. A similar approach was used for doctors, but on occasion pre-arranged times were requested as doctors were more mobile and locating them in the hospital could be difficult without this step. Nurses were observed between the hours of 7:00 and 19:00 and doctors from 8:00 to 20:00 on weekdays. Nurses and doctors were observed while both on and off the ward. The <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="e7da55478a-software-simple-0">Work Observation Method by Activity Timing (WOMBAT)</rs> method was applied. <ref type="bibr">30-33</ref> This is a technique for undertaking direct observational studies of health professionals. Using software on a handheld computer, observers capture multi-dimensional aspects of work and communication patterns. The <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="e7da55478a-software-simple-1">WOMBAT</rs> tool automatically captures all time data related to tasks and also details interruptions to work and multi-tasking (ie, tasks conducted in parallel). For example, details of tasks conducted in parallel, such as documenting and answering a question from a colleague, could be recorded and time-stamped automatically. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> provides a screenshot of the data collection tool. The tool can be reconfigured for different task types and study designs. Research teams interested in using this software should contact the corresponding author ( JIW).</p>
            <p>Information sources (eg, desk PC, COW) used in medication tasks were determined by calculating the proportions of total medication task time undertaken using each source. Time spent in interactions was examined in terms of both proportion of total observation time in professional communication, and the proportion of overall task time completed with others.

            <p>Behavioral economic principles have been used by other industries for decades. The most notable example is the 401(k) retirement plans from companies. Historically, companies offered employees the choice of enrolling in a 401(k) plan. By incorporating active choice, a strategy that requires individuals to select between options, companies experienced a 28% increase in 401(k) participation over the standard opt in procedure. Applying loss aversion through enhanced active choice (e.g. "I don't want to enroll in a 401(k) plan and don't want to take advantage of the employer match") has been shown to induce more compliance. <ref type="bibr">57,58</ref> The federal Administration of Children and Families (ACF) used a series of interventions to encourage Texas prison inmates to lower the amount of child support they owe while they are in prison. The primary driver is that state welfare agencies are at risk of losing federal funding for late and unpaid child support payments. The interventions included sending a teaser postcard before the official letter arrived, printing materials on blue paper to distinguish it from other mail,explaining other parents had successfully reduced their child support, and sending a reminder postcard for those that did not respond. While fewer than 50% of eligible inmates participated, a social science researcher at ACF explains this was a big impact at a low cost. <ref type="bibr">59</ref> More recently, researchers have partnered with employers, insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers to develop (or investigate) the use of behavioral economics in the health care industry. Interventions have ranged from simple nudges such as promoting seat belt use or encouraging more healthy eating choices by putting the salad bar at the front of a buffet to increasing organ donation and providing financial incentives and peer mentoring to improve medication adherence for patients with chronic conditions. While many interventions target the patient, some target physicians. For example, a radiologist spent more time with a patient's report and felt more connected to the patient when the patient's picture was attached to an X-ray. Patients were 24 times more likely to have a sigmoidoscopy and 9 times more likely to have a fecal occult blood test relative to a control group when physicians suggested screening for colon cancer. <ref type="bibr">48</ref> These types of nudges are geared toward individuals making one-time decisions (e.g. organ donation). If the goal is to improve medication adherence (a behavior that occurs frequently), then the intervention should occur just as frequently. Behavioral economists believe automated hovering is one way to do this. <ref type="bibr">55</ref> Automated hovering has been described as a cost-effective way to monitor and provide feedback to patients. Examples include <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="bf6be9f60d-software-simple-0">NudgerSize</rs> TM (an iPhone application that sends daily exercise reminders to users), electronic pill bottles, glucometers and other devices that transmit information from the patient to the provider. <ref type="bibr">55</ref> Automatic entry into a daily lottery for taking pills is another example. While there are advantages to using automated hovering (e.g. less resource intensive option for daily engagement), it is not for everyone. Asch et al. <ref type="bibr">60</ref> explain that cell phones and automatic pill bottle reminders are not ideal for someone frequently hospitalized who likely requires a more personnel-intensive approach. In a RCT using electronic pill bottles to improve warfarin adherence, only patients with baseline international normalized ratio (INR) below the therapeutic range showed significant improvements in anticoagulation, indicating that the intervention worked for only a subset of the population. <ref type="bibr">51</ref> Studies using financial incentives to influence a behavioral response varied in their effectiveness. Of those with evidence of effectiveness, many included some form of interaction with health care professionals or peers, and most behaviors reverted back to baseline once the intervention stops. Similarly, offering co-payment reductions through value-based insurance design or linking premiums to healthy behaviors has only had modest impacts. <ref type="bibr">55</ref> In a 2009 systematic review, adult RTRs, when offered free IST, were 95% adherent 6 months post-transplant yet only 48% adherent at 12 months with many becoming non-adherent by the 10th month. The conclusion was that cost does not appear to influence adherence. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Volpp et al. <ref type="bibr">61</ref> explain the effectiveness of the incentive depends on how they are framed, timed, and distributed, and should ideally be small and combined with frequent positive feedback and rewards.</p>

            <p>Statistical Analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) were used as a measure of the association between the TNF-a 308G.A polymorphism and RHD risk. We evaluated the risk of the AA or GA genotype on RHD compared with the GG genotypes, and then calculated the ORs of GA/AA versus GG and AA versus GG/GA, using dominant and recessive genetic models of the A allele, respectively. Pooled estimates of the OR were obtained by calculating a weighted average of OR from eligible study. The betweenstudy heterogeneity I 2 was assessed with the Q-test <ref type="bibr">31</ref>. Heterogeneity was considered significant if the P , 0.05 among studies. The pooled OR was calculated using the fixed-effects model. Otherwise, the random-effects model was used. The HWE was assessed by Fisher's exact test with significance set at P , 0.05 level. The potential publication bias was constructed by a funnel plot. The funnel plot symmetry was evaluated by using Egger's linear regression test on the natural logarithm scale of the OR and significance was set at P , 0.05 level.

            <p>We conducted a survey of 277 patients who scored over 13 on the Glasgow coma scale who received treatment at our institution after minor head trauma in the period from January 2012 to December 2013. Patients were enrolled prospectively and their medical records were reviewed retrospectively. All the patients did not require surgery at the time of their arrival. During the follow-up period, the 20 patients who required surgery to treat CSDH were designated as the patient group, while the remaining 257 patients who did not develop CSDH after minor head trauma and completed treatment were selected as the control group. Head trauma, out of many other factors, was set as the controlled variable. Age, gender, and the history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, cerebral infarction, cardiac disease, hematologic disease, and epilepsy were investigated as the factors contributing to progression of CSDH after minor trauma. The medication history of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents was also surveyed, as well as the smoking and drinking habits of subjects. The presence of acute subdural hematoma (AS-DH) in the convexity, accompanying hemorrhage and encephalomalacia, and the maximum distance from skull to cerebral parenchyma <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) were investigated by examining the patients' initial computerized tomography (CT) scans. In our study, cardiac disease included valve disease, arrhythmia, and ischemic heart disease. The diseases that could cause coagulopathy, such as hematological malignancies, were defined as hematologic disease. In cases where the patients' initial brain CT scans showed cerebral contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage, or intracerebral hemorrhage, we defined the finding as an accompanying hemorrhage. The statistical analysis was performed using Window <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d81b741955-software-0">SPSS</rs> version <rs corresp="#d81b741955-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">20.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#d81b741955-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical analyses included chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess the relationship between CSDH and various factors. Differences were considered statistically significant if the p value was less than 0.05.</p>

Briefly, single cell suspension has obtained from parent and spheroid cells have plated at concentration of 1000, 100, 10 cells and 1 cell per well in 0.2 ml of CSC medium in 96-well ultra-low attachment (Getbiofil, UK) and cultured for 7 days in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . The number of wells containing of colonospheres has counted after 7 days.

            <p>In this study, we have found that human HT-29 colonic adenocarcinoma cells could form spheroid colonies in a serum-free medium containing. To investigate the capability of colon spheres differentiation, these cells have cultivated in 10% FBS medium rather than EGF and FGF-2. In present serum, spherical undifferentiated cells have attached to the plate, and differentiated into adherent cells with epithelial cell morphology <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). In serum free condition, the expression levels of EpCAM and CD44 were significantly higher in spheroid than parent cells (P &lt; 0.001) <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). The results have demonstrated that 92.3 ± 3.6% of these tumor spheroid cells were CD44+/EpCAM+, while parent cells only have expressed 38.4 ± 1.6% of CD44+/EpCAM+ markers. We have measured ALDH1 activity in colonospheres and parent cells-derived colonic HT-29 cell line. Interestingly, we have found that HT29 cells have exhibited substantially high levels of ALDH activity in the parent fractions in compared with the spheroid fractions. ALDH activity was 16.9 ± 1.2 in spheroid cells in comparison with 34.6 ± 2.3 in parental cells (P &lt; 0.05) <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>. We have evaluated the frequency of sphere-forming cells by doing an <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dca4836260-software-simple-6">extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA)</rs> for spheroid and parent-derived HT-29 cells. The results have indicated that the frequency of spheroid formation in cell line -derived colonospheres were 6.4 fold higher than -derived the parent cells (P &lt; 0.005) <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). The findings have suggested that colonospheres have formed by the colon cancer cell have enriched population of CSCs.</p>

Thus, it has suggested under extreme limited dilution and in serum-free conditions, spheroids could only formed from stem-like cells. Consequently, the formation of colonospheres with a very small number of HT-29 cell line has demonstrated enrichment CSCs in colonospheres <ref type="bibr">(2, 7, 20)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The delivery approach combines elective courses in basic veterinary techniques for complementary or recurring aspects of studies with mandatory training provided in collaboration with TiHo clinics and institutes. However, elective practice and reinforcement of practical skills in small groups and the possibility of intensive preparation and follow-up of teaching content through independent study are still the main tools for learning. The increasing inclusion of self-teaching elements will focus increasingly on the acquisition of practical competencies. The approach will incorporate various forms of teaching, including peer-assisted teaching, cognitive apprenticeships, workshops (with a maximum of 8 students per group) and problem-oriented learning (POL). To this end, special teaching materials (guidance notes, display panels, posters, case studies etc.) are designed and complemented by open educational resources (OERs). This involvesusing resources such as WikiVet <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>. Some documents (text, images and videos) will be made available to other universities under creative commons (CC) licences via WikiVet, Vetipedia or in the form of e-books. Existing video podcasts produced by the skills lab will be the focus of the OERs. Clinical skills learning through simulations on models (low-fidelity, medium-fidelity) will be accompanied and complemented by videos available from the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="f54c3f1358-software-simple-0">YouTube</rs> channel (http://www.youtube.com/ user/TiHoVideos) which was set up in April 2012. Training videos for classes and to demonstrate particular skills on models/simulators and on live patients are continuously being created. To date, 52 videos have been created with 116 subscribers and 30,734 hits (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, as at 30 September 2013). The videos are useful not only as preparation for a session in the skills lab, but also as a chance to verify or reinforce particular skills. The skills lab opened in February 2013 and since then has been available to students during and between semesters. Initial evaluations of the 769 visits to the teaching stations from March to September 2013 show that there was a high level of interest, and not just during semesters, in the elective teaching on offer in the skills lab of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation (se <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>. The largest user group is students in semesters 7-8, as they are approaching the practical year in semesters 9-10. At the time of writing, our investigations have not found any other veterinary educational establishments in Germany with skills labs, in contrast with other countries (both in Europe and further afield), which offer numerous training centres and use veterinary simulators as part of their curriculum <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>. To date, there are no reports or experiments on establishing training centres in application of the Veterinary Licensing Ordinance (TAppV). The reasons for this can only be speculated -on the one hand, the TAppV and the related range of competency requirements is diverse, and not all day-one skills can be taught in a skills lab <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>; on the other, veterinary studies in the past tended to focus exclusively on imparting knowledge, while practical education and skills training was normally carried out at the initiative of the universities themselves, using their own animals and patients in their own clinics <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>. The required resources and the specific nature of local structures are decisive when setting up a skills lab. In addition to the cost of the necessary premises, the equipment itself (simulators, devices etc.) and the overheads (staff, consumables etc.) are very costly <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. Currently the TiHo skills lab has more than 40 models. In addition, devices and diagnostic equipment (ultrasound, endoscopy etc.) as well as a haptic trainer for transrectal examinations are provided <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>. The estimated costs totalled some EUR 480,000. 6-8 student research assistants are currently engaged in the maintenance and coordination of the teaching content, along with one fulltime member of the teaching staff who provides veterinary guidance in the skills lab. We were only able to cover this significant outlay thanks to financial support from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) aspart of the teaching quality package (Qualitätspakt Lehre).</p>

            <p>A shotgun metagenomics approach was applied on all three size fractions of four samples from Lakes Cisó and Banyoles C-III.

KO annotation was used for functional analysis and KO counts were normalized according to the length of the read and the length of the target gene <ref type="bibr">(Sharon et al., 2009)</ref>. The communities and functional profiles found in each size fraction were highly similar (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>) and, therefore, we pooled all reads after normalizing for sequencing depth for subsequent analyses, which allows for a better comparison of metagenomes. The functional analyses focused on the three main biogeochemical cycles for this type of lakes, that is, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) cycling. The genetic potential of the microbial community was analyzed following the C, N, and S marker genes (KOs) as reported by <ref type="bibr">Lauro et al. (2011)</ref> with a few modifications. We amended this previous rubric by adding the anaerobic carbon fixation carried out through the Calvin cycle by Chromatiaceae, and additional genes for polysulfide reduction, nitrate reduction and nitrite oxidation. In addition, the genes pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (porA/B) were not considered as marker genes for fermentation as in <ref type="bibr">Lauro et al. (2011)</ref>, because they are key genes in the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle used for carbon fixation by Epsilonproteobacteria abundant in our study lakes <ref type="bibr">(Campbell and Cary, 2004; Takai et al., 2005)</ref>. Because both sulfide oxidation and dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathways are mediated by the same set of genes (aprA, aprB and dsrA) but are found in different families of bacteria, we assigned metagenomic reads to each pathway according to phylogeny, that is, sulfate reduction for Firmicutes and Deltaproteobacteria reads, and sulfide oxidation for Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Chlorobiaceae and Chromatiaceae. Finally, for the sulfur-oxidizing Epsilonproteobacteria of the order Campylobacterales we specifically searched for sox genes (coding for thiosulfate oxidation) not currently available in the KEGG database. Marker genes used in the present work are shown in Supplementary Table S1.

            <p>Our beat synchronization task was based on Kirshner and Tomasello's (2009) social drumming entrainment paradigm for preschoolers. The experimenter sat across from the child with two conga drums between them, one for the experimenter and one for the participant. Each conga had a Pulse Percussion DR-1 drum trigger attached to the underside of its drumhead to record the drum hits and convert vibrations into voltage in real time with no delay. The experimenter covertly listened and drummed to an isochronous beat presented through an in-ear headphone and encouraged the child to imitate and drum along with the experimenter. Auditory stimuli and drum hits of both the experimenter and participant were recorded as two separate two-channel recordings in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e4ab54fee2-software-0">Audacity</rs> version <rs corresp="#e4ab54fee2-software-0" resp="#annotator7" type="version">2.0.5</rs>. Four trials were performed: two trials at 2.5 Hz followed by two trials at 1.67 Hz. Each trial was 20 s in duration, resulting in 50 isochronous drum hits for the 2.5 Hz trials and 33 drum hits for the 1.67 Hz trials. The use of two rates allowed for the assessment of general synchronization ability as opposed to synchronization to a specific rate, reducing the potential bias of an individual's preferred tempo.</p>
            <p>2.2.1. Data processing-Synchronization data were processed using software developed in house in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e4ab54fee2-software-2">MATLAB</rs> (<rs corresp="#e4ab54fee2-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Mathworks, Inc</rs>., Natick, MA). Due to the high intersubject variability in intensity and rapidity of drumming, drum hits for the experimenter and participant were detected by setting an amplitude threshold and a refractory period on a participant-by-participant basis. The first point at which the signal exceeded the amplitude threshold was marked as a hit, immediately followed by a refractory period during which the program did not mark peaks (to ensure multiple points were not marked for each hit). Accuracy of automated hit detection was checked manually to ensure onsets were correctly marked for each hit. <ref type="bibr">(Fisher, 1993)</ref>, a useful tool for assessing sensorimotor synchronization when there is not one-to-one correspondence of hits and pacing stimuli <ref type="bibr">(Kirschner and Tomasello, 2009; Sowiński and Dalla Bella, 2013; Fujii and Schlaug, 2013)</ref>, as is the case with this dataset: children frequently missed hits or did not synchronize continuously over a session. Each drum hit was assigned a relative phase angle (θ or "accuracy") in degrees by subtracting the hit time from the nearest experimenter's hit, dividing the result by the ISI, and multiplying by 360. The mean of all vectors resulted in R, a measurement of the extent to which participants tended to maintain a constant temporal relationship between their drum hits and the experimenter's. We define beat synchronization "consistency" as the average vector length across each of the two trials and across both rates. These two measures seem largely independent (correlation between consistency and accuracy: r (25) = −0.275, p = 0.183). Recent work has shown the ability to synchronize to an external beat is still developing during this age <ref type="bibr">(Kirschner and Tomasello, 2009; Woodruff Carr et al., 2014)</ref>. Therefore, Rayleigh's test was applied to the set of all vectors produced in the two trials for a given rate to determine whether a participant was successfully synchronizing (the null hypothesis of this test is that the distribution of data points occur randomly in time near or away from the pacing stimuli onsets, indicative of chance performance; p &gt; 0.05). The two trials at each rate were combined to compute a Rayleigh's p-value for each rate. If a child's Rayleigh's test resulted in a p &lt;0.05 at both rates, the child was included in analyses. Our previous work (Woodruff <ref type="bibr">Carr et al., 2014)</ref> investigated group differences in neural processing between children who could (p &lt; 0.05) and could not (p &gt; 0.05) synchronize; the current investigation expands upon this work by investigating neural correlates of synchronization ability within an expanded group of successful synchronizers. <ref type="bibr">(Klatt, 1980</ref>Additionally, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were collected to a 100 µs square wave click stimulus presented in rarefaction at 80 dB SPL at a 31.3 Hz sampling rate. 2000 sweeps were presented.</p>
            <p>were presented monaurally to the right ear through an insert earphone (ER-3, Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, IL) while the participant sat watching a movie of their choice in a sound-attenuated booth (IAC Acoustics, Bronx, NY). The left ear remained unblocked so that the soundtrack of the movie (&lt;40 dB SPL) was audible but not loud enough to mask presented stimuli. FFRs were collected using BioSEMI Active2 with an ActiABR module recorded in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e4ab54fee2-software-5">LabView</rs> <rs corresp="#e4ab54fee2-software-5" resp="#annotator7" type="version">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#e4ab54fee2-software-5" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Instruments</rs>, Austin, TX). Responses were digitized at 16.384 kHz and collected with an online bandpass filter from 100 to 3000 Hz (20 dB/decade roll-off). The active electrode was placed at the vertex (Cz), with references on each earlobe. Grounding electrodes CMS and DRL were placed on the forehead at Fp1 and Fp2, respectively. Only ipsilateral-referenced (Cz-Right earlobe) responses were used in analyses. Offset voltage was &lt;50 mV for all electrodes.</p>
            <p>to speech stimuli were offline amplified in the frequency domain 20 dB per decade for 3 decades below 100 Hz, bandpass filtered from 70 to 2000 Hz (12 dB/octave roll-off), segmented into epochs with an interval of −40 to 210 ms (in relation to the stimulus onset), and baseline-corrected to the pre-stimulus period. Responses exceeding ±35 µV were rejected as artifacts and remaining sweeps were averaged. Final responses to each syllable comprised 2000 artifact-free sweeps of each polarity, and responses to the two polarities were added to accentuate the response to the speech envelope <ref type="bibr">(Aiken and Picton, 2008)</ref> and limit the influence of cochlear microphonic and stimulus artifact <ref type="bibr">(Campbell et al., 2012)</ref>.

            <p>The FFR faithfully reproduces spectrotemporal stimulus features due to the inferior colliculus' ability to encode fine timing information <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al., 2006; Warrier et al., 2011)</ref>. Intertrial stability of the ABR was assessed using a procedure previously reported <ref type="bibr">(Hornickel and Kraus, 2013; Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b)</ref>.To calculate the stability of a participant's response to the speech stimuli, 2000 of 4000 trials were randomly selected and averaged. The remaining 2000 trials were also averaged. The two sub-averaged waveforms were then correlated over the 0 to 170 ms range to determine their similarity. These steps were repeated 300 different times, each with different random samplings of trials, and the 300 correlation values were averaged to generate a final measure of intertrial neural response stability. Neural stability for encoding the click stimulus was assessed over 0 to 11.95 ms of the response using the same methodology: the two subaveraged waveforms (1000 randomly selected, averaged trials) were correlated to determine similarity 100 times, each with different random samplings of trials, and the correlation values were averaged. To specifically examine the timing variability in frequency encoding of the 170 ms speech-evoked FFR, intertrial phase-locking <ref type="bibr">(Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b)</ref> was calculated in 20 Hz windows surrounding the fundamental frequency of the stimulus (100 Hz) and its harmonics up to 1000 Hz. Time-frequency spectrum was calculated using a short-time fast Fourier transform that resulted in a matrix containing two measures for each time × frequency point: a vector length (the extent to which each frequency is encoded in the FFR) and phase (the timing of that frequency). To specifically analyze the timing variability, each vector was transformed into a unit vector. For each frequency, the 4000 vectors were averaged and the length of the resulting vector was calculated as a measure of the consistency of phase across trials. Low frequency phase-locking was captured by averaging across the vectors for 100, 200, 300, and 400 Hz, while high frequency phase-locking was computed as a mean of the vectors for harmonics 500-1000 Hz. Intertrial neural stability and phase-locking correlation values were Fisher and log transformed to conform to the expectations of a linear model (normality and sphericity). Data analysis occurred in<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e4ab54fee2-software-simple-8">MATLAB</rs>.</p>
            <p>Pearson correlations were used to compare intertrial neural stability and phase-locking across stimuli (mean of [ba] + [da] + [ga]) to beat synchronization consistency. Phaselocking was averaged across low-frequency harmonics (100-400 Hz) and high-frequency harmonics (500-1000 Hz). Hierarchical two-step linear regressions were employed to determine how neural stability and phase-locking predicted variance in beat synchronization over and above demographic factors.

            <p>Combination proliferation assay. The cytotoxic effect of TMZ or/and MET on GSCs was measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Briefly, U87 and C6 gliospheres were cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates (5x10 3 per 100 µl per well) in NBM with B27, N2, glutaMAX, 2 µg/ml heparin and 20 ng/ml EGF+bFGF at 37˚C for 24 h, then different concentrations of TMZ (0-3.2 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) or MET (0-160 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) were added and compared with the DMSO-treated control. The CCK-8 reagent (10 µl/well) was added at 93 h, and the OD was measured at 450 nm after 96 h using a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). In order to determine the combination cytotoxic effect on GSCs, parallel studies were performed in cells treated with TMZ (0-3.2 mmol) plus MET (0-160 mmol) (1:50, TMZ:MET).

We used the mean value of both eyes for all parameters. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare parameters between the two groups. The Spearman rank-order correlation test was used to evaluate the relationships between variables in the patients with Sjögren dry eye disease. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant in all analyses. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the clinical characteristics of the 155 study participants. Their mean age was 52.7 ± 12.0 years, and 148 (95.5%) were female. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the mean (±stan-dard deviation) values for the ocular surface parameters, i.e., OSDI score, tear film break-up time, Schirmer I test, tear osmolarity, and OSS. In the Sjögren dry eye group (n = 39), mean tear osmolarity in SS was 311.1 ± 16.4 mOsm/ L, and 16 measurements (41.0%) were over 316 mOsm/L. Mean tear film break-up time was 3.0 ± 2.1 seconds, and 35 measures (89.7%) were ≤5 mm. The mean Schirmer I test value was 5.4 ± 6.9, and 24 measures (61.5%) were ≤5 mm, indicating significant dry eye. In the non-Sjögren dry eye group (n = 116), mean tear osmolarity was 297.7 ± 12.7 mOsm/L, and 11 measures (9.5%) were over 316 mOsm/L. Mean tear film break-up time was 4.6 ± 1.9 seconds, and 76 measures (65.5%) were ≤5 mm. The mean Schirmer Itest value was 6.7 ± 6.5, and 61 measures (52.6%) were ≤5 mm. Tear osmolarity value and OSS were higher in the Sjögren dry eye group. In contrast, the tear film break-up time value was higher in the non-Sjögren dry eye group. The scatter plots in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> show correlations between tear osmolarity and other ocular surface parameters in the Sjögren dry eye group. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between mean tear osmolarity and OSDI score (ρ = 0.405, p = 0.011) and OSS (ρ = 0.592, p &lt; 0.001). There was also a statistically significant negative correlation between mean tear osmolarity and the Schirmer I test (ρ = -0.625, p &lt; 0.001). However, there was no significant correlation between mean tear osmolarity and tear film break-up time (ρ = 0.110, p = 0.505).</p>

            <p>HRCT scans were performed in 0.69 mm slices with a CT scanner (Sensation 16, Siemens Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). After the imaging data were stored in a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e61b8f0b82-software-simple-0">Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM)</rs> file, they were imported to a personal computer. All scanning was performed at constant window level and width settings of 300 and 330 H, because every change in the window level and width settings resulted in deviating values with respect to the muscle size on CT scan. The coronal reconstructions were modified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e61b8f0b82-software-1">3D-DOCTOR</rs> software (<rs corresp="#e61b8f0b82-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Able Software Co</rs>., Lexington, MA, USA), so that the nasal floor in the coronal and sagittal planes was horizontal. Sequential coronal planes were observed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e61b8f0b82-software-simple-3">3D-DOCTOR</rs> software and simultaneous multiplanar reconstructions in bone algorithm format were reconstructed in the axial and sagittal planes. The positions of the coronal plane on which the measurements were taken were defined as the AE (anterior wall of bulla ethmoidalis that was removed first during anterior ethmoidectomy), BL (the basal lamella through which posterior ethmoidectomy was performed), and PE (the midportion of the posterior ethmoid sinus in the sagittal plane) in order to evaluate the intraorbital structures in view of the ethmoidectomy <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. Through multiplanar reconstructions, the coronal planes that were equivalent to the positions of the AE, BL, and PE were identified exactly.</p>
            <p>To evaluate the position of the trochlea of the SO, the relationship between the trochlea and the opening of the frontal sinus (FO) was assessed in the parasagittal plane. The imaginary point, which was equivalent to the position of the trochlea coronally and axially, was drawn in the parasagittal plane, which was equivalent to the midportion of the FO. The vertical distance from the frontal beak to imaginary point, anteroposterior distance from the anterior wall of the frontal sinus to imaginary point, and anteroposterior distance from the frontal beak to imaginary point were measured in the parasagittal plane. In addition, the horizontal distance from the midline to the trochlea was measured in the coronal plane, where the trochlea was identified <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref>. Statistical analysis was done using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e61b8f0b82-software-3">SPSS</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#e61b8f0b82-software-3" resp="#annotator3" type="version">18</rs> (<rs corresp="#e61b8f0b82-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical comparisons between genders and laterality were performed using t-test. Pearson's correlations were applied to define the relationship of the measurements with aging. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

            <p><ref type="bibr">(Pritchard and others 2000)</ref> subpopulations is a measure of the number of population subgroups in the data set. Analyses were run as described (Mellanby and others 2013) using the results for 15 microsatellite markers, and both South African dogs and the UK dogs previously reported by Mellanby and others <ref type="formula">(2013)</ref> were included. <ref type="figure">Fig 1</ref> shows the outcome of this analysis when K (number of contributing subpopulations) was set at 6. The result was the same with higher values of K. This analysis showed that within a breed the dogs were genetically very similar regardless of the country. Jack Russell terriers showed equal contributions from different subpopulations, whereas labrador retrievers and German shepherd dogs each showed 90 per cent contribution from a single subpopulation. Jack Russell terriers had very little contribution from either of the subpopulations predominant in the labrador retrievers or German shepherd dogs, as might be expected given the very different phenotype and ancestry of these dogs. The admixture of subpopulations within a breed was the same regardless of country, showing that the breeds have not diverged greatly. To further test this, each breed was subjected individually to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a628056558-software-simple-0">STRUCTURE</rs> analysis. There was no evidence of stratification based on country of origin at K=2 or higher K values <ref type="figure">(Fig 2)</ref>. As previously reported (Mellanby and others 2013), misclassification of dog breed was common with four of the South African labrador retrievers and one of the German shepherd dogs showing mixed breed ancestry, whereas several others had a 50 per cent contribution from one subpopulation suggesting a one parent of the associated breed and one of another breed or mixed breed background. FIG 1: <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a628056558-software-simple-1">STRUCTURE</rs> analysis of three dog breeds from the UK and South Africa. Genotypes for 15 microsatellites for dogs of all three breeds from South Africa and the UK were entered into the program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a628056558-software-simple-2">STRUCTURE</rs> and the analysis run with a burn-in period of 100,000 replications and a run of 500,000 replications <ref type="bibr">(Mellanby and others 2013)</ref>. Runs were repeated between two and five times for each value of K to assess the stability of the population structure detected. The results are shown for a typical run with K=6. Each vertical column represents a different dog, whereas the shades of grey represent six different subpopulations in the admixture. The y axis shows the proportional of the genotype attributed to each subpopulation for each dogThis analysis shows that the assignment of dogs to pedigree classes on the basis of genotype is robust across the two countries and there is little evidence for genetic drift within breeds, reflecting the similarity of the breed standards between the two countries. This may be maintained by the import of dogs from other countries and the exchange of semen for artificial insemination. Artificial insemination from cryopreserved domestic dog semen has been available since the 1960s <ref type="bibr">(Thomassen and Farstad 2009</ref>) and use of artificial insemination has increased among pedigree dog breeders as technologies have developed to preserve and transport semen. Although this could benefit the breed and enhance genetic diversity by varying the sires used by a breeder, it is also seen as a cost-effective method to maximise the number of progeny of popular sires <ref type="bibr">(Thomassen and Farstad 2009)</ref>, hence restricting the gene pool. Worldwide use of semen from a small number of sires may have the effect of maintaining the homogeneity of the breed across geographically separated regions. The heterozygosity of the Jack Russell has been maintained in South Africa, indicating that registration as a breed and the need to conform to breed standard has not reduced genetic diversity at this point.</p>

            <p>Original trace analysis (done and then compared with the method described here) was performed using a custom-written <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b49b10600b-software-6">Lab- View</rs> (<rs corresp="#b49b10600b-software-6" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Instruments</rs>, Austin, TX) software code similar to previously described procedures <ref type="bibr">(Pitchiaya et al., 2012, 2013)</ref>. In short, the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="b49b10600b-software-simple-2">LabView</rs> code uses noise-filtering and photon-counting histogram algorithms to identify particles of interest and removes nonuniform background from all selected traces. The data were filtered further by a nonlinear ChungKennedy noise filter to preserve fast and sudden signal transitions while averaging out random noise. The filtered data were then assessed by eye, with each sudden decrease in signal classified as a photobleaching event. For each trace, the number of photobleaching events corresponds to the total fluorescent miR-7 molecules within a focus since &gt;90% of dye molecules are found to be fluorescent <ref type="bibr">(Pitchiaya et al., 2012, 2013)</ref>.</p>
            <p>To test the photobleaching event counting method described here in a biological context, we conducted a single-molecule photobleaching analysis to test the oligomerization state of transfected fluorescent miR-7 duplex in fixed HeLa cells. Six hours after transfection, our cells were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution, immersed in OSS, and illuminated using HILO fluorescence microscopy. Videos of single cells were acquired until all cellular fluorescent particles were photobleached into a permanent dark state. The original analysis was performed as described; via our custom <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="b49b10600b-software-simple-3">LabView</rs> software, fluorescent particles were identified and background subtracted. Then noise was filtered to help identify by eye intensity transitions relevant to the photobleaching process. The results of this original analysis method were then compared with the results we acquired by first using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="b49b10600b-software-simple-4">Lab View</rs> code just to select areas of interest and then processing the traces with our full Bayesian code.</p>

            <p>Behavioural analysis. Behavioural analysis was performed to assess the development of tactile allodynia in mice. Tactile allodynia was measured using a von Frey filament (North Coast Medical, Gilroy, CA, USA). Mice were placed in glass cages with a wire mesh bottom and allowed to habituate for at least 1 h. A von Frey filament with bending forces of 0.16 g (innocuous stimulation) was pressed perpendicularly against the plantar skin of a hind-paw. The paw withdrawal responses to the mechanical stimulus were evaluated by scoring as follows: 0, no response; 1, lifting the hind-paw within 3 s; 2, lifting the hind-paw over 3 s; and 3, immediate flinching or licking of the hind-paw. The stimulation of the same intensity was applied seven times to each hind-paw at several seconds intervals and the total served as the pain-related score (score) in the SNL model. The behavioural data were analyzed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a4b9899206-software-0">Origin</rs> (<rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microcal software Inc</rs>., Sunnyvale, MA, USA) software to determine the IC 50 values.</p>
            <p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from substantia gelatinosa neurons. The substantia gelatinosa was easily discernible with transmitted illumination as a relatively translucent band across the dorsal horn in the transverse or parasagittal slice preparations. Blind whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from SG neurons, as previously described. <ref type="bibr">53,54</ref> The patch pipettes were filled with potassium gluconate solution, a solution containing (in mM); 135 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES, and 5 ATP-Mg (pH 7.2). The tip resistance of the patch pipettes was 6-12 MO. Series resistance was assessed from current in response to a 5-mV hyperpolarizing step. Series resistance was monitored during the recording session and data were rejected if its value changed by 415%. Ion currents were monitored with a patchclamp amplifier (Axopatch 700A, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The data were digitized with an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1321A, Molecular Devices), stored on a personal computer using a data acquisition program (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a4b9899206-software-1">Clampex</rs> version <rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-1" resp="#annotator4" type="version">10</rs>, <rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>) and analyzed using a software package<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a4b9899206-software-2">Clampfit</rs> version <rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-2" resp="#annotator4" type="version">10</rs> (<rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>).

            <p>Analysis was performed using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a390909d47-software-0">NONMEM</rs> (v <rs corresp="#a390909d47-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">7.2.0</rs>, <rs corresp="#a390909d47-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">ICON Development Solutions</rs>, MD, USA). The different tissues (tear, naso-lacrymal duct, cornea, aqueous humor) were considered as different compartments. Because of its physiology, each eye was considered as an individual <ref type="bibr">[8, 9]</ref>. So, a total of 84 individuals were considered in the dataset.</p>
            <p>In addition to the global multi-compartmental structure, many model configurations were tested, e.g., first-order rate constant or inter-compartmental clearance between the different compartments, a drug cleared or not from the naso-lacrymal duct, a drug cleared or not from the cornea, either fixed volumes of distribution at known physiological values to avoid an over-parameterization of the model or let free to be estimated by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a390909d47-software-simple-3">NONMEM</rs>. Regarding the nanosuspension formulation, two kinetics of administration situations were tested for nanosuspensions (1) administration with zero-order kinetic in the tear, in this case it would allow estimating the duration of the nanosuspension dissolution in the tear or (2) administration as a bolus as it was done for the solution. In the last case, the only way to take into account the formulation was to test it as a binary covariate on the relevant model parameters. The estimation of inter-individual variability (g) was evaluated using either a constant coefficient variation (CV) or proportional error model. The full non diagonal matrix (x-block) and the different combinations of g correlations were evaluated as well as the possibility to fix some x 2 to zero. The selection of a x-block, if any, was made on the basis of the objective function value (OFV) decrease. Many algorithms were tested only one by one or by a combination. Given the complexity of the current model and the multi-compartmental structure, several differential equation solvers were evaluated. The model selection was performed on the basis of the knowledge of the eye structure, the minimization status (i.e., successful), the covariance phase (i.e., completed without any warning message), the absence of any correlation between parameter estimates larger than 0.95, the examination of standard error of the parameter estimates (i.e., B50 %), significant digit of the final parameter estimates (i.e., 3.0). The best pharmacostatistical model was selected based on the lowest OFV and the inspection of goodness of fits, i.e., population and individual weighted residuals (CWRES and IWRES), observed tissue concentrations (DV, for dependent variable) plots versus population and individual predicted concentrations (PRED and IPRED).</p>

            <p>Yeast cultures were imaged after growth at 30°C to mid-log phase in synthetic defined media supplemented with either 2% glucose (SD plus glucose) or 2% galactose plus 2% raffinose (SD plus galactose/ raffinose; the latter for induction of Num1 CC , Pac1, or Kip2, as indicated). To assess the effects of Num1 CC on localization of dynein pathway components, GAL1p:num1 CC cells were induced in SD plus galactose/raffinose for 6 h before mounting cells for fluorescence microscopy. For wide-field fluorescence microscopy, yeast cells were imaged on an agarose pad containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and images were collected at room temperature using a 1.49 NA 100× objective on a Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with a Ti-S-E motorized stage (Nikon), piezo Z-control (Physik Instrumente), a SOLA SM II LE LED light engine (Lumencor), a motorized filter cube turret, and an iXon X3 DU897 cooled EM-CCD camera (Andor). The microscope system was controlled by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="bd7779a9c7-software-simple-0">NIS-Elements</rs> software (Nikon). A step size of 1 µm was used to acquire 2-µm-thick Z-stack images. Sputtered/ET filter cube sets (Chroma Technology) were used for imaging mTurquoise2 (49001), GFP (49002), YFP (49003), and mCherry (49008) fluorescence.</p>

Plus end and SPB foci were identified in two (or three) color movies and scored accordingly. Specifically, plus end molecules were recognized as those foci that localized to the distal tips of dynamic microtubules (identified via mTurquoise2-Tub1 imaging), whereas SPB molecules were recognized as those foci that localized to one of the spindle poles. Cortical molecules (e.g., in PH-Dyn1-expressing cells) were identified as those foci not associated with an astral microtubule plus end that remained stationary at the cell cortex for at least three frames. Two data sets were considered statistically significant if a Student's t test (assuming unequal variance) returned a p-value &lt; 0.05.</p>

            <p>Genotyping of the CTLA4 +49A/G and FCER1B -654C/T polymorphisms DNA was isolated from blood samples using a G-DEX II kit (iNtRon, Seoul, Korea). The CTLA4 +49A/G (rs231775) was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP). Experimental settings were confirmed by comparing cases with the results of DNA sequencing. PCR products were formed in a reaction volume of 15 μL that contained 30 ng of template DNA, 0.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 1.5 μL of MgCl2-free 10× buffer (Applied Biosystems), 0.9 μL of 25 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5 μL of each specific primer 5'-AAGGCTCAGCTGAACCTGGTT-3' and 5'-CTGCT-GAAACAAATGAAACCC-3' for CTLA4 +49A/G and 0.75 μL of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (2.5 mmol/L of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate). The cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 12 minutes, 35 cycles at 95°C for 30 seconds, annealing for 1 minute at 54°C for CTLA4 +49A/G and extension at 72°C for 40 seconds, followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 10 minutes. The CTLA4 +49A allele was digested into 135 and 18 base pair (bp) fragments using BstE II (New England http://e-aair.org BioLabs, Beverly, MA) at 60°C for 2 hours, and products verified on a 3.5% agarose gel (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). The FCER1B -654C/T (rs574700) was genotyped using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b1bec48556-software-2">Primer Express</rs> (<rs corresp="#b1bec48556-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Applied Biosystems</rs>) was used to design the MGB TaqMan probes. One allelic probe was labeled with the fluorescent FAM dye and the other with the VIC dye. PCRs were run in a TaqMan universal master mix without UNG (Applied Biosystems) using PCR primer concentrations of 900 nM and TaqMan MGB-probe concentrations of 200 nM. Reactions were performed in a 384-well format in a total reaction volume of 5 μL using 20 ng of genomic DNA. The plates then were placed in a thermal cycler (PE 9700; Applied Biosystems) and heated at 50°C for 2 minutes and 95°C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minutes, with a final soak at 25°C. The TaqMan assay plates were transferred to the Prism 7900HT instruments (Applied Biosystems), where the fluorescence intensity in each well of the plate was read. Fluorescence data files from each plate were analyzed by automated allele-calling software (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b1bec48556-software-0">SDS</rs> <rs corresp="#b1bec48556-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">2.1</rs>).</p>
            <p>The clinical parameters (total IgE, PC20, total eosinophil count, FEV1 (%)) were analyzed according to the Kruskal-Wallis test among the four groups as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. To analyze the association between the genotypes and asthma, we adopted a dominant model since relatively few individuals were homozygous for the risk alleles. Since the age and sex displayed differences between controls and patients with asthma, a logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and sex was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The relationship between clinical phenotypes and genotypes was tested using the independent t-test; the analysis of increasing trend of aOR and log IgE was followed by a logistic and linear regression, respectively. All statistical analyses were performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b1bec48556-software-1">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#b1bec48556-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">14.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#b1bec48556-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL), and a P value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

The simulation of the Helical Wheel Projection of the MITS1 N-terminal was from http://rzlab.ucr.edu/scripts/ wheel/wheel.cgi (D Armstrong and R Zidovetzki).</p>
            <p>Imaging was performed using an upright Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope LSM510 META (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a 363 water immersion objective. Transformed leaves were analysed 48 h after infection of the lower epidermis. For imaging expression of YFP constructs, GFP constructs or both, the imaging settings as described by <ref type="bibr">Brandizzi et al. (2002)</ref> were used. Appropriate controls were used to exclude the possibility of energy transfer between fluorochromes and cross-talk. Images were acquired using non-saturating settings and the same imaging parameters were used.

            <p>MITS1 (AGI: At1g52080) is a putative actin-binding protein of 573 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 66 kDa. The N-terminal region of this protein (39 amino acids) contains a hydrophobic stretch of 20 residues (predicted with <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="c6676625dc-software-simple-6">TMHMM</rs> and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="c6676625dc-software-simple-7">TMPred</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Hofmann and Stoffel, 1993; Krogh et al., 2001)</ref> and flanking regions enriched with positively-charged amino acids <ref type="figure">Fig. 1A)</ref>. Because of the predicted secondary structure of this sequence, various publicly available bio-informatics tools suggest targeting of MITS1 to mitochondria (see Materials and methods). To confirm this prediction experimentally, full-length MITS1 was fused to the N-terminus of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1A)</ref>, and the resulting construct was expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells for live cell confocal microscopy analyses. For simplicity, this construct was named MITS1. MITS1 appeared in numerous structures of heterogeneous size and shape <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B)</ref>, resembling the previously described appearance of plant mitochondria <ref type="bibr">(Logan and Leaver, 2000)</ref>. Co-localization analyses of MITS1 with b-ATPase:GFP, a known mitochondrial marker <ref type="bibr">(Logan and Leaver, 2000)</ref>, confirmed that MITS1 localizes to mitochondria <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B)</ref>, thus providing experimental support for our prediction. These observations prompted us to carry out a functional dissection of the NH 2 -terminal extension of MITS1 to identify the targeting determinants within this region.</p>
            <p>The pre-sequence amphipathicity influences the targeting of MITS1 At present, the biological function of MITS1 remains unknown, but publicly available databases (NCBI and TAIR)indicate MITS1 as a putative actin-binding protein, with an 'actinin-type actin-binding domain signature 1' that is similar to a region involved in the actin-binding activity of the chloroplastic actin-binding protein, CHUP1 <ref type="bibr">(Oikawa et al., 2003)</ref>. In addition, several different types of protein domain prediction software revealed that MITS1 contains an AAA-ATPase motif (55-360; SMART, <ref type="bibr">Schultz et al., 1998; Letunic et al., 2006)</ref>, and two leucine zipper patterns (279-300 and 324-345; <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="c6676625dc-software-simple-8">ScanProsite</rs>, <ref type="bibr">(Hulo et al., 2008)</ref>. In contrast with CHUP1, MITS1 is localized to mitochondria. Helical Wheel analysis strongly suggests that the presequence of MITS1 attains a secondary structure with a clustered cationic side that is a known property of mitochondria targeting sequences <ref type="bibr">(Duby et al., 2001)</ref>. The N-terminal part of the mitochondrial pre-sequence is believed to fold into an amphiphilic a-helix both in a phospholipid environment and in vivo <ref type="bibr">(Roise et al., 1988; Lemire et al., 1989)</ref>. Consistent with these observations, the MITS1 mutants with a less defined polar cluster on the side of the helical wheel, compared with the 1-39 peptide, showed a reduced ability to target YFP to mitochondria. Although stability of the a-helix is important for maintenance of mitochondrial import <ref type="bibr">(Hammen et al., 1996; Heard and Weiner, 1998)</ref>, in vivo mutagenesis analysis of a plant presequence from the b-subunit of the F 1 -ATPsynthase from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia showed that the N-terminal helical structure of the pre-sequence is necessary but not sufficient for efficient mitochondrial import, and that its hydrophobic residues play an essential role in in vivo mitochondrial targeting <ref type="bibr">(Duby et al., 2001)</ref>. These findings may explain how peptide 12-39, which maintained a similar cluster of cationic amino acids on the side of the helix in comparison to the full-length pre-sequence, showed targeting to the mitochondria and also to other organelles. It is possible that the distribution of the hydrophobic residues of peptide 12-39 may be altered, resulting in a less efficient targeting signal in comparison to the full-length presequence.:YFP was found in the ER (empty arrow) and Golgi apparatus (arrowhead) as confirmed by the ER/Golgi apparatus marker ERD2:GFP (ER, empty arrow; Golgi apparatus, arrowhead). The mutation of tryptophan 416 to alanine did not affect the distribution of MITS1 to mitochondria (arrow). Insets: magnified section of main panels. Scale bars¼5 lm.</p>

            <p>Background While electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment has been found to ameliorate migraine-like symptoms, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that the brainstem descending pain modulatory system, comprising the periaqueductal grey (PAG), raphe magnus nucleus (RMg), and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), may be involved in migraine pathophysiology. We hypothesised that EA would ameliorate migraine-like symptoms via modulation of this descending system. Methods We used a conscious rat model of migraine induced by repeated electrical stimulation of the dura. Forty male SpragueDawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: an EA group, which received EA at GB20 following dural stimulation; a sham acupuncture (SA) group, which received manual acupuncture at a non-acupuncture point following dural stimulation; a Model group, which received dural stimulation but no acupuncture; and a Control group, which received neither dural stimulation nor acupuncture (electrode implantation only).<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d1fcb47bd8-software-simple-0">HomeCageScan</rs> was used to measure effects on behaviour, and immunofluorescence staining was used to examine neural activation (c-Fos immunoreactivity) in the PAG, RMg, and TNC. Results Compared to the Model group, rats in the EA group showed a significant increase in exploratory, locomotor and eating/drinking behaviour ( p&lt;0.01) and a significant decrease in freezing-like resting and grooming behaviour ( p&lt;0.05). There was a significant increase in the mean number of c-Fos neurons in the PAG, RMg, and TNC in Model versus Control groups ( p&lt;0.001); however, this was significantly attenuated by EA treatment ( p&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences between the SA</p>
            <p>We hypothesised that acupuncture pretreatment would ameliorate migraine-like symptoms in recurrent migraine via modulation of the brainstem descending pain modulatory system: the periaqueductal grey (PAG), raphe magnus nucleus (RMg), and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). To test this hypothesis we chose a rat model of recurrent migraine induced by repeated electrical stimulation of the dura surrounding the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), which is an established paradigm of migraine-associated pain. <ref type="bibr">11 12</ref> The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of EA on behaviour (using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d1fcb47bd8-software-simple-1">HomeCageScan</rs> technology) and neuronal activation in the PAG, RMg, and TNC (by immunofluorescence staining).</p>

Before real/sham electrical dural stimulation, rats were acclimatised for 20 min in an individual transparent acrylic observation cage with an automatic real-time video surveillance and image analysis system, which was lit to model daytime conditions. Subsequently, animals received electrical dural stimulation for 15 min in another cage before being individually placed back into the observation cage for a 1 h recording.</p>

Brains were removed and postfixed overnight at 4°C in 4% PFA/ PBS, then transferred to 30% sucrose/PBS for 72 h for cryopreservation. Coronal sections (25 mm thick) through the PAG, RMg, and TNC were cut using a cryostat (Leica CM3050S, Leica Inc, Wetzlar, Germany), incubated with rabbit anti-c-Fos antiserum (sc-52, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, USA) overnight at 4°C, and then treated with Cy3 goat antirabbit secondary antibodies (111-165-003, 1:500, Jackson</p>

            <p>Sequencing of the recombinant plasmids and the PCR amplification products was performed according to <ref type="bibr">Lata et al. (2010)</ref>.

            <p>About 2 lg of total RNA was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA primed with oligo(dT) in a 20 ll reaction mix using Protoscript M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR was performed using Power SYBER-Green dye (Applied Biosystems) on a step one real-time PCR system of Applied Biosysytems in triplicate. The constitutive actin gene (CAA33874.1) was used as the endogenous control (Actin RT_F, 5#-CTGACGCCGAGGATATCCA-3#; and Actin RT_R, 5#-GCCTTGACCATACCAGTTCCA-3#). The amount of transcript accumulated for the SiDREB2 gene (SiDREB2 RT_F, 5#-GCCTTGTAGTCATTTGTGGTTT-3#; and SiDREB2 RT_R, 5#-CCTCACAACTCCTTTTCTCAAGCT-3#) normalized to the internal control actin was analysed using the 2-DD Ct method <ref type="bibr">(Livak and Schmittgen, 2001)</ref>. The primers used for real-time PCR analysis were designed by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-9">Primer Express</rs> Version <rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-9" resp="#annotator8" type="version">3.0</rs>. The PCR cycling conditions were: initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1 min for 40 cycles, 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 1 min and 95°C for 15 s.</p>
            <p>A core set of 45 foxtail millet accessions, listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, were analysed for SNP discovery by re-sequencing of the SiDREB2 gene. Genomic DNA was extracted as mentioned earlier. The SiDREB2 FL_F/SiDREB2 FL_R primer pair was used to amplify full-length SiDREB2 in all 45 accessions. PCR was performed using Sigma Taq DNA polymerase (1 U) in a 20 ll reaction volume containing ;50 ng of gemonic DNA, 13 PCR buffer (1.5 mM MgCl 2 ), 10 lM of each dNTP, and 10 pmol of each primer. PCR cycling was done as mentioned earlier. Amplified PCR products were precipitated and sequenced in both directions. Sequences were aligned by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-12">ClustalW</rs>.</p>
            <p>Multiple sequence alignment revealed that SiDREB2 has high similarity to DREB proteins from other plants <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S1 available at JXB online)</ref>. Highsequence similarity in the AP2/ERF domain indicated that DREB genes were well conserved among gramineous crops <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. To determine further the relatedness of SiDREB2 to the other AP2/EREBP proteins, a systematic phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on the similarities of AP2 domains in the proteins isolated from Arabidopsis, rice, maize, wheat, sorghum, barley, Festuca, Phyllostachys, tomato, tobacco, cotton, Catharanthus, and Brassica species using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-14">MEGA</rs> <rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-14" resp="#annotator8" type="version">4.0</rs> by the NJ method <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1C)</ref>. SiDREB2 was classified into the A-2 subgroup of the DREB subfamily on the basis of the phylogenetic tree constructed.</p>
            <p>Knowledge of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a protein is a necessary prerequisite for understanding its molecular function. To create a 3D structure of SiDREB2, a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-15">BLAST</rs> search was performed in protein databases for proteins with similar sequence and known 3D structure, but no significant homologous template was found to model the complete sequence. Thus, ab initio modelling of SiDREB2 was done with the help of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-16">I-TASSER</rs> server. In brief, this is a hierarchical protein structure modelling approach based on the secondary structure-enhanced Profile-Profile threading alignment <ref type="bibr">(Zhang, 2008)</ref>. The model structure was validated with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-17">PROSA</rs> (z-score of -5.58) which was in the range of native conformations of other experimentally determined protein structures of the same size <ref type="bibr">(Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007)</ref>. The overall structure has an a-b fold and the DNA-binding domain contained antiparallel b-sheets and an a-helix packed approximately parallel to the b-sheet <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1D)</ref>. This domain, which is highly positively charged,binds the negatively charged DNA double helix. The tertiary structure is stabilized by 224 intramolecular hydrogen bonds as determined by the program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-18">HBPLUS</rs> <ref type="bibr">(McDonald and Thornton, 1994)</ref>. The majority of these hydrogen bonds (44%) are formed by atoms where both the acceptor and donor are from the main chain of the amino acid residues. Only in 25% of the cases are both the acceptor and donor atoms the side chain atoms. The rest (31%) are observed where both main chain and side chain atoms are participating.</p>
            <p>The structure of the AP2 domain of AtERF1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB code 1gcc) was taken as a template for the comparative modelling of the DNA-binding domain of SiDREB2 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1E)</ref> <ref type="bibr">(Allen et al., 1998)</ref>. The sequence alignment between the target and the template is shown in <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S1</ref> at JXB online. In addition, the secondary structure of this domain as predicted by several secondary structure prediction servers (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-18">PHDsec</rs>:<rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-18" resp="#curator" type="url">www.predictprotein.org</rs>/; <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-19">PSIPRED</rs>: <rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-19" resp="#curator" type="url">http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac. uk/psipred</rs>/) is quite similar to the secondary structure of 1gcc <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S1, and Fig. 1E)</ref>. This finding supports the results obtained from several fold recognition servers (<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-20">FUGUE</rs>:<rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-20" resp="#curator" type="url">www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/;fugue</rs>/;<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-21">3DPSSM</rs>: <rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-21" resp="#curator" type="url">www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk</rs>/), suggesting that SiDREB2 has the fold of the DNA-binding domain of the DREB superfamily. Based on the above information, the 'A' subunit of 1gcc was used as a template to predict the 3D structure of SiDREB2 by applying the comparative modelling strategy as described in the Materials and methods. The overall rmsd (root mean square deviation) between the template and the target structure is 0.2 Å . The calculated angle between the b-sheet and a-helices is ;172°. The amino acid residues Arg6, Arg8, Trp10, Glu16, Arg18, Arg25, and Trp27 that are known to make direct contact with the DNA double helix for deciphering the DNA-binding activity are also fully conserved.</p>
            <p>The importance of allele-specific PCR systems for reliable SNP typing has been demonstrated several times in previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Wu et al., 1989; Wei et al., 2006)</ref>. Introduction of additional mismatch bases has improved the specificity of this technique <ref type="bibr">(Drenkard et al., 2000)</ref>. Its application is especially important for an accurate discrimination of different alleles in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-27">MAS</rs>. In the present study, only one pair of ASPs was used to amplify the specific products from the dehydration-tolerant and sensitive accessions. Therefore, the ASM can be effectively used to type SNPs as well as to avoid unambiguous false scoring. The functional differences in trait performance mainly caused by SNPs has also been reported in previous studies on several cloned genes <ref type="bibr">(Peng et al., 1999; Takahashi et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2003; Toshiyuki et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2005; Garcés- Claver et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2009)</ref>. Molecular markerassisted breeding technology is a rapid and accurate method for any candidate gene, providing a very effective tool for backcross breeding <ref type="bibr">(Collard and Mackill, 2008)</ref>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-28">MAS</rs> efficiency is influenced by several complex factors such as recombination between the marker and the candidate gene, a low level of polymorphism between the parents with contrasting traits, and lower resolution of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) due to environmental interactions. In the present study, the ASM is part of the candidate gene, thus eliminating the main disadvantage of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-29">MAS</rs>. However, the ASM developed in this study is a dominant marker, and therefore it cannot distinguish the heterozygotes. The marker has high reliability and efficiency, and the desired PCR product can be identified easily on a simple agarose gel. With the help of this marker, dehydration-tolerant accessions can be selected at a variety of life stages. This is particularly true when the target is the dehydration-tolerant allele in backcross breeding and thus the foxtail millet breeding process can be accelerated. Further, the ASM identified would facilitate allele mining of foxtail millet germplasm resources, thereby leading to identification and utilization of newer alleles in crop improvement.</p>

            <p>The Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles bearing TMZ was prepared using emulsification solvent evaporation method technique reported by <ref type="bibr">Avgoustakis, (2004)</ref>. The various process and formulation variable, i.e., drug concentration, polymer concentration, PVA concentration and sonication time were optimized to get small sized nanoparticles with maximum percent drug entrapment. These variables were optimized by applying 3 <ref type="bibr">4</ref> factorial design using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="bb5a04b446-software-simple-0">Design Expert</rs> Software.</p>
            <p>In this method of optimization, it is difficult to develop an optimized formulation as the method reveals nothing about the interaction among the variables. The independent variable selected were, concentration of drug (A), concentration of PLGA/ PEG-PLGA (B), PVA concentration in aqueous phase (C) and sonication time (D). Hence, a 3 4 factorial design was used with 4 factors (A, B, C and D) at 3 levels and experimental trials were performed at all 82 possible combinations which reveals that onThe main effect of A, B, C and D represents the average result of changing variable at a time from its low level to high level. The interaction terms (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, A 2 , B 2 , C 2 and D 2 ) show how the PDE changes when 2 variables are simultaneously changed. The negative coefficient for all the independent variables (D, AC, BD, A 2 , C 2 and D 2 ) indicate unfavorable effect on the PDE while others are exhibiting positive interaction which indicate favorable effect on the PDE as its concentration in all selected formulation is kept unchanged. Among the four independent variables the lowest coefficient value is for D (−0.36 and p &lt; 0.05) indicating that this variable is insignificant in the prediction of PDE. It is also observed that the PDE does not significantly change (p &lt; 0.05) because as on changing sonication time from 30 sec to 90 sec there is very little decrease in the PDE which shows very less amount of drug loss due to size reduction of the nanoparticles. Similarly, the effect of PVA on the PDE of various nanoparticles was observed and as on increasing the PVA concentration from 0.5 to 1% in nanoparticles the PDE increases significantly while on further increasing PVA concentration of PEGylation of nanoparticles. The PDE (dependent variable) obtained at various levels of 4 independent variables (A, B, C and D). The response surface quadratic models were generated using<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="bb5a04b446-software-simple-1">Expert Design</rs> Software. These were subjected to multiple regression to yield a second order polynomial equations (full model). The correlation coefficient for the models were also calculated which are found to be &gt; 0.94 indicating good fit. The PDE values measured for various batches showed wide variation i.e., ranges from a minimum of 52.89% to a maximum of 77.96% in case of temozolomide bearing Non-PEGylated nanoparticles, while a minimum of 49.62% to a maximum of 75.91% in case temozolomide bearing PEGylated nanoparticles. It is clearly indicated that the PDE is strongly affected by the variables selected for the study. It is observed that as on increasing the concentration of PLGA polymer in the matrix of nanoparticles the percent drug entrapment was found to increased up to the level of medium (i.e., 50 mg) at 5 mg of drug concentration then very little change in PDE was observed which could be due to completely entrapment of the drug into the polymer matrix.is desirable. In our case the Adeq-Precision value is in range of 26-28 which indicates an adequate signal <ref type="table">(Tables 5 and 6</ref>). Particle size. Nanoparticles are formed when specific concentration of PLGA and PVA were mixed together. All the batches of Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles within the experimental design were also evaluated for their particle size. The transformed values for particle size of all the batches (28 each) of Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles bearing temozolomide TMZ along with the results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The results show that formulations no. 10, 19, 20 and 22 from each class of formulations are exhibiting minimum particle size, i.e., &lt; 114 nm for Non-PEGylated nanoparticles, while it is increased about 6 nm more in case of PEGylation of nanoparticles which might be due to the diffusion of the copolymer solubilized in the organic phase leads to an homogenous distribution of the PEG chain on the surface of the droplets and on the surface of the NPs after solvent evaporation. The PS (dependent variable) obtained at various levels of 4 independent variables (A, B, C and D). The response surface quadratic models were generated using Expert Design Software. These were subjected to multiple regression to yield a second order polynomial equations (full model). The correlation coefficient for the models were also calculated which are found to be &gt; 0.96 indicating good fit. The particle size of various nanoparticles formulations showed wide variation i.e., ranges from a minimum of 111.91 nm to a maximum of 120.88 no significant change in PDE was observed in all the cases of nanoparticles formulations. This shows an appropriate concentration of PVA (surfactant 1%) for the better formation of emulsion. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) measures how much the variance of that model coefficient is inflated by the lack of orthogonality in the design and calculated for Non-PEGylated and PEGylated formulations for temozolomide which is found to be near 1 indicating good estimation of the coefficient <ref type="table">(Tables 3 and 4</ref>). Similarly Ri-squared is near to zero which is leading to good model. The model F value calculated in the range of 75.15 to 81.00 which implies the models are significant. The values of Prob &gt; F less than 0.05 are indicating that model terms are significant. In all cases A, B, C, D, AB, A 2 and B 2 are significant model terms. The lack of fit values "F-value" for Non-PEGylated nanoparticles was found to be 61.86, which implies the lack of fit is not significant relative to the pure error and there are only 10-11% chances of large lack of fit "F-value" which could occur due to noise and non-significant lack of fit "F-value" is good fit of model. Similar results were obtained in PEGylated nanoparticles bearing temozolomide where lack of fit "F-value" was found to be 11.44% which is non-significant related to pure error. In both these cases 17-23% chances of large lack of fit "F-value" could occur due to noise. In both cases "Pred R-squared" values are in reasonable agreement with the "Adj R-squared" values. The AdeqPrecision is the measures of the signal to noise ratio. A ratio &gt; 4 <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Design matrix evaluation for response surface quadratic model of non-peGylated nanoparticles bearing temozolomideThe main effect of A, B, C and D represent the average result of changing variable at a time from its low level to high level. The interaction terms (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, A 2 , B 2 , C 2 and D 2 ) show how the particle size changes when 2 variables are simultaneously changed. The negative coefficient for all the independent variables (D, AB, BC, BD, A 2 , B 2 , C 2 and D 2 ) indicate unfavorable effect on the particle size while others are exhibiting positive interaction which indicate favorable effect on the nanoparticles size. Among the 4 independent variable the lowest coefficient value is for D 2 (−0.02 and p &lt; 0.05) indicating that this variable is insignificant in the prediction of PS as the concentration of drug was kept unchanged. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) measures how much the variance of that model coefficient is inflated by the lack of orthogonality in the design and calculated for NonPEGylated and PEGylated formulations which is found to be near 1 indicating good estimation of the coefficient.</p>

Briefly, the primary analysis consists of the following individual operations: (1) Image correction; (2) Global and local background correctton; (3) Feature normalization; (4) Spatial normalization; (5) Global normalization.

            <p>Genomic reads were initially mapped to the reference genome using a fast algorithm. These initial mappings were both expanded and refined by a form of local de novo assembly in all regions of the genome that appeared to contain variations based on these initial mappings. The de novo assembly fully leverages mate-pair information, allowing reads to be recruited into variants with higher sensitivity than genome-wide mapping methods alone typically provide. Assemblies were diploid, and sequencing produced two separate result sequences for each locus in diploid regions. Variants were called by independently comparing each of the diploid assemblies to the reference. The original computational methods for small variant detection are available at: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/ full/10.1089/cmb.2011.0201. These methods have evolved over the development of further <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a9d1eb8edf-software-simple-0">Analysis Pipeline</rs> versions.</p>
            <p>Predicted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were compared using National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) dbSNP version 137 to annotate known SNP information. Each SNP was mapped on the genomic features of the UCSC gene table, such as coding region, untranslational region, and intron. Non-synonymous SNP information was extracted by comparing UCSC reference gene information (http://genome.Ucsc.edu/). Information on cancer-related mutations was obtained from the cosmic cancer information database (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/ cancergenome/projects/cosmic/). The Ingenuity <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a9d1eb8edf-software-2">Molecule Annotation System (MAS)</rs> (<rs corresp="#a9d1eb8edf-software-2" resp="#curator" type="url">http://bioinfo.capitalbio.com/ mas3</rs>/) was used for functional interaction analysis of the genes affected. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a9d1eb8edf-software-simple-3">MAS</rs> is a whole data-mining and function annotation solution used to extract and analyze biological molecule relationships from a public knowledge base of biological molecules and signification.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a9d1eb8edf-software-simple-4">MAS</rs> was used to determine and plot the alterations of genes and signaling pathways. Indeed, two genes in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, EGFR and CACNA1C, were found either mutated or amplified in lung adenocarcinoma tissue <ref type="figure">(Fig S2)</ref> and other cancer-related pathways also harbored multiple mutations <ref type="figure">(Fig S3)</ref>. Activation of the MAPK pathway can result in a multitude of physiological effects, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, mitosis, and the transcription of several classes of genes. EGFR was found in telomerase, cellular aging, and immortality pathways and plays a role in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the regulation of cellular apoptosis <ref type="figure">(Fig 4)</ref>.</p>

The conditions were love (hands caressing), pain (one hand hitting the other), social exclusion (one hand pushing away the other friendly hand), and neutral videos (approaching hand touching the other and getting a non-emotional response). A duplicate of every video was left-right mirrored (<rs corresp="#ce5ae20ce8-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Adobe</rs> <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ce5ae20ce8-software-4">Premiere</rs>) to ensure that hands entered equally often from both sides. Subjects were instructed to watch the videos as if they were watching one of their favourite videos. They were told that a question would be asked later and that they could answer it if they had watched (not memorized) the videos carefully. Two event-related runs ($8 min) consisted of 36 videos (nine instances of each condition), separated by a fixation cross for 8-12 s <ref type="figure">Fig. 1C)</ref>. Subjects' left eye-gaze was recorded by an infrared camera (SMI, iView; 50 Hz).</p>
            <p>Images were analysed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ce5ae20ce8-software-5">SPM5</rs> (<rs corresp="#ce5ae20ce8-software-5" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/ spm/software/spm5</rs>). For each subject, echo planar images were aligned to each other; the T 1 co-registered to the mean echo planar image and normalization parameters (obtained from T 1 segmentation) applied to all echo planar images (3 Â 3 Â 3 mm resolution), followed by smoothing (9 mm Gaussian kernel). Echo planar images were highpass filtered at 300 s. A separate general linear model was used for each experiment.</p>
            <p>(i) We selected studies and meta-analyses that included an experience and an observation condition of actions, sensations or emotions and selected the regions most consistently activated by experience and observation. Whenever possible we then used the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ce5ae20ce8-software-simple-4">Anatomy ToolBox</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Eickhoff et al., 2007)</ref> or the <rs corresp="#ce5ae20ce8-software-7" resp="#curator" type="publisher">AAL</rs> atlas of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ce5ae20ce8-software-7">WFU Pickatlas</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Maldjian et al., 2003)</ref> for regions not yet included in the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ce5ae20ce8-software-simple-7">Anatomy ToolBox</rs> and then combined them into a single composite anatomical region of interest using a logical 'OR' <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2</ref>, blue transparent regions). These anatomical regions, defined using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ce5ae20ce8-software-simple-8">Anatomy ToolBox</rs> included the premotor cortices (Brodmann area 6 in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ce5ae20ce8-software-simple-9">Anatomy ToolBox</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(Gazzola and Keysers, 2009; Caspers et al., 2010)</ref>, the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI = BA3a + b + BA1 + BA2 and SII = OP1 + OP2 + OP3 + OP4) <ref type="bibr">(Keysers et al., 2010)</ref>. Those defined using the AAL included the insula and the anterior/mid cingulate <ref type="bibr">(Wicker et al., 2003; Singer et al., 2004, 2006; Jabbi et al., 2007; Bastiaansen et al., 2009; Lamm et al., 2011)</ref>. (ii) We used the results from our localizer experiment (i.e. experience) to select voxels that were significantly activated by at least one of our stimuli by either one of the groups <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2</ref>, red transparent regions). Eight one-sample random effect t-tests, comparing the four summary volumes (love, pain, neutral, exclusion) of the controls and those of the patients against zero (P unc 5 0.001), were combined by a logical 'OR' (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ce5ae20ce8-software-9">Marsbar</rs>;<rs corresp="#ce5ae20ce8-software-9" resp="#curator" type="url">http://marsbar.sourceforge.net</rs>/) to generate a composite functional region of interest. We combined all hand interactions into a single region of interest, because empathic responses in the viewer are not always equal to the emotion in the actor; seeing pain can trigger tender feelings in addition to, or instead of, pain. Using a composite functional region of interest that included voxels triggered by any of the experiences (love, pain, exclusion or neutral), ensured an inclusive analysis that also captured empathic responses that are not equal to the viewed emotions: tender feelings triggered by a pain video would be captured by such a composite functional region of interest, because similar tender feelings will have been triggered by the love interactions also included in the region of interest definition. The same holds for pain triggered by the sight of exclusion etc. (iii) A logical 'AND' was used to combine the composite functional and anatomical regions of interest <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2</ref>, purple transparent regions) leading to our final region of interest.</p>

Peak identifications were achieved using NIST (Natl.

The LRI values were calculated using a calibration curve generated by injecting a mixture of alkane (C8-C18) under previously described conditions. The percentage peak areas were calculated by dividing the peak area of each compound by the total area. To fairly compare the relative amount of each compound in different treatments, we normalized the peak areas using trans, trans-2,4-nonadienal as the internal standard (IS). The compounds' amounts were normalized by dividing their peak areas by IS peak area.</p>

            <p>For live-cell imaging of yeast strains carrying a plasmid, cells were grown at 25°C in SC media lacking a specific amino acid to select for the presence of a plasmid. For imaging yeast strains carrying a chs2 phosphomutation, cells were first grown in SC-LEU medium to keep them healthy and then washed twice with rich medium YM-1 without carbon source. Cells were then incubated further for 1-3 h at 25°C before being concentrated by centrifugation and spotted on a slab of YM-1 medium containing 2% agarose for live-cell imaging. For live-cell imaging at 37°C <ref type="figure">(Figure 6</ref>), the wild-type and the dbf2-1 dbf20Δ strains were grown in liquid YM-1 media containing 2% raffinose at 25°C to the exponential phase and then shifted to 37°C for additional 3 h. A 2.0-ml culture was then transferred to a 3.5-mm dish coated with polylysine (MatTek, Ashland, MA), which was incubated in the 37°C chamber of the microscope for 20 min to let the cells settle down. A 1.5-ml culture was then removed from the dish, which was followed by the addition of a 1.5-ml prewarmed YM-1 medium containing 2% raffinose, 3% galactose, and 1.5% low-melting agarose. Images were acquired at 25 or 37°C on a spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU 10 scan head combined with an Olympus IX 71 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and an Olympus 100× objective (1.4 numerical aperture, Plan S-Apo oil immersion). Acquisition and hardware were controlled by<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator11" type="software" xml:id="c91bab2cfc-software-0">MetaMorph</rs>, version <rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-0" resp="#annotator11" type="version">7.7</rs> (<rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>, Downingtown, PA). A Hamamatsu ImagEM EMCCD camera (model C9100-13, Bridgewater, NJ) was used for capture. Diode lasers for excitation (488 nm for GFP and 561 nm for mCherry/RFP) were housed in a launch constructed by Spectral Applied Research (Richmond Hill, Canada). Images were taken every minute with z-stacks ranging from 11 × 0.3 to 12 × 0.5 μm. A maximum projection was generated with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c91bab2cfc-software-1">Meta- Morph</rs>, version <rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-1" resp="#annotator11" type="version">7.7</rs>, or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator11" type="software" xml:id="c91bab2cfc-software-2">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-2" resp="#curator" type="version">1.45b</rs>; <rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, MD). For quantification of relative chitin levels in different chs2 phosphomutants <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), the ratio between Calcofluor signal intensity at the bud neck was divided by Chs2-GFP signal intensity at the bud neck.</p>
            <p>For the experiments involving FRAP, cells were grown to exponential phase in SC-HIS media at 23°C. Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 10 ml YM-1 medium and grown for at least another 3 h in a 50-ml flask at 25°C in a water-bath shaker. One milliliter of this culture was taken to concentrate the cells by centrifugation. Cells were then spotted on YM-1 medium containing 2% agarose for FRAP and imaging analysis. FRAP was performed using a Micro Point computer-controlled ablation system (Photonic Instruments, St. Charles, IL) consisting of a nitrogen-pumped dye laser (wavelength, 435 nm) controlled by<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator11" type="software" xml:id="c91bab2cfc-software-simple-11">MetaMorph</rs>. In some cases, sequential photobleaching was applied <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>A, S217D). Images were captured and processed using the same microscope, camera, and software as described earlier. Images were taken every 20 s with a z-stack consisting of 12 × 0.4 μm steps.</p>

            <p>Although technology can target the PWD themselves, the vast majority of telemedicine and smart technologies are designed to support family caregivers. Two separate systematic reviews highlight the benefits of web-based caregiver support programs. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Web-based training and educational programs to support caregivers are readily available. The InternetBased Savvy Caregiver, based on the validated Savvy Caregiver program, <ref type="bibr">30</ref> is an example. It provides an interactive, iterative curriculum that improves knowledge about, and competence for, caregiving. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> A customized computer-telephone integration system, <rs cert="0.4" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f58780be93-software-simple-0">e-care</rs>, provides a psychoeducational intervention that identifies resources and strategies to enhance safety, communication, selfcare, social support, and management of problem behaviors in the community. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> The system features screen phones with hierarchal menus (text and voice) that enables users to 1) place and receive calls, 2) send and retrieve messages, 3) access a range of information and services, and 4) conference with several people simultaneously. This system was effective in decreasing caregiver burden and depression significantly in depression scores in caregivers with high depression scores at baseline. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> Another type of in-home caregiver support links caregivers with expert guidance for managing challenging care situations using video monitoring. Caregivers are trained to capture behaviors that are a problem via computer video recording, which is then wirelessly uploaded for a team of experts to review and provide feedback. In a pilot study, this system demonstrated improved behavior management and caregiver communication and was reported as easy to use. 32 Support for caregivers can also be provided via web-based video conferencing and/or text-based chat forums. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> There is growing use and acceptance of video conferencing in both the diagnosis and monitoring in geriatric medical <ref type="bibr">34</ref> and geriatric psychiatry care. <ref type="bibr">35-37</ref> Though further large-scale studies are needed, research has established the reliability and validity for neurocognitive testing and neurological examinations via video telemedicine. <ref type="bibr">35,37,38</ref> Video conferencing can also link local primary care professionals to specialists for assessments, enhancing the administration of standardized assessments and examinations. <ref type="bibr">35,36</ref> Telehealth diagnosis and monitoring have been welcomed in remote and rural areas and with Spanishspeaking and Native American populations, as access to specialized services is limited in these underserved areas. <ref type="bibr">39,40</ref></p>

The Fisher's exact test was applied for every matching criterion and nonmatching parameters. The survival curves (time to BM and OS) were compared by Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. The incidences of BM within 2 years and the 2-year survival rates were calculated from the survival curves. Factors that are associated with the survival outcomes were explored by univariate analysis. The subsequent multivariate survival analysis was also conducted by Cox regression model</p>

            <p>Calcium imaging. For calcium imaging, a portion of skin was removed within 30 sec after the cautery operation, as described above. After washing the surface by gentle vortexing in PBS, the tissue was soaked in PBS containing Fluo-4 AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) at a final concentration of 10 mM with brief sonication. Fluo-4 AM was allowed to enter the cells for 20 min, and the tissue was then washed in PBS. The tissue was sandwiched by two thin glasses in PBS and observed. The real-time confocal microscope imaging system used in this study was composed of an inverted epifluorescence microscope Eclipse Ti-U (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), a CSU-X1 laserscanning unit with a 520612.5 nm band-pass filter (Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan), and an ImagEM EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan).

The exposure time was set at 100 ms with a 1.0 s interval. Autofluorescence from non-damaged tissues with or without fluo-4 loading and from damaged tissues without loading was found to be minimal or null.</p>

            <p>We approached all practising consultant neurologists (doctors who had completed all neurology training, and were included on the specialist neurology register) in a large NHS region, and sought further recruitment by snowball sampling-participants were asked to nominate a neurologist whose views were different to their own-until the interviews stopped yielding new views (known as thematic saturation) <ref type="bibr">(Ritchie and Lewis, 2003)</ref>. R.K. interviewed the neurologists at a time and place of their choosing, the interview taking between 35 and 70 min. These were 'depth interviews' which employed a topic guide to provide a bare structure, with the material covered adapted to each interview. The subject was 'conversion disorder' and no definition of this was offered by the interviewer. The topics included the neurologist's background, training and current practice, examples of memorable or current patients considered to have 'conversion disorder', the neurologist's definitions, exclusions, models and diagnostic practices. Interviews were digitally audio-recorded and transcribed, and were inductively analysed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="f5ee0aac54-software-0">NVIVO</rs> <rs corresp="#f5ee0aac54-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">7</rs> software. Transcripts were coded by question, and, iteratively, by emerging themes, consistent with an approach known as grounded theory <ref type="bibr">(Glaser and Strauss, 1967)</ref>. The study was approved by the local research ethics committee, and all the participants gave written, informed consent.</p>

The change in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="b295ed8028-software-2">NONMEM</rs> objective functionvalue and goodness-of-fit plots were used to guide the model development. One-and two-compartment disposition models with first-order absorption and first-order elimination were evaluated based on the previous knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of the compound from a single-dose study. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> IIV was assessed on all structural model parameters, as was interoccasion variability (the occasion variable was derived based on the visit number: it was assumed that concentrations measured at different study visits represented distinct occasions). The pharmacokinetic parameters (k a , volumes, and clearances) were assumed to be log-normally distributed around the population mean, but the random effects to describe both IIV and interoccasion variability were assumed to be distributed with a mean of zero. The effects of covariates (age, BMI, creatinine clearance, sex, FEV 1 % predicted at baseline, and weight) on the pharmacokinetic model were investigated once an adequate structural and stochastic model had been finalized. Age was categorized into three groups: 6-11, 12-17, and ≥18 years. Each covariate was tested individually against the key structural model parameters k a , V d /F, and CL/F in a stepwise fashion (forward inclusion). After each step, the strongest covariate relationship was incorporated into the model, and the others sequentially and individually retested, until no further covariates could be added with statistical significance. The inclusion of a covariate term was considered statistically significant if it produced a difference of 3.84 (P = 0.05, given a single degree of freedom) in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="b295ed8028-software-simple-6">NONMEM</rs> objective function value during the forward inclusion and if it produced an objective function value difference of 6.64 (P = 0.01, given a single degree of freedom) during the backward elimination. A combination of proportional and additive error models was used. The visual predictive check was used to provide an assessment of the model's ability to describe the data and the model's suitability for simulation. For the covariates identified after the stepwise process, 1,000 simulations were performed to evaluate their effect on the drug exposure at steady state using the following metrics: C max and C trough . The sensitivity of each metric to a given covariate was evaluated by simulation using different percentile values of the covariate distribution in the pharmacokinetic population, while keeping values of the other identified covariates in the model fixed at their median values in the pharmacokinetic population. These simulations were undertaken using the population parameter estimates from the final model and the IIV values of pharmacokinetic parameters, and they yielded the metrics of interest and their 95% predictive intervals. Further details of the modeling methods can be found in the Supplementary appendix.</p>

During pregnancy and in late childhood, using a combination of questionnaires and interviews, we obtained information about maternal age, race/ ethnicity, education, parity, smoking during pregnancy, marital status, and household income. We collected information from prenatal medical records on serial pregnancy weights and blood pressure readings and infant birth weight and delivery date. Mothers reported their prepregnancy weight and height and the paternal weight and height. We calculated gestational weight gain as the difference between prepregnancy weight and the last clinically recorded weight before delivery. We derived gestational age from the last menstrual period or from the second trimester ultrasound if the two estimates differed by .10 days. Based on U.S. national natality data, we determined sexspecific birth weight for gestational age z scores <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Functional annotation for iRC1080 was performed using a consensus of two separate approaches. In the first approach, gene models (http:// augustus.gobics.de/predictions/chlamydomonas/augustus.u5.aa) from the Augustus update 5 (Au5) of C. reinhardtii genome assembly version JGI v4.0 were functionally annotated by assigning enzyme classification (EC) terms using  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-0">BLASTP</rs> results against UniProt (http:// www.uniprot.org/) and AraCyc (http://www.arabidopsis.org/biocyc/) enzyme protein sequences and their EC annotations as the basis. The second approach followed from mapping of Au5 gene models to annotated JGI v3.1 gene models, for which EC terms and Gene Ontology annotation were assigned using a combination of <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-1">BLASTP</rs>,  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-2">AutoFACT</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-3">InterProScan</rs>, and  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-4">PRIAM</rs>. The comprehensive annotation is presented in Supplementary</p>
            <p>ORF amplicons were generated from C. reinhardtii cells by RT-PCR from RNA or PCR from Gateway clones.

            <p>Quantification of consumed diet. Eggs were harvested from females caught in the field in Okinawa as above, and 5 larvae were randomly chosen and reared at ambient temperature (approximately 27uC), each in a plastic columnar centrifuge tube with an airtight screw cap (10 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height) to prevent leaves from drying. The quantity of leaves eaten by each larva was monitored every day. One piece of leaf removed from the stalk was supplied at a time. Before being given to a larva, the leaf piece was weighed. Additionally, its image was taken by an image scanner, and its area was measured using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="c37baf4c08-software-0">ImageJ</rs> <rs corresp="#c37baf4c08-software-0" resp="#annotator22" type="version">1.44p</rs> software (<rs corresp="#c37baf4c08-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">U.

After being eaten, the remaining leaf was replaced every day with a fresh leaf. The area of the remaining leaf was measured every day, and its value was converted into weight, based on the proportion of the original leaf represented by the remnant. This process ensured that the weight eaten each day was recorded as the weight of the fresh leaf.Cs value, 5.38 (60.06) 3 10 2 , was amended due to a typing error in the original paper <ref type="bibr">15</ref>. The same detector was used to measure cesium activity ( 137 Cs only) in pupae. This well-type detector provides maximum efficiency for small samples, because samples can be inserted into a well. Before measurement, dead pupae were air-dried for several months and placed in a columnar plastic container (14 mm in diameter). The detector was calibrated with a standard prepared from the NBL powder standard (New Brunswick Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne, IL, USA). Measurements were performed until the error rate scored less than 10%. Measurements were assumed to be made simultaneously on 15 February 2014 for simplicity, although several days were required to obtain reliable levels of radioactive signals from the pupae. Radioactivity per pupa at the time of ingestion was calculated, assuming thatMortality and abnormality rates. The mortality rate was defined as the percentage of dead individuals at all stages relative to the total number of individuals reared. Thus, the mortality rate excluded only normal adults. In contrast, the abnormality rate reported here could be more accurately called the total abnormality rate. This rate was the percentage of dead individuals at the larval, prepupal, and pupal stages plus the adults that had morphological abnormalities relative to the total number of individuals reared. Thus, the abnormality rate excluded only normal adults that lacked any morphological abnormalities. Correlation analysis was performed using <rs corresp="#c37baf4c08-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c37baf4c08-software-1">Excel</rs> (<rs corresp="#c37baf4c08-software-1" resp="#annotator22" type="version">2013</rs>) and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="c37baf4c08-software-2">JSTAT</rs> <rs corresp="#c37baf4c08-software-2" resp="#annotator22" type="version">13.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#c37baf4c08-software-2" resp="#annotator22" type="version">2012</rs>) (Yokohama, Japan).</p>
            <p>Mathematical modeling. We first used the built-in mathematical fit function of <rs corresp="#c37baf4c08-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c37baf4c08-software-3">Excel</rs> (<rs corresp="#c37baf4c08-software-3" resp="#annotator22" type="version">2013</rs>) to obtain the best-fit curves among available models. All possible models were examined including linear, exponential, logarithmic, polynomial, and power function models, and the best possible fit in terms of R 2 values and biological justification was considered to be the most appropriate. Based on equations obtained in this way, we manually calculated the half lethal dose and the half abnormal dose by setting y 5 50(%). Additionally, linear and nonlinear models were examined using the model analysis software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="c37baf4c08-software-4">JMP</rs> <rs corresp="#c37baf4c08-software-4" resp="#annotator22" type="version">11.0.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#c37baf4c08-software-4" resp="#annotator22" type="version">2013</rs>) (<rs corresp="#c37baf4c08-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC, USA). We reasoned that the simplest mathematical equation with the highest R 2 value, the lowest RMSE, or the lowest information criterion, such as AIC, BIC, and MDL, would be accepted. We examined linear models (including logarithmic scales for power function) and nonlinear models (including logarithmic, square root, quadratic, polynomial, logistic, and exponential equations). Among the model fits performed, logistic 4 P models also showed high R 2 values (R 2 5 0.9972 and BIC 5 19.93 for mortality rate; R 2 5 0.9997 and BIC 5 12.31 for abnormality rate) in addition to the power function models, but the complicated equations with relatively high BIC values discouraged the use of these equations for further analysis.</p>

            <p>The first part allows students to reproduce the nuclear medicine seminars, the films used, and useful references and links are provided. In the second part of interested students can participate in a voluntary online-POL seminar and deepen their knowledge. The first part allows students to revise the nuclear medicine seminars by providing the slides, sources and further references. In the second part interested students can participate in a voluntary online POL seminar and deepen their knowledge. This part of the offer was -because it is teaching project -deliberately designed to be passive; except for a forum and feedback tools there are no plans for interactive teaching at this level. The concept plans that moodle pages accompanying the seminar draw attention to the "active offer" (the POL area) and serve as a "lure". Therefore, the method of problem-oriented learning is described at the bottom of the page and the first POL case is made available on this page. Students interested in working on this POL case in a virtual seminar are asked to register by email to receive more information. Once there are at least 4 people interested in working on a POL case, a small group is formed. To conduct a virtual POL seminar, some basic technical knowledge or preparation is required from each participant. Due to the costs, a deliberate decision was made not to use virtual classrooms or a similar platforms. In our context the online communication software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-1">Skype</rs> (<rs corresp="#dd3c46cc39-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// www.skype.com</rs>) and the word processing application <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-2">Google Docs</rs> (<rs corresp="#dd3c46cc39-software-2" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.google.com/google-d-s/intl/de/ tour1.html</rs>) were used. Both programs available free of charge and are already used by many people in everyday life. While <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-simple-4">Skype</rs> provides the basis for the online meetings with conference calls, the application <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-simple-5">Google Docs</rs> has the advantage that a multitude of documents can be edited by different people, simultaneously or one-at-atime, so simple synchronous and asynchronous online collaboration is possible. For this purpose the tutors create an account and provide login information for the students. The case process is inspired by the classic POL principle, which means the starting point for the students is a real case study from nuclear medicine. To date, three cases have been completed dealing with thyroid diagnosis, oncological positron emission tomography (PET) and myocardial scintigraphy. As an example, the POL module "Energised" on thyroid diagnosis and treatment, including the background information for students and tutors, the intended learning goals and guidelines for online presentation is shown in the appendix . The case is worked upon -following the classical POL model <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> -in seven steps, which are carried virtually for the most part (online): The steps to clarify basic questions of understanding, defining the problem, the collection of ideas and approaches, the systematic ordering of ideas and approaches are made online in a <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-simple-6">Skype</rs> conference call under the moderation of a tutor (a specialist in nuclear medicine or a medical physics expert, each with at least 5 years of teaching experience but without dedicated training), which ends in the formulation of learning objectives. Subsequently, students work on their own or in groups to develop the learning content and compile the results in a document (text or slides). In this phase, slated to last up to three weeks maximum, the tutor is available by email or by telephone on weekdays to answer questions and problems and responds to questions/comments within 24 hours. Finally, the synthesis and discussion of the group results on the basis of the documents takes place online as well. A feedback session concludes the case discussion.</p>
            <p>The educational project "Molecular Imaging"" was conducted in summer 2008 for the first time. It was found that the "passive" part of the offer was well received in the last four semesters. A total of 539 students used the slides for revising the seminars. The "active part", which expects a lot of participation from the students, was viewed by 21 students from the 2 nd (n=11), 3 rd (n=8) and 5 th clinical semester (n=2) in five POL groups of 4-5 students each. Except for two students all participants have completed the relevant course. Both drop-outs indicated that the course was too effort-intensive and one student complained that the technical conditions are inadequate. The technical difficulties consisted of initial problems with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-simple-7">Skype</rs> conference, causing the start of the first POLevent to be delayed by 30 minutes. Amongst the other 19 participants, the seminars became a very active forum in which the students became increasingly independent. This was reflected, among other things, in the activity of the tutor who only had to intervene in one seminar on myocardial scintigraphy when the group wanted to place its main focus on coronary angiography rather than put nuclear medical diagnostics. Otherwise, the tutor essentially only had to carry out moderating duties. Working through the cases on average took 6 to 7 weeks and in respect to the intended learning goal, the factual results were positive. Due to the (so far) relatively small number of participants, no valid comparison between the "classic face-to-face POL seminars" can be made. From the perspective of the tutors it can be said, however, that both the results of the students' work and the subsequent discussion were at a very high level. The virtual POL seminar had the character of a teaching project, so far with only relatively few participants. Accordingly, our evaluation interest was not only quantitative but also qualitative. The starting point of this approach was the social scientific criticism of the quantitative survey with questionnaires, which allow mathematisation of the results presentation and reproducibility but with results that often remain superficial due to the suppression of factors or that may produce a false picture <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. In the context of a complex teaching-learning situation a of lack of proximity to the problem and a lack of practical relevance can be the result. With a qualitative survey, however, we chose an open results approach, which highlights the teaching-learning situation in its inner argumentative and practical structure. This is important because the views of the relevant stakeholders will be reflected systematically. Against this background, the evaluation of the course was carried out both in a feedback session at the end of the course and via a brief online questionnaire (moodle), in which students graded four aspects of the course (from 1 "very good" to 6 "bad fail"). 17 of the 21 students evaluated the event (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) and gave mostly positive assessments. It is striking that the technical implementation of the course, especially the first POL groups, received the worst assessment which can also be ascribed to initial problems of the tutors. In the feedback session all participants stated that they benefited from the seminar. A virtual seminar was uncharted territory for most participants and this is reflected in statements that the format of the seminar takes some getting used to. There was also consensus that a restriction of communication to the linguistic level is difficult because the nonverbal element is important, particularly in group work. It is therefore not surprising that four of the five small groups met in face-to-face during the working stage to discuss the case. From the perspective of teachers and the clinic too, the seminar was instructive, even labour intensive compared to the classical "chalk and talk" approach, with an average of 11 hours (6 hours in total in the online phase, 3 hours for evaluating the results and feedback to students and 2 hours for tutoring support).</p>

            <p>Categorical variables were reported as percentages and compared by χ 2 test, whereas continuous variables were reported as means and SDs and compared by analysis of variance, if normally distributed, or by the Kruskal-Wallis test, if not. Temporal trends were tested using the Cochran-Armitage test for binary variables and the Kendall Tau rank correlation coefficient with the Jonckheere-Terpstra test for continuous variables. The 95% CIs of the difference of percentage changes were evaluated using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a954843cac-software-simple-0">R package proCIs</rs>. Since the baseline patient characteristics showed significant changes in the five registries, we calculated a risk score for the 2010 MANTRA population using a logistic regression model resulting statistically significant at univariate analysis or considered of clinical interest. These variables included gender, age, diabetes, history of heart failure, prior stroke/transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), peripheral vascular disease, prior renal failure, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, Killip class and atrial fibrillation at admission. This score, evaluated on the 2010 MANTRA population, was also used to standardise the death rates for each of the previous surveys. The standardised death rates therefore represent the rates that would have been expected if the distribution of the baseline characteristics of each of the first four surveys had been similar to that of the most recent one.</p>

            <p>The models were built using three different approaches: 1. Tree-based predictive models i. Decision trees (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-0">Cubist</rs>) ii. Random forests (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-1">randomForest</rs>) 2. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-2">monmlp</rs>) 3. Symbolic regression (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-3">rgp</rs>).</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-4">Cubist</rs> is a tree-based modeling approach wherein a linear model is fit iteratively, resulting in a set of linear models at each node starting from the root to the last node of the tree. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-5">Cubist</rs> is an ensemble-based technique. All variables that are covered by a linear function at a single node are then discarded from the future iterations for that particular tree. This process is recursively continued until all the input variables have been covered by a single or a set of rules in a tree. This is also known as the separate-and-conquer approach. At every step, the response of the model is analyzed and adjusted to be used by the next model, until the final model is achieved. The final prediction is a simple average of the predictions from each tree in the ensemble. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> random forest</p>
            <p>Random forests are well known tree-based models. One model is shaped by numerous trees in the collection. Independent trees are generated based on sample data randomly taken out of the training data set. Errors exhibited by individual trees are collectively representative of the generalization error of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-6">randomForest</rs> model. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> An extensive search for the best architecture was carried out using a 10cv scheme, followed by training of the best-performing architecture on the full data set.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-7">Monmlp</rs> is the implementation of ANN in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-8">R</rs>. ANNs with<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-9">monmlp</rs> are generalized feed-forward ANNs that work in a monotone fashion using the backpropagation (BP) algorithm</p>
            <p>Khalid et al enhanced by the nonlinear minimization algorithm (nlm) for training. Neural networks imitate the structure of the human brain, whereby information is passed on between neurons in the form of synapses. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-10">Monmlp</rs> allows two hidden layers of neurons, with hyperbolic tangent and linear activation as transfer functions. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> In <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-11">monmlp</rs>, signals move forward from the input layer through sigmoid neurons before reaching the linear output layer.</p>
            <p>Moreover, different activation functions, such as hyperbolic tangent sigmoid (TAN-SIG) transfer function, logarithm sigmoid (LOGSIG) transfer function, and pure linear (PURELIN) transfer function, are the potential transfer functions that can be used in each layer. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> The neural network package <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-12">monmlp</rs> was run extensively to find the bestperforming network architecture with 10cv. The whole data set was used to retrain the model on the best architecture.</p>
            <p>Genetic programming (GP) is a bioinspired algorithm based on evolution principles to solve complex problems. A complex problem is broken down into smaller, simpler problems with random solutions. These solutions are then evolved through the biologically mimicked process of variation and selection until the end condition is reached or a workable solution is generated. Thus, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-13">rgp</rs> is an implementation of GP methods in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-14">R</rs> environment. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-15">rgp</rs> results are simple representations of the problem without being exposed to a priori information. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-16">rgp</rs> offers various options for initialization, variation, and selection procedures inherent in GP. GP implements a tree structure representation to show the mathematical equations. The tree structure is composed of two parts: function set (nodes) and a terminal set (leaves). <ref type="bibr">30</ref> The function set can be chosen through the operators {+, -, *, /, sin, cos, log, abs}, mathematical functions, conditional statements, or even the user-defined operators. In addition, the terminal set includes constants and model variables. <ref type="bibr">31,32</ref> To find the best solution, different runs were conducted by iterating over GP tuning parameters. The most important tuning parameters are maximum size of the chromosome, the number of generations, and population size. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> The size of the chromosome, which governs the maximum length of the equation, was varied from 5 to 100. The population size was set to 1,000, and the number of generations was set to 500 million evolution steps divided into 100 stages.</p>
            <p>These equations can be optimized by different strategies. <ref type="bibr">33,34</ref> For this experiment, equations were created on the whole data set, and then selected ones were optimized using the simulated annealing (SANN) algorithm, followed by a quasiNewton (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno [BFGS]) method. <ref type="bibr">35,36</ref> independent feature selection by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-17">fscaret</rs></p>
            <p>The package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-18">fscaret</rs> allows semiautomatic feature selection, working as a wrapper for the caret package in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-19">R</rs>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-20">Fscaret</rs> is specialized for in silico feature selection experiments, whereby approximately 120 different packages are used to fit models. <ref type="bibr">37</ref> Input feature ranking is extracted from trained models by using weighted averages. Sum of squared errors (SSE), mean squared errors (MSEs), and RMSEs are used to evaluate models. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-21">fscaret</rs> has been successfully implemented in recent studies. <ref type="bibr">38,39</ref></p>
            <p>Data from additional tableting experiments was used to test the trained models. Tablets were made with MCC. The external data set was particularly challenging for the models because roll compaction conditions were kept constant in the training data set while being systematically changed in the external data set. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the results of external validation. The models were able to predict porosity with substantial accuracy using unseen input data. The external data set is composed of experiments with two different roll compactor tooling (cheek plates and rim rolls) and two different roll compaction forces <ref type="figure">(4 kN and 8 kN)</ref> for each. The variety of roll compactor settings introduces variance in the external data set unknown to the trained models. Although CI systems are not known for their extrapolation abilities, <ref type="bibr">42</ref> the models presented herein are able to extrapolate successfully in a small range. Regardless of the complexity in the external data set, the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-22">rgp</rs> model represented by <ref type="bibr">Equation 4</ref> makes accurate predictions of the test cases from all different tooling and force conditions <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>). <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the levels of accuracy of prediction for the external validation data set. Non-roll-compacted powder is predicted with the most accuracy (NRMSE: 7%), followed by prediction of roll compaction using rim rolls at 4 kN (NRMSE: 9%).</p>
            <p>Further RSM analysis based on the GP equation shows that variation in the amount of MCC does not have a profound effect on the porosity of the tablet, while an increase in the die compaction force considerably reduces the porosity of tablets <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>), a behavior that can be attributed to particle rearrangement followed by plastic deformation during the compression stage. <ref type="bibr">44</ref> Feature selection on the external data set to establish the surplus of discarded variables Plausible performance of the trained CI models on a significantly different external data set could be an occurrence of chance. To study this in detail, important features from both the data sets were compared. Feature selection experiments using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-23">fscaret</rs> were run independently on the external data set. Confirmatory models were developed with a variation of input vectors using the tree-based learning method <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-24">Cubist</rs>. The resulting top features of the external data set are in agreement with the features used to train the models. The results confirm that the die compaction force is the most important variable, with roll compaction force, roll compaction tooling,percentage of material in the formulation, and granule fraction range displaying much lower ranking. Models developed without the information of roll compaction force, roll compaction tooling, and granule fraction range predict porosity of tablets accurately <ref type="table">(Table 5</ref>: experiments with two and three inputs). The successful modeling shows that these variables do not contribute to the outcome within this design space. The results strongly suggest redundancies in the original data set, which, once removed, do not affect the prediction of porosity within the factor space. Correlation analysis of the original data set reveals that porosity is highly correlated to die compaction force <ref type="figure">(Figure 7)</ref>.a nrMse and R 2 are presented. all experiments were done in 10cv mode of data representation. Mlr and decision trees were implemented in r using lm command and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-25">cubist</rs> package, respectively. Abbreviations: 10cv, tenfold cross-validation; Mlr, multiple linear regression; nrMse, normalized root-mean-square error.</p>

In order to enable the evaluation, the initially documented ADRs were coded numerically according to the system organ classes (SOCs) of the MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) terminology, and the specific symptom. Also, corresponding causality categories were entered numerically. For every documented ADR and week, a single data set containing patient details, medication, daily dosage and causality category for every given AED was generated. Where the same ADR was documented more than once for one patient, the first documented observation and accordingly the one with the lowest AED dosages was included for analysis only. For patients without ADRs, the highest AED dosage was considered. To rule out possible input errors, the data were entered twice at different times.

Subjective image ratings for each image were compared using the Friedman test. Dunn's multiplecomparisons test was used as the post-hoc test. The Korean J Radiol 16(5), Sep/Oct 2015 kjronline.org pairwise comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon test corrected for multiple comparisons according to the Bonferroni adjustment. The diagnostic accuracy of each pulse sequence for the detection of focal hepatic lesions was determined using an alternative free-response receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on a lesion-bylesion basis. Considering the possible influence of lesion clustering on the diagnostic accuracy, nonparameric analysis of clustered ROC curve data was performed by using the method proposed by Obuchowski <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. The sensitivity for each set of images was evaluated according to the number of lesions assigned confidence levels of 3 or 4 from among the 86 liver lesions. We used our own method (21) for comparing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. A p value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. The kappa statistic for two observers was calculated to assess the inter-observer agreement regarding pairwise comparison between T2WIs. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarises the results of consensus review for motion artefact; anatomic sharpness of organs margin; and conspicuity of intrahepatic vessels, hilar bile duct, and main lesion for the three different T2WI sequences.

            <p>In this study, twenty-five patients candidate for elective or emergent open bone fixation of the forearm, carpus and/or hand referred to Hazrat Rasul Hospital, Tehran, Iran, were recruited. The operation should be performed in 90 minutes. Exclusion criteria were patients' refusal to undergo the experiment, history of allergy to local anesthetics, presence of severe heart disease, severe hypotension, seizure, drug addiction, psychiatric diseases, use of antidepressants or anxiolytics, multiple trauma or other organs' involvement and underlying disease in which tourniquet application is contraindicated (such as the Raymond's disease and sickle cell disease or trait). The study received ethics committee approval from Iran University of Medical Sciences. All participants were informed about the type and method of anesthesia and pain measurement individually by the anesthesiologist and written informed consent was obtained from them. To overcome some of traditional method's disadvantages, two changes were made as: 1) The IV cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein; 2) an elastic band was firmly wrapped around the proximal forearm distal to the cannulation site. Lidocaine 0.5% (at least 4 mg/kg totally in 50 mL) <ref type="bibr">(1, 3, 4)</ref> was carefully administered via the IV cannula in less than 90 seconds. The forearm was held perpendicular to the elbow, above the local anesthetic injection site, for five minutes. Then it was fastened with the elastic band distal to the cannulation site to keep the anesthetic agent in the proximal arm and prevent its distal spread. Tourniquet pressure and other details were the same as the traditional method. If pain was present at the tourniquet site, the distal tourniquet would be first inflated and the proximal one deflated. At the end of operation, the tourniquet was totally deflated. The pain was measured and recorded based on the standard verbal descriptive scale of 0-5 scores, presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>. Data including pain at surgical site before the operation, five minutes after the block, every five minutes during the operation, before and after tourniquet entire deflation and then every ten minutes until one hour after the tourniquet deflation were recorded. For each patient pain at the tourniquet site was measured at ten minutes intervals separately after inflating the proximal tourniquet, after inflating the distal tourniquet and after deflating the proximal one throughout the operation. Anatomic site of upper extremity bone undergoing the operation was lower forearm and hand, distal radius or ulna, carpus, metacarpus and phalanges. The type of bone surgery consisted of drilling in association with applying pins, plates and screws. The operation length was individually recorded for each patient. Prior to the operation, an 18-gauge intravenous cannula was inserted on the contra lateral limb for fluid administration. Shortly after the cannula insertion, 1 µg/kg fentanyl and 0.015 µg/kg midazolam were administered for all patients. The tourniquet was carefully deflated following bone fixation to obtain surgical site hemostasis. Considering the side effects of local anesthetic toxicity, patients were evaluated during the operation as well as the first hour of operation <ref type="bibr">(1, 4, 9)</ref>. All patients with mild pain (&lt; 1 on the pain score) following tourniquet deflation received an extra dose of fentanyl (1-1.5 µg/kg). The protocol was to induce general anesthesia if intolerable pain was experienced or if the operation took longer than 90 minutes. Throughout the first 24 hours of the operation, the site of operation was checked for thrombophlebitis, Volkmann ischemic paralysis and cellulitis every four hours and every 12 hours during the next 48 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e5dbee7212-software-0">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#e5dbee7212-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">13</rs> for windows.

            <p>The database integrates the sequence information of the RNAi reagents with phenotypic information based on genome-scale and genome-wide published RNAi screens. It contains 90 998 RNAi probes that have been designed by various groups. These include libraries used in Heidelberg and Boston <ref type="bibr">(4,14)</ref>, by groups in San Francisco and others <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>. Using the sequence information, all RNAi constructs were computationally mapped onto the latest genomic sequence using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e10d796729-software-simple-0">BLAST</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e10d796729-software-simple-1">MUMmer</rs> <ref type="bibr">(16,17)</ref> and gene and isoform annotations were derived through the mapping process. All probe information is visualized using an implementation of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator24" type="software" xml:id="e10d796729-software-simple-2">Generic Genome Browser</rs> (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e10d796729-software-simple-3">GBrowse</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Additional information was added to describe the specificity of dsRNAs. To this end, we have generated all possible 19mer sequences of annotated gene models (in total &gt;40 Mio.) and identified homologous sequences in the complete genome. These are annotated as 'tracks' in<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e10d796729-software-simple-4">GBrowse</rs> and allow evaluation of the specificity of RNAi probe sequences. In addition, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e10d796729-software-simple-5">GBrowse</rs> tracks are included that show other types of non-specific regions, such as low complexity and repetitive elements in the gene model which should be avoided in the design of RNAi probes. Phenotypes mapping to such elements should also be treated with caution until further confirmatory data is available. Furthermore, for every single 19mer sequence we have calculated an RNAi efficiency score <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref> which is shown as a 'RNAi efficiency' column in the database. The average predicted efficiency is shown for individual RNAi probes from various libraries as well as a 'track' for complete gene models in the<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e10d796729-software-simple-6">GBrowse</rs> interface. Specificity and efficiency information can also be used to guide the design of new RNAi probes for follow-up experiments.</p>
            <p>The database can be accessed through various routes. Individual gene entries can be directly accessed via a linkout ('Heidelberg RNAi') from Flybase <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. From the entry webpage of the database, user can search by gene identifier, by RNAi probe ID (if known) or by phenotype <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). For all these search options more detailed web pages are available which offer advanced input options (e.g. sequence homology search). Through the 'phenotype' entry page a complete list of all phenotypes can be requested by clicking the 'Display list of all phenotypes' link. This can then be used to access an individual gene or probe list. A second way to search for phenotypes and RNAi probe information is by sequence similarity. In the 'Gene' or 'Probe' menu page, the user can enter a Drosophila (or heterologous) nucleotide or protein sequence which is mapped by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e10d796729-software-simple-7">BLAST</rs> against the BDGP transcript file or probe files. This allows for example to search for phenotypes of a homolog of human cdc2 or can be used to find all RNAi probes from various libraries that overlap with a query sequence.</p>
            <p>Information with respect to genes or RNAi probes is subsequently retrieved from the database. In case of gene query, the database retrieves all mapped RNAi probes and displays them as a table <ref type="figure">(Figure 2A)</ref>, including information of phenotypes that were reported, the calculated target transcripts and whether all isoforms are targeted (columns 'Transcripts' and 'Specificity'). This view shows also how many in silico diced siRNAs map to gene model and whether additional transcripts are targeted (column 'Other Targets') by the dsRNA. The database allows then to drill down and retrieve more detailed information, including primer and amplicon sequences <ref type="figure">(Figure 2B</ref>) by following the 'RNAi probe' link as well as more detailed information on other targets by following the corresponding link. The completeness of available RNAi constructs in their genomic context is summarized in an interactive <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e10d796729-software-simple-8">GBrowse</rs> implementation, which shows the gene model, the RNAi probes of all available libraries and tracks that allow evaluating the efficiency and specificity of probe sequences <ref type="figure">(Figure 2C)</ref>. Other <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e10d796729-software-simple-9">GBrowse</rs> functions can then be used to extract for example non-targeted regions, common exons, regions with high specificity or regions of lowcomplexity. Information can be extracted as text or XML files.</p>
            <p>An example of a database session is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. In this case, the user searched for RNAi probes that target CG6210 (FBgn0036141), a factor required for the secretion of Wg/Wnt ligands <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>A shows that multiple RNAi probes are available in different libraries and also links to FlyBase, if more information on CG6210 is requested. When the user selects the HFA10605 RNAi probe, the database shows more detailed information, such as primer sequences used to amplify a template for in vitro transcription, the length and sequence of the amplicon. This page also shows all other phenotypes that were observed with this RNAi probe, allowing evaluation of the specificity of the RNAi experiment. When selecting the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e10d796729-software-simple-10">GBrowse</rs> image, the user can locate other RNAi probes in relation to the gene model; for example, whereas for CG6210 six dsRNAs from different libraries have a similar location, a single dsRNA ('AMC-Amplicon') targets only one splice variant (CG6210-RA) and might give only a partial phenotype. These assignments are even more complex for gene models that have a larger number of splice variants and/or overlapping transcripts.</p>

            <p>To investigate the effect of DA-9801 on NGF regulation, we first tested the effect of samples on the induction of NGF <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Effects of DA-9801 on NGF regulation. To determine the effect of DA-9801 on NGF production, rat primary astrocytes were treated with various concentrations of DA-9801. After 24 h, (A) NGF content in the medium was measured using a rat βNGF assay kit. (B) NGF mRNA expression was confirmed via reverse transcription PCR after 2 h of DA-9801 treatment. Also, we measured (C) NGF levels in the sciatic nerves and (D) the plasma of DA-9801-treated db/db mice. To investigate the NGF-mimetic activity of DA-9801, we treated PC12 cells with 125 μg/ml of DA-9801. The neurite outgrowth per cell was observed every other day, and (E) images were taken of randomly selected fields using a camera attached to a microscope at 4 days. (F) The neurite length was determined using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="fb8259bead-software-0">Optimas</rs> <rs corresp="#fb8259bead-software-0" resp="#annotator17" type="version">6.5</rs> program (<rs corresp="#fb8259bead-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Media Cybernetics</rs>, MD, USA). The differentiation of PC12 cells was scored as follows: cells without neurite outgrowth (0); cells bearing neurites as long as one cell diameter (1); cells bearing neurites two times longer in length than their diameter (2); and cells that had synapse-like neurites (4). (G) We also detected Tieg1/Klf10 mRNA by reverse transcription PCR after 6 h of DA-9801 treatment. In this study, 50 ng/ml NGF was used as a positive control. (A) and (F) were expressed as mean ± S.D. and ***p&lt;0.001 indicate statistically significant differences from the control group (Student's t-test). (C) and (D) were expressed as mean ± S.E.M. Statistical comparisons between different groups were performed using a one-way ANOVA test followed byin primary astrocytes isolated from cerebral cortices of neonatal rats. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>A, treatment with DA-9801 significantly increased NGF secretion. The contents of NGF in the medium were 31.7 ± 5.8 pg/ml in control cells and 319.6 ± 2.3 and 609.4 ± 57.1 pg/ml in DA-9801-treated cells (100 and 200 mg/ml), respectively. Moreover, DA-9801 increased NGF mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in rat primary astrocytes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. We also measured NGF levels in the sciatic nerves and the plasma of db/db mice treated with DA-9801. Our results showed that NGF levels in the sciatic nerves were increased by oral administration of DA-9801. The NGF content was 6.2 ± 0.5 pg/ml in control mice. However, the DA-9801-treated mice secreted 9.9 ± 0.3 pg/ml (DA-9801 30 mg/kg) and 11.6 ± 1.0 pg/ml of NGF (DA-9801 100 mg/kg), respectively <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2C)</ref>. In the plasma of db/db mice, NGF concentration was also increased by treatment with DA-9801 100 mg/kg <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2D)</ref>. In both the sciatic nerves and the plasma of db/db mice, LA and GABA had no influence on NGF induction. We also evaluated NGF-mimetic activities of DA-9801 using PC12 cells, which respond to NGF by flattening their cell bodies and extending neurite-like processes <ref type="bibr">(Traverse et al., 1992)</ref>. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>E and F, we confirmed increases in the neurite length after treatment with DA-9801. The response of PC12 cells treated with DA-9801 (125 mg/ml) was similar to that of the cells treated with NGF (50 ng/ml). We also assessed Tieg1/Klf10 mRNA levels in PC12 cells after treatment with DA-9801 for 6 h. Tieg1/Klf10 is an NGF target gene via the TrkA signaling pathway in PC12 cells <ref type="bibr">(Spittau et al., 2010)</ref>. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>G, DA-9801 increased Tieg1/Klf10 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner.</p>

            <p>According to the definition, the in-air output factor (Sc) can be written as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.2; which numerator and denominator are chamber readings (R) for the same number of monitor units (M) in the presence of a build-up cap for a field with dimensions L and L0 (as a reference field e.g. 10×10cm 2 ) at SSD=100cm and collimator opening CL, C0 respectively. For the total scatter factor, measuring at the dmax in water phantom for a specific field (L) to that reference field (L0) for the same number of monitor units (M) <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>, it would be written as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.3. To prevent electron contamination of the photon beam, it is recommended that all readings are performed at a depth of d=10 cm and then they are transmitted to the maximum depth using PDD (d) for that field size <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. So, the formula in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.4. According to <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>., L, L0 (field size), CL, and C0 (collimator opening) are shown as AB, EF, , and respectively. As can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the total scatter factor is obtained by dividing the dosimeter reading which is caused by primary and secondary radiation (S') from two volume VABCD and reference volume VEFGH and then correct for depth d to dmax. The Sp is defined as the ratio of the absorbed dose at the dmax in phantom (water or solid water) Page 3525 for a given field to that in the reference field with the same collimator opening (C0) to eliminate the collimator effect <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Therefore, the formula in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.5. In this study, to maintain the collimator opening for all fields, the phantom surface can be pulled up (for L&lt;L0) or down (for L&gt;L0) <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). For example, for a field smaller than L0, L=AB, it is necessary to pull up phantom surface to J=(L/L0) ×SSD to achieve the same collimator opening. However, care must be which the dosimeter reading at J' needs to be corrected for SSD changes using Mayneord Factor. Therefore; we have to perform dosimetry in several SSDs and the main problem is phantom surface collision with Linac head for small fields. On the other hand, according to Eq. 3 and 5, the difference between the Sp and the total scatter factor is the amount of the collimator opening. Therefore, by considering a correction factor (for the effect of collimator) in the total scatter factor (Eq. 4), Sp can be achieved (Eq.5) as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.6. In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> with regards to the Pythagorean theorem, the trapezoid ABC"D" and A'B'C'D' are equal; therefore, the Sp is obtained by dividing the dosimeter readings at S' form two volume VA'B'C"D" and reference volume VEFGH. In this method, we propose to apply a factor (α) to correct scatter portion reached to the dosimeter (S') from VABCD to VABC"D". As mentioned in previous studies <ref type="bibr">(15, 16)</ref>, suppose that there is a parallel beam striking the surface of the phantom and consider a reference plane normal to the central axis, placed at depth d=10cm which the origin is on the central axis. Hence, each element (dx.dy) on this plane acts as a source of scattered radiation. The amount of scatter radiation reaching the central axis (dosimeter location, S') is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between surface elements and the origin. Therefore, with taking into account the photon attenuation µ, α is defined as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.7; Where µ is energy attenuation coefficient which depends on energy, field size and depth <ref type="bibr">(17, 18)</ref>. Therefore, the formula in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.8. α will be greater or lesser than 1 while phantom surface was pulled up or down respectively. Let us eliminate the small area at the origin of the coordinate with radius ε (refers to the ion chamber radius =3mm) to overcome singularity in nominator and denominator in Eq.7 and use polar system <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>. Therefore, the scatter contribution to dosimeter location (S') for a rectangular field with dimensions (2Y × 2X) <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>) is calculated as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.9. Finally, a general computer program using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e47e4e7c89-software-0">MATLAB</rs> <rs corresp="#e47e4e7c89-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">7.12.0</rs> software was written to calculate α using the numerical method to solve Eq. 9.</p>

            <p>PCC assay employed in the present study is a modified technique described by Puig et al <ref type="bibr">10)</ref>. The peripheral blood lymphocytes were incubated for 2 h at 37 before and after irradiation for repair. Ficoll Histopaque density gradient method was used to separate lymphocytes from whole blood cells. Blood lymphocyte cultures were set up with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FCS and 0.2 ml of PHA (final concentration of 20 μg/ml) and incubated 37 for 48 h. One hour before harvesting i.e., after 47 h of incubation, cultures were centrifuged, culture volume was adjusted to 2.5 cm 3 , and Calyculin A (50 nM) or Okadaic acid (500 nM) was added to the culture. After about 1 h of incubation with the drug, cultures were harvested and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 8 min to get a firm pellet with a clear supernatant. Supernatant was discarded and a pellet was disturbed and mixed thoroughly using a vertex. Pre-warmed (37 ) hypotonic solution (0.075 M KCl) was added to the pellet with constant vortex mixing. The pellets in the hypotonic solution were incubated at 37 for 6 min in a pre-warmed water bath and then centrifuged at 900 rpm for 8 min. The cells were fixed by cold fixative solution with 1: 3 mixtures of acetic acid and methanol after removing the supernatant and gentle agitation. To prepare the chromosome spread on slides, the cells were mixed thoroughly and dropped on a precleaned frozen slide from a certain height (~30 cm) followed by quick warm and air blow on the slide surface to get better spread of metaphase chromosomes. The slides were stained using giemsa stain for 10 to 12 min by dipping in staining solution and washing 3 to 4 times with a d.d.w. The slides were mounted with a cover slip using Deepex before scoring. PCC spreads were analyzed at 100X magnification with an Olympus BX 51 fluorescent microscope coupled to a Jenoptik C5 cooled CCD camera with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a74562d5ad-software-0">ProgRes Capture Pro</rs> <rs corresp="#a74562d5ad-software-0" resp="#annotator8" type="version">2.8</rs> software. 100rings per dose were scored. Two scoring criteria were used; one as suggested by Kanda et al. <ref type="bibr">4 )</ref>, which includes all spherical shaped PCC rings, and another suggested by Lamadrid et al. <ref type="bibr">18)</ref>, which strictly limits ring evaluation to those which clearly defined open space. Extra fragments were recorded as those exceeding 46 pieces in G2/M PCC cells and 92 pieces in case of M/A PCC cells. For each ring, one fragment was not considered as extra fragment. For curve fitting, the minimum Chi-square method using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a74562d5ad-software-simple-2">Origin</rs> package was used. The distribution of PCC rings were analyzed by Papworth's u test <ref type="bibr">19 )</ref>. The detailed statistical analysis is given elsewhere <ref type="bibr">20 )</ref>.

            <p>Apoptosis was detected by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) using the fluorescein-dUTP-in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). For TUNEL assay, cells were seeded on microscope cover glasses pre-coated with 0.1% poly-D-lysine [prepared in 100 mM Na 2 B 4 O 7 .10(H 2 O) buffer at pH 8.2], and cultured over-night in the HG-medium. After confirming attachment of cells to the cover slips, medium was changed to LG-medium for over-night starvation. Glucose was added to the starved cells at different concentrations and for different time periods, after which TUNEL was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and then washed in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate on ice, washed twice with PBS and incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 • C in a humidified atmosphere in the dark. Slides were washed twice with PBS, stained with DAPI for nuclei detection, and washed again with PBS. The cover glasses with cells were flapped on glass slides covered with a few drops of mounting media (DakoCytomation), photographed using an upright fluorescence microscope (Axioscop 2, ZEISS), and processed by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="c324bcb6a5-software-simple-0">Image Pro</rs> software.</p>
            <p>Apoptosis was also detected by PARP cleavage from 116 kDa into 89 kDa fragments using western blot analysis. Since PARP is a nuclear protein, we decided to test its cleavage in nuclear extracts and not in whole-cell extracts to prevent dilution. Nuclear extracts were prepared and collected as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Schreiber et al., 1989)</ref>. Proteins were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 1 h, and subsequently probed with a primary monoclonal antibody: anti-PARP (SeroTec, UK) that detects the full length as well as the cleaved PARP. HRP-conjugated Donkey-anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., USA) was used as secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent-ECL (prepared locally) and visualized by autoradiography. AChE expression was also detected using western blot analysis. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared <ref type="bibr">(Schreiber et al., 1989)</ref>, and separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described above. A rabbit anti-human polyclonal AChE antibody, which detects all isoforms of AChE, was used (sc-11409, diluted 1:500 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA). A mouse monoclonal antibody anti-α-Tubulin (T6199, diluted 1:4000 from Sigma-aldrich, USA) was used for normalizing cytoplasmic protein loading.

The semi-structured interview schedule was employed flexibly and was also grounded in that it was adapted as the study progressed. A preliminary analysis on the first 12 patient interviews was undertaken by the first author (G.D.-W.), who also conducted the interviews. Subsequently, the conceptual framework was expanded in discussion with all the authors of this article. Although the original aim was to describe patient experiences relating to investigation and management of their ataxia, it rapidly became evident as the baseline interviews progressed that most people's contact with health services ended when diagnostic investigations were completed, whether or not an underlying aetiology was found. Accordingly, diagnosis became a focus in the interviews and in the analysis. This article focuses especially on the follow-up data as these experiences are likely to better reflect the current situation for users in services, as opposed to their own historical experiences of health services, which in some cases stretched back several decades. In the results to follow, interview extracts are labelled using two or three fields showing the participant ID, quotation number and (in baseline interviews only) line numbers from the interview transcript (e.g. P14: 6: 74-78 or P37: 12).</p>

            <p>binding. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Through modulating the stability of the LDI via mutations, they eliminated the possibility of maturation protein being mostly synthesised by the equilibrated cloverleaf conformation. <ref type="bibr">7,8</ref> Secondly, they directly assessed the kinetic model via adjusting the co-transcriptional time delayed for the LDI formation, and concluded that this duration is positively correlated with the yield of maturation protein. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Moreover, computational simulation of the co-transcriptional folding trajectory using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fdcb3e5eaa-software-simple-0">KINWALKER</rs> does predict both the transient kinetic trap and the cloverleaf structure. <ref type="bibr">51</ref> Mutational analysis also provides evidence supporting the functional importance of this metastable hairpin -the kinetic trap for this kinetic model -for the translation of maturation protein. Mutants with the metastable hairpin disrupted produce no plaque whereas compensatory double mutation is able to rescue the fitness of the phage. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> On the other hand, mutation stabilising the metastable structure via replacing the bulge by a base pair increases the translation of maturation. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Furthermore, bulk evolution of those mutants with no metastable hairpin eventually leads to the restoration of the metastable hairpin. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Taken together, they imply the necessity of the metastable hairpin for the synthesis of maturation protein and thus the infection fitness of the phage.</p>
            <p>Self-cleavage-permissive structure is an upstream hairpin The permissive structure for the self-cleavage of the HDV ribozyme is mapped to the nt ¡54/-18 of the RNA transcript using the secondary-structure prediction program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fdcb3e5eaa-software-simple-1">MFOLD</rs>. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> This structure sequesters the inhibitory stretch of nt ¡24/-15 from Alt1 in a hairpin P(-1) located upstream of the cleavage site. <ref type="bibr">12,81,82</ref> This extended RNA transcript is demonstrated experimentally to cleave cotranscriptionally.</p>
            <p>Firstly, structural mapping via ribonuclease was used to probe the nt ¡54/-1 fragment instead of the whole precursor transcript due to the fast-cleaving nature of this structure, which reveals a local hairpin P(-1) pairing nt ¡54/¡40 with ¡18/-30. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> This structure is consistent with the ss-count values calculated <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Arc-plot of Tryptophan operon leader made using the visualisation program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fdcb3e5eaa-software-simple-2">R-CHIE</rs> <ref type="bibr">[96]</ref>. The left legend specifies the percentage of canonical base-pairs in the paired alignment columns, i.e. those connected by an arc. The right legend specifies the evolutionary support (e.g., covariation, etc.) for each position in the alignment. The alignment and arcs at the top show the information for the terminator structure, whereas the bottom ones correspond to the anti-terminator structure for the same underlying alignment. The lines in each alignment correspond to the respective sequences with every box representing either a nucleotide or a gap in the respective sequence. Every arc represents a base-pair involving the respective two alignment columns. The arcs are colour-coded according to their percentage of canonical base pairs, whereas the evolutionary information supporting each base pair is encoded in the colouring of the underlying nucleotides in the base paired alignment columns, see the right legend for details. Two green blocks connected by an arc implies that this is a canonical base pair (i.e., GC, AU or GU) which corresponds to the most abundant type of base pair for this pair of alignment columns. Cyan means this is a canonical base pair but that it has an one-sided mutation with respect to the most abundant (green) base-pair. Blue refers to a canonical base-pair which differs on both sides from the most abundant (green) base-pair. Red means this is a non-canonical base pair. Unpaired nucleotides are shown in black and gaps in grey.</p>

            <p>We summarize the key features of our alignments in <ref type="table">Tables 1 and 2</ref>. A small multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from a previous project published by us <ref type="bibr">14</ref> was used to build a primary covariance model (CM) using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fdcb3e5eaa-software-simple-4">INFERNAL</rs> program <ref type="bibr">92</ref> to search the full alignments in RFAM 1 and the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fdcb3e5eaa-software-simple-5">NCBI TAXONOMY BROWSER</rs>. <ref type="bibr">93</ref> In our previous research, <ref type="bibr">14</ref> these small MSA were compiled using evolutionarily related sequences for these four RNA families, respectively. These small MSAs are of a high-quality with positive covariation and few gaps, making them convenient starting points to build the corresponding primary CMs. For each of our four alignments, we aligned the sequences of the seed alignment in RFAM with the primary CM first and then curated this against all experimentally verified structures which were first mapped to a reference sequence. We then build a secondary CM incorporating sequences from the RFAM seed alignment which we used to align the hits returned by the searchwith the primary CM. These hits were clustered to reduce primary sequence redundancy, choosing a representative sequence for each cluster based on structural fit and covariation. Hits passing this selection strategy were retained only if they contained all alternative structures. We then calculated quality measures for the resulting hits to determine which ones to add to the existing small MSA. The resulting alignment was then curated recursively according to the aligning results returned by<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fdcb3e5eaa-software-simple-6">INFERNAL</rs> using the secondary CM for each of the alternative structures.</p>
            <p>Primary covariation model: Initial Small Alignment A primary covariation model (cm) is constructed using a small good-quality alignment assembled previously by our group; <ref type="bibr">14</ref> repeat the CM compilation (i.e., build and calibrate in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fdcb3e5eaa-software-17">INFERNAL</rs>-<rs corresp="#fdcb3e5eaa-software-17" resp="#annotator3" type="version">1.1RC2</rs>) for each of the alternative structures. If the structure contains pseudo-knots, it must be split into non-pseudo-knotted substructures in order to process it in INFER-NAL; if possible, compatible helices of such non-pseudo-knotted substructures and the remaining alternative structures are combined into one structure so as to simplify the subsequent curation (e.g., in HDV, a non-pseudo-knotted substructure of the active conformation is added to the alt2 structure). The aforementioned preassembled alignments of Trp operon leader, Levivirus, HDV and SAM riboswitch have 10, 7, 10 and 15 sequences, respectively.</p>
            <p>Secondary covariation model: preassembled alignment + unique RFAM seed alignment sequences Firstly, the primary CM is used to align the sequences from the RFAM seed alignment (or only part of it, e.g., the alternative structures of HDV are only valid for the genomic sequences, so only genomic sequences are aligned here). This aligning procedure is repeated for the primary CM built from each of the alternative structures. Secondly, redundant sequences are removed from this expanded alignment (i.e., sequence from pre-assembled alignment + RFAM seed alignment), which is subsequently manually curated to optimise the covariation for all alternative structures. Curation is initiated on the alignment generated by the CM with the structure with the largest number of base pairs, and the other alternative structural features are mapped onto the same alignment. During curation, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fdcb3e5eaa-software-simple-9">RALEE</rs> <ref type="bibr">94</ref> is used to visually compare the resultant alignments generated by the covariation models pertaining to each alternative structure, and structural overlapping regions are identified and then manually curated (section 4.1 (iv) of Supplementary Material). Thirdly, a secondary CM is thus built and calibrated based on this expanded alignment.</p>
            <p>Expanded Alignment: select sequences to add into the original small MSA Overlapped hits Firstly, the primary CM for each alternative structure is used to search the RFAM full alignment via <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fdcb3e5eaa-software-simple-10">INFERNAL</rs> (alternatively, for Levivirus, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fdcb3e5eaa-software-simple-11">NCBI TAXONOMY BROWSER</rs> is used by downloading the branch of the tree of life in which this non-coding RNA resides; for SAM riboswitch, we start our curation from an alignment provided by <ref type="bibr">Winkler et al. (2003)</ref> 11 and the SAMbound structure is also annotated by them). A sequence is retained only if the searches using the CM of each individual alternative structure all return this sequence as a hit, and if this sequence spans the full length of all the CM without truncated ends. A hit is defined as a candidate sequence that yields log-odds score greater than 0 in the search result. Secondly, the secondary CM is used to align the overlapped hits; repeat the aligning step for all secondary CM corresponding to each of the alternative structures. Since the alignment constructing the secondary CM is optimised for all alternative structures, aligning the hits using the secondary CM facilitates the following curation among all alternative structures.</p>
            <p>Cluster the aligned overlapped hits In order to reduce the sequence redundancy and increase the diversity, the alignment sequences comprised of the overlapped hits are clustered based on primary sequence conservation via<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fdcb3e5eaa-software-simple-12">USEARCH</rs>; <ref type="bibr">95</ref> different percentage identity cutoffs are tested to obtain around 50 to 100 clusters. For each alternative structure, a best-fit sequence is chosen for each cluster using home-made scripts scoring the covariation. Best-fit sequences overlapped among all of the structures are identified as common hits. These common hits are then ranked and filtered based on the fit of the sequence to a structure and the extent of insertions relative to the reference sequence, which gives rise to a MSA for each structure.</p>

Cases with previous surgery of the ipsilateral hip, avascular necrosis, rheumatoid arthritis or other rheumatic diseases, tumors, history of hip disease in childhood or adolescence and peripheral vascular disease have been excluded. No patient was using platelet aggregation inhibitors, coumarin derivate or was subjected to heparin prior to surgery. Anesthesia of patients was performed with lumbar spinal block, using heavy bupivacaine 20 mg and 0.1 mg morphine. Patients were placed in contralateral lateral position to perform a posterior-lateral approach. After opening the fascia lata and muscle and repair of tendons of the external rotator muscles of the hip, articular exposure with the opening of the posterior capsule was performed. The posterior hip dislocation with maximum flexion and internal rotation exposes the femoral head for visualization of the four quadrants (anterior, posterior, superior and inferior). <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>) After completion of the exposure of the joint surface, a puncture was performed in the middle of each quadrant with a 3.2 mm drill with a 10 mm depth lock.

            <p>Staphylococcus aureus was cultured overnight at 37°C in BHI media, after which the culture was diluted 1:10 with the same media. This diluted solution (100 μl) was spread onto plates and incubated at 37°C for 6 h, followed by 6 h of cooling at 20°C. For treatment with heat-killed pathogens, plates were incubated at 65°C for 6 h to kill the pathogen. Worms were transferred to prepared media (previously seeded with heatkilled or live pathogens) and the live worms were counted every 6 h until no living worms remained.

Moreover, in C. elegans, increased ROS levels were shown to occur in the intestine at the site of pathogen infection <ref type="bibr">(Chavez et al., 2007)</ref>. Because UCP-4 is involved in regulating mitochondrial membrane potential (ψ m ), we investigated the function of UCP-4 in the response to pathogens. First, we compared ψ m using TMRE staining in wild types and in ucp-4 mutants upon exposure to either live (pathogenic) or heat-killed (non-pathogenic) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). As seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, the ucp-4 mutant had high ψ m compared to that of the wild type without pathogen exposure (Figs. 4A and 4C, respectively). After pathogen exposure, there was no significant change in ψ m between live and heat-killed pathogen exposed ucp-4 mutants <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4D)</ref>. In contrast, wild type worms showed an increase in ψ m upon exposure to live pathogens <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4B)</ref>. This increased ψ m could be related to pathogen resistance; we therefore assayed worm survival. We placed animals on pathogen-seeded plates during each developmental stage, specifically egg, L1-2, L3-4, and adult day 1, 5, and 10. After the worms were transferred, surviving animals were counted each day until all were dead. We used the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="d39a0e7d68-software-4">OASIS</rs> program to calculate mean survival days based on the raw data <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2011)</ref>. As seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>E, the ucp-4 mutant survived longer than the wild type when exposed to the pathogen at the egg stage, L1-2, L3-4, and the young adult stage (day 1). However, exposure at the aged adult stages (days 5 and 10) produced different results. Specifically, the ucp-4 mutants were more susceptible to the pathogen compared to wild type at this stage.</p>

            <p>Biomarkers for gastric cancer diagnostics PGI/PGII ratios in the serum or plasma are indicators of atrophic gastritis, which is linked to elevated risk of gastric cancer. <ref type="bibr">12-15</ref> H. pylori and gastric atrophy have both been identified as etiological factors for gastric cancer. H. pylori was declared as a class I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1994. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Epidemiological surveys support a positive association between H. pylori infection and the development of gastric cancer. <ref type="bibr">17-19</ref> In this study, all patients and health controls had been tested for H. pylori IgG with ELISA kit (Biohit ELISA kit; Biohit, Helsinki, Finland). Intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and hemoglobin were also associated with gastric cancer development and metastasis in previous studies. <ref type="bibr">20-26</ref> All antibodies have been validated in ELISA and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antigen protein has been validated for ELISA too. We developed all kits for Luminex according to The Luminex Cookbook. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> All nine protein kits were divided into a 5-plex panel and two 2-plex panels with different dilution rates for each patients' samples. All samples were randomly divided into different plates to perform the Luminex test.

            <p>A panel consisting of 25 microsatellite markers was selected for the diversity analysis of Tibetan sheep population. These were chosen from literature related with sheep diversity studies aiming to analyze highly polymorphic markers spread across the genome. These markers also adhere to the guidelines of International Society for Animal Genetics and FAO (http://dad.fao.org/en/refer/library/guidelin/marker.pdf). Detailed information on primers is presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Forward primer of each marker was 5′ labeled with fluorescent dye, i.e. FAM, NED, PET and VIC. PCR amplification was performed in a reaction volume of 25 μl on i-cycler. Reaction mixture consisted of 50-100 ng of genomic DNA, 200 μM of each dNTP, 50 pM of each primer and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The amplification was carried out using a Touchdown program for all microsatellite loci, which consists of initial denaturation of 95°C for 1 min; 3 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 60°C for 1 min, 3 cycle of 95°C for 45 s and 57°C for 1 min; 3 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 54°C for 1 min, 3 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 51°C for 1 min and 20 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 48°C for 1 min. The PCR amplification was confirmed by electrophoresing the products in 1.8% agarose gel followed by staining with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml). PCR products were multiplexed <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref> and genotyping was carried out on an automated ABI-3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA) using LIZ 500 as the internal size standard (Applied Biosystems, USA).

            <p>The locations of radiographic fi ndings were recorded according to the 3 acetabular zones described by Charnley and to the 7 femoral zones described by Gruen. Osteolysis was defi ned as a non-linear lucency of 3 mm or more around the prosthesis <ref type="bibr">(Claus et al. 2003)</ref>. Loosening of an acetabular component was determined from evidence of migration and a radiolucent line <ref type="bibr">(Hodgkinson et al. 1988, Johnston et al. 1990</ref>). An acetabular component was diagnosed as "loose" when it had migrated more than 4 mm in either the horizontal or the vertical direction, or if it had tilted by more than 5°. Cemented acetabular components that had continuous radiolucent lines with any thickness in all 3 zones were categorized as being loose. Uncemented acetabular components that had radiolucent lines wider than 2 mm in all 3 zones were categorized as being loose. Loosening of an uncemented stem was defi ned by whether the stem was considered to be unstable according to the criteria of <ref type="bibr">Engh et al. (1990)</ref>. Loosening of a cemented stem was defi ned by whether we found a continuous radiolucent line around the stem, or stem subsidence of &gt; 5 mm. Bone defects were assessed using Paprosky's classifi cations <ref type="bibr">(Paprosky et al. 1994, Della Valle and Paprosky 2004)</ref>. Bone areas with reduced density in the acetabulum and proximal femur were recorded as "atrophy" <ref type="bibr">(Wangen et al. 2008)</ref>. Thinning of the femoral cortex adjacent to a well-fi xed stem was recorded as "cortical atrophy" <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). Heterotopic ossifi cation was defi ned using the classifi cation of <ref type="bibr">Brooker et al. (1973)</ref>. In 3 hips, the proximal femur was replaced with a tumor prosthesis, so we evaluated the acetabular component only. In 1 hip, all the implants had been removed, so we assessed bone defects only. Leg-length discrepancy (LLD) was assessed by comparing the heights of greater or lesser trochanters relative to the line connecting the teardrops of the acetabulum. If the deformity was severe or if the proximal femur was replaced with a tumor prosthesis, we did not evaluate the patient's LLD. For analysis radiographs, we used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="dac2aee1c2-software-1">Mdesk Orthopaedics</rs> software (<rs corresp="#dac2aee1c2-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">RSA Biomedical</rs>, Umeå, Sweden).</p>

            <p>Exons and at least 50 nucleotides into the flanking intron sequences of AMT (GenBank NM_000481.2, NP_000472.2; <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d2211e3b11-software-simple-0">Ensembl</rs> ENSG00000145020) and GLDC (GenBank NM_000170.2, NP_000161.2; <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d2211e3b11-software-simple-1">Ensembl</rs> ENSG00000178445) were sequenced. Phase was established from parental samples. Deletions and duplications in GLDC were analyzed by either multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, <ref type="bibr">10</ref> or by a targeted array-based comparative genomic hybridization utilizing a customized 60k oligonucleotide microarray with a positive threshold of 3 consecutive probes allowing the detection of 300bp deletions, and verified by dual real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Taqman probes. Sequence variants were compared with 6 other species, and conservation was recorded. Splice site mutations were analyzed in silico using the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="d2211e3b11-software-simple-2">BDGP Splice Site Prediction</rs> by Neural Network program, <ref type="bibr">21</ref> and for select patients by analysis of mRNA in EBV transformed lymphoblasts. To evaluate the effect on splicing of a deep intronic mutation in AMT (Patient 75), the generated cDNA was sequenced in 2 overlapping fragments. To evaluate whether the maternal mutation c.2203-2A&gt;G; IVS18-2A&gt;G (Patient 310) created a leaky splicing error, we evaluated for the presence of normally spliced mRNA not containing the paternal mutation c.547delG in the mRNA of the patient and mother by digestion of the cDNA with NcoI followed by agarose electrophoresis, where the paternal mutation abolishes a restriction site.</p>
            <p>The impact of each mutation on residual enzyme activity was systematically evaluated. Exonic deletions, nonsense mutations, and frameshift mutations were categorized as having no residual activity, except for a frameshift mutation that affected the final 20 amino acids. Splice site mutations affecting the 2 conserved donor or acceptor nucleotides and predicted in silico as likely affecting splicing were considered to leave no residual activity. For missense mutations in GLDC, the impact on residual P-protein activity was assessed by expression in vitro in COS cells and measuring the residual enzyme activity on a glycine exchange assay modified by the use of purified human recombinant lipoylated H-protein. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Missense mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into a full-length GLDC cDNA in the pCMV6-Entry vector (RC211292; Origine, Rockville, MD), and with mock and wild-type GLDC included in each experiment, were transfected into COS7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were harvested after 48 hours, and P-protein activity was measured by the glycine exchange assay containing excess lipoylated, recombinant human H-protein. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Activities were normalized by protein concentration measured by the Bradford method <ref type="bibr">23</ref> and mutant enzyme activity expressed as percentage of concurrent wild-type enzyme activity determined in the same experiment. Transfection efficiency was monitored by quantitative PCR for GLDC cDNA content. To generate recombinant, lipoylated human H-protein, GCSH cDNA PCR amplified from a human liver cDNA library was cloned as a thioredoxin fusion protein into the pBAD-DEST 49 vector (Life Technologies), expressed in bacteria, and purified from the cell lysate by boiling for 1 minute followed by chromatography on a diethylaminoethyl cellulose column. Lipoate-protein ligase (LplA) from Escherichia coli was expressed, purified, and used to lipoylate purified human H-protein as described using a molar ratio of 0.5:1.0 LplA:H-protein. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Lipoylation was confirmed by Western blotting (ab97625; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and by mass spectrometry. The N-terminal thioredoxin tag was removed from the lipoylated H-protein by enterokinase digestion (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), and reaction products were separated using a Q Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare BioSciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Following transfection in COS cells, steady state Pprotein levels were identified by Western blotting following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using an antibody against the P-protein from Abcam (ab97625), with b-actin as a loading control. Coexpression studies used cotransfection with vectors containing both mutants compared to transfection with a single mutation and an empty vector. A model of human P-protein encoded by the GLDC gene was created using the homology modeling program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="d2211e3b11-software-simple-3">ESyPred3D</rs> based on the crystal structure of holo glycine decarboxylase from Synechocystis (Protein Data Bank ID: 4LHC). <ref type="bibr">25,26</ref> The relative locations of mutated residues in the 3-dimensional model were viewed using the program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="d2211e3b11-software-1">RasTop</rs> <rs corresp="#d2211e3b11-software-1" resp="#annotator6" type="version">2.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#d2211e3b11-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.genein- finity.org/rastop</rs>/).</p>
            <p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. The difference between severe and attenuated variables is evaluated by Student t test for variables that have normal distribution, and by Mann-Whitney U test for variables that are not normally distributed as evaluated with Wilk-Shapiro. Subcategories of attenuated NKH were evaluated by 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The significance of a difference in proportion is calculated by the chi-square test. Pearson and Spearman correlation tests were conducted to identify the correlation between outcomes and predictors, and identify colinearity among the predictors according to the data distribution. Multiple linear regression was performed to model the DQ in relation to predictors. Multiple ordinal logistic regression was performed to model the relationship between predictors and disease severity or AEDs. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="d2211e3b11-software-4">SPSS</rs> Statistics package version <rs corresp="#d2211e3b11-software-4" resp="#annotator6" type="version">21</rs> (<rs corresp="#d2211e3b11-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">IBM</rs>, Armonk, NY) and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="d2211e3b11-software-5">SAS</rs> version <rs corresp="#d2211e3b11-software-5" resp="#annotator6" type="version">9.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#d2211e3b11-software-5" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS</rs>, Cary, NC) were used to perform the analyses. A p value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Severe brain malformations (corpus callosum agenesis or cerebellar cyst with hydrocephalus) only occurred in patients with severe NKH or in neonatal death. Thus, 3 features related to clinical severity-developmental delay, number of AED, and brain malformation-interrelated as a class. We next examined clinical predictors of these severity classes.</p>

            <p>Biases in the rates at which duplications form in different genomic regions or a greater propensity for selection to favor duplications in specific functional classes can result in a bias in gene ontology (GO) categories among duplicated genes. We used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="bce7e2df2f-software-simple-0">DAVID GO</rs> analysis software to identify overrepresented functions among duplicate genes in D. yakuba and D. simulans. In D. yakuba, we observe 678 duplicated genes with orthologs in D. melanogaster. Overrepresented functional categories include immunoglobulins, extracellular matrix, chitins and aminoglycans, immune response and wound healing, drug and hormone metabolism, chorion development, chemosensory response and development, and morphogenesis <ref type="table">(supplementary table S</ref> <ref type="bibr">(Wong and Wolfner 2012)</ref> and immune response to pathogens <ref type="bibr">(Lazarro and Clark 2012)</ref> are known for their rapid evolution, and therefore these genes are strong candidates to search for evidence of ongoing selective sweeps. Though mutational biases can produce similarities in GO categories, the overabundance of toxin metabolism genes and immune response peptides in both species as well as the overrepresentation of chemoreceptors, chitin cuticle genes, and oogenesis factors suggests that duplications are likely key players in rapidly evolving systems.</p>
            <p>) with the following parameters, bwa aln Àl 13 Àm 50000000 ÀR 5000. The resulting paired-end mappings were resolved via the "sampe" module of bwa (bwa sampe Àa 5000 ÀN 5000 Àn 500), and the output was sorted and converted into a "bam" file using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="bce7e2df2f-software-2">samtools</rs> version <rs corresp="#bce7e2df2f-software-2" resp="#annotator3" type="version">0.1.18</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Li et al. 2009</ref>). In the alignment and resolution commands, Àl is the hash sized used for seeding alignments, and the ÀR, Àa, ÀN, and Àn refer to how many alignments are recorded for reads mapping to multiple locations in the reference. After the paired-end mapping resolution, the bam files from each lane of sequencing were merged into a single bam file sorted according to position along the reference genome. A second bam file, sorted by read name, was then created for use as input into our clustering software.</p>

Functional data for D. yakuba and D. simulans are not readily available in many cases, and thus we identified functional classes in the D. melanogaster orthologs as classified in Flybase.

This means that the docked ligand must form a coordinated interaction with the heme iron ion from the IDO active site. For the docking, the A chain of 2d0t, which was crystallized as a dimer, was used. The original ligand 4-phenyl-imidazole, the two co-crystallized detergent molecules of 2-[ N -cyclohexylamino]ethane sulfonic acid, and water were removed. The binding site of the original ligand was chosen for the docking. The program defines the open space in the binding pocket with so called alpha spheres that represent available atom positions. Placement was done by the triangle matcher algorithm using standard settings. The triangle matcher algorithm generates poses by aligning triplets of ligand atoms with triplets of alpha spheres to find possible binding orientations of the ligand within the binding site.</p>

From these data, response rates and response latency were calculated. Overall and weekly response rates were calculated as the percentage of texts to which an adolescent responded. For Weeks 1 and 6, adolescents were supposed to text their blood glucose levels three times per day (morning, afternoon, and evening); thus, the denominator in the Week 1 and Week 6 equations was 21 (3 times per day × 7 days). For Weeks 2-5, adolescents were supposed to respond to two texts per day (morning and either afternoon or evening); thus, the denominator in the equations for Weeks 2-5 was 14 (2 times per day × 7 days).

            <p>Sequences for 4 shRNA were designed to target the 39 untranslated region of genes, and 2 of them were selected (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> <ref type="bibr">1</ref> were cultured without feeder cells in standard media. After expansion, these cells were co-transfected with 1.6 mg of shRNA expression vector and cultured with puromycin starting at 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. We selected 72 h time point as a trade-off between two objectives: (a) to capture early responses of target genes and minimize indirect responses, and (b) to observe robust changes in gene expression. The early time point (48 h) was not chosen due to relatively weak responses: only 111 genes changed their expression by .5-fold, as compared to 256 and 579 genes at 72 h and 96 h, respectively. The late time point (96 h) was not chosen, because it may include the response of many non-target genes that are affected indirectly. In particular, almost 1/2 of genes (48.3%) that changed their expression by .2-fold at 96 h did not respond at earlier time points <ref type="figure">(Supplementary Figure 1)</ref>. The proportion of GFP-positive cells in culture, measured by flow cytometry, was high enough (.74% for all shRNA) to justify using all cells for gene expression profiling. We chose not to use sorted cells because sorting often results in cell damage followed by the induction of stress-related genes. RNA was extracted with Trizol TM (Invitrogen). Efficiency of knockdown was quantified by real time qPCR, microarrays and Western blot <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1c, d)</ref>; primers and antibodies are listed in Supplementary Tables 6, 7. Gene expression was profiled with NIA Mouse 44 K Microarray v3.0, Agilent Technologies, #015087 <ref type="bibr">23</ref>. The data was batchnormalization for compatibility of experiments. Microarray data are submitted to GEO/NCBI (GSE26520). Two shRNA were used for the majority of TFs and we treated them as biological replications using ANOVA. Some of these experiments included also 2 technical replications where cells were split after transfection cultured separately and RNA was hybridized to separate microarrays. Further details on cell manipulation and data analysis can be found in the project website: http://esbank.nia.nih.gov/. For statistical analysis we used <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="e6156a1acf-software-simple-0">NIA Array Analysis</rs>, which estimates the False Discovery Rate (FDR) to account for multiple hypothesis testing <ref type="bibr">24</ref>. All genes shown as significant in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> and Supplementary Table S2 satisfy stringent statistical criteria (FDR , 0.05, fold change .2). Response of genes to the knockdown of TFs was measured as a logratio (i.e., difference between mean log-transformed expression in the knockdown experiment and global median expression). Principal component analysis (PCA) of log-transformed gene expression was done using genes that showed statistically significant change in their expression (FDR , 0.05) with SVD method applied to the covariance matrix of log-transformed gene expression values within the <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="e6156a1acf-software-simple-1">NIA Array Analysis</rs>.</p>
            <p>For the heatmap <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5b)</ref>, we selected 2046 named genes (excluding olfactory receptors and Riken clones) with .1.5 fold median change following the knockdown of Pou5f1 and Sox2 (trajectory 1) or knockdown of Esrrb, Sall4, Nanog, and Tcfap4 (trajectory 2). These genes were then classified into 6 response groups as follows: if the logratio of gene expression change was .2 fold greater following one trajectory that another trajectory, then the gene was considered specific to the former trajectory. A small number of genes (N 5 18) responded in opposite directions following trajectories 1 and 2. We classified them according to the strongest absolute value of the median logratio of gene expression change. Within each group, genes were sorted using hierarchical clustering, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="e6156a1acf-software-2">TMEV</rs>, ver <rs corresp="#e6156a1acf-software-2" resp="#annotator8" type="version">3.1</rs> <ref type="bibr">27</ref>.</p>

            <p>For incident abdominal obesity cases, the time of abdominal obesity occurrence was assumed to be the midpoint between the visit at which abdominal obesity was first diagnosed and the baseline visit (2005). The person years were calculated as the sum of follow-up times from the baseline until an assumed time of abdominal obesity development or until the final examination of each individual. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for incident abdominal obesity comparing the mild and moderate to severe NAFLD categories vs. the normal group. The data were adjusted, first for age alone, then for the multiple covariates. In the multivariate models, we included variables that might confound the relationship between the NAFLD and abdominal obesity, which include: age, baseline WC, total cholesterol, log(hsCRP), HOMA-IR, eGFR, current smoking status, regular exercise, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The change level of WC was calculated by following formula: WC on censoring time -baseline WC. The average change of WC was compared among 3 groups (normal, mild and moderate to severe NAFLD groups) by one-way ANOVA and χ 2 -test. P values &lt; 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

            <p>Confocal microscopy analysis. Drosophila S2 cells were plated in 12-well plastic tissue culture plate in 1 ml of Schneider's medium with 10% FBS. FITC-labeled (Invitrogen, USA) microbes were added to each well containing S2 cells at a density of 5 3 10 6 , followed by incubation for 1 hr at 28uC. After washes with PBS, the S2 cells were transferred to Poly-Prep glass slides (Sigma, USA) and fixed. Then the S2 cells were incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen, USA) or DAPI (Sigma, USA) to label actin or nucleus DNA, respectively. Fluorescent images were taken with a Zeiss Laser scanning systems LSM 510 Meta (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and processed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-simple-0">Zeiss LSM Image</rs> Examiner Version software.</p>
            <p>Analyses of gene expressions with oligonucleotide microarray. S2 cells (1 3 10 6 ) were inoculated with DCV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 hr.

Then total RNA was extracted from treated S2 cells by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total RNA samples were then analyzed by CapitalBio Corp for Chip (Affymetrix) assay. Gene expression analysis was performed by using the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) Drosophila GeneChip, using the laboratory methods in the Affymetrix GeneChip expression manual. Gene expression analysis was performed using multiple arrays and multiple independent mRNA samples for each treatment. Microarray data were analyzed by using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-4">Bio MAS (molecule annotation system)</rs> <rs corresp="#bda8ed08f7-software-4" resp="#annotator10" type="version">3.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#bda8ed08f7-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">CapitalBio Corporation</rs>, Beijing, China).

            <p>Biological pathway analysis. Through array analysis, the commonly altered genes were screened from DCV, and WSSV treatments. The selected genes were further analyzed in the context of Gene Ontology (GO) biological process and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) biological pathway.

AF332093). Primers WSSV-RT1 (59-TTGG TTTCATGCCCGAGATT-39) and WSSV-RT2 (59-CCTTGGTCAGCCCCTTGA-39) produced a fragment of 154 bp after amplification. The TaqMan probe was synthesized and labeled with the fluorescent dyes 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) (59-FAM-TGCTGCCGTCTCCAA-TAMRA-39). The reaction mixture consisted of DNA aliquot, 200 nM of each primer, 100 nM of each TaqMan probe, and 1 3 PCR reaction buffer containing DNA polymerase in a final reaction volume of 20 ml. PCR amplification was performed for 4 min at 50uC, followed by 45 cycles of 45 s at 95uC, 45 s at 52uC and 45 s at 72uC. Thermal cycling was performed on an iCycle IQ5 realtime PCR detection system (Bio-RAD, USA).</p>

            <p>The HRQoL scores that form the raw data for this analysis are rank-order in nature. Means and SDs of the scores were estimated using generalised estimating equations for illustrative purposes only. Physical and mental composite scores were calculated in the modified SF-36 according to the SF-12 scoring guidelines. <ref type="bibr">16 17</ref> Group comparison and covariate effect size calculation, OR (with 95% CIs and p values) were estimated using repeated measures of ordinal logistic regression, with covariates selected for inclusion by backward stepwise regression ( p-value for exclusion 0.22) from maternal age, Hb, ferritin, Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas ( based on the Collector District of residence of mothers), quality of sleep, use and duration of breastfeeding, hospitalisation of the baby, baby gender and mode of delivery. This included randomisation group covariate interactions in the starting model with exclusion of those interactions using the above criteria. When iron status was selected for inclusion in the model, the association between iron status (ferritin) and HRQoL was reported independently of the trial treatment group. p Values were corrected for multiple comparisons where necessary by the Holm method. The effect of intravenous iron versus oral iron on time of cessation of breastfeeding was compared by estimation of the HR with 95% CIs and p values by Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for covariates selected for inclusion by backward stepwise regression ( p-value for exclusion 0.22). The time to cessation of breast-feeding was taken from the subject's baby growth booklet for all participants. Neonatal growth in the treatment groups was compared by multivariate third-order polynomial regression as an approximation to APEG growth assessment.

Insulin doses of 0.5 and 2 units/kg gave identical signaling responses. LEAF-purified anti-mouse Ly-6G antibodies, LEAFpurified anti-mouse tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a antibodies (MP6-XT22), and LEAF-purified anti-mouse CD54 antibodies and their isotype control IgG antibodies (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) were used for neutrophil depletion, TNF-a neutralization, and ICAM-1 neutralization, respectively. Immunoblot analysis. Epididymal fat pads were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer exactly as done earlier <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. Samples underwent 7.5% SDS-PAGE (for each 100-mg sample). The resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked in 5% milk in TBS-T (TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20), and incubated overnight at 4°C with goat anti-mouse MPO (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-mouse b-actin (1:10,000), anti-phosphorylated (p)-Ser473 Akt (1:1000), anti-Akt (1:1000), anti-p-Ser9 glycogen synthase kinase (GSK; 1:1000), anti-GSK (1:1000), anti-cPLA 2 a (1:200; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX; 1:1000; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), or anti-cyclogenase-2 (COX-2; 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.). After being washed with TBS-T (four washes for 15 min each), the membranes were incubated with 1:10,000 dilutions of the respective horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1.5 h at room temperature.

Epididymal fat tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned using a Leica microtome (Leica Biosystem, Vienna, Austria). Neutrophil staining by rat anti-mouse monoclonal anti-NIMP-R14 antibody to identify neutrophils (Novus Biological Inc.) was analyzed as done before <ref type="bibr">(9,13)</ref>, based on an earlier study <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>. Nonspecific reactivity was blocked by incubating the slides with 20% normal rabbit serum for 20 min with avidin-biotin VECTA-STAIN Kit Elite PK 6105 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were then incubated in 1:10 dilution of anti-NIMP-R14 antibodies in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and further incubated with 1:200 dilution of biotinylated anti-rat IgG, followed by avidin-biotin complex/HRP-DAB, which resulted in brown staining of neutrophils. For each treatment, a negative control was prepared without the primary antibody.

            <p>Renal morphology was evaluated using Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS)-stained 5-m paraffin sections, based on at least 50 glomeruli per kidney section. The percentage of glomeruli containing microaneurysms was counted in sections from rats terminated at day 7. The Glomerular Sclerosis Index (GSI) was calculated as previously described <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> in sections from rats terminated at day 28. For the GSI, glomeruli were scored based on the percentage of the glomerular area that was sclerotic (normal = 0, ! 25% = 1, 25-50% = 2, 50-75% = 3, 75-100% = 4).

Normal distributions were tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The Levene's test was applied assessing the homogeneity of variances for between-group comparisons. Baseline overall cognitive state and differences in demographics between groups, selected and unselected participants of the CT, and drop-outs and completers of the CPT were compared between groups. We used t-tests for independent samples to compare the age, Mann-Whitney tests to compare performance in DemTect and education, and chi-square tests for the comparison of the sex distribution, each with a significance level of α=0.05. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="be3bdc5c5f-software-1">G*Power</rs> (<rs corresp="#be3bdc5c5f-software-1" resp="#annotator8" type="url">http://www.gpower.hhu.de</rs>) was used to estimate the achieved power with a post hoc analysis. <ref type="bibr">37</ref></p>
            <p>Gains from CT from pre-to post-test and to 1 year follow-up were estimated with analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures (rANOVAs) with a significance level of α=0.05. Due to the intercorrelations between the different cognitive variables (eg, DemTect subscores with the total score), a multivariate analysis was not appropriate. The within-subject variable Time had three levels (pretest vs post-test vs follow-up). The between-subject variable Training had two levels (CPT vs pure CT). The interaction Time × Training was used to specify which training group showed stronger effects. We report Greenhouse-Geisser values to handle possible violations of sphericity. The effect size partial η² (η p ²) is reported, indicating a small (η p ².0.01), moderate (η p ².0.06), or strong effect (η p ².0.14). <ref type="bibr">38</ref> In a second step, post hoc pairwise comparisons were calculated for the significant Time effects of the rANOVAs. The Bonferroni correction of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="be3bdc5c5f-software-simple-5">SPSS</rs> was used to prevent an inflated type I error, with an overall value of α=0.05. Here, the effect size d is reported, indicating a small (d.0.10), moderate (d.0.30), or strong effect (d.0.50). <ref type="bibr">38</ref> If variables violated the assumptions of normal distribution and homogeneity of variances, the Friedman's ANOVA was used as a nonparametric equivalent. The effect size ω is reported, indicating a small (ω.0.10), moderate (ω.0.30), or strong effect (ω.0.50). <ref type="bibr">38</ref> The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used in this case to compare the gains achieved within the training groups as a post hoc test for the significant variables of the Friedman's ANOVAs. The Bonferroni procedure was applied manually to prevent an inflated type I error (α=0.05/ comparisons per group). The effect size ϕ is reported, indicating a small (ϕ.0.10), moderate (ϕ.0.30), or strong effect (ϕ.0.50). <ref type="bibr">38</ref> The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to estimate between-group differences at the three test points with the value α=0.05.</p>

            <p>Protein expression was determined using Western blot. Briefly, following the incubation periods, HUVECs were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Applygen Technologies Incphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes. After centrifuging the lysates at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes, the supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C for future use. The protein concentrations of these extracts were determined by performing a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Equal amounts of protein samples (40 µg) were separated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham plc, Amersham, UK). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk buffer and incubated with anti-p-p38, anti-p-p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), anti-JNK (1:1,000, rabbit polyclonal antibodies; Bioworld Technology, St Louis Park, MN, USA), anti-p-38 (1:1,000, rabbit polyclonal antibodies; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA), and anti-β-actin (1:1,000, a mouse polyclonal antibody), (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) at 4°C overnight, washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G/antimouse IgG secondary antibody at 37°C for 1 hour. The antibody-bound proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).

            <p>Using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d539045eca-software-3">TALE-NT</rs> <rs corresp="#d539045eca-software-3" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.0</rs> (TALE Effector Nucleotide Targeter 2.0) <ref type="bibr">28</ref>, we were able to confirm that these positive clones are predicted to bind to either the plus or minus strand of three specific locationswithin the SCN9A bait sequence. Five of the TALE-VP16 clones are illustrated together with their corresponding position <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. To confirm these results, we first generated baits that exclude those predicted DNA target sites. For example, the positive clone T110 induced the expression of Aba resistance gene when the bait sequence is intact <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 5a)</ref> but it failed to produce surviving clones when the specific DNA target site (59-GTTGC-CTCCCC-39) was removed <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 5b)</ref>. Subsequently, we cloned these TALE-VP16 fusions into a mammalian expression vector, transiently transfected the plasmids into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and human squamous carcinoma cells (A431), and measured the expression level of SCN9A by quantitative RT-PCR (Methods, Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR). All fusions were able to effectively drive the overexpression of the SCN9A gene in both cell lines (up to 11-fold increase for HEK293 cells and 8.5-fold increase for A431 cells) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2c)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Our results clearly demonstrate that the complete library can be used to isolate TALEs that bind to a desired DNA sequence. Importantly, we observed that TALE-VP16 can be designed to bind to the minus strand of a target sequence and in addition, can also be designed to target sequences within the ORF. We emphasize that one fundamental difference between our approach and all previous applications of TALEs is that our screening procedure does not rely on TALE-DNA binding prediction algorithms <ref type="bibr">28,30</ref>. This is a considerable advantage as available algorithms may not yet fully capture the dynamics of TALE-DNA interactions. Indeed, we designed four 11-mer TALE-VP16 constructs for the same SCN9A bait sequence using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d539045eca-software-4">TALE-NT</rs> <rs corresp="#d539045eca-software-4" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.0</rs> program (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>) and observed that all fusions, as well as combinations, failed to induce the overexpression of SCN9A mRNA levels in HEK293 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2c, Supplementary Figs. 7 and 9</ref>). Additional insight can be gathered from recovered RVDs <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table 3</ref>), as none of the isolated positive TALE-VP16 clones contain RVD sequences exactly matching the canonical TALE-DNA binding code. As an example, for the target sequence 59-GTTGCCTCCCC-39, instead of the predicted canonical RVD sequence the four isolated clones contained at least one RVD difference. Therefore, the TALE-DNA binding information extracted from our library can be used in the future to refine the TALE-DNA binding algorithms.</p>
            <p>Prediction of target sequences. All rescued pGADT7-TALE-VP16 plasmids were subjected to standard Sanger sequencing using the forward primer P23 and the reverse primer P24 <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table 1)</ref>, which are flanking sequences of the DNA binding domain of TALE proteins. After extracting the RVD sequences, the TALE potential target sequences were determined by the Target Finder function of<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d539045eca-software-6">TALE-NT</rs> <rs corresp="#d539045eca-software-6" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.0</rs> 28 using the setting ''upstream base T''. Since <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d539045eca-software-7">TALE-NT</rs> <rs corresp="#d539045eca-software-7" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.0</rs> only supports sequences which are between 12 and 31 RVDs, for each TALE we conducted four searches by adding one additional RVD (HD or NN or NI or NG) to the end of our RVD sequences. The lowest score from one of these four searches was defined as ''the lowest possible score''. The targets were considered as potentially genuine only when the lowest possible score is less than 9, as lower scores indicate higher confidence of the bindings between TALE fusions and their predicted DNA target sequences.Invitrogen, #15140). For transient transfection, ,300 thousand cells in 1 mL of complete medium were plated into each well of 12-well culture treated plastic plates (Griener Bio-One, #665180) and grown for 16-20 hours. For jetPRIME (Polyplus Transfection, #114-15) transfection, up to 1 mg of the plasmid was added to 75 mL of jetPRIME buffer and 1.75 mL of jetPRIME. Transfection solutions were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The transfection mixture was then applied to the cells and mixed with the medium by gently shaking.</p>

            <p>To evaluate the performance of our method, we compared <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-0">FastPval</rs> with the traditional approach (named Exact) on a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-1">linux</rs> machine (Intel Xeon CPU E5410 2.33 GHz; 16 G of memory, <rs corresp="#a5e91fca27-software-7" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SuSE</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-7">linux</rs> <rs corresp="#a5e91fca27-software-7" resp="#curator" type="version">10.1</rs>). In the 'Exact' approach, we used quicksort and binary search in c programming. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-5">FastPval</rs> used the same sorting and searching algorithms for M1 and M2.</p>
            <p>To evaluate the accuracy of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-6">FastPval</rs>, we compared the calculated P-values with the original P-values in three different distributions: Normal, Poisson and Gumbel. For each distribution, we tested the P-values in the −log 10 (P-value) ranged from 0 to 9 (corresponding P-value range from 1 to 10 −9 , exclusively). We took 162 P-values (termed theoretical P-values) evenly distributed in each of the nine ranges (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S1)</ref>. We converted these P-values into scores with the build-in functions in the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-7">R</rs> platform, using parameters for each distribution as shown in Supplementary Table S2. Under the same parameter setting, we randomly sampled one billion data points. We used <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-8">FastPval</rs> to build models M1 and M2 from these data. Finally, we used <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-9">FastPval</rs> to convert these 162 scores into P-values (termed <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-10">FastPval</rs> P-values) with the models. The −log 10 (<rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-11">FastPval</rs> P-values) were plotted against the −log 10 (theoretical P-values) on a Log-Log QQ plot. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was also used to compare the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-12">FastPval</rs> P-values with theoretical P-values.</p>
            <p>As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-13">FastPval</rs> shows significant improvement over the 'Exact' approach. Tested on 1 billion resampling data, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-14">FastPval</rs> only used 0.11% of the memory and storage and 52.94% of model building and searching times. When we increased the dataset size to 5 billion, the 'Exact' method failed to load due to the large memory requirement, while our method was able to calculate P-values successfully. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-15">FastPval</rs> has speed, memory and storage consumption approximately linear to resembling size. The accuracies of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-16">FastPval</rs> calculated P-values from three different distributions were compared with the theoretical P-values. The results are shown in the form of Log-Log QQ plots <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S1a-c)</ref>. In all three tested distributions, the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-17">FastPval</rs> calculated P-values and the theoretical P-values are highly matched, forming a 45 degree line in the Log-Log QQ plots. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests showed the P-value = 1.000 for Normal and Poisson distributions, and 0.998 for Gumbel distribution, indicating that the calculated P-values did not deviate from the original distribution. We therefore conclude that<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-18">FastPval</rs> is accurate for calculating P-values for data from a variety of distributions.</p>
            <p>The Java GUI interface of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-19">FastPval</rs> is shown in <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S2a-c</ref>. In the 'Method' field, the user can either choose '<rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-20">FastPval</rs>' or the traditional 'Exact' method to calculate P-values. When the resembling size is greater than 10 million, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5e91fca27-software-simple-21">FastPval</rs> is the only suitable choice. In the 'Step' field, the user can either 'Generate model', or 'Calculate P-value' or 'Do both'. The 'Generate model' step allows the user to generate M1 and M2 models from the background dataset O; the 'Calculate P-value' step allows the user to calculate P-values for all the scores saved in a text file. The interface changes according to the user's selection. In the 'Generate model' step, the user has to specify the background file and directory to save two models, by clicking on 'Background file' and 'Output folder', respectively. The user also needs to select two parameters, the 'Sampling size' (N) and 'P-value cutoff' (P). The selections of P and N are affected by the balance of accuracy and speed. Bigger Ns and Ps will give more accurate P-values but will be less efficient. We recommend N = 100 000 and P = 0.001. N * P should be within the range of 10 to 1000, preferably 100. After the models are generated, the program will automatically change to the 'Calculate P-value' step, with default model files selected. The user will need to specify the file with scores for P-value calculation, by clicking on 'Sample file'. For scores that are out of the boundary of both models, the user can choose either 'Extreme distribution' or 'Normal distribution' in the 'Assumed distribution' field to calculate the P-value, or simply select 'No distribution' to assign the P-value to 0. The parameters of both distributions were calculated from the fitting of the dataset N.</p>

            <p>Cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 C. Fixation was performed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. During the last minute, few drops of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS were added to the cells. Afterwards cells were washed three times in PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 3 min at room temperature, followed by 5 min in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. Finally, cells were washed with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween20) twice for 5 min at room temperature and stored at 4 C. All the subsequent steps were carried out at 37 C. Cells were washed in PBS-T three times for 5 min before antibody staining. Afterwards they were incubated with the primary antibody in 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS-T for 1 h in a humidified chamber. Cells were then again washed in PBS-T three times for 3 min and incubated with the suitable secondary antibody in 4% BSA in PBS-T for 1 h. After washing with PBS-T twice for 5 min, the DNA was counterstained with 50 ng/ml of DAPI in PBS-T for 5 min. Slides were rinsed again in PBS-T and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector).

            <p>Dust exposure to rice mill workers was measured with the help of Respicon Particle Sampler {Model: 8522, TSI, USA; Instrument type-two stage, virtual impactor, with three stage gravimetric filter sampler; 50% cut aerodynamic dia.-Inlet: 100 micron, Stage 1: 4 micron, Stage 2: 10 micron, Stage 3: all remaining particles; Filter type-37 mm diameter fiberglass without organic binders or PVC filters with 5.0 micrometer pore size; Sample flow rate-3.11 liters per minute} before and after mechanical intervention. The Respicon Particle Sampler (RPS) has three filters where different sizes of dust are being collected. The dust was measured by two methods: (i) Sampler was mounted in the breathing zone of worker <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a)</ref> and allowed him to perform his work from 4 to 7 hours. The data collected through this method is presents as dust at feeding-cum-sieving section because the same person was moving from feeding to sieving during work.(ii) Sampler was fixed at one place <ref type="figure">Fig. 1b)</ref> and started collecting dust for 4 to 7 hours during the mill operation. The dust concentration was collected at various zones viz feeding, sieving, polishing and packaging via this method. To determine the mass concentration of each of the size fractions, the three Respicon Particle Sampler filters were post-weighed on the same digital micro-balance as was used to pre-weigh the filters. The calculation of dust concentration of each size fraction namely respirable, thoracic, inhalable and total dust was carried out through <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ab4ece12b6-software-0">Data Spread</rs> sheet (<rs corresp="#ab4ece12b6-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">TSI</rs>, USA) using Eqs. 1 to 4.</p>

            <p>Statistical analysis. The data were presented as mean 6 s.e.m., where appropriate. The neuron density was derived from MAP2-positive cells that were counted in fluorescent images and converted to the number of neurons per mm <ref type="bibr">2</ref>, and the soma area of individual MAP2-positive cells was estimated, using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e5f74d256f-software-simple-0">ImageJ</rs>. The percentage of excitatory and inhibitory neurons was obtained by visually identifying the number of MAP2-positive and vGLUT1-positive neurons or MAP2-positive and GAD67-positive neurons, and divided by the number of MAP2-positive neurons examined. The peak Ba 21 currents were normalized to the cell membrane capacitance and presented as current density. To determine the basal Ca 21 level and cytosolic Ca <ref type="bibr">21</ref> oscillations, cells with the basal F340/F380 value within the average 6 2 3 standard deviation were included in analysis, and a Ca 21 spike was defined with its amplitude being .1.2 times of the basal level. The number of Ca 21 oscillation per minute and the changes in F340/F380 were used to calculate the frequency and amplitude. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents were analyzed using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e5f74d256f-software-3">Clampfit</rs> (<rs corresp="#e5f74d256f-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>) and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e5f74d256f-software-4">Mini Analysis Progrom</rs> (<rs corresp="#e5f74d256f-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Synaptosoft</rs>). The last 10 AP-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs were averaged to obtain the postsynaptic current amplitude which was used to construct the cumulative distribution as described previously <ref type="bibr">17</ref>. PPF value was derived by the ratio of the second EPSC over the first EPSC and PPD value by the ratio of the second IPSC over the first IPSC. Statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t-test for the mean data and using Kolmogorov-Smirnov for the cumulative distribution of spontaneous and evoked EPSC and IPSC, with the difference to be considered significant at p , 0.05.</p>

            <p>The morphological features of the cultured HPCs were observed under phase-contrast microscopy (ECLIPSE TS100, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) during the entire culture period, and cultures were evaluated on the basis of cell shape and size, colony formation, cell density, cytoplasm to nucleus ratio and colony size. Images were acquired and processed using digital imaging software (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="bb469ce67b-software-0">NIS-Elements</rs> <rs corresp="#bb469ce67b-software-0" resp="#annotator1" type="version">F3.0</rs>).</p>
            <p>For transcriptional profiling of HPCs, the high-density microarray GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, CA, USA) was used to characterize mRNA expression following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cultured HPCs and primary hepatocytes using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Single-and double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from qualified total RNA samples using the GeneChip 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix). Three samples of total RNA (200 ng) pooled from five different specimens of each cell type were used for cDNA synthesis. After double-stranded cDNA cleanup and a quality check, in vitro transcription was performed using the GeneChip IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix) to produce biotin-labeled cRNA from the cDNA. The Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays were hybridized at 45 °C for 16 h at 60 rpm with a hybridization cocktail containing 15 µg of fragmented and labeled cRNA in a hybridization oven (Affymetrix). The arrays were then washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SAPE, Molecular Probes, OR, USA). All hybridization assay methods, including the preparation of solutions, were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. The distribution of fluorescent material on the array was detected using a 3000 7G GeneChip Scanner (Affymetrix). <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="bb469ce67b-software-2">Mi- croarray Suite</rs> version <rs corresp="#bb469ce67b-software-2" resp="#annotator1" type="version">5.0</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="bb469ce67b-software-10">GeneChip Operating Software</rs> supplied by <rs corresp="#bb469ce67b-software-10" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Affymetrix</rs> were used for gene expression analysis.

            <p>(i) RT DNA synthesis was evaluated using a 214-nt RNA or DNA template that corresponds to the HIV-1 sequence used for (À) strong stop DNA synthesis <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). The RNA and DNA templates were prepared as described previously <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. Both the RNAand DNA-dependent DNA synthesis reactions were primed with the same 5 0 -end-32 P-labeled 18-nt DNAC for 30 min (DNA-dependent DNA synthesis) or 60 min (RNA-dependent DNA synthesis) and then quenched by addition of 20 ml of gel loading buffer (98% deionized formamide containing 1 mg/ml each of bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol). Samples were then denatured at 95 C for 10 min and polymerization products were separated from substrates by denaturing gel electrophoresis using 14% acrylamide gels containing 7 M urea. DNA synthesis was analyzed by phosphorimaging using a GS-525 Molecular Imager and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-0">Quantity One</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc</rs>., Hercules, CA, USA). (ii) Inhibition of HIV-1 RT DNA synthesis was also evaluated to determine IC 50 values using a 5 0 -end-32 P-labeled 19-nt DNA primer (5 0 -TTGTAG CACCATCCAAAGG-3 0 ) that was annealed to oneof three 36-nt DNA templates that contained five consecutive thymine, cytosine or adenosine bases. In this regard, inhibition of HIV-1 RT DNA synthesis by analogs with adenine, guanine or thymine bases were evaluated using the templates (T1, 5</p>
            <p>, respectively. The T1 template was used for inhibition of WT and mutant HIV-1 RT DNA synthesis by each of the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analogs. Reaction conditions and gel electrophoresis were identical to those described above except 100 nM of WT or mutant HIV-1 RT was used to initiate the reaction. Reactions were quenched following incubation at 37 C for 10 min. The amount of final product on the denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels was quantified by densiometric analysis using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-simple-2">Quantity One</rs> Software. The concentration of each 6-modified-3 0 -azidoddGTP analog required to inhibit the formation of final product by 50% was calculated using nonlinear regression analyses (<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-2">SigmaPlot</rs> Software Version <rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-2" resp="#annotator26" type="version">11</rs>, <rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Systat Software, Inc</rs>., San Jose, CA, USA) from at least three independent experiments. Two-tailed homoscedastic t-tests were used to calculate the reported P-values.</p>
            <p>Pre-steady-state incorporation of 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analogs A rapid quench instrument (Kintek RQF-3 instrument, Kintek Corporation, Clarence, PA, USA) was used for pre-steady-state experiments. The typical experiment was performed at 37 C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 and varying concentrations of nucleotide. All concentrations reported refer to the final concentrations after mixing. HIV-1 RT (200 nM) was pre-incubated with 20 nM T/P substrate, prior to rapid mixing with nucleotide and divalent metal ions to initiate the reaction that was quenched with 50 mM EDTA. The sequences of the template and 5 0 -radiolabeled primer are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The quenched samples were then mixed with an equal volume of gel loading buffer and products were separated from substrates as described above. The disappearance of substrate (20mer) and the formation of product (21-mer) were quantified using a Bio-Rad GS525 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Data were fitted by nonlinear regression with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-3">Sigma Plot</rs> software (<rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Systat Software, Inc</rs>., San Jose, CA, USA) using the appropriate equations <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. The apparent burst rate constant (k obs ) for each particular concentration of dNTP was determined by fitting the time courses for the formation of product (21mer) using the following equation: [21mer] = A[1 À exp(Àk obs t)], where A represents the burst amplitude. The turnover number (k pol ) and apparent dissociation constant for dNTP (K d ) were then obtained by plotting the apparent catalytic rates (k obs ) against dNTP concentrations and fitting the data with the following hyperbolic equation: k obs = (k pol [dNTP])/([dNTP]+K d ). Catalytic efficiency was calculated as the ratio of turnover number over dissociation constant ([k pol /K d ]). Selectivity for natural dNTP versus 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analog was calculated as the ratio of catalytic efficiency of dNTP over that of the 6-modified-3</p>
            <p>Molecular models of incorporation were constructed using the X-ray crystallographic coordinates (PDB entry 1 RTD) for the RT-T/P-TTP ternary complex <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. The 3 0 -OH of the primer strand as well as the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-2 0 ,3-ddGTP analogs and complementary bases in the template strand were built into the model to generate a pre-initiation complex, as described previously <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. Tautomerization and protonation potential of the entire system was calculated using the Generalized Born/Volume Integral (GB/VI) electrostatics method of Labute <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>.

To eliminate the potential force field bias from alignment of bases, empirically derived angle relations were used for all analogs tested. 3KLF and 3KLE were fit to the p66 subunit of 1RTD using the Matchmaker function in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-4">Chimera</rs> version <rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-4" resp="#annotator26" type="version">1.51</rs> (<rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">UCSF Chimera, Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California</rs>, San Francisco).

Throughout the document, P values were 2-sided; furthermore, P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The age difference of cases and controls was calculated by Welch t tests, and the exact test was used to determine whether the SNPs departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The association between the minor allele and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH was evaluated by Pearson x 2 test. To assess the association between each genotype and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH, 5 models were used, including the codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and log-additive model.

Unconditional logistic regression analysis was adjusted for age. In order to eliminate the probability of falsepositive results, Bonferroni multiple adjustment was applied to the level of significance, which was set at P &lt; 0.0017 (0.05/30).</p>

All trees in the seed orchard derived from Honghuaerji in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. PCR amplifi cations were performed in 20-μ L volumes that included 50-80 ng of genomic DNA, 5 μ M concentrations of each primer, and 10 μ L 2 × PCRMaster Mix consisting of 0.1 unit/ μ L Taq DNA polymerase, 4 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.4 mM dNTP (Aidlab Co.

The PCR reactions were performed in a Veriti Dx 96-well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 ° C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 95 ° C for 30 s, annealing for 45 s at the optimal temperature for each primer pair , and 72 ° C for 30 s, with a fi nal extension of 10 min at 72 ° C <ref type="table">( Table 1 )</ref>. PCR products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gels using an HT-CX01 gel sequencing cell (Hongtao Jiye Technology Development Co. Ltd., Beijing, China).

It is hence possible, for bioinformaticians, to organize and automate complex data processing. Such possibilities have also been offered on web interfaces, either in dedicated systems such as <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-16">Remora</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Carrere and Gouzy, 2006)</ref>, or within some of the web-based systems cited above. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-17">PISE</rs>, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-18">Galaxy</rs> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-19">BioExtract</rs> also offer the possibility to save interactively designed protocols.</p>
            <p>Many of these systems now offer the possibility of accessing distributed resources, often using dedicated web-service solutions such as <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-20">BioMOBY</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-21">SoapLab</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Senger et al., 2003)</ref>. While <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-22">SoapLab</rs> offers a system to automate the distribution of asynchronous analytical services, the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-23">BioMOBY</rs> protocol provides in addition more detailed descriptions, including semantic metadata and a registration system to facilitate the discovery of relevant resources.

Many of the existing user interfaces rely on the descriptions provided by these systems to generate user interfaces: Ajax Command Definition from <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-29">EMBOSS</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Rice et al., 2000)</ref>, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-30">BioMOBY</rs> or even pure WSDL definitions.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-31">Mobyle</rs> is a generic web-based framework. While including advanced technologies such as web services, remote execution and dataflow mechanisms, it addresses major end-user concerns arising from the use of sophisticated bioinformatics systems. A recent study <ref type="bibr">(Gordon and Sensen, 2007a)</ref> shows how simple issues in the user interface can impede the use of a system by scientists, causing them to waste time and even preventing them from using it further. To address this issue, the design of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-32">Mobyle</rs>'s interface is user-centered, to provide a usable yet customizable access to a large panel of services, from genome analysis to structural bioinformatics. The description language it uses to generate user interfaces is sufficiently extensive and flexible for rich user interfaces to be generated. Its core partly relies on concepts previously embedded in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-33">PISE</rs> and the RPBS portal <ref type="bibr">(Alland et al., 2005)</ref>. Moreover, different <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-34">Mobyle</rs> servers can be federated to integrate services distributed over various sites. This functionality enables the federation of a network of curated portals, combining the skills of each of them. The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-35">Mobyle</rs> program description language also enables to define web services, as shown by the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-36">PlayMOBY Mobyle companion tool</rs>, which automates the publication of <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-37">BioMOBY</rs> web services, and has monitoring capabilities that provide the bases for service quality monitoring.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-38">Mobyle</rs> design process was based on a user-centered design process <ref type="bibr">(Javahery et al., 2004; Letondal and Amanatian, 2004; Shachak et al., 2007)</ref>, involving numerous interviews and a number of users workshops (see Section 4.1). We identified the major end-user concerns that needed to be addressed:</p>
            <p>In this section, we provide an overview of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-39">Mobyle</rs>. We describe the underlying concepts of the system, the design of the web user interface, the server components and the distributed architecture.</p>
            <p>One of the shortcomings of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-69">PISE</rs> environment is its lack of support for a persistent user workspace <ref type="bibr">(Gilbert, 2002</ref>). The new system, while still allowing a fast and temporary 'guest' access to the programs, also gives to the users the possibility to create registered accounts, which allows user data and jobs to be maintained and managed across multiple work sessions.</p>
            <p>Based on feedback from <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-41">PISE</rs> server administrators, as well as the need to extend the capacity of functionalities such as web service wrapping or workflow management, we modified the schema that describes the system. All <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-42">Mobyle</rs> data, including program descriptions, job definitions and user workspaces are stored in XML documents. The main element of the system, the program description, is inherited from the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-43">PISE</rs> system. It describes various aspects, in a language that targets simplicity as much as possible (experience shows that the authoring and maintenance of program descriptions is a complex and tedious task). Aspects covered include:</p>
            <p>• <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-44">BioMoby</rs> integration: the XML files can be enriched with metadata such as <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-45">BioMoby</rs> parameter types, which permits the publication of a program as a <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-46">BioMoby</rs> service using<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-47">PlayMOBY</rs> (see Section 3.6).</p>
            <p>A formal description of the XML grammar used to describe<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-73">Mobyle</rs> programs is available on the project webpage (see <rs corresp="#a5c2e682e4-software-73" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// bioweb2.pasteur.fr/projects/mobyle/downloads.html</rs>), using Relax NG <ref type="bibr">(Clark et al., 2001)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-50">Mobyle</rs> system aims at acting as a 'hub' for a set of programs of interest. A program integrated in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-51">Mobyle</rs> can not only be local but also remote, using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-52">Mobyle</rs> Net functionality (further described in Section 3.5). Additionally, current and future developments aim at providing gateways to web-service-based systems such as <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-53">BioMOBY</rs> (see Section 3.6). The interest is to provide a unified framework for bioinformatics platforms maintainers, who have to publish and integrate various local or remote programs for both biologists and bioinformaticians.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-54">Mobyle</rs> provides the scientist with a global and integrated view of all the elements needed to perform his or her analyses. At one glance, the user can see which programs are available and which analyses have already been run. The portal is organized in three main parts <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>: a left navigation panel, a central panel displaying a selection of elements of the current work, such as forms and results, and horizontal tabs enabling the user to navigate between these elements.</p>
            <p>A major aspect of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-55">Mobyle</rs> is its capacity to facilitates automated data conversion and formatting for service integration, thus saving the user from tedious and non-scientific data manipulation tasks. The<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-56">Mobyle</rs> typing system describes program parameters using a typing mechanism that aims to help users in such tasks. It modifies the interface display, the controls for user values (the input parameters), the possibility of chaining between programs and data reusability.</p>
            <p>Similarly to <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-80">SWAMI</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Rifaieh et al., 2007)</ref>, data and parameter characterization is multidimensional:</p>
            <p>In contrast with other typing systems, such as the one offered by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-58">BioMOBY</rs>, the parameter compatibility between two tasks is based on a more abstract description. Since the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-59">Mobyle</rs> system can convert the data to the format which is accepted by the next task, there is no need to have service interoperability rely on a bioinformatics format description. For instance, in the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-60">Mobyle</rs> Pasteur server,the user can align a set of protein sequences using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-61">clustalwmultialign interface</rs>, then pipe the clustalw-formatted result to<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-62">Phylip</rs> protdist: although this program only accepts <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-63">Phylip</rs>-formatted multiple alignments, the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-64">squizz</rs> program, which handles sequence and alignment conversions, will automatically detect and convert the multiple alignment into the accepted format. This approach simplifies the construction of the protocol: the user does not have to specify data transformation tasks, allowing optimal handling of the data (the format conversion information is directly accessible in the job result page). This typing system is configurable and relies on a 'best-effort' approach. Tasks such as format detection or conversion are handled by the system only if they are compatible with the local configuration.</p>
            <p>This feature underlies the difference in what is considered to be a 'service' between <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-65">Mobyle</rs> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-66">BioMOBY</rs>: in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-67">Mobyle</rs>, data format conversions should be, as far as possible, considered as mere connectors in the analysis dataflow, whereas in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-68">BioMOBY</rs> they are considered to be on the same level as other analysis programs. Furthermore, since some programs accept multiple data formats as inputs, publishing them in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-69">BioMOBY</rs> involves registering multiple services on the registry (one per accepted format), whereas they are published as a single 'interface' in <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-70">Mobyle</rs>.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-71">Mobyle</rs> server, based on a set of python modules, handles the various aspects of job, data and session managements. The most important of these, job submission, includes:</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-72">Mobyle</rs> network allows the execution of programs that are available on different <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-73">Mobyle</rs> servers from a single portal. This feature facilitates user access to services physically distributed over different <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-74">Mobyle</rs> servers, within an integrated environment enabling data reuse and program chaining. As opposed to <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-75">BioMOBY</rs>, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-76">Mobyle</rs> does not provide any central repository to register new services, relying instead on a distributed registration: each <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-77">Mobyle</rs> server administrator chooses to publish a number of services, which can be upon his choice exported to or imported from remote <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-78">Mobyle</rs> servers. Remote program invocation relies on the import of the remote program XML descriptions. Upon submission, this allows to generate a call to the remote server instead of generating and submitting a local batch call. In such a configuration, the user workspace, as well as the local jobs, remain stored on the initial server, but remotely invoked jobs are directly linked from their execution servers <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>. We demonstrate the use of this facility for the easy comparative modelling of the structure of a protein identified from analysis of the sunflower genome. A step by step tutorial is available on the MobyleNet help pages (http://mobyle.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/ help/MobyleTutorials_network.html). This task can be broken down into several successive steps: inferring protein sequence from the genomic information, performing a search for a template structure, fitting the query sequence to the template and then generating a 3D model. Protein sequence inference can currently be performed through the LIPM <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-79">Mobyle</rs> server, using the heliagene resource dedicated to sunflower genomic information. The next steps can be achieved through the RPBS <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-80">Mobyle</rs> server using a two pass blast (PDBblast service) to identify candidate template structures from the query sequence. Sequence alignment can be performed through the Institut Pasteur <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-81">Mobyle</rs> server using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-82">clustalw</rs> service. Finally, the 3D modelling and model visualization/analysis can be performed through the RPBS site <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-83">Mobyle</rs> network allows efficient organization of the complete sequence of tasks as a pipeline, without having to leave the RPBS <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-84">Mobyle</rs> portal, but making use of the resources and services at the three sites.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-85">PlayMOBY</rs> is an external <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-86">Mobyle</rs> companion tool allows the publication of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-87">BioMOBY</rs>-compliant web services, using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-88">Mobyle</rs> program descriptions. From the same XML description, bioinformatics programs can thus be both published on the<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-89">Mobyle</rs> network and used by the code generator of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-90">PlayMOBY</rs> in order to implement, register and validate <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-91">BioMOBY</rs> web services automatically. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-92">PlayMOBY</rs> also integrates a perl library to generate the corresponding <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-93">Mobyle</rs> XML description file from program parameters. Thus, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-94">PlayMOBY</rs> reduces the overheads of publishing <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-95">BioMOBY</rs> web services. To date, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-96">PlayMOBY</rs> handles more than 100 <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-97">BioMOBY</rs> web services for providing generic sequence analysis tools and ensuring the interoperability of specialized databases (http://www.legoo.org, http://www.heliagene .org and http://narcisse.toulouse.inra.fr).</p>
            <p>In addition to web service deployment, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-98">PlayMOBY</rs> provides daily monitoring tools for the deployed web services. During the<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-99">Mobyle</rs> to <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-100">PlayMOBY</rs> format conversion step, a service developer can provide a test dataset for each service input. These data are used to test web services availability and consistency by the provider himself. We made the choice to not allow web services users to launch these tests, which are instead automatically launched.</p>
            <p>The tests consist in verifying accessibility to the web service and consistency and stability of the results on test data. Their results are published as XML reports and RSS feeds. The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-101">PlayMOBY</rs> description for the QoS presently follows the specifications stated by the BioWorkflow group <ref type="bibr">(Wessner et al., 2008)</ref>. However, it could easily be extended to other frameworks such as the BioCatalogue project <ref type="bibr">(Belhajjame et al., 2008)</ref>. In the case of failures or unexpected results, alerts are sent by e-mail to the developers. Thus,<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-102">PlayMOBY</rs> also provides the framework to evaluate <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-103">Mobyle</rs> service reliability and curation. This problem is particularly important in bioinformatics, given the volatility of tools (especially web-based), impairing the reliability of biological data processing.</p>
            <p>The Institut Pasteur, RPBS and LIPM <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-104">Mobyle</rs> servers have been publicly available since January 2008, October 2008 and January 2009, respectively. The Pasteur server provides access to a wide range of bioinformatics tools mainly focused on sequence analysis and phylogeny; the LIPM server offers access to tools related to plant genomics; and the RPBS server publishes programs that mainly concern structural bioinformatics. Over 400 000 jobs have already been submitted by over 40 000 different users throughout the world on these servers.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-105">Mobyle</rs> project arose from the natural evolution of software such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-106">PISE</rs>, offering a simple way to publish and to share bioinformatics software on the Web. Program chaining is limited to the most common usage patterns that we identified, and does not provide any of the advanced workflow patterns included in previously described systems (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-107">Taverna</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-108">Kepler</rs>). It is not either intended to handle analyses of very large quantities of data, data transfer over the network being too costly for web-based applications.</p>
            <p>• the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-109">Mobyle</rs> network enables the integration of local software with remote services, reducing the costs associated with the local maintenance of an exhaustive list of programs. Application of this strategy over several <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-110">Mobyle</rs> sites should help to connect providers, generating a framework that emcompasses a wide spectrum of applications and covers complementary aspects of bioinformatics. This strategy needs to be tested for a large number of sites; however, we anticipate the generation of a confidence network combining specific tools offered by each platform and thus promoting quality management of the services.</p>
            <p>• deployment of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-111">BioMOBY</rs> web services from bioinformatics programs is made available through <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-112">PlayMOBY</rs>. It thus benefits from the conceptual strength of the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-113">BioMOBY</rs> architecture, while avoiding the duplication of wrapper authoring effort, using a common format for both <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-114">Mobyle</rs> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-115">BioMOBY</rs> publications. Additionally, it encourages good practices such as services monitoring by integrating the design of tests into the publication process.</p>
            <p>Workflows and protocols: <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-116">Mobyle</rs> already embeds a prototype dataflow-oriented workflow engine, enabling the chaining of successive or parallel tasks to be automated. It runs on top of the<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-117">Mobyle</rs> core library, exploiting the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-118">Mobyle</rs> network to execute tasks distributed between local and remote servers, and orchestrates the tasks to synchronize their execution with the availability of all their input data. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-119">Mobyle</rs> workflows modelize a set of tasks, but in contrast with existing workflow languages such as SCUFL in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-120">Taverna</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Oinn et al., 2004)</ref> or MoML in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-121">Kepler</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Altintas et al., 2004)</ref>, do not specify explicitly some low-level data format detection and transformation tasks. Authors are, whenever possible according to local configuration, not asked to specify these steps. Hence, the storage of workflow definitions is planned to be based on an extension of the current <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-122">Mobyle</rs> XML language, as they are based on a higher level perspective on the analyses they describe. An interesting outcome is the possibility to save an interactively designed program chaining as a reusable composite service. This perspective provides a gateway towards the publication of useracknowledged protocols on a community-based platform such as myexperiment.org <ref type="bibr">(De Roure et al., 2007)</ref>. Future end-user access to the workflow definitions and workflow engine will be integrated to the current web interface.</p>
            <p>Web services: the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-123">PlayMOBY</rs> system already allows the automated publication of <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-124">BioMOBY</rs> web services using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-125">Mobyle</rs> program definitions. Future work also includes enabling the use of other approaches such as custom SOAP or REST interfaces, and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-126">SoapLab</rs>. Enabling the integration of such services as remote programs, for which the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-127">Mobyle</rs> Web Portal acts as a client will also be considered.</p>
            <p>Didactic tutorials: further developments will encompass the design of tutorials. As explained by <ref type="bibr">Cattley and Arthur (2007)</ref>, integrated web portals are a very efficient learning and teaching tool.<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-128">Mobyle</rs> additionally provides technical support for implementing interactive tutorials. A major issue to be incorporated in its design is to make more interactive components available: as shown by user studies, workflows should be available as semi-automatic protocols, with interactive components enabling the biologist to customize the visualization of the result from an analysis (e.g. a 3D molecule or an alignment).</p>
            <p>The design of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-129">Mobyle</rs>, which provides an effective way to make a large panel of curated bioinformatics tools available in a homogeneous environment, has been driven with the concern to meet the requirements of different audiences-biologists and bioinformaticians, mostly. Our objective was thus to facilitate the access to complex features and advanced technologies by a design</p>

            <p>The genome-scale mapping of promoter sites has been performed by our pattern recognition software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-0">PlatProm</rs> <ref type="bibr">(6,7)</ref>. The same as other protocols operating with position-specific weight matrices, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-1">PlatProm</rs> has an advantage of predicting transcription start points (TSP) (the main promoter attribute, which is determined experimentally), rather than to define promoter regions as extensive genomic loci <ref type="bibr">(9,10,15,16)</ref>. Upon scanning <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-2">PlatProm</rs> considers any nucleotide as a probable point of transcription initiation and scores this probability by searching for promoter-specific elements in proper positions. Rather high precision and low rate of false positives made our software suitable for genome scanning, providing a possibility to compare in silico and in vivo data. In the present work, we describe an overall map of TSPs predicted by<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-3">PlatProm</rs>; evaluate the degree of correlation between<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-4">PlatProm</rs> scores and RNAPol-binding efficiency registered by two independent research groups <ref type="bibr">(12,13)</ref>; focus attention on intragenic TSPs and promoter 'islands' having high density of transcription signals over long distance; and verify capacity of one 'island' to bind RNAPol and initiate RNA synthesis.</p>
            <p>Our scoring system was designed as originally suggested by <ref type="bibr">Hertz and Stormo (17)</ref>. Sensitivity of this algorithm tested on our sets was the same as reported <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>. To increase the performance of this approach, we took into account sequence-dependent structural features in the genomic environment of promoter sites <ref type="bibr">(6, 7)</ref>. The final version of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-5">PlatProm</rs> <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref> was refined on 271 experimentally identified non-homologous and non-overlapping s 70 -promoters with a single TSP precisely pointed out by the previous version of our software <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>. All sequences were 411-bp long (À255/+155 according to the start point nominated as 0). Allowed variations of the spacer, *To whom correspondence should be addressed. Tel: +7 4967 73 91 40; Fax: +7 4967 33 05 09; Email: ozoline@icb.psn.ru and the distance between the TSP and the element -10 were 14-21 and 2-9 bp, respectively. Variable length of the spacer was accounted by the matrix penalizing deviations from the optimal 17 bp in accordance with their frequencies in the training promoter set. The varying distance between element À10 and the TSP, ignored by previously published protocols, was taken into account the same way. Weight matrices corresponding to consensus elements À35 and À10 evaluated hexanucleotides, rather than 25 and 19 bp sequences, accounted by Hertz and Stormo <ref type="figure">Figure 1A and B)</ref>. They contain 6 Â 4 scores equal to natural logarithms of normalized occurrence frequencies for each nucleotide at each position in preliminarily aligned promoters. Percentage of particular nucleotides in the genome was used for normalization. Sequence preference nearby the TSP previously accounted by a 12 Â 4 weight matrix <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref> was scored by the matrix precisely reflecting the distribution of dinucleotides in À1/0. Dinucleotides forming the 'extended À10 element' were accounted the same way. Since frequency coefficients depend on promoter alignment, optimal matrices were generated by the procedure of expectation-maximization.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-6">PlatProm</rs> also takes into account perfect direct and inverted repeats (5-11 bp long separated by 5 or 6 bp) as potential targets for interaction with regulatory proteins. They are scored as natural logarithms of lengths if centered in subregions of their frequent occurrence <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Performance of the program was tested on a set of 290 known promoters and two control sets (CSs). All sequences were 411 bp long (À255/+155 according to real or virtual TSPs). The testing compilation was composed of experimentally characterized s 70 promoters not included in the training set. To increase the size of this set we allowed the presence of promoters ($30%) with multiple TSPs (for instance discussed below dcuA), while homologous or overlapping promoters were excluded. CS1 was composed of 273 coding sequences taken from the fixed position of all convergent genes longer than 700 bp, separated by 50-bp intergenic space, which are not associated with promoter 'islands' (see below) and have 5 0 -ends similarly annotated in U00096 and U00096.2 E. coli gene maps. Sequences were taken so as virtual TSPs were 250 bp far from initiating codon (fall in position 254 inside the gene). This strategy minimizes the probability to pick out functional promoter for alternative transcription or for yet unidentified genes in intergenic regions. Having AT-content (48.3%) very close to that of the whole genome (49.2%) CS1 roughly represents natural sequences, which RNAPol has to bypass. CS2 was composed of 400 random sequences with the same AT-content as in chromosomal DNA. (All compilations are available by request.) Promoters were considered as recognized by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-7">PlatProm</rs> if experimentally mapped TSP(s) or a neighboring nucleotide (AE2) had score higher than threshold level. Using this criteria and the last version of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-8">PlatProm</rs> we identified 85.5% of promoters from the test compilation at zero level of false positives (level 1, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) in both CSs (S max = 3.4). Thus, at this level the combination of sensitivity (percentage of recognized promoters = 85.5%) and specificity (percentage of unrecognized non-promoter sequences = 100%) of<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-9">PlatProm</rs> was better than that of previously suggested algorithms (68.7-82% and 82.2-99.1%, respectively) <ref type="bibr">(2,15,24)</ref> andpredicted by our software, which is also better than previously reported (&lt;50%) <ref type="bibr">(1,17)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Primer extension was carried out using RevertAid TM M-MulV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas), 4 pm of 32 P-labeled primer and variable amounts of total RNA (1-6 mkg) purified from E. coli cells grown either in LB or M9 media and harvested at logarithmic or stationary phases. Before the reaction the mixture of RNA and primer was heated at 728C for 10 min; cooled down to 588C, and primer annealing was allowed for 3 min. Then the probe was chilled on ice, mixed with the buffer provided by manufacturer and incubated with the enzyme at 428C for 45 min. Reverse transcription was terminated by heating. cDNA was precipitated by N-butanol and analyzed the same way as the products of permanganate footprinting. Single round transcription was carried out as described previously <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> demonstrates advantage given by each additional element <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref> and increased sensitivity of the program <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>C and D) for the whole testing compilation and positively regulated promoters. All additional elements improve the resolution but the largest contribution is given by w-tracts increasing sensitivity for 27.6% <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>. This high significance of additional elements provides a chance to detect regulatory regions in newly sequenced genomes if information about their own promoters is insufficient. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> exemplifies promoters accurately recognized (fadB) and unrecognized (dcuA) by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-10">PlatProm</rs>. The start point of fadB-transcription exactly fits the experimentally mapped TSP <ref type="figure">(Figure 2B)</ref>, while the original program <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref> suggests intragenic P1 as a dominant transcription signal <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>A) and algorithm developed by Huerta and Collado-Vides (1) predicts fadB promoter $150 bp upstream of the real TSP [see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> in <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>].</p>
            <p>Although it can not be excluded that P dcuA has some important determinants, which are not formalized by<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-11">PlatProm</rs>, limitations of experimental mapping performed by primer extension (28) also may result in some difference between apparent and actual TSPs. Reverse transcriptase, for example, can stop at sites with stable hairpins in mRNA structure. In this case, the registered site of transcription initiation would be pointed out downstream from the real one. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-12">PlatProm</rs> predicts a good candidate (P2) perfectly fitting the RNAPol-binding site registered by ChIP-on-chip assay (Figure 2F). Thus, comparing in silico and in vivo data one should take into account finite sensitivity and selectivity of computer model as well as limited accuracy of experimental approaches. Even though <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-13">PlatProm</rs> may be further improved on the basis of additional features, current version predicts TSPs with rather high accuracy and was used to depict the genome-wide distribution of potentially transcribed regions.</p>
            <p>The genome sequence of E. coli K12 (NCBI, GenBank entry U00096.2) was used for large-scale promoter prediction (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 1</ref> for all <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-14">PlatProm</rs> scores on both strands). Only signals with S &gt;7.44 (level 2 in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>D) were considered reliable. This cut-off level provides a possibility to identify only 51.0% of known promoters (Figure 1D) but ensures p &lt; 0.000043 (Student's T-test statistics) if average S (À5.0) and SD (3.1) were estimated using scores of CS1. Artificially generated sequences of CS2 showed the same variability of S (SD = 3.1) but average score was higher (À4.2), thus assuming $2.5-fold higher p-value (p &lt; 0.00011). A total of 30 188 individual or clustered TSPs <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) forming $5000 promoter-like regions were found. Since only half of known promoters have TSPs with S &gt;7.44, the data obtained presume existence of more than 9000 of separate promoter-like sites, which is twice greater than the number of annotated genes in the genome of E. coli. To what extent this excess could be explained by the presence of false positives?</p>
            <p>Relying on p-values only 399-928 of 30 188 predicted TSPs (1-3%) may be false signals (4 639 675 bp Â 2 Â p). However, intragenic and artificial sequences of CS1 and CS2 may be deficient in some promoter-specific features. That is why <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-15">PlatProm</rs> performance was further tested in intergenic regions separating convergent genes, even though each of them may contain yet unidentified genes. Predicted TSPs were searched in the central part of intergenic space (!250 bp from the ends of flanking genes) so as to ensure that only non-coding sequences undergo scoring. Only 15 regions between convergent genes are longer than 500 bp but two of them overlap with promoter 'islands' (see below) and were eliminated. The total length of the remaining ones is 10 226 bp (both strands).As expected, AT-content of these regions is slightly higher (49.2%) than that of CS1 (48.3%). Altogether they contain four predicted TSPs (one per $2500 bp). If all of them are spurious, the probability to come across a false positive is 0.00039, i.e. higher than p-values mentioned above. However, two predicted TSPs are perfectly suitable for small regulatory RNAs HB_48 and HB_139 predicted by Carter et al. <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> and one is located in front of IS yi21_6. Supposing that they belong to real promoters, false positive rate given by statistic analysis and scanning procedure correspond to each other. Even if p = 0.00039 is taken as a real frequency of false signals, still $90% of TSPs predicted by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-16">PlatProm</rs> should be considered as promoter-like signals deserving more detailed analysis.</p>
            <p>An important question is how to perceive <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-17">PlatProm</rs> signals forming clusters near real and accurately recognized by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-18">PlatProm</rs> TSPs (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>B for example). Should they be considered as false positives or not? To address this question we compared distribution of scores in positions surrounding real (test compilation) and virtual (CS1) transcription starts <ref type="figure">(Figure 1E-G</ref>). An average S quantified for CS1 remains almost constant if the size of analyzed area increases. The number of signals exceeding 'level 1' in AE 2 and AE 5 bp area (11 and 24, respectively) corresponds to the expected values (11 and 26, respectively) if CS2 statistic is used but is twice larger than expected from p-value (&lt;0.0038) calculated on the basis of CS1 scores (6 and 12). The rate of false positives given by CS2 statistic is, therefore, quite realistic. It assumes 0.63 probability for the presence of highly scoring position in the AE 10 area around virtual TSPs of CS1 (total number of positions is 5733). One signal with S &gt;7.44 ('level 2') was really registered in this region <ref type="figure">(Figure 1G)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Portion of positions with S exceeding 'level 2' and the average S decrease upon widening of the analyzed area around real promoters, however, distribution of their scores does not reveal expected maxima typical for CS1 <ref type="figure">(Figure 1E and F)</ref>. Only in AE10 region S-values shownoticeable divergence. That means that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-19">PlatProm</rs> scores around real TSPs are higher than background values. Thus, the total number of positions with S &gt;3.4 for AE2 bp area (1681 points) is significantly larger (852) than the total number of experimentally mapped starts including multiple ones (480). Detailed examination showed that $92% of additional signals are generated by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-20">PlatProm</rs> using the same frame for À35 and À10 hexanucleotides as position with maximal S. Remaining ones correspond to alternative À10 element (4.4%) or À10 and À35 elements (3.6%), suggesting the presence of overlapping promoter. Promoters with multiple TSPs tend to have additional signals corresponding to alternative pair of core elements. Thus, in all cases <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-21">PlatProm</rs> signals proximal to known TSPs denote the presence of either the same or alternative promoter and should not be considered as false positives.</p>
            <p>Approximately 19% of the remaining TSPs were found on the opposite strand of coding sequences <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). Antisense RNAs, if initiated therein, may block translation by base pairing with mRNAs, regulate their stability or interfere in other molecular processes. Such RNAs control expression of many plasmid and transposon genes, but until now they were not considered typical for bacterial regulatory networks. Nonetheless several lines of evidence support our predictions:Thus, the first amusing outcome obtained from the genome scanning was a large amount of genes containing promoters with antisense orientation. Unexpected intragenic promoters of another group have sense orientation <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). About 23% of corresponding TSPs lie &lt;50 bp downstream from the initiating codon. They were not considered as candidates for independent transcription initiation, since corresponding promoter-like regions may participate in polymerase trapping near real promoters (1). Some intragenic promoters may intensify transcription of properly oriented downstream genes. If they are also ignored, there are still $400 potential TSPs with a less comprehensible destination. Some of them may produce RNAs antisense to mRNAs of the convergently oriented downstream genes. Synthesis of shortened mRNAs seems to be the most exotic assumption to date. At the same time, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-33">ORF Finder</rs> (<rs corresp="#bb9998316e-software-33" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NCBI</rs>) reveals alternative ORFs supplied with a suitable Shine-Dalgarno sequence downstream of $50% of intragenic co-directed promoters.</p>
            <p>At the last step we estimated the degree of correlation between the values of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-24">PlatProm</rs> scores, and efficiencies of RNAPol binding. Since S reflects probability of any single nucleotide in the genome to be a TSP, while ChIP-on-chip method estimates efficiency of RNAPol binding to a particular genomic region represented by 50 nt probes on high-density tiled microarrays, the pattern of S should be converted into a comparable mode. Converting procedure should take into account that the geometrical center of RNAPol-binding site does not coincide with the TSP. Moreover, as RNAPol in vivo interacts with double-stranded DNA, samples prepared for chiphybridization contained both strands of enzyme-trapped fragments. Thus, fluorescent signal registered for a particular probe may result from two types of complexes differing in enzyme orientation <ref type="figure">(Figure 4A)</ref>. Supposing each 50 nt probe as a target for interaction with polymerase we thus considered the sum of S corresponding to the virtual TSPs on both strands as a probability of enzyme binding (P):</p>
            <p>As the spacer length and the distance between the TSP and À10 element differ in real promoters, AE8 nt variation in +1 positioning has been allowed. Location of these regions relative to 5 0 -ends was selected experimentally as position giving maximal correlation coefficient (R) between P and hybridization signals.Are these R H and R R values high or not? Although the data obtained in silico and in vivo reflect the same phenomena: anticipated and registered interaction with RNAPol, there are some peculiarities decreasing evaluated correlation. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-25">PlatProm</rs>, for instance, accounts putative modules for interaction with regulatory proteins as positive elements, though repressors decrease polymerase binding. Many weak RNAPol-binding sites are not detected in vivo due to low signal-to-noise ratio <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref> but<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-26">PlatProm</rs> discriminates them. Intensity of ChIP signals from some promoters may disproportionately decrease due to possibility of epitope occlusion by other interactions <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. Finally, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-27">PlatProm</rs> is currently attuned to s 70 -specific promoters, while s 70 -specific antibodies precipitate s 28 as well <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>. Usage of b 0 -specific antibodies in combination with rifampicin-chase selection allows promoters of all types to be extracted. Considering all these realities, we conclude that both values of R are rather high.</p>
            <p>To explore further this phenomenon a set of 181 known promoters accurately recognized in silico and possessing no more than two additional <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-28">PlatProm</rs> signal(s) on either strand in a AE50 bp area was compiled (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). Amid others it contains promoters P fadB , P cusC , and P cusR <ref type="figure">(Figures 2 and 4)</ref>. Only 21 promoters from this set contribute to the population of 2106 outlying probes by 42 representatives, which is exactly as much as expected by chance ($2%). The set of 'normal' promoters was compared with 78 PIs in terms of RNAPol binding and transcription efficiency calculated as described in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> legend <ref type="table">(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</ref>Since blue outliers in the second data set tend to fit better to the expected range of log 2 ratios, this slight deviation was not considered as regular and was not further analyzed. Points representing promoter 'islands' 1-3 <ref type="figure">(Figure 4B)</ref> are shown in green. The indicated values of R were quantified for the whole set of microarray probes using (log 2 ) B and P averaged within running window 3. (C) Correlation between RNAPol binding (log 2 ) B and expression (log 2 ) E efficiencies plotted for 78 PIs (red symbols) and 181 single promoters (blue symbols). For PIs (log 2 ) B were quantified as average values of ChIP-on-chip signals for all probes covering corresponding genomic areas <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table 2</ref>). (Log 2 ) E was first quantified as an average log 2 ratio of chip signals obtained upon cDNA hybridization with 10 probes representing the 250-bp region downstream from the last predicted TSP on each strand. Two values characterizing transcription in both directions were then compared and the largest one was considered as the measure of expression efficiency. Other variants of (log 2 ) E calculation see in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 2</ref>. (Log 2 ) B and (log 2 ) E for 'normal' promoters were quantified within 250 bp region upstream and downstream from the position +1, respectively (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). Both (log 2 ) B and (log 2 ) E were averaged for two replicates of Reppas et al. <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref> data set. First-order regression lines show apparent dependence between (log 2 ) B and (log 2 ) E for both promoter 'islands' and 'normal' promoters. competing promoters, which makes genomic regions differing in abundance of transcription signals dissimilar in terms of functional characteristics.</p>
            <p>Comprehensive annotation of newly sequenced genomes implying mapping of genes along with their regulatory elements is currently becoming a long-term strategy appealing for effective promoter-finders. In the case of genes encoding proteins, rRNAs and tRNAs, which by itself are accurately identified by almost perfectly attuned computer programs, promoter-finders may assist in localization of regulatory regions. In the case of genes encoding small untranslated RNAs they are used to point out positions where sRNAs may be initiated <ref type="bibr">(29,39)</ref>, whereas other programs classify potential products as putative sRNAs based on their thermodynamic features and folding propensity. In the case of aRNAs promoter-finders may provide unique indicators of potential antisense transcription. So far only two dozens of aRNAs at least partly synthesized from the antisense strands of other genes have been found in E. coli. This rather small number apparently does not reflect their multiplicity, as genome-wide expression studies registered a huge amount of RNAs generated from antisense strands <ref type="bibr">(30)</ref>; <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-29">PlatProm</rs> predicted many potential promoters for antisense transcription, while ChIP-on-chip technique detected suitable intragenic RNAPol-binding sites <ref type="bibr">(12,13)</ref>. Even though many signals registered by microarrays may result from run-through transcripts unterminated at 3 0 -ends of neighboring genes, some promoters predicted in silico may be false positives while intragenic RNAPol-binding sites may represent paused elongation complexes, combined data vote for antisense transcription in bacteria.</p>

            <p>Identifying patterns of tracked single-cell death markers over time in vivo. We next assessed whether the multilabelling of cells in vivo allowed the resolution of different patterns of apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Owing to the rapid kinetics and predominantly apoptotic mode of cell death induced by SSP, we again investigated simultaneous triple labelling in rats. Although the precise kinetics of the onset ofIn this SSP model, 1,9 single cells were identified from stills, and a random sample (n ¼ 30) was selected based on whether they were DiI positive (i.e., white spots identifying single RGCs, <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>a) and stained with annexin V-488, PI or both. A video analysis of selected tracked individual cells fulfilling these criteria (artificially labelled as light blue spots in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>b) using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="facbd4c108-software-simple-0">ImageJ</rs> software and the Time Series Analyzer plugin allowed us to construct the intensity profiles of annexin V and PI. From these profiles, it was found that typically three patterns of fluorescent labelling were observed, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>c, which is a colour map showing the distribution of cells and their staining patterns. First, some cells were found to be labelled only with PI ('PI only', red spots,(c-p) Three patterns of fluorescent labelling were identified: 'PI only' (red spots, (c), and the representative cell, arrowed in (e-g) video stills with the corresponding signal intensity profile in (h)), 'Annexin first' (annexin-V positive and subsequently PI positive, green spots (c, i-l)), 'similar profiles' (positive labelling for both dyes at the same time, yellow spots, (c, m-p)). The mean times to peak intensity (d) revealed that the appearance of the 'PI only' cells was significantly quicker than either the 'annexin first' or the 'similar profiles' cells. Intensity profiles of annexin V and PI changed significantly over time (h, l, p). These results provide evidence that neuronal cells in vivo show considerable heterogeneity with regard to the kinetics of necrotic and apoptotic cell death, and also the relative timing of phosphatidylserine exposure (early phase) and nuclear condensation (late phase). Time points and scale bar 100 mm as indicated 'Annexin first'; and m-o 'similar profiles'), with the corresponding graphs of signal intensity over time <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>h, l and p). In each illustrative case, the intensity profiles of annexin V and PI changed significantly over time. The mean timings to peak intensity of this random sample (Figure 3d) revealed that 'PI only' cells tended to show significantly shorter kinetics than either the 'Annexin first' or the 'similar profiles' cells. In addition, cells that became annexin V positive invariably also became PI positive, either within an hour or coincidentally.</p>
            <p>Using the Ab model, we assessed the effects of intravitreal Ab (Ab 25À35 ), which was recently shown by us to induce RGC apoptosis in rodent eyes. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Significant RGC death occurred 72 h after intravitreal administration of 3.40 nmol Ab 25À35 to the right eye, a time that, in previous studies, was shown by us to yield peak levels of apoptosis <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref>. The left eye of each animal was treated with intravitreal 0.40 nmol MK801 at the same time as Ab. Wide-angle retinal images were recorded 2 h after intravitreal annexin (green) and PI (red) staining, as previously described.To assess the relative levels of early apoptosis, late apoptosis and necrosis, we studied the co-localisation of PI and annexin V using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="facbd4c108-software-simple-1">ImageJ</rs> software with the Intensity Correlation Analysis plugin. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Colour and raw scatter plots of annexin and PI fluorescence intensity were constructed from plugin-generated data for each animal. The corresponding scatter plots (blue) from the eyes shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 4a and b</ref> are illustrated in Figures 4c and d. Data were analysed in a manner similar to that of data derived by in vitro FACS analysis, with four quadrants (midlines shaded in colour overlay as red, green, blue and yellow) enabling separation of the different phases of cell death as annexin V positive (early apoptosis, green), annexin V and PI double positive (late apoptosis, yellow) and PI positive (necrosis, red). Thresholds were set automatically by the plugin for the analysis of each eye. We then used fluorescence intensity counts from the raw scatter plots to quantify each phase of cell death. MK801 treatment clearly reduced the overall levels of cell death (total), but more particularly, the number of cells in late-phase apoptosis and necrosis <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>e). Interestingly, there was a small increase in the number of early-phase apoptotic cells (Anx þ ) in MK801-treated eyes (Figure 4e). As these are destined to become Anx þ /PI þ , this suggests that, although the results generally support the neuroprotective role of NMDA antagonists in Ab-induced neuronal cell death, <ref type="bibr">13</ref> it may be that the protective effects of MK801 seem transient because of its single application in these experiments.</p>
            <p>We next analysed the time sequence of annexin V and DiI changes during this period. Using a method similar to that Imaging multiple phases of neurodegeneration MF Cordeiro et al described earlier for <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we constructed a maximum intensity 3D projection of the time-lapse video sequences <ref type="figure">(Supplementary Video 3)</ref>, using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="facbd4c108-software-simple-2">Image J</rs> RGB Zprojector and JaCoP plugin. The projection enabled the quantitative assessment of maximal annexin V and DiI staining at each pixel in the same retinal area studied over time. Although there was a high overlap ratio of annexin V staining with DiI (0.63, confirming the presence of apoptosis at the level of the RGCs), there was a very low ratio (0.072) of DiI cells also positive for annexin V. This demonstrates either that only some RGCs were ever annexin V positive and that apoptosis is not the only pathway responsible for cell death in this model, or that annexin V positivity is transient (as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). We then investigated the presence of apoptotic and necrotic cells using PI and annexin V. At 3 weeks, in the OHT model, only a small proportion of RGCs was identified in early apoptosis compared with late apoptosis, as seen in a typical image in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>g. Quantification of cell death phases was performed using the co-localisation scatter plots described previously. There was a significant (Po0.05) increase in cells in late-phase apoptosis compared with either necrosis or early-phase apoptosis <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>i). Indeed, most labelled cells were in late-phase apoptosis (Anx þ /PI þ ), with relatively few cells exhibiting the diagnostic markers of necrosis (PI þ ) or early-phase apoptosis (Anx þ ). This distribution of dying cells is broadly similar to that seen in both the SSP and Ab models <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>k) at the time of peak apoptosis.</p>
            <p>These findings show that PMA stimulates a higher rate of early-phase apoptosis (annexin V staining alone) in 3xTg-AD animals, and are consistent with the data in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> showing a similar effect of PMA in the model of acute RGC death mediated by Ab.To assess the magnitude of late apoptosis, we studied the co-localisation of PI and annexin V using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="facbd4c108-software-simple-3">ImageJ</rs> software with the Intensity Correlation Analysis plugin. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> (c, d) Scatter plots show the distribution of annexin and PI fluorescence intensity in the eyes shown in <ref type="figure">(a, b)</ref>, Ab alone (c) and Ab þ MK801 (d). (e) Thresholds were set automatically by the plugin for each analysis (colour overlay in (c, d)), and quantification of each cell death phase was performed from generated data (e). MK801 treatment reduced the overall levels of cell death (blue, total), mostly by reducing the number of cells in late-phase apoptosis (yellow, Anx þ /PI þ ) and necrosis (red, PI þ ).</p>
            <p>Imaging. All rats had in vivo retinal imaging performed at regular and set intervals after experimental treatment using a prototype Zeiss cSLO, as previously described. <ref type="bibr">1,11</ref> Imaging was performed under general anaesthesia with animals being held in a stereotaxic frame, with their pupils dilated. Different lasers and filters were used for different fluorochromes: for excitation of Alexa Fluor 488, an argon laser wavelength of 488 nm and a solid state photodetector with a 521 nm cut-off filter and a 550 nm cut-on filter were used; for DiI, a diode-pumped crystal green laser with a wavelength of 532 nm was used with 550 nm cut-off and 600 nm cut-on filters; the same laser was used for PI visualisation, but with a 650 nm cut-off. The cSLO used in this study is the same as that described previously, with modifications complying with the established standards for safety and light exposure. <ref type="bibr">1,37</ref> We have developed a purpose-written software to allow optimal processing of low-light fluorescent signals, which has greatly aided our live cell imaging. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Monochrome images from each area were acquired using the appropriate laser setup and colourised. Three-colour images were produced by combining each of the grey scale images from the cSLO into the red (PI), green (annexin 488) and blue channels (DiI) of an RGB colour image. Images were processed in this way because red, green and blue (RGB) colours are universally accepted as the most informative methods for showing co-localisation. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="facbd4c108-software-simple-4">ImageJ</rs> Intensity Correlation Analysis plugin was applied to generate co-localisation scatter plots and colour thresholds. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Colour and raw scatter plots of annexin and PI fluorescence intensity were constructed; hence, the data could be analysed in a similar manner to that of the data derived by in vitro FACS analysis. Separation of the different phases of cell death according to whether they were annexin V positive (early apoptosis), annexin V and PI double positive (late apoptosis) or PI positive (necrosis) was enabled by the adoption of thresholds set automatically by the plugin for each analysis. Fluorescence intensity counts derived from raw scatter plots were used to quantify each phase of cell death.</p>
            <p>Analysis. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="facbd4c108-software-simple-5">ImageJ</rs> software was used with specific plugins to create 3D surface plots, RGB projections and to analyse co-localisation (JaCoP and Intensity Correlation Analysis). Graphical data for mean values were contrived with 95% confidence intervals, and comparisons across groups were performed using ANOVA or Student's t-test for paired eyes, with Po0.05 as the significance level.</p>

            <p>To compensate for the low fluorescence emission in a standard two-photon microscope, light at each pixel is integrated for a long period of time, but this is not possible in the living eye because of continual motion. Instead, up to 16,500 individual fluorescence frames (12 minute acquisition) were registered and added together to produce the final image. Dualimage capture and registration (custom software, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="b14056cec7-software-simple-0">DeMotion</rs> <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>), in which the motion trace of a simultaneously obtained high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reflectance image is used to register a low SNR fluorescence video, was needed <ref type="bibr">[3-5]</ref>. In addition, to compensate for the longitudinal chromatic aberration of the eye, the reflectance and two-photon excited fluorescence inputs were pre-adjusted to be focused on the same plane within the eye.</p>

When comparing two data sets, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated and paired t-tests were performed. A one-way t-test was used to compare a mean to a constant value. In addition, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the relationship between cone spacing and retinal eccentricity. Differences were deemed significant when p ≤ 0.05.</p>

Furthermore, it has been updated to miRBase v18 <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-13">Ensembl</rs> v<rs corresp="#e0f8a9f552-software-13" resp="#annotator3" type="version">69</rs> <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>.

Furthermore, a new section of the web interface hosts ready-made advanced workflows that can perform extensive miRNA-related analyses on results derived from high-throughput techniques, such as microarrays or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-13">DIANA-microT</rs> server has been updated to miRBase v18 and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-18">Ensembl</rs> v<rs corresp="#e0f8a9f552-software-18" resp="#annotator3" type="version">69</rs>. The server is compatible with the new miRNA nomenclature (3p/5p) introduced in miRBase v18, as well as with previous miRNA naming conventions. It currently supports 7.3 Â 10 6 H.sapiens, 3.5 Â 10 6 M.musculus, 4.4 Â 10 5 D.melanogaster and 2.5 Â 10 5 C.elegans interactions between 3876 miRNAs and 64 750 protein-coding genes. Gene (9) and miRNA (13) expression annotation has been incorporated into the web server, enabling the user to perform advanced result filtering based on tissue expression. Furthermore, users can also restrict predictions between uploaded lists of expressed genes and/or miRNAs. For example, this feature can be used to identify interactions between a list of repressed (or overexpressed) genes and overexpressed (or repressed) miRNAs, in the case of a differential expression analysis pipeline. Moreover, the web server hosts an updated version of the KEGG database providing a relevant search module based on KEGG pathway descriptions <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. A redesigned optional user space has also been implemented, which provides personalized features and facilitates the interconnectivity between the web server and the available <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-16">DIANA</rs> software and databases <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>).</p>
            <p>As high-throughput data have become the new backbone of biological research, there is an increasing need to support advanced high-throughput analysis pipelines. The new <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-17">DIANA-microT</rs> web server aims to facilitate users, not having access to extensive computational infrastructures and support, to perform ready-to-use sophisticated pipelines.</p>

These pipelines can be used to analyse user data derived from small scale and high-throughput experiments directly from the<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-20">DIANA-microT</rs> web server interface, without the necessity to install or implement any kind of software.</p>
            <p>The prediction score threshold can significantly affect the analysis steps that follow. In the case of predicted interactions, the pipeline can be optimized by automatic repetitions of different prediction thresholds (from sensitive to more stringent), to minimize the effect of the selected settings to the result. By using meta-analysis statistics, the server combines the P-values from each repetition into a total P-value for each miRNA, signifying its effect on the selected genes for all used thresholds <ref type="bibr">(15,16)</ref>. In the last step of the pipeline, the identified miRNAs are subjected to a functional analysis, where pathways controlled by the combined action of these miRNAs are detected using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-27">DIANA-miRPath</rs> v<rs corresp="#e0f8a9f552-software-27" resp="#annotator3" type="version">2.1</rs> <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Small villages (having less than 1,000 inhabitants) are merged with adjacent villages that are more similar in terms of adult education and economic status. After merging the small villages, we are left with 90 villages (or clusters) for analysis. GIS of the HDSS generates spatial data: geo-coordinates of each bari (group of households that share a common yard and whose heads are usually related by blood) and land marks (tube-wells, health facilities, schools, markets, mosques and temples) in degree decimal format. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="ba8a29bc3c-software-simple-0">ArcGIS</rs> software is used to create a polygon of each village and to pick the centroid (defined by the centre of gravity). In case of centroidsKulldorff et al. <ref type="bibr">(5, 6)</ref> have extended the spatial scan statistic into a spaceÁtime scan statistic to identify spatial and temporal units with high mortality risks. In this study, we used Kulldorff's spaceÁtime scan statistic, which takes into consideration spatial and temporal distributions of the population as follows. The window imposed on the HDSS area is cylindrical with a circular geographic base and with height corresponding to time. The centre of the base is one of several possible centroids located throughout the HDSS area and the height reflects any possible time interval. The cylindrical window is then moved in space and time and it allows the centre of the circular geographic base to move across the HDSS villages. For any given position of the centre, the radius of the circular base changes continuously so that it can take any value between zero and an upper limit of 50% of the total population. A village is captured if it lies in the circular base. Therefore, the circular base is able to include a different set of neighbouring villages. This scanning was applied to HDSS data for the time window 1998Á2007 to scan for space and time with high mortality rates.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="ba8a29bc3c-software-simple-1">SaTScan</rs> TM option 'purely temporal analysis' showed a significantly higher mortality in 1998Á2002 compared to 2003Á2007 <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>). An alternative analysis using Poisson regression showed a highly significant (pB 0.001) linear mortality decline over the full period 1998Á 2007.</p>
            <p>Identifying clusters with high mortality risks is a first step in prioritising areas for analysis of cause and planning of remedial actions. SpaceÁtime analysis using Kulldorff's method (6) identified two clusters of villages with high mortality risks in 1998Á2002. This reveals that mortalitydecline was faster in the high-risk clusters than in the average-risk cluster and achieved equity. A common drawback of Kulldorff's method is that clusters are defined as circles or cylindrical windows with circular base (5, 6). Actual clusters (or villages) are irregular in shape. This feature has some implications for the interpretation of the results. If a village with low mortality is surrounded by villages with high mortality, it is included in the cluster although some characteristics of the village are different from other villages. If clustering of mortality is, say, along the river, then a circular shape is not appropriate to detect it. The first limitation is similar to that of the control trial cohort, and the overall effect on the result would be small. The second limitation can be minimised by viewing an<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="ba8a29bc3c-software-simple-2">ArcGIS</rs> map. Each high-risk cluster comprises a set of adjacent villages. The most likely mortality cluster consists of 22 villages adjacent to each other. They are in close proximity of the big river, the 'Meghna', and are exposed to more natural disasters such as river erosion and monsoon flooding. The secondary cluster consists of 18 villages on the banks of the rivers Gumti and Dhonogoha and in adjacent low-lying areas. These villages are remote Á far away from the sub-district town and health facility. What causes difference in mortality between clusters demands in-depth study.</p>

            <p>Identification of Recent Substitutions. We are interested in substitutions that occurred in the reference species since its divergence from the last common ancestor with the comparison species-for example, on the human lineage after its last common ancestor with chimpanzee. These branches of interest are indicated in red in figure 1. After filtering the alignments as described above, we fit a contextdependent dinucleotide phylogenetic model to the alignments for each chromosome using maximum likelihood. We used the general unrestricted dinucleotide model with strand symmetry (U2S) <ref type="bibr">(Siepel and Haussler 2004)</ref>.

The fi lters were mounted in Ussing chambers stirred with gas lifts in 100% O 2 at 37 ° C, and voltage/ current clamped using Ag/AgCl electrodes bridged by 3 M KCl/3% agar pipettes. The standard Ringer solution used at baseline contained (in mM): 150 NaCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 glucose, and 10 Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4.

Interestingly, our method of modeling the intrapore charge and the permeating ions as fi xed and mobile spheres, similar to the approach by <ref type="bibr">Eisenman (1962)</ref>, has yielded the fi rst example of a Brownian dynamics model that can distinguish clearly between the permeabilities of the different alkali metal cations. In this model, consistent with experimental suggestion of dehydrated permeating cations, different alkali metal cations are assumed to be fully dehydrated (for simplifi cation) and distinguished by their bare ion sizes and diffusivities. Ions having a smaller radius can approach the charge on D65 more closely, as well as giving it access to a larger accessible volume (entropic effects, i.e., excluded volume effect) in the selectivity fi lter. This increases the ion occupancy of the selectivity fi lter for smaller ions, and thus increases the permeability for smaller ions (see further discussion in the online supplemental material).</p>

A Si (111) double-crystal monochromator was used to reduce harmonic component of the monochrome beam. All the samples were measured in fluorescence mode.

The exchange-correlation energy and potential were described selfconsistently within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PW91). The selfconsistent PW91 density was determined by iterative diagonalization of the Kohn2Sham Hamiltonian. The wave functions were expanded with the plane wave, and the ultra-soft pseudo-potential method was used to reduce the number of plane waves. Plane waves were used as a basis set with an energy cutoff of 340 eV .The electron density was approximated using a multipolar expansion up to hexadecapole. Typical overbinding associated with local density functionals was rectified through the use of the gradient-corrected Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. The Brillouin-zone integration was performed using a 2 3 2 3 2 Monkhorst-Pack (MP) grid. The STM images were simulated using the Tersoff-Hamann approach with a bias voltage of 2 V.</p>

The most abundant protein bands were cut and treated as previously described. <ref type="bibr">29,30</ref> Briefly, each band was de-stained by washing in acetonitrile and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Then, cysteine residues of the proteins were reduced in 10 mM dithiothreitol for 1 hour at 57°C, and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide for 45 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Proteins were in situ digested using Porcine Trypsin Sequencing Grade (Promega Corporation, Fitchburg, WI, USA) overnight at 37°C at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50. The next day, the supernatant was collected and larger peptides were extracted by adding acetonitrile to the bands. Enzyme activity was stopped by adding 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were recovered from the supernatant after centrifugation at 18,000× g for 10 minutes. The resulting peptides were extracted and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</p>
            <p>We used a NanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) coupled inline with a Synapt HDMS (G1) mass spectrometer with an electrospray source to analyze proteins. The liquid chromatography system consisted of a 180 μm ×20 mm Symmetry C18 (5 μm particle) trapping column, and a 75 μm ×250 mm BEH130 C18 (1.7 μm particle) analytical column.

Only proteins with a minimum of two peptides, 95% confidence interval, precursor ion mass error tolerance #5 ppm, and fragmention mass tolerance #15 ppm were considered. The following criteria were used in the database search strategy: one trypsin missed cleavage was also allowed, together with oxidation of methionines as variable modification. The only allowed fixed modification was, instead, the carbamidomethylation of cysteines. Quantitative values were normalized using 100 fmol/sample of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase as internal standard and analyzed with the Identity E algorithm.</p>
            <p>To evaluate cellular uptake of liposomes by flow cyto metry, 200,000 cells/well were seeded in a twelve-well tissue culture plate. After 24 hours of cell culture expansion, cells were incubated in serum-free conditions with 0.15 mM of rhodamine-labeled bare liposomes and rhodamine-labeled liposome-PC complexes. Incubation occurred for 3 hours at 37°C. After treatment, the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline, harvested using trypsin, and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1,500 rpm. A solution of trypan blue (0.01%) was added to the tubes before acquisition to quench the surface fluorescence. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> The analysis was performed using a Becton Dickinson LSR II instrument equipped with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="fac4e9a715-software-simple-11">Diva</rs> software.

            <p>We shed light on the impact of the PC first on particleparticle and then on particle-cell interactions. Our observations suggest that to predict the fate of a NP in vivo, one must not only know the PC composition and eventually the orientation of proteins, but should also carefully consider the physical changes (size, surface, and charge) that the NP undergoes when surrounded by a PC and the consequent impact on particle-particle interactions. This studyshows that the efficacy of liposomal formulations must be reinterpreted, as it is strongly affected by PC formation in plasma. Classical characterization of nanodelivery systems should include studies on PC formation and be combined with experiments that simulate the tendency of NPs to aggregate after exposure to plasma proteins. We believe that such studies will hopefully help us interpret and predict in vivo data and to design more effective therapeutic carriers. Using offline <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="fac4e9a715-software-simple-12">Nanoscope</rs> software, the liposome was magnified further, and then a section analysis was performed. Along the whole particle profile, there are regions at different heights (differences =5 nm). Abbreviations: aFM, atomic force microscopy; Pc, protein corona.</p>

            <p>Estimates of the number of persons living with HIV have been the major focus of routine monitoring and reporting on HIV epidemics. However, a number of problems have been identified with the reliance on prevalence as an indicator for analysing the impact of HIV programs. During the early phases of an epidemic prevalence grows rapidly, but changes in the slope due to saturation and to program impact are difficult to separate. After several years HIV prevalence tends to plateau, with new infections and deaths balancing each other out. An effective program introduced as this plateau phase begins may induce a gradual decline in prevalence, but this decline may be difficult to distinguish from mortality-related declines. Several years ago, the global epidemic entered a plateau phase, with most countries in sub-Saharan Africadwhere the majority of people living with HIV residedshowing stable or only slowly declining HIV prevalence. As a result, in 2007 UNAIDS began to focus more attention on new infections, that is, incidence, as a more informative measure of global progress. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> In response, the UNAIDS Reference Group recommended that the tools UNAIDS prepares to assist countries in analysing their epidemics, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="cc5f38258d-software-simple-0">EPP</rs> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator27" type="software" xml:id="cc5f38258d-software-0">Spectrum</rs>, shift to a focus on incidence. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> This change was made in the <rs corresp="#cc5f38258d-software-0" resp="#curator" type="version">2009</rs> version of the software, which still fits prevalence data, but provides incidence from the model along with prevalence as outputs. Because incidence is derived by fitting prevalence, it reflects an averaged national trend in new infections and may not capture short-term rises and falls in incidence occurring in specific groups or geographical areas.</p>

            <p>For each methylated and unmethylated amplicon 300 ng of PCR product was vacuum dried and resuspended in 33 ml of water with 2.5· random primer buffer (BioPrime Labeling Kit; Invitrogen) together with 0.5 ng of control Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA (synthesized from pARAB obtained from the Microarray Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada) and denatured at 95 C for 5 min. Each denatured sample was placed on ice with 7.5 ml of 10· dNTP mixture (2 mM each of dATP, dCTP and dGTP, and 0.35 mM dTTP), 1.8 ml of 10 mM aminoallyl-dUTP together with 80 U Klenow Fragment and incubated at 37 C for 2 h then stopped with 5 ml of stop buffer (BioPrime Kit). The total volume was increased to 425 ml with water and unincorporated aminoallyl-dUTP was removed by two centrifugations at 10 000 r.p.m. using a Microcon YM30 concentrator (Millipore). Purified sample was collected by centrifuging the inverted column at 4500 r.p.m. for 5 min and then vacuum dried. Each sample was reconstituted in 4.5 ml of water together with 4.5 ml Cy dye (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech)in 0.1M sodium bicarbonate titrated with sodium hydroxide to pH 9.0. The mixture was held at room temperature in the dark for 1.5 h and the coupling reaction was stopped by adding 4.5 ml of 4M hydroxylamine and 35 ml of 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Labelled DNA was purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification column and then vacuum dried. Both dye-coupled DNAs were then resuspended together in 85 ml of DIG Easy Hyb solution (Roche Diagnostics) together with 5 ml of salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml) and denatured at 95 C for 5 min. The hybridization mixture was allowed to cool briefly and 5 ml of yeast tRNA (10 mg/ml) was added and the mixture was held at 65 C for 2 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. Hybridization to the microarray was carried out under a cover slip in a humidified chamber at 37 C for 8 h. The cover slip was floated off in 1· SSC and each slide was washed three times in 1· SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 C for 15 min followed by removal of SDS at room temperature in 1· SSC and 0.1· SSC for 5 min each. The slides were dried by centrifugation at 500 r.p.m. for 5 min and scanned immediately using the GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon). The settings for PMT gain were adjusted during the initial rapid scan to achieve a balance between the two channels and these settings were used for the high resolution scan. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="dbf01250c9-software-7">GenePix</rs> version <rs corresp="#dbf01250c9-software-7" resp="#annotator5" type="version">4.1</rs> was used to perform image analysis and feature segmentation.</p>

Mutation-scaled population sizes (y) were calculated using the number of sampled alleles <ref type="bibr">(Haasl and Payseur, 2010)</ref>. We employed a Brownian motion allele mutation model with starting estimates of the mutation-scaled migration rate derived from F ST calculations to estimate all possible migration routes. Chains of one million steps with a burnin of 50 000 were run with 10 replicates, sampling every 100 steps <ref type="bibr">(Beerli, 2009</ref>). The analysis was run in parallel on the NeSI pan cluster at the University of Auckland.</p>
            <p>Testing for ecological drivers of population structure Only four different genotypes were derived from native fruits and soil, and 21 from vineyard soil (Supplementary S1 and S2). This translates to low statistical power to test how the niche of isolation affects population structure. Despite this, observations of identical genotypes between niches within, but not between, regions are striking. For example, genotypes recovered from native soil and fruit in the Martinborough region (Waiohine Gorge) were identical to spontaneous ferment isolates recovered 20 km away in Martinborough vineyards but were not found in other NZ regions; three of the genotypes isolated from vineyard soil in the Wairau Valley were identical to isolates from spontaneous ferments sourced in the same region, with one of these vineyard soil genotypes being identical to an isolate from the spontaneous ferment from the same vineyard. F ST values between environmental samples (from native soil and fruit and vineyard soil) and spontaneous ferment samples within regions are extremely low (o0.005) and insignificant <ref type="bibr">(P40.33)</ref> with the exception of Martinborough (F ST ¼ 0.046, P ¼ 0.003); however, this F ST value is classed as only representing 'low' differentiation <ref type="bibr">(Wright, 1978)</ref>. There is complete overlap of isolates deriving from all niches in a principal component analysis of genetic distances between genotypes (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>) and no significant population differentiation between niches within regions using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-8">InStruct</rs> and subsequent <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-9">ObStruct</rs> analyses (P40.119, <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S2)</ref>. Together, this provides no substantial evidence of an effect of niche on population structure within regions. Some of the S. cerevisiae genotypes contributing to spontaneous ferments may have derived from wineries, as opposed to the 'environment' <ref type="bibr">(Bokulich et al., 2013)</ref>. As all of these wineries reside within the same geographic regions the fruit was collected from, these potentially winery derived genotypes form part of the local population we wish to study. Thus, individuals from various niches within regions comprise homogenous populations, and so we combined all genotypes from different niches within regions to form regional populations for further analyses.</p>
            <p>Quantifying geographic population structure <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-10">InStruct</rs> analyses <ref type="bibr">(Gao et al., 2007)</ref> indicate the optimal number of populations, given the data are 16. Examination of the ancestry profile plots <ref type="bibr">(Rosenberg, 2004)</ref> resulting from this analysis are indicative of population structure by region to some degree (for example, the blocks of green, red and yellow in Nelson, Central Otago and Martinborough, respectively) and are in agreement with the magnitude of the pairwise F ST estimates <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). Subsequent <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-11">ObStruct</rs> analyses revealed that the inferred population structure is significantly correlated with geographic location (R 2 ¼ 0.16, Po0.0001), and this explains about one-sixth of the genetic variability observed. Individuals from the Nelson and Central Otago regions contributed the greatest signal to overall population structure with significant decreases in the R 2 values observed when these are removed (R 2 ¼ D À 0.05 and D À 0.02, respectively). The R 2 value remained constant when data from Martinborough were removed but increased when Hawke's Bay and Marlborough data were independently removed (R 2 ¼ D þ 0.03 for both). Increases in R 2 suggest individuals from these regions add noise to any signal for structure (that is, have homogenised not localised populations). Further, canonical discriminant analysis shows that B80% of the variation in ancestry profiles can be represented with the first and second axes, suggesting that most of the variation can be visualised in these graphical representations of the data (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S3</ref>). Ancestry profiles from Central Otago and Nelson cluster the most discretely in these plots,The number of individuals included in the final analysis after the collapsing of identical individuals because of clonal expansion. b The estimated number of genotypes in the population by rarefaction with 95% upper and lower rarefaction limit calculated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-11">EstimateS</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Colwell, 2006)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Quantifying population connectivity and migration Pairwise estimates of migration between the regions (Nm values) using classic methods derived from F ST values <ref type="bibr">(Hartl and Clark, 1997)</ref> suggest that Hawke's Bay and Marlborough are the most connected, closely followed by Marlborough and Martinborough, and Hawke's Bay and Martinborough <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). Nelson and Central Otago share the lowest number of migrants with an estimate of just one per generation <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-13">MIGRATE</rs> analyses showed an acceptance ratio for each parameter ranging from 0.38 to 0.65, and an effective sample size of approximately two million, suggesting that the chain length was sufficient. The autocorrelation between parameters and the prior was high and estimated to be around 0.96 overall, indicating a lack of information in data. This is reflected in the high confidence intervals surrounding the estimates (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S4)</ref>. However, consistent patterns between multiple runs were evident, allowing meaningful estimates of gene flow between regions to be made. Inferred mean rates of movement between regions span an order of magnitude ranging from 6 to 63 migrants per generation <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref> and Supplementary Table S4), and show differential inward and outward movements for some regions. Correlating with the classic Nm estimates, and the analyses of population structure, Nelson and Central Otago show greatest isolation with twofold greater rates of outward than inward migration, and show an average of just 51 inward migrants per generation, 3.2-fold less than the overall average inward migration rate of 164 migrants per generation for all other regions <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref> and Supplementary Table S4). Conversely, Marlborough and the Hawke's Bay, which harbours some of the least distinctive and most diverse populations, experience some of the greatest inward migration rates at an average of 171 migrants per generation, 1.4-fold more than the average inward migration rate (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>). In line with the low F ST estimates, a high degree of individuals with shared ancestry from <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-14">InStruct</rs>, and a large proportion of admixed individuals <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>), Marlborough and the Hawke's Bay are the most connected regions, and experience an average of twofold more migration between these regions than the average overall migration rate. The extent of migration between regions does not correlate with geographic location (P40.21) showing the difference in the extent of gene flow is not simply a function of distance.</p>

In the analysis of the results obtained, the following statistical methods were used: for continuous variables in the study as the first analysis of symmetry (normality) of their distribution by Kolmogornov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk test. Since the distribution of continuous variables significantly deviated from normal (Gaussian) distribution, mean values and a measure of dispersion, for their comparison is used the median and interquartile range and nonparametric test (ANOVA), normal and ordinal variables in the study were analyzed by χ2 test and in the lack of expected frequencies used Fisher's exact test. The statistical analysis used the Pearson χ2 test for difference distribution of nominal and ordinal data. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the frequency of dysplasia (L-Sil and H-SIL) in relation to the normal cytological findings.</p>

            <p>Strain identification by MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA sequencing Among the 18 culture conditions previously selected by culturomics <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>, strain MC1 grew on sheep's blood-enriched Colombia agar (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). The colonies were obtained by spreading samples on a solid medium. They were then purified by subculture and identified by MALDI-TOF MS <ref type="bibr">[28,29]</ref>. Colonies were deposited in duplicate on a MTP 96 MALDI-TOF MS target plate (Bruker Daltonics, Leipzig, Germany), which was analysed with a Microflex spectrometer (Bruker). The 12 spectra obtained were matched against the references of the 7567 bacteria contained in the database by standard pattern matching (with default parameter settings), with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d4dd357178-software-1">MALDI BioTyper</rs> database software <rs corresp="#d4dd357178-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#d4dd357178-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bruker</rs>). An identification score over 1.9 with a validated species allows identification at the species level, and a score under 1.7 does not enable any identification. When identification by MALDI-TOF MS failed, the 16S rRNA was sequenced <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>. Stackebrandt and Ebers <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref> suggest similarity levels of 98.7% with the 16S rRNA sequence as a threshold to define a new species without performing DNA-DNA hybridization.</p>
            <p>ORFans were identified if all the performed BLASTP procedures did not give positive results (E value smaller than 1e-03 for ORFs with sequence size higher than 80 aa or E value smaller than 1e-05 for ORFs with a sequence length smaller than 80 aa). Such parameter thresholds have already been used in previous work to define ORFans. Genomes were automatically retrieved from the 16s RNA tree using <rs corresp="#d4dd357178-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Xegen</rs>'s <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d4dd357178-software-2">PhyloPattern</rs> software <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>. For each selected genome, complete genome sequence, proteome andORFeome genome sequence were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information FTP site. All proteomes were analysed with proteinOrtho <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>. Then for each couple of genomes a similarity score was computed. This score is the mean value of nucleotide similarity between all orthologue couples between the two genomes studied (AGIOS) <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. The entire proteome was annotated to define the distribution of functional classes of predicted genes according to the clusters of orthologous protein groups (using the same method as for the genome annotation). To evaluate the genomic similarity among the compared strains, we determined two parameters: digital DNA-DNA hybridization, which exhibits a high correlation with DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) <ref type="bibr">[39,40]</ref>, and AGIOS <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>, which was designed to be independent from DDH.</p>

Following the process of decalcification and dehydration, the muscles were embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-µm sections and stained using hematoxylin and eosin. Muscle fibers (≥100 in each group) were observed in bright-field using Nikon ECLIPSE TS100 light microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and Nikon D7200 image acquisition system.

To correct quantitative variations in the intensity of protein spots, spot volumes were normalized as a percentage of the total volume of all the spots present in a gel. Only spots that were consistently present in the gels from at least three rats in each group were analyzed to avoid spot differences that were due to gel-to-gel or biological variation inherent among the rats. The protein molecular weight, which ranged from 10 to 100 kDa, and the isoelectric point (pI), which ranged from 3 to 10, of each protein spot were calculated by the software using the distributions of standard markers and pI positions, respectively.</p>
            <p>Selected protein spots were excised from the gel and cut into ~1 mm 2 pieces. Samples were destained using 50% (vv) acetonitrile (ACN) and 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (100 µl, pH 8.0) for 15 min, this was repeated three times until the destaining process was complete. The gel samples were dipped into 100% ACN (30 µl, pH 8.0) for 5 min until they turned white. They were dried at room temperature and the samples were then digested using trypsin (8 µl, 0.005 mg/ml) at 37˚C for 16 h. The digested proteins (0.3 µl) coupled with 0.3 µl matrix were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) to obtain the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) with 4,600 laser intensity.

Univariate analyses included: a) assessment of the before versus after changes in the measures of reproductive hormones in the amenorrhea group and, separately, in the control group; b) comparison of baseline values between cases and controls; c) comparison of post-treatment values for cases and controls; and d) comparison of the magnitude of the before versus after change in values in cases versus controls. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to determine whether or not any of the pre-treatment measures of reproductive hormones was associated with the occurrence of amenorrhea during treatment. The two-tailed level of significance was set at 0.05.</p>

            <p>FDG-PET scanning was performed to detect orthotopic tumours. The <ref type="bibr">18</ref> F-FDG was produced and provided by Skåne University Hospital Cyclotron Unit. For PET-imaging, mice were intravenously injected with approximately 30 MBq of FDG and were imaged 1 h after administration using a preclinical PET/CT-scanner (Bioscan, USA). Mice were anaesthetised using 2-3% isofluorane and were placed in a temperature regulated animal chamber (Minerve, Bioscan, USA) with the temperature set to 37 C (Minerve multistation controller unit) during the scanning. During the acquisitions, respiration was monitored on PC (SA Instruments, Inc, USA) and anaesthesia levels were adjusted accordingly. CT scanning was performed using the X-ray exposure of 600 ms and 177 lA, and the zoom level set to medium zoom. The CT images were scanned with 180 projections/rotation, pitch 1.0 and a binning of 1:4. The CT reconstruction was performed utilizing a Butterworth filter algorithm. The PET acquisition was performed with the coincidence mode set 1-3. The PET data was acquired in list mode for 30 minutes, and reconstructed dynamically using the OSEM option and rebinning SSRB to 2D LOR with the ring difference set to 8. CT and PET images were evaluated and created using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-0">InVivoScope</rs> software (<rs corresp="#c14654bd29-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">InviCRO</rs>).</p>
            <p>Mice were anaesthetised using 2-3% isofluorane in 200 ml/ min O 2 / 200 ml/min NO 2 . Animals were restrained to an MR bed via head fixation. Breathing was monitored using a pressure sensitive pillow, temperature was monitored using a rectal probe and heating was regulated during MRI data acquisition to keep body temperature at 37 C (SA instruments, Inc, USA). MRI was performed at a field strength of 9.4 T (Agilent Technologies, USA). Respiration triggered fat suppressed fast spin echo images were acquired using a spin echo preparation (10 ms) and an echo spacing of 10 ms (acceleration factor 4, effective echo time: 27 ms, 4 averages). The repetition time was set between 800 and 950 ms depending on the breathing rate of the animal. The acquisition of the data for the 12 slices was spread over 4 respiration phases to achieve a T1-weighting corresponding to a repetition time of about 3.2-3.5 sec. Coronal and sagittal sections were acquired with an in plane resolution of 1563137 lm and a slice thickness of 1 mm, while the transversal direction was acquired with an in plane resolution of 1373137 lm. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-1">ImageJ</rs> <rs corresp="#c14654bd29-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">1.46r</rs> with a plugin provided by Agilent to import their proprietary format FDF images was used to analyse the images.</p>
            <p>Images were acquired using Olympus BX51 light microscope with CCD Olympus DP50 camera along with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-simple-4">CellA Analysis</rs> Image Processing Program. Ki67 index was calculated by automatic quantification using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-simple-5">Image Pro-Plus</rs> software as described previously. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) positive metastatic cells in liver, lungs and bone marrow were manually quantified in 1-2 entire tissue sections/mouse at 320 magnification.</p>
            <p>Cultured SK-N-BE(2)c cells, fresh tumour explants from SK-N-BE(2)c orthotopic tumours, patient tumours and PDXs were snapfrozen and stored in 280 C freezer for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis. Briefly, DNA was extracted from the cells and tissues using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the instructions. We used the Affymetrix CytoScan HD platform for SNP array analysis of cultured SK-N-BE(2)c cells, SK-N-BE(2)c tumours, PDXs and patient tumour #3. High resolution microarray analysis was performed by hybridisation of genomic DNA on arrays, using equipment and protocols as recommended by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The Affymetrix CytoScan HD chip contains approximately 2.6 million markers distributed throughout all chromosomes; of these almost 750,000 are SNPs enabling detection of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity. The practical resolution of the method is 10-50 kb for deletions and 30-150 kb for duplications; depending on the probe density of each segment. HumanCytoSNP-12 DNA Analysis BeadChip (299,140 markers 10 kb average distance) from Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used for SNP array analysis of patient tumour #1 and patient tumour #2. DNA amplification, tagging and hybridisation to the chip were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (http:// www.illumina.com). Data were analysed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-5">GenomeStudio Genotyping</rs> Module (<rs corresp="#c14654bd29-software-5" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Illumina</rs>). For exclusion of constitutional copy number polymorphisms, the Database of Genomic Variants (http://projects.tcaq.ca/variation) was used. Genomic position annotations were based on the hg19 build (http:// genome.ucsc.edu/) of the human genome sequence. Copy number variation analyses were performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-simple-8">Nexus</rs> software.</p>

            <p>BG2 cells were obtained from Drosophila Genome Resource Center (Cell line stock number, 51), and cultured according to the protocol form the provider (https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/ include/file/general_maintenance.pdf). BG2 cells with or without SP treatment were lysed in protein extraction buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 8 M Urea, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 1 mM PMSF. After sonication, protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, UK). Protein samples (100 μg each) were chemically reduced (5 mM, DTT) and alkylated (25 mM, IAA) prior to trypsin digestion. After 4-fold dilution with 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2), the protein samples were enzymatically digested using a sequencing grade trypsin at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:50 at 37°C for 16 h. Digestion reaction was stopped by the addition of 90% formic acid to a final concentration of 1%. Resulting tryptic digest peptide samples were desalted for subsequent phosphopeptide enrichment procedure. Phosphopeptides enriched with IMAC POROS 20 MC were subsequently subjected to the micro RPLC-MS/MS analysis described previously <ref type="bibr">(Choi et al., 2011)</ref>. Briefly, analyses of phosphopeptide-enriched samples were performed using Agilent 1100 Series high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a linear quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, Thermo Finnigan, USA). The resulting MS/MS spectra searched against a composite protein database containing the IPI mouse protein database (v.3.28), and its reversed complement using SEQUEST algorithm (<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="da24894043-software-simple-0">Sor- cerer system</rs>). Differential modification search options for phosphorylation modification (+80 on Ser, Thr, Tyr), and oxidation (+16 on Met), were considered in the search. 'Peptide prophet' and 'Protein prophet' scores of 90% was used to filter the search results. We applied the log2(protein ratio) from relative spectral counts (Rsc) for label free quantification <ref type="bibr">(Old et al., 2005)</ref>. RSC = log2[(n2 + f)/(n1 + f)] + log2[(t1 -n1 + f)/(t2 -n2 + f)] where, for each protein, RSC is the log2 ratio of abundance between Samples 1 and 2; n1 and n2 are spectral counts for the protein in Samples 1 and 2, respectively; t1 and t2 are total numbers of spectra over all proteins in control and SP-treated samples; and ƒ is a correction factor, set to 0.5 <ref type="bibr">(Beissbarth et al., 2004)</ref>. Ammonium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, dithiothreitol (DTT), iodoacetamide (IAA), sodium chloride, sodium orthovanadate (Na 3 VO 4 ), sodium fluoride (NaF), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), sodium β-glycerophosphate, urea and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH 4 H 2 PO 4 ) were purchased from Sigma (USA). Formic acid (FA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were obtained from Merck (Germany). HPLC grade acetonitrile (ACN), methanol and deionized water were all purchased from Fisher Science. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was obtained from Promega (USA). Aqua C18 (particle size 5 μm) reversed-phase column material was purchased from Phenomenx (USA). The IMAC POROS 20 MC was purchased from Applied Biosystems (USA).We also used the published lines UAS&gt;stop&gt;mCD8-GFP <ref type="bibr">(Yu et al., 2010)</ref>; LexAop-FLP <ref type="bibr">(Bussell et al., 2014)</ref> and UAS-mSP <ref type="bibr">(Nakayama et al., 1997)</ref> in this study. To generate CG3542-LexA and CG3542-GAL4, we performed a PCR amplification of the genomic region 5′ of the CG3542 transcriptional start site (+228 to -22) (forward primer, 5′ NNGCGGCCGCCGATAA CAGAAAATCTACCGGGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-NNTCTAGA CCCACGCTAGGAGGAACATT-3′) and cloned the product into the pENTR vector (Invitrogen). We then recombined this into the pBPnlsLexAp65Uw vector for the LexA line or the pPTGAL4(+) vector for the GAL4 line <ref type="bibr">(Pfeiffer et al., 2010)</ref>. We injected each final plasmid into embryos using standard techiniqes for insertion into a specific site on the second chromosome (VIE-72A) using phiC31-mediated recombination.</p>
            <p>We dissected ovaries in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and fixed them in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing them with PBST, we incubated them with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen, A11122) for 48 h at 4°C. After washing, we then incubated the samples for 24 h at 4°C with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:1000; Invitrogen, A11008) secondary antibody and an Alexa 555-conjugated phalloidin (1:1000; Invitrogen, A34055) to visualize actin in the muscle-rich reproductive tract. Finally, we mounted the tissues in Vectashield and imaged them with an LSM 700/Axiovert 200M confocal microscope (Zeiss). All confocal images are maximal intensity Z-projections. We performed all image processing with <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="da24894043-software-simple-1">ImageJ</rs>.</p>

            <p>Peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST) is a rare subset of soft tissue sarcomas displaying an immunophenotype consistent with that of conventional schwannomas, along with cytoplasmic melanin deposition characteristic of melanomas (3,6,7). These tumors occur most frequently at nerve roots, although other locations along the peripheral nervous system have been described <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>. Tumors originating from the bone, soft tissues, heart, mouth, esophagus, bronchus, retroperitoneum, uterine cervix, orbit, parotid gland, as well as the spinal cord, acoustic nerve, cerebellum, and sympathetic chain, have been reported <ref type="bibr">(1,9)</ref>. Statistics have revealed a 1.1:1 male: female ratio <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. The ages of those afflicted vary between 10 and 84 years <ref type="bibr">(7,9)</ref>, although the peak incidence occurs with patients in their fourth decade <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>. There have been fewerA randomization test on the log-rank statistic using 20,000 random samples revealed a dose-response association between overall survival and the Rexin-G dosage (P=0.002 for sarcoma and 0.04 for pancreas cancer). Analysis was done using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f306e32b-software-0">NCSS</rs> software (<rs corresp="#a4f306e32b-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Number Cruncher Statistical Systems</rs>, Kaysville, UT, USA). Statistical analysis was performed by a biostatistician who was not otherwise involved in the study. CA, carcinoma; cfu colony forming units; OS, overall survival. than 200 cases of PNST reported since it was first described in 1932 <ref type="bibr">(10,11)</ref>, with approximately 40 reported malignancies as of 2014 <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. To date, there have been no published cases of MPNST originating from the parotid gland. Therefore, this case is unique and worthy of report, particularly with respect to the patient's impressive response to an innovative tumor-targeted gene therapy vector, designated Rexin-G ® . To make a differential diagnosis between MPNST and spindle cell melanoma is very difficult, particularly in small biopsy specimens, due to the diverse range of tumor derivations from a Schwann cell lineage <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref> and similar histological features, including cell pleomorphisms with prominent nucleoli <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>. In the present case study, immunohistochemical staining and ultrastructural examinations proved to be useful in guiding the diagnostic process. All reported cases of MPNST, including the present patient's case, have revealed positive gene expression of HMB-45 and tyrosinase, indicative of melanocytic differentiation, but negative expression of MART-1 and S-100 protein, thereby eliminating a diagnosis of melanoma <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. Further studies for the expression of laminin, which was displayed intensely in two-thirds of the reported cases <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>, concluded that the tumor represented a Schwannian differentiation, based on the biphasic pattern (i.e. individual cell and nested) in the external lamina.</p>

            <p>Fluorescence intensity in PR was rigorously and reproducibly quantified in an unbiased manner as previously described <ref type="bibr">(63)</ref>. Individual colour channel images were taken using a Leica microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH). TIFF images were gray-scaled with image analysis software (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="af9ad5f83b-software-1">LAS AF lite</rs>; <rs corresp="#af9ad5f83b-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Leica Microsystems GmbH</rs>). Six images of each eye were analyzed at 20× magnification by a masked observer. The PR (outer nuclear layer + OS) were selectively outlined in every image, and the total fluorescence for the enclosed area was calculated in an unbiased manner using the image analysis software. The fluorescence in PR was then averaged from six images collected from separate retinal sections from each eye. We then calculated the average fluorescence of the three eyes of each experimental group.</p>
            <p>For lipofuscin fluorescence analysis, eyes were harvested from pigmented Abca4+/− and Abca4−/− mice at 3 months after AAV injection. Mice were dark-adapted over-night and sacrificed under dim red-light. For each eye, four overlapping pictures from the temporal side of three sections at different levels of the eye were taken using a Leica DM5000B microscope equipped with a TX2 filter (excitation: 560 ± 40 nm; emission: 645 ± 75) <ref type="bibr">(64- 68)</ref> and under a 20× objective. The four images for each section were then combined in a single montage used for further fluorescence analysis. Intensity of lipofuscin fluorescence (red signal) in each section was automatically calculated using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="af9ad5f83b-software-simple-2">ImageJ</rs> software and was then normalized for the length of the RPE underlying the area of fluorescence.</p>
            <p>For electron microscopy analyses eyes were harvested from albino Abca4−/− and Abca4+/+ mice at 3 months after AAV injection. Eyes were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde-2% PFA in 0.1 M PHEM buffer pH 6.9 (240 m PIPES, 100 m HEPES, 8 m MgCl2, 40 m EGTA) overnight and then rinsed in 0.1 M PHEM buffer. Eyes were then dissected under light microscope to select the tyrosinase-positive portions of the eyecups. The transduced portion of the eyecups were subsequently embedded in 12% gelatin, infused with 2.3 M sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (50 nm) were cut using a Leica Ultramicrotome EM FC7 (Leica Microsystems) and extreme care was taken to align PR connecting cilia longitudinally. To avoid bias in the attribution of morphological data to the various experimental groups, counts of lipofuscin granules were performed by a masked operator (Dr Roman Polishchuk) using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="af9ad5f83b-software-4">iTEM</rs> software (<rs corresp="#af9ad5f83b-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Olympus SYS</rs>, Hamburg, Germany).

C11-BODIPY 581/591 is able to intercalate in the phospholipids bilayer and LPO was localized by observing the changes in C11BODIPY 581/591 fluorescence.

When defining the cross sectional area of the unknown protein or protein complex, we recommend that each experiment be repeated at least three times, and the standard deviation of these triplicate measurements determined.Scale (logarithmic data transform) will compress the intensity color code, and enable the simultaneous appearance of a broad range of intensities (as opposed to the linear and square root options, with which only the most intense peaks will become visible). 5. From the toolbar panel, Use Selection Tool button. This option will activate the different selection options, and enable selection of the relevant region within the spectrum. The most precise tool is Enable Region of Interest Selections, by means of which a border may be drawn around the region of interest, thereby excluding all unnecessary data and noise peaks. Likewise, the Orthogonal and Band Selection options are useful, when the region of interest is not surrounded by redundant peaks. 6. Once the region of interest is selected, use the Accept Current Selection command to remove unnecessary information. 7.

            <p>The UPLC-ESI-MS analysis was carried out using an Waters Acquity UPLC H-Class system operated with the Empower software (Milford, MA, USA) and AccuTOF ® single-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer with an ESI operated using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="cfa546ccbc-software-1">Mass Center system</rs> version <rs corresp="#cfa546ccbc-software-1" resp="#annotator4" type="version">1.3.7b</rs> (<rs corresp="#cfa546ccbc-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">JEOL</rs>, Tokyo, Japan). The photodiode array (PDA) detector was recorded between 210-450 nm and the monitoring wavelength was set to 330 nm. The Brownlee SPP C18 column (2.1 mm×75 mm i.d., 2.7 mm, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) used was placed in a column oven set at 25°C. The KJ sample was dissolved in 15% acetonitrile to a final concentration of 30 mg/mL, filtered using a 0.2-mm PVDF filter, and then injected into the UPLC system with an injection volume of 1 mL and flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The mobile phase was composed of a linear gradient of acetonitrile in H2O acidified with acetic acid (0.1%) and run as follows: 2-5% (0-2.5 min), 5-15% (2.5-10 min), 15-20% (10-15 min), 20-50% (15-25 min), 50-100% (25-27 min), 100% (27-37 min), and 100-2% (37-38 min). The operating parameters of the mass spectrometer were set as follows. In the negative ion mode, the needle electrode was set to 2000 V; nitrogen gas was used as the nebulizer and desolvating agent at flow rates of 1 and 3 L/min, respectively; and the desolvating chamber and orifice 1 temperatures were 250 and 80°C, respectively. The atmospheric pressure interface potentials for the orifice 1, ring lens, and orifice 2 were 80, 10, 5 V, respectively. The mass scale calibration was performed using a Yokudelna calibration kit (JEOL) for ensuring accurate mass measurements while the scan range of the MS acquisition was set at m/z 100-2000.</p>

            <p>The approximately 2 kb H19 ICR (located on contig AC13548.13) lies 2 kb upstream of the H19 transcriptional unit. The 423 bp region amplified in the present study contains two of the four H19 ICR CTCF binding sites and a total of 16 CpG sites (approximately 40% of the CpGs contained within the ICR). Six CpGs of the first and five CpGs of the second CTCF binding sites (CTCF 1 and CTCF 2, respectively) were analyzed. The 284 bp Rasgrf1 ICR region amplified is located on contig AC102545.9 and contains 29 CpG sites, with the CTCF binding site spanning CpGs 20-27. A 420 bp region of the Snrpn ICR, containing 16 CpGs, was included as a control for the detection of somatic contamination in sperm DNA. ICRs were PCR amplified using a GeneAmp 2720 thermal Frontiers in Genetics | Epigenomics cycler (Applied Biosystems, Kotoku, Tokyo, Japan) in a final volume of 50 μl containing 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 × PCR Gold Buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 U AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Kotoku, Tokyo, Japan), 2 μl DNA (100 ng/μl), 10 μM of each forward (F) and reverse (R) primer according to the following conditions: 95˚C 5 min (95˚C 30 s, Ta˚C 1 min, 72˚C 1 min) for 50 cycles, 72˚C 5 min.

            <p>In a case-control study, cases and controls ideally match on all characteristics except the variable of interest. In order to consider the confounding effects of unmatched characteristics, we treated them as covariates in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Variables with P values less than 0.2 for differences between the two groups were considered to be covariates: these included age, marital status, literacy, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Results were reported as mean±standard deviation for quantitative variables and percentages for categorical variables. The groups were compared using the Student's t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test as appropriate) for categorical variables. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for OR were calculated. To decrease the effects of probable confounders, adjusted ORs were estimated when appropriate. Results for which P values were 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant.

            <p>Analysis of β-glucan synthase gene structure. The exon arrangement of the S. crispa β-glucan synthase gene was analyzed by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ece74e37d3-software-2">FGENESH</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ece74e37d3-software-2" resp="#curator" type="url">http://linux1.softberry.com</rs>/) <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref> using Coprinopsis cinerea genome as a reference.

Phylogenetic analysis with the fungal β-glucan synthases was conducted using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ece74e37d3-software-4">MEGA</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#ece74e37d3-software-4" resp="#annotator7" type="version">2.0</rs> software.</p>
            <p>Primary structure of the S. crispa β-glucan synthase gene. The DNA sequence with a size of 5,502 bp for the S. crispa β-glucan synthase gene was determined. Sequenceβ-Glucan Synthase from Sparassis crispa 169 comparison analysis of multiple fungal β-glucan synthase genes revealed that the determined sequence was incomplete, lacking approximately 400 bp at the 3' end region. The β-glucan synthase gene was analyzed by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ece74e37d3-software-simple-6">FGENESH</rs> program to predict the open reading frame using the C. cinerea genome as the reference. As a result, the β-glucan synthase gene was found to consist of 10 exon sequences separated by nine introns. The predicted size of the mRNA was 4,728 bp. The mRNA encoded a polypeptide consisting of 1,576 amino acid residues. Since mushroom β-glucan synthases of this type are generally composed of 1,6401 ,650 amino acid residues, the S. crispa β-glucan synthase in this study is estimated to be devoid of approximately 70 amino acids at its C-terminus. However, the protein regions critical for enzyme function, including the active site, are mostly contained within the 1,500 amino acid residues for fungal β-glucan synthase <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The amino acid sequence for S. crispa β-glucan synthase is estimated to carry most of the information required for the analysis of enzyme function.</p>
            <p>Fungal β-glucan synthase is an integral membrane protein, consisting of two cytosolic and two transmembrane domains <ref type="bibr">[1, 23]</ref>. Topology of S. crispa β-glucan synthase was analyzed by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ece74e37d3-software-simple-7">Phobius</rs> program to predict the functional domain regions. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>A, S. crispa β-glucan synthase was predicted to consist of 15 loops (L1~L15) and 14 transmembrane α-helices <ref type="figure">(H1~H14)</ref>. Catalytic domains C1 and C2, homologous to Fks1, were found in L1 and L9, respectively. The two domains were separated by the transmembrane domain TM1, which was shown to comprise eight transmembrane α-helices <ref type="figure">(H1~H8)</ref>. TM2, composed of six transmembrane α-helices <ref type="figure">(H7~H14)</ref>, was located at the C-terminus of the protein <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. The large loop structures L1, L9, and L11 with lengths of 367, 573, and 143 aa, respectively, were located at the cytosolic side of the membrane, implying their function in the synthesis of β-glucan. In the yeast homologue Fks1, the L9 loop was reported to play a critical role in enzyme catalysis <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>. Mutations in the core catalytic regionof the Fks1 L9 loop, ranging 830~1,050 aa, caused more than 80% reduction in catalytic activity, as shown by the mutant strains fks1-1144 (L872F, E907K, N982S) and fks1-1154 (K877N, A899S, Q977P) <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. The L9 loop of S. crispa β-glucan synthase was highly homologous to that of Fks1 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>. The amino acid residues reported to affect the catalytic activity of Fks1 were well conserved in S. crispa β-glucan synthase <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref>, shaded amino acids).</p>

            <p>• C in 0.4X SSC (3 × 3 min) and 4X SSC with 0.1% Tween20 (3 × 3 min). Immunostaining for the FLAG tag was done as described earlier in order to identify the H2AX construct expressing cells. The slides were then stained with TO-PRO-3 (Life Technologies) and confocal images with stacks of 0.3 m optical sections of at least 30 nuclei (in 2 independent experiments), were obtained using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510) at 100x magnification. The distance between the nuclear centre and the centre of the chromosome territory (centre here refers to the center of mass) was measured using <rs corresp="#bc8828b17b-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bitplane</rs> <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="bc8828b17b-software-3">Imaris</rs> software.</p>
            <p>• C in 0.4X SSC (3 × 3 min) and 4X SSC with 0.1% Tween20 (3 × 3 min). Cells were mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI. At least 100 nuclei were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope at 100x magnification and processed through the software package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="bc8828b17b-software-simple-2">IMACULAT</rs> <ref type="bibr">(76,77)</ref> for quantitation of the probe signal. One-way ANOVA and t-tests were performed.</p>
            <p>• C. Protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA assay (Pierce BCA kit) and 30 g of protein was used for immunoblotting. Western blotting of the nuclear soluble (NS) and the CP fractions was done by separating the proteins on a SDS PAGE gel (8% resolving gel for NM1, INO80, ALDHIAI and 15% resolving gel for H2AX, FLAG, actin) and blotting onto PVDF membrane. The membrane was then probed with antibodies for Nuclear myosin1␤ [for detecting <ref type="bibr">NM1]</ref> (Sigma-Aldrich), actin (Sigma-Aldrich), ␣-Tubulin (SigmaAldrich), FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), INO80 (Abcam), ALD-HIAI (Abcam), Rad51 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), H2AX (Abcam), GSK3␤ (Cell Signaling) or PhosphoSer9GSK3␤ (Cell Signaling) as mentioned in the figure legends. NM1, <ref type="bibr">INO80</ref> or actin levels in the nuclear fractions were quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="bc8828b17b-software-simple-3">ImageJ</rs> software, by normalizing the Western blot band intensity with the total coomassie protein load intensity (after subtracting the equivalent background of the blank) for the fraction and plotted as fold change. Total coomassie protein load was used as a loading control <ref type="bibr">(79- 81)</ref> instead of conventional loading controls such as actin, tubulin because we observed changes in actin (Supplementary Figure S4: Panel E) and tubulin levels in the nuclear fractions upon DNA damage. Because of this observed variability, we could not use these markers as reliable loading controls. Histones also could not be used as a loading control in the Western blots for the nuclear fractionation experiments as they showed up in only the chromatin pellet fraction and not in the nuclear soluble fraction. For whole cell lysates, ␣-tubulin was used as a loading control.</p>
            <p>As described earlier, NM1 is reported to bind to rDNA chromatin as well as Pol II promoters to participate in transcription <ref type="bibr">(69,70,73)</ref> and NM1 also mediates chromatin modifications via chromatin remodelers/modifiers such as WSTF-SNFh2, PCAF and Set1/Ash2 that make chromatin suitable for Pol I or Pol II transcription <ref type="bibr">(64,69,70)</ref>. It would be interesting to study what happens to such NM1 mediated activating chromatin modifications and NM1 binding to rDNA, Pol II promoters upon DNA damage as global transcription is known to decrease following DNA damage <ref type="bibr">(99,108-111)</ref>. Moreover, there is also a possibility that some other kind of chromatin remodeling mediated by NM1 following DNA damage could help in the CT remodeling leading to large scale CT relocation during DDR, which is an aspect that also needs further investigation. Moreover the mechanistic role of NM1 in the context of nuclear actin dur <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>. Analyses of NM1 levels in specific CTs by immuno-FISH.

            <p>In order to manage phytosanitary risks in an ever growing and increasingly dynamic import and export market, the EU 7th Framework Program funded the Quarantine Barcoding of Life project to develop a quick, reliable and accurate DNA barcodebased diagnostic tool for selected species on the EPPO A1/A2 lists and EU Council Directive 2000/29/EC (www.QBOL.org). There are currently almost 350 pest and quarantine organisms, covering bacteria, phytoplasmas, fungi, parasitic plants, insects and mites, nematodes, virus and virus-like organisms on the EPPO A1 (currently absent from the EPPO region) and A2 (locally present but controlled in the EPPO region) lists of organisms that require standardised protocols against introduction into, and spread within, the EPPO region. Under QBOL, informative loci from the selected quarantine species and their taxonomically related species were subjected to DNA barcoding from voucher specimens in order to produce reliable DNA barcode sequences that are made publicly available through an online and searchable database called <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d48df52443-software-33">Q-bank</rs> (<rs corresp="#d48df52443-software-33" resp="#curator" type="url">www.q-bank. eu</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(Bonants et al. 2010)</ref>. Within the QBOL project, the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre (Utrecht, The Netherlands), was tasked with barcoding the Mycosphaerella complex (order Capnodiales, class Dothideomycetes) on the EPPO A1/A2 lists and their taxonomically related closest sister species <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Most of the DNA used during this study were isolated from pure cultures that were either available at, or were made available to, the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands (CBS). Reference strains were either maintained in the culture collection of CBS, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan culture collection (MAFF) and/or at the LNPV -Mycologie, Malzéville, France (LNPV) <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref>. Fresh collections were made from leaves of diverse hosts by placing material in damp chambers for 1-2 d. Single conidial colonies were established from sporulating conidiomata on Petri dishes containing 2 % malt extract agar (MEA) as described earlier by <ref type="bibr">Crous et al. (1991)</ref>. Colonies were sub-cultured onto potato-dextrose agar (PDA), oatmeal agar (OA), MEA <ref type="bibr">(Crous et al. 2009b)</ref>, and pine needle agar (PNA) <ref type="bibr">(Lewis 1998)</ref>, and incubated at 25 °C under continuous near-ultraviolet light to promote sporulation. Morphological descriptions are based on slide preparations mounted in clear lactic acid from colonies sporulating on PNA. Observations were made with a Zeiss V20 Discovery stereo-microscope, and with a Zeiss Axio Imager 2 light microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination and an AxioCam MRc5 camera and software. Colony characters and pigment production were noted after 1 mo of growth on MEA, PDA and OA <ref type="bibr">(Crous et al. 2009</ref>b) incubated at 25 °C. Colony colours (surface and reverse) were rated according to the colour charts of <ref type="bibr">Rayner (1970)</ref>.

            <p>The ITS locus is the prime candidate for the primary locus. ITS has recently been proposed as one of the primary fungal barcoding loci <ref type="bibr">(Schoch et al. 2012)</ref>. ITS sequencing data is easily obtained and a good starting point to rapidly identify genera and sometimes species. If an unknown genus or species is not represented in a curated database such as <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d48df52443-software-simple-14">Q-bank</rs>, a GenBank blast could be used to supplement these curated databases. Mycology has a long history of using ITS data to identify fungal species and GenBank would thus be a good supplementary (although not completely curated) database. The use of ITS as the primary locus, and if necessary using a secondary locus following a molecular decision protocol, would be the most stable approach for a reliable identification. This is also the identification protocol as it is currently implemented in <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d48df52443-software-simple-15">Q-bank</rs>.</p>

            <p>To enhance the comparability of our findings with those from other studies, we fit 2 types of models, 1 with parental ages categorized into 6 categories: &lt;20, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40 years; and the other with parental age as a continuous variable with the odds ratio scaled to reflect a 10-year difference in age (4). Although we found the association between parental age and autism risk to be similar across the 10 sites, to adjust for potential site-to-site variability we included site dummy variables in all multivariable models. To evaluate interaction or modifying effects of each covariate and of ASD subtypes on the associations between parental age and ASD, we performed stratified analyses. We also tested interaction terms for maternal age by paternal age and 2-way and 3-way interaction terms for each parent's age by the other covariates in the regression models, but we identified no significant interactions. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator9" type="software" xml:id="fc493cc8b9-software-0">SAS</rs> version <rs corresp="#fc493cc8b9-software-0" resp="#annotator9" type="version">9.1.3</rs> software (<rs corresp="#fc493cc8b9-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute, Inc</rs>., Cary, North Carolina) was used for all statistical analyses.</p>

All of these loci were then subjected to careful manual inspections of the insertion sites, looking for only those with exact orthologous insertions according to the criteria explained below. Only 19 Alu-like, 22 LINE, and 63 LTR loci with retroposed elements present in both tarsier 1 human fulfilled these criteria <ref type="figure">Supplementary Information; Figure 2</ref>); none were found with shared elements in either strepsirrhines 1 human or tarsier 1 strepsirrhines. The diagnostic elements active at the time of thewith 104 conflict-free phylogenetic informative markers for haplorrhine the probability of supporting the wrong tree topology is less than 7.2 3 10 250 .

            <p>The membranes were exposed for 3 days to a high-density phosphor imaging screen (Bio-Rad Laboratories), which captures latent images produced by the emissions of the 125 I radioisotope. Upon laser-induced stimulation, light was emitted from the storage phosphor screen in proportion to the amount of radioactivity in the sample. Wide linear dynamic range (5 orders of magnitude) enables quantitation and visualization of both weak and strong signals in a single exposure. After digitalization of the results, the screen was exposed to extra-bright light of ImageEraser light box and reused. A laser scanning densitometer (GS-250 Molecular Imager System; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) was used to convert the radioactive signals emitted by the immunoreactive areas on the phosphor screen into digital images for subsequent densitometric analysis by the software package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="beb9cfd1cc-software-1">Phosphor Analyst</rs> (<rs corresp="#beb9cfd1cc-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bio-Rad Laboratories</rs>, Hercules, CA) <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>.

            <p>The present study describes a gentle and reproducible technique for forming EC-MSC islets that is designed to take into consideration the inherent characteristics of the various cell types involved and to take advantage of the anchorage-dependent growth of ECs and MSCs. Our data demonstrate that addition of MSCs to our composite islets enhanced the capacity of ECs to enclose the islets without compromising the functionality of the islets. Importantly, the MSCs stimulated EC sprout formation not only into the surrounding matrices, but also into the islets where intraislet capillary-like structures were formed. negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45) and were used from passage 3-9 (FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Potential EC contamination of the MSC population was assessed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) (n ϭ 3). The cells were stained for CD90 (1:100; BD Bioscience Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), the EC pan marker CD31 (1:100; Becton Dickinson), and the lectin Ulex europeaus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1, 1:100; Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, U.K.). Human dermal microvascular ECs HDMECs (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) derived from adult dermis were cultured on 1% gelatin-coated flasks in EC Growth Medium Microvascular with supplements (EC medium; PromoCell). The ECs were used from passage 3-12. Cell labeling. MSCs and ECs were labeled using CellTracker (CT) green and CT orange CMRA, respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Thymidine assay and coculture of cells. Thymidine assays were performed according to a standard proliferation protocol measuring [ 3 H]thymidine (1Ci/ml) incorporation <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>. ECs were plated in 24-well plates, with 25 ϫ 10 3 cells/well in EC medium with supplements for 24 h and then cultured in EC medium without supplements but containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum (starvation medium) for an additional 24 h (basal control) or stimulated with either VEGF-A (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, London, U.K.) in starvation medium or MSCconditioned medium (supernatant from 24-h MSC cultures in starvation medium). <ref type="bibr">[</ref> 3 H]thymidine incorporation (at 20 -24 h) was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Triplicate samples were assayed in three individual experiments. A mixture of 25 ϫ 10 3 CT green-labeled MSCs and 25 ϫ 10 3 CT orange-labeled ECs were cocultured in eight-well glass culture slides (Becton Dickinson) with EC medium and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy after 3 days. Coating of islets of Langerhans with ECs and MSCs. Islets of Langerhans (10,000 -30,000 islet equivalents) were incubated within 2-5 days after isolation with 0.5 ϫ 10 6 CT orange-labeled ECs (EC islets) or with 0.25 ϫ 10 6 CT green-labeled MSCs in combination with 0.25 ϫ 10 6 CT orange-labeled ECs (EC-MSC islets) in a total volume of 500 l. The cell suspensions were incubated at 37°C for 2-3 h in suspension culture tubes in EC medium and mixed gently twice per hour during the incubation. Thereafter, the EC islets, EC-MSC islets, and untreated control islets were cultured for up to 6 days at 37°C in EC medium or islet medium (CMRL; Invitrogen) until analyzed. The medium was changed every second day. Quantification of EC adherence was performed on EC islets and EC-MSC islets after 1 and 4 days of culture. In vitro islet survival assay and cytokine and insulin content determination. A total of 100 islets per donor (n ϭ 6) were hand picked: 50 islets were coated with 5 ϫ 10 3 MSCs and 5 ϫ 10 3 ECs, and 50 islets were untreated. All islets were cultured for 6 days in EC medium, with a medium change every second day. The number of remaining islets in the respective groups were counted after 1, 3, and 6 days of culture, and the islet number was confirmed after 6 days by dithizone staining <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Control and EC-MSC islets were collected after 6 days of culture. Total DNA (Picogreen; Invitrogen), interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6 (R&amp;D Systems, Oxford, U.K.), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (Serotec, Oxford, U.K.), tissue factor (TF) (Imubind; American Diagnostica, Stamford, CT), and insulin (Mercodia) contents were measured on a Gyrolab workstation (Gyros, Uppsala, Sweden), and the values were divided with total DNA. Four or more different islet isolations with 20 islets in each condition were analyzed. Dynamic perifusion. The functionality of the islets coated with EC-MSC and of untreated islets from the same isolation was tested at different time points after coating (at 24 h and day 3-4). EC medium was used during the first 24 h of suspension culture; thereafter, the medium was changed to islet medium with supplements <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. Islets were challenged in a dynamic perifusion system, beginning with a low glucose concentration (1.67 mmol/l) during the first 36 min, followed by a high-glucose challenge (20 mmol/l) for 42 min, then reexposure to the low glucose concentration during the last 48 min. Fractions were collected at 6-min intervals over 126 min and analyzed for insulin content using commercial ELISA kits (Mercodia Insulin ELISA; Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). The area under the curve was calculated to evaluate the insulin secretion during high glucose stimulation with subtracted basal insulin secretion. Four different islet isolations with 20 islets in each condition were analyzed. Fibrin gel in vitro angiogenesis assay. Control, EC, and EC-MSC islets were placed between two layers of fibrin gel (2.5 mg/ml fibrinogen and 2 g/ml thrombin; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After polymerization, EC medium supplemented with VEGF (30 ng/ml; Peprotech) was added. The islet preparations (n ϭ 6) were cultured for 24 h, 48 h, and 3-4 days and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Sprouts were counted manually by the same person (blinded to the composition of the islet preparation), and 4 -20 islets were counted per group in each experiment. The EC sprout length was measured using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="b02225b66c-software-3">Leica Qwin</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b02225b66c-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Leica Microsystems</rs>, Nussloch, Germany) on pictures taken on day 4 of EC and EC-MSC islets in fibrin gel. The total EC sprout length per islet was calculated for each experiment (groups of 2-10 islets, n ϭ 6). The mean total sprout length per islet for all the experiments (n ϭ 6) was then calculated. The frequencies of the various sprout types were calculated by analyzing micrographs of EC-MSC islets from the fibrin gel experiments (n ϭ 6). Immunohistochemical staining. Composite and control islets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed in PBS, and incubated in 20% sucrose/PBS overnight at 4°C, then embedded in optimal cutting temperature medium (Tissue Tech; Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands), frozen, cryosectioned, and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using guinea pig anti-human insulin (1:400; Fitzgerald Industries International, Concord, MA) followed by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit (1:1,000; Molecular Probes) or Alexa Fluor 488 -conjugated mouse anti-human CD31 (1:100; Becton Dickinson). Counterstaining was performed with DAPI (10 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Production of DsRed-expressing lentiviral particles and lentiviral vector infection of ECs. Stocks of Discosoma species-derived red fluorescent (DsRed)-expressing lentiviral vectors (Lv-DsRed) were produced by cotransfection of three plasmids, the viral core packaging construct pCMVdeltaR8.74, the VSV-G envelope protein vector pMDG.2, and the transfer vector pRRLsinPPThCMV-MCS-wpre containing DsRed cDNA (a gift of W.T. Hendriks), into human embryonic kidney 293T cells as previously described <ref type="bibr">(19,20)</ref>.</p>
            <p>HDMECs at passage 3 were seeded onto 1% gelatin-coated six-well plates (1 ϫ 10 5 cells/well; AH Diagnostics) and cultured for 48 h. Virus at a titer of 2 ϫ10 5 TU/ml Lv-DsRed was added to the subconfluent cells in combination with 2 g/ml Sequa-Brene (Sigma-Aldrich) in EC medium. The plate was spun for 60 min during the Lv-DsRed infection of the ECs, and, thereafter, additional fresh medium was added to the cells. The DsRed ECs were then used in the long-term islet culture experiments according to the previously described protocol for coating of islets. Image analysis and quantification. Coating, morphology, and sprout analyses were performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta; Carl Zeiss International, Oberkochen, Germany) and/or fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Elipse E600, Nikon TS100; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Confocal z-stack images composed of 10 pictures were merged to produce a picture for use in analyzing EC adherence. Micrographs were analyzed using<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="b02225b66c-software-0">Leica Qwin</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b02225b66c-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Leica microsystems</rs>) to determine the surface area and total sprout length. The frequency of particular types of sprout composition was calculated from pictures using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="b02225b66c-software-simple-4">Adobe Photoshop</rs> software. Quantification of islet number was accomplished by the use of a stereomicroscope (Leica Microsystems), and pictures were analyzed using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="b02225b66c-software-simple-5">Adobe Photoshop</rs> software. Ingrowth of DsRed ECs into the islets was evaluated using confocal microscopy z-stack images, visualizing ECs at a defined depth of 30 m into the islets after 3 or 6 days of culture, with a majority of samples being analyzed after 6 days. A defined distance of 30 m from the islet surface was chosen to yield good confocal resolution. The presence of ECs was scored as 0 -3, with 0 indicating the absence of ECs from the islet section and scores of 1-3 indicating a scarce (1), intermediate <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>, or abundant (3) amount of ECs present. Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means Ϯ SEM. Mean values were compared using a two-tailed Wilcoxon test for paired data, with significance set at P Յ 0.05.</p>

            <p>The primary end point hypothesis used for sample-size estimation was that combination therapy with gemcitabine and S-1 would increase the median PFS by 2 months (from 3 to 5 months) compared with gemcitabine monotherapy with a type I error probability of 5% (one-sided) and power of 80%. The required number of patients was 50 and a 5% dropout was accounted for in the sample-size calculation. The OS from randomisation was calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause or censored at the last follow-up. The PFS was calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of either disease progression or death or censored at the last follow-up. The OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and were compared between treatment arms using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The ORRs were reported as best achieved response rates. Proportions between the arms were compared using the w 2 test or Fisher's test; quantitative variables were compared using Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon test. All analyses were conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle. Two-sided P-values o0.05 were considered to be significant. The final analysis was based on follow-up information, which was collected until February 2011. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="f9b171fb54-software-0">JMP</rs> <rs corresp="#f9b171fb54-software-0" resp="#annotator4" type="version">8.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#f9b171fb54-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute Inc</rs>., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.</p>

            <p>METHODS -This is a retrospective (Institutional Review Board approved) analysis of 810 days of CSII and CGM data from nine youth with diabetes. All subjects used the Minimed Paradigm REAL Time System (Northridge, CA) for insulin delivery and CGM. Reports were downloaded using <rs corresp="#abfc2d771b-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Medtronic</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abfc2d771b-software-0">CareLink</rs> software. Afternoon snacks were identified on CGM as glucose excursions beginning between 1330 and 1700 h. A glucose excursion was considered resolved when glucose levels remained steady for Ն15 min. Glucose excursions with incomplete CGM data or CSII suspension Ͼ15 min were discarded. Glucose excursions were identified as a snack with no insulin (SNI) or a snack with insulin (SWI) as described below, and possible snacks not fitting these criteria were excluded from analysis. SNI criteria were as follows: 1) no bolus administered within Ϯ30 min of the beginning of the glucose excursion, 2) increase in glucose level Ն50 mg/dl, 3) average rate of change from baseline to peak of excursion Ն0.8 mg/dl per minute, 4) starting glucose level Ͼ80 mg/dl (to exclude treatment of hypoglycemia), and 5) determined not to be the dinner meal. Carbohydrate contents for snacks are not known for SNI.</p>

            <p>Identification of genes that respond differently to vorinostat treatment in normal and transformed fibroblasts. We identified probe sets that responded differently to vorinostat treatment in matched normal andtransformed cells (contrast probe sets) at any of the three time points (relative to time 0 h), as we hypothesized that contrast gene expression might underpin the different biological responses of donor-matched cells to vorinostat treatment. In total, 5959 contrast probe sets were identified and these were differently regulated by vorinostat in terms of either the direction (induction or repression) or the magnitude (degree of induction or repression) of the vorinostat response in BJ and BJ LTSTERas cells. Of the 5959 contrast probe sets, 2945 were equally expressed in untreated normal and tumor cells. However, 6226 of the 9240 probe sets with basal expression differences did not respond differently to vorinostat in the two cell types. These data indicated that the basal gene expression levels did not determine the capacity of genes to differently respond to vorinostat treatment in BJ and BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts. GO and pathway analyses were performed on the contrast gene list using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ed506dd278-software-simple-0">Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA)</rs> tool <ref type="figure">(Figure 3b</ref>). 'Cell Death' was the most significantly represented molecular and cellular function associated with contrast genes (false discovery rate</p>
            <p>We further analyzed the contrast responses, in particular those genes that were selectively or hyper-induced in BJ LTSTERas cells compared with BJ cells, using GO analyses and the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ed506dd278-software-simple-1">Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)</rs> tool <ref type="table">(Supplementary Tables 1-3)</ref>. Genes involved in 'induction of programmed cell death' (P ¼ 0.0130) and 'apoptotic program' (P ¼ 0.0024) were over-represented in vorinostat-treated BJ LSTRas cells compared with BJ cells <ref type="table">(Supplementary Tables 1-3)</ref>. Many genes encoding components of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway wereselectively induced in BJ LTSTERas cells. A candidate approach was subsequently undertaken to more thoroughly investigate the transcriptional regulation of apoptotic pathway components by vorinostat using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ed506dd278-software-simple-2">IPA</rs> program. Vorinostat treatment resulted in decreased expression of TNFRSF6 (FAS), TNFRSF10A (DR4/TRAILR1) and TNFRSF1A (TNFa receptor) in both normal and transformed fibroblasts <ref type="figure">(Figures 4a and b)</ref>. Only a mild tumor-selective induction of TNFRSF10B (DR5/TRAILR2) was observed. We did not observe any transcriptional modulation of genes encoding death receptor ligands in response to vorinostat in either cell type <ref type="figure">(Figures 4a and b)</ref>. Moreover, the genes encoding FADD (FADD), caspase 8 (CASP8) and BID were downregulated in BJ and BJ LTSTERas, suggesting that death receptor signaling was transcriptionally repressed by vorinostat in BJ and BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts. Collectively, the downregulation of genes encoding receptors, adaptors and proteolytic intermediaries in the death receptor pathway suggested that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway was unlikely to play a substantial role in promoting selective apoptosis of BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts.</p>
            <p>Our data suggest that pro-death gene expression changes are likely to be important for the tumor-selective effects of HDACi; however, it is not yet known whether the HDACi signatures are driven by histone hyperacetylation in the promoters of specific loci and/or if gene modulation is due to the altered activities of transcription regulators. A recent report demonstrated a correlation between vorinotatmediated induction of BMF, NOXA and BCL2L11 and histone H4 hyperacetylation within the promoter regions of these genes following HDACi treatment. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> Whether such a correlation between HDACi-mediated selective induction of gene expression and promoter histone acetylation occurs on a global scale and is the basis for the tumor cell-specific effects of these anti-cancer agents remains to be determined.In vitro cell death analysis. BJ fibroblasts (5 Â 10 4 cells) were seeded into wells of six-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Stonehouse, UK). BMEC (1 Â 10 5 cells) were seeded into 0.1% gelatin coated six-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight. Immediately prior to each experiment, spent media was replaced with fresh media and drugs/vehicles were added to working concentrations from stock solutions. At nominated time points, all floating and adherent cells (detached by trypsinization) were collected, washed with PBS, stained for viability markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial outer-membrane permeability was measured with tetramethyl-rhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE-Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) <ref type="bibr">46</ref> and DNA content determined by propidium iodide staining as previously described. <ref type="bibr">16,17</ref> Cell viability was measured by propidium iodide uptake and Annexin-V-APC staining. Briefly, cells were resuspended in annexin-V binding buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl 2 ) containing 1/200 dilution of annexin-V-APC (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and 1/100 dilution of PI citrate buffer. Cells were analyzed using LSRII and FACSCanto II flow cytometers (BD Biosciences).Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RNA was prepared from vehicle-and drug-treated cells (1 Â 10 6 ) using 1 ml TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RNA was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated, autoclaved MQH 2 O and first-strand cDNA was subsequently prepared using a random primer technique according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate using the SYBR green detection method in a 384-well plate format. Amplification and fluorescence detection was performed in a 7900 HT fast real-time PCR system with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ed506dd278-software-8">SDS</rs> v<rs corresp="#ed506dd278-software-8" resp="#annotator7" type="version">2.3</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ed506dd278-software-8" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Applied Biosystems</rs>, Grand Island, NY, USA). Initial denaturation of template and enzyme activation was performed at 95 1C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 1C for 30 s, 65 1C for 30 s. Dissociation protocols were always performed for each qRT-PCR reaction to ensure the presence of a single 'major' amplification product per well. An average Ct value for the three technical replicates was calculated for each sample. Fold-change expression of 'test' mRNA was determined relative to RPL32 expression using the 2 À DDCt method. Expression fold-change over time was plotted relative to mRNA expression at the 0 h time point.Microarray differential expression analyses. Intensities from the Affymetrix arrays were background corrected, normalized and summarized using the GC-Robust Multi-Array Analysis (GC-RMA) algorithm. <ref type="bibr">47</ref> Probe sets were defined by the default Affymetrix HG U133 plus 2.0 chip definition file. Boxplots of expression intensities and RNA degradation plots confirmed good consistent quality of the samples and the hybridizations. Microarray data are available through the Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO accession number GSE43010.</p>
            <p>Differential expression analysis of the normalized log2-expression values was performed using the <rs corresp="#ed506dd278-software-10" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bioconductor</rs> software package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ed506dd278-software-10">limma</rs>. <ref type="bibr">48</ref> All the arrays were analyzed together using a linear model. Empirical Bayes moderated t-tests were used to assess differential expression between the BJ and BJLTSTERas fibroblasts and between untreated and treated cells. <ref type="bibr">48-50</ref> Specifically, baseline differences between the cell lines were identified by comparing untreated BJ and to BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts at time 0 h. Probe sets responding to DMSO or vorinostat were identified by comparing each of the 4, 12 or 24 h time points back to untreated cells, and this was done separately for BJ and BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts. For all comparisons, probe sets were considered to be significantly differentially expressed if the fold-change exceeded 1.5 (i.e., 50% difference in expression) and the FDR was o0.05. <ref type="bibr">51</ref> Probe sets responding differently to vorinostat treatment in BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts as compared with BJ cells (i.e., contrast genes), were identified using empirical Bayes moderated F-tests. <ref type="bibr">49</ref>,50 F-tests allowed us to combine information across the three treatment time points, looking for probe-sets with differing responses at any of the times. First we used an F-test to find probe sets whose gene expression changes (from 0 h to any of 4, 12 or 24 h vorinostat treatment) were different in BJ fibroblasts compared with BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts. This test is analogous to testing for interaction in a two-way ANOVA. Second, we subtracted from this list any probe set whose expression response to vorinostat could not be distinguished from that to DMSO (the vehicle control). To do this, we used an F-test to find probe sets whose response to vorinostat relative to DMSO was different between BJ fibroblasts and BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts at any of the paired time points. Only probe sets detected by both the above F-tests were retained in the contrast list. The final contrast list contained therefore only bona fide vorinostatresponding genes. For all F-tests, probe sets were considered statistically significant if the FDR was o0.05 and at least one comparison involved in the test achieved a 1.5-fold change.</p>
            <p>GO analyses. Gene lists were tested for over-represented GO terms using the DAVID website. <ref type="bibr">52</ref> The Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 Array served as the background gene list. Only GO terms at specificity levels 4 or 5 within the directed acyclic graph hierarchy defined by the GO Consortium were included. <ref type="bibr">53</ref> The minimum hit threshold was set to 3. Over-represented GO terms were ordered by the EASE score P-value, a conservative modification of Fisher's Exact test designed to de-prioritise annotation terms containing very small numbers of genes. <ref type="bibr">54</ref> Ingenuity pathway analyses. Gene lists and log2 expression fold-changes were uploaded into the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ed506dd278-software-11">IPA</rs> tool (<rs corresp="#ed506dd278-software-11" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Ingenuity Systems</rs>, <rs corresp="#ed506dd278-software-11" resp="#annotator7" type="url">www.ingenuity.com</rs>). When more than one probe set mapped to the same gene, the probe set with the largest fold-change was used. Pathways and interaction maps were constructed using the path designer function, with expression changes overlayed onto the pathways. Gene lists were also analyzed in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ed506dd278-software-simple-11">IPA</rs> for overrepresented cellular and molecular functions and for association with disease. P-values were adjusted by the Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm to control the FDR at o5%.</p>
            <p>Connectivity map analyses. Probe sets with statistically significantly (F-test) responses to vorinostat at any time were ranked by their expression fold-change at 24 h versus 0 h, and this was performed separately for BJ and BJ LTSTERas cells. The 500 most induced and 500 most repressed probe sets were uploaded into the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ed506dd278-software-18">Connectivity Map (Cmap)</rs> v<rs corresp="#ed506dd278-software-18" resp="#annotator1" type="version">02</rs> (<rs corresp="#ed506dd278-software-18" resp="#annotator1" type="url">http://www.broad.mit.edu/cmap</rs>). <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ed506dd278-software-simple-15">Cmap</rs> ranked drug compounds with gene expression signatures similar to the uploaded gene lists on the basis of connectivity P-values and enrichment scores. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ed506dd278-software-simple-16">Cmap</rs> required Affymetrix HG U133A probe set identifiers, so the identifiers from our HG U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays were mapped back to equivalent HG 133A probe sets using the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ed506dd278-software-13">NetAffx analysis center</rs> (<rs corresp="#ed506dd278-software-13" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/ index.affx</rs>).</p>

Indicators for assessing the clinical trials were risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR). For the high-risk group, we did not find enough studies to assess clinical outcomes through RR or OR, so, we assessed the vaccine immunogenicity and analysis was performed on the response rate to the antigen. For calculating the vaccine efficacy, we used RR-1 formula (17). Moreover, publication biases of the studies were assessed via Funnel-plot with regression asymmetry test (Egger's test). Heterogeneity of the studies was assessed with Cochrane Q-test. All pooled estimates were calculated by random effect model (except the cases of no significant heterogeneity). Subgroups were determined based on four strategies for the vaccination program.</p>

            <p>There is an increasing shift in higher education from teacher-centered to more interactive, student-centered teaching concepts. This is in part due to the known limitations of traditional lectures, such as low student attention or inefficient knowledge acquisition and translation <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. To foster interactive learning and student engagement, in particular with large student numbers, audience response (AR) systems are increasingly used at educational institutions worldwide <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. AR systems typically consist of an hardware transmitter ("clicker") that is controlled by the student, a radio-frequency receiver and a computer with software to display voting results during the presentation by the instructor, e.g. as histogram of responses <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. AR systems are used in a variety of ways: to increase student interaction and attention, to promote in-class discussions, to evaluate student knowledge or as formative assessments for the lecturer to adjust teaching pace and didactics <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Recent meta-analyses in health profession education showed that AR systems are favored by the vast majority of students and likely result in improved short-term and long-term knowledge outcomes <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. However, many instructors only reluctantly use AR systems in teaching. Frequently cited reasons are high acquisition and maintenance costs, logistic efforts or technical difficulties to operate AR system with different operating systems and presenter software <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. To overcome these limitations we sought to develop a novel web-based AR system that is specifically adapted to the didactic needs and economic requirements of higher education. Here we present "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-0">OnlineTED</rs>", a novel smartphone-and web-based AR system that is free-touse, platform independent and does not require hardware clicker or additional software. Based on user evaluation data, we analyzed the strengths and limitations of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-1">OnlineTED</rs>" in comparison with a conventional AR system that is used at TUM and discuss the potential of webbased AR systems for undergraduate medical education.</p>
            <p>Programming and online database "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-2">OnlineTED</rs>" was developed and programmed by students and lecturers at TUM. Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) as server-side programming language was used to build a web-based AR system that is compatible with different operating systems. The user interface was linked to a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-3">My Structured Query Language (MySQL)</rs> database for storage and management of user accounts and data. JavaScript was used as client-side programming language for animated features, e.g. a poll countdown function. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) was implemented to ensure secure internet communication for the user.</p>
            <p>The AR system "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-25">OnlineTED</rs>" can be accessed via the openaccess website <rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-25" resp="#annotator7" type="url">http://www.OnlineTED.com</rs> (German version: http://www.OnlineTED.de). After log-on, the main page conveys information for the auditorium to participate in a poll (e.g. website URL for login, session token, quick response (QR) code). For the lecturer, the main page is the starting point to create, manage or commence polls. Flags link to the sub-pages "poll viewer" to start of a polling session, "quick poll" for spontaneous polls and "poll editor" to create or manage question sets (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). In the latter, new poll sets and questions in multiplechoice format can be created and saved via an online form (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). In addition, image (gif, jpg or png), movie (mov, avi or mpeg) or sound files (mp3, aac or wav) can be uploaded and saved with each question. Other media sources of the internet (e.g. http:// www.youtube.com/) can be directly embedded. In addition to prepared and saved questions sets, the lecturer can conduct spontaneous polls by choosing different rating scales (yes / no / undecided; very low -very high; excellent -insufficient; strongly agree -strongly disagree) from the "quick poll" options. Students can participate in the poll after log-on to the website with any internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet-PC, laptop). A poll is joined by entering a four-digit access code (session token) that is automatically generated and displayed for each session. Alternatively, students can scan a QR code with their mobile device. Upon session log-on, answer options are automatically displayed on the student devices (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>A ). After voting, the results are dynamically displayed in the presentation by the lecturer as growing histograms depicting the number and percentage of votes for each answer (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref>). Each poll question requires a bidirectional data transfer of approximately 0.03 Mbit. Based on the average connections speed of wireless Local Area Network (LAN) (54 MBits/s) or cellular mobile networks such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) (7.2 Mbit/s) <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-6">OnlineTED</rs>" enables polls with large audiences in a typical lecture hall setting.</p>
            <p>To evaluate the use of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-7">OnlineTED</rs>" in higher education, the tool was tested with undergraduate medical students and instructors in lectures (average number of participants: 200±50) and seminars (average number of participants: 22±3) of pharmacology at TUM in the winter term of 2012/13. A conventional AR system using hardware clickers (Interwrite Cricket , Scotsdale, USA) that is routinely used for teaching at TUM served as a comparison. Information on usability and user perception of the two different AR systems was solicited through a paper survey at the end of the term. A 1-to-6 rating scale was used to assess the overall rating of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-8">OnlineTED</rs>". The answer options were 1 "excellent", 2 "very good", 3 "good", 4 "fair", 5 "poor" and 6 "inadequat". For the comparison of "<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-9">Online-TED</rs>" and the conventional AR systems, survey participants were asked to select the option "superior", "equal" or "inferior" for each of the categories, respectively. Study participation was voluntary and both informed consent by the participants and approval by the ethics committee of TUM were obtained. Website statistics were tracked by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-14">Google Analytics</rs> (<rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-14" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Google</rs>, Mountain View, CA).</p>
            <p>Comparison "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-12">OnlineTED</rs>" vs. conventional AR system A conventional AR system using hardware clickers (Interwrite Cricket , Scotsdale, USA) that is routinely used for teaching at TUM served as a comparison. Interwrite Cricket consists of 2.4 Ghz band radio receiver and radio transmitters (clicker). The system can manage up to 2047 clickers per receiver. The keypad of the clicker consists of six numeric and additional true and false buttons. The clickers are powered by two AAA batteries each that last approximately 20 weeks based on typical usage. The operative range of the clickers is up to 150 feet (45.7 m) from the receivers (in free space). <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-15">Interwrite Cricket software</rs> runs on <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-14">Windows</rs>, Mac and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-15">Linux</rs> and supports the generation of multiple-choice and true/false questions with a authoring software that requires installation on the computer of the presenter (<rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-15" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.banxia.com/ prs/hardware/cricket</rs>). In contrast, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-17">OnlineTED</rs>" is a web-based AR system that utilizes internet-enabled end devices of the audience as handsets. "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-18">OnlineTED</rs>" does not require the installation of software, is fully web-based and thus can be used on any operating system.

The operative range of "<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-19">Online-TED</rs>" is not spatially limited and thus can be used for distance teaching, e.g. webinars. Sets of multiple-choice questions can be created and manage in "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-20">OnlineTED</rs>", and spontaneous polls with different rating scales (yes / no / undecided; very low -very high; excellent -insufficient; strongly agree -strongly disagree) conducted as "quick polls" options.</p>
            <p>To evaluate "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-21">OnlineTED</rs>" and compare its user acceptance with conventional AR systems, a paper-based survey was conducted with students and lecturers at TUM. 361 of 709 (51%) students participated in the survey. Of these, 203 students were in their first clinical year (third year of study) at TUM and enrolled in the course "basic pharmacology" consisting of lectures and seminars. 158 students were in the third clinical year (sixth year of study) at TUM and enrolled in the course "clinical pharmacology" thatconsisted of lectures only. The average age of the students enrolled was 23.4 (SD 3.5) years in the course "basic pharmacology" and 25.3 (SD 3.3) years in the course "clinical pharmacology". Of the lecturers, nine of ten participated in the survey. Their average age was 40.1 (SD 10.0) years.</p>
            <p>The beta-version of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-36">OnlineTED</rs>" was made available on <rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-36" resp="#curator" type="version">November 1 st , 2012</rs> at <rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-36" resp="#annotator7" type="url">http://www.OnlineTED.com</rs> (German version: http://www.OnlineTED.de). As of February 28th, 2013, the website has been accessed by 2,997 visitors with 37,696 page hits (approximately 750 visitors and 9,424 page hits per month). The overall rating of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-25">OnlineTED</rs>" by lecturers was "very good" (5 out of 10) or "excellent" (4 out of 10). The didactic benefit of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-26">OnlineTED</rs>" for teaching was considered "excellent" by 6 out of 10 and "very good" by 3 out of 10 lecturers. Free text comments by the lecturers indicated that "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-27">OnlineTED</rs>" provided a "helpful basis for in-class discussions between students and lecturer". In addition, "playful discussion of topics and clinical problems", e.g. by presenting clinical cases and questions on pharmacotherapy, drug choice and clinical management were considered a key didactic benefit of AR systems. A specific advantage of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-28">OnlineTED</rs>" was seen in the possibility to "spontaneously assess the learning and knowledge state" of the students by using the instant poll option. When asked to compare "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-29">OnlineTED</rs>" with conventional AR systems using hardware clickers, the lecturers rated "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-30">OnlineTED</rs>" superior in seven out of nine categories (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>A ). The areas with the highest advantage for lecturers were seen in time required to use the TED system for the first time, well as its flexibility (10 out of 10 and 9 out of 10, respectively). Approximately 80% (289 of 361) of the undergraduate medical students in the studied cohort at TUM indicated to own a mobile internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet-PC or iPad). Of these, the majority (92%, n=265) could access the polling session without difficulty using either wireless LAN or cellular data network during lectures or seminars. The vast majority of students (94%, n= 274) gave an overall rating for "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-31">OnlineTED</rs>" of "excellent" or "very good". "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-32">OnlineTED</rs>" was seen on par or superior in all categories when compared to conventional AR systems using hardware clickers (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4B</ref>).</p>
            <p>In this article we present "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-33">OnlineTED</rs>", a novel web-based audience response system that is free-to-use, platformindependent and does not require hardware clickers. Our aim was to develop an AR system for higher education that is on par with commercial systems with respect to functionality and usability. Surprisingly, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-34">OnlineTED</rs>" was evaluated superior in a number of categories by both students and lecturers (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). In particular, its usability and flexibility with regard to handling, question management and in-class performance were seen as key advantages of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-35">OnlineTED</rs>" in comparison to conventional AR systems. Finally, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-36">OnlineTED</rs>" is a non-commerical AR system that is freely available to educators and students worldwide. A potential limitation of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-37">OnlineTED</rs>" is its dependency on internet availability that may be limited or restricted at some university campuses due to poor WLAN coverageor cellular network reception. Another important issue is the safety of data on the internet. To address these concerns, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-38">OnlineTED</rs>" has implemented HTTPS, a communications protocol for secure communication over a computer network that is used for sensitive data transfer e.g. electronic banking. HTTPS provides bi-directional encryption of data transfer between a client and server and authentication of the web site and associated web server <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. As an additional safety measure, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-39">OnlineTED</rs>" does not permit users to identify the IP address of devices used in a poll, thus assuring the anonymity of poll participants. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to investigate the concerns and attitudes of students and lecturers to web-based technology and its impact for higher education. Extensive research on AR systems in higher education has indicated their effectiveness on different learning outcomes, such as knowledge gain, student self-confidence and positive learner reactions (reviewed by <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>). The most commonly cited benefit of AR systems are the increased student engagement through active participation. However, while AR systems provide a convenient way to improve student interactivity, it is in the end pedagogy and didactic implementation that matters. In a recent study by Smith et al. <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>, students were encouraged to discuss TED clicker questions with their classmates prior to voting. The authors demonstrated that peer discussions are effective means of active learning that resulted in significantly improved conceptual understanding when used with AR systems. In this regard, the frequently cited limitation of AR systems that not all students may be able to participate in a poll due to limited numbers of clickers or internet-enabled devices may offer the opportunity for collaborative voting and peer discussions in class. Another pedagogical aspect of AR systems, which is often overlooked, is its use in formative assessment and feedback. A recent report by Alexander et al. showed that AR systems can be successfully used to monitor the progress of students in the curriculum and allow students to compare their learning progress with other classmates <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. The omnipresence of the internet and availability of computer-based technologies open up new opportunities to actively engage students in teaching. Our survey revealed that up to 80% of undergraduate medical students at TUM posses an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet or iPad). This results is in accordance with recent studies that 60 to 80% of UK medical students own a smartphone <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Web-based AR systems such as "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-40">OnlineTED</rs>" may thus provide a feasible alternative to conventional, hardware-based AR technology in teaching and become a suitable tool to foster interactive learning and student engagement in undergraduate medical education, in particular with large audiences.</p>

The percentage of the total variation across studies was described by the I 2 statistic, which indicated the existence of significant heterogeneity when the value exceeded 50%.

            <p>The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay is frequently used in radiation biodosimetry to estimate unknown doses by correlating the rate of micronuclei (MN) per binucleated cell (BNC) in peripheral blood lymphocytes to a dose <ref type="bibr">(4,5)</ref>. The assay is traditionally performed using manual microscopy and is capable of generating accurate and reproducible dose estimations between 0.3 and 4 Gy <ref type="bibr">(6-8)</ref>. A number of studies have illustrated that linear-quadratic dose response calibration curves can be obtained using automated or semi-automated slide scoring with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-24">MNScore</rs> software module on the Metafer slide scanning platform (<rs corresp="#a93a03fd35-software-24" resp="#curator" type="publisher">MetaSystems</rs>, Germany) <ref type="bibr">(7-10)</ref>. The results of these works indicated that the overall MN frequency in these curves was reduced at higher doses (3 or 4 Gy) by a factor between one and a half and three when compared to manual slide scoring. The reduced number of MN in automated slide scoring appears to be related to the strictness of scoring criteria in image analysis that can cause MN that would be typically scored manually to be missed. For example, MN that are in very close proximity to the main nucleus may be missed by automated systems <ref type="bibr">(8,10)</ref>. This is a limitation to the sensitivity of the assay and its applicability in the low dose region; however, it is less of an issue for rapid dose estimation in the higher dose regions.</p>
            <p>The IS X is capable of capturing high-resolution images of individual cells at a rate of up to 5,000 cells per second. The new IS X -CBMN method is able to process cell samples suspended in solution and eliminates the need to create microscope slides, thereby reducing the time required for sample preparation <ref type="bibr">(17-19)</ref>. All images captured on the IS X are saved to a data file which is analyzed using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-2">Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS V R )</rs> built specifically for the IS X . Previously, we generated dose response calibration curves from 0-4 Gy <ref type="bibr">(17,19)</ref> and 0-10 Gy (18) but in both cases, while a large number of BNCs were scored (about 2,000), a reduction in MN frequency by a factor of about 5-10 was observed when compared to curves generated by automated and manual slide-scoring methods respectively. This paper describes the optimization of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-3">IDEAS</rs> analysis template for identifying and scoring BNCs and MN in the IS X -based version of the CBMN assay. In this work, we reanalyzed existing data in order to demonstrate improvements in the accuracy of identifying and separating BNCs from other cells and cellular debris, as well as improved detection of MN through the use of a newly developed MN mask. The resulting increase in MN frequency is evident in the improved dose response calibration curve in which the rate of MN per BNC is comparable in magnitude to those presented by other authors using automated slide-scoring versions of the CBMN assay. Finally the improved accuracy of the template is evidenced by the re-analysis of blinded samples to generate dose estimations to within 60.5 Gy of the delivered dose following only 5 minutes of data collection on the IS X .</p>
            <p>Blood Collection and Irradiation, the CBMN Assay and Data Collection on the IS X Blood collection, irradiation, and processing was performed previously as described by <ref type="bibr">Rodrigues et al. (17-19)</ref> and all data was saved as raw image files for analysis in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-4">IDEAS</rs> (version <rs corresp="#a93a03fd35-software-4" resp="#annotator3" type="version">6.2</rs>). For the dose response calibration curve, peripheral blood was collected with informed consent (approved by Health Canada's Research Ethics Board) from healthy, non-smoking anonymous donors (three male and three female between the ages of 27 and 48). For the blinded samples, nine blood samples were collected from five healthy anonymous donors (males between the ages of 34 and 56 years of age) in 6 mL lithium-heparinized Vacutainer V R tubes (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON) with the same health and historical radiation exposure criteria as described above. Each whole blood sample was then irradiated to a known dose between 0 and 4 Gy and blinded before culture. The doses were 0,</p>
            <p>In <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-6">IDEAS</rs>, a mask identifies pixels within a defined region of in an image. Optimized BNC and MN masks were developed by applying and combining several new and existing mask functions in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-7">IDEAS</rs> (version <rs corresp="#a93a03fd35-software-7" resp="#annotator3" type="version">6.2</rs>). The steps to create both masks are outlined below.</p>
            <p>To filter, identify and score BNCs and MN, an optimized analysis template using new features and image masks developed by Amnis V R was created in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-9">IDEAS</rs>. ToOriginal Article quantitate the gating process, separate populations containing 100 BNCs and 100 non-BNCs were selected at each dose point for one donor by manually highlighting (tagging) images from the original unfiltered population without visualizing the analysis area in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-10">IDEAS</rs>. This ensured unbiased selection of images. BNCs and non-BNCs were tagged according to the traditional scoring criteria described by Fenech et al. <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. These events (BNCs, yellow; non-BNCs, blue) were then identified on each panel in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> such that they could be tracked sequentially through the template. This allowed gate dimensions to be optimized such that no more than 10% of the BNC population was gated out in any plot and as many as possible non-BNC events were gated out. Details of the features, functions, masks and gating strategies used to optimize the data analysis template are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. To automatically count the frequency of MN within the final BNC population, the SPOT COUNT feature was applied to the newly developed MN mask and a histogram of MN frequency was generated <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref>, similar to the histograms generated in our previous work <ref type="bibr">(17,18)</ref>. Representative images are also shown to demonstrate typical events found in each bin.</p>
            <p>Six independent experiments with six different donors were carried out in a previous study to generate a dose response calibration curve <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. In the current study, the data files from that work were re-analyzed with the optimized <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-11">IDEAS</rs> template described above to demonstrate improvement in detection and scoring of BNCs and MN.</p>
            <p>However, the deviation from the average rate of MN per BNC was calculated to be only 15% on average for all donors across the dose range, compared to 26% in our previous work <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. The average rate of MN per BNC (Y) as a function of dose (D) was fitted to the following quadratic equation in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-12">Matlab</rs>: <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. These curves were plotted using the quadratic equations provided by the authors and demonstrate the variability between calibration curves using automated slidescoring based versions of the CBMN assay. In addition, <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>B demonstrates that the rate of MN per BNC has increased by a factor of about six at the 4 Gy dose, illustrating the effectiveness and accuracy of both the optimized BNC and MN masks.</p>
            <p>Figures 5C and 5D show graphical representations of the delivered dose (Gy) versus the estimated dose (Gy) (black circles) for all nine blinded samples after collecting data on the IS X for 40 and 5 min, respectively. Also plotted are the dose estimations from our previous work (19) (black squares), the ideal line with a slope of 1 where the delivered dose and the estimated dose would be equal (dashed line) as well as the 60.5 Gy lines (dotted lines). All dose estimations were determined using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-27">CABAS</rs> v<rs corresp="#a93a03fd35-software-27" resp="#annotator3" type="version">2</rs> (<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-15">Chromosome Aberration Calculation</rs> Software) (28) and the error bars represent the standard errors (SE) on the dose estimations. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>C illustrates that after 40 min of data collection, the newly optimized analysis template was able to estimate blinded doses to within 0.5 Gy of the delivered dose in all but the 0.73 Gy sample (0.59 Gy higher than the delivered dose). The error bars associated with each data point are also within the 60.5 Gy lines in all but the 0.73 Gy sample. On average, 1,873 BNCs were scored for each sample after 40 minutes of data collection. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>D illustrates that after only 5 min of data collection, optimized analysis template was able to correctly estimate more blinded samples to within 0.5 Gy of the delivered dose than was possible with the original analysis template. Seven of the nine blinded samples were estimated correctly towithin 0.5 Gy as compared to only three of the nine samples with the original analysis template. On average, 280 BNCs were scored for each sample after only 5 minutes of data collection.</p>
            <p>In several recent publications, we have introduced a newly developed method for performing the CBMN assay using imaging FCM as a dose estimation tool in radiation biodosimetry <ref type="bibr">(17-19)</ref>. In the present study, we developed a new analysis strategy using mask functions recently implemented in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-16">IDEAS</rs>, and evaluated the performance of this analysis compared to our previous approach. First, hand-tagged truth populations (BNC and non-BNC, MN, and non-MN events) were selected which allowed for the identification of features that were able to distinguish between these populations. Direct visualization of the locations of these populations <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref>) also allowed for ranges of all features to be optimized. Second, we discovered that an analysis template optimized for a single data file was, in many cases, not ideal for all conditions. By merging data collected from multiple donors at multiple dose points, the most optimized analysis template for all data files was achieved. Finally, data collected from blinded samples was used to confirm the accuracy of the optimized analysis. These strategies enabled us to substantially increase the comparability of this assay to previous published results in the literature and improve accuracy when generating dose estimations compared to our previous work. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the sequential application of bivariate plots and histograms in the analysis template and demonstrates the effectiveness with which BNCs could be separated from cellular debris and other undesired objects in the data acquired by the IS X . While identification of focused, single cells can be attained from the BF images, the addition of a DRAQ5 nuclear stain also allows apoptotic cells to be gated out based on the hallmarks of apoptosis (chromatin condensation, nuclear condensation, and increased blebbing) without the use of an additional viability dye <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>. All DRAQ5 stained BNCs were shown to fall between 1 3 10 5 AU and 1 3 10 6 AU of intensity indicating that the main nuclei show a relatively uniform uptake of DRAQ5. This result may allow for improved data collection to be obtained through the application of more stringent intensity classifiers on the IS X which would filter out more unwanted events during acquisition. Furthermore, the newly created BNC mask was able to better differentiate images with two DRAQ5 stained objects from those with zero, one or three or more DRAQ5 stained objects compared to the previous versions of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-17">IDEAS</rs> template. Several of the new features developed in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-18">IDEAS</rs> that simultaneously compare the main nuclei to one another based on circularity, size, staining intensity and symmetry, allowed BNCs to be further differentiated from other undesired events. By implementing these cell-specific parameters in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-19">IDEAS</rs> template, 99% of the tagged non-BNCs were correctly filtered from the final population on average across the dose range. In addition, 25% of the tagged BNCs eliminated with the original template were recovered and 83% of the tagged non-BNCs retained with the original template were eliminated. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> demonstrates that the optimized <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-20">IDEAS</rs> analysis template generates a dose response calibration curve that is of similar magnitude to those presented in the literature and that the dose estimations from blinded samples generated using this curve are more accurate. The rate of MN per BNC as a function of dose demonstrates some variability between donors. This variability in the CBMN assay has been well documented in the literature and Kacprzak et al. <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> showed that for five donors, the rate of MN per 1,000 BNC was relatively consistent at 0 Gy but had an approximate range of 0.2-0.6 at 5 Gy. While the variability between donors across the dose range has been reduced in this work to 15% compared to 26% in our previous analysis template <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>, the need for generating a calibration curve that is based on the rate of MN per BNC from multiple donors is demonstrated. In addition, the magnitude of the rate of MN per BNC in this work has increased by a factor of about four in comparison to our previous work, on average, across the dose range, illustrating the effectiveness of the optimized BNC and MN masks. In previous versions of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-21">IDEAS</rs> analysis template, MN close to the main nuclei and smaller MN could not be scored due to the limitations in the available masking parameters, however the optimized MN mask is now able to correctly score these events which has led to the observed improvement.</p>
            <p>In order to determine if the improvement in BNC and MN identification corresponded to an increase in accuracy when generating dose estimations, data acquired from nine samples previously irradiated and blinded <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref> were reanalyzed. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>C demonstrates that the optimized <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-22">IDEAS</rs> analysis template was able to correctly estimate eight of the nine doses to within 0.5 Gy after 40 min of data collection, with only the 0.73 Gy sample falling outside the 60.5 Gy limits. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>D illustrates the improved accuracy of the optimized analysis template and demonstrates that dose estimations for seven of the nine doses were correct to within 0.5 Gy after only 5 min of data collection. This is a significant improvement over the original analysis template which was only able to correctly estimate three of the nine doses to within 0.5 Gy following 5 min of data collection. On average, 280 BNCs were scored for each blinded sample after only 5 min of data collection, but in some cases, &lt;200 BNCs were scored. McNamee et al. have previously recommended that 200 BNCs be scored to provide reliable dose estimations <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. Furthermore, in a recent publication De Amicis et al. were able to successfully identify doses up to 4 Gy, within 0.5 Gy of the delivered dose by scoring only 100 BNCs <ref type="bibr">(30)</ref>. The results of this work are consistent with the results of De Amicis et al. and demonstrate that scoring approximately 100 BNCs was sufficient to produce accurate dose estimations between 0 and 4 Gy. Overall, this demonstrates that the new<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-23">IDEAS</rs> analysis template is able to provide dose estimations with acceptable accuracy (within 60.5 Gy) after only 5 min of data collection and in some cases, after scoring only 100 BNCs.</p>
            <p>This paper has introduced the application of new features and masks developed in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a93a03fd35-software-simple-24">IDEAS</rs> software designed specifically for improved detection of BNCs and MN in the IS X -based version of the CBMN assay with applications in radiation biodosimetry. Using these tools, an optimized data analysis template was created which more effectively identified BNCs and quadrupled the frequency of scored MN across the 0-4 Gy dose range. This new analysis method allowed for the generation of a dose response calibration curve that was similar in magnitude to those presented in the literature which were generated by automated slide scoring methods. Finally, dose estimations of blinded samples were correctly generated to within 0.5 Gy of the delivered dose following only 5 minutes of data collection on the IS X , a marked improvement over our previous work. The improved analysis template, combined with the reduction in data collection time on the IS X , will allow for increased accuracy and throughput when performing biodosimetry to estimate unknown radiation doses received by exposed individuals following large-scale radiological or nuclear emergencies.</p>

            <p>Microscopy experiments typically used 8-well microscope chambered slides and a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000 U epifluorescence microscope equipped with blue DAPI (Exciter: D360/40x, Dichroic: 400DCLP, Emitter: 460/50m), green FITC (Exciter: D360/40X, Dichroic: 400DCLP, Emitter: HQ535/50m), and deep-red Cy5 (Exciter: HQ620/60X, Dichroic: 660LP, Emitter: HQ700/75m) filters. Images were acquired using a Photometrics 512 B black and white digital camera using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="be98b1df4e-software-1">Metamorph</rs> Software V<rs corresp="#be98b1df4e-software-1" resp="#curator" type="version">6.2</rs>. Images were analyzed and prepared using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="be98b1df4e-software-0">ImageJ</rs> open source software package (available for free download at <rs corresp="#be98b1df4e-software-0" resp="#annotator25" type="url">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</rs>).</p>
            <p>Aliquots (1 mL) from separate cultures of ten different strains of bacteria (grown to OD 600 = 0.5) were centrifuged at 5000 x g for 5 minutes. The pellets were washed with and then resuspended in 1 mL of 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.3). The bacterial dispersions were added to separate glass slides and each slide sample was treated with one of four Tetra-ZnDPA probes (10 µM); 15 minutes later multiple brightfield image fields were acquired of each of the forty probe/bacteria samples. Using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="be98b1df4e-software-simple-4">ImageJ</rs> software, five digital images of each bacteria/probe sample were randomly selected; the bacterial clusters within each image field were digitally encircled as regions of interest and the average area of these clusters was calculated. For each strain of bacteria, the average cluster size induced by each of the four different probes was normalized by setting the largest observed cluster size to a relative value of 1.0. The final results listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Relative agglutination ability of molecular probes measured by Slide Agglutination Assay.</p>
            <p>All animal care and procedures were approved by the Notre Dame Institutional Advisory Committee of Animal Care. Hairless mice (strain SKH1) were anesthetized using 2-3 % v/v isoflurane before infection, probe injection, and imaging. Infection was achieved by injecting a bolus of S. aureus Xen29 (~10 8 CFU) into the left rear leg of each mouse and 50 µL of sterile growth media was injected into the right rear leg. The mice were then allowed to recover for 3 hours before intravenous injection with either Bis-SR-bZnDPA or Tetra-SR-bZnDPA (10 nmol in water) via the tail vein. Fluorescent dorsal images of the anesthetized mice were acquired for 5 s (Ex 640 ± 25, Em 732 ± 37 nm, binning 2 x 2, f/stop 2, field-of-view 125 mm), using a Xenogen IVIS Lumina that generated 16-bit TIFF format files. Region-of-interest analysis of the in vivo images was performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="be98b1df4e-software-simple-5">ImageJ</rs> software and circling the appropriate anatomical location of each mouse. The average pixel intensities of the target (T), non-target (NT), and were measured and statistical analyses of the cohort produced an average ratio for T/NT with a standard error of the mean.</p>
            <p>After imaging studies, the mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation (2-3 % v/v) and euthanized by cervical dislocation. The major organs were dissected, placed on low reflectance paper, and imaged using the same fluorescence settings described above. The biodistribution was determined by region-of-interest analysis using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="be98b1df4e-software-simple-6">ImageJ</rs> software. Free-hand shapes were drawn around each organ and mean pixel intensity values were measured. The different organs attenuate a probe's deep-red emission intensity to a slightly different degree, depending on tissue thickness and pigmentation. The biodistribution analysis in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> assumes that fluorescence from both probes in a specific organ suffer the same amount of signal attenuation and thus, the average pixel intensities reflect relative probe concentration in the organ.</p>

            <p>During the first improvement cycle, the team used several strategies to establish the internal and external validity of automated data collection. Our automated data collection method used the VistA database query utility to identify all enoxaparin, subcutaneous heparin and warfarin orders for patients meeting inclusion criteria. For patients with contraindications to anticoagulation, we queried charts for documentation of a contraindication and an order for compression devices. To establish the internal validity of ourTo measure a potential relationship between use of the new menu and change in facility performance, we applied Pearson's correlation between the proportion of cases with recommended prophylaxis ordered and the use of the new order menu.

            <p>Data analysis was performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="bf558ae4fc-software-0">Tint</rs> analysis software (<rs corresp="#bf558ae4fc-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Axona</rs>, UK). The collected waveforms from the system unit were displayed as clusters by plotting the peak-to-peak amplitude of each spike on one electrode against that on each of the other three. The clusters were isolated initially by hand. Complex spike cells with one or two firing fields were separated on the basis of spike shape, firing rate, and firing location. At least 50 spikes were isolated for each cluster. Once the cluster was isolated, a boundary of cluster was automatically generated by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="bf558ae4fc-software-1">Tint</rs> software (<rs corresp="#bf558ae4fc-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Axona</rs>, UK). Then the same boundary was applied for cluster cutting in all other trials. After the cluster cutting, firing rate maps for each cell were visualized and smoothed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="bf558ae4fc-software-simple-4">Tint</rs>, which divided the camera view arena into 64 3 64 square bins with a side length of 2.5 cm. The firing rate for a given cell in each bin indicated the spike number divided by dwell time in that bin. The firing rate maps were presented in color with a lowest firing rate (i.e., 0 Hz) in blue and the highest in red. Place field was defined as the contiguous group of pixels possessing a firing rate higher than half of the peak firing rate and covering &lt;60% of the size of the recording arena. If a place cell was identified with one or more place fields, recordings were repeated two to three time on the same day and at least once more on the second day to verify its stability. If no qualified cell activity was identified, the tetrodes were advanced 25-50 mm and rats were returned to their home cages for at least 2 h. The maximum movement of tetrodes per day was 150 mm.</p>

            <p>The participants were divided in to two groups of "stayer" (n=12) and "quitter" (n=6). "Stayers" were athletes who have practiced karate throughout the previous 18 months for three or more days a week. "Quitters" were adolescents who stopped exercising karate for at least 6 months and were not willing to start again. The "quitter" group was questioned about the reason of quitting karate. There were four choices: parental prohibition i.e., "My parents don't allow me to take karate classes anymore." personal motivation, i.e., "I am not interested in karate anymore." injury, i.e., "I was injured during training or competition"; and for other details, the adolescents were allowed to write their own reasons. In order to compare anger scores of "stayer" and "quitter" groups at the start or end of the study, independent t-test was used, and paired t-test was used to study the changes of anger score with time. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator21" type="software" xml:id="fea5ac1c41-software-0">SPSS</rs> software (version <rs corresp="#fea5ac1c41-software-0" resp="#annotator21" type="version">13</rs>) was used for data analysis; and p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

            <p>Interaction screen. We used the following set of query proteins: Cdc42, Cdc24, Bem2, Bem3, Rga1 and Rga2, Rdi1, Bem1 and Cla4. Physical and genetic interaction partners were collected from public databases (BioGRID 58 , MPACT 59 ). Physical interactions included data from affinity purification, co-crystallization, FRET, PCA, protein-peptide interaction, reconstituted complexes and two-hybrid. Genetic interactions represented synthetic growth defects, haploinsufficiencies and synthetic lethality. We only considered negative interactions from synthetic genetic array screens. Interaction partners involved in actin-related processes were grouped in four categories: actin general (actin patches or cables), early secretion (ER-toGolgi transport), late secretion (Golgi-to-plasma membrane transport) and endocytic recycling. All identified interactions are listed in Supplementary Tables S1,S2. For each query the number of interactions with members of each category were extracted. The number of unique interactions in each functional group served as a measure of the overall strength of interaction with that group and was colourcoded in a heat map (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a)</ref>.and an iXON DU-897 EMCCD camera (Andor) coupled to a Â 2 magnification ring.

            <p>Pharmacological groups were selected by using the following procedure: 1. All 89 Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) second level groups with drugs available on the Swedish market <ref type="bibr">17 18</ref> were identified. 2. In large ATC groups and ATC groups with drugs used for multiple heterogeneous indications, that is, cardiac therapy (C01), agents acting on the reninangiotensin system (C09), sex hormones (G03), urologicals (G04), analgesics (N02), psycholeptics (N05), psychoanaleptics (N06), ophthalmologicals (S01), a subdivision was done to the ATC third or fourth level to attain a more clinically relevant description of the utilisation. 3. ATC groups with less than 75% of the total sales volume in the country purchased on prescription were excluded since sex distribution was not possible to collect for those purchased over-the-counter or used in inpatient care. Volume was measured in the technical unit numbers of Defined Daily Doses (DDDs), except for eight pharmacological groups for which there were no DDDs assigned. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> For these groups, packages were used as a volume measure. Calculations of the proportion of the total volume dispensed as prescriptions in ambulatory care were based on aggregated volume data from all Swedish pharmacies. 4. For the identified ATC groups at various hierarchical levels, groups that were dispensed to less than 1% of the total Swedish population or to less than 0.4% of men or women, respectively, were excluded to avoid random variation due to small numbers. Crude and age-adjusted values were calculated. Age standardisation was performed by direct standardisation, where the Swedish population on 31 December 2009 (4 649 014 men and 4 691 668 women <ref type="bibr">19</ref>) was used as the standard population. In the calculations, 5-year age groups were used. Differences between the sexes were calculated as a risk ratio (RR) of women/men with 95% CI.

As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>A and B, according to the transcriptomics and metabolomics data of COPD rats and BJF-treated rats, we constructed two gene-metabolite networks, which were mainly related to lipid metabolism and purine metabolism. Interestingly, a number of genes and most of the metabolites were involved in lipid metabolism. Subsequently, we constructed two protein-metabolite networks based on the metabolomics and proteomics data of COPD rats and BJFtreated rats. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>C and D, we observed that the protein-metabolite networks could be divided into two primary groups: lipid metabolism and purine metabolism, and more than half of proteins and almost all of metabolites were involved in lipid metabolism.</p>

            <p>The signal intensity of lacritin bands was determined by multiplying the area of the band with the average pixel intensity to provide volume-sum intensity for each band. The signal intensity of the 12-to 15-kDa, 25-kDa, and 40-kDa bands from each individual's tear sample was quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="eafdbfbc00-software-0">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#eafdbfbc00-software-0" resp="#annotator26" type="url">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</rs>: provided in the public domain by the<rs corresp="#eafdbfbc00-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, MD, USA). The signal intensity value of each band was expressed as area pixel density. Data were expressed as the relative percentage of lacritin species by dividing the signal intensity of each lacritin species (i.e., lacritin cleaved fragment [15 kDa], lacritin monomer [26 kDa], or inactive lacritin polymers &gt;40 kDa) by the total signal intensity of all lacritin species.</p>
            <p>Images of corneal nerves were collected using the Nidek Confoscan 4 (Nidek Technologies, Fremont, CA, USA) in vivo scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 340 lens. Images were obtained from the epithelial to endothelial surface of the central cornea (460 3 345 lm). To maintain masking, each set of images was renamed before selecting the series of frames that corresponded to the subepithelial compartment and contained images of the subbasal nerve plexus. Three trained observers assessed four parameters of nerve morphology: nerve fiber density (NFD), nerve fiber length (NFL), nerve branch density (NBD), and tortuosity using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="eafdbfbc00-software-1">CC Metrics</rs>, a semiautomated nerve analysis program developed by <rs corresp="#eafdbfbc00-software-1" resp="#curator" subtype="person" type="publisher">Rayaz Malik</rs>, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>All analyses are based on readouts obtained from single eyes randomly chosen from each patient. Demographic variables, tear lacritin levels, corneal nerve morphology, and clinical measures of ocular surface disease (i.e., OSDI, Schirmer, OSS, TBUT, and CST) were compared between SS and age-matched controls. Group differences in sex and ethnicity were tested by Fisher's exact test; Schirmer score, OSDI, OSS, CST, TBUT, percent expression of tear lacritin isoforms, and features of nerve fiber morphology were examined by Wilcoxon exact test. Differences in age and total tear lacritin assessed by ELISA were compared by t-test. Correlations among variables were assessed by Spearman correlation and reported as correlation coefficients along with their corresponding P values to provide information on the strength and reliability of the correlation, respectively. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Of these measures, integer and continuous variables were summarized as mean and standard deviation (SD), categorical and binary variables as the accounted number of subjects. Western blot data were normalized by the three-component sum of lacritin species for each sample <ref type="bibr">19</ref> ; then normalized values were presented as percentages.

            <p>Currently, there exist three different predictors publicly available: <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-11">big-π</rs> (15 ) from the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-11" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Vienna</rs> (available in two versions, one for metazoa and one for protozoa), <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-12">DGPI</rs> from the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-12" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Geneva</rs> (retrieved from <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-12" resp="#curator" type="url">http://129.194.185.165/ dgpi</rs>/), and the large-scale annotator <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-1">GPI-SOM</rs> <ref type="bibr">(16 )</ref> from the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Bern</rs>. The first two also predict potential cleavage sites while the third does not. These tools target the C-terminal and N-terminal signals of protein sequences, or require verifying the presence of the N-terminal signal before submitting sequences to the predictor. This affects automatically their performance in the presence of fragmented or partial sequences, which happen to be more and more common in databases. In particular, metagenome projects generate many fragmented sequences representing only partial proteins, complicating the annotation process. Moreover, with metagenome projects, the inability to relate many of the new sequences to a specific taxonomic group does not favor the use of a group-specific tool like <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-7">big-π</rs>. Therefore, large-scale annotation tools, which are able to predict the presence of a particular motif at different levels of precision (that is, to assess each prediction in a qualitative way) with minimal information, are then needed to address this new reality, since tools that are too restrictive or specialized often lack the flexibility needed to make correct predictions. For example, a recent analysis of the P. falciparum proteome shows that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-8">big-π</rs>, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-9">DGPI</rs>, and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-10">GPI-SOM</rs> generated poor results in predicting proteins selected as biologically validated or highly probable candidates <ref type="bibr">(14 )</ref>. Accordingly, our system was designed to offer the precision of cleavage site prediction tools and the flexibility needed for a large-scale annotator in a noisy environment.</p>
            <p>We developed a system, called <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-11">FragAnchor</rs>, based on the tandem use of a neural network (NN) and a hidden Markov model (HMM). NN is used to select potential GPI-anchored sequences and HMM classifies the selected sequences by a qualitative scoring scheme. The sequences selected by NN are annotated as highly probable (Class 1), probable (Class 2), weakly probable (Class 3), or potential false positive (Class 4). HMM is also used to predict the position of the cleavage site in the sequence.</p>
            <p>In the test performed with 30 sequences of those proposed by Gilson et al <ref type="bibr">(14 )</ref> from the P. falciparum proteome, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-12">FragAnchor</rs> was able to predict 29 of them as GPI-anchored protein sequences (96.67%). However, it is interesting to note that 40% of these predictions were classified as potential false positive (Class 4).</p>
            <p>The tests with the two negative sets gave very good results as 96.80% and 93.79% of the sequences were rejected by NN, respectively, while HMM classified most of the incorrectly selected sequences as potential false positives. These examples illustrate the importance and usefulness of the qualitative scoring of the predictions of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-13">FragAnchor</rs>.</p>
            <p>The sequences of the four test sets described above were also submitted to two publicly available predictors of GPI-anchored proteins: <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-14">big-π</rs> (15 ) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-15">GPI- SOM</rs> (16 ) <ref type="table">Table 3)</ref>. We did not compare <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-16">FragAnchor</rs> with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-17">DGPI</rs> because the design of this tool makes large dataset analysis difficult. Since <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-18">big-π</rs> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-19">GPI-SOM</rs> require the use of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-20">SignalP</rs> <ref type="bibr">(18 )</ref> for the N-terminal signal peptide prediction, we included an evaluation of<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-21">FragAnchor</rs> combined with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-22">SignalP</rs> to help the comparison process. However, the use of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-23">SignalP</rs> is not required before using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-24">FragAnchor</rs>. Compared with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-25">big-π</rs>, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-26">FragAnchor</rs> is more sensitive to the GPI-anchoring pattern even if we consider only the first three classes (highly probable, probable, and weakly probable). For the first set of 121 GPI-anchored sequences, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-27">FragAnchor</rs> correctly predicted 88.43% of them (82.64% in Classes 1-3) while <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-28">big-π</rs> accepted 60.33%. For the newly analyzed P. falciparum sequences, as pointed out in Gilson et al <ref type="bibr">(14 )</ref>, most predictors failed to predict a significant number of sequences known to bear GPI anchor. In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, we can see that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-29">FragAnchor</rs> has a very high capacity of prediction with only one sequence wrongly predicted. Even when discarding the potential false positive sequences, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-30">FragAnchor</rs> recognizes more GPI-anchored sequences than <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-31">big-π</rs> does. One of the reasons of the better performance of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-32">FragAnchor</rs> is the fact that it does not need the presence of the N-terminal signal, which is not clearly detectable in 6 of the 30 P. falciparum sequences.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-33">FragAnchor</rs> shows a lower capacity of discrimination for the negative sets when compared with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-34">big-π</rs>, which is understandable due to the high stringency of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-35">big-π</rs>. However, this high stringency is accompanied by a poor capacity of prediction for the GPI anchor signal. Nonetheless, we achieved a specificity of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-36">FragAnchor</rs> comparable to that of <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-37">GPI- SOM</rs> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-38">big-π</rs>. The specificity was computed by adding the proportions of the first three classes (Table 2), for example, for the cytoplasm and nuclear proteins, it is 0.21 + 0.16 + 0.27 = 0.64. For the membrane transport proteins, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-39">FragAnchor</rs> gave more false positive predictions. However, for this set of proteins, it is possible that some of them will eventually be validated as real GPI-anchored proteins in laboratory experiments.</p>
            <p>When compared with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-40">GPI-SOM</rs>, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-41">FragAnchor</rs> is more accurate. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-42">GPI-SOM</rs> predicted fewer GPIanchored sequences from the first positive set of 121 sequences, with a prediction rate of 82.64% compared with 88.43% for <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-43">FragAnchor</rs>. It also failed to predict a significant number of the P. falciparum sequences with only 73.33% of correctly predicted GPI-anchored sequences. For the negative sets, the use of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-44">FragAnchor</rs> combined with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-45">SignalP</rs> showed that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-46">FragAnchor</rs> achieved results close to <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-47">GPI-SOM</rs> (better for the first negative set, slightly lower for the second negative set).</p>
            <p>More interestingly, the analysis of P. falciparum GPI-anchored sequences showed that a large portion of the GPI-anchored sequences (40%) fell in the potential false positive prediction, proving the usefulness of keeping those potentially wrongly predicted sequences in a specific class. An analysis of the sequences rejected by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-48">GPI-SOM</rs> showed that 50% of them were found in the potential false positive class from <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-49">FragAnchor</rs>. In addition, the analysis result of P. falciparum sequences demonstrated that 4 of the 11 biochemically validated GPI-anchored sequences did not have an N-terminal signal peptide recognized by<rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-50">SignalP</rs>. This fact confirms the effectiveness of an annotation not based on the prediction of this signal. In short, the comparison with other tools is not easy due to the uniqueness of the tandem method. However, it reveals an interesting power of prediction where, in a single run, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-51">FragAnchor</rs> can have a very low number of potential false positive predictions with a much higher number of GPI-anchored sequences predicted.</p>
            <p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we show an example of output from the tandem system (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-52">FragAnchor</rs> predictor). NN first selects a protein sequence and then HMM parses the sequence in order to predict a potential cleavage site. The first predicted anchor site for that sequence (5NTD HUMAN) is at position 549. This is the position annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. In the output, the predictor proposes a maximum of three possible anchor sites, ranked by decreasing scores.</p>
            <p>The comparison of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-53">FragAnchor</rs> with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-54">big-π</rs> and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-55">GPI- SOM</rs> shows that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-56">FragAnchor</rs> can be used at different levels of precision, allowing a more selective prediction. In addition, it offers a high level of flexibility with respect to the organism considered. Studies like the P. falciparum proteome analysis by <ref type="bibr">Gilson et al (14 )</ref>, where the available predictors failed to predict the biochemically proposed new GPI-anchored proteins, show that there is a need for a more flexible and universal predictor. The flexibility and accuracy achieved by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-57">FragAnchor</rs> offer an excellent annotator for the GPI anchor signal designed for all metagenome projects.One of the main goals of this large-scale prediction tool is to offer greater flexibility to the users. We propose a tool that offers different levels of sensitivity to the GPI anchor signal. The tests reveal that the combination of the two machine learning approaches yields very good results. The tandem system is a very general (all eukaryotes) tool for the annotation of GPI-anchored proteins on a large scale by using minimal information. It produces prediction with a qualitative annotation allowing the user to choose the strength of precision that he/she wants. The less sensitive classes may contain sequences with unusual GPI anchor signals, which can yield to new discoveries in the PTM research area.</p>
            <p>The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-64">javaNNS</rs> <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-64" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.1</rs>) developed at the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-64" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Stuttgart</rs> (<rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-64" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen. de/downloads/JavaNNS</rs>/) was used to design and train our NN predictor. The learning set for this experiment is 79 sequences from the Swiss-Prot database release 49.0 that are annotated as GPIanchored proteins, with a length of the C-terminal section to be 50 a.a., and another 79 sequences of proteins that are known not to be GPI-anchored proteins. The choice of the length of the C-terminal section was based on an analysis of Swiss-Prot GPI-anchored proteins, which showed a maximum length of 45 a.a. for the C-terminal signal. To give some flexibility to the system, we selected an input vector of 50 a.a. Since neural networks accept numerical input, and given the importance of molecular weight and hydrophobicityin the anchoring process, we encoded each amino acid with its hydropathy on the Kyte and Doolitle scale <ref type="bibr">(21 )</ref>, as well as its molecular weight. The last step is the normalization of the input vectors. We have applied a simple min-max normalization:</p>

            <p>In higher eukaryotes, genes often produce alternatively spliced transcripts (AS transcripts). Many AS events have been actively detected with high-throughput experimental methods, such as RNA-Seq and microarrays <ref type="bibr">(Hallegger et al., 2010)</ref>. However, the functions of putative proteins encoded by AS transcripts (termed 'AS isoforms') have not been experimentally analyzed in many cases. Functional annotation tools for transcripts with novel patterns of splicing are desirable to infer the functional significance of AS isoforms. There are few tools for analyzing AS isoforms translated from novel transcripts queried by users. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-4">AltAnalyze</rs> (<rs corresp="#e9c5a4565d-software-4" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www. altanalyze.org</rs>) identifies AS events using RNA-Seq or microarray data and shows how these events may affect domain composition. However, it does not provide information on the effects of AS on the 3D structures of AS isoforms. MAISTAS <ref type="bibr">(Floris et al., 2011)</ref> assesses whether user-queried AS isoforms are structurally plausible proteins, but explicit functional annotations are not provided.</p>
            <p>First, a genome contig sequence aligned to the query transcript sequence with the largest value of both length coverage and sequence identity is selected using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-2">MEGABLAST</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Altschul et al., 1997</ref>). An alignment of the query transcript and the contig sequence is performed using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-3">SPLIGN</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Kapustin et al., 2008)</ref>. <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-4">AS-EAST</rs> searches the AS-ALPS database for transcripts mapped on the same region of the contig as the query transcript. The user can select one of the transcripts as a reference transcript. Second, the protein-coding sequence (CDS) of the query transcript is predicted by identifying the longest open reading frame (ORF) or FrameDP program <ref type="bibr">(Gouzy et al., 2009)</ref>. Users can also use the ORF starting <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-5">AS-EAST</rs> <ref type="figure">Fig. 1. (a)</ref> User interface for generating query transcript data. As a reference of exon-skipped transcript sequence generation, the mapping results of RNASeq data from <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. (2008)</ref> are shown at the top of the schematic figure in the human dataset. Mapping of the RNA-Seq data was performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-6">TopHat</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(Trapnell et al., 2009</ref>) with default parameters. (b) Interaction residues obtained from 3D structure information assigned to a reference isoform. The deletion-type AS region is shown in red. Interaction residues are denoted with arrowheads in the schematic view and stick models in the 3D structure view. The ligand is shown in a space-filling model. The 3D structure is shown with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-9">Jmol</rs> (<rs corresp="#e9c5a4565d-software-9" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.jmol.org</rs>/) with the users' chosen first codon as the CDS. By comparing the genomic regions corresponding to the CDSs of a reference transcript and the query transcript, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-9">AS-EAST</rs> identifies CDSs changed through AS (termed 'AS CDSs'). The AS CDSs of a reference transcript that have no corresponding region in the query transcript are classified as deletions, and the AS CDSs of the query transcript that have no corresponding region in a reference transcript are classified as insertions.</p>
            <p>To analyze the functional effect of AS on a putative protein encoded by the query transcript (query isoform), annotations of the query isoform with functional regions are performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-10">InterProScan</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Zdobnov and Apweiler, 2001)</ref>. From the results of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-11">InterProScan</rs>, functional domains from the Pfam, Gene3D and SUPERFAMILY databases and transmembrane regions predicted with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-12">TMHMM</rs> are shown in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-13">AS-EAST</rs>. Moreover, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-14">AS-EAST</rs> annotates the query isoform using functional amino acid residue information <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref>. Amino acid residues interacting with other molecules (interaction residues) are identified from the 3D structure data of protein complexes <ref type="bibr">(Yura et al., 2006)</ref>. <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-15">AS-EAST</rs> assigns 3D structures to the query isoform with BLASTP <ref type="bibr">(Altschul et al., 1997)</ref>. <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-16">AS-EAST</rs> determines whether 3D structures are assigned to AS regions on the basis of the criteria by <ref type="bibr">Yura et al. (2006)</ref>. According to the alignment of the sequences of the reference isoform and the assigned 3D structures, interaction residues are projected to the corresponding residues in the AS regions. In the MAPK1 example, the query isoform has a protein kinase domain, according to the results of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-17">InterProScan</rs>. However, the query isoform lacks a region that has some residues constituting the ATP-binding pocket and interaction residues and is predicted to lose protein kinase activity. Therefore, the expression of the AS isoform encoded by the fourth exon-skipped transcript in human skeletal muscle might inhibit the MAP kinase signaling pathway and regulate cell proliferation/differentiation as a result.</p>

            <p>Statistical analysis. All cell proliferation assays were performed at least twice at different times. The repeated experiments gave comparable results. The comparative statistical evaluations between the different cell line conditions were performed by two-way ANOVA with treatment concentration and cell line condition as variables.

Starting from this IC 50 concentration, QGP-1 and BON-1 were continuously cultured in increasing concentrations of everolimus. The everolimus concentration was progressively doubled every 14 days during 8-10 dose doublings until a final concentration of 1 mM was reached. In parallel, clonal BON-1 and QGP-1 cells were long-term vehicle treated. The established long-term everolimus-treated cell lines (BON-1/R and QGP-1/R) were maintained in the maximally achieved everolimus concentration. No morphological changes were seen between the long-term vehicle-treated cell lines and the long-term everolimus-treated cell lines (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>. After the establishment of the long-term everolimus-treated BON-1/R and QGP-1/R, both showed a statistically significant reduced growth inhibitory response to everolimus in comparison with longterm vehicle-treated BON-1 and QGP-1 at everolimus concentrations between 10 nM and 1 mM for BON-1/R and at 1 nM and 1 mM for QGP-1/R, respectively <ref type="figure">Figure 2A and B</ref>).

            <p>For quantitative data evaluation, the median test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used. To objectify if transfusion and mortality were independent of the patient's temperature, age and GCS contingency tables were created and analysed with a χ 2 test. To compare means, Student's t test was used. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to identify whether hypothermic and transfused patients had a higher risk of mortality than the other patients in the study. Binary logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for mortality. The univariate predictors were the body temperature and transfusion. The results are given in adjusted OR (AOR) and reached statistical significance with p&lt;0.001.

            <p>Data in the text and tables were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) or medians (interquartile range) for continuous variables and percentages of the number for categorical variables. Participants were divided into quartiles on the basis of serum GGT level as follows: quartile 1, GGT &lt; 17 IU/L; quartile 2, GGT 17 to 25 IU/L; quartile 3, 25 to 40 IU/L GGT; and quartile 4, GGT ≥ 40 IU/L. The one-way ANOVA and chisquare-test were used to analyze the statistical differences among the characteristics of the participants at the baseline visit according to the quartile groups of serum GGT level. The distributions of continuous variables were evaluated, and log transformations were used in the analysis as required. For cases with incident prehypertension, the time spent at incident prehypertension was assumed to be the midpoint between the baseline visit and the visit at which prehypertension was first diagnosed. The person years were calculated as the sum of follow-up times from the baseline until the assumed time prehypertension was diagnosed or until the final examination of each individual. Compared to the lowest quartile of serum GGT, the hazards ratios (HRs) of the highest 3 quartiles of serum GGT was calculated by the Cox proportional hazard model after adjustment for baseline characteristics such as age, log (hsCRP), total cholesterol, creatinine, recent smoking status, alcohol intake, regular exercise and diabetes mellitus. For the linear trends of risk, the number of quartiles was used as a continuous variable and tested on each model. To use the Cox proportional hazards models, we checked the validity of the proportional hazards assumption. Two approaches were used to assess the validity of the proportional hazards assumption. First, the assumption was assessed by log-minus-log-survival function and found to graphically hold. Second, to confirm the validity of the proportional hazards assumption, time-dependent covariate analysis was used. The time-dependent covariate was not statistically significant, suggesting that the proportional hazards assumption is not violated (P = 0.055). P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

            <p>Human melanoma <ref type="bibr">(Mel-29, -23 and -6)</ref> and breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) were injected s.c. in the right flank of 5-to 6-week-old male and female athymic mice <ref type="bibr">(Punj et al, 2004; Jia et al, 2011; Mehta et al, 2011)</ref>. When tumours reached 3 mm in diameter, animals were randomised into control (20 mice) and treatment (10 mice) groups, and injected i.p. with DTIC (5-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno) imidazole-4-carboxamide), 4 mg kg À 1 , 3 Â /week (melanoma); paclitaxel, 12.8 mg kg À 1 i.p., days 10, 14, 21 and 25 (breast cancer); or p28 10 or 20 mg kg À 1 i.p. 3 Â /week for 30 days. Although p28 is rapidly cleared (t ½ 0.06 h; clearance (ml kg À 1 h À 1 ) 2159), it is also rapidly taken up (Vdss (ml kg À 1 ) 297) at pharmacologically active doses <ref type="bibr">(Punj et al, 2004; Jia et al, 2011; Mehta et al, 2011)</ref>. p28 is also stable in murine serum (t 1/2 B60 min) <ref type="bibr">(Punj et al, 2004; Jia et al, 2011; Mehta et al, 2011)</ref> assuring a continuous release of the mature peptide. At necropsy, tumours were dissected, freed of fat and weighed. Statistical comparisons were performed by analysis of variance ANOVA (control vs treatment) (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a8cf03bf0d-software-0">GraphPad InStat</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#a8cf03bf0d-software-0" resp="#annotator4" type="version">3.0</rs>, La Jolla, CA, USA).</p>
            <p>Docking simulation of p28-p53 complex. ClusPro identified motifs spanning the L 1 loop (aa 112-124), within aa 139-146, a region within the S 7 -S 8 loop (aa 214-236) and R282 and L289 of the p53 DBD <ref type="bibr">(Tu et al, 2008)</ref> that were involved in the binding between p28 and p53 <ref type="figure">(Figure 1A)</ref>. Molecular surface and electrostatic potential plots of the p53DBD were calculated by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a8cf03bf0d-software-1">DeepView</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#a8cf03bf0d-software-1" resp="#annotator4" type="version">4.0.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#a8cf03bf0d-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics</rs>, Geneva, Switzerland) <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>. A blue, red and white colour gradient represents positive, negative and neutral (including hydrophobic aa) potentials on the molecular surface, respectively. The DNAbinding surface of the p53DBD is highly cationic (blue). In contrast, the p28-binding area is essentially neutral (white), suggesting that electrostatic interaction may not have a role in p28 binding to p53 <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>. The amino-acid composition of the predicted p28-binding sites on p53 was FLHSGTAVTCTYPA LTPQWEGSDCTHRL or 43% hydrophobic, 36% neutral and 21% hydrophilic residues. p28 bound to 10 of 13 aa (77%) in the L 1 loop that were 50% hydrophobic, 40% neutral and 10% hydrophilic residues and 7 of 23 aa (30%), 14% hydrophobic, 43% neutral and 43% hydrophilic, in the S 7 -S 8 loops (Figure 1C). The four amino acids residing between residues 139 and 147 predicted to bind p28 are 50% hydrophobic and 50% neutral. These residues and the L 1 and S 7 -S 8 loops are not located at or near the DNA-binding surface of p53 (R248 and R273 are direct DNA-binding residues on p53), suggesting p28 does not interfere with the ability of p53 to bind to DNA <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>. The ClusPro best score model also predicted that amino-acid residues LSTAAMQVVGDYLKDD of p28 bind to p53. Fifty per cent of the predicted residues are hydrophobic, again suggesting that hydrophobic rather than electrostatic interaction is essential to the formation of the p28-p53 complex <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>. These results agree with computational docking <ref type="bibr">(De Grandis et al, 2007)</ref> studies demonstrating that azurin binds to the L 1 and S 7 -S 8 loops of p53 through interaction of non-polar residues at the interface, creating a short-range hydrophobic interaction. A sequence map of the amino acids predicted to be involved in p28 binding and their relationship to the known binding sites of the E3 ubiquitin ligases that negatively regulate p53 is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>D. p28 does not bind to motifs shown to bind either HDM2 or Pirh2.</p>

            <p>Electrophysiological Recordings-The whole-cell and outside-out patch configurations of the patch clamp technique were used to record macroscopic and single channel currents evoked by 5-HT, respectively. Patch electrodes for both modes were filled with a solution comprising 140 mM CsCl, 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 1.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted with 1 M CsOH; final [Cs ϩ ] o ϭ 143 mM). The intracellular free calcium concentration of this solution was estimated to be 10 nM <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>. The recording chamber comprised a 35-mm Petri dish on which the cells were cultivated. Using a gravity-feed system, the chamber was superfused routinely at ϳ5 ml/min, at room temperature (20 -23°C), with extracellular solutions of the compositions described below. Single channel currents evoked by pressure-applied 5-HT (10 M) were recorded in an extracellular solution (E1) consisting of 142.8 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted by 1 M NaOH; final [Na ϩ ] o ϭ 146 mM). Whole-cell recording was used to determine the reversal potentials (E 5-HT ) of macroscopic currents elicited by 5-HT (10 M) by means of a voltageramp protocol using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="becfe77e27-software-0">WinWCP</rs> V<rs corresp="#becfe77e27-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">3 9.6</rs> electrophysiology software (<rs corresp="#becfe77e27-software-0" resp="#curator" subtype="person" type="publisher">J. Dempster</rs>, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Strathclyde, UK; available on the World Wide Web). Unless stated otherwise, E 5-HT was determined via a protocol wherein the membrane potential was initially set at Ϫ60 mV, and a macroscopic current response to 5-HT was elicited. During the plateau of the current response, the membrane potential was stepped from Ϫ60 to Ϫ100 mV for 100 ms and subsequently ramped to ϩ80 mV within 1 s. Care was taken to ensure that the current amplitude at the beginning and termination of the voltage ramp protocol were similar. An identical voltage ramp in the absence of 5-HT served to determine the leakage current and was subtracted from the currents evoked in the presence of 5-HT to generate the current-voltage (I-V) relationship specifically attributable to the 5-HT-evoked conductance. E 5-HT was determined from such leak-subtracted currents. In order to determine the permeability of Na ϩ relative to Cs ϩ (P Na /P Cs ), E 5-HT was determined in solution E1, and the permeability ratio was calculated from the Goldman-HodgkinKatz (GHK) (voltage) equation,For simplicity, we routinely refer to ion concentrations rather than activities throughout, although the latter were employed in the calculations of relative permeabilities.</p>

The ␥ value is routinely reported as the chord conductance (i.e. ␥ ϭ i/(V m Ϫ E 5-HT ), where i is single channel current amplitude, V m is the holding potential (including liquid junction potential correction), and E 5-HT is the reversal potential of the agonist-evoked macroscopic response determined as described above under the appropriate ionic conditions. In the case of the 5-HT3A(QDA) D127K mutant, single channel currents could not be resolved directly in recording from outsideout membrane patches. Thus, we estimated ␥ by fluctuation analysis of whole-cell current evoked by 5-HT (1 M) as previously described by us <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>. A rectification index (RI) is used to describe the degree of single channel current rectification. The RI was calculated as follows,</p>

A systematic approach was used to catalogue corresponding EST accession number, clone ID, top hit Arabidopsis ID and its description, corresponding gene ontologies to top hits, and associated EST IDs.

            <p>To obtain an overall view of gene regulation during E. amylovora inoculation, microarray analyses were performed. Data obtained from scans of nine oligo arrays (70-mer) containing 40, 369 apple probe sets representing 40,000 transcripts for each of the three time-point comparisons was quantified, uploaded into <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="ff781ccdb5-software-2">GeneSpring</rs> <rs corresp="#ff781ccdb5-software-2" resp="#annotator20" type="version">7.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#ff781ccdb5-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Silicon Genetics</rs>, CA), transformed, filtered, and normalized <ref type="bibr">(Gonzalez and Vodkin, 2007)</ref>. Normalized data were further filtered for expression levels for quality control to eliminate genes in thearray with no values throughout the study. A t test analysis of these genes, with a cut-off P value of &lt;0.05, identified a collection of 3500 genes that were statistically significant for at least one of the three time points <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1</ref>). Among these, 1561 genes were up-regulated (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S</ref>1 at JXB online); while 1939 genes were down-regulated (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S2</ref> at JXB online). These collective groups of genes were then used for cluster analysis by k-means clustering and functional classification of individual members.

The same database (human IPI version 3.20 consisting of 61,225 IPI numbers) was used to search all data. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-9">PeptideProphet</rs> (version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-9" resp="#annotator18" type="version">3.0</rs>) and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-10">ProteinProphet</rs> (version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-10" resp="#curator" type="version">3.0</rs>) were used to assign identified peptide and protein confidence scores for all but Lab 1 (details described below) where the complexity of samples interrogated was not sufficient to estimate the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-8">PeptideProphet</rs> error model. Quantitation was performed following tryptic search and protein inference. Finally multiple experiments within a lab were then aligned to create analytic data sets sufficient to determine relative disease status.</p>
            <p>The following common criteria were applied to all searches. A Ϯ2.0-Da error from the calculated peptide monoisotopic mass was allowed to determine whether a particular peptide sequence is to be considered as a possible model for a spectrum. Mass tolerance for fragment ions was 1 Da <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>. The maximal number of missed cleavages permitted was 2. A static modification on cysteines of ϩ57.021 Da was used for all labs except Lab 4, which performed acrylamide labeling on cysteines. A potential modification on methionines of ϩ15.9949 Da was used. A weighted average mass was used to calculate the masses of the fragment ions in a tandem mass spectrum. A minimum number of one ion was required for a peptide to be scored. A default minimum <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-9">PeptideProphet</rs> probability of 0.2 was used to calculate the protein group probability. Only peptides with probability Ն0.75 and mass error Ͻ20 ppm were selected for quantitation. Specific search parameters for the different labeling schemes by different labs are specified in the supplemental text, Part B. The following are descriptions of the software used for each lab's data and quantitation methods (summarized in supplemental <ref type="table">Table S</ref>2) during data processing.</p>
            <p>Lab 1-Lab 1 used a DIGE method and quantitated a large number of fluorescent spots with two commercial software algorithms (<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-12">DeCyder</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-12" resp="#annotator18" type="version">6.5</rs> (<rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-12" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GE Healthcare</rs>) and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-13">SameSpots</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-13" resp="#annotator18" type="version">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-13" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Nonlinear Dynamics</rs>)). A t test was performed on the log ratios using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-14">Statistica</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-14" resp="#curator" type="publisher">StatSoft, Inc</rs>.) version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-14" resp="#annotator18" type="version">7</rs> to estimate the significant difference of a protein. Only those spots found to have significant changes, based on fluorescence, between the HD and the control were selected for tandem MS analysis. Peak lists of MS/MS spectra acquired on the HCT-Ultra ion trap instrument (Bruker Daltonics) were generated using the software tool <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-15">DataAnalysis</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-15" resp="#annotator18" type="version">3.4.179</rs> (<rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-15" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bruker Daltonics</rs>) with default parameters. The built-in algorithm version 2.0 was used, and neither smoothing nor any signal-to-noise filter was applied for compound detection. A maximum charge state of 3 was considered for deconvolution. Data were then converted to mzXML files using<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-16">CompassXport</rs> (version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-16" resp="#annotator18" type="version">1.2.3</rs>). Peptides were identified using decoy database methods with an approach described by <ref type="bibr">Elias and Gygi (34)</ref>. After proteins were identified for selected spots using false discovery rate (FDR) and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-24">ProteinProphet</rs> (see details in the supplemental text, Part B), quantitation of -fold changes among different disease statuses was processed based on the following rules. 1) If a spot was quantitated by both <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-18">DeCyder</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-18" resp="#annotator18" type="version">6.5</rs> and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-27">SameSpots</rs> methods, -fold changes by <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-180">DeCyder</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-180" resp="#curator" type="version">6.5</rs> were selected because the differential expression resulting from this method is more significant on average. On the other hand, if only one quantitation method was used, results from that method were selected. 2) When multiple spots have the same protein identification, -fold changes were averaged for that protein. 3) When a spot resulted in several protein identifications, the same -fold changes were assigned to all proteins.</p>
            <p>Lab 2-Lab 2 performed label-free analysis. Peak lists were generated using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-21">MassLynx</rs> (<rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-21" resp="#annotator18" type="version">4.0</rs>) based on signals obtained by Q-ToF Micro spectrometer from Waters Micromass. The MS duty cycle was set at 1,1,4 as described in detail in the supplemental text, Part A. These data were converted to mzXML files using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-22">MassWolf</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-22" resp="#annotator18" type="version">1.02</rs> with the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-34">Waters Datafile Access Component (DAC)</rs> library. Following the database search using the common criteria, quantitation was performed using a spectral count approach <ref type="bibr">(35)</ref>, which sums the number of total spectra assigned to the protein group in that sample. Only peptide spectra with <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-35">PeptideProphet</rs> probability greater than 0.75 or an error rate of 5% were counted for each IPI entry identified. Because individual level variation can be determined for this design, we used a straightforward procedure that tracks all proteins that are members of a single <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-36">ProteinProphet</rs> group within the experiment to associate groups across multiple experiments and to flag groups that are not directly comparable (supplemental text, Part B). After summing up to master protein groups across samples, the average spectral count of all IPI entries within a "master group" was assigned to that group. For each master group, total spectral counts from 10 HD-mid samples, 10 HD-early samples, and 10 control samples were summed up and used to calculate HD-mid/control, HD-early/control, and HD-mid/HD-early ratios. Intensity-dependent ratio plots (MAplots) and histograms of light/heavy ratios were examined to ensure the quality of data for the labeled experiments. M is the y-axis and A is the x-axis, where in this paper, M ϭ Log 2 (Heavy) Ϫ Log 2 (Light); A ϭ [ 1 ⁄2] (Log 2 (Heavy) ϩ Log 2 (Light)). Lab 3-Data from Lab 3 were acquired from the LTQ-FT instrument (Thermo Finnigan). Peak lists were generated by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-24">Xcalibur</rs> (version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-24" resp="#annotator18" type="version">1.1</rs>) and converted to mzXML files using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-25">ReAdW</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-25" resp="#annotator18" type="version">1.1</rs> with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-41">XRawfile</rs> library. Default parameters were used. Database search was carried out using the common parameters and the designated specific modifications (supplemental text, Part B). Protein groups with probability score Ͼ0.9 (corresponding to an overall error rate of 0.01) were considered confident proteins for downstream analysis. The Q3 algorithm <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>, developed to accommodate a 3-dalton mass shift in heavy and light peptides, was used to compute the ratios between the light and heavy isotopic pairs using peak areas. More specifically, only confidently identified peptides (<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-42">PeptideProphet</rs> probability Ͼ0.75 and mass error Ͻ20 ppm) were selected for further quantitation at the protein level. In three pairwise comparisons, the internal standard (IS) containing equal amounts of 30 samples was labeled with light acetyl group, and each of the three disease statuses (A, B, or C) was labeled with heavy acetyl group (for details, see supplemental text, Part A). Preliminary analysis found that light/heavy ratios were skewed for both IS versus HD-early and IS versus HD-mid experiments. Because the same amount of protein was loaded into the MS instrument and, in theory, most proteins in the disease and control should remain unchanged, we normalized these ratios. Normalization at the peptide level was performed by median centering the log ratios. Experiments were then aligned to infer the protein changes of different disease status comparisons. Protein inference was performed using the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-43">ProteinProphet</rs> analysis tool at the lab level, and light/heavy ratios of these protein groups were inferred from ratios at the experiment level by comparing IPI numbers. HD-mid versus control, HD-early versus control, and HD-mid versus HD-early ratios for each protein group were calculated using IS/control, IS/HDmid, and IS/HD-early ratios from the three experiments.</p>
            <p>Lab 4 -LTQ OrbiTrap XL mass spectrometer from Thermo Finnigan was used, and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-28">Xcalibur</rs> (version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-28" resp="#annotator18" type="version">2.2</rs>) was applied to generate peak lists. Data were converted to mzXML files using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-29">ReAdW</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-29" resp="#annotator18" type="version">1.1</rs> with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-48">XRawfile</rs> library. Default parameters were used. Data were then searched with the common criteria plus specific modifications. Protein groups with probability score Ͼ0.9 (corresponding to an overall error rate of 0.01) were considered confident proteins for downstream analysis. For the labeled analysis, as with Lab 3, the Q3 algorithm <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref> was used to compute ratios between light and heavy isotopic pairs. And similarly to the methods used for Lab 3, peptides with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-49">PeptideProphet</rs> scores greater than 0.75 and a mass error of less than 20 ppm were selected for the protein level quantitation. Histograms of light/heavy ratios based on the number of cysteines in the peptides revealed that peptides with one cysteine have better normal distributions than peptides with more than one cysteine. Because 80% of peptides contain only one cysteine, only peptides with one cysteine were selected for protein level analysis. To ensure a high confidence of quantitation at the protein level, only those proteins with at least three quantitated peptides were used for further analysis. For the label-free analysis, accurate mass and time (AMT) methods were used to identify peptides in LC-MS data using a single AMT database containing all high quality (<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-50">PeptideProphet</rs> probability Ն0.95) peptide identifications from all labeled (fractionated) and unlabeled (unfractionated) data from Lab 4. The LC-MS peptide features from each unlabeled sample were matched against the combined AMT database to provide peptide assignments. Each match was assigned a probability value based on mass error and normalized retention time error between the MS1 feature and the AMT peptide entry, and only matches with probability Ն0.95 or a false assignment rate Յ0.05 were kept. LC-MS peptide intensity values for the peptides were normalized across runs, and peptide ratios were calculated. The AMT database and matching were performed using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-51">msInspect/AMT</rs> software platform <ref type="bibr">(36, 37)</ref>. Protein inference was performed using<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-52">ProteinProphet</rs>, and protein ratios were calculated as well. As with the Lab 3 analysis, experiments were aligned using the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-53">ProteinProphet</rs> analysis tool at the lab level to infer the protein changes of different disease status comparisons for the labeled and unlabeled methods. Ratios of these protein groups were inferred from ratios at the experiment level by IPI numbers.</p>
            <p>Proteins, identified by their IPI sequence, were assigned to gene symbols by IPI protein cross-reference. Because the peptide level evidence cannot uniquely identify all IPI sequences, proteins were assembled by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-54">ProteinProphet</rs> into groups <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>. Some of these protein groups contain unique protein sequences and gene symbols, and some contain multiple sequences that may result from the same gene symbol or from multiple genes within the same family (e.g. a protein group is assigned with HBG2, HBE1, HBG1, HBB, and HBD, all of which belong to the hemoglobin gene family) or multiple incompatible genes.</p>
            <p>Signal Processing of Tissue Transcriptional Expression Data-Because a significant fraction of plasma proteins is derived from various tissues and so are CSF proteins, which are filtered from plasma, to annotate proteins for their source tissues, it is critical that the transcriptional data set includes tissues of human major organs. The normal human tissue expression data set was acquired from published data provided by Ge et al. <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> that includes a total of 36 types of normal human tissue, covering the complexity of human tissues. Because all CSF samples are from adult human, the annotation will focus on the adult tissue expression pattern. Therefore, data from three fetal tissues were removed. Ge et al. <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> examined a "whole brain" and six subregions of the brain (amygdala, corpus callosum, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, hippocampus, and thalamus). However, the cortex region that is noted to have severe cell loss in Huntington disease patients was not included. We removed the "whole-brain" data because it is not obvious to us how this RNA sample was prepared. We added the cortex signals and substituted cerebellum and caudate nucleus data with data derived from an extensive study that was carried out on four parts of human normal brain (caudate nucleus, cerebellum, and BA4 and BA9 cortex) using the same microarray chips <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>. After these brain data were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets, signals detected using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-35">Affymetrix microarray suite</rs> version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-35" resp="#annotator18" type="version">5</rs> software (MAS5) for each probe were averaged over 21 caudate nucleus, 21 cerebellum, and 24 cortex (12 BA4 and 12 BA9) arrays. We plotted log 2 MAS5 signal of the caudate nucleus and cerebellum from Ge et al. <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> versus those from Hodges et al. <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> and found that the correlations are both 0.90 (supplemental <ref type="figure">Fig. S1)</ref>. These high correlations suggest that data from the two studies may be combined. So far, we have data for seven subregions of the brain. Because we want to annotate a gene as being active in the brain if it is active in any part of the brain, we summarized the brain expression data by taking the maximum across all seven subregions. As a result, transcriptional data of "brain tissues" and 26 other types of human tissues were included in our analysis. These tissues are from brain, heart, thymus, spleen, ovary, kidney, muscle, pancreas, prostate, intestine, colon, placenta, bladder, breast, uterus, thyroid, skin, salivary, trachea, adrenal, bone marrow, pituitary, spinal cord, testis, liver, stomach, and lung (supplemental <ref type="table">Table S5)</ref>. Finally many genes have multiple probes; one can choose to use the average signal or the maximum signal for each gene. In our analysis, the one with maximum signal among all tissues was selected because we considered that the maximum signal is the highest above the noise level. As a result, we observed 1941 tissue markers based on human array data (supplemental <ref type="table">Table S6</ref>). The definition of tissue-specific genes/proteins may vary with tissues included in the study and when the thresholds change.</p>
            <p>Analysis of Proteomics Data-Search engine performance and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-57">PeptideProphet</rs> details <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref> were inspected (supplemental <ref type="figure">Fig. S2A)</ref> to assure that sensitivity and error distributions were sufficient to determine correct and incorrect identifications from Labs 2, 3, and 4. The quality of data quantitation was determined by examining MA plots, histograms of light labeled/heavy labeled ratios at the peptide level, and histograms of the HD-early/control, HD-mid/control, and HD-mid/ HD-early ratios at the protein level (supplemental <ref type="figure">Fig. S2, B-D)</ref>. We observed that the distributions of logarithms of ratios are around 0 before normalization for all experiments except two interrogations from Lab 3. The log ratios for these two data sets were normalized to have a median of 0.</p>
            <p>Lab 1 used a DIGE method (see "Experimental Procedures") and quantitated a large number of fluorescent spots. Only those spots found to have significantly different changes based on fluorescence between the HD and control CSF were selected for tandem MS analysis. As a result, a total of 19 unique proteins for 42 spots were identified based on the MS/MS data <ref type="table">(Table II)</ref>, each of which is a putative biomarker candidate. As a verification of these protein identifications ("Experimental Procedures"), we compared them with the results provided by Lab 1 using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-58">Mascot</rs> search engine (supplemental Table S9) and found that there is a high consistency between the two results. In addition, proteins from more spots have been identified in this study. Lab 2 is the only lab that performed individual (non-pooled) interrogation. 335 confident protein groups (with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-59">ProteinProphet</rs> probability Ͼ0.9) were found and of these, 319 were quantitated using spectral counting (35) of highly confident peptide spectra ("Experimental Procedures"). Lab 3 pooled samples by disease status and analyzed by d 0 /d 3 acetylation of the N terminus of the peptides. 263 confident protein groups were found after aligning the three experiments using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-60">ProteinProphet</rs>. After protein ratios were inferred from individual experiments, 161 were confidently quantitated. Lab 4 pooled samples by disease status and gender. In three pairwise comparisons, proteins in pooled CSF of two disease statuses were differentially labeled with light and heavy acrylamide on cysteine residues. Because a more extensive prefractionation strategy was used, these data resulted in identification of the majority of proteins (1179 groups) reported in this study of which 377 were confidently quantitated by the Q3 algorithm (27) ("Experimental Procedures"). In addition, Lab 4's label-free analysis using AMT methods <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref> identified and quantitated 277 protein groups <ref type="table">(Table II)</ref>, ϳ100 of which are not quantitated by the labeled approach <ref type="table">(Table III)</ref>.</p>

            <p>VC was performed using a CO 2 SMOS Plus 8100 Dixtal/ Novametrix ® (Respironics, Murrisville, PA, USA). The subjects remained breathing tidal volume for 4 minutes. During this time, the variables were measured and data was stored in a computer with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="c1c6cfec19-software-simple-0">Analysis Plus</rs> ® software. At the end of data collection, an offline sequence of the respiratory cycles of the subjects was selected to accommodate a variation of ,15% for expiratory tidal volume and of ,5% for ETCO 2 tension. Respiratory cycles that had Slp2 and Slp3 equal to zero were excluded. The main variables analyzed were ETCO 2 , Slp2, Slp3, inspiratory time (T i ), expiratory time (T e ), and expiratory volume (V e ). Both slopes are given by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="c1c6cfec19-software-simple-1">Analysis Plus</rs> ® software.

            <p>GC × GC-TOFMS analyses were carried out on an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a split/splitless injector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), cryogenic dual-stage modulator and timeof-flight mass spectrometer (Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI, USA). In addition, multipurpose sampler with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="f114b69f28-software-0">Maestro</rs> software (<rs corresp="#f114b69f28-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Gerstel</rs>, Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany) was used for derivatization and sample introduction. A 10 m × 0.18 mm I.D. Rxi-5 ms (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA) column with film thickness 0.18 μm was used as the first column and a 1.5 m × 0.1 mm I.D. BPX-50 (SGE Analytical Science, Austin, TX, USA) column with film thickness of 0.1 μm as the second column. A phenyl methyl deactivated retention gap column (1.5 m × 0.53 mm I.D.) was installed in front of the first column. The injector was used in the splitless mode at 240°C for injecting 1 μl of a sample. The splitless period was 90 s. High-purity helium (Aga, Espoo, Finland) was used as the carrier gas in a constant-pressure mode with initial pressure of 276 kPa. The first column oven temperature program was as follows: 50°C (isothermal for 2 min) then 7°C/min to 240°C, and, finally, 25°/min to 300°C (3 min). The second dimension column oven temperature was maintained 20°C higher and the programming rate and hold times were similar than in the first dimension. The temperature of the transfer line was maintained at 260°C and ion source at 200°C. Modulation time was 4 s. Electron impact ionization was applied at 70 eV, and the mass range from 45 to 700 amu with 100 spectra/s was measured.</p>
            <p>Automatic peak detection and mass spectrum deconvolution were performed using a peak width set to 0.2 s. Peaks with signal-to-noise (S/N) values lower than 100 were rejected. The S/N values were based on the masses chosen by the software for quantification. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="f114b69f28-software-1">ChromaTOF</rs> version <rs corresp="#f114b69f28-software-1" resp="#annotator8" type="version">4.32</rs> (<rs corresp="#f114b69f28-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">LECO Corporation</rs>, St. Joseph, MI) was used for the raw data processing. The peak areas from total ion chromatography (TIC) were used for most of the compounds; for compounds that were quantified with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f114b69f28-software-simple-5">ChromaTOF</rs> software, peak areas of selected characteristic m/z were used.</p>
            <p>Next, the data files obtained by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="f114b69f28-software-simple-6">ChromaTOF</rs> software were exported to text files and in-house developed software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="f114b69f28-software-3">Guineu</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Castillo et al., 2011)</ref> was used for aligning and normalization of compounds for further analyses. The original GC × GC-TOFMS data includes retention times, retention indices (RI), spectral information (for possible identification), spectral similarity value (S = 0-999), and peak response data. The linear retention indices were calculated based on the total (i.e., sum of the first and the second dimension) retention times of the compounds and the retention times of the retention index standards (n-alkanes). The second dimension retention time is so short (1-3.5 s) that its contribution to the retention index is not significant. The alignment of the data was performed based on retention indices, second dimension retention times and spectra. After alignment of the GC × GC-TOFMS data, two filtration criteria was utilized for positive identification: spectral similarity N850 and maximum allowed difference in retention index between experimental and literature values b25. Only the metabolites detected in over 70% of the samples in each of the four study groups were included in the dataset. This procedure resulted in a total of 465 metabolites. The literature values were obtained from NIST 2008 Mass Spectral Library or they were determined experimentally with GC × GC-TOFMS instrument in our laboratory with authentic standards (in-house developed library). In addition, Golm metabolome database <ref type="bibr">(Kopka et al., 2005)</ref> was used for further identification of the metabolites. In cases where the metabolite identity could not be determined with available methods, the chemical class was reported based on the MS spectra <ref type="bibr">(Castillo et al., 2011)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The main analyses included all participants with valid data. Sensitivity analyses also were conducted to account for the possible effects of infections and other factors on baseline levels of CRP, because these could distort the association of CRP with outcomes. This was performed by restricting the analyses to those participants with baseline levels of CRP #10 mg/L. All data analysis used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c923d2b56c-software-0">SAS/STAT</rs> version <rs corresp="#c923d2b56c-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">9.1</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#c923d2b56c-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC).). The median CRP was 1.8 mg/L (interquartile range 0.8-4.1) overall; 1.7 mg/L (0.8-3.6) in men and 2 mg/L (0 <ref type="bibr">8- 4.5)</ref> in women (Wilcoxon test, P , 0.0001); and 3.2 mg/L (1.5-6.2) and 1.8 mg/L (0.8-4.0), respectively, in participants with and without diabetes (P , 0.0001). The relationships between quintiles of CRP and study covariates are depicted in <ref type="table">Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1</ref> based on three subgroups of CRP (i.e., ,1, 1-3, and .3 mg/L). The least favorable levels of conventional risk factors were apparent in the higher CRP groups. Most of these relationships were stepwise across the CRP quintiles.CRP and outcomes overall and by diabetes status CRP was positively and continuously associated with CVD and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with an SD higher log e CRP conferring a 53% (95% CI 43-64) higher risk of cardiovascular death and a 43% (38-49) higher risk of death from any cause. In people with and without diabetes, an SD higher log e CRP was associated with 54% (28-85) and 52% (41-63), respectively, greater risk of cardiovascular death and 53% (35-72) and 41% (35-47), respectively, greater risk of all-cause mortality. There was little evidence of heterogeneity by diabetes status for those associations (both P $ 0.08 for interaction). Across quintiles of CRP distribution, there also was a graded association between CRP and mortality overall and in participants with and without diabetes. These associations were log linear for both allcause and cardiovascular mortality (all P , 0.0001 for log linearity) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1</ref>). Across subgroups of participants based on three categories of CRP (i.e., ,1, 1-3, and .3 mg/L), there also was a graded association between CRP and outcomes, except in people with diabetes, for whom a higher risk of all-cause mortality was observed only in those within the upper stratum (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).</p>

            <p>In total, more than 20 000 human pseudogenes and their cognate genes were obtained from the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-0">Ensembl Genome Browser</rs> (Ensembl <rs corresp="#a8d53fbc0a-software-0" resp="#annotator26" type="version">63</rs>, <ref type="bibr">GRCH</ref></p>
            <p>According to the study by <ref type="bibr">Poliseno et al. (17)</ref>, pseudogenes PTENP1 and KRAS1P act as a 'miRNA decoy', binding to and thereby reducing the effective cellular concentration ofmiRNAs, therefore resulting their cognate genes to escape miRNA-mediated repression. In this study, we analyse the relationships between TPG and its cognate gene with miRNA decoys mechanism to examine miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) by performing a pipeline. First, the parental genes were obtained by mapping the TPGs and genomic sequences with the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-2">BLAST</rs> (51) program. The MTIs with TPGs and parental genes were then investigated using our previous approach <ref type="bibr">(41)</ref>. The MFE threshold was À20 kcal/mol with a score more than or equal to 150 for <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-3">miRanda</rs> and default parameters for <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-4">TargetScan</rs> and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-5">RNAhybrid</rs>. Finally, the TPGs and their cognates co-regulated by miRNAs were obtained. The miRNA and 3'UTR sequences were obtained from miRBase R18 <ref type="bibr">(29, 30)</ref> and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-1">Ensembl Genome Browser</rs> release <rs corresp="#a8d53fbc0a-software-1" resp="#curator" type="version">63</rs> (26), respectively. Analysis results indicated that 874 miRNAs with MFE À20 and Score ! 150 interact with many possible target sites in 248 TPGs and their cognate genes and might potentially co-regulate this pair of TPG and parental gene (Supplementary File 2).</p>
            <p>In <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-8">pseudoMap</rs>, various databases are integrated and maintained with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-5">MySQL</rs> (<rs corresp="#a8d53fbc0a-software-5" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.mysql.com</rs>/) relational database management system. While operating on an <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-6">Apache HTTP server</rs> (<rs corresp="#a8d53fbc0a-software-6" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.apache.org</rs>/) and PHP (http://www.php.net/) on a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-7">Linux</rs> operation system (<rs corresp="#a8d53fbc0a-software-7" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// www.linux.com</rs>), <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-15">pseudoMap</rs> was constructed using the Smarty template engine (http://www.smarty.net). Based on PHP, JavaScript (http://www.javascriptsource.com/), CSS (http://www.w3schools.com/css/) and HTML (http://www. w3schools.com/html/) languages, the web interface enables dynamic <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-16">MySQL</rs> queries with user-friendly graphics. Above software are open source technologies.</p>
            <p>Comparison with other previous databases related to pseudogenes A few databases have been constructed to explore pseudogenes. In particular, PseudoGene database (53) identifies pseudogenes using various computational methods in genomes; HOPPSIGEN (54) represents the homologous processed pseudogenes shared between the mouse and human genomes that contains location information and potential function; as a web-based system, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-17">PseudoGeneQuest</rs> <ref type="bibr">(55)</ref> identifies novel human pseudogenes based on a userprovided protein sequence; in addition, the University of Iowa's UI Pseudogenes website contains human pseudogenes and the candidates for gene conversion <ref type="bibr">(56)</ref>. However, these databases focus on automatic detection of pseudogenes by using a variety of homology-based approaches. Our database, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-18">pseudoMap</rs>, aims at providing comprehensive resource for genome-wide identifying the functions and regulators of human TPGs. In briefly, there are three major differentiating features from currently public databases of pseudogenes. First, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-19">pseudoMap</rs> elucidates the relationships of TPG and its cognate gene with miRNA decoys mechanism. Second, to explore the interaction of TPG and its parental gene, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-20">pseudoMap</rs> provides the gene expression profiles of TPG and its cognate gene in various experimental conditions. Third, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-21">pseudoMap</rs> curates the TPG-derived esiRNAs, which supported by deep sequencing data, as well as their interacting gene targets in the human genome. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> lists the detailed comparisons of <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a8d53fbc0a-software-simple-22">pseudoMap</rs> with other previous databases related to pseudogenes.</p>

            <p>Mouse hearts were quickly dissected and washed in cold PBS. After removal of the atria, ventricles were lysed in a Precellys ceramic lysing kit tube with 1 ml RIPA buffer by two 30-s cycles at 5,000 rpm in PRECELLYS 24 (Bertin Technologies). Ventricle or adult cardiomyocyte lysates (see the Adult mouse cardiomyocyte isolation section) were then incubated with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose beads in RIPA buffer for 4 h at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min before loading in 4-12% NuPAGE (Life Technologies) precast gels for Western analysis. For the analysis of CamKII, PLB, and Troponin I, hearts were perfused in a Langendorff apparatus as described in the Langendorff heart preparation section with a modified Krebs solution with or without 20 ng/ml BDNF (PeproTech) or 5 µM Forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) used as a positive control. Heart contractility was monitored during the perfusion process and at the peak of cardiac pressure induced by BDNF or Forskolin the hearts were snap frozen with stainless steel clamps cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored frozen before homogenization in RIPA buffer supplemented with proteases (complete mini; Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP; Roche). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatants were diluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and loaded in a gel for Western analysis. Membranes (PVDF; Life Technologies) were blocked in 5% nonfat milk or 5% BSA in TBS-Tween before incubation with a specific antibody. Antibodies were as follows: anti-TrkB (against the extracellular domain of TrkB and therefore recognizing all TrkB isoforms; EMD Millipore), anti-TrkB.T1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-GAPDH (EMD Millipore), anti-CaV 1.2a1c (L-Type calcium channel subunit a1c,; Alomone Lab), anti-HA (for Western, Covance; for immunoprecipitation, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Phospho-TrkB raised against phosphorylated TrkB-Tyr516 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-total CAMKII (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-CAMKII P-T286/T287 (Cell Signaling Technology), antitotal Phospholamban (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-Phospholamban P-S16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Phospholamban P-T17 (Badrilla), and anti-total and P-Ser 23/24 Troponin I (Cell Signaling Technology). After incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, membranes were incubated with ECL substrate for detection of HRP enzyme activity (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualized in a Syngene gel documentation system.

Cardiomyocytes were field stimulated (0.5/s) with platinum electrodes (FHC Inc.) and recordings were made at 27°C in 1 mM Ca 2+ solution. BDNF was applied at 50 ng/ml using a picospritzer at 30 hPa and a glass pipette with 1-M Ohm tip resistance. Excited at 340 nM, indo1-AM emission was split into two channels and passed through 405/10-nm (calcium-bound emission) and 488/10-nm (calcium-free emission) fluorescence filters. Light collected by photodiodes (Till Photonics) was digitally converted at 10 KHz (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="b0ac6e5094-software-3">pClamp</rs> <rs corresp="#b0ac6e5094-software-3" resp="#curator" type="version">10</rs> and Digidata 1322a) and computed and the information was stored.</p>
            <p>Ca 2+ -tolerant cardiomyocytes cells were placed in a recording chamber and perfused with a Na + -free solution containing 137 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM Hepes, and 10 mM glucose (pH 7.4 with TEA-OH) at a flux of 1 ml/min at 27°C. The pipette solution contained 111 mM CsCl, 20 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mM glucose, 14 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, and 5 mM MgATP (pH 7.3 with CsOH). Pulled borosilicate glass pipettes at ∼3-4 MOhm filled with pipette solution were used to obtain gigaseal on cardiomyocytes and subsequent whole-cell voltage clamp. Currents (I Ca−L ) were elicited by applying depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of −60 mV (-50 mV to +70 mV, 10-mV increments) and recorded (filtered at 2 kHz through a 4-pole low-pass Bessel filter and digitized at 5 kHz) with a Multiclamp 700B (Axon) using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="b0ac6e5094-software-5">pClamp</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b0ac6e5094-software-5" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Axon</rs>).

            <p>Carcass transport. We simulated the movement of carcasses from farms to processing plants directly or indirectly, through intermediate plants, following the scheme shown in the <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. We estimated the distance travelled by carcasses using the main national paved road network and the network analysis extension in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="ce19bdbef3-software-0">ArcGIS</rs> <rs corresp="#ce19bdbef3-software-0" resp="#annotator8" type="version">10.1</rs>. As the location of each farm was not available, we considered the center of each 10 3 10 km grid to be the point of origin (i.e., the farm) from which carcasses were moved. From these points, we calculated the distance travelled by trucks to the nearest plant. If this plant was a processing plant, then carcass movement was considered complete. If this plant was an intermediate plant, another truck was used to completethe transport of the carcasses to processing plants. In our analysis, movements from farms (i.e., grid centers) to intermediate or processing plants were performed daily, using 7.5 t rigid trucks of 230 hp, while movements from intermediate to processing plants occurred weekly and used 24 t articulated trucks of 340 hp. Vehicle types were determined by direct information from companies and regional regulations. We assumed that daily trucks collected all the carcasses generated within a grid cell until they reached their full load (7.5 t). Trucks moving carcasses from intermediate to processing plants were also completely loaded. Typically, more than one truck per week moved from an intermediate plant to a processing plant. All trips were calculated twice, as trucks must make the same trip in both directions. Intermediate and processing plants were geographically located using information provided by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment and the Autonomous Communities <ref type="bibr">35</ref>. Distance calculations were made using the shortest road between origin and destination points (i.e., farms to intermediate or processing plants, and intermediate plants to processing plants), and prioritizing road type from highest to lowest speed (i.e., highways, national roads, autonomic roads, streets, and unpaved roads) <ref type="bibr">36</ref>. GHG emissions. During the combustion process, most carbon is immediately emitted as CO 2 , although other GHG such as N 2 O and CH 4 are also produced. Thus, we calculated the emissions of these three gases separately as E(i) 5 AD * EF(i), where i is the gas type (CO 2 , CH 4 or N 2 O), AD is activity data and EF is the emission factor, 73.7 t/TJ for CO <ref type="bibr">2 37</ref> and 0.0039 t/TJ for CH 4 and N 2 O 24 . Activity data (AD) was calculated as FC * FD * LHV, where FC is fuel consumption, FD is fuel density and LHV is lower heat value. FD (0.845 kg/l) and LHV (0.0424 TJ/t) were obtained from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment 33 . FC was calculated by multiplying the distance covered by each truck by the expected average fuel consumption per km expected by each type of truck <ref type="bibr">24</ref>. We considered that all trucks of the same type consumed the same quantity of fuel per km regardless of their load (0.21 l/km for trucks used to move carcasses from farms to the nearest plant and 0.26 l/km for trucks used to move carcasses from intermediate plants to processing plants) <ref type="bibr">38</ref>. We assumed that all trucks used oil/diesel fuel and were 11 yrs old, such that motors are thermally stabilized and do not have catalysts. These assumptions are based on the fact that in 2011, ca. 90% of trucks and vans in Spain were diesels, and their average age was 11 yrs old <ref type="bibr">39</ref>. As fuel combustion is not perfect and a small portion may lead to residuals (ash and soot), we included an ''oxidation factor'' which expresses the ratio of CO 2 emitted per fuel unit (0.99) <ref type="bibr">37</ref>. Results are presented as CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 eq.), a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of CO 2 that would have the same global warming potential (GWP) when measured over a specified timescale (100 years) <ref type="bibr">24</ref>. GWP values for CH 4 and N 2 O were 34 and 298, respectively, with climate-carbon feedback values and lifetimes taken from <ref type="bibr">40</ref>. CO 2 eq. is expressed as parts per million by volume and referred to the 10 3 10 km grid cell where carcasses originated.</p>
            <p>Scavenger distribution. We used data available from the Spanish National Biodiversity Inventory 33 to map the distribution of obligate scavengers (i.e., griffon Gyps fulvus, cinereous Aegypius monachus, Egyptian Neophron percnopterus and bearded vultures Gypaetus barbatus) across Spain. We focused on the breeding population, which represents approximately two-thirds of the total vulture population. We calculated the distance of each 10 3 10 km grid center to the nearest breeding site (i.e., nest or colony) of any obligate scavenger. Because of the high daily mobility of these species (griffon vultures: up to 70 km from breeding sites; cinereous vultures: up to 86 km from breeding sites; bearded vultures: up to 45 km from breeding sites; Egyptian vultures: up to 70 km from breeding sites) <ref type="bibr">12,41</ref>, we also calculated their richness (i.e., number of species) in a 100 km buffer around each 10 3 10 km grid cell. We used Generalized Linear Models (1/mu 2 link function and inverse Gaussian error distribution) to explore the relationship between metric tons of CO 2 eq. per grid and distance to the nearest obligate scavenger breeding site. Metric tons of CO 2 eq. in a 100 km buffer around grids with different species richness (from 0 to 4) were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. All analyses were performed in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ce19bdbef3-software-simple-2">R</rs> <ref type="bibr">42</ref>.

A second program parsed these annotated structures to extract each class of potentially edited sites. We divided 494 UAG triplet sites in dsRNA regions of 291 primiRNAs into four groups: W-C group; U and G in UAG triplet form Watson-Crick base pairing (201 sites in 157 pri-miRNAs). G-U group; Either U or G, or both in UAG triplet forms G-U wobble base pairing (122 sites in 105 primiRNAs). Mismatch group; Either U or G in UAG triplet forms mismatch base pairing (90 sites in 79 pri-miRNAs). Others group; Both U and G in UAG triplet form mismatch base pairing (81 sites in 76 pri-miRNAs). We excluded the Others group from further analysis, because it is very unlikely that RNA editing happens under this condition. Similarly, we also counted and divided all non-UAG triplet sites present in 474 pri-miRNAs into three categories: W-C group, G-U group and Mismatch group in order to estimate their editing frequency <ref type="table">(Table 9)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The results are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for the quantitative variables and are summarized by absolute frequencies and percentages for the categorical variables. Differences in the distribution of the characteristics in the patients were examined using the chi-square test for the discrete variables, while the t-test was employed to examine differences between the two groups for the continuous variables. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to eliminate the effect of the confounders. For the statistical analyses, the statistical software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator15" type="software" xml:id="ea603d6b0f-software-0">SPSS</rs> version <rs corresp="#ea603d6b0f-software-0" resp="#annotator15" type="version">16.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#ea603d6b0f-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL) and the statistical package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator15" type="software" xml:id="ea603d6b0f-software-1">SAS</rs> version <rs corresp="#ea603d6b0f-software-1" resp="#annotator15" type="version">9.1</rs> for windows (<rs corresp="#ea603d6b0f-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute Inc</rs>., Cary, NC, USA) were used.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the multivariable linear regression test, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator15" type="software" xml:id="ea603d6b0f-software-2">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#ea603d6b0f-software-2" resp="#annotator15" type="version">16</rs>, showed a higher range of PaO 2 / FiO 2 at one hour after extubation and PaO 2 / FiO 2 at four hours after extubation in the patients with the new extubation method than that in those with the conventional extubation method (8.888 mmHg and 8.248 mmHg, respectively); there were, however, no significant differences.</p>
            <p>Finally, considering the cut point of 225 for PaO 2 / FiO 2 , we found PaO 2 / FiO 2 &lt; 225 in about 51.3% and 37.3% in the conventional and new method groups, respectively, at one hour after extubation and also 54.2% and 32.7% in the control and case groups, respectively, at four hours after extubation; the differences were statistically significant. Therefore, the efficiency of the new method for enhancing PaO 2 / FiO 2 and oxygenation rate was apparent in the level &lt; 225. Regarding the other ABG variables such as pH, BE (base excess), and PaO 2 , their differences were not significant statistically; be that as it may, almost all of them enjoyed improvement in the new method group. Furthermore, with respect to rough parameters, clinical need to perform ABG analysis, and use of reservoir masks or nasal cannulae, there were fewer patients with Po 2 / Fio 2 &lt; 200 and PO 2 / FiO 2 &lt; 300 at one and four hours after extubation in the case group. Although these differences are not statistically significant, they seem to further underscore the efficiency of the new method. At forty-eight hours after extubation, in the conventional method group, 8 patients (of 20), who required ABG, had respiratory parameters within the range of PO 2 / FiO 2 &lt; 150, while none of the new method group patients needed ABGforty-eight hours after extubation. Given the high rate of mortality and morbidity in such patients, these percentages should be regarded as a very important clinical parameter to compare the two groups and to introduce the new method as an effective and safe extubation method. Considering confounding variables in the logistic regression test using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator15" type="software" xml:id="ea603d6b0f-software-3">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#ea603d6b0f-software-3" resp="#annotator15" type="version">9.1</rs> software, we found that in almost all the time periods, PaO 2 / FiO 2 was higher in the new extubation method group; however, only PaO 2 / FiO 2 four hours after extubation &lt; 225 between the two groups was statistically significant <ref type="table">(Table 6</ref>).</p>

            <p>In-gel proteolytic digestion of Coomassie-stained bands was performed essentially as described <ref type="formula">(34)</ref>, using trypsin (Roche). Samples were subjected to nanoflow liquid (LC) chromatography (Agilent 1100 series) and concentrated on a C18 precolumn (100 mm ID, 2 cm). Peptides were separated on an analytical column (75 mM ID, 20 cm) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min with a 60 min linear acetonitrile gradient from 0 to 80%. The LC system was directly coupled to a QTOF Micro tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass Waters, UK). A survey scan was performed from 400 to 1200 a.m.u./s and precursor ions were sequenced in MS/MS mode at a threshold of 150 counts. Data were processed and subjected to database searches using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="dcc2607a1f-software-1">Proteinlynx Global Server</rs> version <rs corresp="#dcc2607a1f-software-1" resp="#annotator26" type="version">2.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#dcc2607a1f-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Micromass</rs>, UK) or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="dcc2607a1f-software-2">MASCOT</rs> software (<rs corresp="#dcc2607a1f-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Matrixscience</rs>) against SWISSPROT and the NCBI non-redundant database, with a 0.25-Da mass tolerance for both precursor ion and fragment ion.

            <p>The Ccr4-Not complex is involved in mRNA biogenesis at different levels (reviewed in <ref type="bibr">21,22)</ref>. Here, we show that the NOT genes, in contrast to CCR4 and the CAF genes, are required for global and gene-specific tri-methylation of H3K4 <ref type="figure">(Figures 2, 3 and 4</ref>). In addition, we found that the Ccr4-Not complex is functionally linked to the Bur1/2 kinase complex <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>), which is also specifically required for H3K4 tri-methylation <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. The mechanism by which the Ccr4-Not complex is involved in this histone modification is independent of direct regulation of the Set1p histone methyltransferase complex <ref type="figure">Figure 5)</ref>. Instead, the Ccr4-Not complex functions parallel to orThe indicated proteins were identified using LC-MS/MS. Several additional proteins were present in the not4D purification when compared to the WT. Mass spectrometry showed that these bands contained non-related lysosomal proteins. We consider this an artifact of the purification, likely caused by differences in the concentration of the lysates of the WT and not4D cells. (C) Histone methyl transferase assay using purified Set1p complexes. Increasing amounts of Set1p complex or a mock-purification control were use to methylate soluble histones (from calf thymus) in vitro. Samples were separated on a 15% SDS-PAA gel, stained with Coomassie, dried and exposed to an X-ray film. (D) In vitro methylation of synthetic pre-methylated histone H3-tail peptides. Pre-methylated peptides were used as substrates for in vitro methylation using Set1p complexes purified from WT or not4D cells. Samples were separated on a 20% SDS-PAA gel, dried and exposed to an X-ray film. Signals were quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="dcc2607a1f-software-simple-6">ImageQuant</rs> software and represented as arbitrary units after background correction.downstream of Bur1/2p at the level of PAF complex recruitment, resulting in decreased ubiquitylation of H2B, in cells lacking NOT4 <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>). Taken together, our results provide a detailed study of the role of the Ccr4-Not complex in the regulation of global H3K4 tri-methylation. Further, they confirm a functional distinction between the cytoplasmic deadenylase activity of the Ccr4p-Caf1p module and the nuclear function of the Not-proteins of the Ccr4-Not complex <ref type="bibr">(42)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tests was used to compare variables. All continuous variables are shown as the mean -standard deviation except for ANCOVA analysis (mean -standard error). To compare the relationship among HbA1c, GA and other variables, Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to assess the associations between clinical and laboratory variables. We analyzed the differences in the correlated coefficients between PCGR or HOMA-b and glycemic indices using Steiger's Z-test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of PCGR was shown, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for separating each medication group. To determine the optimal cut-off value, the point on the ROC curve with maximum Youden index (sensitivity + specificity -1) was calculated.

            <p>Methods. Identification of prior research studies was performed using the search terms: anxiety; BC; marital relationship; spouse; MQ; Middle East; and KSA in various combinations. These search words were entered into PubMed and <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="ead0656800-software-simple-0">Google Scholar</rs> to locate all relevant studies. A convenience sample of women with BC (volunteers) was recruited between January 2013 and March 2013 from King Abdulaziz University's (KAU) Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi Breast Cancer Center of Excellence in Jeddah, KSA. Consecutive women presenting to the outpatient clinic for initial assessment or follow-up were approached for inclusion in the study. The inclusion criteria were: age 18 to 65 years; diagnosis of BC documented in the medical record; currently married; and attending the clinic on the day that the interviewers were present in the clinic. The exclusion criteria were women without BC, those outside the age range above, those who were not currently married, and all those being seen on days and times when interviewers were not present. The average length of time that participants were diagnosed with and/or experienced symptoms of BC were 38.4 months (range 2 weeks to 180 months). The questionnaire was translated into Arabic, and was self-completed by participants. Medical students (trained by KAU psychiatry faculty on how to approach patients, obtain consent, and administer the questionnaire) explained the study to the participants and obtained informed consent before proceeding. The institutional review board of KAU Hospital approved the study following the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
            <p>Statistical analyses. The characteristics of the sample were described by means + standard deviations (SD) or percentages <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref>. A correlation matrix (Pearson r) was constructed for all study variables <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). In multivariate analyses, income was dichotomized into low (&lt;3,000=0) versus high (&gt;3,000=1), and education was dichotomized into low (0=no education or only primary school) versus high (one=high school or beyond). Blocks of independent variables were entered in a stepwise fashion into 3 general linear models predicting the dependent variable (anxiety symptoms): model one included only the sample demographics (age, nationality, education, employment, income); model 2 included demographics and cancer-related factors; and model 3 included demographics, cancerrelated factors, and overall MQ <ref type="table">Table 3)</ref>. Given the sample size, only independent variables significant at p&lt;0.10 were carried forward into later models. Since these analyses were largely exploratory, the significance level was set at p=0.05, and analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

They carry signatures that may indicate variations introduced in the molecular structure due to ligand binding or alteration of crystallization conditions. Eventually, they can be referred to as crystallographic ensembles in analogy with statistical ensembles obtained from molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations as done recently <ref type="bibr">(Halder and Bhattacharyya, 2010; Samanta et al., 2010)</ref>. We have performed pair-wise secondary structure comparison for these classes to compare the structural similarity between them. For secondary structure assignment, the base pairing patterns of each RNA structure in a functional class have been obtained using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-3">BPFind</rs> software tool <ref type="bibr">(Das et al., 2006)</ref>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-4">BPFind</rs> gives us the secondary structure of a nucleic acid at the basepairing level. These secondary structural information of basepairing for each chain have been converted to a one-dimensional string of characters: H, N, T, and L corresponding to Watson-Crick base pairs, non-canonical base pairs, base triplets, and unpaired www.frontiersin.orgbases, respectively. The secondary structures thus obtained correspond to individual RNA chains separately and do not consider inter-chain base pairing information. These secondary structural sequences are then compared with that of the best representative structure of that class using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm <ref type="bibr">(Needleman and Wunsch, 1970)</ref> as implemented in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-5">EMBOSS</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Rice et al., 2000)</ref>. An identity scoring matrix (EDNAMAT) was used for such alignment with a gap-open penalty of −10.0 and gap-extension penalty of -0.5. We find that the average similarity is 80% or more for a set of similar structures of a given class having 30 or more RNA chains. The detailed analyses of structural variation among these crystallographic ensembles are beyond the scope of this paper and would be presented elsewhere. Here a point to note is that secondary structure comparison have not been performed for crystal structures with resolution worse than 3.5Å because of the poor quality of secondary structural information obtained from such structures. RNA structures solved by NMR spectroscopy or electron microscopy are also not included in secondary structure comparison for the same reason.Comparison of secondary structure can also be useful to predict the functions of unannotated RNAs. As mentioned in the earlier section, the functional types of many RNA chains that have been placed under the other-RNA and unannotated-RNA classes could not be obtained from the PDB files unambiguously.</p>
            <p>However, we find that there are a number of structures in these two types, which are of significant length (30 nucleotide or more). We have performed structural comparison of these RNA chains with known functional RNAs available in the suggested nonredundant dataset, consisting of only X-ray crystal structures with www.frontiersin.org resolution better than 3.5Å. For the secondary structure alignment, the basepairing pattern for each RNA structure in the non-redundant dataset, obtained using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-6">BPFind</rs> software, comprises a database of known structural forms of well-classified functional RNAs. In a similar way, the secondary structural data for each of the unannotated RNA chains were generated and compared against the database of known structural forms. Thus, the secondary structural information of an unannotated RNA chain has been aligned with secondary structural information of each RNA chain present in the non-redundant dataset using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment. We have assigned probable function of an unannotated RNA as identical to some known structural form with which the best similarity score is obtained. For example, chain A of 1FIR shows highest score of 362 against chain A of 1EVV <ref type="table">Table 4)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Approximately 1.5 × 10 4 Rep-Neo cells/well were seeded in a phenol red-free DMEM medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS in an opaque (for Rluc assay) or a clear (for cytotoxicity assay) 96-well plate (Corning). At incubating the cells at 37°C for 16 h, medium was replaced with fresh phenol red-free medium containing 2% FBS. The reason for using 2% FBS phenol red-free medium (rather than 10% FBS medium) is to minimize protein binding of compounds. Compounds NITD-008 (a gift from Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases) with 10-fold serial dilutions were added to cells. Cells were also treated with 0.9% DMSO as a negative control. After 48 h of treatment at 37°C, cells were assayed for Rluc activity using ViviRen substrates (Promega) or cell viability using Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Sigma) as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Xie et al., 2011)</ref>. The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) and 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ) were estimated by using a four-parameter logistic regression model from the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="ea9be0892d-software-1">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#ea9be0892d-software-1" resp="#curator" type="version">5</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ea9be0892d-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GraphPad Software Inc</rs>., San Diego CA). For the antiviral screening assay, we chose ViviRen substrate, rather than Renilla lysis buffer/substrate (as described for transient replicon assay), to improve the assay throughput. This is because ViviRen substrate is able to penetrate into cells, thus eliminating the step of cell lysis during antiviral screening. <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>a depicts the ZIKV replicon containing a Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene (pZIKV Rep WT). The pZIKV Rep WT was constructed by replacing the viral structural genes with Rluc using a full-length cDNA infectious clone (pFLZIKV) <ref type="bibr">(Shan et al., 2016b)</ref>. As a control, Rep-NS5ΔGDD was constructed by mutating the viral polymerase GDD active site to Ala (G664A-D665A-D66A in ZIKV; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a)</ref>. A T7 promoter and a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDVr) sequence were engineered at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the replicon cDNA for in vitro transcription and for generation of the authentic 3′ end of the RNA transcript, respectively. Upon transfection into Huh7 cells, wild-type (WT) replicon RNA generated two distinct Rluc peaks <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref>. The first peak appeared at 2 h post-transfection (p.t.) and decreased from 4 to 8 h. At 24 h p.t., the Rluc signal increased by 200 folds above that of 2 h post-transfection. At 32 h p.t., the Rluc signal reached the second peak. Mutation of the viral polymerase GDD motif (Rep-NS5ΔGDD) abolished the second Rluc peak, but did not affect the first Rluc peak. Collectively, the results indicate that the first and second Rluc peaks represent the translation of the input RNA and the translation of the newly synthesized RNA, respectively. These results are in agreement with the previously reported flavivirus replicons <ref type="bibr">(Lo et al., 2003a)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Given the dramatic pace of expansion in experimental and bioinformatics data pertaining to TA systems in the last 10 years and the likely impending avalanche triggered by next-generation sequencing-facilitated prokaryoticand metagenomic-sequencing projects, we have created a<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-0">PostgreSQL</rs> database of Type 2 TA systems, known as TADB (http://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/TADB/), that provides for ready access, analysis, manipulation and exploitation of this invaluable biological information. We propose that TADB should serve as a 'one-stop-shop' for all Type 2 TA data sets and resources and are confident that in time it will facilitate efficient, multi-disciplinary and innovative exploration of the bacteria and archaea TA space, further defining presently recognized phenomena and potentially even leading to yet-to-be envisaged frontiers.</p>
            <p>As of 30 July 2010, TADB contains 10 753 type 2 TA gene pairs identified within 1240 genome sequences representative of 962 strains of phylogenetically diverse bacteria and archaea. The data in TADB are derived from computationally predicted data sets and/or reports of experimentally validated TA genes. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-1">BLASTP</rs>-identified 921 TA loci present in 147 sequenced genomes reported by Gerdes and co-workers <ref type="bibr">(3,7)</ref> were first uploaded and classified into eight TA families. Next, the 5806 TA loci found in 604 genomes which had been assigned to 44 conserved TA domain pairs by <ref type="bibr">Makarova et al. (4)</ref> were archived in TADB. The database was then further complemented with the data set of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-2">RASTA-Bacteria</rs> predicted TA loci identified in 883 annotated genomes. The <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-3">RASTA- Bacteria</rs> algorithm utilizes <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-4">RPSBLAST</rs> search and typical characteristics of TA loci, such as a two-gene, co-directed module coding for small proteins, to identify TA hits <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-5">RASTA-Bacteria</rs> TA pair hits with one score &gt;70% and the other &gt;60% were recorded by TADB, this strict cut-off yields broadly reliable TA candidates <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>. Subsequently, the three data sets mentioned above were compared to ensure that only de-duplicated entries were included in TADB; identical TA loci from identical strains were eliminated.</p>
            <p>In addition, we have identified further examples of known or putative TA loci by searching PubMed using the search terms 'toxin AND antitoxin' and manually inspecting all PubMed hits. Supplementary TA loci identified by this literature search strategy included six TA pairs, absent from the first three data sets mentioned above, in M. tuberculosis H37Rv (NC_000962) that had recently been <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. At present, TADB contains details of 106 experimentally validated TA loci. Significantly, text mining has identified a further three TA families and three three-component TA families that belong to more recently identified TA families that would not be detected by the current version of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-6">RASTA-Bacteria</rs>. Our TADB database now includes members of 11 two-component and 3 three-component TA families. These TA families were classified based on toxin protein sequence similarity and tertiary structure, as described in the reviews by Gerdes et al. <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> and Van Melderen and Saavedra De Bast (2) (See http://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/TADB/ Introduction.html for more details). We have also classified TADB entries by a second classification system based on identification of TA pairs sharing cognate TA domains and independent of wider protein-level similarity as suggested recently by <ref type="bibr">Makarova et al. (4)</ref>, yet again offering the potential for future enhanced genome data mining and further expansion of the TADB database. TADB is expected to grow dramatically given next-generation sequencing-facilitated rapid acceleration in prokaryotefocused whole genome sequencing projects. As more information about the TA loci becomes available, the database will be expanded and improved accordingly.</p>
            <p>TADB is implemented as a <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-7">PostgreSQL</rs> relational database. The ontology-based Chado schema (15) was employed to house annotations and sequences of 1000 prokaryotic genomes which had been downloaded from the NCBI Refseq archive <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>. A second customized schema was designed to organize the available experimental and in silico analyses data and references relating to TA loci reported in the literatures. TADB runs on a <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-8">Linux</rs> platform with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-9">Apache</rs> web-server. Web interfaces were developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The majority of data pipelines were developed with PHP and Perl. In addition, the following freely available components were employed: (i) genome browser <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-10">Gbrowse</rs> <ref type="formula">(17)</ref>; (ii) circular genome visualization tool <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-11">CGview</rs> (18); (iii) multiple sequence alignment and visualization tools,<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-12">MUSCLE</rs> <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-13">Jalview</rs> <ref type="formula">(20)</ref>; (iv) primer design tool <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-14">Primer3Plus</rs> (21); (v) <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-15">IslandViewer</rs> (database of genomic islands) <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>; (vi) dndDB (database of DNA backbone phosphorothioation) (23); (vii) ACLAME database (A CLAssification of genetic Mobile Elements) (24); (viii) GOLD database of genome sequencing projects <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>.</p>
            <p>At the heart of TADB is the 'Browse by organism' page that provides a hyperlinked organized catalog of over 900 prokaryotic genomes with TA systems identified by one of the above-mentioned strategies. TADB allows the users to view genomic maps flagged by hyperlinked TA loci color-coded by TA family to provide a genome-scale view TA locus repertoires. In addition, users can access individual pages dedicated to each TA locus pair, toxin and antitoxin as required. As an example, TA loci in Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4 (NCBI Refseq accession no. NC_009483) were analysed <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4 is a Gram negative Delta Proteobacteria which can reduce uranium using acetate and other organic acids (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S3C)</ref>. Recently G. uraniireducens has been used experimentally in bioremediation of metal-contaminated subsurface environments <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>. Tabulated <ref type="figure">(Figure 1A)</ref> and graphically displayed <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref> outputs of the 74 putative TA pairs with conserved TA domains (4) in G. uraniireducens Rf4 are as shown. In addition, a further eight putative TA loci predicted by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-16">RASTA-Bacteria</rs> (6) are also included in these outputs. The genomic context of a selected TA locus is readily investigated further by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-17">Gbrowse</rs>, as shown for the putative TA locus Gura_2469-Gura_2470 <ref type="figure">(Figure 1D)</ref>. The putative toxin protein (yet to be experimentally characterized), Gura_2470, contains a MNT (minimal nucleotidyltransferase) domain, while its cognate putative antitoxin, Gura_2469, harbors a HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) domain (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S3D) (4)</ref>. Equivalent domain-level data are available for 12 other G. uraniireducens Rf4 putative TA pairs archived within TADB (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S3)</ref>. Interestingly, a second putative TA pair Gura_2467-Gura_2468 (4) is located a short distance upstream of the Gura_2469-Gura_2470 TA pair. This second toxin, Gura_2467, contains a RES domain (COG5654), which contains three highly conserved polar groups (arginine, glutamate and serine) that could form an active site. Its matching antitoxin, Gura_2468, contains an Xre family HTH (helix-turn-helix) domain (COG5642). Remarkably, the two tandem putative TA loci are located within a single 18-kb dnd island, details of which are archived within dndDB <ref type="figure">(Figure 1D)</ref> <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. Based on available data, the G. uraniireducens Rf4 dnd gene cluster (Gura_2472-2476) is likely to code for enzymes required for sequence-specific phosphorothioation of the DNA backbone <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. Consistent with a foreign origin, this 18-kb dnd island exhibits a lower G+C content (51%) than the genome average (54%) and codes for two likely transposase proteins (Gura_2461 and Gura_2462). Gura_2466, one of the island borne genes that lies close to the two TA loci, codes for an unusual 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase. This protein possesses one of the smallest enzyme subunits known <ref type="bibr">(28)</ref>. Bacteria belonging to the Geobacter genus are often the predominant species in a wide diversity of subsurface sediments under metalreducing conditions <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>. Given the abundance of phylogenetically diverse and functionally distinct TA loci within G. uraniireducens Rf4, it would be tempting to speculate that cumulative acquisition of TA loci and/or associated physically-linked mobile genetic DNA directly contributed to the environmental success and hardiness of Geobacter.</p>

Direct links to matching PubMed entries are also offered. At present this resource contains records of over 240 directly relevant scientific publications. This reference collection will be updated on a monthly basis with new entries being subject to subsequent manual curation and organization in a timely manner. The TADB reference collection has been sorted by the following headings: experimental studies, in silico analysis, protein structure data (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S2C)</ref>. TADB links the reviewed literatures to relevant TA loci, TA family, toxin domain, antitoxin domain and species pages as indicated by the corresponding thumbnail icons. The TADB reference collection is also searchable by TA family, author, title, journal, year, PubMed ID and matching abstracts can be subjected to standard word searches. This provides an easily accessible literature resource that has been subjected to both text mining and manual curation.</p>
            <p>As future developments, we will shortly be updating the records of experimentally verified TA loci with more functional information such as details of toxin targets, mechanisms of action of antitoxins, promoter, Shine-Dalgarno, terminator and identified TA loci regulators. Comparative analysis tool will also be incorporated into TADB to facilitate large scale synteny mapping of chromosomally encoded TA loci and their associated genomic islands. We are also exploring a pipeline, including the use of<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-24">RPSBLAST</rs>, to implement automated searches of annotated or unannotated genome sequences for presently undiscovered potential members of the TADB-recorded families.</p>

            <p>All the isolated VRE were typed using a high-resolution biochemical fingerprinting method, Phene plate (PhPlate) system, which is specifically developed for typing of enterococci strains (The PhPlate AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Microplates with 11 carbohydrate substrates were specifically chosen to differentiate between strains of enterococci. Preparation and inoculation of the plates were according to the manufacturer instruction. Briefly, a loopful of a fresh bacterial culture was inoculated in PhPlate growth media containing 0.2% (w/v) protease peptone, 0.05% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl and 0.011% (w/v) bromothymol blue. The plates were then incubated at 37°C and images of the plates were scanned after 16, 24 and 48 hours using an HP Scanjet 4890 scanner. After the final scan, the PhPlate software (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="fa02a17cad-software-0">PhPWin</rs> <rs corresp="#fa02a17cad-software-0" resp="#annotator8" type="version">4.2</rs>) was used to create the absorbance data (biochemical fingerprint) from the scanned images. The correlation coefficient using a pair-wise comparison of the biochemical fingerprints and clustered was determined according to the unweighted pair group method (UP-GMA) with arithmetic averages. The mean similarity between the compared isolated minus 2SD was taken as the ID-level of the system. Isolates showing similarity to each other above this level were considered as identical (Common Biochemical Phenotypes: C-BPT) (13).</p>

            <p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Hearts (n ¼ 2/group) were stopped with KCl, fixed in Zinc Fixative then embedded in paraffin. Next, they were cut cross-sectionally, stained in Hematoxylin and eosin or picosirus red (collagen), then viewed under polarized light. Livers from these animals were fixed, embedded and stained in a similar fashion, with the exception that oil red O was used for liver triglycerides. Images of each heart were captured at 20X. The cardiomyocyte diameter of 8e10 myocytes from 5 captured images per animal was analyzed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="eaad5a5ec4-software-1">Image J</rs> (<rs corresp="#eaad5a5ec4-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</rs>/) by an individual blinded to the treatment group.</p>
            <p>The technique applied has been modified from methods previously described <ref type="bibr">[96,97]</ref>. Briefly, w100 mg of cardiac tissue was excised and added to a petri dish with ice. The tissue was minced for 4e5 min, until it could pass through a pipette, and subjected to a brief (2 min) trypsin incubation. The mixture was transferred to a 50 mL conical tube and allowed to settle. The supernatant was removed and discarded. The remaining mixture was resuspended in 3 mL of Mitochondria Isolation Medium (MIM) (300 mM Sucrose, 10 mM Na-HEPES, 0.2 mM EDTA) with BSA, then transferred to a pre-chilled Dounce homogenizer and slowly homogenized for a total of w10e 12 counts. The homogenate was then subjected to a series of differential centrifugation steps. The fractions of isolated mitochondria obtained (mixed subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar) were resuspended in a small volume of MIM þ BSA and frozen at À80 for biochemical analysis.Membranes were incubated using infrared fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), scanned using Odyssey Clx Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor) and analyzed by densitometry using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="eaad5a5ec4-software-2">Image J</rs> (<rs corresp="#eaad5a5ec4-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NIH</rs>). The absolute quantities of GPx4 and HNE-modified protein adducts in human cardiac tissue was determined by a quantitative ELISA approach developed in our lab, as described previously <ref type="bibr">[54]</ref>.Portions of the labeled cardiac tissue homogenate were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel.

One way ANOVA was performed on continuous variables followed by NewmaneKeuls post test, with a &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant. In the human data analysis, categorical variables are presented as frequency and percentage and continuous variables were presented as mean AE standard deviation, mediation, median and interquartile range. Fisher exact and Chi (c 2 ) procedures were used to compute statistical significance of group comparisons for categorical variables. Deuchler-Wilcoxon was used for continuous variables. Biochemical variables were divided into quartiles (GPx4) or tertiles (HNE) and analyzed using a robust Poisson regression model (with relative risk as the measure of association). Missing values for all clinical and biochemical variable were imputed using the iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm as described in a recent study <ref type="bibr">[94]</ref>. Variables that were statistically significant in the univariable analysis were included into the multivariable analysis. P-value was computed using Friedman's Nonparametric test for central tendency while adjusting for age. P trend was computed using likelihood ratio trend test, adjusting for age and sex. Statistical significance was defined as P &lt; 0.05. <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="eaad5a5ec4-software-5">SAS</rs> Version <rs corresp="#eaad5a5ec4-software-5" resp="#curator" type="version">9.3</rs> was used for all analyses of human biochemical and clinical variables.</p>

After washing with Tween-containing PBS, the sample was treated at room temperature for 1 h with 500-fold diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with a fluorescence compound Cy3. After washing with Tween-containing PBS, the sample was treated with 10 ml of DAPI (4 0 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, 10 mg/ml) for 1 min for staining DNA, and covered with one drop of mountain medium (1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine and 90% glycerol in PBS, pH 9.0). The immuno-stained samples were observed with a fluorescence and phasecontrast microscope (100Âobjective lens; Olympus, Japan) equipped with a chilled, high sensitive digital CCD camera, Regita EXi (NIPPON ROPER, Japan), connected to a computer.

            <p>Primary comparisons were performed between the favorable and non-favorable groups. The data were expressed as the mean±standard deviation or as percentages. The categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 and the Fisher exact test. The continuous variables were compared using the two-tailed unpaired Student t-test for the variables with normal distributions, and the twotailed Mann-Whitney U test was used for the variables with non-normal distributions. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was then performed. The logistic regression coefficients were used to assess the odds ratios for each independent variable. The entire statistical analysis was performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fce29aaefe-software-0">SPSS</rs> ver. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> for Windows (<rs corresp="#fce29aaefe-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">IBM SPSS Inc</rs>., Armonk, NY, USA).

            <p>cDNA Library Construction and DNA Sequencing RNA isolation kit (Pharmacia) was used to extract the total RNA from cells grown under +Fe and ÀFe conditions, and contaminating genomic DNA was digested with DNase I. PolyA+ RNA was isolated using a PolyA+ tract mRNA isolation kit (Promega). Complementary DNA was synthesized using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit after priming with oligo-dT. The cDNA was then directionally cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene). Single and well-separated plaques were cored out from agar plates and transferred to 96-well microtiter plates containing SM buffer. The phage stocks were used as templates for cDNA insert amplification with T3 and T7 primers (1 nM for each primer). The amplified products were separated in 1.5% agarose gels, and clones that yielded single polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified bands were collected for sequencing. Single-pass sequencing from the 5 0 -end of the cDNA insert was initiated with a T3 primer using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The sequencing products were resolved and analysed on an ABI PRISM 377 (Applied Biosystems) or a MEGABACE DNA Sequencer (GE). The nucleotide sequences obtained were processed with the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b5b7835187-software-1">Phred/Phrap/ Consed package</rs> (<rs corresp="#b5b7835187-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed .html</rs>).</p>
            <p>Putative coding regions from the EST data were collected from <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b5b7835187-software-simple-2">BLASTX</rs> alignments, and the codon usage bias was calculated. A <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b5b7835187-software-simple-3">Perl script</rs> was also written to locate poly-A tails and to search 10-35 bp upstream for putative mRNA poly-adenylation signals; the script allowed one mismatch and two mismatches from the sequence AAUAAA. Putative signal sequences and transmembrane domains in the coding regions were identified by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b5b7835187-software-2">SignalP</rs> <rs corresp="#b5b7835187-software-2" resp="#annotator2" type="version">3.0</rs> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b5b7835187-software-3">TMHMM</rs> <rs corresp="#b5b7835187-software-3" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#b5b7835187-software-3" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www .cbs.dtu.dk/services</rs>/), respectively. Putative Trichomonas protein kinases and peptidases were identified by sequence comparison with datasets downloaded from the KinBase (http:// www.kinase.com) and the MEROPS (http://merops.sanger.ac .uk) databases, respectively.</p>
            <p>Oligonucleotide primers (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online) were designed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b5b7835187-software-5">Primer Designer</rs> software v<rs corresp="#b5b7835187-software-5" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.01</rs> (<rs corresp="#b5b7835187-software-5" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Scientific and Education software</rs>). The primers were tested prior to qRT-PCR analysis using DNA as a template, and single amplicons of the proper size were sequenced. The RT reaction contained 1 mg of total RNA, 500 ng of Oligo(dT) 15 Primer (Invitrogen), 5 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 2 U of RNasin (Invitrogen), 10 U of SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 500 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. The reactions were incubated at 42 C for 50 min followed by 15 min at 70 C. For qRT-PCR, 1 ml of cDNA was amplified in a 25 ml reaction mixture containing each gene-specific primer at 50 nM and 12.5 ml of iQTM SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad). All reactions were performed in triplicate using a RotorGene 2000 Real-Time PCR cycler (Corbett Life Science). The expression levels of each gene were normalized to those of the housekeeping gene b-tubulin, expression of which is not affected by the availability of iron. Relative quantitative values were obtained by the comparative threshold cycle (2 ÀÁÁC T ) method as described by <ref type="bibr">(Livak and Schmittgen 2001)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test if variables were to be normally distributed. A P value &gt;0.05 was required to assume a normal distribution. Data are expressed in terms of median and interquartile range in nonnormal distribution variables and as mean AE standard deviation in normal distribution variables. Comparisons between groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney test and Student t test. x 2 or Fisher exact tests were used to analyze the correlation between categorical variables. To calculate the relative correlation of the hs-CRP value, standardized coefficients (b) and 95% CIs were obtained using linear regression models. Univariate and stepwise linear regression analyses were used. The following factors were investigated: PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , CO, O 3 , PM 2.5 , age, PD duration, serum Cr level, white blood cell count (WBC), nPNA, serum albumin, serum total IS, serum total PCS, residual renal function test, intact parathyroid hormone level (iPTH), blood aluminum (Al) level, diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension. All the nominal variables in linear regression were transformed into dummy coding. Missing data was approached with listwise deletion.

It is a modular system (figure 1) that at the time of the study operated mainly in the outpatient and emergency departments, offering support services such as laboratory, imagery, pharmacy, social work and archive modules, the last of which is linked to SSPH's databases. The system allows physicians to record and retrieve the clinical history of patients, as well as all consultation data including drug prescriptions and laboratory studies requested. The system had not been fully implemented in the hospital environment at the time of the study, with working submodules only operating in admissions and the pharmacy department. The archive module also transfers administrative data for the management of the SSPH.</p>
            <p>Interviews were conducted by two native Spanish speaking female researchers with experience in qualitative research (August 3-19, 2011, in Colima state and September 1-19, 2011, in Mexico City). A group of experienced, Spanish speaking researchers from INSP and Tulane University read the interview and focus group transcripts to code the data and group them into key concepts and analytical axes. Some of the codes were generated according to the research questions, while others emerged from the interviews. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="cf9feb73e7-software-6">NVivo</rs> <rs corresp="#cf9feb73e7-software-6" resp="#annotator22" type="version">9.2</rs> software 22 was used to analyze the data around three analytical axes: design and development of the EHR ( planning and organization, criteria, and requirements), implementation of the EHR (users, constraints, and resources), and the impact of the EHR (benefits, recommendations, and vision for the future) (table 4). Each researcher coded separate interviews. Before starting, a coding exercise was conducted to make sure all researchers were interpreting the codes in the same way and there was constant discussion during the analysis to ensure there was agreement across researchers.</p>

The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare microcirculation at 60 and 360 minutes for the different zones for each group. In addition, we have performed a Freidman test for intragroup comparison for the different time intervals for each zone; P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

            <p>Blood was sampled on different occasions for assessment of a full set of hematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry parameters as well as cytokines and complement. Cytokines (IFNa, IFN-c, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-a) were assessed prior to dosing and at 2 and 7-8 h after dosing). For RTR2996, total complement activity (CH50) was assessed on day 15 before dosing and at 0.25 h and 24 h after dosing. Additionally, urine was collected in a metabolic cage for 16 h (RTR5001 and RTR4955) or for 24 h (RTR3649 and RTR2996), before first dosing and towards the end of the dosing period. Hematology parameters were determined using a Sysmex V R XT instrument (Sysmex, Japan), coagulation parameters with ACL TOP500 (Instrumentation Laboratory, USA), and clinical chemistry parameters with an Advia 180 (Siemens) automated system. Urinary chemistry parameters were measured with an Aution Max TM AX-4280 instrument (Arkray Clinical Diagnostics, USA) and an Advia 1800 (Siemens) automated system.

            <p>Normally distributed data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and comparisons between groups were performed using a Student's t-test. Abnormally distributed data were expressed as median and interquartile range (M, IQR), and comparisons between groups were performed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were presented as numerical data and percentages, statistical comparisons were conducted by a Chi-square (χ 2 ) test. In univariate analysis, variables with P &lt; 0.1 between survivals and deaths were considered as potential risk factors for mortality and included into a multivariable logistic regression model for adjustment. After every PLT index had been adjusted by clinical covariates, the ORs for mortality in patients with normal or abnormal PLT indices were presented. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was applied to test Goodness-of-fit properties. Collinearity was determined by variance inflation factor (VIF). The value of VIF more than 5 indicated the existence of multicollinearity. <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> Second, to explore the relationship between PLT indices and illness severity, we first divided each PLT index into tertiles of the normal range, higher than upper limit, lower than lower limit. Then, we plotted the distribution of APACHE II scores and SOFA scores in each tertile to investigate whether the patients with abnormal PLT indices were associated with higher illness scores. Third, to evaluate the performance of the PLT indices in predicting death events, we built the ROCs for every index and compared the area under the curves (AUC). We also calculated optimal cut-off point (where the Youden index reached the maximum value) <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> and the diagnostic parameters including sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic accuracy for each PLT index. Finally, to compare the prognosis in patient with normal and abnormal PLT indices, we used the KaplanMeier method to construct survival curves for the each group. Log-rank test was used for comparison of different survival curves between patients with normal and abnormal PLT indices.

            <p>Image accusation was performed essentially as described in <ref type="bibr">Meaburn et al. (2009)</ref>. Briefly, tissue sections were imaged with an IX70 (Olympus, Waltham, MA) DeltaVision (Applied Precision-GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) system, using a 60×/1.42 numerical aperture oil objective lens (Olympus) and an auxiliary magnification of 1.5. Image stacks were acquired with a 0.5-μm step interval along the z-axis. If mixed morphologies were present in a tissue section, before imaging, the tissue was visually inspected at low resolution (10× lens; Olympus) to identify malignant, normal, or hyperplastic regions. In these cases, hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue slides that had been marked by a pathologist (L.D.T.) were used as a guide to ensure correct classification of different regions of a tissue. Image stacks were deconvolved and converted into maximum intensity projections using SoftWoRx (Applied Precision). Image analysis was performed as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Meaburn et al., 2009)</ref>.

Of interest, FLI1 and MMP9 also reposition in breast cancer (unpublished data), suggesting that they are multitissue markers of cancer.

Selection of homology models was based on the location of extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). Only models where ECL2 was located relatively similarly to the available crystal structures of the ligand-bound GPCRs were considered for docking. Thus, ECL2 conformations that prevented entrance to the putative binding cavity were excluded for the next steps. The available model of FFA1 <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>, with the side-chain conformers optimized according to mutagenesis data for HisVI:16/4.56, ArgV:05/ 5.39, HisVI:20/6.55, and ArgVII:02/7.35, was used to optimize the rough homology models of hFFA2 and hFFA3 obtained.

            <p>To identify the "sections" of the phantom selected for the experiment, zinc oxide and eugenol dotted portions were added at each channel intersection <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>, and the letters A, B, C, and D and the numbers 1 through 10 were applied for identification <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref>). <ref type="bibr">6</ref> After obtaining the real measurements, the phantom was scanned in the i-CAT device, following an image acquisition protocol of a 6-cm × 16-cm field of view (FOV), 20 seconds, and a 0.2-mm voxel size. In the PreXion device, the phantom was scanned following an image acquisition protocol of 5-cm × 5-cm FOV, 19 seconds, and a 0.1-mm voxel size. Thereafter, multiplanar reformatting was performed, thereby obtaining axial sections with a thickness of 1.0 mm.

For each axial image, measurements were made in either horizontal direction (the A-B distance) and in either vertical direction (the C-D distance), twice, with a 1-week interval, by 4 examiners (4 oral radiologists) with 5 years or more experience in the use of these measuring tools.

            <p>SVM is a more sophisticated method; it is a very efficient learning algorithm for high-dimensional data in classification, regression and pattern recognition. The basis of SVM is to implicitly map data to a higher dimensional space via a kernel function in order to identify an optimal hyperplane that maximises the margin between the two groups. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> There are many software packages available to implement SVM. In this study, we use the<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="a489a5c0cc-software-simple-0">e1071-package of R</rs> with a default radial basis function kernel to obtain the prediction scores. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> CVs of the prediction models In our simulation study, we perform a total of 5000 simulations. In each simulation, a total of 100 random partitions are performed for each fold CV (LOOCV, 10-fold, 5-fold, 3-fold and 2-fold CVs, respectively). From these, we use the previously described learning curve to make a one-step extrapolation to the cross-validated AUC when all the samples are utilised to train the model. For a comparison, we also calculate the internally validated AUCs of the LOO bootstrap in each simulation. This is a modified bootstrap procedure of the ordinary bootstrap. We draw a total of 100 resamplings. At each draw, the observations left out serve as the testing set. The effective (non-overlapping) training sample size of the LOO bootstrap is around 63.2% of the total sample size. <ref type="bibr">17 18</ref> (Out-of-bag (OOB) <ref type="bibr">29</ref> estimation employs a majority vote on the multiple prediction made for observation i based on the bootstrap samples at each draw, while the LOO bootstrap takes an average on error of these predictions. Therefore, OOB estimation may have larger variability than the LOO bootstrap when the sample size is small. <ref type="bibr">30</ref>) In the simulation, we additionally create a large data set of 1000 cases and 1000 controls for external validation. For a prediction model, an externally validated AUC against this data set is considered as its true AUC value (one true AUC for each round of simulation). It should be pointed out that in real practice, one rarely has the luxury to conduct such a large-scale external validation, but will often have to settle for a satisfactory internal validation method which is precisely the focal point of this paper.</p>

            <p>HIV infection was determined via serologic testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed using Western blot assays. Plasma HIV RNA levels were quantified using nucleic-acid-sequence-based amplification commercial assays with a lower limit of quantification of 80 copies/mL (bioMérieux), and total peripheral CD4 1 T cell counts were measured with standard flow cytometric methods. T cell activation and senescence were measured by immunophenotyping performed at the University of California, San Francisco, Core Immunology Laboratory, using methods that have been optimized and validated for frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cryopreserved PBMCs were rapidly thawed in warm medium, washed, stained with Viacount (Millipore), and run on a Guava PCA (Millipore) to determine cell number and viability. Samples with viability of ,40% were not analyzed. PBMCs were stained with aqua amine reactive dye (Invitrogen) to exclude nonviable cells and for surface expression of CD3, CD28 (BD Pharmingen), CD4, CD38, HLA-DR (BD Biosciences), CD8 (Invitrogen), and CD57 (Biolegend). Stained cells were run on a customized BD LSR II and data analyzed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fecb93d216-software-1">FlowJo</rs> software, version <rs corresp="#fecb93d216-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">8.8.4</rs> (<rs corresp="#fecb93d216-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Tree Star</rs>) to quantitate CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells expressing activation (CD38 and HLA-DR) and senescence (CD28 2 and CD57 1 ) markers <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p>

Standard lymphocyte and singlet gates were drawn to exclude debris, monocytes, and doublets. Dead cells were excluded by gating on aqua amine reactive dye-negative cells, and total T cells were defined by CD3 1 staining. Fluorescence-minus-1 controls were used to set T cell subpopulation gates. The mean peripheral blood mononuclear cell viability was 75.0% in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women and 77.5% in HIV-uninfected women.c Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of &gt;140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of &gt;90 mm Hg, or prior diagnosis of hypertension. Dyslipidemia was defined as LDL-C level of .160 mg/dL or HDL-C level of ,40 mg/dL. Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose level of .126 mg/dL or prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus with or without the use of antidiabetic medications. Family history of coronary disease was defined as a female first-degree relative with myocardial infarction or angina before age 65 or male first-degree relative with myocardial infarction or angina before age 55.In contrast to the findings among HIV-infected women, we did not observe an association between T cell activation and increased prevalence of carotid lesions among HIV-uninfected women <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). Models that included interaction terms provided evidence of effect modification by HIV status, such that higher levels of T cell activation were associated with carotid lesions in the HIV-infected group but not in the HIV-uninfected group (significance tests for interaction, P 5 .06 for CD4 1 T cell activation and P 5 .02 for CD8 1 T cell activation). <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). When we repeated the analysis using CD28 2 alone rather than CD28Models that included interaction terms were consistent with the hypothesis that higher levels of CD8 1 T cell senescence were associated with carotid lesions in the HIV-infected group but not in the HIV-uninfected group (significance test for interaction, P 5 .009). In contrast to the findings for the outcome of carotid lesions, cIMT measurements were not associated with T cell activation or senescence markers in either HIV-infected women <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref> or HIV-uninfected women (data not shown).</p>

            <p>The CAD system 11 was used to select two regions of interest (ROIs), the 'non-cleft side' and 'cleft side'. The CAD algorithm was implemented by a technical computing language (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d3bb2cc0ab-software-0">MATLAB</rs> <rs corresp="#d3bb2cc0ab-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">R2010a</rs>, <rs corresp="#d3bb2cc0ab-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">MathWorks Inc</rs>., Natick, MA, USA). The ROI, a square portion of 64×64 pixels, was extracted by dragging the mouse from a randomly selected single point to 64 pixels left and 64 pixels downward. The tooth structure, periodontal ligament, and lamina dura were excluded from each ROI. Next, the noise was removed by median filtering. Morphological skeletonization was then used to extract the medial axis of the trabecular bone, which was regarded as the prominent region that was brighter than the surrounding structures, and subsequently, the images were enlarged 64-fold. The 'strel' function was selected from the computing language to] is the size. In the matrix [2 3], the first element was the number of rows in the structuring element neighbourhood; the second element was the number of columns. Then, the most basic morphological operations, which were 'erosion' and 'dilation,' were performed. The 'erosion' function removed pixels on the object boundaries, while dilation added pixels to the boundaries of objects in an image. The number of pixels added or removed from the objects in an image depends on the size and the shape of the structuring element used to process the image. Finally, the pixel area calculation was used to estimate the area of the trabecular bone in the binary image, that is, the digital image that had only two possible values for each pixel, namely 0 and 1 <ref type="figure">(Figs. 1 and 2)</ref>. The pixel area of the "non-cleft side" and "cleft side" from group 0 to group 4 were calculated and compared. The measurements were made five times, once a week, on each side by an oral radiologist. Five positions were randomly selected at the "non-cleft side" and "cleft side" on the same image. All of the pixel areas of the image were then calculated. Statistical tests were performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d3bb2cc0ab-software-1">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#d3bb2cc0ab-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">10.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#d3bb2cc0ab-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were applied. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate a normally distributed pixel area. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used when the data did not show normal distribution and the paired samples t test was used when the data showed normal distribution. The study design was approved by the Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee for Human Research.</p>
            <p>Alveolar bone grafting in patients with cleft lip and palate is now a common practice owing to several advantages. It can help to prevent the collapse and constriction of the dental arch, to close the oronasal fistula, and to allow eruption of teeth into the cleft. The bone grafting is fully revascularized between 14 and 21 days, and new bone is formed in approximately six weeks and has matured after six months. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> It is generally thought that osseous healing of transplants is completed six months after the operation. Nightingale et al compared three methods of radiographic assessment, the Bergland, Kindelan, and Chelsea scales, which produced great reproducibility rather than validity. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Over-and under-estimation of the success rate of the alveolar bone grafting has also been reported in some cases. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> The CAD system, therefore, has been developed to determine the bone quantity in the alveolar cleft after bone grafting. This CAD system uses mathematical morphology and calculates the area on the binary images that can be produced by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d3bb2cc0ab-software-simple-6">MathWorks</rs>. Our results showed that the pixel areas from the binary images in the "cleft side" were significantly smaller than those on the "non-cleft side" in group 0 (before bone grafting) and group 1 (one month after bone grafting). This means that the trabecular bone increased but was still less than the normal side. In addition, there was no significant difference found in group 2 (2-4 months after bone grafting) and group 3 (5-7 months after bone grafting), which means the trabecular bone gradually increased in the 2-4 months and was similar to the normal bone within 5-7 months. It should be noted that the new bone formation with osteoid deposition indicated remodeling of 25-55% at 3 months postoperatively and the grafted bone had a denser structure than the control ─ 228 ─ Evaluation of alveolar bone grafting in unilateral cleft lip and palate patients using a computer-aided diagnosis systemspecimen from the iliac crest. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> The histomophometric analysis has shown that major bone remodeling can already be seen after 4-5 months. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> However, the pixel area presented a significant difference again in group 4 (8 or more months after bone grafting), which means the quantity of bone had decreased after eight months. Honma et al also reported that the grafted bone volumes one year after alveolar bone grafting were significantly reduced compared with 3 months after grafting using CT. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Therefore, longterm follow-up is suggested to evaluate the trabecular bone at the bone grafting area in comparison to the side with normal bone. Dental radiographs may be used with the CAD system to evaluate the bone grafting area more easily than CT images and show cost-effectiveness.</p>
            <p>The CAD system was developed based on mathematical morphology using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d3bb2cc0ab-software-simple-7">MathWorks</rs>. The ROI can be controlled by using the same size and can be changed into binary images for calculating the pixel area that corresponds to the total number of pixels in the image. The CAD system could be useful for evaluating grafting failure, which would permit re-grafting before the eruption of the teeth and improve the prognosis of cleft lip and palate patients. Trindade et al <ref type="bibr">8</ref> and Jia et al <ref type="bibr">17</ref> showed 86% and 88% success rates, respectively, for the long term outcome of alveolar bone grafting in a UCLP group using the Bergland scale. However, their studies did not evaluate the success rate. A further prospective study would be required using this CAD system to support surgeons to determine the appropriate period for re-grafting or to explain the success of bone grafting compared with normal bone on the same image. The quantity of the pixel area might be useful for further and better treatment planning for artificial eruption in the cleft area.</p>

            <p>Finally, we used multivariate logistic regression to examine the combined effects of household income, diet intakes, and PA on overweight and obesity. Four models were performed by consecutively including predictors of overweight and obesity. Firstly, we included household income and year (Model 1). Subsequently, dietary energy intake was added (Model 2). Next moderate and vigorous PA was also included (Model 3). Sedentary activity was finally included (Model 4). To interpret odds ratios (ORs), we simulated the predicted prevalence of overweight and obesity if all subjects had the diet and PA profiles of the low-, medium-, or high-income levels in 1997 and 2009. Although the CHNS is longitudinal in nature, the present study focused on cross-sectional analysis of data in 1997 and 2009.

            <p>Monoseptic nl-reactors harboring one colony only were enriched by COPAS sorting employing the '<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="faeeedd7fc-software-simple-0">Profiler</rs>' software <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>. Pulse shape diagram recording was triggered by the opacity signal [threshold &gt;25 AU (arbitrary units); signal gain factor 1.5; measuring range 0-65500 AU]. nlReactor size is expressed as time-of-flight [(ToF); gated range 400-750 ToF, arbitrary units]. Fluorescence signals for colony detection were generally recorded at 510 nm, which is the emission maximum of the employed GFP [ex 488 nm, photon multiplier settings (PMT) 800 V; gain factor 1.0; measuring range 0-65 500 AU; peakprofiling was initiated at &gt;20 000 AU; gated range 60 000-65 500]. The COPAS-device was operated at an average frequency of 30 Hz and coincidence settings for dispensing into microtiter plates were adjusted to 'pure'-mode which guarantees that nl-reactors are only sortedout if no other reactor is coincidentally within the same droplet. A detailed description of the cell encapsulation, proliferation and isolation procedure employed for enrichment of monoseptic nl-reactors by COPAS, was published elsewhere <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>.</p>
            <p>A total number of 20 000 enriched monoseptical nl-reactors were suspended in a 50 ml Falcon tube in 10 ml of ddH 2 O. The cells were lyzed by heat (10 min in a water bath at 968C). The microcarriers were washed once in 50 ml washing solution and three times in 50 mL ddH 2 O and directly added to a poly(fluoro acrylate) PCR-bag (Welch Fluorocarbon, Dover, NH; 100 Â 100 mm; thickness: 50 mm) containing 10 ml PCR reagent [ddH 2 O containing: 1 M betaine; 5% DMSO; 1 Â PCR buffer; 0.1 mM BaCl 2 ; 0.2 mM of each dNTPs; 0.2 mM primer M13F (-21); 0.2 mM primer GA 9 ; 700 U Taq polymerase; Genscript, Piscataway, NJ]. All gas bubbles were removed, the PCR-bag was air-tightly sealed, and cycled on a custom-built flat-screen thermocycler that consisted of a chamber flanked by aluminum plates which contained channels for water circulation for temperature control (32 cycles; 90 s at 968C; 180 s at 558C) exerted by two waterbaths (Huber Polystat CC3; set to 968C and 568C, respectively). Numerically, controlled thermo-switching between the two water cycles was realized with four valves (m&amp;m international, Bedford, UK) controlling the in-and outlet of the water baths and a customized <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="faeeedd7fc-software-2">LabView</rs> (<rs corresp="#faeeedd7fc-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Instruments</rs>; Austin; TX) program controlling the relayswitch station USB-Erb24 (Measurement Computing Corp., Norton, MA). After cycling, the beads were recovered from the bag by sieving, washed with 50 ml washing solution and 250 ml ddH 2 O and suspended in a Petri dish with 20 ml washing solution containing 1Â SYBR Green I dye (Invitrogen; Carlsbad; CA) in order to stain PCRproducts prior to another COPAS analysis. Microscopic pictures were taken by a Zeiss Axio Star Plus fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss AG; Go¨ttingen; Germany) using an excitation filter at 488 nm and an emission long-pass filter &gt;520 nm in combination with phase contrast microscopy.</p>

            <p>Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for evacetrapib were calculated by using standard noncompartmental methods of analysis using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="aa74c3ecc8-software-0">WinNonlin</rs> software, v.<rs corresp="#aa74c3ecc8-software-0" resp="#annotator4" type="version">6.2.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#aa74c3ecc8-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Pharsight Corp</rs>., Mountain View, CA). The primary parameters for analysis were area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last time point with a measurable concentration (AUC 0-tlast ); AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞ ); maximum observed drug concentration (C max ); and the time to reach maximum concentration (T max ). The AUC was calculated by using a combination of the linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods (linear-log trapezoidal rule). The linear trapezoidal method was applied up to T max , and then the logarithmic trapezoidal method was used after T max . The minimum requirement for the calculation of AUC was the inclusion of at least three consecutive plasma concentrations above the lower level of quantitation, with at least one of these concentrations following C max . The C max and T max were reported from visual inspection of the concentration versus time curve. The apparent terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), apparent clearance, and apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase were also estimated. The t 1/2 was calculated, when appropriate, based on the apparent terminal log-linear portion of the concentration-time curve. The start of the terminal elimination phase for each subject was determined by visual inspection and generally was the first point at which there was no systematic deviation from the log-linear decline in plasma concentrations. The t 1/2 was estimated only when at least three concentrations were available for its calculation in the terminal phase. Descriptive statistics, including geometric mean and coefficient of variation (CV), were calculated.</p>
            <p>The effects of gastric pH on evacetrapib AUC 0-∞ and C max were analyzed by using a mixed-effects analysis of variance model. Parameters were log-transformed prior to analysis. The model included a fixed effect for treatment (evacetrapib alone or evacetrapib + omeprazole) and a random effect for subject. The ratios of geometric least-squares (LS) means for evacetrapib + omeprazole (test treatment) compared with evacetrapib alone (reference treatment) were calculated along with the 90% CIs of the ratios. The ratios of geometric LS means were considered statistically significant if the 90% CIs did not contain 1. The T max for evacetrapib was analyzed by using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="aa74c3ecc8-software-simple-3">SAS</rs> procedure PROC UNI- VARIATE software. The median of differences and~90% CI for the median of differences between evacetrapib + omeprazole and evacetrapib alone were calculated. The difference in T max was considered statistically significant if the 90% CI did not contain zero.</p>

We used an imaging protocol that maximizes differentiation of the white and gray matter boundary (3D spoiled gradient-recalled at steady state, TE 3.0 ms, TR 7.8 ms, TI 600, 8° flip angle, NEX 1, 1-mm axial slice thickness, FOV 25.6 cm, 256 × 256 matrix). MRIs for each participant were motion corrected, normalized for intensity in homogeneities, and transformed to Talairach space. Non-brain tissue was removed using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure, subcortical structures were segmented, and further intensity normalization was conducted. This was followed by white-matter segmentation, tessellation of the gray-white matter boundary, and automated topology correction. Finally, surface deformation following intensity gradients optimally placed the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class. The cerebral cortex was parcellated into 34 gyral-based regions in each hemisphere based on the Desikan-Killiany atlas <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref>. Subcortical structures were delineated by an algorithm that examines variations in voxel intensities and spatial relationships. Anatomical accuracy of the segmentations was manually verified. To account for differences in head size, volumes for each region were divided by intracranial volume (ICV).</p>

            <p>13 C]-palmitate in pig brain. To validate the biodistribution of both <ref type="bibr">[</ref> 18 F]-FTHA and [ 13 C]-palmitate in brain, we used data from in vivo pig <ref type="bibr">[</ref> 18 F]-FTHA biodistribution study <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>, and completed the study by analyzing the biodistribution of stable [ 13 C]-palmitate from frozen brain samples obtained from the same animals. The study protocol and analysis of <ref type="bibr">[</ref> 18 F]-FTHA has been described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>, and the palmitate information is provided in an online appendix in an online appendix available at http://diabetes.diabetesjournals. org/cgi/content/full/db09-0138/DC1. The results are provided in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Roughly 62% from [ 13 C]-palmitate and 69% from [ 18 F]-FTHA was found in brain lipids. Most of the [ 13 C]-palmitate in brain lipids was found in phospholipids, and only trace amounts were found in triglycerides and fatty acids. <ref type="bibr">[</ref> 18 F]-FTHA was found mostly in triglycerides. PET studies. Patients were scanned in the fasting state, and they refrained from drinks containing caffeine, smoking, and all medications for 12 h before the PET scan. Studies were performed in a supine position. Two catheters were inserted in the antecubital veins of different arms: one for saline infusion and tracer injection, and another for blood sampling. <ref type="figure">TN)</ref> and GE Advance (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) were in use when this tracer was divided. The second study was scanned with same camera-protocol as the first study. Data were corrected for dead-time, decay, and photon attenuation. PET images were reconstructed in GE Advance using a 128 ϫ 128 matrix with a 30-cm field of view (FOV) in three-dimensional (3D) mode and Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstruction, in Siemens HRϩ using 128 ϫ 128 matrix with zoom two (28.8 cm FOV) in 3D mode and FBP reconstruction and in PET-CT using 128 ϫ 128 matrix with 35 cm FOV in 3D mode and Iterative Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) reconstruction (VUEPoint). Calculation of the parametric fractional uptake rate image. Brain fractional uptake indexes for [ 11 C]-palmitate and [ 18 F]-FTHA were calculated by dividing the brain radioactivity by the integral of the plasma unmetabolized radioactivity curve at 15 min. The modeling gives results that are independent of the injected tracer dose. The fractional uptake rate (FUR) image from dynamic brain scanning was calculated from 10 -20 min. Analysis of PET images. The detailed description of regional and voxel level PET image analyses and statistical analyses of regional FUR estimates are provided in the online appendix. All values are expressed as mean Ϯ SD. P values Ͻ 0.05 are considered statistically significant. Biochemical analyses. Details of biochemical analyses are provided in the online appendix.

            <p>Western blot assay. The cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer supplemented with RIPA 10 µl/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a protease inhibitor, and protein concentrations were determined by a Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein assay kit. All of these reagents were purchased from the Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), which were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 2 h before being incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4˚C. The membranes were subsequently incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The protein bands were visualized by an Enhanced Chemiluminescence Detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and photographed by a Gel Logic 2200 PRO imaging system. The following primary antibodies were used in this experiment: an MTDH rabbit mAbsiRNA interference and stable knockdown cell line establishment. Four siRNA sequences targeting human MTDH mRNA were designed using RNAi designer (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="c16bdb5b4d-software-0">Oligo</rs> <rs corresp="#c16bdb5b4d-software-0" resp="#annotator7" type="version">6.0</rs> software). A scrambled sequence of targeting MTDH sequences was used as a negative control. The control siRNA (MTDH-con si) targeting sequence was 5'-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACG UTT-3', the MTDH-siRNA#1 (si#1) targeting sequence was 5'-GCUGUUCGAACACCUCAAATT-3', the MTDHsiRNA#2 (si#2) targeting sequence was 5'-GCCGUAAUCA ACCCUAUAUTT-3' , and the MTDH-siRNA#3 (si#3) targeting sequence was 5'-GCCAUCUGUAAUCUUAUCATT-3'. The most effective siRNA sequence was selected, after which a hairpin structure (shRNA) was added to it. A recombinant lentivirus containing the corresponding MTDH-shRNA construct was subsequently produced via co-transfection of 293T cells with helper plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2G) with Lipofier (HanBio, Shanghai, China). After 48 h of transfection, the cultured supernatant was harvested, filtered and concentrated by ultra centrifugation. To establish stable MTDH-knockdown cell lines, we transduced the MKN45 and AGS cell lines with lentiviral RNAi vectors. After 72 h, the cells were treated with 2 µg/ml puromycin. The puromycin-resistant clones were selected and expanded for subsequent experiments.</p>

            <p>Neuroblastoma two-color gene-expression profiles All two-color gene-expression of the MAQC-II training set were generated using a customized 2 Â 11K neuroblastomarelated microarray. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Furthermore, 20 patients of the MAQC-II two-color validation set were also profiled utilizing this microarray. Two-color profiles of the remaining patients of the MAQC-II validation set were performed using a slightly revised version of the 2 Â 11K microarray. For this version V2.0 of the array, 100 oligonucleotide probes of the original design were removed due to consistent low expression values (near background) observed in the training set profiles, and 200 novel oligonucleotide probes were added. These minor modifications of the microarray design resulted in a total of 9986 probes present on both versions of the 2 Â 11K microarray. The experimental protocol did not differ between both sets, and gene-expression profiles were performed as described. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> In summary, 1 mg of total RNA of each tumor sample was linearly amplified and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, using Agilent's Low-RNA-Input LinearAmp Kit.

Hybridization was performed for 17 h at 60 1C in a rotating hyb oven at a speed of 4 rounds per minute (r.p.m.). Washing was performed at room temperature following the manufacturer's protocol.

            <p>Single-color gene-expression profiles were generated for 478/499 neuroblastoma samples of the MAQC-II dual-color training and validation set (training set 244/246; validation set 234/253). For the remaining 21 samples no single-color data was available due to either shortage of tumor material of these patients (n ¼ 15), poor experimental quality of the generated single-color profiles (n ¼ 5) or correlation of one single-color profile to two different dual-color profiles for the one patient profiled with both versions of the 2 Â 11K microarrays. Single-Color gene-expression profiles were generated using customized 4 Â 44K oligonucleotide microarrays produced by Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA). These 4 Â 44K microarrays included all probes represented by Agilent's Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray and all probes of the version V2.0 of the 2 Â 11K customized microarray that were not present in the former probe set. Labeling and hybridization was performed following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 1 mg total of tumor RNA was linearily amplified and labeled with Cy3 using Agilent's one-color Quick Amp Labeling Kit following the instructions of the protocol. Then, 1650 ng of Cy3-labeled cRNA was hybridized on the 4 Â 44K arrays using Agilent's High-RPM Gene Expression Hyb Kit. Hybridization was performed for 17 h at 65 1C in a rotating hyb oven at 10 r.p.m. according to the company's recommendations.

Images were taken when a field of view (9400 objective) contained a neutrophil elastase expressor and one or both of the Campylobacter expressors. A record was made of any neutrophil elastase expressors that did not have a Campylobacter expressor in the same field, as well as the overall presence of C. jejuni and thermophilic Campylobacter. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="fe13018f67-software-1">Image J</rs> software (<rs corresp="#fe13018f67-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</rs>) was used after images had been captured to allow automated measurement of the distance between two points selected by the user-neutrophil and Campylobacter. The distance was measured in pixels on the digital images. The maximum field size used was 1850 pixels. The use of this software allowed multiple accurate measurements to be taken and compiled for statistical analysis.</p>

A significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the presence of C. coli. This in itself is simply an observation and merely demonstrates an increased presence of C. coli in cats with neutrophilic inflammation. However, FISH neutrophil elastase probes demonstrated close proximity to neutrophils and confirmed the possible association with C. coli. No association between neutrophil location and other species of bacteria was demonstrated. This association supports the hypothesis that C. coli is particularly associated with a specific neutrophilic form of inflammation in the duodenal mucosa of cats with enteric disease compared with other microorganisms.</p>

            <p>Immunohistochemistry for c-Fos: Brains were further fixed for 48 hr at 4°C in the fixative paraformaldehyde solution and then submerged in 10% sucrose solution overnight, 20% sucrose solution for 24 hr and 30% sucrose for 48 hr until the brain completely sank. Brain sections of 30 µm thickness were cut using a cryostat (Microm HM550, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) and collected serially in 24-well plates containing PBS (0.02 M, pH 7.2).

To correct for multiple hypothesis testing, we obtained adjusted p values by using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate procedure <ref type="bibr">(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)</ref>, adjusted p-value 0.2 significance level is used. An overview of the test results was shown as a Manhattan plot constructed by the statistical package R. Base pair position of SNP markers were given based on the chicken genome assembly build WASHUC2. Inflation factor was calculated by the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f30dc5d529-software-simple-1">R package GenABEL</rs> with "median" option <ref type="bibr">(Aulchenko et al., 2007)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The genome-wide association study revealed 12 significantly associated SNPs that surpassed the significance level <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). As genomic inflation factor is 0.987, it can be concluded that the GWAS result is not inflated by considering relatedness using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="f30dc5d529-software-simple-2">GEMMA</rs> <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). Among the significant SNPs, we identified 4 susceptibility SNPs: rs14339964 (Gga3:36327458, p = 4.07 10 -9 ), GGaluGA344987 (Gga3:705798, p = 1.1210 -6 ),) in the population <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. SNP rs14339964 at Gga3:36327458 is located in an intron region of AKT3 which is known to be regulators of cell signaling in response to insulin and growth factors and involved in a wide variety of biological processes. AKT3 is one of the key genes in the formation of melanoma cells <ref type="bibr">(Tsao et al., 2012)</ref>. Previous studies reported that through gene-environment interactions pigmentation pathways can contribute to the formation for melanoma and tumours <ref type="bibr">(Gudbjartsson et al., 2008; Ibarrola- Villava et al., 2012)</ref>. Thus, we indirectly infer that AKT3 mutations may be related to plumage pigmentation. Both SNPs, GGaluGA344987 at Gga3:705798 and rs14641648 at Gga8:12987908, are located in an intergenic region around KRT7 and PAP2 which are associated with pigmentation. PAP2 is another name of LPPR5 which has been found to <ref type="table">Tail</ref> increase pigmentation <ref type="bibr">(Shan et al., 2009</ref>). KRT7 is a member of the keratin gene family and is related with melanocytic tumors <ref type="bibr">(Blum et al., 2010)</ref>. DDX6 encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family, which has multiple functions including translation suppression and mRNA degradation <ref type="bibr">(Weston and Sommerville, 2006)</ref>. DDX6 is a previously confirmed gene for vitiligo which is a disease related with pigmentation of skin <ref type="bibr">(Tang et al., 2012)</ref>. Interestingly, although rs15175679 (Gga20: 8397089, p = 3.9110 -6 ) is not significant, the variant exits in gga-mir-668 which is a region that harbors a small RNA. Previous studies of chicken embryogenesis has shown that this small RNA regulates developmental signaling pathways <ref type="bibr">(Shao et al., 2012)</ref>. The results of GWAS of head plumage, wing plumage, breast plumage, back plumage, neck plumage and tail plumage traits, separately identified the same SNPs: rs14339964 and rs15616451 (near gene: AKT3, ENSGALG00000020136) as the result of GWAS with the whole body trait. Through the concordant result, we infer that quantitative analysis of whole body plumage is not a simple trait <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>.</p>

            <p>In order to investigate further whether 5-FU hollow microspheres could enhance its oral bioavailability and improve pharmacokinetic behaviors, 5-FU hollow microspheres and its solid microspheres and powder as the control groups were orally administrated to rabbits at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. The mean plasma drug concentration-time curve is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> and the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters calculated by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="c56176d67a-software-1">DAS</rs> <rs corresp="#c56176d67a-software-1" resp="#annotator14" type="version">2.0</rs> software are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>, 5-FU hollow microspheres demonstrated the greatest absorption and the slowest elimination after gavage administration in comparison with its solid microspheres and powder. The C max and T max of 5-FU solid microspheres and powder were 2.25±0.22 mg/L and 1.00±0.15 hours, and 2.55±0.19 mg/L and 0.75±0.11 hours, respectively; the plasma drug concentration was detectable up to 12 and 8 hours, whereas theC max and T max of hollow microspheres were 1.64±0.21 mg/L and 2.00±0.22 hours, respectively. At 24 hours after gavage administration of 5-FU hollow microspheres, the drug concentration in plasma was still detectable at about 0.13±0.02 mg/L. These results suggested that 5-FU from hollow microspheres possessed slower drug release or absorption relatively.</p>

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and one-way repeated ANOVA for repeated data were conducted. The aim of the one-way ANOVA was to compare the averages of several physiological parameters relative to the groups; a difference in the mean physiological parameter values of the three groups would result in a statistical difference between subjects classified as heteroschematic male, isoschematic, and heteroschematic female. Accordingly, the calculated P-value would be less than the adopted significance level (5%).</p>

Three survival outcomes were tested; TTBR, PFS and OS. All time intervals were measured in relation to the commencement of BRAF inhibitor. Follow-up for patients who subsequently received dabrafenib and trametinib combination (CombiDT) therapy (n ¼ 5) was censored at date of cross-over to CombiDT therapy, as response rates of 19% and a median PFS of 3.6 months have been reported in this patient population <ref type="bibr">(Flaherty et al, 2011)</ref>. Follow-up for one patient who discontinued therapy after best response but before progressive disease was censored at date of BRAF inhibitor cessation. Multivariate survival models were also tested for PFS and OS in the overall cohort adjusting for age, sex, presence of active (untreated, or previously treated but relapsed) brain metastases (BM), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and ongoing treatment with BRAF inhibitor after RECISTdefined disease progression. Pearson's correlation and MannWhitney U-methods were used to test all staining parameters for association with best CT response in terms of best per cent change (sum of diameters target lesions baseline to best response) and also coded categorically as a partial response; no patient experienced a complete response. A subgroup response and survival correlate analysis was conducted excluding patients who had BM at trial commencement.</p>

            <p>The MBS was analysed by using specific item numbers for 25(OH)D testing, bone densitometry (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) and a commonly requested reference test, full blood count (FBC). The latter was used as a control for pathology test utilisation as it is unlikely to have been influenced by topical health trends. For individuals who had one to five tests, we used analysis of variance adjusting for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni post hoc tests to determine whether there was a significant difference in the mean number of individuals being tested each year by quarter (not including duplicate tests) for each test frequency. All analyses were performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="b09b2ee1dd-software-0">SPSS</rs> V <rs corresp="#b09b2ee1dd-software-0" resp="#curator" type="version">19</rs>. Of the total number of tests, 54% of tests were initial tests and the remaining 46% of tests were subsequent tests, 25% of which were for the second test, 11% the third test and 6% the forth test. The remaining 6% of 25(OH)D tests were for between 5 and 79 tests in that period. Although we were able to distinguish between GP versus specialist, the data were not specific enough to determine if the same provider was performing each test.</p>

            <p>Seedlings were harvested 1, 3, and 5 d after treatment. Glucosinolates were extracted and analysed as previously described, with minor modifications <ref type="bibr">(Sun et al., 2011a, b)</ref>. Fresh tissues (100 mg) were boiled in 1 ml of water for 10 min. After recovery of the liquid, the residues were washed with water (1 ml), and the combined aqueous extract was applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (30 mg) column (pyridine acetate form). The column was washed three times with 20 mM pyridine acetate and twice with water. The glucosinolates were converted into their desulpho analogues by overnight treatment with 100 µl of 0.1% (1.4 U) aryl sulphatase, and the desulphoglucosinolates were eluted with 2 × 0.5 ml of water. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed using Shimadzu HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), consisting of two LC-20AT solvent delivery units, a DGU-20A3 degasser, a CTO-10ASVP column oven, an SIL-20A autosampler, and an SPD-M20A diode array detector.

            <p>First we calculate the descriptive statistics for all independent variables for the total sample, as well as two subsamples: those who never experienced a pregnancy scare, and those who experienced a pregnancy scare <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. Independent samples' t-tests indicate whether the independent variables are statistically different in the two subsamples. Next we investigate these characteristics in a multivariate context, using logistic regression for models of experiencing any pregnancy scare, and Poisson regression for models of the number of pregnancy scares <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. Lastly, we estimate hazard models, implemented using logistic regression, to illustrate the relationship between a pregnancy scare and subsequent unintended pregnancy <ref type="table">(Table 4</ref>). All analyses were conducted in <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="b1c70ff562-software-0">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#b1c70ff562-software-0" resp="#annotator18" type="version">12.1</rs> using the logit, poisson, and xtlogit commands. The hazard models were estimated with xtlogit to account for the clustering effect of multiple journals per respondent. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows that, overall, sociodemographic characteristics associated with disadvantage are overrepresented in the subsample of young women who experienced a pregnancy scare. For example, while only 32% of those who did not experience a pregnancy scare are African American, 54% of those who experienced a pregnancy scare are African American. Also, young women with early pregnancy-related experiences are overrepresented in the pregnancy scares subsample.</p>

            <p>For cryoEM, aliquots of IC and EC were applied onto glow-discharged, holey carbon grids (carbon-coated Quantifoil R 1.2/ R1.3 300 mesh grids) containing an additional continuous thin layer of carbon, and plunged into liquid ethane. Images were acquired under minimal dose conditions with a Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope at 200 kV. The images were taken at magnification of ∼110 000 using a 16 megapixel (Mpx) FEI Eagle CCD camera with a step size of 15 m, thus the original pixel size of the acquired images was 1.37Å. Cryo-EM micrographs were downsampled by a factor of 2 or 3 (EC and IC, respectively). The contrast transfer function of the each acquired image was estimated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e7c10367e1-software-6">CTFFIND</rs> <rs corresp="#e7c10367e1-software-6" resp="#annotator2" type="version">3</rs> program (16) and corrected at the micrograph level. Individual particles were selected manually and extracted using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e7c10367e1-software-simple-2">XMIPP</rs> software (17) (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S</ref> <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>) were carried out with normalized particles. Homogeneous populations were obtained and averaged for a final two-dimensional (2D) characterization.</p>
            <p>Several starting reference models and initial 3D reconstruction steps based on iterative angular refinement were performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e7c10367e1-software-simple-3">EMAN</rs> software package <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. In general the initial volumes were created upon the class averages generated in the previous step, using a common lines approach or by using artificial noisy models and Gaussian blobs with the rough dimensions of the protein complexes. In the case of the streptavidin labeled complexes and those complexes analyzed by cryo-EM, the previously obtained EM maps of non-labeled or negatively-stained complexes were filtered to 70Å, and used as the initial models. The different strategies converged to similar solutions, and one of the models was selected to complete the refinement (Supplementary Figure S2C). However, in the case of heterogeneity (EC cryo-EM; streptavidin-biotin labeled ICs) the most stable model was subjected to maximum likelihood 3D classification (<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e7c10367e1-software-simple-4">ML3D</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref> to address this problem. The separated particles were processed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e7c10367e1-software-simple-5">EMAN</rs> and the whole 3D reconstruction cycle was repeated de novo. The resolution of the reconstructions was determined by the FSC 0.5 criterion (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S3</ref>), and these values were used to low-pass filter the final volumes. The visualization of density maps and atomic structures was performed using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e7c10367e1-software-simple-6">UCSF Chimera</rs> <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>.

            <p>Genotyping and copy number variant detection. Highdensity single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays (HumanCoreExome-12 v1-0; Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used to detect the presence of CNVs from genomic DNA. Arrays were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize false-positives, CNVs were called using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c51917cc77-software-0">Nexus Copy Number</rs> package (<rs corresp="#c51917cc77-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">BioDiscovery Inc</rs>, Hawthorne, CA) from signal intensity data after preprocessing in <rs corresp="#c51917cc77-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Illumina</rs> <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c51917cc77-software-1">GenomeStudio</rs> Software. In <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c51917cc77-software-simple-4">Nexus</rs>, systematic array correction files were used with the linear correction model to correct for GC bias, and a significance threshold of 1 3 10 27 was applied. The SNP-FAST2 Segmentation algorithm was used for analysis, with homozygous frequency threshold at 0.95, hemizygous loss threshold at 20.23, and single copy gain at 0.13 for the log R ratio. A total of 184 samples were processed on the arrays. Samples were removed from the project if they had 1 or more of the following: a ,95% call rate (0 samples), a probe-to-probe variability (quality) of .0.1 (15 samples), a sex mismatch (0 samples), and .100 CNVs (34 samples), leaving n 5 144. To avoid false-positives, only variants that contained .12 consecutive altered SNP probes and that were .20 kb in size were analyzed. CNVs showing .90% coverage of variants of a frequency of $0.1% of the same type, reported in the Database of Genomic Variants (http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home), using array comparative genomic hybridization or SNP arrays, were considered copy number polymorphisms and were excluded from further analysis (i.e., CNVs reported in this study are designated as "rare"). CNVs that did not overlap exons of a gene were also excluded. The potential for pathogenicity was based on gene content/disruption, CNV size, frequency, and previous association of genes or regions with epilepsy and related neurologic conditions. Gene products were annotated for Gene Ontology (GO) categories within biological processes and molecular functions using the Gene Ontology Consortium Web tool at http://geneontology.org/.</p>

            <p>When done correctly, the survival rates in mice (male: age 8-10 weeks, 22-28g; female: age 10-12 weeks, 20-26g) are: over 90% in acute ischemia/reperfusion and ischemic preconditioning experiments, over 85% in permanent artery ligation studies, and approximately 80% for intramyocardial injections. Since early injury is more readily visible by metabolic changes rather than structural, infarct size determination in ischemia/reperfusion and ischemic preconditioning experiments is performed by infusing 1% Evan's blue dye into the aorta which will perfuse the heart that is not supplied by the LAD <ref type="figure">(Figure 1A)</ref>. Once the heart is removed and transversely cut in half, the tissue is incubated in 1% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride to measure infarct size <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>. The areas are measured using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="d04430056f-software-simple-0">Scion</rs> or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="d04430056f-software-simple-1">NIH imaging</rs> software which can be calibrated using a micrometer imaged at the same magnification. These numbers are used to calculate area at risk/left ventricle and infarct size/area at risk <ref type="bibr">11</ref>. Strain differences can result in variations in body weight and heart size and so care should be taken to normalize these measures to heart weight, body weight, or tibia length for comparative purposes.</p>
            <p>Permanent artery ligation results in gross structural changes such as necrosis, wall thinning, and chamber dilation. Comparison of the effects of treatment and/or time on infarct size and necrosis relative to the left ventricle, chamber area, septal wall and left ventricular free wall thickness in the permanent occlusion model <ref type="figure">(Figure 2A)</ref> can also be measured using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="d04430056f-software-simple-2">Scion</rs> or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="d04430056f-software-simple-3">NIH imaging</rs> software. Collagen staining with picrosirius red/ fast green <ref type="figure">(Figure 2B)</ref> can be used to measure insterstitial fibrosis which correlates to functional indices of wall stiffening <ref type="bibr">8-10</ref>. The image in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> represents the distribution of 6ul solution (Evan's blue) injected into the border zone of the heart following permanent artery ligation.

            <p>Nucleosomes were assembled on 54A18 DNA fragments for RSC and SWI/SNF repositioning and 54A0 DNA fragments for Chd1 repositioning. Each 10 ml reaction contained 1 pmol of wild-type and mutant nucleosomes assembled on cy3 and cy5 labelled DNA, respectively, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP and the quantity of remodeller specified in figures. Samples were incubated in 0.2-ml thin walled PCR tubes (ABgene, UK) in an Eppendorf mastercycle with heated lid at 308C for the times specified in figures, before reaction termination by transferal to ice and addition of 500 ng of HindIII-digested bacteriophage lambda competitor DNA (Promega, USA) and 5% (w/v) sucrose. Samples were resolved on a native polyacrylamide gel [5% acrylamide:bis acrylamide (49:1 ratio), 0.2 Â TBE buffer (0.5 mM EDTA, 22.3 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.3), 0.1% APS and 0.1% TEMED]. Gels were cast horizontally between 20 by 20-cm glass plates using 1.5-mm Teflon spacers, before mounting vertically in the gel apparatus (Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) and pre-running at 300 V for 3 h with continuous pump recirculation of 0.2 Â TBE buffer between the upper and lower compartments at 48C. Gels were run at 300 V for 3.5 h and imaged using a Phosphoimager FLA-5100 (Fujifilm, Japan). Gel band intensities were quantitated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="b921a2b609-software-0">AIDA</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b921a2b609-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Raytest</rs>, Germany). The proportion of nucleosomes repositioned was calculated as the intensity of the sum of all detectable products over the sum of the major initial position plus products. In many assembly reactions a proportion of nucleosomes are assembled at a minor assembly location marked as the P position (e.g. Ã in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>A) <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Including this band in the calculations was found not to significantly affect the determination of initial rates. In some histone mutants the proportion of nucleosomes assembled at the P position was altered, and some additional less abundant sites of deposition were also observed. However, again inclusion nucleosomes assembled at these locations was not found to significantly affect the comparison of initial rates. As a result, in the analysis presented here nucleosomes deposited at locations other than the major NucA locations are not in included in quantitation. For some mutations a small proportion of nucleosomes were observed to undergo thermal repositioning in control reactions lacking remodelling enzyme. However, this was generally detected after long incubations and the proportion of nucleosomes repositioned at early time points was low enough not to affect the calculation of initial rates. The reproducibility of the assay when carried out in this manner was found to be high (Supplementry <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p>

            <p>The primary outcome for this study was the rate of emergency cesarean section, which we compared across the prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain categories. The secondary outcome was the risk of emergency cesarean section among the prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain categories. For an inter-group comparison of age, prepregnancy weight and BMI, gestational weight gain, gestational age at delivery and neonate birth weight, we used an independent t-test. For a comparison of parity, GDM, the incidence of LGA infants, each BMI status and each gestational weight gain status based on the 2009 IOM guidelines, a chi-square test was used. To evaluate the crude association between prepregnancy BMI or gestational weight gain and emergency cesarean section, logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also calculated the adjusted ORs after adjusting for potential confounding factors, including maternal age, parity, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, labor induction, LGA, fetal sex, and GDM. Additional regression models included prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain with the other confounders to evaluate the independent effect of prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain on the risk of emergency cesarean section. To further investigate the difference gestational weight gain-emergency cesarean section association stratified by maternal prepregnancy BMI, we calculated the adjusted ORs after adjusting for confounders with gestational weight gain in each prepregnancy BMI group. P-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

            <p>Profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been one of the most successful methods to date for recognizing both close and distant homologs of given protein sequences. Popular HMM methods such as <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-0">HMMER</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Eddy et al., 1998a, b)</ref> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-1">SAM</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Hughey and Krogh, 1996)</ref> have been behind the design of databases such as Pfam <ref type="bibr">(Finn et al., 2006)</ref>, PROSITE <ref type="bibr">(Hulo et al., 2006)</ref> and SUPERFAMIILY <ref type="bibr">(Wilson et al., 2007)</ref>. However, a limitation of these HMMs is, since there is only finite state information about the sequence that can be held in any particular position, HMMs cannot capture dependencies that are far, and variable distance apart, in sequence.</p>
            <p>While these conditional random field and Markov random field models are extremely powerful in theory, in practice, substantial computational barriers remain for template construction, training and computing the minimum energy threading of an unknown sequence onto a template. Thus, a general structure software tool designed for β-structural folds, in the same manner as <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-2">HMMER</rs> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-3">SAM</rs> packages recognize all protein structural folds, remains a challenging unsolved problem.</p>
            <p>In this article, we compare ordinary <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-4">HMMER</rs> Profile HMMs,<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-5">HMMER</rs> Profile HMMs augmented with a point mutation model (similar to <ref type="bibr">Kumar and Cowen, 2009)</ref>, and HMMs augmented with training sequences based on pairwise dependencies of β-sheet hydrogen bonding (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Thus we have generalized the single frequency approach of <ref type="bibr">Kumar and Cowen (2009)</ref>based on β-strand constrained evolution, the following pipeline is followed:</p>
            <p>For the single frequency augmented training model, we used the popular program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-8">MUSCLE</rs> Version<rs corresp="#ca543acf2c-software-8" resp="#annotator2" type="version">4</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Edgar, 2004)</ref> to generate the MSA that was provided to the HMM training methods. It is one of the fastest programs available and produces global sequence alignments for the set of sequences from a family. We developed a script to transform the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-8">MUSCLE</rs> alignment output to .ssi (STOCKHOLM) format since other <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-9">MUSCLE</rs> output formats are not supported by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-11">HMMER</rs> <rs corresp="#ca543acf2c-software-11" resp="#annotator2" type="version">3.0a2</rs>.</p>
            <p>β−Strands in the aligned set of structures are found by the program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-13">SmurfPreparse</rs> which is part of the Smurf Package <ref type="bibr">(Menke, 2009; Menke et al., 2010)</ref>. The program not only outputs the positions of the consensus β-strands in the alignment, it also declares a position buried or exposed based on which of the two tables is the best fit to the amino acids that appear in that position in the training data.</p>
            <p>Two packages are widely adopted to work width profile HMMs: <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-13">SAM</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Hughey and Krogh, 1996)</ref> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-16">HMMER</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Eddy, 1998a, b)</ref>. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-15">SAM</rs> has been demonstrated to be more sensitive overall, while <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-16">HMMER</rs>'s model scoring is more accurate <ref type="bibr">(Wistrand and Sonnhammer, 2004)</ref>. In this study we use<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-18">HMMER</rs> versions <rs corresp="#ca543acf2c-software-18" resp="#annotator2" type="version">3.0a2</rs> to evaluate the models of protein families as it is freely available and can be easily downloaded from the website. We construct HMMs from the MSAs using the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-19">hmmbuild</rs> program which is part of the<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-20">HMMER</rs> package.</p>
            <p>In this approach, the model of the HMM is made up of a linear set of match (M) states, one per consensus column in the MSA. Each M state emits a single residue, with a probability score that is determined by the frequency that residues have been observed in the corresponding column of the MSA. Each match state therefore carries a vector of 20 probabilities, for scoring the 20 amino acids. The HMMs also model the gapped alignments by including insertion (I) and deletion (D) states in between the match states. The match, insertion and deletion states are connected by the transition probabilities. In our experiment, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-21">HMMER</rs> is used as a black box except the constraints on choosing match states are made tighter. Using default settings, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-22">HMMER</rs> creates a match state whenever a column in the MSA has &lt;50% gaps. We found empirically in <ref type="bibr">Kumar and Cowen (2009)</ref> that the default cutoff was not optimal for our datasets because homology was too remote, and creating a column whenever there are &lt;20% gaps yielded the best HMMs on our datasets. Thus we duplicate this threshold in the current study.</p>
            <p>By default, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-23">HMMER</rs> uses a maximum a posteriori (MAP) architecture algorithm to find the model architecture with the highest posterior probability for the alignment data. The algorithm is guaranteed to find a model and i289 constructs the model by assuming that the MSA is correct and then marks columns that correspond to match states. An HMM is created for every MSA, thus there is a one to one correspondence between an MSA and an HMM, generating a library of HMMs. Therefore, for any sequence from the MSA, the HMM can be used to determine if it belongs to the MSA. In addition, the HMM can be used to check if a new sequence is similar to the sequences in the MSA and if it is then one can place the new protein in the same family. We used the default 'glocal' setting to construct the models which are global with respect to model and find multiple hit local with respect to sequence.</p>
            <p>In order to reduce the skewness in the distribution of sequences used to construct an HMM, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-24">HMMER</rs> supports several options to weight the sequences in training data. The default option GSC assigns lower weights to sequences that are over-represented <ref type="bibr">(Gerstein et al., 1994)</ref>. In addition,<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-25">HMMER</rs> supports external and internal sequence weighting strategies based on information theoretic principles. Based on our study of different sequence weighting options for HMMs with and without the point mutation augmented training for the task of learning SCOP superfamilies <ref type="bibr">(Kumar and Cowen, 2009</ref>) we used <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-26">SAM</rs> sequence entropy <ref type="bibr">(Karplus et al., 1998)</ref> throughout the present study.</p>
            <p>Once an HMM is build from an MSA, a new sequence can be scored by the HMM. The score (S) is the log of the probability of observing the sequence from a HMM divided by the probability of observing the same sequence from the 'null hypothesis' model or HMM. S = log 2 P(seq|HMM) P(seq|null) P(seq|HMM) is the probability of the target sequence according to a HMM and P(seq|null) is the probability of the target sequence given a 'null hypothesis' model of the statistics of random sequence. In <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-27">HMMER</rs>, this null model is a simple one-state HMM that says that random sequences are independently and identically distributed sequences with a specific residue composition. In addition, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-28">HMMER</rs> also generates an E-value which is the expected number of false positives with a score as high as the hit sequence. While the log odd scores (S) provides information on the quality of a hit, the E-value gives a measure relative to other sequences. Therefore a lower E-value implies that the sequence matches more closely to the HMM.</p>

We have developed a  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a4367c2269-software-simple-0">Python library</rs> with a set of application programming interfaces for building different GOrelated graphs and performing various queries <ref type="bibr">(Muller et al., 2009)</ref>. This library is based on the Python package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4367c2269-software-simple-1">NetworkX</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Hagberg et al., 2008)</ref>. In a graph representation of the GO, referred to as GOGraph, each node (vertex) represents a GO term and each directed edge corresponds to the IS_A relationship between a parent-child GO term pair. The directed edges between terms represent their semantic relationship such that the concept of a parent node subsumes those of its children nodes. Hence, the constructed GOGraph obeys the 'true path rule' or in other words the pathway from a child term to the most top-level parent is always true. Then, genes are added as another type of node to the GOGraph via an edge to its associated GO term(s) to create the GOGeneGraph. The GOGeneGraph is further modified by the addition of edges between terms that share the same gene annotations. Associating GO terms with the genes they annotate enables the calculation of semantic distance for edges from a GOGraph using the established methods, see Section 2.2 for details. After initialization of the edge distances, the graph is further transformed into a weighted, undirected graph, so that the functional coherence of list of GO terms can be reflected by connectivity and distances among the terms rather than the directionality. The algorithm for constructing a GOGeneGraph is detailed in Supplementary Algorithm 1.</p>

            <p>All MRI data was obtained on the cine images using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="b948af5e96-software-0">MASS</rs> software package (<rs corresp="#b948af5e96-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Medis</rs>, Leiden, The Netherlands). On all the short-axis cine slices, the endocardial and epicardial borders were outlined manually on the end-diastolic and -systolic images. We divided the short axis into 12 equiangular segments to measure the LV segmental function, and the LV volumes and LV ejection fractions (LVEF) were calculated. We assessed delayed enhancement images and infarct size as previously described <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. The total infarct size was calculated as the percentage of the LV mass, and transmural extent of infarction was calculated by dividing the hyper-enhanced area by the total area of the predefined segment (%). A transmurality score was calculated in each patient, which was expressed as the sum of segments with &gt; 75% infarcted myocardium as a percentage of the total number of segments scored. On the delayed enhancement images, the MO was defined as any region of hypo-enhancement within the hyper-enhanced infarcted area, and was included in the calculation of the total infarct size. The extent of MO was calculated in each patient, and measured percent by dividing number of MO segment by number of total segment. All MRI measurements of the LVEF and extent of MO and infarct size were reviewed by two independent blinded observers. The intra-class correlation coefficients for the intra-and inter-observer agreement for these parameters were all &gt; 0.9.Intracoronary pressure parameters measurement Intracoronary pressure parameters were measured in each patient after PCI using previously described principles <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>. With commercially available software (Radi Medical Systems, Uppslae, Sweden), the shaft of the pressure wire can act as a proximal thermistor, sensor near the tip of the wire simultaneously measured the pressure and temperature acting as a distal thermistor. Thermodilution technique was used to check the the transit time of room temperature when saline was injected down to coronary arteries <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>. 3 mL aliquots of room temperature saline was administered to the coronary artery, and the resting mean transit time (baseline mean transit time [bTmn]) was measured. Steady state of maximal hyperemia was induced by intravenous infusion of adenosine (140 µg/kg/min). Three additional 3 mL aliquots of room temperature saline was injected, and the hyperemic mean transit time (hTmn) was measured. The simultaneous measurements of mean aortic pressure (Pa, by guiding catheter) and mean distal coronary pressure (Pd, by pressure wire) were also obtained during the resting state and maximal hyperemic state. The CFR thermo was calculated, dividing the resting hTmn by the bTmn. The IMR was defined as the simultaneously measured distal coronary pressure divided by the inverse of the hTmn <ref type="bibr">(12, 13)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The values are reported as the mean ± SD or median (25th-75th percentiles) for continuous variables and as frequency for categorical variables. The correlations between the extent of MO and coronary physiologic parameters were calculated by using simple linear regression analysis to identify parameters which are independently associated with the extent of MO, being determined by cardiac MRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between coronary hemodynamic pressure parameters and the presence of MO. A P value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

            <p>SVM classifier Z-scored values of each physiological parameter were used for linear SVM classification. SVM is a supervised machine learning method for data classification that can be trained to find the best hyperplane that separates all data points in two userdefined classes and can subsequently be exploited to blindpredict the class to which a new observation belongs <ref type="bibr">(37-39)</ref>. We defined two classes: mutated (heterozygous and null) and wild-type (males and females) mice. By using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="a7b2fbe727-software-simple-0">Matlab</rs> function svmtrain, we trained the SVM with a subset of data consisting of 50% of the dataset and we than used the remaining 50% for testing, using the svmclassify function. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and D-prime (d 0 ) were then computed for the categorical classification in order to evaluate its performance. This procedure was repeated 200 times, each one with a randomly divided training and testing subsets. Values for accuracy, sensitivity (or true positive rate), specificity (or true negative rate) and d 0 were averaged across iterations. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were defined as (TP þ TN)/total, TP/P and TN/N, respectively, where TP: True positive, TN: True Negative, P: total positives, N: total negatives.

            <p>. A number of exotic fish species were introduced in Iranian freshwaters. These species encompass 18.7% from the 81% of the fish inhabiting in south part of the Caspian Sea. Hemiculter leucisculus (Saw belly) is one of these species with low economic value. This species might be accidentally transferred to this region with fertilized egg and or larvae of Chinese carp for aquaculture, the place and origin of this fish is Yunnan, south-west of China <ref type="bibr">(2-5)</ref>. None-indigenous fish may have undesirable effects on endemic fish species, including destruction of habitat and water quality, predation, aggressive behavior such as fin nipping, retardation of reproductive activity, food competition, and introduction of parasites and disease to the new environment. Levels of parasitism and parasite diversity were significantly greater in native fishes than in exotic species, and this may contribute to an enhanced demographic performance and competitive ability in invading exotics. Levels of parasitism and parasite diversity in native fishes were negatively related to habitat disturbance, in particular to a suite of factors that indicate increased human use of the river and surrounding environment <ref type="bibr">(6-11)</ref>. Native parasites infecting exotic fish will increase their bio-potential through a vast host range. The exotic fish may play as a reservoir role for maintenance of parasite <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>. The aims of this study were to survey the parasite fauna on Blicca bjeorkna, as a native fish, and Hemiculter leucisculus, as an exotic fish, and to compare the prevalence of parasitic infection in these two species. A Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed by the software package of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f00e3823-software-simple-0">SPSS</rs>. Data were subjected to the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant differences in prevalence and mean intensity of parasitism between exotic and endemic fish was detected by Chi square test when α= 0.05.</p>

            <p>Live Imaging-MDA-MB-435/GFP-CLCa cells were grown in a 35-mm glass-bottomed dish (Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, Japan) for 48 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with chemicals and imaged on the temperature-controlled stage top incubator (Tokai Hit Co., Shizuoka, Japan) of fluorescent microscopy IX81 (Olympus Corp.) with a ϫ60 oil, NA 1.35 objective at 37°C under 5% CO 2 . Temperature and CO 2 concentration were maintained with an INUG2A control unit (Tokai Hit Co.). <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-9">MetaMorph</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>, Downingtown, PA) was used to control image acquisition and manipulation. For time-lapse observation, images were recorded as described previously by Sakaushi et al. <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Conformational Sampling of AMF-26-Conformational analysis of AMF-26 was performed on an Apple Power Mac G5 (PowerPC G5, 2.5 GHz; two central processing units), using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-10">Conformational Analyzer with Molecular Dynamics and Sampling (CAMDAS)</rs> <rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-10" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.1</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. Ten molecular dynamic (MD) calculations were simultaneously performed using different initial structures. Each of the MD calculations was carried out for 1 ns with an integral time step of 1 fs. The lengths of the covalent bonds were fixed. The temperature of the system was maintained at 1,200 K to enhance the sampling efficiency. Conformers were sampled every 100 steps, and then each conformer was minimized until the root mean square of the gradients of the potential energy was below 0.001 kcal mol Ϫ1 Å Ϫ1 . All conformations were clustered with torsion angles of heavy atoms using a threshold of Ϯ30°. The Merck Molecular Force Field 94s was used to evaluate the potential energy surface of the molecule <ref type="bibr">(28, 29)</ref>. The dielectric constant was 80, but no cut-off distance for non-bonded interactions was used. Because of the low probability of the existence of conformers with higher energies, the conformers within 15 kcal mol Ϫ1 of the minimum energy of the molecule were adopted for superposition.</p>
            <p>Molecular Modeling of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 Domain Complex-To obtain the initial structure of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 domain complex, the sampled conformers of AMF-26 were superposed onto BFA in the X-ray structure of the Arf-BFA-Sec7 domain complex (PDB code 1r8q) (8) using the parallel version of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-4">SUPERPOSE</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(30)</ref>. This superposes two molecules based on the physicochemical properties of the atomic groups, which is useful for estimating the binding conformation of a molecule by distinguishing it from the many conformations that are generated by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-5">CAMDAS</rs>. The program considers five types of physicochemical property: hydrophobic (HP), aromatic (AR), hydrogen-bond donors (HD), hydrogenbond acceptors (HA), and hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (DA). Each type is represented as a sphere with a predefined radius (1.0 or 0.5 Å) and is assigned to a functional group in a molecule <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4, A and B)</ref>. After molecular superposition, the matching spheres were scored using the scoring matrix (supplemental <ref type="table">Table S1)</ref>. One AMF-26 conformation was chosen as the binding conformation based on the scores and the overlapped molecular volumes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4C)</ref>. The superposition calculations were performed using 28 nodes of a Dell PowerEdge 1950III (Intel Quad Core Xeon X5460; 3.16 GHz; 56 central processing units in total). The overlapped molecular volumes were calculated by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-11">SYBYL</rs> <rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-11" resp="#annotator2" type="version">7.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-11" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Tripos Inc</rs>., St. Louis, MO) on an Hewlett Packard work station xw8200 (Intel Xeon; 3.60 GHz; 2 central processing units).</p>
            <p>To relieve the steric hindrances, the coordinates of AMF-26 and of the residues within 4 Å from AMF-26 were optimized to reduce the root mean square of the gradients of potential energy below 0.05 kcal mol Ϫ1 Å Ϫ1 using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-9">SYBYL</rs>. The simplex minimization method before the conjugate-gradient minimization procedure was used. The Tripos force field was employed for the molecular energy calculation.

The cut-off distance for the non-bonded interactions was 8 Å. The distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4r was used.

The ff99 <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref> and gaff <ref type="bibr">(38)</ref> force fields were used for the proteins and AMF-26, respectively. The partial charges for AMF-26 were derived from the restraint electrostatic potential method (39) using an ab initio calculation at the HF/6 -31G* level using Gaussian 03 <ref type="bibr">(40)</ref>. The complex was solvated in a box of 34616 TIP3P (41) water molecules. Six K ϩ ions were added to neutralize the system. The system was minimized until the root mean square of the gradients of potential energy was below 0.005 kcal mol Ϫ1 Å Ϫ1 . The 3.5-ns MD simulation was carried out at constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (310 K), under periodic boundary conditions, and with particle-mesh Ewald treatment (42) of electrostatics. SHAKE <ref type="bibr">(43)</ref> was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen, and a time step of 1 fs was used. An 8-Å cutoff was used for the nonbonded interactions.</p>
            <p>Immunofluorescence Microscopy-After being cultured in a 24-well glass bottom plate for 48 h, cells were treated with chemicals for various periods of time (as indicated in the relevant figure). Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with cold 3.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) for 20 min, and then washed and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated in blocking buffer containing 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 min before overnight incubation at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. After being washed, cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies. Cells were then washed, stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes), and mounted with fluorescent Novel Golgi Inhibitor Shows Potent Antitumor Activity mounting medium (Dako). The immunostained cells were imaged using a fluorescent microscope IX81 (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with a ϫ100 oil, NA 1.40 objective or with a ϫ40, NA 0.95 objective, and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-18">MetaMorph</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-18" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>, Sunnyvale, CA).</p>
            <p>Comparison between the BFA and AMF-26 Complexes-To support this conclusion, we performed computer modeling/MD simulations.

            <p>All participants had demographic, BMI, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and glucometabolic (cholesterol, triglycerides, BSL, HbA1c, oGTT and IV GTT) data collected at baseline. In addition, the renal transplant recipients had renal specific and transplant specific data collected pretransplant and at 3 and 12 months posttransplantation. As outlined in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, all patients had baseline IV GTT and oGTT tests. Results for glucose and insulin from multiple time points enabled the calculation of glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, insulin secretion and disposition index. Each test was conducted on a different day and after an overnight fast. The renal transplant recipients had these tests conducted within 2 months of renal transplantation. This group also had an IV GTT and oGTT conducted at 3 and 12 months posttransplantation. IV GTT was also performed on day 7 posttransplantation. Any recipient who had been commenced on a hypoglycemic agent had that agent withheld for 72 hours before each test. The oGTT test was conducted by administering 75 g of oral glucose and drawing a venous sample from an intravenous cannula placed in the cubital fossa of the nonarteriovenous fistula arm at 0, 30, 60 and 120 minutes. The IV GTT test was conducted by administering 0.3 mg/kg intravenous glucose to a maximum dose of 25 g, diluted in normal saline to a maximum volume of 100 mL. Venous samples were drawn from an intravenous cannula placed in the cubital fossa of the non-arteriovenous fistula arm at −10, −1, +2, +4, +6, +8, +10, +12, +14, +19, +25, +40 minutes. It has previously been established that this dose of intravenous glucose elicits the maximal pancreatic response over this period <ref type="bibr">21</ref> and similar protocols have been successfully used. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Glucose metabolism was assessed by 2 different approaches. Firstly, a comprehensive descriptive analysis was aided by the area under the curve (AUC) of oGTT of each recipient at pretransplant, 3 and 12 months posttransplant. Secondly, an improved understanding of the pathophysiology was gained by assessing the first phase insulin release (FPIR), insulin resistance and β cell responsiveness. FPIR is an index of the β cell response to intravenous glucose (insulinogenic index) and was calculated using the IV GTT by FPIR = (AUC insulin t0-10 minutes)/(Glucose t0minutes − (Av(t-10 minutes and t-1 minutes)) as previously described. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Insulin resistance was determined using paired insulin and glucose results obtained from IV GTT, which were then applied to the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ed434f1b3b-software-0">homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2)</rs> calculator, available from <rs corresp="#ed434f1b3b-software-0" resp="#curator" type="url">https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/ download.php</rs>. This has previously been validated in ESKD patients. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Insulin sensitivity is the inverse of insulin resistance. The DI (IV) was calculated as the FPIR/insulin resistance. The DI (IV) is a measure of β cell responsiveness and has been shown in the general population to bepredictive of the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in those at clinically increased risk. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> Disposition index relates insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance in a hyperbolic relationship such that an increase an insulin resistance is associated with a compensatory increase in insulin secretion to maintain normoglycemia. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> At the time of transplantation, recipients received 20 mg basiliximab on days 0 and 4, 500 mg intravenous methylprednisolone on day 0 followed by 30 mg daily of oral prednisolone which was weaned after 3 weeks by 2.5 mg every 2 weeks to a target dose of 5 mg daily. All recipients received 1 g twice a day of mycophenolate mofetil and a CNI, however, the choice of agent was at the discretion of the treating transplant physician. For those who received cyclosporin, the starting dose was 4 mg/kg twice a day with a C2 target of 1200 for the first month, 800 to 1000 at 3 months and 400 to 600 at 12 months. For those who received tacrolimus, the starting dose was 0.075 mg/kg twice a day with a trough tacrolimus target of 8 to 10 for the first month and 5 to 8 at 3 months. All recipients received protocol cytomegalovirus and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis. Renal transplant biopsies were conducted as protocol at 3 months or as indicated by clinical criteria. Acute cellular rejection was treated with oral prednisolone 300, 200, and 100 mg over 3 consecutive days. To comprehensively assess immunosuppression burden weekly therapeutic drug levels for CNI agents were collected and the cumulative exposure determined by calculating the AUC.</p>
            <p>Data is represented as median and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Continuous variables between groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher exact test.

The phylogenetic analysis of KNU-3 was carried out by distance tree construction. The ITS1 sequence of KNU-3 was aligned with sequences of available P. menonorum strains and its nearest species through the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f65719e8e2-software-simple-6">BLAST</rs> sequence using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f65719e8e2-software-simple-7">MultAlin program</rs>, and a neighbor-joining tree was constructed from the aligned sequences. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate was grouped with a reference isolate of P. menonorum with 99% bootstrap value support <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>, and was distinct from other Penicillium spp., which were grouped in distinct clades. These results indicate that the isolate KNU-3 is closely related to P. menonorum. Based on morphological properties, sequence homology, and phylogenetic analysis, the isolate KNU-3 was thus identified as P. menonorum. PGP traits. P. menonorum KNU-3 was able to produce siderophores in the plate-based assay as evidenced by the formation of a yellow zone on the CAS agar medium plate <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1A)</ref>. While the fungal isolate produced a significant amount of IAA (9.7 mg/L), no ACC deaminase activity was detected. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, P-solubilization increased from day 2 to day 6 with a value ranging from 198 to 408 mg/L <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1B)</ref>.

            <p>Numerous microfungi were isolated in the present study to investigate the fungal community in Jeongseon, Gangwondo, Korea. Among these isolates, one Penicillium sp. showed definitive similarity matches with P. menonorum. In order to confirm the morphological results, molecular identification of the isolate was carried out based on ITS sequence analysis. The ITS sequence of the isolate was compared to the GenBank database sequences by using the NCBI-<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f65719e8e2-software-simple-8">BLAST</rs> search program, and it was found to be identical to the type strain NRRL: 50410 of P. menonorum S.W. Peterson sp. nov. In addition, the phylogenetic tree revealed that the isolate was grouped in a distinct clade together with P. menonorum with bootstrap support value of 100% <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. Morphological and molecular characteristics of the isolate were in agreement with the description by Peterson et al. <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. P. menonorum S.W. Peterson sp. nov. is a phenotypically and genotypically broadly circumscribed new species that was first isolated from garden soil in southern California by Peterson et al. <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, and P. menonorum isolation from Panax ginseng has been reported in China <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this study presents the first record of P. menonorum in Korea. Many microbial-based agricultural techniques have been developed to exploit potential mechanisms for the enhancement of crop production in different soils. Although members of the genus Penicillium are common opportunistic pathogens in the soil environment, some Penicillium strains associated with the different plant rhizospheres are able to solubilize inorganic insoluble P salts and promote plant growth in the soil. Thus, the growth-promoting capacity of P. menonorum KNU-3 was evaluated by assaying for IAA and siderophore production, ACC deaminase activity, and P solubilization. IAA secreted by microorganisms promotes root growth through a direct stimulatory effect on plant cell elongation or cell division <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>. In the present study, P. menonorum KNU-3 was positive for both IAA and siderophore production. Other researchers have made similar observations for the IAA production by Penicillium sp. <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. Siderophores are important metabolites released by the PGP microorganisms that directly alleviate irondeficiency by increasing the supply of iron to the plant and indirectly depriving fungal pathogens of iron <ref type="bibr">[30, 31]</ref>. Kang et al. <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref> reported that siderophores are also able to chelate Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , and Al 3+ from a soil solution. In this study, the isolate showed both IAA production and the presence of siderophores, which may provide an explanation for its PGP activity. Several studies have demonstrated that production of siderophores, other secondary metabolites, and lytic enzymes by Penicillium spp. were most effective in promoting plant growth and controlling plant root pathogens.</p>

            <p>The study was performed according to a randomized crossover design. After a run-in period of 4 weeks, during which patients were stabilized on their own diet, they followed, in alternate order, two isoenergetic diets, each for 4 weeks. One diet was relatively rich in carbohydrate, rich in dietary fiber both of soluble and insoluble type, and with a low glycemic index; the other was rich in MUFA, relatively low in carbohydrate, low in dietary fiber, and with a relatively high glycemic index <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The glycemic load of the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet was lower than that of the high-MUFA diet (155 vs. 205). The other components of the two diets, in particular, the saturated fat content, were similar <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Calories and nutrients of the diets were calculated from tables of food composition of the Italian Institute of Nutrition using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a5d2393b1f-software-1">MetaDieta</rs> software (<rs corresp="#a5d2393b1f-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Meteda s.r.l</rs>., AscoliPiceno, Italy). The main components of the two diets were as follows: 1) a portion of legumes four times a week, one serving of pasta twice a week, and one serving of parboiled rice once a week; two servings of vegetables and two fruits per day; and whole-grain bread for the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet and 2) white bread, a serving of potatoes, rice, or pasta each twice weekly; a serving of pizza once a week; and use of vegetables and fruits low in fiber for the low-carbohydrate diet (a weekly meal schedule for both dietary treatments is shown in an online appendix, Tables S1 and S2, available at http://care.diabetesjournals. org/cgi/content/full/dc09-0266/DC1).</p>
            <p>Because there was no carry-over effect, the results of patients starting with either diet were put together.

            <p>Cells were grown on glass coverslips to a density of 50-70% confluence, and coverslips were mounted in a chamber filled with DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Temperature was maintained at 37 ± 2ºC with an Air Stream Incubator (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Timelapse epifluorescence microscopy was carried out on an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63× 1.4 NA objective. Images were captured with a Micromax 782Y cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific) driven by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator11" type="software" xml:id="ed2bd766e9-software-simple-0">WinView32</rs> software or with a AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss) driven by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator11" type="software" xml:id="ed2bd766e9-software-1">AxioVizion</rs> <rs corresp="#ed2bd766e9-software-1" resp="#annotator11" type="version">4.6</rs> (Zeiss) software. The frames were collected every 4 s with an exposure time of 0.5-1.0 s. To minimize phototoxic damage, a 100 W halogen lamp was used as a light source for fluorescent imaging of live cells.</p>
            <p>Image analysis was performed as described earlier <ref type="bibr">(Minin et al., 2006)</ref> using an open source image analysis software, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator11" type="software" xml:id="ed2bd766e9-software-2">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#ed2bd766e9-software-2" resp="#annotator11" type="url">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</rs>). Because of the diverse morphology of mitochondria, we plotted the coordinates of one end for longer organelles and the center of mass for shorter ones. Mitochondrial motility was expressed in terms of the displacement distances and velocities. To define fast organelle movements, we applied a threshold of 200 nm/s. The values of the relative motility of mitochondria were expressed as mean percentages of fast movements in all recorded displacements ± SEM. In each experiment, 20-40 individual mitochondrial movements were analyzed in each of 10-15 cells. The significance of differences was estimated statistically by the paired-sample Student's t test. Variability of the values calculated for different cells in the samples was analyzed by the same method and was insignificant.</p>

Once acquired, each image was checked for quality and re-imaged if necessary. The images were saved as tagged image format files (TIFFs) as this format contains all of the original data. A permanent database was created of the original images.</p>
            <p>Each tooth section was placed on a blue rubber base to provide consistent background contrast when imaged, and a steel rule was placed on the base adjacent to the tooth section for calibrating the image.

Similarly, the most prominent point of the labial curve to the proximal line was obtained by drawing a tangent parallel to the proximal line using the length option (L3). The point at which the tangent was the greatest length from the labial curve was the most prominent point. The vertical distance between L2 and L3 along the proximal line was determined (L4). L4 was measured and was either negative or positive in value, according to the position of the most prominent point being incisal or gingival respectively to the mid-point <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Normally distributed quantitative variables are expressed as means and standard deviations. Nonparametric variables are expressed as median, minimum, and maximum values. Differences in the distribution of selected characteristics between patient groups were examined using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. The analysis was performed using Student's t-test for normally distributed continuous variables and the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests for nonparametric variables. Variables associated with wall location and events in univariate analysis (P , 0.10) were included in the multivariate analyses. Continuous variables were used as dichotomous variables to facilitate clinical interpretation and standardize the multivariate analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the area under the curve (AUC) or the c statistic; the cut-off point for BNP and other continuous variables with the best predictive value was used for wall location and cardiac events. A multiple logistic regression model was used for the selection of variables predictive of involvement of the anterior wall and for the occurrence of in-hospital events during index admission. Cox multivariate regression was used for the selection of independent prognostic factors of mortality and any follow-up events. Two-sided P values , 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="d05f513f8b-software-0">Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)</rs> software version <rs corresp="#d05f513f8b-software-0" resp="#annotator8" type="version">11.0</rs> for Windows. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients.

The median peak troponin I level was 6.9 ng/mL (range: 1 to 150), and the median peak CK-MB level was 19 ng/mL (range: 2 to 500). The echocardiogram LVEF was normal ($ 55%) in 55 patients (32%), and the median LVEF was 47%. No statistically significant differences were observed between LVEF values regarding involvement of the anterior and lateral/inferior walls.</p>

            <p>Previously, we have presented <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-0">QmRLFS-finder</rs>, a tool using an updated quantitative model of RLFS (QmRLFS) model that has predicted the RLFS locations in ∼75% of the human genes <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. This tool allowed a higher accuracy, precision and strand specificity of the QmRLFSbased predictions of the R-loops in the proximal promoter and downstream transcription termination site regions <ref type="bibr">(7,20)</ref>. Soon after the publication of the R-loopDB, the DNA:RNA immune-precipitation coupled to highthroughput sequencing (DRIP-seq) data became available <ref type="bibr">(9,23)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Ginno et al. (9)</ref> have improved the initial DRIP-seq method <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref> and reported detection of 4181 RNA:DNA hybrid regions. In <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>, we reported that RLFS predicted by<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-1">QmRLFS-finder</rs> overlapped with 79.2% of DRIP-seq regions defined by Ginno et al. <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. In a comparison of the frequencies of experimentally defined R-loops with those RLFSs predicted by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-2">QmRLFS-finder</rs>, our tool showed 91% accuracy, 94% sensitivity and 75% specificity <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The new version of R-loopDB, based on the predictions by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-3">QmRLFS-finder</rs> <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>, includes several key improvements and extensions that facilitate exploration of the RLFS analysis. We updated the identification of RLFSs in the human genome and provided for the first time the genome-scale prediction of RLFSs in seven additional organisms. The updated R-loopDB allows the user to search for gene(s) containing RLFSs not only in genic regions but also in 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking sequence of the gene, termed 'RLFS-positive genes'. Compared to the previous R-loopDB version, we now use <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-4">Ensembl gene annotation system</rs> that contains information on protein coding genes, pseudogenes, long noncoding RNA genes and short noncoding RNA genes <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. Mapping of RLFSs and other genomic regulatory sequences is graphically visualized in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-16">Gbrowse</rs> <rs corresp="#f93449ce3d-software-16" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2</rs> <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-7">UCSC genome browser</rs> <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. In the case of the human and mouse genomes, the experimentally detected RNA:DNA hybrid data <ref type="bibr">(9,12,14,24)</ref> on the genome scale were integrated into the genomics viewers. That allows users to carry out comprehensive comparative analyses of the predicted and experimentally detected RLFSs. Based on the provided results, users can narrow down their target and pick the most plausible sequence of the R-loop forming region.</p>
            <p>We collected all genome assembly data from the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-18">UCSC genome browser</rs> (<rs corresp="#f93449ce3d-software-18" resp="#curator" type="url">https://genome.ucsc.edu</rs>/) <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. The human genome hg19 (NCBI build GRCh37) was used as the reference genome in this database. We also analyzed genomic data of selected model organisms including Mus musculus (mm10), Rattus norvegicus (rn5), Pan troglodytes (panTro4), Gallus gallus (galGal4), Xenopus tropicalis (xenTro3), Drosophila melanogaster (dm5) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (saccer3). Only the reference chromosomes were used in this study. Therefore, we excluded other sequence regions such as unlocalized and unplaced scaffolds, supercontigs, assembly patches and alternate loci (haplotypes). Gene annotation data for these organisms was retrieved directly from <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-19">MySQL</rs> server of BioMart database build 75 (ensembl mart 75; <rs corresp="#f93449ce3d-software-19" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.ensembl.org/info/ data/mysql.html</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. Genomic information of the gene structures for these organisms (GTF format) was downloaded from <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-20">Ensembl</rs> Release <rs corresp="#f93449ce3d-software-20" resp="#annotator2" type="version">75</rs> (<rs corresp="#f93449ce3d-software-20" resp="#curator" type="url">http://feb2014.archive. ensembl.org/info/data/ftp</rs>/; accessed 1 April 2016).</p>
            <p>We predicted R-loop structures on both strands of genomic DNA using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-15">QmRLFS-finder</rs> <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. After obtaining RLFSs, we collected RLFSs located in the genic region and 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking regions of each gene using<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-16">BEDTools</rs> <ref type="bibr">(28)</ref>. RLFSs that overlapped by at least one nucleotide were merged into unique RLFS clusters. When no further RLFSs overlapped the long merged sequence, then this sequence, called an RLFS-merged region, has reached its maximum length. Such regions were reported, counted and made visible in the updated R-loopDB.</p>
            <p>R-loopDB currently covers eight organisms, including human, mouse, rat, chimpanzee, chicken, frog, fruit fly and yeast. Supplementary Table S1 provides information on the genome assemblies of these species. Using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-17">QmRLFS- finder</rs> <ref type="formula">(22)</ref>, we significantly extended the list of RLFSs and RLFS-positive genes in the human genome compared to the previous version <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. The summary statistics of RLFSs, RLFS-merged regions and RLFS-positive genes presented in the previous and updated R-loopDBs are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. For instance, 511 651 RLFSs (or 169 222 RLFSmerged regions) were computationally predicted in genic regions and 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking regions of the genes, whereas, in the previous R-loopDB, 245 181 RLFSs (or 140 106 RLFS-merged regions) were found in the UCSC-defined gene regions. In total, R-loopDB provides chromosome coordinates, sequences and genomic data of 1565 795 RLFSs distributed across 121 056 genes and 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking region of the genes of eight organisms.</p>
            <p>Using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-18">Ensembl</rs> gene annotation system <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref> in RloopDB, RLFS-positive genes can be classified into 93 454 protein-coding genes, 7 554 pseudogenes, 12 480 long noncoding RNA genes and 7 568 short non-coding RNA genes <ref type="table">Table 2)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Visual tools for RLFS search could be used for locating putative R-loops in a specific region of genic or gene-proximal regions for further experimental design and validation of the computational prediction(s). Here, we redesigned the interface of R-loopDB to search genes containing RLFS in multiple organisms with a single search. The genes containing RLFS can be retrieved from the database using several search options, e.g. keywords, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-19">Ensembl</rs> gene ID or <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-20">Ensembl</rs> transcript ID, gene symbol, gene description, Entrez ID, Refseq ID, gene biotype and synonyms <ref type="figure">(Figure 1A)</ref>. Note that the keywords option will search the query input string against all terms in the database. The gene search query returns RLFS-positive genes <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>of the particular gene. Each RLFS-merged region has useful information for supporting the R-loop forming potential, such as (i) the number of RLFSs, and (ii) strand and (iii) statistics of the GC skew value. To find RLFS candidates for experimental validation, we recommend that users consider the information in the RLFS-merged region table <ref type="figure">(Figure 1C.ii)</ref>. The first one is the 'number of RLFSs'. A higher number of RLFSs in the RLFS-merged region implies a higher propensity of R-loop initiation and formation in a given locus. The second one is 'strand'. According to the R-loop definition where a nascent RNA is hybridized with a DNA template, predicted RLFS are located on the same strand as the transcribed gene <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S1)</ref>. The third one is 'statistics of GC skew value'. GC skew value was calculated at the whole genomic scale, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>c. The 'statistics of GC skew value' show statistics of GC skew value in each RLFS-merged region including minimum, maximum, mean and median. GC skew maximum values &gt; 0.1 (for plus strand) or GC skew minimum values &lt; −0.1 (for minus strand) are considered Grich regions <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>. The more G-rich an RLFS-merged region is, the more likely it is to increase the thermodynamic stability of R-loop formation <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>. In the case of the human and mouse genomes, 'DRIP/RDIP support' and 'DRIPc support' columns, which indicate the number of RNA:DNA hybrid detection experiments for each RLFS-merged region, are provided. There are at least nine RNA:DNA hybrid detection experiments including four DRIP-seq studies in Ntera2, one DRIP-seq in K562, one DRIP-seq in primary fibroblast cells <ref type="bibr">(9,12,14)</ref>, two RDIP-seq studies in IMR-90 and HEK293T cells <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref> and one DRIPc-seq in Ntera2. Individually, these experiments showed variations in the sequence overlap region boundaries, their locations and the sequence cluster overlap peak heights, however, collectively they often demonstrate the patterns converged on the theoretical predictions. A combination of computational predictions and biological data sets suggests a role of NEAT1-associated R-loops in an aberrant NEAT1 transcription initiation and/or 3-end elongation isoform syntheses, leading to modulation of the paraspeckle formation and cell malignancy.</p>
            <p>The top panel of the 'Genomic Location' result shows gene name, gene location, strand and cytoband information of the particular gene (see in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). New genomics visualization has been integrated into R-loopDB using embedded <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-21">Gbrowse2</rs>. The genomics viewer provides visualization of RLFS-merged, RLFS, CpG Island, GC skew profile, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-22">Ensembl</rs> genes, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-23">Ensembl</rs> transcripts, DRIP-seq profile, RDIPseq profile and DRIPc-seq profile in a particular genic region as well as in 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking regions of the gene. In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> Remark: the initial release database provides RLFSs only in genic regions, where the updated database provides RLFSs in genic regions and 2 kb up/downstream region of genes.</p>
            <p>The updated R-loopDB could be utilized not only as a predictive model resource but also as an analytical tool to predict and validate many RLFS-positive genes (as coding and non-coding for proteins), pseudogenes to test the specific hypotheses in R-loop biology, to improve the existing methods, to design new experimental studies and to provide an adequate interpretation of the experimental and theoretical results. In those contexts, a combination of R-loopDB and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f93449ce3d-software-simple-24">QmRLFS-finder</rs> web server (identifying RLFSs in nonannotated and artificial targeting sequences) might be useful.</p>

            <p>HPV detection. Fresh tumour samples were obtained by biopsy and immediately stored as RNA at À 80 1C until tested. Each sample was used for DNA and RNA detection. Nucleic acids' <ref type="bibr">18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 58, 59</ref> and 68) and low-risk (LR) HPV (types 6, 11, 42, 43 and 44), but does not allow the identification of specific genotypes. As for RNA, samples were analysed for HPV E6 and E7 mRNA by NucliSENS EasyQ HPV v.1 test (BioMérieux, Rome, Italy), based on the NASBA technique. It specifically detects the E6/E7 mRNA of five HR HPV types (HPV16/18/31/33/45); the other HR and LR genotypes are not detectable with this assay. Briefly, three premixes were made by the reconstitution of reagent spheres in the reagent diluent, followed by the addition of primer/molecular beacon mixes (either U1A/HPV16, HPV18/31 or HPV33/45).

            <p>Methods for interpretation of the LV and RV measures have been previously reported. <ref type="bibr">[15,16]</ref> Briefly, RV image analysis was performed by two independent analysts on <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dbac1a3eee-software-simple-0">Windows</rs> workstations using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dbac1a3eee-software-0">QMASS</rs> software (v<rs corresp="#dbac1a3eee-software-0" resp="#annotator13" type="version">4.2</rs>,<rs corresp="#dbac1a3eee-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Medis</rs>, The Netherlands). The endocardial and epicardial borders of the RV were traced manually on short-axis cine images at end-diastole and end-systole. Papillary muscles and trabeculae were included in the RV volumes and excluded from RV mass. <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> RVEDV and RVESV were calculated using Simpson's rule by summation of areas on each slice multiplied by the sum of slice thickness and image gap. RV mass was determined at end-diastole as the difference between end-diastolic epicardial and endocardial volumes multiplied by the specific gravity of the heart (1.05 g/cm <ref type="bibr">3</ref>). <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> RVSV was calculated by subtracting RVESV from RVEDV. RVEF was calculated by dividing RVSV by RVEDV. The intra-reader intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) from random, blinded re-reads of 229 scans for RV mass was 0.94 and for 230 scans was 0.99, 0.95, and 0.89 for RVEDV, RVESV, and RVEF, respectively. The intra-reader ICC was 0.96 for RVSV. The inter-reader ICCs from random, blinded re-reads of 240 scans for RV mass, RVEDV, RVESV, and RVEF were 0.89, 0.96, 0.94, and 0.80, respectively. The inter-reader ICC for RVSV was 0.93.</p>

            <p>This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, prospective phase II study. The primary objective of the study was to compare PFS associated with the use of IP and EP for the treatment of patients with previously untreated ES-SCLC. Secondary objectives were to compare the antitumor efficacy as assessed by ORR and OS, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of each regimen. All calculations and statistical analyses were conducted using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ebc484e58f-software-0">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#ebc484e58f-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">17.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#ebc484e58f-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). Comparisons of analyzed parameters between groups were performed with the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for proportional variables. Survival data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable analysis of the associations between diarrhea and UGT1A1 genotype in the IP arm were assessed with logistic regression.

            <p>Male mice with global glucagon receptor knockout and wild-type mice <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref> were provided by M.J.C. They were housed in individual cages with constant temperature and 12 h of light alternating with 12 h of darkness and fed Teklad 6% mouse/rat diet (Teklad, Madison, WI) with free access to water. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the North Texas Veterans Administration Medical Center. Chemical destruction of b-cells. b-cells were destroyed in 10-to 12-week-old Gcgr 2/2 and Gcgr +/+ mice with two intravenous injections of STZ (100 mg/kg body weight followed in 7 days by 80 mg/kg). Food intake, body weight, and blood glucose were measured weekly for 6 weeks. Plasma measurements. Blood glucose levels were measured with a glucose meter (Bayer Healthcare, Mishawka, IN). Plasma glucagon levels were measured using a Linco glucagon RIA kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Plasma insulin levels were measured using a rat/mouse insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL), and IGF-1 levels were measured using an IGF-1 ELISA kit (Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd., Boldon, UK). Free fatty acids (FFAs) were measured with a nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) kit (Waco Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Oral glucose tolerance test. After a 16 h fast, glucose (2 g/kg) was administered by gavage to the Gcgr mice. Blood was taken at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min intervals, and the blood glucose and plasma insulin were analyzed. Immunoblotting. Livers were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (0.15mM NaCl/0.05mM TrisHCl, pH,7.2/1% Triton-X100/1% sodium deoxycholate/0.1% SDS) with 10 mg/mL leupeptin and 10 mg/mL aprotinin. Proteins were resolved by sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/ PAGE) and transferred to a membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The blotted membrane was blocked in 1 3 Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with primary antibodies to cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB) and phospho-CREB (P-CREB) (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) or anti-g-tubulin at 4°C overnight, the membrane was washed with TBST buffer. Membranes were incubated with goat antirabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG for 1 h. The proteins were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare). Real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the liver by Trizol isolation method (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). All PCR reactions were performed in triplicate as previously described <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. The mRNA level was calculated by using standard curve method. Primer sequences are shown in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 1</ref>. Amino acid analysis of livers. Amino acids were analyzed in liver homogenates by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). All MS analyses used stable-isotope dilution with internal standards from Isotec, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, and CDN Isotopes. Immunohistochemistry and b-cell mass measurement. The distal 20% of pancreata dissected from adult mice were fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and dehydrated prior to paraffin embedding. Five micrometer contiguous paraffin sections were prepared on a Leica RM2155 rotary microtome for insulin and glucagon immunohistochemical staining, as previously described <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>.

            <p>EMSA autoradiographs were scanned with a Microtek Bio-5000 scanner, and binding equilibrium association constants (K A s) were determined with the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e20f4deb1b-software-simple-0">Densitometric Image Analysis</rs> Software, for which a description will be published elsewhere. To enable comparison of K A s measured at different times, relative K A s were determined by normalization with the K A for binding to the consensus sequence fragment, measured each time in parallel. In-gel footprinting of separated LysM-DNA complexes with the 1,10-phenanthroline-copper [(OP) 2 -Cu + ] ion (Cu-OP) was performed as described <ref type="bibr">(28)</ref>. Missing contact and premethylation binding interference experiments were performed as described previously <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>, using LrpB binding buffer to perform binding reactions. Reference ladders were generated by chemical sequencing methods <ref type="bibr">(30)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Micro-array data analysis was performed using an extended version of the programme described by <ref type="bibr">(36)</ref>, which uses the Ringo package of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="e20f4deb1b-software-simple-1">R-Bioconductor</rs> <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref>.The source code of the extended programme is made available through http://micr.vub.ac.be. It includes importing data, data quality assessment, pre-processing of data, identifying ChIP-enriched regions (chers) and determining significant differences between experiments with and without lysine. To avoid detection of peaks in the log 2 ratios due to reduced signal-to-noise ratios at lowintensity probes, as part of the pre-processing step, average log 2 intensities over red and green channels are calculated for each probe, and probes with resulting values smaller than the average minus twice the standard deviation are replaced by missing values. Next, a standard normalization step is performed in which Tukey's biweight mean across each sample's log 2 ratios is subtracted from individual log 2 ratios, and resulting values are averaged over replicates and smoothed over a 100-bp window to reduce stochastic noise and systematic noise due to differences in hybridization efficiency of different probes.</p>

            <p>Isolation and culture of primary CD8 + T cells. CD8 + T cells from 4 -8-wk-old Tcra Ϫ / Ϫ × P14 TCR transgenic (Taconic), C57BL/6J WT, or Tbx21 Ϫ / Ϫ (The Jackson Laboratory) mice were purifi ed ( &gt; 95% purity) by negative selection (Invitrogen) from pooled spleen and lymph node cells. CD8 + T cells from Runx3 Ϫ / Ϫ mice on the ICR background were purifi ed by positive selection (Miltenyi Biotec). All mice were maintained in specifi c pathogen-free barrier facilities and used according to protocols approved by the Immune Disease Institute and the Harvard Medical School Animal Care and Use Committees. For stimulation, purifi ed CD8 + T cells were cultured at 10 6 cells/ml (10 ml) in T25 fl asks coated with 1 μ g/ml each of anti-CD3 (clone 2C11) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51) by pretreatment with 300 μ g/ml goat anti -hamster IgG. After 48 h, cells were removed from the TCR stimulation and recultured at a concentration of 5 × 10 5 cells/ml in media supplemented with 100 U/ml rhIL-2. Every 24 h, viable cells were counted and readjusted to 5 × 10 5 cells/ml with fresh media containing the corresponding amount of rhIL-2. <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1) ( 12, 13 )</ref>. We therefore further fractionated the positively selected CD8 + T cells from Runx3 KO mice into CD8 + CD4 Ϫ SP or CD8 + CD4 + DP cells by separation using anti-CD4 magnetic beads. This yielded a Runx3 KO SP " enriched " population that contained 75% CD8 + CD4 Ϫ cells and a KO DP enriched population that contained 85% CD8 + CD4 + cells <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1)</ref>. The cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 for 2 d before removing them from the TCR stimulus and culturing them in media containing 100 U/ml IL-2. As previously reported, TCR-induced proliferation of Runx3 Ϫ / Ϫ CD8 + T cells was severely impaired, irrespective of CD4 expression <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1) ( 12, 13 )</ref>. However, the Runx3 Ϫ / Ϫ cells showed cell-surface expression patterns indicative of activated cells, including up-regulation of CD25 and CD69 <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1)</ref>. As expected from their ability to up-regulate CD25, Runx3 Ϫ / Ϫ CD8 + T cells responded to IL-2 supplementation after day 2 and effi ciently expanded until day 6 of the culture period, albeit at slower rates compared with WT cells <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1)</ref>. Although a fraction of the KO DP cells silenced CD4 expression after activation, the ratio of SP/DP cells in each enriched population remained constant thereafter, and we did not observe any major diff erences between these two populations throughout the culture period, indicating that in terms of eff ector CTL diff erentiation and under our culture conditions, Runx3 Ϫ / Ϫ CD8 + T cells that also coexpress CD4 are indistinguishable from those that do not. The data presented in <ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref> FACS-based cytotoxicity assay. To measure cytotoxicity, EL4 thymoma target cells were loaded with 0 or 1 μ M Gp33 peptide for 2 h before a 2-h coincubation with P14 CD8 + T cells at the eff ector-to-target ratios indicated in the fi gures in 96-well round-bottom plates. After the coincubation period, cells were stained with Annexin V -FITC and anti-CD8 -allophycocyanin. Data analysis was performed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="ef09459b66-software-0">FlowJo</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ef09459b66-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Tree Star, Inc</rs>.); EL4 target cells (CD8-negative events) were gated, and the percentage of Annexin V + target cells was determined.</p>

            <p>The lateral resolution of the probe is 1-2 mm depending on target depth, while the axial resolution is limited by the system's ultrasound bandwidth and is &lt; 0.2 mm. The probe displacement was performed manually, however the peak amplitudes weremeasured and displayed automatically by the system itself. After the blast, new peaks appeared indicating to formation of new areas with blood. The acoustic signal is amplified by a low-noise 40 dB second-stage amplifier and recorded by a high-speed digitizer (NI USB-5132, National Instruments, Austin, TX) at 8 bits resolution and 50 MS/s. The operator interface is a laptop (Dell Precision M4500) running <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b415d3336d-software-simple-0">Windows 7</rs> and custom <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="b415d3336d-software-simple-1">LabVIEW</rs> software. The software controls the OPO and analyzes signals in real time to allow for unattended monitoring once the probe is secured.</p>
            <p>The rat model is the most commonly used model in the TBI research due to the similarities between TBI in humans and rats and knowledge obtained in numerous rat TBI studies. To demonstrate the feasibility of the blast-induced hematoma formation monitoring with this technique, the rat model was best because the blast-induced TBI has been studied in rats by many groups. Blast-induced TBI in large animals is less reproducible and practical and is not well established yet. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the UTMB. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 15, weight = 370-520 g) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in an induction chamber, intubated and mechanically ventilated with a mixture of 70:30 air:oxygen and 1.5-3% isoflurane (2-3% during surgery, 1.5-2% during monitoring). A tail artery was cannulated for continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure via a Biopac MP-100 system (Biopac Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). The instantaneous blood pressure (with a sampling interval of 50 ms) was acquired, displayed and logged by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="b415d3336d-software-2">AcqKnowledge</rs> <rs corresp="#b415d3336d-software-2" resp="#annotator1" type="version">3.9</rs> software running on a Macintosh PC.

Body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe. The dorsal surface of the head was shaved, and any remaining hair removed with Nair lotion, to minimize the attenuation of the blast wave, the laser pulses, and the acoustic signals during oxygenation monitoring.</p>

The outcome variables were the dispensing cost, willingness to pay, and amount willing to pay for the community pharmacists' dispensing service. Cost was only analysed descriptively. The participant's knowledge of pharmacist dispensing was calculated as the percentage of the activities that the customer selected from the list of activities outlined in Section B. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used to assess the factors associated with the participants' WTP. The Mann-Whitney U, KruskalWallis, and Spearman correlation tests were used to assess the factors associated with the amount the participants' were willing to pay for the pharmacists' dispensing service. For all statistical tests performed, the significance level was set a priori at P&lt;0.05. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Description of the nature and benefit of the pharmacists' dispensing service. Assume that you are taking your prescription to a pharmacy for filling. At first, the pharmacist will screen your prescription to identify any potential medication errors, including incorrect medicine usage or possibility of the medicine in the prescription interacting with your condition or other medicine you are taking. Research has found that three out of ten prescriptions have medication errors. It is important to identify and solve these problems because they will lead to adverse reactions, such as rash, diarrhoea or reduced effectiveness of the medicine. Other research by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that there is at least one death per day and 1.3 million people are injured each year due to medication errors, including wrong medicine and improper dose. Here, the role of the pharmacist is to assist you in the prevention of the undesired outcomes by correcting any medication errors through professional screening, counselling and evaluation. The Jonna Briggs Institute in Australia has found that community pharmacists can reduce the risk of medication errors by 20%.</p>

In all tests, the significance level was set at 0.05.According to <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, the mean score of job stress was calculated to be 181.27 AE 24.17 indicating "moderate-high" level of stress. One-way ANOVA, independent t test and Pearson coefficient statistical procedures did not show any significant relationship between the mean job stress score and demographic characteristics of the participants. Additionally, the statistical analyses revealed no significant relationship between the mean scores of job stress and job satisfaction (p ¼ 0.152) and productivity.</p>

            <p>This dataset covers a variety of molecules with various levels of inhibitory activities against PDE-4. <ref type="figure">Fig. (1)</ref> shows the activity distribution of the 35 indole derivatives. To develop and rigorously validate a QSAR model, 28 molecules were selected as the training set, and the remaining 7 molecules were held out as the test set. The specific selection of the training and test sets was determined by either randomly splitting or clustering-based splitting of the original dataset.The 3D conformations of all the inhibitors were generated using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="add3ab4cec-software-0">OMEGA</rs> <rs corresp="#add3ab4cec-software-0" resp="#annotator8" type="version">2.0</rs> program available from <rs corresp="#add3ab4cec-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">OpenEye Scientific</rs> (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="add3ab4cec-software-1">OMEGA</rs> <rs corresp="#add3ab4cec-software-1" resp="#annotator8" type="version">2.0</rs>, <rs corresp="#add3ab4cec-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">OE Scientific</rs>, NM, USA). In this study, only the best conformer of each molecule was used to generate the pharmacophore points.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="add3ab4cec-software-simple-6">LigandScout</rs> program <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> was first employed to derive structure-based pharmacophore centers <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3a)</ref>. The advanced 3D pharmacophore model option of the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="add3ab4cec-software-simple-7">LigandScout</rs> program was used, which allows multiple pharmacophore feature types on the same heavy atom. The pharmacophore feature types used in this study include hydrogen bond donor (D), hydrogen bond acceptor (A), positively charged (P), negatively charged (N), and lipophilic (L) centers. Pharmacophore feature pairs are then generated by making all possible pair-wise combinations of the above pharmacophore centers. A specific pharmacophore feature pair is determined by both the feature types involved and the distance between the two centers. For example, AL in <ref type="figure">Fig. (3a)</ref> indicates a hydrogen bond acceptor (A) and lipophilic (L) feature pair; and the distance between them is 4.5 . Another example, AP, means a hydrogen bond acceptor (A) and a positive (P) feature pair and their inter-feature distance is 3 <ref type="bibr">8</ref>. All possible feature pairs are generated, and this recorded information reflects the pharmacophoric characteristics of the target binding site, and will be used as the reference for generating the SB-PPK descriptors of the inhibitor molecules. To avoid confusion with traditional pharmacophore fingerprints, we note that we do not need "distance binning" to capture different possible distance ranges because the pharmacophore features pairs are derived from the 3D structure of the target protein. Thus, all the feature pairs have defined distances.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="add3ab4cec-software-simple-8">LigandScout</rs> <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> is used to perceive the pharmacophoric groups on small organic molecules <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3b)</ref>. All pair-wise combinations of the perceived pharmacophore centers are checked for the feature types and interfeature distances. In the example given in <ref type="figure">Fig. (3b)</ref>, there is an AL pair and an AP pair, and the inter-feature distances for each pair are 4.6 A and 3.8 A, respectively.</p>
            <p>The relationship between the molecular descriptors and the biological activities is modeled by the PLS (Partial Least Square) method <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. Specifically, the PLS implementation in the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="add3ab4cec-software-3">MOE</rs> package (<rs corresp="#add3ab4cec-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Chemical Computing Group</rs>, Montreal, Canada) was used in this study. Other types of machine learning methods can be used as well to analyze the dataset.</p>
            <p>As described before (Cf. Method), <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="add3ab4cec-software-simple-11">LigandScout</rs> was used to analyze the interactions between PDE-4 inhibitors and the binding site of PDE-4, based on the X-ray structure of the inhibitor-bound PDE-4 (1xon.pdb). This analysis has revealed nine pharmacophore centers. The 3D rendering and the 2D depiction of the interactions are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. (5a)</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. (5b)</ref>, respectively. The following occupies the four hydrophobic centers: the cyclopentane ring, two chlorine atoms on the pyridine ring, and the central benzene ring. The cyclopentane ring interacts with hydrophobic residues in the PDE-4 binding pocket: MET337, MET357, PHE340, PHE372, and ILE336. Chlorines on the pyridine ring interact with hydrophobic residues MET273, PHE340, ILE336, and LEU319, and the central benzene ring interacts with ILE336, PHE372 and TYR159. The amide nitrogen occupies a hydrogen bond donor center, which interacts with a water molecule that serves as a bridge to the enzyme's binding pocket. Four hydrogen bond acceptor centers are identified and they are occupied by the following atoms/groups: the methoxy oxygen on the benzene ring, amide oxygen, pyridine nitrogen, and the ether oxygen (connecting the benzene and the cyclopentane rings). The methoxy oxygen and the ether oxygen atoms both interact with GLN369. The amide oxygen and the pyridine nitrogen interact with the small molecule EDO744 and a water molecule, respectively.</p>
            <p>To obtain predictive QSAR models, we systematically performed PLS analysis with different number of principle components used in the regression model. <ref type="figure">Fig. (7)</ref> shows how the number of principle components affects the quality a b <ref type="figure">Fig. (5)</ref>. a. 3D rendering of the pharmacophore features derived from Ligand-bound PDE4 structure using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="add3ab4cec-software-simple-12">LigandScout</rs> program. b. 2D depiction of the pharmacophore features perceived from the Ligand-bound PDE4 structure using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="add3ab4cec-software-simple-13">LigandScout</rs> program.where "A" and "D" represent hydrogen bond acceptor and donor features, respectively. b The numbers are the inter-feature distances between the corresponding feature pairs. For example, the distance between "A" and "A" in AA1 is 6.34 (A).of the resulting models for the best partitioning of training and test sets. The conventional correlation coefficient r 2 obtained for the training set monotonically increases while the predictive R 2 obtained for the testing set reaches a plateau before it starts to decrease. When the number of principle components (PC) is less than 3, the resulting QSAR models are not predictive for either the training set or the test set. When the number of principle components is over 8, the predictive ability for the test set starts to go down. This indicates potential over-training at higher number of principle components. According to our model validation protocol <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>, the models with the number of principle components between 5 and 8 are predictive for both the training and the test sets. The best models should be a trade-off between conventional r 2 and the predictive R 2 . Also, to compare with other literature work which uses number of principle components of 6 <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, we decided to use 6 components to build the final best models. <ref type="figure">Fig. (7)</ref>. Quality of the QSAR models depends on the number of principle components (PC) employed.</p>

            <p>In order to retain sufficient number of cases to support the subgroup analysis, which includes surgeons' perceptions in a nested model, all variables with non-significant coefficients were removed from the final main model. In addition one health measure was selected and retained as representative of the remaining health measures. Both the main and nested models were tested for goodness of fit <ref type="bibr">(Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow)</ref> and discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve). Data were analysed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c623bace38-software-0">STATA</rs> version <rs corresp="#c623bace38-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">12</rs>.</p>
            <p>All of the self reported measures of health demonstrate significantly worsening health with increasing age <ref type="table">(Table 5)</ref>. Participants aged X85years were more likely to have difficultly or need help with ADL (Po0.001) with over 50% of this age group, also having a ECOG performance status of 2 or more, compared with 21-37% of younger women (Po0.001). The proportion experiencing mild to moderate cognitive problems according to the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c623bace38-software-simple-2">6CIT</rs> screening tool was over twice as large among women aged X85 years (30.1%) compared with younger age groups (p14%) (Po0.001). Body mass index reduced with age (Po0.001) and a greater proportion of those aged over 80 years were non-smokers compared with younger women (P ¼ 0.008). There was over a 10% increase in the proportion scoring 1 or more on the Charlson co-morbidity index: from 41.1% of 70-74-year-olds to 52.9% of X85-year-olds (P ¼ 0.016). All measures of health were significantly associated with receipt of surgery <ref type="table">(Table 5)</ref>, with poorer health decreasing the likelihood of undergoing surgery. Over two thirds of those not undergoing surgery had a co-morbidity score of 1 or more compared with 44.0% of surgical patients. Those not receiving surgery were also more likely to need help with ADL (Po0.001) with 63.4% of these non-surgical patients having a ECOG performance status score of 2 or more compared with 26.4% of women having surgery (Po0.001). Non-surgical patients also had a slightly lower body mass index (P ¼ 0.006) and were more likely to smoke (P ¼ 0.007).</p>

            <p>To visualize native GFP or mRFP, we collected adult flies 4-6 days after eclosion and brains were dissected in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS (1.86 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 8.41 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 175 mM NaCl) and fixed for an additional 60 min at room temperature. Samples were then washed 3 3 10 min with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBT) and 2 3 10 min in PBS before mounting in Vectashield (Vector Labs). Imaging was performed on Leica TCS SP5 X. The resolution of the image stack was 1,024 3 1,024 with 0.5 mm step size and a frame average of 4.

The immunostaining against tyrosine hydroxylase and GFP was performed as described previously in <ref type="bibr">Burke et al. (2012)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Objective Microscope (Sutter) with a Zeiss 203, 1.0 NA W-Plan-Apochromat objective. Emitted photons were separated from excitation light by a series of dichromatic mirrors and dielectric and colored glass filters and detected by GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu Photonics H10770PA-40 SEL). Photomultiplier currents were amplified (Laser Components HCA-4M-500K-C) and passed through a custom-designed integrator circuit to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The microscope was controlled through MPScope 2.0 <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen et al., 2006)</ref> via a PCI-6110 DAQ board (National Instruments). Odor stimuli were delivered by switching mass-flow-controlled carrier and stimulus streams (CMOSense Performance Line, Sensirion) via software-controlled solenoid valves (The Lee Company). Flow rates at the exit port of the odor tube were 0.5 l/min. Images were converted to Analyze format and motion corrected by maximizing the pixel-by-pixel correlation between each frame and a reference frame. DF/F traces were calculated in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ec12e9705e-software-simple-5">ImageJ</rs> using manually drawn regions of interest (ROIs) for the background and brain structure of interest. Activity maps were generated in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ec12e9705e-software-simple-6">MATLAB</rs> from Gaussian-smoothed, backgroundsubtracted images. A baseline fluorescence image was calculated as the average over a 10 s prestimulus interval. Minor z direction movement was ignored by correlating each frame to the baseline fluorescence and discarding it if the correlation fell below a threshold value. This threshold value was manually selected for each brain by noting the constant high correlation value when the brain was stationary and sudden drops in correlation when the brain moved. For each pixel, the difference between mean intensity during the stimulus and the mean baseline fluorescence (DF) was calculated. The DF during the presentation of a dummy stimulus (no odor) was subtracted to control for mechanical artifacts from the odor delivery system. If DF was less than two times the SD of the intensity of that pixel during the prestimulus interval, that pixel was considered unresponsive.</p>

            <p>In situ caspase-8 activity assay. To detect caspase-8 activity in situ in living microglia, a caspase-8 detection kit containing a specific and fluorescent FAM-LETD-fmk that covalently labels active caspase-8 was used according to the manufacturer's instruction (Image-iTs LIVE Green Caspase-8 Detection Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After live labeling of active caspase-8, microglia were fixed and subjected to immunocytochemistry as specified in the <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> legend. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope equipped with an Olympus DP70 digital camera. On the basis of the intracellular location of active caspase-8, the percentage of microglia with cytoplasmic diffuse caspase-8 signal (C-casp-8) and localized active caspase-8 (L-casp-8) was counted and analyzed across treatment conditions. Detection of intracellular ROS. Intracellular ROS production was evaluated by flow cytometry using the superoxide indicator hydroethidine (HE) <ref type="bibr">41,58,59</ref> and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Briefly, freshly isolated primary rat microglia were treated in suspension as specified in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> legend. At the end of the treatment, cells were incubated with 1mM HE and 10 nM Sytox green nucleic acid stain for 20 min at 37 1C, centrifuged at 100 Â g, resuspended in 100 ml of PBS containing 2% FBS and analyzed immediately using a flow cytometer equipped with 488 nm laser for excitation (Accuri C6, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Data were collected using FL1 for Sytox green nucleic acid stain (530±15 nm) or FL2 channel for HE (585±20 nm). A minimum of 10 000 cells were analyzed per condition. For time lapse microscopy, microglia seeded in slide chambers were loaded with 1 mM HE and 10 nM Sytox for 20 min, washed and subjected to LPS (0.1 ng/ml)/ zVAD-fmk (25 mM) stimulation. Images were manually acquired from the same chamber field at specified time points. To minimize photobleaching, cells were imaged with o0.5 s of exposure time for each filter. Fluorescence intensity of representative cells was analyzed with<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="eddd6011f8-software-0">Image J</rs> (<rs corresp="#eddd6011f8-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, MD, USA).</p>
            <p>Reverse transcription -PCR. Transcriptional expression levels of RIP1, RIP3, Iba1, TNFa, and b-actin in microglia upon stimulation with LPS and zVADfmk were examined as described previously. <ref type="bibr">57</ref> Using Tri reagent, total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual DNA was digested by incubating RNA samples with DNase I for 15 min at room temperature followed by DNase inactivation at 65 1C for 10 min according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The samples were reverse transcribed to cDNA using the reverse transcription system kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as described previously. <ref type="bibr">57</ref> Primers specific for b-actin were used as a loading control. All products were amplified by PCR using 50 ng of cDNA and the following specific primers: RIP1, forward 5 0 -GCACCAGCTGTCAGGGCCAG-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -GCCCAGCTTTCGGGCACAGT-3 0 ; RIP3, forward 5 0 -ACCTTGGCTGGCACTC CCCA-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -CCCCTGCCGAACTGTGCTGG-3 0 ; TNFa, forward 5 0 -GCC CACGTCGTAGCAAAC-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -GCAGCCTTGTCCCTTGAA-3 0 ; Iba1, forward 5 0 -CTTTTGGACTGCTGAAAGCC-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -GTTTCTCCAGCATTC GCTTC-3 0 ; and b-actin, forward 5 0 -AGACTTCGAGCAGGAGATGG-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -CCATCATGAAGTGTGACGTTG-3 0 .

            <p>Transmission electron microscopy. After a quick wash with PBS, microglia were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy 225 Sciences, Hatflield, PA, USA) in 0.1 M, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer overnight at 4 1C. Following three washes with 8% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, the cells were washed again in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and stained with 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.5% sucrose for 1.5 h. The cells were then dehydrated in ascending alcohol series and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections of microglia were examined using an FEI Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Digital images were acquired with a MegaViewIII camera operated with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="eddd6011f8-software-2">iTEM</rs> software (<rs corresp="#eddd6011f8-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Olympus Soft Imaging Systems</rs>, Germany).</p>
            <p>Statistical analysis.

            <p>All of the PCR primers used in this study were designed using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="a3e03f5c1b-software-0">Primer-BLAST</rs> (<rs corresp="#a3e03f5c1b-software-0" resp="#annotator1" type="url">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</rs>) and are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The first-round multiplex PCR amplification was performed in a 70-ml volume containing 5 ml of template DNA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2 mM MgCl2, 200 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.7-1 mM of each primer (0.7 mM for microsporidia and 1 mM for Cyclospora and Cryptosporidium), and 5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The second-round multiplex PCR amplification was performed under the same conditions, except 2 ml of template DNA (product of the firstround PCR) was used in a 30-ml final volume. Both amplifications were performed using a C-1000 DNA thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, California, USA) with initial denaturation at 94 ℃ for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94℃ for 30 sec, 53℃ for 30 sec, and 72℃ for 90 sec and a final extension at 72℃ for 10 min. The second-round PCR cycling conditions were identical to the first-round PCR except for the annealing temperature (55℃). Amplified DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis in a 2% (w/v) agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml) and visualized under <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3e03f5c1b-software-1">ImageQuant300</rs> (<rs corresp="#a3e03f5c1b-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GE Healthcare</rs>, Giles, UK).</p>
            <p>From the first-round PCR amplification, we obtained the following products with the predicted sizes: 644-657 bp, 636 bp, and 415-427 bp for microsporidia, C. cayetanensis, and Cryptosporidium, respectively (data not shown). From the secondround PCR, the following predicted PCR products were amplified: 410-420 bp, 294 bp, and 171-183 bp for microsporidia,C. cayetanensis, and Cryptosporidium, respectively <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. The lower detection limit of nested PCR amplification that was performed with template DNA from each individual protozoa was 10 2 spores for microsporidia, 10 0 oocysts for Cyclospora, and 10 1 oocysts for Cryptosporidium <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. The lower detection limit of multiplex PCR amplification that was performed with mixed DNA from each protozoan was 10 2 for microsporidia and Cyclospora and 10 1 for Cryptosporidium <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The primers for microsporidia and Cryptosporidium used in the present study are capable of detecting both E. bieneusi and E. intestinalis, and C. parvum and C. hominis, respectively. Restriction enzyme digestion of the resulting nested PCR products can distinguish the 2 kinds of microsporidia and Cryptosporidium spp. Restriction enzyme digestion with BsaBI showed 2 fragmented bands of 167 and 253 bp in E. intestinalis <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3A)</ref>, and with BsiEI showed no fragmented bands in C. parvum <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3B)</ref>. Whereas it was confirmed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="a3e03f5c1b-software-2">Clone Manager</rs> <rs corresp="#a3e03f5c1b-software-2" resp="#annotator1" type="version">6</rs> (<rs corresp="#a3e03f5c1b-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Sci-Ed</rs>, North Carolina, USA) that there will be no fragmented bands in E. bieneusi with BsaBI digestion and 2 fragmented bands of 48 and 137 bp in C. hominis with BsiEI digestion. Each primer set for microsporidia, C. cayetanensis, and Cryptosporidium used in the present study showed no cross-reactivity with each of the other parasite DNA <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Another advantage of the multiplex PCR test developed in the present study is that the 2 species of microsporidia, such as E. bieneusi and E. intestinalis, and the 2 species of Cryptosporidium, such as C. parvum and C. hominis, can be differentiated after PCR by restriction enzyme digestion. We did not show restriction enzyme-digested PCR products of E. bieneusi and C. hominis in the present study as we did not secure DNAs of these 2 organisms. Instead, we confirmed the results of restriction enzyme digestion of these 2 organisms after PCR using a restriction enzyme cutting software program (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="a3e03f5c1b-software-3">Clone Manager</rs> <rs corresp="#a3e03f5c1b-software-3" resp="#annotator1" type="version">6</rs>).</p>

            <p>The follow-up for each patient included chest radiography, laboratory tests, and CT. For evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, the absence of enhancement inside the tumor was taken to indicate technical success. A follow-up CT was conducted at intervals of 1, 3, and 6 months and then every 6 months over the years. One-month follow-up CT was performed to determine whether there was any remnant or residual enhancement of the ablated lesion. Complete treatment resulted when nonenhancement was achieved. The technical success rate was defined as complete ablation of the tumor following the initial procedure or additional sessions with a 1-month follow-up. Recurrence was defined as growth of the tumor or any new enhancing portions at 3 months after confirmed nonenhancement of the initial RFA lesion. Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's chi-square test, and repeated-measures analysis of variance between the two groups were used for analysis of the characteristics of each group.

The digested peptides were concentrated and analyzed on a Bruker Autoflex Speed MALDI TOF/TOF instrument. MALDI MS/MS was conducted on 15 peptides for peptide fragmentation analysis. The MS and MS/MS spectra were combined and used to search database with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="eda48c9f59-software-simple-0">Mascot</rs> software. Alternatively, the isolated proteins were analyzed by western blot.</p>

            <p>E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a and is upregulated in AML. We previously showed that miR-26a negatively regulates cell proliferation and stimulates myeloid differentiation of AML cells. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Notably, miR-26a negatively regulates G 1 /S transition in different tumors and this has been attributed, at least in part, to the direct regulation of EZH2 by miR-26a. <ref type="bibr">16,17,19,21</ref> However, we showed that EZH2 is not a direct target of miR-26a in AML cells. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Thus, we decided to investigate novel relevant targets for miR-26a function in AML. Between the putative targets of miR-26a, we noticed the E2F7 transcription factor (data from <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="adbb45e356-software-0">TargetScan</rs> (<rs corresp="#adbb45e356-software-0" resp="#annotator17" type="url">www.targetscan.org</rs>) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="adbb45e356-software-1">Pictar</rs> (<rs corresp="#adbb45e356-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">pictar.mdc-berlin.de</rs>)), an important regulator of the G 1 /S-phase transition. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> The 3'-untranslated region (3 0 -UTR) of E2F7 contained two highly conserved putative binding sites for miR-26a <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a)</ref>. To show the direct targeting of E2F7 by miR-26a, we constructed luciferase reporters containing the wild type (WT) 3 0 -UTR of E2F7 (WT), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site I (Mut1), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site II (Mut2) or the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at both miR-26a binding sites (Mut1-2). Luciferase reporters were individually co-transfected in HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing miR-26a or control <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b)</ref>. The expression of WT reporter was significantly decreased by miR-26a compared with control. Reporter Mut1 behaved similarly to WT, while deletion of Mut2 partially relieved translational repression. On the other hand, expression of the reporter construct mutated at both miR-26a binding sites of E2F7 3 0 -UTR (Mut1-2) was not sensitive to miR-26a translational repression. This may be explained by the fact that the binding of miR-26a on site II increases the accessibility to site I or, alternatively, binding of one repressive complex on site II may serve as scaffold for attracting cofactors necessary for repression on site I. These results demonstrated that miR-26a regulated E2F7 expression through direct binding of the 3 0 -UTR. To further demonstrate that miR-26a represses E2F7 expression in AML, U937 cells were infected with a lentivirus containing an miR-26a expression cassette (Lenti-26a) or control (Mock inf.). Enforced expression by lentiviral transduction significantly increased miR-26a levels with a concomitant decrease in E2F7 protein levels <ref type="figure">(Figure 2a)</ref>. Similar results were obtained with the HL-60 cell line (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Altogether, these data indicated that E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a in AML.</p>
            <p>RNA interference and miR-26a overexpression. E2F7 knockdown was obtained by Mission Lentiviral shRNA clones targeting E2F7 TRCN0000017455 and TRCN000017453 (Sigma-Aldrich). Mission Lentiviral Non-Targeting shRNA clone SHC002 (Sigma-Aldrich) was utilized as control.The miR-26a target E2F7 counteracts monocytic differentiation B Salvatori et al Lentiviral particles were prepared according to the manufacturer's specifications. Lentiviral vectors for miR-26a expression and control were described previously. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Infection of AML cell lines was performed as described previously. <ref type="bibr">40</ref> Cell proliferation and differentiation. For cell cycle analysis, 2 Â 10 5 cells were resuspended in PBS/50% FCS, fixed in 70% ethanol for 24 h, incubated with 50 Ag/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 U/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich), and analyzed after 3 h (10 000 events) using an Epics XL Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Morphology was evaluated after 7 days from lentiviral transduction in conventional light-field microscopy of Wright-Giemsa-stained cytospins.

Total RNA was prepared using Qiazol reagent and miRNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Hsa-miR-26a analysis by real-time PCR was performed using miRScript System (Qiagen) and E2F7 analysis was performed with QuantiTect Primer Assay QT00059115 (Qiagen). Delta-delta Ct values were normalized with those obtained from the amplification of the endogenous U6 snRNA (Qiagen). P-values between primary AML samples and monocytes data were obtained with t-test. cDNAs for p21, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 analysis were generated with miRScript RT Kit (Qiagen). Oligonucleotides are described in the primers list (shown below). M-CSF, M-CSFr and MafB were detected with TaqMan oligonucleotides Hs00166144_m1, Hs00234622_m1 and Hs00534343_s1, respectively, and normalized by the amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) Hs99999905_m1 (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Italia, Monza MB, Italy). MiR-17 and miR-20a were detected with TaqMan microRNA assay TM-393 and TM-580 (Applied Biosystems), respectively. Delta-delta Ct values were normalized with those obtained from the amplification of the endogenous U6 snRNA, TaqMan probe TM-1093 (Applied Biosystems).

            <p>This was a cross-sectional study for evaluating health related quality of life in lower limbs amputation veterans of Iran. In the present study, data collected from 38 lower limbs amputation veterans and 50 normal healthy controls that live in all provinces of Iran with face-to-face interview. The control group is matched in gender, education, and age with amputee group. All participants were male. Mean age for amputee group were 43.91 (± 6.21) and for normal healthy subjects were 43.66 (± 6.07). The duration of amputation was 24.55 (± 2.61) years. HRQOL was assessed by means of the Medical Outcomes Research 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), which has been validated in the Iranian population <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions integrating eight multi item scales: physical functioning (PF); role limitations caused by physical problems (RP); bodily pain (BP); general health perceptions (GH); vitality, energy, or fatigue (VT); social functioning (SF); role limitations caused by emotional problems (RE), and general mental health (MH). Based on these scales, component summary scores were calculated to provide a global measure of physical and mental functioning; the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) were derived from the eight multi-item scales. The scales and summary components ranged from 0 to 100, where higher values denote better functioning and fewer limitations. For each question basis on number of item in Lickert scale, each item pointed from 0 to 100. The SF-36 derived scores did not have a cutoff point to differentiate between good or poor Available at http://ijph.tums.ac.ir HRQOL. This questionnaire had been translated to Persian and validated for Iranian population. The internal consistency (to test reliability) showed that all eight SF-36 scales met the minimum reliability standard, the Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.90 with the exception of the vitality scale (alpha = 0.65) <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Inclusion criteria were amputation of lower limbs veterans based on observation. Veterans were excluded, as were severely mentally handicapped and subjects unable to understand Persian language.

            <p>At least eight capillary BG tests, using the BG meter built into the reader, were required to be performed on each day of the sensor wear, both at home and in the clinic. One strip lot was used to minimize lot-to-lot variation. The preferred testing was upon waking, before each meal, an hour after each meal, and at bedtime. Immediately after each BG test, participants obtained a confirmation of a successful sensor scan. Sensor readings were masked to participants, who were asked to maintain their established diabetes management plan. There was no manipulation of the glucose levels of the subjects except for their normal meal and insulin doses. Capillary BG tests coincided with venous YSI samples drawn during in-clinic visits. A linear mixed model was used to assess sensitivity and mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between insertion sites, with subject as a random effect and insertion site (left arm, right arm) and lot as fixed effects. The lag between the System sensor and YSI reference was evaluated using a model that characterizes delay with a time constant. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Analyses were carried out using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="de6efdab04-software-0">SAS</rs> version <rs corresp="#de6efdab04-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">9.2</rs> software (<rs corresp="#de6efdab04-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC).</p>

Each class of antiretroviral was considered in a separate analysis of the association between adherence and virologic failure in randomized clinical trials. Results are presented based on 9 categories, including study region, antiretroviral regimen, treatment experience, virologic failure cut-off points, adherence cut-off points, adherence measurement, study design, observation period, and year of publication. Adherence pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random effect model (DerSimonian and Lard) <ref type="bibr">9</ref> that accommodated the random variation within studies and between-studies. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Heterogeneity between-studies were examined using the Q and I 2 statistics. <ref type="bibr">9,11</ref> The odds ratio was plotted against the inverse of standard error to identify the risk of publication bias by visually assessing the symmetry of funnel plots. Statistical significance was confirmed using Egger's test, <ref type="bibr">12</ref> with a P value &lt;0.05 considered suggestive of publication bias. A metaregression was performed to examine major moderators of the between-studies heterogeneity. Results with P values &lt;0.1 from univariate analyses were included in the multivariate meta-regression model.</p>

            <p>Total RNA extracted from Huh-7 cells was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the RT2 First-Strand Kit (SA Biosciences, Germany). The cDNA was then combined with RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (SA Biosciences) and equal aliquots of this mixture were added to 96-well plates of the Human Apoptosis RT2 Profiler PCR Array (SA Biosciences) that contained the gene-specific primers, human ATGs PAHS012z (SA Biosciences). PCR was performed using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (ABI) with the following thermal cycling conditions: 15 min at 95 8 C for 1 cycle, 10s at 95 8 C, and 1 min at 60 8 C for 40 cycles. Expression of 84 key genes involved in apoptosis and 5 housekeeping genes (B2M, ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT1 and RPLPO) was profiled.

            <p>Expression Profiling Analysis-Lungs from fibrillin-1-deficient mice and littermate controls at postnatal day 1 (PD1) and postnatal day 5 (PD5) were harvested and quickly frozen. Lungs from two groups of mice (wild-type and fibrillin-1-deficient) at each time point were pooled in groups of two or three. Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Expression profiling was done with Affymetrix A734 GeneChips (48 chips for this study), containing ϳ7000 full-length genes and ϳ1000 expressed sequence tags. Biotinylated cRNAs prepared from total RNAs were hybridized to U34A GeneChips in duplicate. Fluorescent signals were measured with a Hewlett Packard G2500A Gene Array Scanner. Data were analyzed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="cc9396bef1-software-0">Affymetrix suite</rs> <rs corresp="#cc9396bef1-software-0" resp="#annotator12" type="version">5.0</rs>, corrected for saturation, and evaluated with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="cc9396bef1-software-1">GeneSpring</rs> <rs corresp="#cc9396bef1-software-1" resp="#curator" type="version">5.0</rs> software.

            <p>Western Blot Analysis-Total cell lysates were extracted in M-Per buffer from Pierce. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Aliquots of 30 -50 g of protein were boiled and then loaded onto Tris-HCl gels and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was by the Pierce West DuraImmunohistochemistry-Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in an ethanol series. Sections were blocked for nonspecific binding with 3% normal serum from chicken and incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. For immunofluorescence, sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies at 1:200 for 30 min at room temperature (Molecular Probes). Sections were counterstained with 4Ј,6-diamidinio-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted with Vectashield hard set mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). For immunohistochemistry, following incubation with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C, slides were washed with PBST, incubated with an appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and developed by using ABC protocol. 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and 3,3Ј-diaminobenzidine detection reagents (Vector Laboratories). Antibodies were used at the following concentrations: NeuroD (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),Neuroendocrine Cell Quantitation-For details of the protocol, refer to Ref. 14. To characterize NE differentiation in fibrillin-deficient mice and wild-type littermates, we counted the total number of synaptophysin, CGRP, and PGP9.5 immunoreactive solitary PNECs and NEBs (neuroendocrine foci) in formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung sections. This was correlated to the number of airways in the same sections (foci/ airway). To determine the size of NEBs in these same mice, pictures of each NEB were acquired using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="cc9396bef1-software-2">MetaMorph</rs> software (<rs corresp="#cc9396bef1-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Universal Imaging/Molecular Devices</rs>, Downingtown, PA). The immunoreactive area was manually outlined and measured using the same software, and the size in m 2 for each individual NEB was tabulated. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="cc9396bef1-software-simple-6">SigmaStat</rs>).</p>

Welch's t test was performed to calculate the probabilities of significant gene expression changes. Since the probe sets were tested multiple times, we used a highly stringent p value cut-off (p Ͻ 0.001) to reduce the number of false positives to less than 1 in 1000.</p>

            <p>Data were weighted to represent the U.S. diabetic population ages 18-64 years. Analyses were performed, using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3fc064949-software-1">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#a3fc064949-software-1" resp="#annotator2" type="version">9.2</rs> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3fc064949-software-2">SUDAAN</rs> <rs corresp="#a3fc064949-software-2" resp="#annotator2" type="version">10.0.1</rs> <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>, to adjust for the complex survey sample design. We conducted two-tailed t tests and considered results significant when P was ,0.05.Insurance coverage was associated with both frequency of health care use and routine place to go for health care; uninsured persons less frequently than the insured visited a doctor or other health care professional (e.g., 12.2% of uninsured persons reported not visiting a doctor during the past 12 months compared with only 2.1% of insured falling into this category). In the second-less-frequent health care use category (one to three times per year), uninsured were still more likely to fall into this category than insured (38.6 vs. 27%, respectively); on the contrary, in the ADArecommended category (four or more times per year), uninsured were less likely to fall into this category than insured (49.3 vs. 70.9%). They were more likely to report no routine place to go for health care (10.4 vs. 1.7%, P , 0.001). Furthermore, frequency of health care use was associated with diabetes control <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. In general, diabetes control profile was improved as the number of health care visits increased. Those who did not report a health care visit had poorer diabetes control outcomes than those who reported health care visits four or more times in the past year: mean A1C 9.1 vs. 7.4%, P = 0.014; mean systolic blood pressure 127.6 vs. 126.2 mmHg, P = 0.56; mean diastolic blood pressure 79.6 vs. 72.4 mmHg, P = 0.002; and mean non-HDL cholesterol 171.3 vs. 146.6 mg/dL, P , 0.001, respectively.</p>

            <p>Chi-square analysis was used to compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, unadjusted risks of adverse events, and mortality within 30 days between patients who received initial CTC and OC. Unadjusted risks of adverse events were included as these data have not been previously reported using claims data. Given the cohort study design a generalized linear regression with a logit link and binomial distribution was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of adverse events between patients undergoing CTC and OC by indication (i.e. symptomatic versus asymptomatic) controlling for differences in patient characteristics including gender, age, race, comorbidities associated with studied adverse events, and adverse events in the preceding 90 days. Due to low event rates for the targeted adverse events there is limited concern of overestimation of the risk ratio, which is approximated by the OR in cohort studies. Statistical significance was declared for results with a two-sided p-value of b 0.05.

            <p>Even though these 5 0 -SS sequences display some affinity for the SRSF1 RBD, our results do not necessarily imply that SRSF1 binds to these sequences within their natural cellular context. Our binding data simply suggest that the 5 0 -SS sequences bear some characteristics of a functional ESE, as predicted by <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e121790287-software-simple-0">ESEfinder</rs>.

            <p>The economic benefit of a U-healthcare system must become clear if the system is to be widely accepted. In other words, it must be shown that the medical and social cost reductions achieved are greater than the expenses associated with establishment, application, and maintenance of the system. Such costs include commercialization, provision of new devices, the labor of medical teams, systems maintenance, and server management. Any measure enhancing patient care and satisfaction, while minimizing personal expense, must be cost-effective <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref>. Artificial intelligence systems minimizing the medical manpower necessary for effective patient management are required. Such software would maximally reduce social and medical expenses. In fact, such a program (<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fca97123ef-software-simple-0">System for Automatic Verification, or SAVE</rs>) was recently applied inclinical research, and reduced physician labor by 50%, thus affording efficiency, stability, and economic benefit. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="fca97123ef-software-simple-1">SAVE</rs> will contribute to commercialization of U-healthcare systems by reducing labor costs <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>.</p>

            <p><rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-0">Hangman</rs> [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galgenm%C3% A4nnchen] is a classical game for two or more players in which one player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The game is over if the player needs more guesses than allowed. The idea of this game has been adapted within the project "<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-1">Mediman</rs>" so that medical terms must be guessed. At the end of each game the term is defined and explained to produce a benfit for the student (see <ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>). <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-2">Mediman</rs> uses a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-3">MySQL</rs> database to store the data and AJAX ("Asynchronus JavaScript and XML") to increase usability, e.g. no page reload is necessary to start a new game round as data is loaded in the background. During the development simulation programs where used that emulate the smartphones on the development PC. The benefit is that the developer does not actually has to own all the devices to run tests with them.</p>
            <p>To start the application the user needs to type in the internet adress (URL) -no installation is required. If the website is additionally added to the home screen a defined icon appears and the difference between a native application and a web site simulating it vanishes even more (see <ref type="figure">figure 1 and figure 2</ref>). Subsequent to the development process a questionnaire with nine items was desigend. If not declared otherwise a Likert scalling was used. Test users (n=20) were asked to submit the online forms between June and Juliy 2012 after they received an invitation via e-mail. All test users are students (third year or above) attending Faculty of Medicine of the University of Munich and took part voluntarily. The data analysis was performed with <rs corresp="#a6e72f552b-software-8" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-8">Excel</rs>.</p>
            <p>Smartphones are widely spread devices with plenty of possible applications due to their connection to the internet. The Faculty of Medicine of the University of Stanford for example picked up this trend and equip every new medical student with an Apple iPad since 2010 <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. Parallel to the introduction the faculty established a portal with learning material (presentations, videos, manuals and more) which can be accessed by the students for free using a app <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. This allows the students to access the needed material when they want and how often they want. So far, available e-learning programs, e.g. <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-6">CASUS</rs>, work within a desktop environment -and they do their job mostly fine. Those programs are therefore designed and optimised for desktop computers (with internet browsers), big screens and a computer mouse for interaction. The e-learning programs can be used with modern smartphones aswell but they are always suboptimal with respect to usability and legibility. The growing role smartphones play in our daily life due to their increasing market share demands an adaptation to the changed needs of the users. The analysis of the questionnaire showes that the test users think that smartphones are an ideal learning environment because most of them carry one with them all the time. This is comprehensible as for the first time ever more smartphones than desktop computers have been sold last year [http://www.canalys.com/ newsroom/smart-phones-overtake-client-pcs-2011]. The survey showed aswell that not enough learning applications specially designed for smartphones exist (see <ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>), the desire for them though is high (see <ref type="table">table 2</ref>). In our opinion the results however do not allow the conclusion that existing learning applications should simply be optimised for the smaller display sizes. The demands of the users seem to be more differentiated as they seem to look for short sessions explicitly. A test user submited the free text item covering the needs of the users with the comment that he or she would like to start sessions while travelling betwen two university locations or even when sitting in the train. Short texts and optimised cases for the repetition of knowledge seem the be more important than continuous text. Applications -generally speaking -can be produced as native applications for a chosen manufacturer or operating system (e.g.  <rs corresp="#a6e72f552b-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Apple</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-9">iOS</rs>, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-9">Android</rs>) and can then advertised and sold through the manufacturer's online store. The manufacturers support the developers by providing developmental environments and content (SDK).

            <p><rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-10">Mediman</rs> uses a different way. Instead of developing the application for the various operating systems individually the author used programming languages that are normally used to program websites (HTML, CSS, Javascript) in combination with a JavaScript framework called <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-11">jQuery mobile</rs>. This framework simulates a native application optically and because the necessary skills already existed no further longsome familiarisation with SDKs was necessary. This ensured a short development time, the list of supported devices of the framework is long and checks by the manufacturers prior to the aproval of an application to their online store does not exist. As a sort of hybrid technique <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-11">Phonegap</rs> (<rs corresp="#a6e72f552b-software-11" resp="#curator" type="url">http://phonegap.com</rs>) must be mentioned (web sites will be transformed and compiled into native apps) but was not chosen for the development of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-14">Mediman</rs> as it would have required training. Offering applications through the online stores means automatic avertising but web applications allow faster publication due to no certivication process.</p>
            <p>The results of the survey show that learning applications designed as a web site with an ideal integration into the smartphone -simulating a native application -seems to work for the test users. The users liked the adaptation of the game <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-15">Hangman</rs> into a medical learning program. The used JavaScript framework ensured fast developing and publishing. We did not find any relevant limitations using web site programming languages as no device specific function, e.g. motion sensor, was used. Those functions can normally only be used if the SDK is used. Uncertainty exists insofar as the analysis of the submited data of the test users did not show a clear trend if an active internet connection may be a requirement for running the learning application (see <ref type="table">table 2</ref>). The anxiety that this is explicitly a problem of the used programming languages used in the example project <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-16">Mediman</rs> can be qualified as version 5 of HTML supports storing data locally [http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html]. Apart from the technical aspect the author thinks that mobile plans with unlimited traffic are common. The importance of smartphones increases in learning environments. Today, only few learning applications designed to work seamlessly on smartphones exist -this is reflected in the usage frequency. It does not seem to be the one and only solution to adapt existing e-learning programs to fit into the small screen sizes because the needs of users is different. The survey showed that dealing with learning applications for smartphones will be an important topic in the future.<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-17">Mediman</rs>, the example project that was used mainly to demonstrate the potential and feasibility of the realisation of a small and simple learning application for smartphones was rated well within the questionnaire. As this was one of the main aims the project succeeded in our opinion and further devlopments should be considered.</p>

            <p>F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mouse tumors display partial inhibition of DNA damage p53-dependent regulatory network response. As commented above, the absence of pRb and p107 leads to partial impairment of p53-dependent functions. To further confirm these findings, we analyzed the expression patterns of p53-responsive genes in Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 compared with normal skin.

            <p>Methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Genomic DNA samples (1 mg) were modified by sodium bisulphite using the CpGenome DNA modification kit (Intergen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA methylation status of the promoter region of Pten and cdkn1a genes was analyzed by methylation specific PCR (MSP) after sodium bisulphite modification of DNA. Mouse genomic DNA universally methylated for all genes (Zymo Research) was used as a positive control for methylated alleles. Water blanks were included with each assay. Following amplification, PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis through a 2carcinomas. RNA was obtained from 4 normal wild type control skin samples and 10 carcinomas from Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 genotype, and purified from mice tissue as previously described <ref type="bibr">8</ref>. Hybridization was done to Affymetrix Mouse GE MOE430 2.0 array. Raw and processed data were deposited in the GEO database with the accession identifier GSE38257.

In each case, samples were grouped as normal or diseased, and a parametric t-test was per-formed to obtain genes with statistically significant differences. The p-value cutoff was set at 0.05 and a Benjamin Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction was included. These restrictions would allow about 5% of the tested genes on the GeneChip (total 54,675) to qualify by random chance. This gene list was further filtered to obtain genes that showed at least a two-fold differential expression between the normal and diseased states, which generated between 1,300 to 3,700 differentially expressed genes for the four cancer datasets <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>.

            <p>All analyses were conducted using the intention-to-treat principle. Analyses were conducted in<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="d54c0e7a43-software-0">Stata SE</rs> V.<rs corresp="#d54c0e7a43-software-0" resp="#annotator8" type="version">14</rs> (College Station, Texas, USA). We compared baseline covariates to examine the balance between intervention and control arms using count and percentages for categorical variables and median and IQR for continuous variables. We compared the same set of baseline covariates to determine whether loss to follow-up differed according to observed variables, including the study group. Proportions of participants who opted in for testing, were tested positive/negative, and took an ACT were compared by the study group. All primary end points are individual-level binary outcomes, modelled using a linear probability model (LPM),allowing us to interpret model parameters as probability differences. The LPM was specified as a generalised linear model for a binomial outcome with an identity link function. We summarised testing choice by the four randomised study groups by regressing the binary outcome on two factors (RDT subsidy and ACT subsidy) and their interaction to match the randomised 2×2 factorial study design. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> In addition to unadjusted group effects, we specified models with a full set of prespecified predictors: gender and age of the client, occupation and education level of the client or guardian (if client &lt;18 years), household size, wealth, and sublocation. Wealth was assessed as a composite score based on principal component analysis of ownership of basic household assets, using a polychoric correlation matrix to account for the categorical nature of the included assets. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The poorest 40% of participants were used as the comparator group. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> For the secondary end point of ACT consumption (an individual-level binary outcome) we used the same LPM modelling approach as for the testing-related outcomes. Models were stratified by test results for the subsample of clients who opted for a test. Since the interaction term was not significant in any of these models or in the primary testing outcome models, we excluded it in order to gain power and to improve model interpretation. Similarly, because we had not powered our study for these secondary end points, we reduced the set of prespecified predictors included in the primary outcome to the most parsimonious model with the best fit. To do so, we performed likelihood ratio tests and compared Akaike information criterion for subsets of the prespecified predictors. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The reduced set included wealth index only. Therefore, we only present the adjustment for the parsimonious model for the secondary end points and provide results from this parsimonious set for the primary outcome for comparison. Since testing outcomes relied on self-reports of testing behaviour, we conducted sensitivity analyses to determine whether model results persisted when the outcome was malaria testing at the CHW only (rather than the broader definition of any malaria test, including those conducted in a health facility) and when there was documented proof of the malaria test.</p>

            <p>Crude cancer incidence rates for all three cohorts were calculated as the number of cancer occurrences per 1000 person-years. The CCB cohort was compared to both, the non-CCB and AHT cohorts, with regard to cancer (all types). Cox regression models were conducted to estimate the crude and multivariable adjusted relative risk by calculating HRs and 95% CIs of cancer in relation to drug exposure (ever vs never exposed). Potential confounding factors in the relation between cancer and CCB exposure were accounted for in multivariable regression models and included: age at index date and sex (matching variables in the comparison with the non-CCB cohort), smoking status, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, diabetes, hypertension, arrhythmia, angina, or heart failure, as well as the use of statins or aspirin. These factors were chosen based on previous findings linking the variables with an increased risk of cancer. For the AHT cohort, separate analyses were performed for colon cancer, breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men. Additional analyses were also conducted using the AHT cohort to account for switching drug exposure, with models stratified according to the duration of cumulative exposure to drugs (0-5, 5-10 and &gt;10 years).

Distribution of continuous variables was investigated with the Shapiro-Wilk test in order to check whether the distribution was normal. Descriptive statistics were used as the mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. The statistical difference between the suprascapular notch measurements in both sexes were examined using the Mann-Whitney test. A p level of &lt; 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.</p>
            <p>The present study aimed to establish a new method of classifying the suprascapular notch (SSN) morphology, which, contrary to existing methods, is simple, easy to use, and based on specific geometric parameters that clearly distinguish each type. Based on this classification, the frequency of each type of SSN in females and males was described. To our knowledge, the literature contains no similar study on this subject based on anthropometric evaluation. The type of notch might then be considered in diagnosing the syndrome. The projection in which the SSN is visualized clearly is the anteroposterior projection with the X-ray tube angled 15-30°caudally <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>.In conclusion, using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="c65958b1a4-software-3">MultiScanBase</rs> v.<rs corresp="#c65958b1a4-software-3" resp="#annotator2" type="version">14.02</rs> software for measurements and typing suprascapular notches, we were able to establish a precise classification of SSN variations, and also, for the first time, present their distribution in female and male scapulas.</p>

            <p>In total, 18 NGS libraries were prepared, which were tagged by standard Illumina barcodes. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq and demultiplexed by <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="addb9a782c-software-simple-2">Illumina software</rs> (default parameters). For 8.52 % of the reads the barcode could not be identified unambiguously. These reads were excluded from further analysis. Another quality filtering step was imposed by our read-joining algorithm which requires that both reads of each read pair exhibit significant overlaps. 94.8% ± 1.81% of all read pairs could by joined successfully to one consensus sequence. Finally, the joined reads were classified and filtered again for occurrence of possible k1/k1 -boxes, which was the case for 90.6% ± 2.4%. In the end, compared to the original raw read numbers, on average 83.5% ± 2.2% of reads were used for the data analysis, which was equivalent to around 8.5 million read pairs.</p>

            <p>The Kaplan -Meier method was pre-specified as the method for evaluating the safety objective so all patients with an implant attempt could be included in the analysis. However, since no USADEs were observed, the exact binomial test comparing the observed 3-month USADE free rate to the null value of 85% was used to evaluate the safety objective and derive the lower 97.5% confidence interval (CI). A onesample t-test comparing the observed mean 3-month pacing capture threshold to the null value of 2.0 V was used to test the efficacy objective. In addition, paired t-tests were used to compare electrical variables measured at implant and the 3-month visit.

            <p>There are currently two validated indexes available for assessing the disease location and severity of small bowel CD with CE <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). The Lewis score evaluates three small bowel segments for the parameters villous appearance, ulcers and stenosis <ref type="bibr">[61]</ref>. The Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's Disease Activity Index. (CECDAI) evaluates the proximal and distal small bowel for the parameters inflammatory lesions, disease extension and stenosis <ref type="bibr">[62]</ref>. A software application for calculation of the Lewis score has been incorporated into the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="e1d96f6d5d-software-simple-0">RAPID Reader</rs> platform for Pillcam SB. The following cutoffs have been proposed: &lt;135, normal small bowel or clinically insignificant inflammation; 135-79, mild disease activity; and &gt;790, moderate to severe disease <ref type="bibr">[61]</ref>. The CECDAI is simpler to calculate, but cutoffs for endoscopic remission and different disease severities have not been properly established. However, there is a good correlation between the two indexes (r=0.63, P&lt;0.0001), and in a retrospective and unblinded single reader analysis, CECDAI levels of 3.8 and 5.8 corresponded to Lewis scores of 135 and 790, respectively <ref type="bibr">[40,63]</ref>.</p>
            <p><rs corresp="#e1d96f6d5d-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Given Imaging</rs>'s <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="e1d96f6d5d-software-1">RAPID Reader</rs> enables alterations of the viewing mode from single to dual or quad view, and the frame rate can be adjusted from 5 to 40 frames per second (fr/sec). Günther et al compared single view at a speed of 10 fr/sec with quad view at 20 fr/sec <ref type="bibr">[78]</ref>. The mean reading time was reduced from 22 down to 12 min, and detection rates of angioectasias, erosions, ulcers, and polyps were significantly lower with quad view. However, in patients with suspected or known CD, overlooked lesions did not change the result of the examination. Recently, Nakamura et al compared single view, dual view and quad view at different frame rates, using a small bowel video sequence with 60 pathological images of small bowel angioectasias <ref type="bibr">[79]</ref>. Increasing the frame rate from 10 to 15, 25 and 40 fr/sec resulted in a 33%, 60%, and 72% reduction in playing time, respectively, but at the expense of a drop in the number of lesions detected. Altering the viewing mode had no effect on the reading time for any given frame rate, but the detection rate was significantly higher with dual and quad view compared to single view. The authors conclude that the optimal combination for a high detection rate is 10 fr/sec using dual or quad view.</p>
            <p>Another way to decrease reading times is by reducing the number of images presented to the capsule endoscopist. The quick view function provided by <rs corresp="#e1d96f6d5d-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Given Imaging</rs>'s <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="e1d96f6d5d-software-2">RAPID Reader</rs> filters the number of images shown. With a sampling rate of 10% (default setting), 10% of images from the original videos is shown. Images are filtered according to a specific algorithm developed by the manufacturer, and sampling rates between 2% and 80% can be chosen. Shiotani et al examined how different sampling rates affect the detection rates of quick view CE <ref type="bibr">[80]</ref>. A variety of preselected lesions were included in the study. With sampling rates of 5%, 15%, 25% and 35%, 61%, 74%, 93% and 98% of lesions were detected. With a 25% sampling rate, only 7% of lesions were missed, and the reading time was reduced by approximately 50%. This setting was considered a proper tradeoff between reading times and detection rates. Koulaouzidis et al studied 81 patients with suspected or known CD <ref type="bibr">[81]</ref>. A total of 155 and 71 ulcerations were detected with CE and quick view CE, respectively, with a 35% sampling rate, corresponding to a miss rate of 54%. In patients with suspected or known CD, quick view CE was false negative (i.e. no or non-specific lesions or &lt;3 ulcerations) in 1 (7%) and 8 (10%) patients, respectively. In a study by our group, including 40 patients with suspected CD, standard view CE visualized 171 small bowel ulcerations, compared to 102 lesions detected with quick view CE (miss rate 40%, P=0.02) <ref type="bibr">[82]</ref>. However, with ileocolonoscopy and standard view CE as gold standard, quick view CE diagnosed 15 of 16 patients with small bowel CD, corresponding to a sensitivity of 94%, while 39 out of 40 patients were classified correctly overall (diagnostic accuracy 98%). Reading times varied from 5-18 min (median 10).</p>

            <p>Adult mice were euthanized with CO 2 overdose and sequentially perfused with ice-cold PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were collected and postfixed with 4% PFA for 4-6 hr or overnight at 4 C. Postfixed brains were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose solution in PBS for 24 hr and cut into 40-mm-thick sections with a sliding microtome (Leica). Brain sections were serially collected and stored in antifreezing solution at À20 C. Immunohistochemistry was performed essentially as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Niu et al., 2011)</ref>. Briefly, free-floating sections were rinsed with PBS and blocked with blocking solution (3% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature. These sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for at least 24 hr at 4 C followed by three rinses with PBST buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS). They were subsequently incubated with respective secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for over 2 hr at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 when appropriate. After extensive rinsing with PBST buffer, sections were mounted onto glass slides for microscopy. The following primary antibodies were used: GFP (A-11122, rabbit, 1:500, Invitrogen; GFP,Cell Signaling Technology), CC-1 (OP80; mouse; 1:500; Calbiochem), and ASCL1 (TX-518; guinea pig; 1:10,000; Jane Johnson). Alexa-488-, Alexa-Fluor-594-, or Alexa-Fluor-647-conjugated corresponding secondary antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch were used for indirect fluorescence. Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope.

Data were obtained from 12 random sections from three to five mice in each group.</p>
            <p>Adult mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with chilled (4 C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 11 mM D-glucose at pH 7.4, 300 mOsm, and aerated with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ), including 0.5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1% kynurenate acid. The striatum with overlying neocortex was then dissected out. Acute sagittal slices (250 mm thickness) were collected between +2 mm and À2 mm from bregma on a Leica VT1200S slicer. They were then incubated in aerated ACSF with 3 mM CaCl 2 and 2 mM MgCl 2 to recover for 30 min at 35 C followed by additional incubation for over 1 hr at room temperature. A single slice was then transferred to a submersion chamber and perfused at 3 ml/min with aerated ACSF at 30 C. Lineage-traced cells in the striatum were identified under visual guidance using IR-DIC optics and tdTomato fluorescence. Whole-cell currentclamp and voltage-clamp recordings were performed using glass pipettes ($6-9 MU) filled with intracellular solution (0.2 mM EGTA, 130 mM K-gluconate, 6 mM KCl, 3 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM ATP-Mg, 0.4 mM GTP-Na, and 14 mM phosphocreatine-Tris at pH 7.2 and 285 mOsm). Intracellular solution was supplemented with 0.5% biocytin (B4261; Sigma) for biocytin labeling. All recordings were obtained with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier. Currents were filtered at 2 kHz, acquired, and digitized at 10 kHz using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="d2bb49b2ae-software-1">Clampex</rs> <rs corresp="#d2bb49b2ae-software-1" resp="#annotator18" type="version">10.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#d2bb49b2ae-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>). APs were recorded in current clamp mode and elicited by a series of current injections starting from À160 pA with 20-, 40-, 80-, or 160-pA increments and 800 ms duration. Sodium and potassium currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode in response to a series of voltage steps ranging from À60 mV to +60 mV at 10-mV increments and 100 ms duration. Delayed rectifier potassium currents (K d ) were measured 50 ms prior to the end of current step. Spontaneous synaptic currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode. In all voltage-clamp recordings, cells were clamped at À60 mV or À80 mV, whichever is close to the resting membrane potential of the cell except during the voltage-step protocol. In all current-clamp recordings, recordings were made at the resting membrane potential or without any current injection. Series and input resistance were measured in voltage-clamp mode with a 400 ms, À10 mV step from a À60 mV holding potential (filtered by 10 kHz, sampled at 50 kHz). Cells were accepted only if the series resistance was less than 30 MU and stable throughout the experiment.

            <p>the wash retrieved from the U-Pb chemistry (see the Supplementary Materials for analytical details). This approach allows us to unambiguously link Hf isotope compositions to the U-Pb ages <ref type="bibr">(28)</ref>. The Lu/Hf of each zircon was measured by ICPMS on an aliquot of the same solution to correct for in situ radiogenic growth of <ref type="bibr">176</ref> Hf since zircon crystallization. The effects of possible neutron capture on the Apollo 14 zircon Hf isotopic ratios were assessed by examining the deviation of their 178 Hf/ 177 Hf ratios from normal (terrestrial and chondritic) values <ref type="bibr">(24, 29)</ref>. Most of our zircons [as well as the zircons analyzed by Taylor et al. <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>] have been affected to some degree by cosmic ray exposure with offsets up to 2.14 e 178 Hf from the terrestrial value <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. We corrected for these effects using the data and procedure of Sprung et al.Hf(t) values, shown as a function of crystallization age in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, are the lowest measured in lunar materials, with the least radiogenic samples in the Apollo 14 population having initial <ref type="bibr">176</ref> Hf/ 177 Hf ratios within 1 to 2 e units (0.01 to 0.02%) of the solar system initial value (Supplementary Materials) <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>. These data indicate the formation of the zircons in a highly enriched magma, termed urK-REEP <ref type="bibr">(30)</ref>, which agrees with the previous conclusions of Taylor et al. <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. However, the precision of the data presented here and the corrections for cosmic ray exposure <ref type="formula">(23)</ref> Hf source = 0, which corresponds to the maximum elemental fractionation possible for the reservoir that the zircons crystallized from. Although this represents extreme Lu/Hf fractionation, it is reasonably consistent with expectations for fractional crystallization of an LMO and production of zircon in the last residual melt (urKREEP). A <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a24a93c721-software-simple-0">pMELTS</rs> simulation <ref type="formula">(31)</ref> Hf during KREEP crystallization shows that it quickly evolves to &lt;0.01 at less than 50% melt remaining (Supplementary Materials). Any choice of a higher Lu/Hf ratio for the source necessarily yields older model separation ages; our results therefore provide minimum ages for differentiation of the LMO from CHUR and a minimum age for the formation of the Moon. Our model age results are presented in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, together with those from Taylor et al. <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref> corrected for neutron capture effects. Because some of the Apollo 14 zircons with initial e 176 Hf(t) values closer to chondritic could be derived from KREEP-rich magmas that had undergone partial assimilation of crustal rocks, we take the oldest model ages as the minimum age for LMO solidification. To determine this minimum age, we averaged the four oldest zircon Lu/Hf model ages, resulting in 4.51 ± 0.01 Gy (1s).This study Taylor et al. <ref type="bibr">(20 )</ref> Taylor et al. <ref type="bibr">(20 )</ref>, NC-corrected CHUR</p>
            <p>All data reduction, error propagation, and U-Pb data plotting were done using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a24a93c721-software-simple-1">U-Pb_Redux</rs> software package <ref type="bibr">(48)</ref>. All reported uncertainties were 2s and included only internal sources of uncertainty (counting statistics, uncertainties in correcting for mass discrimination, and the uncertainty in common Pb composition). Forty procedural blanks spiked with the same tracers and run within a period of 3 years (21 of which in the course of this study) showed an amount of common Pb (Pbc = 0.2 to 13.9 pg; average, 3.6 pg) that agreed well with that found in zircon analyses; therefore, all common Pb was assumed to be derived from procedural blanks. <ref type="figure">A and B)</ref>. U-Pb results show that L1 and some of L2 analyses had low radiogenic-tocommon Pb ratios and were discordant (table S1B), whereas most of the residues and L2 have high radiogenic-to-common Pb ratios and are concordant (table S1A). This illustrates that the chemical abrasion technique efficiently removed portion of grains that were affected by Pb loss. Hf measurements were performed only on the most concordant grains (tables S1A and S3), which are plotted on <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> in a traditional concordia plot.</p>

            <p>The diagnostic amino acid residues, namely a diglycine followed by a tyrosine, six nonconserved amino acids, and a tryptophan residue are highlighted with gray background. This pattern is disrupted in the first kelch repeat of all three cyclostome proteins where the first glycine ("G") is replaced by an alanine residue ("A"). Another nonconserved site is a phenylalanine ("F") instead of a tyrosine ("Y") in the fourth kelch repeat of the chicken ENC3 protein. Because of similar physiochemical properties, these substitutions do not necessarily prevent the characteristic folding of the mature protein and thus its cellular function. Interestingly, the first kelch repeat of all vertebrate ENC proteins lacks the tryptophan residue and thus does not show the described motif. (B) A phylogenetic tree of the three ENC subgroups of jawed vertebrates, three cyclostome homologs, and the Branchiostoma floridae gene "XP_002612442" as outgroup is shown. Support values are shown for each node in order, bootstrap probabilities in the ML tree inference, and Bayesian posterior probabilities. Analysis is based on 311 amino acids, and the JTT + I + F + À 4 model was assumed (shape parameter of gamma distribution a ¼ 0.66). Red arrows denote sequences that are newly reported in this study.

            <p>The aforementioned 5 0 -and 3 0 -cDNA fragments of S. canicula ENC1 were used as templates for riboprobes used in in situ hybridizations. Paraffin-embedded section in situ hybridizations using S. canicula embryos were performed as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Kuraku et al. 2005)</ref>, with the modification that the acetylation step and the proteinase K treatment were skipped.

Zebrafish standard whole-mount in situ hybridizations and double in situ hybridizations using the enc1 riboprobes labeled with digoxigenin-UTP and the egr2b riboprobes labeled with Fluorescein (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) were performed as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Begemann et al. 2001; Manousaki et al. 2011)</ref>. In double in situ staining, enc1 transcripts were detected using nitro blue tetrazolium/ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP) and egrb2 transcripts by a p-Iodonitrotetrazolium/BCIP-based detection. Stained embryos were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Immunohistochemistry on whole-mount S. canicula embryos was performed as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Kuratani and Eichele 1993)</ref> with minor modifications. Monoclonal anti-acetylated tubulin antibody (Sigma T7451) was used to detect developing axons.

T-test was used to analyze any statistically significant difference between gender, nationality, and brushing habits with prevalence of caries. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to check the significance between age and caries prevalence. The level of significance was set at 0.05. Post hoc test was also used to check for any significant increase, or decrease in dental caries due to increase in age. Inter-examiner agreement was analyzed using Kappa statistics, and a high degree of agreement (Kappa index: 89.7%) was observed between the 2 examiners.</p>

Molecular analyses were carried out for the original production water and incubated water from [2-13 C]-acetate labeled microcosms (at day 116 and 103 for the control and the CO 2 -injected microcosms, respectively). Total DNA was extracted from a 0.22-mm-pore-size polycarbonate membrane filter (Millipore, MA, USA), concentrating 250 ml of the original production water, 15 ml of the control microcosm water and 40 ml of the CO 2 -injected microcosm water, using a FastDNA Spin kit (MP Biomedicals, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified with primer sets Eub8F/Univ1490R 24 and Ar109F 25 /Univ1490R, respectively.

            <p>By far the highest induced miRNA tested in our analysis was miR-205. The exact significance of this induction for adipogenesis remains unclear for now. However, the list of predicted target mRNAs for miR-205 includes, for example, Runx2 (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="a0e821b549-software-3">TargetScan</rs> <rs corresp="#a0e821b549-software-3" resp="#annotator7" type="version">5.2</rs>), a transcript encoding a transcription factor with an important role in favoring osteoblastogenesis over adipogenesis during mesenchymal stem cell differentiation <ref type="bibr">(42)</ref>. High levels of PPARg are known to suppress RUNX2 protein expression and induction of miR-205 might serve as a mechanism to achieve this suppression. Indeed, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr">(43)</ref> recently showed that miR-205 can attenuate RUNX2 protein accumulation together with nine other miRNAs in mouse osteoblasts. However, our preliminary experiments have so far failed to demonstrate reduction in Runx2 mRNA levels upon miR-205 overexpression in pre-adipocytes (data not shown), suggesting that a combinatorial function of multiple miRNAs might be required for robust regulation of Runx2 at the mRNA level. Consistently, we were so far unable to demonstrate any significant impact of miR-205 overexpression on early adipogenesis in general, as measured by the expression levels of the known adipocyte marker genes such as Pparg and Cebpa (data not shown). Proteomeor transcriptome-wide analysis upon gain-or loss-offunction of miR-205 would be needed to reveal the primary targets mRNAs and pathways regulated by the robust induction of miR-205 during adipogenesis.</p>

            <p>The linkage used probabilistic matching 37 using the record linkage software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b2c0640c43-software-simple-0">ChoiceMaker</rs>, <ref type="bibr">38</ref> together with clerical review of possible matches. Probabilistic matching assigns a weight to pairs of records based on how likely they are to be a true match based on a comparison of name, date of birth and address. Records with high weights are considered a true match while those with low weights are false matches; uncertain matches undergo clerical review. The cut-off for determining whether a match is true or false is chosen as to minimise the number of false positives, false negatives and the number of clerical reviews. <ref type="bibr">39</ref> The linkage algorithms take into account name reversals, name shortenings and a limited number of keystroke errors in date of birth. The CHeReL routinely performs these linkages, and standard operating procedures exist to fine tune the linkage sensitivity and specificity depending on the cohort data being linked. CHeReL follows established quality assurance processes for their master linkage key, linkage procedures and linkage staff. In general, these processes achieve false positive rates of 0-5/1000 and false negative rates of &lt;1/1000. However, the quality of the probabilistic matching process is highly dependent on the quality of the data provided, and in the case of DVA clients, important linkage variables such as name, date of birth and death and address histories are well documented. For example, an audit of the first CCR, APDC and EDDC linkages found a false positive rate of 0.4% and a false negative rate of &lt;0.5%. Moreover, individual research projects conducted under the auspices of this programme start with a comprehensive review of the cohort to minimise the inclusion of false positive cases. This is carried out by identifying and excluding cases where there are discrepancies between dates of birth and death across different databases or in circumstances where a client has observations of health resource use after their date of death.</p>

            <p>The primary endpoint was comparison of steady-state pharmacokinetics of simeprevir between subjects with severe renal impairment and matched subjects with normal renal function. The secondary endpoint was short-term safety and tolerability. No formal sample size determination was performed; a sample size of eight subjects per group was considered sufficient for pharmacokinetic assessment. Subjects who received at least one dose of the study medication were included in the analysis (intentionto-treat population). Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ccccf2e977-software-0">WinNonlin Professional</rs> TM version <rs corresp="#ccccf2e977-software-0" resp="#annotator7" type="version">4.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#ccccf2e977-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Pharsight Corporation</rs>, Mountain View, CA, USA). Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD]) were calculated for total and unbound plasma concentrations at each time point. For the full pharmacokinetic profile, the minimum plasma concentration (C min ), maximum plasma concentration (C max ), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve at 24 h (AUC 24 ) on the logarithmic scale were the primary pharmacokinetic parameters of interest. A linear mixed-effects model (controlling for renal function) was used to estimate the least-squares (LS) means for each of the parameters. A 90 % confidence interval (CI) was created around the difference between the LS means in the renal impairment and control groups. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for the comparison of the time to maximal plasma concentration (T max ) between groups. No formal hypothesis testing was performed.</p>

            <p>After irradiation, muscles were washed once in KHB at 18°C to remove excess GP15 label and were then transferred to fresh KHB and incubated at 30°C to initiate internalization of the biotin-tagged GLUT4. At the specified internalization time points, 80 g/ml avidin (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL) was added for 6 min at 30°C to block transporters that were still at the cell surface. Muscles were rinsed four times in ice-cold PBS, frozen directly in liquid nitrogen, and stored at Ϫ80°C until analysis. The maximum signal of GLUT4, which internalized and escaped the surface quenching, was determined in each experiment from insulin-or AICAR-stimulated samples that were returned to the basal state and allowed to internalize the biotinylated GLUT4 for 60 min. Initial GLUT4 signal was determined in samples incubated without the addition of avidin. Exocytosis of GLUT4. For exocytosis experiments, human vastus lateralis muscles or rat epitrochlearis muscles were incubated at 35 or 30°C, respectively. After 20 min, muscles were transferred to fresh KHB containing 12 nmol/l insulin. Insulin-stimulated muscles were photoaffinity labeled with GP15 and subsequently washed with MES buffer (KHB with MES replacing HEPES), pH 6.0, for 5 min to terminate insulin stimulation. Muscles were maintained in KHB for 40 min to obtain maximal internalization. To begin the determination of exocytosis, 160 g/ml avidin was added for 6 min. Thereafter, muscles were transferred to KHB with or without 120 nmol/l insulin or 1 mmol/l AICAR for specified times. The rate of loss of the internal transporters as they became quenched by the surface avidin was determined at the indicated time points. Curve fitting and analysis of rate constants. Values for net internalization of GLUT4 under steady-state conditions were curve fitted using a twoparameter equation: F ϭ (1.0 Ϫ E).exp(Ϫk.t) ϩ E, where F is the fraction of GLUT4 remaining at the surface, E is the equilibrium position for internalization, k is the net internalization-rate constant, and t is time. The contributions from exocytosis (kex) and endocytosis (ken) to the progress to equilibrium were determined using the following equation: F ϭ {kex ϩ ken.exp[Ϫt.(kex ϩ ken)]}/(kex ϩ ken) <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. Values for unidirectional exocytosis of GLUT4 were curve fitted to a single exponential equation: F ϭ exp(Ϫ k.t), where F is the fraction of GLUT4 remaining internal, and k is the exocytosis rate constant, and t is time. Individual experiments were analyzed, and the resulting parameters were used to obtain mean and SE values, which were then compared in unpaired t tests. Differences were considered significant at P Ͻ 0.05. Analysis and curve fitting were carried out using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="c9f2caf097-software-simple-0">Graphpad Prism</rs> software.</p>

The samples were denatured and reduced with 8 M urea/10 mM dithiothreitol and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide. The samples were then digested with trypsin in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and desalted by C18 columns. The tryptic peptides were then analyzed using a Q Exactive™ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Dionex UltiMate ® 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were separated by liquid chromatography using C18 columns (75×150 mm, 2 μm, Dionex Acclaim ® PepMap™ RSLC; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The separation conditions have been described previously. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Full mass spectrometry (MS) scans were performed using ranges of m/z 380-2,000, m/z 380-600, m/z 600-800, m/z 800-1,200, and m/z 1,200-2,000, and the ten most intense ions from the MS scans were selected for MS/MS scans. The raw data were processed into peak lists using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator24" type="software" xml:id="e986ef5f26-software-1">Proteome Discoverer</rs> <rs corresp="#e986ef5f26-software-1" resp="#annotator24" type="version">1.3</rs> for <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e986ef5f26-software-simple-2">Mascot</rs> database searching (<rs corresp="#e986ef5f26-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Matrix Science</rs>, London, UK) and National Center for Biotechnology Information UniProt database prediction and literature searching. The search parameters included variable modifications for deamidation (NQ), oxidation (M), and a fixed modification for carbamidomethyl (C). The maximum mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and to 0.05 Da for fragment ions.</p>

            <p>In vivo micro-CT Specimen scans were performed with a SkyScan 1172 high-resolution micro-CT (SkyScan N.V., Kontich, Belgium). Prior to scanning the specimens, a calibration scan was performed using synthetic bone, water, and air samples. The exposure parameters were 70 kV and 140 mA. The number of projections was 481 and there were 938 cross-sections. The total scan time was 20 min. The scanned images were reconstructed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b69c6c99dd-software-simple-0">SkyScan CT-Analyser</rs> software and a modified cone-beam algorithm <ref type="bibr">14</ref> with 0.027 mm30.027 mm30.027 mm isotropic voxel spacing. The reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) image was then traced to the circumference of the original defect margins. This allowed the creation of a 3D reconstruction of the defect, which here after was referred to as the region of interest.

            <p>The surgical protocol was the same for both groups, besides the type of the alignment guide for the distal femoral resection (extramedullary/intramedullary). In particular, all patients received epidural and spinal anesthesia and the preoperative and postoperative procedures and surgical techniques were identical. Patient-controlled analgesia was implemented postoperatively using a 100 mL mixture of 90 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.5 mg/10 mL fentanyl via an epidural catheter. All operations were performed by the same surgeon (first author) using a medial parapatellar approach introduced by Insall. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was removed and the same PCL-sacrificing prosthesis (Scorpio NRG, Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) was implanted in all knees. The patella was replaced, and the prosthetic components were cemented in all cases. Lateral release was not performed in all patients. Two markers indicating the center of the femoral head and the anterior margin of the greater trochanter were firmly attached to the patient's skin in the EM group prior to surgery so the surgeon could palpate the markers and identify the mechanical axis of the lower limb during surgery. A femoral cutting block was aligned along the coronal and axial axes using new surgical equipment <ref type="bibr">16)</ref> and the two markers. The distal femur was cut without placing a rod into the medullary canal <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. The angle between the anatomical axis and the mechanical axis of the femur in the IM group was measured using a PACS system on a preoperative anterioposterior long leg standing radiograph. An intramedullary alignment rod was inserted based on the preoperative measurements, and the distal femur was cut. The entrance hole for the alignment rod in the femoral medullary canal was sealed with bone fragments before inserting the implant. An extramedullary alignment guide was used in both groups for proximal tibial cutting. A drainage tube was placed in the intra-articular space. After wound closure, a compression dressing using gauze and a bandage was applied, and the tourniquet was deflated. Drainage was discontinued from immediately after surgery until 2 hours after tourniquet deflation. All drains were removed 24 hours after surgery. Blood transfusion was performed when hemoglobin was &lt;8 g/dL or when dyspnea, palpitation, dizziness, or abnormal vital signs were noted even if the hemoglobin was 8-10 g/dL. Rivaroxaban, an oral anticoagulant, was administered from immediately after the drain removal until the postoperative week 2 to prevent thromboembolic disorders.

            <p>Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNAs were then reverse-transcribed using a Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) with the oligo(dT)15 primer according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR was performed with a GoTaq® Green Master Mix PCR kit (Promega) in 20 μL of total reaction mixture containing 1 μL of the RT-reaction mixture and 0.5 μL of each primer (forward and reverse, 15 μM). The PCR primers sets and the thermocycling parameters used are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The PCR samples were analyzed electrophoretically on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.2 mg/mL ethidium bromide at 90 V for 1 h. The bands were visualized under UV light. GAPDH transcripts served as internal controls. mRNA band density was quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a70a742b04-software-0">SigmaGel</rs> software (<rs corresp="#a70a742b04-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Jandel Scientific</rs>, San Rafael, CA, USA).</p>
            <p>Western blotting was used to analyze IL-4 and IL-13 protein expression. The treated cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.1 M EDTA, 0.1 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). The protein content of the whole cell lysate was measured with a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Whole cell lysates were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). After blocking, the membranes were incubated first with mouse anti-ratIL-4 or mouse anti-rat IL-13 antibody (1:500) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL Western Blot Detection System (GE Healthcare) and the protein band densities were quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a70a742b04-software-simple-2">SigmaGel</rs> software.</p>
            <p>Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation, and are the average values of three to five values per experiment.

The experiments were repeated at least twice to confirm the results. Analysis of variance was conducted, and Duncan's multiple-range tests were used to determine significant differences between groups. The level of statistical significance was set to P &lt; 0.05.</p>
            <p>We also investigated the effect of SCWE or DSCWE treatment on IgE-antigen complex-induced IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-α protein production by Western blot analysis (IL-4 and IL-13) and ELISA (TNF-α). The Western blot results were analyzed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a70a742b04-software-simple-6">SigmaGel</rs> software (Figs. 4B, 4C, 5B and 5C). The data showed that stimulating with the IgE-antigen complex increased IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-α protein levels in RBL-2H3 cells, and that treatment with 250, 500, and 1,000 μg/mL SCWE reduced IL-4 and IL-13 protein levels <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4A-C)</ref>. DSCWE at 500 and 1,000 μg/mL also reduced IL-4 and IL-13 protein levels <ref type="figure">Fig. 5A-C)</ref>. The inhibitory effect of SCWE was slightly more potent than that of DSCWE (Figs. 4A-5C). Moreover, SCWE or DSCWE treatment (100, 250, 500, and 1,000 μg/mL) led to a reduction in TNF-α protein levels, compared with that of untreated IgEantigen complex-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6A and 6B)</ref>.</p>

            <p>All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. The relationship between the main and secondary outcomes and the effect of the intervention were examined with generalied linear mixed models (GLMM), accounting for clustering of patients within physicians. ORs for follow-up versus baseline within the two groups were calculated, adjusting for covariates that differed between baseline and follow-up patient populations; thus, the covariates included in these adjusted analyses included race, and clinical diagnosis of hypertension or depression. GLMM was implemented by PROC GLIMMIX in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="af73d8ff40-software-simple-0">SAS</rs> and was adjusted for race, and clinical diagnosis of hypertension or depression. Thus, the group coefficient represented differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline; the time of coefficient represented changes in the control group over time, thus capturing temporal trends. Finally, the group-by-time interaction coefficient represented the difference-of-differences for over-time change in the intervention versus control group, and was a direct comparison of over-time change for the intervention versus the control group. A positive OR meant that the odds of a patient being in control increased more over time for the intervention versus control group.

            <p>EITL was defined as a primary intestinal T-cell lymphoma with characteristic morphology, typically with cytotoxic, CD3+ CD8+ CD56+ EBER − phenotype. Five snap frozen primary tumors and matched whole blood samples were obtained from the SingHealth Tissue Repository. The patients were recruited from 2010 to 2014 and all provided signed informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. An additional 41 archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples collected from 2003 to 2014 were obtained from the following centers: National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore General Hospital, National University Hospital and Tan <ref type="bibr">19,20</ref> Only <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e320fe242f-software-simple-0">Integrative Genomics Viewer</rs>-true mutations were considered somatic and variants with frequency ⩾ 15% were further validated by Sanger sequencing <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table 2</ref>).</p>
            <p>Prevalence screening was performed for GNAI2, JAK3 and STAT5B genes in 42 tumor samples using amplicon deep sequencing. Only common hotspots reported in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e320fe242f-software-7">COSMIC</rs> v.<rs corresp="#e320fe242f-software-7" resp="#annotator2" type="version">72</rs> and regions identified through WES were sequenced for each gene (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). CREBBP mutation frequency was determined in a partial prevalence cohort (16 cases) using Single Primer Enrichment Technology (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA, USA). SNP genotyping array and allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors Genomic DNA from four tumor-normal pairs was hybridized to GenomeWide Human Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Array 6.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) chips. Allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors was performed as described previously. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Stable cell line construction and western blot Full-length GNAI2 cDNA was amplified using AccuPrime Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cloned into retroviral vector MIGR1 (Addgene; plasmid no. 27490) <ref type="bibr">22</ref> at XhoI and EcoRI sites.Ex vivo cell viability assay in primary EITL cells Primary EITL cells from patient 065T were subcutaneously injected into the NOD scid gamma (NSG) mouse (P1; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA), followed by further passaging of the subcutaneously formed tumor cells by subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection (P2). Eight-weekold female animals were used in each passage. P2 mouse presented with highly swollen peritoneum, and intestinal and peritoneal tumors. All samples, including peritoneal fluid cells from P2, were histologically characterized by a senior hematopathologist (SYT) and diagnosed EITL. Owing to the consistent phenotype between patient's primary tumor and P2 peritoneal fluid cells, we will refer to the latter as primary EITL cells henceforth. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of all somatic mutations identified in the original tumor (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>) also in the primary cells. Animal experiments were in compliance with ethical regulations of the SingHealth Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>
            <p>Identification of somatic variants by WES To identify somatic mutations in EITL, we performed WES of four tumors with matching whole blood samples <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a)</ref>. To maximize variant detection from a limited sample size, three different variant callers were applied-<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e320fe242f-software-simple-3">Genome Analysis Toolkit</rs>, <ref type="bibr">24</ref> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e320fe242f-software-simple-4">MuTect</rs> <ref type="bibr">25</ref> and <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e320fe242f-software-simple-5">Strelka</rs>. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> The mean depth of coverage was 126 × and on average 88% of targeted bases were covered by at least 20 reads (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>). Sanger validation of 296 candidate variants showed a false-positive rate of 3.72%. EITL samples presented a high mutation burden with an average of 85 mutations per sample (range 59-137). A total of 340 nonsynonymous somatic mutations were identified in 313 genes. Seven of those genes also harbored silent somatic mutations (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). Among those were the calcium ionbinding gene multiple EGF-like-domains 6 (MEGF6), regulator of cell size proline-rich 16 (PRR16) and the giant muscle protein Titin (TTN), genes with functions in neuronal migration, axon guidance and chemoattraction-Reelin (RELN), Roundabout 1 (ROBO1) and Semaphorin 3 A (SEMA3A)-and with functions in the movement and transportation of cilia-Dynein 9 (DNAH9) and Intraflagellar Transport 140 (IFT140). In addition, mutations were identified in the histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) and two (putative) histone methyltransferases-additional sex comblike transcriptional regulator 3 (ASXL3) and SET domain-containing 2 (SETD2)-suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation may have a role in EITL.</p>
            <p>Prevalence screening of GNAI2, JAK3, STAT5B and CREBBP The high frequency of STAT5B, JAK3 and GNAI2 mutations in a small discovery cohort of only four samples was intriguing, prompting us to further analyze the prevalence of these mutations in a larger series of EITL samples. Forty-two additional EITL tumors (1 snap frozen and 41 archival samples) were screened for GNAI2, JAK3 and STAT5B mutations using amplicon deep sequencing. A total of 57 identified mutations were covered by an average of 20 004 reads (range 104-175 515; Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>). As the amplicons covered only common mutation hotspots reported in<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e320fe242f-software-12">COSMIC</rs> v.<rs corresp="#e320fe242f-software-12" resp="#annotator2" type="version">72</rs> and positions identified in the discovery cohort, it is likely that our results are lower-bound estimates of the true mutation frequency of these three genes. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> summarizes the results from both the discovery and prevalence cohorts. <ref type="figure">(Figure 2c)</ref>. We identified two samples carrying two separate JAK3-activating mutations and a remarkable three activating mutations were identified in a third case indicating profound alteration of JAK3 function in these patients. Notably, none of these samples contained an activating STAT5B mutation <ref type="figure">(Figure 2a)</ref>. Collectively, the JAK-STAT pathway was altered in 32/42 (76%) cases. It is remarkable that a large subset of tumors harbor co-occurring activating mutations in two members of the same pathway. A similar phenomenon was recently described for JAK1 and STAT3 in systemic ALK-negative anaplastic large T-cell lymphomas. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> Moreover, these mutants were demonstrated to act in synergy to constitutively activate downstream STAT3 signaling. Further studies for mutated JAK3 and STAT5B are thus warranted and might shed light on EITL tumorigenesis. GNAI2 mutations were observed in 9/42 (21%) samples. Two major hotspots were identified-p.R179 and p.T182-both located in the GTP-binding domain <ref type="figure">(Figure 2d)</ref> and are known activating variants. <ref type="bibr">31-33</ref> A single case was found to contain both mutations. Although exhibiting a lower mutation incidence compared with STAT5B and JAK3, it has been suggested that the lower frequencies for G protein α-subunits could be explained by mutations in receptors coupled to these G proteins. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> On that note, both the GNAI2 wild-type discovery cohort samples harbored somatic mutations in GPCRs (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>). It would be therefore interesting to analyze the mutational prevalence of GPCRs and other members of Gα i signaling in a larger cohort to determine the frequency at which this cascade is altered in EITL.</p>

            <p>For the determination of peripheral chronic stress markers, whole blood was collected into PAXgene Blood RNA tubes from nonstressed and chronically stressed Fisher-344 (F344), Brown Norway (BN-SS), Lewis (Lew) and WKY male rats of B100 days of age and of different litters (n ¼ 3 per strain per experimental condition). The chronically stressed animals were restrained in a breathable decapicone for 2 h per day for a 2-week period. Total RNA was isolated using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and then reverse transcribed followed by secondstrand cDNA synthesis. For each sample, an in vitro transcription reaction was carried out incorporating biotinylated nucleotides according to the manufacturer's protocol for Illumina Totalprep RNA amplification kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Then, 1.5 mg biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized onto RatRef-12 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego CA, USA) for 16 h at 55 1C. Post-hybridization staining and washing were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Illumina).

            <p>Determination of blood transcript levels of candidate markers. Blood was drawn on all participants, but the only samples sent to the Redei lab were those of youths suffering from current MDD or those without any disorder (ND). The Redei lab was blind to any information about the participants. Whole-blood RNA was isolated using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction; cDNA was prepared using random primers and the TaqMan RT reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Specific primers, listed in Supplementary Table S1, were designed to amplify the human ortholog of the rat microarray probe region of the candidate markers using the ABI's <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ca4217d433-software-28">Primer Express</rs> Software (version <rs corresp="#ca4217d433-software-28" resp="#annotator7" type="version">3.0</rs>, <rs corresp="#ca4217d433-software-28" resp="#curator" type="publisher">PE Applied Biosystems</rs>). qPCR was carried out using SYBR Green and the ABI 7900 (Applied Biosystems), with 18s rRNA as the internal control. 18s was chosen as the normalizing gene after an extensive comparative pilot study using several housekeeping genes (data not shown). Each sample for each transcript was measured in triplicate using 5 ng of template.</p>
            <p>Statistical analyses of human data. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample, and nonparametric statistics to analyze gene expression differences between the ND and MDD groups or between the MDD subgroups with and without comorbid anxiety disorders. Spearman's rho correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationships between the CTQ scores and gene expression levels. Because this is a pilot study, effect sizes are more informative than statistical significance. We calculated effect sizes for all differences between means, using Hedges' because of small sample and unequal subgroup sizes. Correlation coefficients themselves can serve as estimates of effect sizes, and hence we report rho values for these analyses. We made an a priori decision to interpret an effect size of X0.50 as clinically significant, which corresponds to Cohen's medium effect size. <ref type="bibr">45</ref> We did not control for multiple comparisons, as the goal of a pilot study is to detect as many potentially clinically significant relationships as possible.

            <p>Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional ethical committee for biomedical sciences at the National Institute of Unani Medicine (NIUM), Bangalore. There were 54 enrolled patients. Of the fourteen cases who could not complete the study, one patient of the placebo group died without any known immediate cause.

            <p>The symmetric differences were evaluated using the '<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-0">treedist</rs>' program that is contained in the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-1">PHYLIP package</rs> (<rs corresp="#b21a123b09-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="url">http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip.html</rs>). The benchmark tree that was constructed using the same dataset from the work of Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>, in which they concatenated the alignments of the 2034 core genes of the Escherichia/Shigella 26 genomes and used the maximum likelihood method to infer the phylogenetic relationships.</p>
            <p>The 16S rDNA tree was generated as follows. For each organism, we first retrieved its 16S rDNA sequence using the 'Browsers' on the Ribosomal Database Project (http://rdp .cme.msu.edu/index.jsp) website, and then created MSA of these 16S rDNAs and built a tree using the '<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-3">Tree Builder</rs>' tools (<rs corresp="#b21a123b09-software-3" resp="#annotator3" type="url">http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/treebuilderpub/index.jsp</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>.</p>
            <p>When the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-5">co-phylog</rs> method was applied to a real NGS dataset, L(S)-tuple with a minimum base quality under the threshold F were filtered (see the algorithm section). A dilemma in choosing the F value was that too small of an F might allow too many L(S)-tuple with 'wrong' objects past the filtering and therefore enlarge the deviation of the co-distance computed, while too large of an F might filter too much genomic information. We therefore explored the proper value range of F using simulated NGS data with sequencing qualities, which were generated using the tool '<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-6">Maq simulation</rs>' in the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-6">MAQ package</rs> (<rs corresp="#b21a123b09-software-6" resp="#curator" type="url">http://maq.sourceforge.net</rs>/). MAQ NGS data (distinguished from the perfect NGS data, using genome B. abortus 2308) of different depths were generated and different F values were tested on these MAQ NGS data; the proper range of F values were determined according to the co-distance d co (G 0 , G) between the MAQ NGS data G 0 and the complete genome G and the proportion q of genomic information taken by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-9">co-phylog</rs>.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-10">co-phylog</rs> (S = C 9,9 O 1 , qualities control threshold F = 10) tree constructed using the NGS raw dataset of the 29 E. coli organisms is almost identical to the tree built using the corresponding assembled genomes <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). Given the accuracy of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-11">co-phylog</rs> method based on assembled genomes has been proved previously, this test illustrates that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-12">co-phylog</rs> could be used in the phylogenetic analysis of unassembled NGS data. And as these NGS raw data came from all three popular sequencing platforms (454, Illumina and SOLID) (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S1)</ref>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-13">co-phylog</rs> is robust to the choice of sequencing platforms. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-14">co-phylog</rs> tree (using S = C 12,12 O 1 , according to Supplementary Equation (S2) and F = 10) constructed on the NGS dataset from the five large diploid organisms matched well with the known taxonomy (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S3)</ref>, illustrating that the tool <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-15">co-phylog</rs> can handle large size analyses and the complication of diploidy.</p>
            <p>The time and memory consumption of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-16">co-phylog</rs> program (coded in C) were tested on a platform equipped with Intel Xeon X5650 2.67 GHz cpu (only one cpu was used for this test) and <rs corresp="#b21a123b09-software-7" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SUSE</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-7">Linux Enterprise Server</rs> <rs corresp="#b21a123b09-software-7" resp="#curator" type="version">10 SP2</rs> (Â86_64).

For the five mammalian organisms, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b21a123b09-software-simple-21">co-phylog</rs> took 60G memory and 20 h completing the whole computing, including 17 h converting all NGS data into corresponding context-object sets and 3 h computing all pairwise co-distances.</p>

            <p>). Both constructs were generously provided by Dr Richard G Pestell, Department of Oncology, Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA. A dual-luciferase reporter assay (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to detect promoter activity in this study. A synthetic renilla luciferase reporter plasmid Phrl-SV40 (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a control for transfection efficiency. Panc-1 cells expressing different MUC1 constructs were cultured in DMEM plus 5% fetal bovine serum, and 10 000 cells/well were seeded into a 48-well plate and grown to B95% confluence. Each well was washed twice with PBS and transfected with 300 or 600 ng plasmid DNA using 2 ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen) in 200 ml Optimem (Life Technologies), respectively. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS, fed with 3 ml DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured for another 2 days. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and harvested with 200 ml Passive Lysis buffer (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific). To detect firefly luciferase activity (from pA3 plasmids with cyclin D1 promoter), 20 ml of each lysate was reacted with 100 ml LARII buffer (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on ice. Relative light emission was detected using an Optocomp1 luminometer (MGM Instruments Inc, Hamden, CT, USA) reading 10 s with a 2-s delay. Subsequently, to detect the renilla luciferase activity (from SV-40 plasmids as transfection efficiency control), 100 ml Stop&amp;Glo Reagent (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added into each well. The solution was vortexed for five seconds, and read again with the Optocomp1 luminometer. Light emission data (mean of triplicates) were presented as relative lumenescence units for each cell line and analyzed for statistical significance using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b50189acd8-software-0">Prism</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b50189acd8-software-1">InStat</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b50189acd8-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GraphPad Software, Inc</rs>., La Jolla, CA, USA).

Query coverage (Qcov) is the ratio of length of the match by length of the query sequence. This value indicates the part of the query sequence covered by the alignment. Similarly, Subject coverage (Scov) was calculated as the ratio of length of the match by length of the subject or target length, and indicates the part of the subject or target sequence covered by the alignment.</p>

            <p>Building on previous findings involving a skin explant culture assay <ref type="bibr">(Wong and Coulombe, 2003)</ref>, we find that K6 / skin keratinocytes in primary culture show enhanced migration after scratch wounding <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1 A)</ref> and in transwell migration assays <ref type="figure">Fig. S1 A)</ref>. Therefore, this phenotype is very robust and represents an intrinsic property of K6 / keratinocytes. The intracellular organization of keratin filaments appears normal in the absence of K6 <ref type="figure">Fig. S1 B)</ref>. The 4G10 antibody used in our previous study <ref type="bibr">(Wong and Coulombe, 2003)</ref> reacts with in vitro activated Src and immunoprecipitates Src and FAK from mouse skin keratinocytes (in a complex and/or individually; see <ref type="bibr">Fig. S1, C and D)</ref>. Collectively, the cell-autonomous enhancement in migration potential, the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 60-kD protein, and the largely intact organization <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Loss of K6 leads to SFK activation in woundinduced keratinocytes. (A) Migration of keratinocytes in scratch wounds. Distance and surface area of keratinocyte outgrowth were assessed by K17 staining (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-simple-0">ImageJ</rs>). Dashed lines depict the wound margin. The arrow shows the direction of migration. Data (mean ± SEM) are fold change relative to WT. *, P &lt; 0.001; **, P &lt; 0.01. n = 3 independent sample pairs. Bar, 20 µm. (B) Western blot analysis of Src/SFK activity in K6 / , K14 / , and K17 / skin explant keratinocyte protein lysates. Loading was assessed via actin (digitonin-soluble fractions) or caveolin (triton-soluble fractions). Blots were performed at least three times from independent lysates. Migration of standards is given in kilodaltons. (C) Subcellular localization of activated Src/SFKs in WT or K6 / keratinocytes in primary culture. Bar, 25 µm.

            <p>McGowan and <ref type="bibr">Coulombe, 1998; Takahashi et al., 1998)</ref>. By immunostaining, activated Src occurs in K6-expressing epidermal keratinocytes, both in cells actively migrating into the wound bed <ref type="figure">Fig. S2 B</ref>) or located behind the migrating front (not depicted), in wounded WT mouse skin. Activated Src shows a distinct staining pattern in many infiltrating, actively migrating keratinocytes that conveys its membrane proximity <ref type="figure">Fig. S2 C, arrows)</ref>. Together, our ex vivo and in vivo findings on SFKs and key Src substrates with a defined role in cell motility strongly suggest that the migratory phenotype occurring in K6 / keratinocytes involves an increase in Src activity. Immunostaining also shows that activated Src is concentrated at focal adhesions in keratinocyte cultures from both genotypes, as inferred from comparing its localization with that of vinculin at the outer edge of cells <ref type="figure">(</ref>/ keratinocytes. IgG, normal rabbit IgG; Pre-I, K17 preimmune serum. (B) In vitro cosedimentation assays. p-Y416 Src, in vitro activated Src; P, pellet; S, supernatant.

(F) Western blot analysis of Src activation and K6 induction in protein lysates of WT mouse ears treated with acetone (-) or TPA (250 ng/µl). Phospho-ERK 1/2 (p-ERK 1/2) was used as a positive control for TPA response; K5 and caveolin are loading controls. (G) Coimmunoprecipitation of Src and keratin from TPA-treated mouse ear (IgG). In all instances, similar results were achieved from at least three independent experiments. Migration of mass standards is given in kilodaltons. <ref type="bibr">et al., 1988)</ref>, and this could account for its greater affinity for type II keratins.</p>
            <p>Cell migration is a highly spatially organized process <ref type="bibr">(Martin, 1997)</ref>, raising the prospect that the keratin-Src interaction may be segregated to a specialized subcellular compartment at or near the membrane. We focused on detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) as a location of interest as a result of its established role as a key site of Src regulation <ref type="bibr">(Oneyama et al., 2008)</ref>. Upon activation, Src is recruited to cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (which are resistant to Triton X-100 extraction), where it phosphorylates C-terminal Src kinase (CSK)-binding protein (CBP; <ref type="bibr">Kawabuchi et al., 2000)</ref>. CSK is then recruited and inactivates Src via phosphorylation of its C-terminal tail <ref type="bibr">(Oneyama et al., 2008)</ref>. Keratin <ref type="bibr">(Caruso and Stemmer, 2011)</ref> and vimentin <ref type="bibr">(Berg et al., 2009</ref>) IF proteins have been found in DRMs. Likewise, we identified a fraction of the keratin pool, including K5, K6 <ref type="figure">Fig. 4, A and B</ref>), K14, and K17 (not depicted) as well as Src itself <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4 C)</ref>, in DRM fractions from WT skin explant lysates. In contrast, lysates from K6 / keratinocytes showed reduced levels of keratin and Src in DRMs <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4</ref>, A-C). Two phosphorylated forms of Src also localized to DRM fractions in both WT and K6 / explant lysate <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4 D)</ref>. Consistent with Confocal microscopy was used to relate the distribution of endogenous Src and transfected GFP-tagged keratin in nonmigrating WT keratinocytes in conventional primary culture. Both proteins showed a broad, pan-cytoplasmic distribution and partially colocalized <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2 E)</ref>. Coimmunoprecipitation of Src and keratin from WT skin wounds in situ proved difficult as a result of the relatively small amount of activated K6/K17-expressing keratinocytes compared with other cell types (e.g., inflammatory cells and dermal fibroblasts), cellular debris, and the protein-rich scab. As an alternative, we used TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) treatment of mouse ear to induce both K6 expression and Src activation in epidermis <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 2 F; Xian et al., 1997)</ref>. Keratins coimmunoprecipitated with Src in this context <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2 G)</ref>. These data establish that Src directly binds keratins and that K6, in particular, shows a consistently higher affinity for Src kinase whether it is active or not. Next, we set out to map the determinants mediating Src binding to keratins. Src comprises three major domains: SH3, SH2, and the CD <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref> A; <ref type="bibr">Xu et al., 1997)</ref>. Src's CD interacts poorly with keratin filaments <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2, B and C)</ref>. In contrast, a His-GFP-Src N-terminal fusion comprising the SH3 and SH2 domains <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3 A)</ref> showed full binding to keratin IFs in cosedimentation assays <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3 B)</ref>. Upon further dissection, the SH2 domain (residues 149-254) mediated strong binding to keratin IFs in copelleting assays <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3 B)</ref> and exhibited a higher affinity for type II keratins in Far-Western blots <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3 C)</ref>. The SH3 domain did not bind keratin in either assay <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref>, B and C). Direct binding to Src's SH2 domain does not involve phosphorylated tyrosine residues on keratins, given their recombinant bacterial source, implying that it is mediated by a novel binding determinant. A motif homologous to type I keratins has been recognized in this specific region of Src (Tachibanaand His-GFP-SH3 fusions with K6/K17 filaments, detected using GFP antibody. P, pellet; S, supernatant. (C) Far-Western overlays using His-GFP-SH2 or His-GFP-SH3 as ligands, detected with GFP antibody. Ponceau staining shows loading for proteins tested. Vim, vimentin. (D) FL Src or Src CD was equilibrated with or without K6/K17 filaments before activation via ATP-dependent autophosphorylation (p-Y416 Src/SFK). Total Src (or CD) levels are shown for comparison. (E) Quantification of Src FL or Src CD sequestration by K6/K17 filaments. Values (mean ± SEM; <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-simple-2">ImageJ</rs>) are reported as activity ratio and calculated by relating band intensity for active Src/Src CD in the presence of K6/K17 to active Src/Src CD band intensity in the absence of K6/K17. *, P &lt; 0.01. In all instances, similar results were achieved from at least three independent experiments. Migration of mass standards is given in kilodaltons. <ref type="bibr">et al., 2006; Todorović et al., 2010)</ref>. Plakoglobin, in particular, is a known Src target <ref type="bibr">(Miravet et al., 2003)</ref> and reacts with the monoclonal antibody 4G10 (unpublished data). The molecular mass of plakoglobin (80 kD) corresponds to a tyrosinephosphorylated epitope that is elevated in lysates from migrating K6 / keratinocytes <ref type="bibr">(Wong and Coulombe, 2003)</ref>. Others have recently shown that plakoglobin and other desmosomal proteins are enriched in DRM fractions <ref type="bibr">(Delva et al., 2008; Brennan et al., 2011)</ref>, as we observed in WT and K6 / mouse keratinocytes (unpublished data). These findings raise the distinct possibility of plakoglobin's contribution, perhaps in conjunction with other keratin-binding proteins (e.g., plectin) to the recruitment of keratin proteins to lipid rafts and/or to regulation of Src in migrating keratinocytes.</p>
            <p>All samples were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS before immunostaining. Stained coverslips or slides were mounted in Tris-buffered Fluoro-Gel (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Src and GFP-K17 colocalization was imaged by confocal microscopy (at room temperature with an Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with the 510 META module; Carl Zeiss). Images were taken using the 63× objective (1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil objective), and acquisition was performed via <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-2">LSM</rs> <rs corresp="#f238d1fd7a-software-2" resp="#annotator5" type="version">510</rs> software (<rs corresp="#f238d1fd7a-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Carl Zeiss</rs>). Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) was used to image Src staining, and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 was used to enhance GFP signal (Invitrogen). p-Y416 Src and K6 staining in WT mouse wounds were imaged by confocal microscopy (Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with the 510 META module at room temperature). Images were taken using the 20× (0.75 NA Plan-Apochromat air) and 40× (1.3 NA Plan-NEOFLUAR oil) objectives, and acquisition was performed via <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-3">LSM</rs> <rs corresp="#f238d1fd7a-software-3" resp="#annotator5" type="version">510</rs> software. Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 was used in each case. Cell stains used to assess Src and focal adhesion protein localization were performed from WT and K6 / keratinocytes in primary culture seeded on fibronectin (EMD)-coated coverslips (final concentration of 10 µg/ml and diluted in 1× PBS). p-Y416 Src/SFK, vinculin, p-Y925 FAK, p-Y410 CAS, and p-Y118 paxillin immunostainings were imaged on a fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer.Z1; Carl Zeiss) at room temperature. Images were taken using the 63× objective (1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil objective) and acquired via <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-simple-8">AxioVision</rs> software with a camera (AxioCam MRm) and saved as raw data files (Carl Zeiss). Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 or 488 (Invitrogen) were used to image. Analysis of all images was performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-simple-9">ImageJ</rs> freeware.</p>
            <p>Culture of newborn mouse skin explants was performed as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Mazzalupo et al., 2002; Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot et al., 2004)</ref>. In brief, 4-mm punch biopsies were cultured in mouse keratinocyte (mKER) medium for 8 d. The tissue moiety (original punch) was removed, cellular outgrowths were collected into lysis buffer <ref type="bibr">(Wong and Coulombe, 2003)</ref>, and cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Osmanagic-Myers and Wiche, 2004)</ref>. Cells were incubated in the presence of 0.01% digitonin and spun down, and pellets were resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer. Quantitative outgrowth assays were performed under the same conditions using 2-mm punch biopsies, except that on day 3, explants were treated with mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h to irreversibly inhibit DNA replication and mitosis <ref type="bibr">(Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot et al., 2004)</ref> and then with (or without) PP2 (Life Technologies) at various concentrations. PP2 treatments continued from day 3 to day 6, at which point both punch and outgrowth were fixed and stained with Giemsa dye (Sigma-Aldrich). Stained outgrowths were scanned, and the outgrowth area was measured using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-4">ImageJ</rs> freeware (<rs corresp="#f238d1fd7a-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>), as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot et al., 2004)</ref>, by subtracting the area of the punch (square pixels) from the total area of punch and outgrowth (square pixels). Student's t test was applied to determine probability values.</p>
            <p>Newborn mouse skin keratinocytes were seeded for primary culture in twoor four-well chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and allowed to reach confluency as a monolayer (24 h after plating). Cells were then serum starved overnight. At 48 h of culture, monolayers were scratched with a P200 pipette tip, and the mKER medium was replaced. Keratinocytes were allowed to migrate for 24 h and then fixed in 4% PFA for analysis. Both WT and K6 / primary keratinocytes were imaged via K17 immunostaining <ref type="bibr">(Mazzalupo et al., 2002; Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot et al., 2004)</ref>. Area and distance of outgrowth were quantified using the freeware<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-simple-12">ImageJ</rs>. Area of outgrowth was computed as the area of initial wound minus the area of wound remaining at 24 h, whereas distance of outgrowth is the straight-line distance from the wound edge to the leading cell periphery along the line and was measured multiple times for every wound sample to correct for potential local differences in keratinocyte migration. Outgrowth was then expressed relative to WT values, and Student's t test analysis was used to calculate probability values.</p>
            <p>Src activity was quantified from Western blot signals using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-simple-13">ImageJ</rs> freeware to measure band intensity and normalize it to caveolin to adjust for loading. The final data for K6 / samples are reported relative to WT. Src activity was also quantified at the leading edge of keratinocytes in immunostained preparations using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-simple-14">ImageJ</rs>. The leading edge of WT or K6 / cells was traced in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-simple-15">ImageJ</rs> and quantified for mean pixel intensity and surface area. Values reported are a ratio of mean pixel intensity at the leading edge per area of leading edge. In cosedimentation assays in vitro involving reconstituted keratin filaments, the fraction of bound proteins (Src FL or Src CD) was quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f238d1fd7a-software-simple-16">ImageJ</rs> in a similar manner, except that signal intensity of pelleted Src was divided by total Src signal intensity (total found in supernatant and pellet fractions). Similarly, Src's activity status in this in vitro setting was quantitated in the same fashion, except that an activity ratio was obtained by relating the intensity of the phospho-Src signal in presence and absence of keratin filaments.</p>

Admission-specific predictors were analysed as level 1 variables, whilst level 2 included static patient factors. Hence, at level 2,patient-dependent mean values for disallowance were used in the statistical analyses. Competence and GAF F were expected to be predicted by other variables and were therefore modelled as intermediating variables. The standardized and unstandardized regression coefficients were reported as well as odds ratio values for the dichotomous disallowance variable. Robust maximum likelihood estimator was used to adjust for deviations from normal distributions. By a linear regression function, GAF F was regressed on GAF S, admission count, suicide risk and diagnosis variables. The GAF variables were originally continuous variables ranging from 0 to 100. Ahead of the multivariate analyses, the range in these variables was reduced by dividing by 10. Competence level was predicted by GAF F and GAF S, alcohol or drug intoxication, some diagnostic groups and cross-level interactions between gender and GAF scores. The main outcome variable, disallowance, was predicted by competence, GAF S, diagnostic group variables, suicide risk and alcohol or drug intoxication.</p>

            <p>Depending on the scope of coverage, databases are divided into large groups of multidisciplinary, specialised, and narrowspecialised ones. Most prestigious databases cover periodicals of global/international importance, while there are also regional and even country-based abstracting and/or citation-tracking platforms (for example, KoreaMed and Korean Medical Citation Index). Finally, there are databases requiring subscription and those free to all users. Many leading academic and research institutions worldwide secure paid access to subscription databases. The databases can also be accessed through digital search interfaces such as <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="de8beb58ed-software-simple-0">Ovid</rs> and <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="de8beb58ed-software-simple-1">EBSCO</rs>, and they can link the indexed items to the full-texts in digital search platforms (for example, Elsevier's ScienceDirect, Springer's SpringerLink, and Wiley Online Library) and free online libraries (for example, PubMed Central and SpringerOpen).</p>

            <p>For determination of protein concentration, dilutions of the generated samples were performed with placebo buffer on an analytical balance at room temperature. Weights of used sample aliquots and diluted samples were recorded with four decimal places. For each sample, three independent dilutions were performed and analyzed in a qualified UV spectrophotometer at 280 nm and 320 nm. After subtracting the absorbance of 320 nm, from the 280 nm absorbance, the protein concentration was calculated according to Lambert-Beer law using the dilution factors and averaging the concentrations obtained from the three independent dilutions per sample. Concentrations were reported with two decimals. Furthermore, the following analytical methods were applied: Size-exclusion chromatography, non-gel sieving denaturing capillary electrophoresis (CE-SDS; non-reduced and reduced), capillary isoelectric focusing (CE-IEF), reversephase UPLC of released and labeled oligosaccharides, mAb1-specific SPR target binding assay and mAb1-specific qualified cell-based functional assay (the latter two assays were developed in-house). <ref type="bibr">38-44</ref> The five samples were comparable with regard to quality and physico-chemical properties by using the above mentioned analytical methods, e.g., very low aggregate content, unaltered charge distribution, identical oligosaccharide profiles, in vitro target binding and functionality (data not shown).C and the final mAb1/trypsin ratio »36:1 (w/w). For quenching, 20 mL 10% formic acid were added. The sample was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 5 min. An ACQUITY nanoUPLC (Waters) running in "high flow mode" followed by a Triversa Nanomate nanoESIsource (Advion) and coupled with a LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo) was used for sample analysis. Four ml of sample were loaded onto a ACQUITY UPLC column (BEH300 C18, 1.0 £ 150 mm, 1.7 mm) using a flow rate of 60 ml/min, a column temperature of 50 C and a gradient of 1 to 40% eluent B (0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile) in 130 min (eluent A: 0.1% formic acid). Data analysis was performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="ff090eaebf-software-0">XCalibur</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ff090eaebf-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Thermo</rs>). The extent of oxidation of a peptide was estimated in a relative manner to the unmodified peptide using this software.</p>
            <p>Serum levels of the five antibody samples were determined by a mAb1-antigen-captured electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using the ELECSYS e411 immunoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, serum samples, undiluted or pre-diluted with assay buffer, were incubated with capture and detection molecules for 9 min at 37 C. Biotinylated recombinant mAb1 antigen was used as capture molecule and a ruthenium(II) tris (bipyridyl) <ref type="bibr">3</ref> 2C (Ru[bpy] <ref type="bibr">3</ref> 2C ) labeled anti-Ab1-idiotype mouse monoclonal antibody was used for detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic microparticles were added and incubated for additional 9 min at 37 C to allow complex formation due to biotin-streptavidin interactions. Complexes are magnetically captured on an electrode and a chemiluminescent signal generated using the co-reactant tripropylamine (TPA) was measured by a photomultiplier detector. All serum samples and positive or negative control samples were analyzed in replicates and calibrated against reference standard. PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis, using the PK evaluation program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="ff090eaebf-software-2">WinNonlin</rs> TM (<rs corresp="#ff090eaebf-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Pharsight</rs>), version <rs corresp="#ff090eaebf-software-2" resp="#annotator3" type="version">5.2.1</rs>. Briefly, the area under the concentration/time curve AUC (0-672 h) was calculated by linear trapezoidal rule (with linear interpolation) from time 0 to infinity. The apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was derived from the equation: t 1/2 D ln2 / lz. Total body clearance (CL) was calculated as Dose/AUC. Statistically significant differences in the PK parameters between different mAb1 preparations were determined by ANOVA analysis.</p>

            <p>For monitoring the nuclear import of the ATF constructs, HeLa-SUMO cells were seeded on coverslips, grown for 24 h, before mounting in a Life Imaging Services Ludin Chamber kept at 378C, 5% CO 2 , placed in a Leica DMIRE2 microscope equipped with a Life Imaging Services temperature control system.

            <p>We hypothesized that we could suspect the degree of liver fibrosis by calculating liver enhancement heterogeneity in the HB phase, and accordingly, developed new <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="def9bb3aec-software-0">MATLAB</rs> (<rs corresp="#def9bb3aec-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">R2012a</rs>, <rs corresp="#def9bb3aec-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">MathWorks</rs>, Natick, MA, USA)-based software to identify inhomogeneous signal intensities calculated from a coefficient of variation (CV) map to objectively quantify liver parenchymal heterogeneity.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the heterogeneity of liver parenchyma on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR images, using CV value processed by our <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="def9bb3aec-software-simple-3">MATLAB-based software</rs>, and to demonstrate a correlation between the calculated heterogeneity and the calculated serologic markers including APRI and FIB-4, which have been known to have diagnostic accuracy for predicting hepatic fibrosis in CHB patients.</p>
            <p>To measure hepatic fibrosis quantitatively, we developed a <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="def9bb3aec-software-4">MATLAB</rs> (<rs corresp="#def9bb3aec-software-4" resp="#annotator2" type="version">R2012a</rs>, <rs corresp="#def9bb3aec-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">MathWorks</rs>, Natick, MA, USA)-based software to calculate a CV map, as suggested by Li et al. <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>. The following procedure was used to calculate the CV map: bias correction of intensity inhomogeneity, followed by calculation of the CV map by dividing the CV value by each pixel value in the circular region of interest (ROI; diameter = 40 pixels) and, finally, calculating the mean value on the CV map <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>.Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced axial images obtained during the HB phase MR image were obtained in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format and stored on console containing the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="def9bb3aec-software-simple-7">MATLAB</rs>-based program. For quantitative measurements of liver parenchymal heterogeneity, two abdominal radiologists (with 24 years of experience and with 4 years of experience in abdominal imaging), blinded to clinical information and pathological fibrosis grades, performed the procedure by positioning separate circular ROIs (diameter = 40 pixels) on the selected MR images, which was bias-corrected. In all subjects, ROIs were placed on the anterior segment of the right hepatic lobe with no overlap over large vessels and focal lesions such as cysts or tumors <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. Each radiologist measured ROIs 3 times in the selected MR images and calculated the mean.</p>
            <p>Optimal cut-off values were selected using a common optimization step that maximized the Youden index for predicting significant fibrosis; sensitivity and specificity were calculated from the same data without further adjustments. The inter-observer agreement was performed based on the intraclass correlation coefficient. The KruskalWallis test, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation coefficients, and intraclass correlation coefficient were conducted using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="def9bb3aec-software-10">SPSS</rs> version <rs corresp="#def9bb3aec-software-10" resp="#annotator2" type="version">18.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#def9bb3aec-software-10" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA) and ROC, sensitivity, and specificity were analyzed with MedCalc version 15.6 (MedCalc, Mariakerke, Belgium).</p>

It is important that the instrument is turned on at least one hour prior to sorting to warm up the lasers. Of note, when FAC sorting of ISCs is performed for the first time, the parameters for sorting and for compensation need to be set using the aforementioned controls: (1) dissociated cells from wild type (e.g.Of note, the advantage of using Sytox instead of propidium iodide to label dead cells is that there is only a low spillover into the FITC (GFP) channel, which makes it easy to compensate for the spillover.</p>

            <p>A collection of 248 B. napus accessions was used for association mapping (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S1</ref> <ref type="bibr">2008 and 2009, respectively)</ref>. Under these growth conditions, in central China both semi-winter and winter types are generally sufficiently vernalized to flower after winter. Spring type accessions grown under these conditions do not usually start flowering before the onset of winter. During the winter months, plant growth slows down or comes to a halt, but the relatively mild winter temperatures at the chosen location in central China generally allows the spring types to survive as well. Flowering time in both field trials was recorded as the days from sowing to the date when the first flower had opened on half of the plants of an accession. Furthermore, accessions were classified as spring, semi-winter or winter types according to the annotation of the original cultivars (Chinese Crop Germplasm Information System (CGRIS), http://icgr.caas.net.cn/cgris_english.html) or their general performance in the field (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S</ref> <ref type="bibr">(Sambrook et al., 1989)</ref>. DNA of positive BAC clones was extracted using the NucleoBondÒ PC 500 plasmid DNA purification kit (Macherey &amp; Nagel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Dü ren, Germany). Sequence identity or homology to the probe fragment was confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of BAC DNA using primer pair A102-A103.

            <p>SNP detection and inference of haplotypes in a collection of B. napus accessions According to the flowering time data of 248 accessions from two growth seasons (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S1</ref> at JXB online), a subset of 95 accessions including similar numbers of early, intermediate, and late flowering accessions were selected for a first genotypic analysis. The BnaA.FRI.a-specific primer combinations N036-A385 and N053-N020 were used to genotype these accessions by PCR amplification and sequencing. Two primers (N018 and A385) were used for sequencing the N036-A385 PCR products, and three primers (N020, N054, and N057) were used for sequencing the N053-N020 products. Whole gene sequences were obtained by assembling the sequence data from these sequencing reactions for each accession. Sequences were aligned using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-9">VectorNTI</rs> <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-9" resp="#annotator5" type="version">10.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Invitrogen Corporation</rs>, Carlsbad, USA) or<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-10">CLC main workbench</rs> <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-10" resp="#annotator5" type="version">5</rs> (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-10" resp="#curator" type="publisher">CLC bio</rs>, Aarhus, Denmark), and alignments were edited manually using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-11">BioEdit</rs> software (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-11" resp="#annotator5" type="url">http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html</rs>).

Three primers (N069, N076, and N078; see Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online) were designed to differentiate between the two nucleotides for each of the three haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) detected by HAP in haplotype block 2. All 248 accessions were genotyped at these htSNP positions by PCR with primer combinations N069-N020, N053-N076, and N053-N078. Haplotypes were scored according to the presence or absence of the respective bands after agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S1</ref> at JXB online).</p>
            <p>Population structure evaluation 28 publicly available SSR markers (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S3</ref> at JXB online) were selected from <ref type="bibr">Cheng et al. (2009)</ref> which were distributed equally across the genetic map of B. napus. To reduce costs, an M13-tailing PCR technique was used <ref type="bibr">(Schuelke, 2000)</ref>. For each SSR primer combination, the forward sequence of the M13 primer was added to the 5# end of the forward SSR primer and the reverse sequence of the M13 primer was added to the 5' end of the reverse SSR primer. PCR reactions were performed with four primers, the M13F-forward SSR primer, the M13Rreverse SSR primer, an IRD700-labelled M13F primer (MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany) and an unlabelled M13R primer. The 28 SSR markers were used to assay the 95 accessions which were selected for the first round of genotyping. The DNA analyser system Li-Cor 4300 (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) was used for electrophoresis and detection of PCR products. The presence or absence of PCR product bands was scored as 1 or 0, respectively.

Only SNPs with frequencies larger than 0.05 were included for LD calculation. To avoid redundancy, each InDel was considered as a single polymorphic site.</p>
            <p>For SNP/InDel-based association analysis, a structure-based model which takes population structure into account to reduce spurious associations was used. Associations between markers and the total trait variation were tested using a general linear model (GLM) which was implemented in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-16">TASSEL</rs> <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-16" resp="#annotator5" type="version">2.01</rs>.

The null hypothesis of this study was that the occurrence of polymorphisms in BnaA.FRI.a is independent of the variation in flowering time, whereas the alternative hypothesis was that polymorphisms are associated with flowering time variation. Only polymorphisms with frequencies above 0.05 were included and 1000 permutations were performed. An adjusted P value &lt;0.05 was considered as a criterion for association. For haplotype association analysis, block 1 and block 2 were regarded as two polymorphic loci. Different haplotypes in the same block were regarded as allelic variants at one locus. For further analysis of association between haplotype and flowering time variation in a larger panel which included 248 accessions, the software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-18">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-18" resp="#annotator5" type="version">9.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-18" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, North Carolina, USA) was used to conduct an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multi-comparison analyses with least significant differences (LSD).</p>
            <p>To determine the degree of LD within BnaA.FRI.a,<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-21">TASSEL</rs> <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-21" resp="#annotator5" type="version">2.01</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Bradbury et al., 2007)</ref> was used to calculate R 2 values for each pair of polymorphisms. Out of 780 pairs of polymorphic sites, 646 showed significant linkage with P &lt;0.05. LD decay for BnaA.FRI.a is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>A. For distances larger than approximately 2 kb, the R 2 value is lower than 0.2. This indicates that LD decays rapidly within this gene, suggesting that BnaA.FRI.a is suitable for an analysis of gene-trait associations.Population structure and impact on flowering time variation</p>
            <p>As there was no SNP with significant association to flowering time in both years, a haplotype-based association analysis was performed. Using the software <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-23">HAP</rs> (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-23" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// research.calit2.net/hap</rs>) to infer haplotypes for BnaA.FRI.a among all accessions, two haplotype blocks were found within this gene. 27 SNPs or InDels were located in block 1 (position -140 to 1223, including exon 1) and 13 SNPs or InDels in block 2 (position 1224 to 2182, including exons 2 and 3). Three common haplotypes (represented by more than two accessions each) were identified in block 1, while four common haplotypes were found in block 2. Three polymorphic sites <ref type="bibr">(InDel99, SNP282, and SNP348)</ref> in block 1 and three polymorphic sites <ref type="bibr">(SNP1224, SNP1615, and SNP1790)</ref> in block 2 were identified as haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) or InDels <ref type="table">(Table 4;</ref> Taking population structure into account, block 2 showed association with flowering time for both years (P &lt;0.05).</p>
            <p>Consistent with the phase relationships in the QTL population, the BnaA.FRI.a allele in the parental accession Ningyou7 corresponds to the earliest flowering haplotype 4, whereas the Tapidor allele corresponds to the latest flowering haplotype 3. Although there are several nonsynonymous SNPs within haplotype block 2, including the htSNP at position 1790 which shows a SNP-trait association in one year (P¼0.017 in 2008; <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) and could possibly affect protein function, the protein sequence in this region is identical between the two extreme haplotypes 3 and 4. However, the two haplotypes differ at two positions at the nucleotide sequence level, i.e. the htSNP at position 1615 and the SNP at position 1702, which are both located within the coding sequence. In addition to the SNPs observed between haplotypes 3 and 4, the two alleles in the TNDH population carry multiple additional polymorphisms, including several SNPs and a 3 bp indel in the promoter region, two indels in the 5# UTR and six nonsynonymous SNPs in exon 1 (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S1</ref> at JXB online). Among the six non-synonymous SNPs, two are located within the Frigida domain, but not at positions which are conserved among FRI family I proteins in A. thaliana and other rosid species <ref type="bibr">(Risk et al., 2010)</ref>, and two are located in the non-conserved region between the Frigida domain and the N-terminal putative coiled-coil domain. The remaining two non-synonymous SNPs are located within the N-terminal putative coiled-coil domain. One of these SNPs (SNP254) results in the substitution of a charged residue (glutamate) by an uncharged amino acid (glycine). Charged residues are present at high percentages in coiled-coil domains and are thought to stabilize the domain through electrostatic interactions <ref type="bibr">(McFarlane et al., 2009)</ref>. Interestingly, a glutamate to glycine substitution in the winter type allele in Tapidor (in an otherwise unchanged, theoretical molecule) would reduce the probability of a coiled-coil domain in the N-terminal region from ;50% to &lt;5%, and the probability of a coiled-coil domain in the semi-winter type allele in Ningyou7 is also low (&lt;10%; predictions according to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-55">COILS</rs> for a window size of 28 residues; <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-55" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/coils/ COILS_doc.html</rs>; data not shown). The glutamate residue is conserved between A. thaliana and the Tapidor allele and corresponds to the position with the most significant P value for SNP-trait association within the entire gene (0.005 in 2009; <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that the N-terminal region including the coiled-coil domain of FRI in A. thaliana is required for protein-protein interaction with FRL1 as part of a transcriptional activator complex which establishes an active chromatin state of FLC <ref type="bibr">(Choi et al., 2011)</ref>. It is conceivable that the polymorphism within the N-terminal coiled-coil domain in BnaA.FRI.a contributes to functional differences between the segregating alleles in the TNDH population and may also play a part in natural variation at least in some environments.</p>

            <p>Physicochemical properties of the TTLL12 wild-type and new 36AA plus isoform. The AA sequence of the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was obtained using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d5d281d4f9-software-simple-12">DNAStar EditSeq</rs> and translating the DNA sequences. Then, the AA sequence of the new isoform was aligned with the TTLL12 wild-type, and we found an additional 36AA inserted at the location of 281AA of the TTLL12 wild-type <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5A)</ref>. Next, we predicted the physicochemical properties by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d5d281d4f9-software-simple-13">ProtParam</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d5d281d4f9-software-simple-14">ProtScale</rs>. The properties of TTLL12 wild-type and 36AA plus isoform AA sequences were predicted <ref type="table">(Table I)</ref> as follows: the total number of negatively charged residues (Asp + Glu) was 93 and 96; and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAvY) was -0.390 and -0.338. In addition, the total hydropathicities of the two types of TTLL12 proteins are displayed in diagram <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5B and C)</ref>. These results suggest that the two types of TTLL12 proteins are hydropathical molecules, and the 36AA plus isoform is more stable than the wild-type.</p>
            <p>The additional 36AA is involved in a disordered region of TTLL12. To ascertain whether the additional 36AA in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform is in a disordered region of TTLL12, we firstly sought the disordered regions of the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform by the opening accessible online resources <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d5d281d4f9-software-simple-15">DisProt search</rs>, and found that the peptide of 260AA to 299AA in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was highly identical to the disordered region of Bcl-2-like protein 11 (B2L11) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7A)</ref>, suggesting this peptide could act as a disordered region in the <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the TTLL12 wild-type and new TTLL12 36AA plus isoform. The amino acid sequence of the new TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was aligned with the TTLL12 wild-type by <rs corresp="#d5d281d4f9-software-7" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NCBI</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d5d281d4f9-software-7">protein blast</rs>, and an additional 36 amino acid sequence was found (A). Hydropathicity of the wild-type (B) and the new 36AA plus isoform (C, red box indicates the inserted 36AA peptide) of TTLL12 was predicted by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d5d281d4f9-software-simple-18">ProtParam</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d5d281d4f9-software-simple-19">ProtScale</rs>, respectively. TTLL12 36AA plus isoform. As the additional 36AA are located between 281AA and 282AA in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform, we further explored whether the additional 36AA was in the disordered region of the protein. using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d5d281d4f9-software-simple-20">DisProt search</rs>, we found that the additional 36AA was partly identical to the disordered region of brain natriuretic peptide-32 (BNP-32) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7B)</ref>, giving the possibility that the 36AA could endow TTLL12 with new functions by acting as part of the disordered region. However, the biological functions of the new TTLL12 isoform in cancers remain to be further investigated.</p>

The animals were entrained on a 12-h-light (~200 lux fluorescent light)-12-h-dark cycle at least two weeks and then transferred to DD. Locomotor activity was detected with passive (pyroelectric) infra-red sensors (FA-05 F5B; Omron) <ref type="bibr">24,57</ref> and the data obtained were analysed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f8dfe17b2b-software-0">Clocklab</rs> software (<rs corresp="#f8dfe17b2b-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Actimetrics</rs>) developed on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f8dfe17b2b-software-1">MatLab</rs> (<rs corresp="#f8dfe17b2b-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Mathworks</rs>). Free-running period was determined with either a χ 2 periodogram or a linear regression line fit to the activity onsets. The data used for period measurements were based on animal behaviours in a 14-day interval taken 3 days after the start of DD condition. For the pulse-induced shift experiments, mice put in DD were exposed to a 15 min light pulse at either CT14 or CT22. Phase shifts (delay at CT14, advance at CT22) were quantified as the time difference between regression lines of activity onset before and after the light application.</p>
            <p>Per1-luc SCN slice culture. Per1-luc transgenic mice carry a firefly luciferase reporter gene linked to a 7.2 kb genomic DNA fragment covering the 5′ upstream region of the mouse Per1 gene <ref type="bibr">59</ref>. Per1-luc-Rgs16 -/-mice were generated by crossing Per1-luc transgenic mice and Rgs16 -/-mice. The SCN slices were prepared according to our standard method <ref type="bibr">6</ref> and kept at 35 °C in a sealed 35 mm petri dish with 1 ml of the culture medium containing 1 mM luciferin. The bioluminescence from the cultured SCN was measured with a highly sensitive cryogenic CCD camera (Spectra Video SV16KV/CT: Pixelvision) equipped with a microscope (Axiovert 135TV: Carl Zeiss). Observed data of images were filtered through a median filter to eliminate cosmic-ray-induced background noise. The luminescence was recorded every 20 min. Periods of SCN luminescence recordings were estimated using Fast Fourier Transform-Nonlinear Least Squares analysis <ref type="bibr">60</ref> as part of the<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f8dfe17b2b-software-simple-4">Biological Rhythms Analysis Software System (BRASS)</rs>. For all SCN to be compared, identical segments of raw SCN luminescence values, starting from the first trough since the start of the measurement, and containing at least four complete cycles, were analysed. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f8dfe17b2b-software-3">BRASS</rs> has been developed by <rs corresp="#f8dfe17b2b-software-3" resp="#curator" subtype="person" type="publisher">Dr Brown PE and co-workers</rs> and is available from <rs corresp="#f8dfe17b2b-software-3" resp="#annotator1" type="url">http://millar.bio.ed.ac.uk/Downloads.html</rs>. Intraventricular infusion of THFA. THFA (Tocris) was continuously delivered to the SCN via osmotic pump as described <ref type="bibr">29</ref>. In brief, the tip of the infusion cannula (Alzet, Brain Infusion Kit 2) was directed stereotaxically to the SCN and the osmotic pump (Alzet, pump model 1002) containing 100 mM THFA (118 µg/day, infused at 0.24 µl/h) was placed in a subcutaneous pouch by surgery under anaesthesia. We performed the surgery during the subjective daytime (CT8-10) when the phase of circadian clock is considered irresponsive to light. Following the surgery, animals were returned to their home cages and maintained in DD.</p>

            <p>The Restech pH probes were calibrated in pH 7 and pH 4 buffer solutions according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probe is a 1.5 mm diameter oropharyngeal catheter with a wireless digital transmitter worn externally. The catheter employs a 3.2 mm teardrop-like tip that contains a colored light emitting diode (LED) to aid insertion and to allow visualization of the sensor for proper positioning. The standard catheter was placed in the oropharynx at the level of the uvula. Each volunteer was asked to wear the device for a 24-hour period and was encouraged to participate in normal daily activities. Each subject carried one transmitter/receiver that wirelessly sent data to a monitor worn by the subject. The monitor contains a digital memory card to record events such as meal times, position and chief complaint. Once the pH study was completed, the volunteer returned to have the catheter removed, and the data from the digital recorder were downloaded to a password-protected computer. Data were analyzed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="a7386a8dc5-software-0">DataView</rs> software (version <rs corresp="#a7386a8dc5-software-0" resp="#annotator1" type="version">3</rs>; <rs corresp="#a7386a8dc5-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">AEMC Instru- ments</rs>, Dover, NH, USA).

            <p>The hippocampal neurons derived from E-18 pregnant SpragueDawley female rats were prepared as described. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> Briefly, the embryonic hippocampi were dissected, dissociated with papain and triturated with a polished, half-bore Pasteur pipette. Dissociated neurons (2.5 Â 10 5 ) in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.6% glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips in a 60 mm Petri dish. Four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B-27, 0.5 mM L-glutamine, to which 4 mM of 1-b-D-cytosine-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C, Sigma) was added as needed. Neurons were transfected using a modified calciumphosphate method. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Briefly, 6 mg of cDNA and 9.3 ml of 2 M CaCl 2 were mixed in distilled water to a total volume of 75 ml, and the same volume of 2X BBS was added. Neurobasal medium was completely replaced by transfection medium (minimum Eagle's medium, 1 mM pyruvate, 0.6% glucose, 10 mM glutamine and 10 mM N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid, pH 7.65), and the cDNA mixture was added to the neurons, and incubated in a 5% CO 2 incubator for 90 min. Neurons were washed twice with washing medium (minimum Eagle's medium, 1 mM pyruvate, 0.6% glucose, 10 mM glutamine and 10 mM N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid (N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid), pH 7.35) and then returned to the original culture medium. The vGlut-pHluorin (vGpH) and pU6mRFP constructs were cotransfected in a ratio of 5:1. The construct vGpH harbors vesicular glutamate transporter 1 fused with pHluorin, a modified GFP with high pH sensitivity. <ref type="bibr">43</ref> When targeted to the synaptic vesicle lumen, vGpH is quenched and upon exocytosis, the relatively basic pH of the extracellular space allows it to fluoresce. Its fluorescence is again quenched after endocytosis and re-acidification of the synaptic vesicles. Thus, this process accurately reflects the kinetics of exoendocytic trafficking of synaptic vesicles. <ref type="bibr">43,44</ref> Synaptic vesicle pool size measurement and image analysis Coverslips were mounted in a perfusion/stimulation chamber equipped with platinum-iridium field stimulus electrodes (EC-S-10, LCI, Seoul, Korea) on the stage of an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope with Â 40, 1.0 NA oil lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Neurons were continuously perfused at room temperature with Tyrode solution (136 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1.3mM MgCl 2 , 10mM N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.3). To reduce spontaneous activity and prevent recurrent excitation during stimulation, 10 mM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione and 50 mM of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid were added to the Tyrode solution. Time-lapse images were acquired every 5 s for 4 min using a back-illuminated Andor iXon 897 EMCCD camera (Andor Technologies, Belfast, Northern Ireland) driven by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="feda4c0427-software-0">MetaMorph Imaging</rs> software (<rs corresp="#feda4c0427-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). From the fourth frame, neurons were stimulated (1 ms, 20-50 V, bipolar) using an A310 Accupulser current stimulator (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) to mimic action potential generation. Quantitative measurement of fluorescence intensity at individual boutons was obtained by averaging a selected area of pixel intensities using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="feda4c0427-software-simple-2">MetaMorph</rs> software. Individual regions were selected by hand. Then, rectangular regions of interest were drawn around the synaptic boutons, and average intensities were calculated. Large puncta, typically representative of smaller synapse clusters, were rejected during the selection procedure. The center of intensity of each synapse was calculated to correct for any image shift over the course of the experiment. Fluorescence was expressed in intensity units that correspond to fluorescence values averaged over all pixels within the region of interest. Changes in net fluorescence were obtained by subtracting the average intensity of the first four frames (F 0 ) from the intensity of each frame (F t ) for individual boutons. They were then normalized to the maximum fluorescence intensity (F max ÀF 0 ) and averaged. For the exocytosis assays, neurons were preincubated with bafilomycin A1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) for 60 s to block re-acidification and stimulated for 30 s at 20 Hz/600 action potentials (APs), a combination, which is known to totally deplete the recycling pool of vesicles. <ref type="bibr">44</ref> Bafilomycin A1 was dissolved in Me 2 SO at 0.2 mM and diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 mM prior to the experiments. Bafilomycin A1 was applied throughout the fluorescence measurements.</p>

            <p>Postocclusive reactive hyperemia PORH was measured as described in Barwick et al. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Briefly, measurements were made with a moorVMS-LDF2 laser Doppler module and a VHP2 digit skin heater probe and needle probe (Moor Instruments, Axminster, UK). The laser probe was fixed to the plantar surface of the participant's hallux and heated to a thermoneutral 33°C. Where access to the right hallux was precluded by injury or amputation, the left hallux was used. A 2.5 cm pneumatic cuff (Moor Instruments) was placed proximal to the probe. The followingautomated settings were used with the moorVMS-PRES pressure module (Moor Instruments): 3 min of baseline flux recording, inflation of the cuff to 220 mm Hg for 3 min, cuff deflation at maximum speed, and postocclusive flux recording for a further 4 min. All data were processed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="c322bfae0c-software-0">moorVMS</rs> recording and analysis software V.<rs corresp="#c322bfae0c-software-0" resp="#annotator12" type="version">3.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#c322bfae0c-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Moor Instruments</rs>).</p>
            <p>The variables of peak expressed as a percentage of baseline (P%BL) and time to peak (TtP) were chosen due to their representation of the magnitude and temporal representation of the response and their established reliability. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Cardiac autonomic function assessment A Polar RS800cx heart monitor (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) was used to assess heart rate variability (HRV) as a measure of cardiac autonomic function. Participants completed a supine 5 min rest recording. The R-R interval tachogram was analyzed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="c322bfae0c-software-1">Kubios HRV</rs> software (V.<rs corresp="#c322bfae0c-software-1" resp="#annotator12" type="version">2.1</rs>, Kuopio, 2012). Ectopic beats were removed using linear interpolation of previous and subsequent beats. Time and frequency domain parameters were assessed. Time domain measured included the SD of the N-N interval (SDNN) and the root mean square of the R-R intervals (RMS-SD). Frequency domain measures were divided by spectral power analysis into high (0.15-0.40 Hz), low (0.04-0.15 Hz), and very lowfrequency (0.00-0.04 Hz) powers with total power calculated as the sum of all powers. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Variables were left continuous due to a lack of cut-off values established to indicate pathology.</p>
            <p>Statistical analysis was performed in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="c322bfae0c-software-2">Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences</rs> V.<rs corresp="#c322bfae0c-software-2" resp="#annotator12" type="version">22</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#c322bfae0c-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS</rs>, Chicago, USA). Reliability of sensory neuropathy diagnosis was assessed with duplicate tests on a subset of 31 participants 7-14 days apart. κ Statistics were calculated and interpreted as per Landis and Koch 21 ≥0.75=excellent agreement, 0.4-0.75=fair to good agreement, and &lt;0.40=poor agreement. Reliability of continuous measures (HRV) was assessed with duplicate tests on a subset of 29 participants 7-14 days apart. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated and interpreted in accordance with Portney and Watkins: &gt;0.75=good, 0.50-0.75=moderate, and &lt;0.50=poor. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Several hierarchical regression models were performed to determine how much the presence of sensory neuropathy and HRV predicted the variance in PORH variables (P%BL and TtP). One model for each of the four neurological variables ( presence of sensory neuropathy, RMS-SD, SDNN, and total power) was assessed. In each of the models, demographic variables identified as confounds (diabetes duration, gender, and age) were entered in level 1 and the neurological variable as the independent predictor variable in level 2. Non-normally distributed data were log transformed.</p>

            <p>In the present study, we investigated the taxonomic distribution of DEG7-like proteases and analysed how the unusual domain arrangement affects the oligomerization of DEG7 from A. thaliana. We demonstrated that DEG7 orthologues are restricted to fungi and plants, including various algae and land plants. Using Y2H assays and SEC (size-exclusion chromatography) with recombinant DEG7 purified from E. coli, we show that trimerization of DEG7 monomers is mediated by the second (degenerated) protease domain. <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref> <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref> <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>DegP and DEG1 from A. thaliana, representing the best examined Deg/HtrA proteases from animals, bacteria and plants respectively, were chosen as outgroups, since they do not belong to the DEG7 group <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.

            <p>We searched freely available genome databases for genes encoding DEG7-like proteases and retrieved hits for fungi and plant (including green, heterokont and haptophyte algae) genomes. All DEG7 orthologues share the unusual domain arrangement with two protease domains and up to four PDZ domains <ref type="bibr">[2,4]</ref> <ref type="figure">Figure S</ref>3 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/435/bj4350167add.htm for sequence alignment data) confirmed the close evolutionary relationship of DEG7 orthologues from various organisms <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Two main clades of DEG7 proteases can be distinguished: clade A contains DEG7 proteases from fungi, whereas DEG7 proteins from green, heterokont and haptophyte algae, mosses and higher plants form clade B. Whereas most species investigated possess only one DEG7-like gene, the genomes of the yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, the ascomycete Giberella zeae, the oomycete Phytophtora soja, the haptophyte alga Emiliania huxleyi and the moss Physcomitrella patens contain two, whereas the higher plant Populus trichocarpa possesses three DEG7 paralogues <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). Expressed sequence tag data from S. pombe, P. patens and P. trichocarpa indicate that all paralogues are expressed in these organisms (<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="b5ffa183ab-software-simple-4">TGI</rs>; results not shown), but whether they have overlapping/complementary physiological roles is still unknown.</p>

            <p>The quantification of the interaction between the Tao eta allele and knockdown of candidate genes was conducted in stage 9 egg chambers carrying asymmetric clones with respect to the anterior-posterior axis (see <ref type="figure">Fig. S4)</ref>. To assess the interaction, the apical-basal cell length of both Tao eta + RNAi and RNAi only (or wild-type control) cells was measured at the level of the nuclei using the confocal microscope (LSM 700) software or<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="bbf8603b9c-software-2">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#bbf8603b9c-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>). The apical-basal length proportion show no gross morphological defects in the PNS <ref type="bibr">(Silies and Klämbt, 2010)</ref>. Thus, although Fas2 down-regulation is critical for epithelial and PNS morphogenesis, both tissues can compensate for the complete loss of the protein. We propose that Fas2 helps to stabilize a morphological state and allows development to proceed only after its timely controlled endocytosis. This mechanism guarantees the correct timing of morphogenesis and thereby helps to coordinate the development of different cell types and tissues. In the follicular epithelium, Fas2 might collaborate with the zonula adherens in counteracting the pressure from the growing germline cyst. As a result, the cuboidal cell shape is stabilized and premature, and uncontrolled stretching is prevented. Subsequently, Fas2 internalization overcomes this control mechanism, and epithelial morphogenesis proceeds.</p>

The differences of count data between different groups were analyzed using chi-square test. Using pathological results as a gold standard, multivariate logistic regression analysis was done for parameters obtained in CEUS and quantitative parameters of TIC, and constant value (B), standard error (SE), Wald chi-square value, degrees of freedom (df), P-value (significant), and odds ratio value were calculated. Using the control group and the case group as dependent variables, the above parameters showing significances were processed by forward stepwise binary logistic analyses. After obtaining the logistic regression equation, the predictive value of each parameter was determined. The optimal threshold was set by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the survival time of patients was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the survival rates of patients were compared by the log-rank test. The relative risk of clinical parameters to the prognosis was evaluated by multivariate Cox regression analysis. The intergroup comparisons of count data were done using Pearson χ 2 or continuous calibration tests. A probability value of P,0.05 indicated that the difference was statistically significant.</p>

            <p>Immunostaining and microscopy Fixation with methanol or 3% PFA and permeabilization of cells were performed as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Balda et al., 1996; Matter and Balda, 2003a)</ref>. For the antibodies against active Cdc42 and Rac1 (NewEast Biosciences), cells were fixed in 3% PFA for 20 min at room temperature or methanol for 5 min at 20°C followed by a 3-min incubation in 0.3% Triton X-100 in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA, 10 mM glycine, and 0.1% sodium azide). The samples were then washed and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer. After blocking and incubation with primary antibodies, the samples were incubated with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies conjugated to either FITC, Cy3, or Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) in blocking buffer. In some experiments, fluorescent phalloidin was used <ref type="bibr">(FITC and TRITC [Sigma-Aldrich]</ref>; Alexa Fluor 647 [Molecular Probes]), and Hoechst 33258 was used to label DNA (Invitrogen). Matrigel-grown samples were fixed with PFA and then incubated with blocking buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS for 1 h. Antibody incubations were then also performed with the same detergent-containing blocking buffer. For tissue sections, colons were dissected from adult female MF1 mice that had been transcardially perfused with 4% PFA in PBS, in accordance with UK Home Office regulations, embedded in OCT compound (VWR International) and snap frozen. 5-µm sections were then taken using a cryostat. For immunofluorescence staining, the sections were permeabilized with acetone/methanol (33:67) for 10 min at 20°C and then transferred to methanol/DMSO (4:1) for 20 h at 4°C. The samples were then rehydrated with sequential changes of methanol decreasing from 75 to 50 and 25 to 0% in PBS at room temperature for 5-10 min each. Next, the samples were further permeabilized and blocked for 8-10 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber in BSA permeabilization buffer (3% BSA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.2% Na-dodecylsulfate, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 5% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich). The samples were then incubated with goat anti-SH3BP1 and rabbit anti-ZO-1 for 16 h at room temperature in BSA permeabilization buffer containing 5% donkey serum in a humidified chamber. Afterward, samples were washed with PBS and BSA permeabilization buffer sequentially for 10-15 min in two cycles.

            <p>The authors wish it to be known that in their opinion, the first two authors are the joint First Authors. human through the ASPIC algorithm <ref type="bibr">(12-14)</ref>. The alternative splicing pattern of human multi-exon genes, determined by ASPIC, has been collected in <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-0">ASPicDB</rs>, a database resource which presents some unique features with respect to other similar databases <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>. The ASPIC algorithm implements an optimization strategy that, performing a multiple alignment of all available transcript data (including full-length cDNA and EST sequences) to the relevant genome sequence, detects the set of introns that minimizes the number of splicing sites. It also generates through a directed-acyclic graph combinatorial procedure the minimal set of non-mergeable transcript isoforms compatible with the detected splicing events <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. The reliability of splicing isoforms detected by ASPIC has been recently established through a comparative assessment <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The annotation of the protein variants predicted with ASPIC is an essential step for exploring the functional and structural diversity of the proteins originating from the same gene by means of alternative splicing and therefore for unraveling the complex physiological effects of alternative splicing events <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>. Indeed, currently available databases, such as <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-1">ASD</rs> <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>, <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-20">ASAP</rs> <rs corresp="#c3db316586-software-20" resp="#annotator5" type="version">II</rs> (21),<rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-4">ASTALAVISTA</rs> <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref> and <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-5">H-DBAS</rs> (23), mostly collect information on alternative transcripts at the mRNA level, without considering the effect of alternative splicing on the protein structure and function. The <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-6">ProSAS</rs> (24) database contains structural information as derived from comparative modeling procedure, but due to the limitations of the modeling techniques, only $15% of the human transcripts are endowed with a reliable protein structure prediction.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-7">ASPICdb</rs> aims at filling the gap of structural and functional annotation of protein splicing variants, by adopting a set of analysis and prediction tools that do not rely only on annotation transfer by sequence similarity. It provides a thorough computational annotation of predicted human protein variants including PFAM domains <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>, N-terminal signal peptides, GPI-anchor propeptides, transmembrane domains, subcellular localization and other features, also reporting the relevant crosslinks to UniprotKB/Swissprot <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref> and PDB databases <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. A comprehensive annotation of the domain architecture and other structural features could also be extremely useful to critically assess the reliability of the functional classification provided the GO System <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>, which still neglects much of the relevant information for alternative splicing products.</p>
            <p>In addition, in consideration of the fragmented nature of the available transcript data, the new version of<rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-8">ASPicDB</rs> include the annotation of CAGE tags <ref type="bibr">(28)</ref> in order to identify truly transcription initiation sites and discriminate between full-length isoforms using alternative transcription initiations and 5 0 -partial transcripts for which a full-length CDS and the encoded protein cannot be reliably predicted.</p>
            <p>The computational pipeline implemented for supplementing the <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-9">ASPicDB</rs> protein sequences with functional and structural annotations is represented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> and integrates several state-of-the-art tools for similarity search and for machine-learning based prediction of protein features starting from residue sequence.</p>
            <p>For each one of the 256 939 protein variants coming from 17 191 human genes, a first layer of annotation consists in the retrieval of similar sequences from the two major repositories containing well-characterized proteins, namely: (i) the UniProtKB/SwissProt data base (26) (rel. 2010_07, June 2010), that contains 547 011 protein sequences with curated annotations, including 517 802 principal entries and 29 209 splicing variants (UniProt Consotium, 2010); (ii) <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-10">the Protein Data Bank</rs> (rel. July 2010), that contains resolved three dimensional structures for 50 171 different protein sequences <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Similarity searches were performed with <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-11">BLAST</rs> (30) setting the E-value threshold to 10 À3 . A second layer of annotation is obtained by mapping the structural and functional domains collected in thePFAM-A database (rel. 24.0, October 2009) that contains curated multiple sequence alignments based on hidden Markov models (HMM) for 8691 families, 2985 domains, 162 repeats and 74 motifs <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. The PFAM models were mapped on the <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-12">ASPicDB</rs> protein sequences by means of the pfam_scan.pl program (ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/ databases/Pfam/Tools/), based on <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-34">HMMER</rs> <rs corresp="#c3db316586-software-34" resp="#annotator5" type="version">3.0</rs> <ref type="bibr">(31)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The third layer of annotation results from the integration of several predictors based on machine learning tools, such as neural networks, hidden Markov models, support vector machines and conditional random fields. Since most of the methods take advantage of the evolutionary information encoded in sequence profiles, we compiled them starting from the similar sequences retrieved with two PSI-BLAST iterations (setting the E-value threshold to 10 À3 ) from the UniRef90 data set consisting of 6 955 504 sequences (July 2010). The first predicted features are the presence of N-terminal signal peptide and of C-terminal GPI-anchor propeptides, with SPEPlip (32) and PredGPI <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref>, respectively. Both the methods are among the best available predictors, scoring with accuracy as high as 95% the former and 88% the latter. When present, the signal peptide and the propeptide are cleaved from the protein sequence. The presence of coiled-coil domains is predicted with CCHMM-PROF that is able to locate coiled-coil segments in protein sequences with 80% accuracy <ref type="bibr">(34)</ref>. a-Helical transmembrane domains are then predicted with <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-15">ENSEMBLE</rs> <ref type="bibr">(35)</ref>, that discriminates transmembrane from globular proteins with false positive and false negative rates both equal to 3%. The same tool is adopted for predicting the number and the position of transmembrane segments along the sequence, with an accuracy of 90% on the protein base. The subcellular localization of globular proteins is predicted with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-16">BaCelLo</rs> (36), which discriminates four localizations in animals (secretory pathway, cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondrion) with 74% accuracy. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> reports some statistics on the data contained in the current version of <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-37">ASPicDB</rs> (version <rs corresp="#c3db316586-software-37" resp="#annotator5" type="version">2.0</rs>, <rs corresp="#c3db316586-software-37" resp="#annotator5" type="version">August 2010</rs>) which refers only to human multi-exon genes annotated in NCBI Entrez Gene (37) with at least one RefSeq transcript <ref type="bibr">(38)</ref> and the relevant Unigene cluster <ref type="bibr">(39)</ref> collecting all available gene-specific cDNA and EST sequences.</p>
            <p>In the current version of <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-20">ASPicDB</rs> some more features are available including the annotation of the CAGE tags (28) which define truly transcription initiation sites and a comprehensive protein annotation. A total of 12 789 394 CAGE tags have been mapped thus supporting constitutive or alternative transcription start sites. To each transcript variant a 'unique identifier' <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref> has been associated in order to make possible the unambiguous comparison with alternative transcripts collected in other databases.</p>
            <p>All alternative proteins collected in <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-21">ASPicDB</rs> have been compared with UniprotKB/SwissProt <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref> and PDB <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> databases. The results of similarity searches are reported in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Only 17% of the <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-22">ASPicDB</rs> protein sequences are identical to proteins deposited in UniProtKB/ SwissProt database. However, 94% of the sequences share significant similarity with proteins annotated in the same database, prompting the possibility of a reliable annotation transfer. Moreover, 54% of <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-23">ASPicDB</rs> sequences are similar to proteins deposited in the PDB suggesting that their structures can be modeled, at least partially.</p>
            <p>A considerable amount of PFAM models map on the<rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-24">ASPicDB</rs> sequences <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. On the overall, 71% of sequences match with at least one model. This result is in agreement with the reported sequence coverage on the human proteome of the current PFAM release, which is equal to 72.5% (25). It is worth noticing that, although all the models map with an E-value &lt; 10 À5 , only 20% of the matches are complete (that is, involve the whole model). A note of caution is necessary when inferring features from partial matches and the actual extent of the match has to be evaluated for each instance. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> summarizes the results of the annotation process performed with machine learning based predictors. Two percent of proteins were not predicted since they are shorter than 50 residues, 16% of proteins are predicted as transmembrane and 82% are predicted as globular. Among the globular proteins, 12% are predicted as secreted, 35% as cytoplasmic, 27% as globular and 8% as mitochondrial. Signal peptides and GPI-anchor propeptides are predicted in the 12 and 0.7% of theThe number of splicing sites belonging to the U2 or U12 class and of splicing events is also reported.</p>
            <p>sequences, respectively. Coiled-coil domains are predicted in 1.3% of the proteins. At the gene level, 30 and 92% of genes encode for transmembrane and globular proteins, respectively. Since the sum exceed 100%, it follows that 22% of the genes encode for both globular and transmembrane variants. The same consideration holds for the other annotations as reported in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. The amount of genes predicted to encode for proteins with different subcellular localization achieves 56%. This is partially explained by the fact that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-25">BaCelLo</rs> scores with an accuracy equal to 74%, which is the lowest among the methods included in the pipeline. Indeed the discrimination between the 'cytoplasmic' and the 'nuclear' classes is still a difficult task for all subcellular localization predictors <ref type="bibr">(40)</ref>. When the two classes are merged together, the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-26">BaCelLo</rs> accuracy increases up to 91%, but the rate of genes encoding for proteins with different localizations is still as high as 44%, suggesting that localization diversity is inherent in the <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-27">ASPicDB</rs> protein variants. The structure of PFAM annotations is also highly variable: 38% of genes encode for variants matching with different number and/or type of PFAM models. Altogether, results listed in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> suggest that alternative transcripts can encode for proteins endowed with different structural and functional features. <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-28">ASPicDB</rs> provides a unique resource reporting the annotation of alternative splicing variants at the protein level and an interface enabling the discovery of such differences.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-29">ASPicDB</rs> can be accessed though simple or advanced query forms. The simple query form allows the user to obtain the splicing pattern of one or more genes selected according to several criteria (e.g. HGNC name, RefSeq or Unigene accession IDs, etc.). The advanced query form allows the user to search for (i) genes, (ii) transcripts; (iii) exons; (iv) splicing sites; and (v) proteins, fulfilling different criteria (e.g. exons in a given length range, etc.). Depending on the choice separate query forms appear. The 'gene', 'transcript' and 'splicing sites' query forms have been described previously <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref> whereas the 'exon' and 'protein' query forms are novel features of this version of <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-30">ASPicDB</rs>. The exon query form allows the user to select exons in a given length range, belonging to a specific type (initial, internal or teminal), flanked by specific splicing sites or associated to one or more Affimetrix ExonArray probeset IDs. The 'protein' query form allows the retrieval of transcripts encoding proteins isoforms of a specific class (e.g. globular or transmembrane), subcellular localization (e.g. mitochondrion, nucleus, secretory, cytoplasm) or containing one or more features, including occurrence and number of PFAM or transmembrane domains, GPIanchor propeptides, signal peptides. Finally, it is also possible to retrieve genes encoding for alternative proteins that show differences in the above mentioned features.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c3db316586-software-simple-31">ASPicDB</rs> is an ongoing project and we plan to further develop it in the next releases. In particular we plan to add specific annotations on splicing regulatory elements and their interacting RNA-binding proteins located both in exonic and intronic regions. We also plan to update alternative splicing prediction by using the huge amount of RNA-Seq data which are now being produced by next generation sequencing, possibly annotating splicing events as constitutive or tissue-specific. Furthermore, literaturescreened splicing patterns related to diseases will be annotated as they represent potential molecular biomarkers and possible targets for therapy. Finally, the inclusion in the database of data related to other organisms will certainly favor a better understanding of the alternative splicing process through comparative analyses.</p>

            <p>Mice were euthanized 21 days after femoral artery ligation. At sacrifice, mice were sedated with an intraperitoneal injection of Nembutal 70 mg/kg. A midline sternotomy was performed to expose the heart, followed by insertion of a winged 25G needle (Mycroflex; Vygon, Ecouen, France) into the LV apex and removal of the right auriculum. Vessels were perfused by the LV cavity with 20 mL of saline, containing 100 IU/mL of unfractionated heparin, in order to remove the blood and prevent clotting. Tissue was subsequently fixed by a 15-mL perfusion with neutral buffered formalin 10%, followed by 20 mL of saline to wash out the fixative.

            <p>Upon inhibition of autophagy in HeLa cells, neosynthetized DRiP processing is delayed, thereby promoting accumulation of these potential antigens in large ubiquitin-positive aggregates, termed ALISs <ref type="bibr">(Wenger et al., 2012)</ref>, together with the autophagy adaptors p62/SQTM1 and Nbr1 <ref type="bibr">(Johansen and La- mark, 2011)</ref>. We examined the distribution of p62 and NBR1 by confocal microscopy in mDCs and found that the two adaptors <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The mTOR pathway is activated and autophagy is inhibited in DCs upon LPS exposure. (A) WT or MyD88-and TRIF-deficient (KO) DCs were stimulated with LPS as indicated, and S6 phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblot. (B) DCs were stimulated with LPS and treated or not with rapamycin (4 h) as indicated. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot for phosphorylation of p70-S6 kinase and S6 and total levels of p70, and S6 and actin served as controls (left). DCs were stimulated as indicated with LPS, and lysates were analyzed by immunoblot for phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46; middle) and AMB RA1 (right; P-AMB RA1 is indicated by an arrowhead). Note the shift of 4-EBP1 from the nonphosphorylated γ form to the partially phosphorylated (hypophosphorylated) β and the hyperphosphorylated α forms (middle). (C) DCs were stimulated with LPS for the indicated time, and CQ was added for 4 h where specified. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot for LC3 and actin (left). LC3I, nonlipidated form; LC3II, lipidated form. The relative LC3II accumulation was quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="c5c2ac2bdf-software-1">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#c5c2ac2bdf-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>; right). The data shown are from a single representative experiment out of seven repeats. (D) DC maturation induces autophagy inhibition. DCs were transfected with mRNA encoding for mCherry-GFP-LC3 and incubated for 8 h in the presence of LPS or bafilomycin or starved in HBSS. GFP and mCherry fluorescence in CD11c + cells was assessed by FACS (left). Plotted is the ratio of GFP fluorescence (fold over control) versus mCherry fluorescence (fold over control; right). Mean and SEM from three independent experiments and p-values (Student's t test) are shown. (E) Autophagy inhibition is revealed by accumulation of GFP-LC3. DCs from GFP-LC3 transgenic mice were treated or not for 4 or 20 h with LPS or for 4 h with CQ, stained for CD11c, and analyzed for GFP fluorescence (left). B6 WT DCs (histogram filled with gray) or GFP-LC3 DCs were stimulated (red) or not (green) with LPS for 20 h, and GFP fluorescence was analyzed in CD11c + cells by FACS (rightmost panel). The data shown are from a single representative experiment out of three repeats. Bars, 10 µm. accumulated in DAL ISs, together with LC3, polyubiquitinated proteins (FK2), and puromycin-tagged DRiPs (puro-DRiPs; <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> <ref type="bibr">Lelouard et al., 2004)</ref>. Autophagic flux inhibition in mDCs could therefore contribute to DRiP aggregation with p62 and LC3. Consistent with this hypothesis, the serine 403 phospho form of p62, which is increased upon autophagy inhibition and has enhanced affinity for polyubiquitinated proteins <ref type="bibr">(Matsumoto et al., 2011)</ref>, was found enriched in DAL ISs <ref type="figure">(Fig. S2 A)</ref>. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyl adenine (3-MA) strongly promoted DAL IS formation in mDCs, whereas autophagy induction with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin prevented p62 aggregation and DAL IS assembly <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2 B)</ref>. As DAL IS formation requires active protein synthesis, we demonstrated that although the mRNA translation was reduced by 3-MA and rapamycin treatment, the drugs did not interfere with LPS-dependent induction of protein synthesis, which remained active throughout the time of drug exposure <ref type="figure">Fig. 2 C)</ref>, further suggesting that, in addition to increased protein synthesis, autophagy inhibition is absolutely key for DAL IS formation. Polyubiquitinated protein aggregation and p62 expression have been linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) expression and NRF-2 activation <ref type="bibr">(Fujita et al., 2011)</ref>; however, treatment of DCs with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) did not prevent DAL IS formation in response to LPS <ref type="figure">Fig. S2 B</ref>), indicating that ROS production is not required for TLR-driven aggregation of DRiPs with p62 in DCs. p62/ Nbr1/ubiquitin-positive aggregates and DAL ISs are therefore identical structures, are also detectable in splenic CD11c + DC subtypes purified from LPS-injected mice <ref type="figure">Fig. S2 C)</ref>, and are the likely manifestation of a reduced autophagic processing of neosynthetized proteins.</p>
            <p>We initiated a comparative microarray-based genomic analysis of purified GM-CSF bm-CD11 + DCs differentiated or not in the presence of IL-4 to identify a transcriptional program capable of enhancing endosomes and/or autophagosomes dynamics. Principal component (PC) analysis (PCA) showed a close proximity of replicates <ref type="figure">Fig. 5 A)</ref> with a clear partitioning of each experimental condition tested. PC1, corresponding to ''LPS versus nonactivated (con),'' represented 49% of the overall variability between microarrays. PC2, corresponding to ''IL-4 treatment,'' accounted for 22%, suggesting that LPS activation dominated the overall DC differential gene expression program. However, IL-4 treatment induced a specific response only moderately affected by LPS. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected on statistical significance (P &lt; 0.1) and a fold change above 2 for up-regulated genes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5 B)</ref> and below 0.33 for down-regulated genes <ref type="figure">Fig. S5)</ref>. After clustering and heat map representation of the top regulated genes, resistin-like-α, Ccl24, and arginase 1 were found to be the most up-regulated by IL-4, as previously described in macrophages <ref type="bibr">(Van Dyken and Locksley, 2013)</ref>. Venn diagrams showed that out of all probes tested, 187 DEGs defined a core IL-4 differential gene expression signature <ref type="table">(Table S1</ref>). DEGs were submitted to two different pathway analyses, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="c5c2ac2bdf-software-simple-2">Voronto</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="c5c2ac2bdf-software-simple-3">Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)</rs> softwares. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="c5c2ac2bdf-software-simple-4">Voronto</rs> uses tessellation Voronoi diagrams to integrate expression data and hierarchical ontologies extracted from public databases <ref type="bibr">(Santamaría and Pierre, 2012)</ref>. The most significant pathways induced by IL-4 were linked to amino acid and lipid metabolisms as well as chemokine signaling. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="c5c2ac2bdf-software-simple-5">IPA</rs> identified the IL-4 signature list as constituted of immunologically relevant genes because top pathways were identified as inflammatory or immunological diseases. IL-4 was identified as the top predicted upstream regulator followed closely by IL-13 and STAT6, confirming the pertinence of our analysis. This prediction was mostly influenced by genes representing the hallmark of alternative versus classical macrophage activation, including Arginase 1 and anti-nematode and -fungal resistance genes such as chitinases (e.g., Chi3l4) and RNases (e.g., Ear11). When immunologically relevant genes were examined, mRNA levels of chemokines CCL24, CCL22, and IL-6 were all significantly GFP mRNA-transfected CB6F1 DCs were incubated with 0.3 µg/ml ovalbumin (delivered as immune complexes) alone or together with LPS or 3-MA for 8 h and used to stimulate DO.11 T cells. Mean and SEM from three independent experiments. (top right) CB6F1 DCs transfected for 8 h with eGFP or eGFP-SL8-OT2P mRNA were used to stimulate DO.11 T cells for 24 h. T cell activation was determined by IL-2 dosage. Mean and SEM from four experiments and p-values (Student's t test) are shown. (bottom) CB6F1 DCs were transfected with GFP or with GFP-2OP mRNA and cultured for 8 h in the presence or absence of 3-MA or LPS, and antigen expression (% GFP positive) and K b /SL8 surface appearance (% K b /SL8 positive by 25D1 staining) were measured. Mean and SEM from three independent experiments.augmented by IL-4, whereas levels of CD86 and CD40 were moderately up-regulated, as anticipated from cytometry <ref type="figure">Fig. S3)</ref>. As IL-4 shifts cellular resources away from the generation of molecules associated with proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide (NO) production, we extracted by Venn diagrams a list of 112 genes (common; <ref type="figure">Fig. S</ref>5 B) that were significantly down-regulated by IL-4 in all conditions tested. A majority of these DEGs belonged to immunological-relevant pathways (Fig. S5 C, yellow delineation), among which cytokines, cytokine receptors, and innate receptors were overrepresented. IL-1β and TNF, as well as TLR 1, 2, 6, and 7 and CD14 were down-modulated by IL-4 differentiation, confirming that IL-4 induces a bias in the capacity of DCs to sense microbes and promote inflammation. In agreement with these observations, upstream regulators of majorly IL-4-down-regulated genes included TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β.</p>

            <p>In particular, previously unpublished data from 2010 suggests that food sharing may require social bonds that require development over long periods of time. In Trinidad, we captured 5 females at 5 sites that were 20-90 km apart. We conducted 3 separate food-sharing experiments to see if these previously unfamiliar individuals would begin sharing food after being kept in captivity together for several weeks. To assess changes in allogrooming over time, we also conducted random focal sampling of allogrooming. We ranked the amount of time each bat spent grooming others, then tested whether the mean ranks across bats increased over time using a permutation test (<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="bd5d88a647-software-simple-0">lmPerm package</rs> in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="bd5d88a647-software-simple-1">R</rs>). We never observed food sharing, but we found that bats began begging others on the second and third sets of fasting trials on days 21 and 36 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). We also found that allogrooming increased over time among the previously unfamiliar bats [R 2 = 0.45, F(1,10) = 8.3, p = 0.018].</p>

            <p>The mRNA expression levels of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were determined by RT-PCR. Briefly, SK-N-SH cells were treated as mentioned above, and the total RNA of each group was extracted using TRIzol agent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA was first reverse transcribed into cDNA, and then routine PCR was performed as previously described <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control and products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c9e881799f-software-0">ImageJ</rs> software (<rs corresp="#c9e881799f-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NIH</rs>, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to quantify the optical density value of each band.

            <p>Western blot analysis. Cells were collected at 24 h after exposure to H 2 O 2 . In order to detect the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax, SK-N-SH cells were washed with PBS and lysed using a lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4˚C, and the supernatant was saved for the total protein determination. Protein concentrations were determined using a commercially available BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). For western blot analysis, equivalent amounts of protein of each sample (20 µg) were electrophoresed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). After the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature, primary antibodies (in TBST-5% BSA) against Bcl-2 (1:2,000; 12789-1-AP) and Bax (1:5,000; 60267-1-Ig) (both from ProteinTech Group Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) were added and incubated overnight at 4˚C for determining signal transduction events. The membranes were rinsed three times with TBST and incubated with an appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000; #04-15-06 and #04-18-06) (both from KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for 1 h at 37˚C.

            <p>Construct validity was determined by examining the gaps in the measurement of each item's calibration value. Z-test analysis was used to determine the significance of gaps. The presence of significant gaps indicates that some domains of the job satisfaction construct are not assessed. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> Reliability refers to the level of true and error variance in an observed score. The Rasch person reliability index denotes the reproducibility of person placement across other items measuring the same construct, which is equivalent to the Cronbach's alpha (test reliability) in classical test theory. <ref type="bibr">22,23,26</ref> An overall score of job satisfaction among community pharmacists in Tucson was calculated converting the ordinal responses from the WarrCook-Wall questionnaire to interval data (logits) with the Rasch Model if the Rasch model's requirements mentioned above were met. A higher score in logits represents greater job satisfaction (logits typically ranges from -4 to 4). The Rasch overall score was used as a continuous variable in descriptive, and non-parametric bivariate analyses to explore differences in job satisfaction and age, type of degree (PharmD/Non-PharmD), years of experience, workload (Avg. prescription volume/week, and whether they worked more than 36 hours/week), type of pharmacy chain (Grocery/non-grocery), having experience outside of community practice (yes/no), provision of patient care services at the pharmacy (yes/no) and job position (Pharmacist in charge yes/no) the selection of these variables was based on previous studies. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Statistical significance was set at 0.05.

Both NMR and LC-MS variables were subjected to Pareto scaling, by dividing each variable by the square root of its standard deviation. Data were visualized by means of principal component scores and loadings plots. Each point in the scores plot represents an individual biochemical profile of a sample, whereas on the loadings plot each coordinate represents a single NMR spectral region or LC-MS retention time and mass to charge ratio (m/z). Because the scores and loadings plots are complementary, biochemical components responsible for the differences between samples detected in the scores plot can be extracted from the corresponding loadings plot.</p>

            <p>Based on our former studies, we built two risk calculators in the training cohort (n = 1059) from 2006 to 2010. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Risk calculator 1 (RC1) was built according to the rules of a logistic regression model based on age, result of DRE, PV, logPSA (logarithm of PSA), %fPSA, and TRUS result. Risk calculator 2 (RC2) was built according to the rules of a logistic regression model based on age, result of DRE, logPSA (logarithm of PSA), and %fPSA. The dichotomous variables (TRUS and DRE results) were considered as 1 for positive and 0 for negative in the risk calculators. Then, we evaluated the performances of PSA, PCPT risk calculator, and Huashan RC1 and RC2 for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa in the training cohort, the validation cohort and their subgroups (e.g., population with PSA ranging from 2.0 ng ml −1 to 20.0 ng ml −1 and population with PSA ranging from 2.0 ng ml −1 to 10.0 ng ml <ref type="bibr">−1</ref>). In the current study, the PCPT risk calculation was performed using the available formula. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> PSA was also used as a reference prediction tool in our analysis. The high-grade PCa was defined as PCa with a Gleason Score ≥8 according to the Chinese Urological Association (CUA) guideline. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Evaluation of the PCPT risk calculator was excluded in high-grade PCa in the criteria for high-grade PCa in the CUA guidelines <ref type="bibr">12</ref> and EAU (European Association of Urology) guidelines. Since the epidemiological database was not well established in China, the risk factor of family history in PCPT risk calculator was ignored in the analysis. The baseline characteristics (age, prostate volume, logPSA, and %fPSA) between two cohorts were compared using t-test for continuous variables or Chi-squared test for categorical variables (DRE result, TRUS result, and PCa detection rate under 6-or 10-core). Z-test was performed to evaluate the differences among area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the two risk calculators, PCPT risk calculator and PSA. Two-sided test with P = 0.05 was used.

            <p>The functional impact on flowering-time regulation of the three conserved elements was tested in a promoter <ref type="bibr">FIG. 3</ref>. Continued iterations. Arabidopsis thaliana co-10 null mutant was complemented with cDNA of COL1, COL2, AeCO, AeCOL2, and ThCOL fused to 3xHA-tag expressed from pSUC2 (C) or pCO (D). Flowering time (mean total leaf number AE SD) was examined in independent homozygous transgenic lines (T 3 ) in LD conditions. Col-0, co-10, and homozygous pCO::3xHA:CO, pAeCO::3xHA:CO (from <ref type="figure">fig. 1C)</ref> and pSUC2::3xHA:CO lines are shown as controls. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in leaf number (*P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.001) compared with Col-0 (wt).To identify cis-element motifs associated with CO expression pattern, 6-10 bp motifs overrepresented in the ten Brassicaceae CO promoters were sought using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="be054aa80e-software-9">Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME)</rs> tool <ref type="bibr">(Bailey et al. 2009</ref>). The most enriched sequences (present 73 Â in the ten promoters) contain the E-Box (CANNTG, <ref type="figure">fig. 4D)</ref>, which is the binding site for FLOWERING BHLH (FBH) transcription factors that activate CO transcription in A. thaliana <ref type="bibr">(Ito et al. 2012)</ref>. The second most abundant motif (70Â) contains the extended DOF binding site (AAAGTG, <ref type="figure">fig. 4B)</ref> described earlier. The third motif identified (40Â) carries a core sequence (GGAC CA) that is bound by TCP transcription factors <ref type="bibr">(Schommer et al. 2008; fig. 4C)</ref> and is part of the CMM. In order to investigate whether the identified cis-elements represent a novelty in CO promoters, the abundance of these elements was determined in CO, COL1 and COL2 promoters (À4 kb) from five Brassicaceae as well as subgroup Ia COL genes from six non-Brassicaceae species <ref type="figure">fig. 4B-D)</ref>. Available mRNA data for these COL genes indicated that they showed an expression pattern similar to COL1/2 of A. thaliana <ref type="bibr">(Hecht et al. 2005, 2007; Bohlenius et al. 2006; Almada et al. 2009; Gonz alez- Schain et al. 2012; Hsu et al. 2012; Kloosterman et al. 2013)</ref>. CO promoters contained significantly more DOF and TCP binding sites compared with the COL gene promoters of Brassicaceae COL genes as well as those from other species and significantly more than the CO promoters shuffle control <ref type="figure">fig. 4B and C)</ref>. Additionally, the CO promoters contained more E-Boxes compared with the shuffle control and nonBrassicaceae. No significant difference in the expression levels of these mRNAs was detected, indicating that, in contrast to CO, the COL1 and COL2 genes are not regulated by CDFs. These data suggest that CDF regulation of CO is either a novelty that arose in the Brassicaceae or that it was present in the last common ancestor of CO, COL1 and COL2 but was lost in COL1 and COL2 during the process of subfunctionalization. Another indication that DOF regulation is a novelty associated with the CO gene came from further comparison of the cdf1235 mutant and wt (Col-0). In wt A. thaliana, CO mRNA levels are efficiently downregulated in the morning to ensure the gene is not transcribed when plants are exposed to light early in the day. The CDFs contribute to this repression of CO, because in the cdf1235 mutant CO mRNA levels are generally higher <ref type="bibr">(Fornara et al. 2009</ref>). However, if the cdf1235 mutant seedlings grown in LDs remain in darkness at subjective dawn, even higher CO mRNA levels are observed than if the plants are transferred to light <ref type="figure">fig. 6A)</ref>. This suggests that CO transcription is also repressed at dawn by a second mechanism that is independent of CDFs but dependent on light. This light-dependent mechanism is not detected in wt plants because it is overridden by CDF activity that strongly represses CO transcription. A similar effect of light is detected for ThCOL mRNA <ref type="figure">fig. 6B)</ref> <ref type="bibr">Ledger et al. 2001)</ref>. These data indicate that ThCOL, such as COL1 and COL2, is not repressed by CDF transcription factors at dawn but by exposure to light, and that this regulation can also be detected for the CO promoter if CDF activity is removed in the cdf1235 mutant.</p>

            <p>Matrix-free LDI MS detection and imaging. The lipid molecules were initially dissolved in chloroform and ethanol was used for AONB at a concentration of 1 mg/ mL and then diluted in a step wise manner. To perform to MS detection, typically 0.4 mL of the diluted solution was directly deposited on the paper or NALDI TM plate (Bruker Daltonics), for MS analysis on Bruker Autoflex TOF/TOF III Smartbeam. For the standard matrix assisted detection, 0.4 mL of sample solution was mixed with 1 mL of CHCA matrix (10 mg/mL, in acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid, 50549.950.1%, v/v/v) and dried on the commercial MALDI plate (MPT 384 plain steel) before MS analysis. All mass spectra were obtained in the RP-HPC-Proteomics mode via an accumulation of 500 laser shots under a laser intensity of 36% for data collection and calibrated using an auto calibration method. Two standard peptides, Angiotensin II (M.W. 1046.5) and ACTH-Clip (M.W. 2465.7), were used for calibration to reduce variability. No smoothing of spectra was applied. In the imaging experiments, the stamp with laser engraved letters pattern was first fabricated and immersed into a DOTAP solution at a concentration of 1 ng/mL. The stamp was pressed to the paper substrate separately and then the stamped paper was loaded into the MS chamber for imaging. Matrix-free mass spectrometry imaging was performed on the Bruker Autoflex TOF/TOF III mass analyzer system in positive reflector mode. In the imaging set up, the spot-to-spot distance was set to be 50 mm and 50 laser shots were taken with laser intensity of 36% at each spot. The nitrogen laser (337 nm) was applied at a repetition rate of 200 Hz. A full mass spectrum ranging from 200 to 2000 m/z was acquired for every pixel at an x-y step-size of 50 mm. Imaging data was stored in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fa732d76af-software-simple-0">FlexImaging</rs> data format (Bruker Bioscience). 2D image construction and statistical analysis were executed using custom-made scripts in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="fa732d76af-software-0">FlexImaging</rs> software (<rs corresp="#fa732d76af-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bruker Biosicence, AUS</rs>). Peak finding and integration was performed for each pixel to select peaks at specific m/z of 380 and 662. Peaks were integrated using a 0.3 Da window.</p>

            <p>Electronic data entry was performed by a single investigator and independently verified by a second study team member against hard copies of the original data collection forms. The MM was applied to the quality assured data as previously described. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The MUAC and HL measures for each child were rounded up or down to the nearest 1.0 cm and the corresponding fractional weight for each measurement obtained from the published table. The fractional weights were summed to generate an estimated weight for that participant. Data on age, height, and MUAC were used to estimate weight using 12 other weight estimation methods: Advanced Pediatric Life Support (APLS), Best Guess, Broselow, Leffler, Luscombe-Owens, Nelson, Shann, Theron, Traub-Johnson, and TraubKichen. <ref type="bibr">8-19</ref> The predicted weights as determined by each method were regressed against actual weights and the slope, the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the slope, the intercept, the 95% CI for the intercept, and the Pearson correlation coefficient were estimated. The percent agreement between estimated weight and actual weight was determined visually using Bland-Altman plots with log-transformation. Mean error (ME) was calculated by taking the difference of the predicted and actual weights. Mean percentage error (MPE) was calculated by dividing the actual weight into the ME and multiplying by 100. Root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated by taking the square root of the average squared error. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was determined using a 2-way random effects model and an absolute agreement definition to evaluate reliability between raters.

Gradient switching artifact was removed using average artifact subtraction, which uses the regularity of the gradient switching induced waveform to generate a moving average artifact that can be successfully removed from the baseline EEG <ref type="bibr">(Allen et al., 2000)</ref>. Cardioballistic artifact is commonly seen in routine scalp EEG recordings. It is greatly amplified when EEG is recorded in the MR environment because movement of electrically conductive material in a static field results in electromagnetic induction. In contrast, cardioballistic artifact is not seen in routine clinical intracranial EEG records, nor was it seen in our intracranial EEG recordings in the MR environment. Therefore, removal of this artifact was not necessary. The reason why this artifact is not seen in clinical intracranial EEG recordings or in our iEEG-fMRI recordings is that intracranial electrodes(depth or subdural electrodes) are less prone to movement with cardiac pulsations because they are fixed to the skull or dura. Additionally, the distance between the active and reference electrodes is smaller for iEEG than scalp EEG, which further reduces the amplitude of cardioballistic artifact.</p>

            <p>Since 2006, the Korean Movement Disorders Society (KMDS) has held annual nationwide campaigns and lectures regarding PD ("Red Tulip Campaign") to educate PD patients and caregivers in KMDS member hospitals. A survey of 1230 participants (PD patients and caregivers), organized by the KMDS, was performed at 44 sites from 48 secondary-or tertiary-referral hospitals in Korea from April 2, 2013 to June 14, 2013. No specific inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied, except that the patients were required to participate voluntarily and to be capable of answering the questionnaire. Trained interviewers collected demographic data from patients or caregivers and administered the 12-item questionnaire in face-to-face interviews with the participants at each site. Participants answered all questions with one of three answers (Yes, No, and Unknown). Demographic data included age, gender, PD duration, diagnosis of parkinsonianAcupuncture with bee venom for the treatment of Parkinson's disease has been proven safe 10 Acupuncture with bee venom for the treatment of Parkinson's disease has been proven efficacious <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Acupuncture with bee venom for the treatment of Parkinson's disease has been proven globally, and it is currently used as a standard therapy for Parkinson's disease <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Although acupuncture with bee venom for the treatment of Parkinson's disease is an experimental treatment without proof of safety and efficacy, I am willing to receive this experimental treatment if there is a chance JMD disorders, years of education, and the most disabling symptoms. Survey questionnaires developed by the executive committee of the KMDS was comprised of three parts <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The first section of the questionnaire (4 questions) was designed to estimate the participant's knowledge of the pathogenesis and the medical and surgical treatments available for PD. The second section (3 questions) covered the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapy, and whether stem cell therapy was used worldwide as an evidencebased practice. Questions in the final section were similar to those in the second section, except that the questions referred to bee venom acupuncture treatment rather than stem cell therapy. Two questions asked the participants whether they were willing to receive stem cell therapy or bee venom acupuncture treatment despite the fact that they were not safe, effective or acknowledged as a standard treatment around the world. For all questions, participants answered using the responses yes, no, or unknown. Other demographic data, such as age upon participation in the survey, gender, duration of PD, years of education, category of PD diagnosis and the most disabling symptom, were also collected in parallel. The categories of PD diagnosis comprised PD, Parkinson plus syndrome, and an unknown diagnostic parkinsonism category. The most disabling symptoms included tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability (falls), gait disturbance, and others. Statistical analyses were performed after converting participant responses into correct, incorrect, and unknown responses. The degree of accuracy of the understanding of PD between patients and caregivers was compared using chi-squared tests. Factors affecting an accurate understanding of PD treatment were analyzed using univariate logistic regression analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="c984335383-software-simple-0">SAS</rs> program.</p>

            <p>In addition to the illustration of associated cell types and organelles along with the measured peptides, generalinformation about the protein is provided: Besides protein descriptions and full protein sequences, the corresponding Gene Ontology identifiers <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref> are listed linking to the Gene Ontology web site reporting full descriptions of the selected annotation. Furthermore, the annotations to each instance include PubMed references and general features such as active sites, motifs, domains or signaling sites derived from SwissProt <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Since there may be several isoform entries corresponding to one SwissProt entry, we <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-0">BLASTP</rs>-aligned the protein sequence of each SwissProt instance with that of the corresponding entry of the database used for matching the spectra to peptide sequence (usually the IPI). The main purpose of this extensive alignment approach is to derive the exact sequence positions of relevant protein features that are annotated in SwissProt within the protein sequences of the entry of the database used for MS identification.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, each chromosome is divided into 93 bins: on the left hand side the number of transcripts annotated in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-1">EnsEMBL</rs> is displayed. Selecting one of the bin boxes pops up the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-2">EnsEMBL</rs> web page, showing a detailed view of the selected chromosome region. On the right hand side, the number of transcripts that have been detected in any of the uploaded projects is illustrated for each bin. Clicking on one of these bin buttons results in the listing of all identified gene transcripts along with the descriptions of the corresponding genes and exact localizations on the chromosome. Moreover, a link is provided for each gene transcript that connects to the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-3">EnsEMBL</rs> homepage displaying the full annotation of that transcript. In addition to the general annotation of the given gene transcript, the pop-up <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-4">EnsEMBL</rs> page will show all peptides that have been identified via the MAPU 2.0 DAS source <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. Thus, whenever a web user requests the information provided by MAPU 2.0 on <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-5">EnsEMBL</rs>, the data included in the MAPU 2.0 database are illustrated via the DAS/Proserver system <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>. Clicking on one of the illustrated peptides yields a report of all the cell types that contain the peptides for this gene transcript. In addition to the MAPU 2.0 DAS source, we have also established a PHOSIDA DAS source providing all phosphorylation sites that have been unambiguously identified (Class 1 sites) <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>, but also phosphosites that lack precise identification within the phosphorylated peptide sequence due to insufficient fragment information in MS/MS (ambiguous sites).</p>

            <p>Participants performed a basic-level naming task (e.g., "tiger") with 302 objects from 11 categories (animals, buildings, clothing, food, furniture, household items, musical instruments, plant life, tools, vehicles, weapons) that represented concepts from an anglicized version of a large property generation study <ref type="bibr">(McRae et al. 2005; Taylor et al. 2012)</ref>. All objects were presented in color as single objects on a white background. Each trial began with a black fixation cross on a white background for 500 ms before the object was shown for 500 ms, and followed by a blank screen lasting between 2400 and 2700 ms. The order of stimuli was pseudo-randomized such that consecutive stimuli were not phonologically related (i.e., shared an initial phoneme) and no more than 4 living or nonliving items could occur in a row. The stimuli were presented in 3 blocks. Stimuli were presented using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="a7ca243fe8-software-0">Eprime</rs> (version <rs corresp="#a7ca243fe8-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">2</rs>; <rs corresp="#a7ca243fe8-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Psychology Software Tools</rs>, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and object naming accuracy was recorded by the experimenter during data acquisition.</p>
            <p>The input to the HMax model were gray-scale versions of the images seen during the MEG recording that were resized to 92 × 92 pixels. Responses from different layers of the HMax model, the C1 and C2 responses, were extracted using the settings described by <ref type="bibr">Serre et al. (2005)</ref> and precomputed S2 features from natural image fragments (downloaded http://cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/standardmodel). For each object, the responses at the 2 layers were extracted separately, and C1 and C2 matrices were constructed containing responses for all 302 objects (C1 matrix dimensions 302 × 28608, C2 matrix dimensions 302 × 2000). Principal components analyses were then performed on each matrix (using the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="a7ca243fe8-software-simple-3">MATLAB</rs> function princomp). The number of components used in the final model was determined based on maximum model classification performance for data in the time window 100-300 ms using an independent group of participants performing the same task with similar objects (see <ref type="bibr">Clarke et al. 2013</ref>). This procedure identified that 12 HMaxC1 components and 6 HMaxC2 components resulted in maximum classification accuracy and so these values were used in the final set of models (range tested: 1-12, 30, and 50 components).</p>
            <p>Initial processing of the raw data used <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="a7ca243fe8-software-2">MaxFilter</rs> version <rs corresp="#a7ca243fe8-software-2" resp="#annotator5" type="version">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#a7ca243fe8-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Elektra- Neuromag</rs>). First, static bad channels were detected that were subsequently reconstructed by interpolating neighboring channels, as were bad channels containing long periods of high amplitude or noisy signals. The temporal extension of the signal-space separation technique was applied to the data every 4 s to segregate the signals originating from within the participants' head from those generated by external sources of noise, along with head movement compensation and transformation of head position to a common head position. An artifact removal procedure was applied to the continuous data based on independent components analysis (ICA), implemented using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a7ca243fe8-software-simple-7">EEGLab</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Delorme and Makeig 2004)</ref>. Components of the data that showed a correlation greater than a Pearson's r of 0.4 with either EOG channel were removed from the data. ICA was applied to the magnetometers and gradiometers separately.</p>
            <p>The resulting MEG data were low-pass filtered at 40 Hz in forward and reverse directions using a fifth-order Butterworth digital filter, epoched from −200 to 600 ms, and downsampled to 100 Hz using<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="a7ca243fe8-software-3">SPM</rs> <rs corresp="#a7ca243fe8-software-3" resp="#annotator5" type="version">8</rs> (<rs corresp="#a7ca243fe8-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Wellcome Institute of Imaging Neuroscience</rs>, London, UK). Items that were incorrectly named were excluded, where an incorrect name was defined as a response that did not match the correct concept. We did not explicitly account for potential muscle artifacts produced by the overt naming task as this should not affect our data considering the duration of the epoch examined and frequency range included in relation to the typical onset of muscle artifacts and their frequency distribution (mean naming latency: 991 ms, standard deviation over participants: 109 ms). Furthermore, any such artifacts are unlikely to be confounded with visual or semantic processing in such a way to affect classification accuracy or model fit.</p>
            <p>To visualize the cortical representation of the regression weights, the minimum norm source localization technique was implemented in<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="a7ca243fe8-software-4">SPM</rs> <rs corresp="#a7ca243fe8-software-4" resp="#annotator5" type="version">8</rs> using the IID option. Instead of using the regression weights derived from MEG data averaged over participants (those used for model fit and classification), for source localization, we calculated the regression weights for each participant separately, that were then used as the inputs to the source localization procedure. These individual participant localizations were used to provide more accurate source reconstructions than those that localizing the grand averaged data would have produced. Since the regression weights are obtained using linear equations with standardized predictors, they can be used for source localization <ref type="bibr">(Hauk et al. 2006)</ref>. MRI images were segmented and spatially normalized to an MNI template brain in Talairach space. A template cortical mesh with 8196 vertices was inverse normalized to the individual's specific MRI space. MEG sensor locations were coregistered to MRI space using the fiducial and digitized head-points obtained during acquisition. The forward model was created using the single shell option to calculate the lead-fields for the sources oriented normal to the cortical surface. The data from both magnetometers and gradiometers were inverted together <ref type="bibr">(Henson et al. 2009</ref>) to estimate activity at each cortical source using a minimum norm solution, where the inversion was performed simultaneously for all the regression weights for the epoch −200 to 600 ms. No depth weighting was applied. The estimated cortical activity was averaged across the specified time windows (70-160 and 200-400 ms-see Results) before generating an image in MNI space (absolute regression coefficient values), which was smoothed with a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian smoothing kernel. This produces a cortical representation of the regression weights for each predictor, which were then averaged across participants, and displayed on an inflated cortex using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="a7ca243fe8-software-5">Caret</rs> (<rs corresp="#a7ca243fe8-software-5" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.nitrc.org/projects/caret</rs>/). The color scale used was defined by the maximum absolute regression coefficient over all time windows and conditions with no thresholds applied.</p>

            <p>RNA secondary structure prediction is one of the earliest problems considered in computational biology. Despite a 30-year-effort towards its solution, the best algorithms and software for RNA structure prediction are still far from perfect. The most common approach to the RNA secondary structure prediction problem is the standard thermodynamic approach. This general methodology suggests to compute the secondary structure of an RNA molecule by minimizing the total free energy of its substructures such as stems, loops and bulges. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-6">alteRNA</rs> is an alternative thermodynamic approach to the RNA secondary structure prediction problem, which aims to minimize a linear combination of total free energy and total energy density using the dynamic programming formulation proposed in <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>, in contrast to the available alternatives such as <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-7">Mfold</rs> (4), <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-8">RNAscf</rs> (5) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-9">alifold</rs> <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>, which all employ the standard thermodynamic approach.</p>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, there are a number of algorithms for predicting the secondary structure of a single RNA molecule. However, until recently no such algorithm existed for reliably predicting the joint secondary structure of two interacting RNA molecules, or measuring the stability of such a joint structure. At <rs corresp="#d0427a8f9b-software-14" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SFU Lab for Computational Biology</rs>, we developed <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-14">inteRNA</rs> the first program that aims to compute the joint structure prediction of two given RNA sequences through minimizing their total free energy, which is a function of the topology of the joint structure. The algorithmic foundations of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-12">inteRNA</rs> were introduced in <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>.<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-13">inteRNA</rs> aims to minimize the joint free energy under a number of energy models with growing complexity. Our default energy model is based mostly on stacked pair energies given by <ref type="bibr">Mathews et al. (8)</ref>-the free energy model employed by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-14">Mfold</rs>. Because there is very little thermodynamic information on kissing loop sequences in the literature, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-15">inteRNA</rs> employs the approach used by <ref type="bibr">Rivas and Eddy (9)</ref> to differentiate the thermodynamic parameters of 'external' bonds from the 'internal' bonds, i.e. we simply multiply the external parameters with a weight slightly smaller than 1. Note that the default algorithmic engine used by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-16">inteRNA</rs> requires substantial resources in terms of running time and memory which could be prohibitive for predicting joint structure of sufficiently long RNAs. Thus we made available an alternative heuristic engine that aims to capture the joint secondary structure of interacting RNAs. This heuristic approach is based on the observation that the substructures that are available independently in each RNA are mostly preserved in their joint secondary structure.</p>
            <p>Regulatory ncRNAs play important roles in controlling gene expression via establishing stable joint structures with target mRNAs and prohibiting ribosomal access. As many novel regulatory RNA classes are being discovered, the determination of the exact functionality of all regulatory ncRNAs is one of the most significant scientific challenges to be tackled in the coming years. Our software tool <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-17">pRuNA</rs> is developed for helping to address this challenge: it aims to identify all potential regulatory ncRNAs that can establish stable joint structures with a query mRNA <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. An important component of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-18">pRuNA</rs> is a sequence filter which eliminates a significant fraction of the available ncRNA collection and retains only the most likely ncRNA candidates for forming a stable joint structure with the query mRNA. We note that the majority of regulatory ncRNAs are only partially complementary to their target mRNA sequences. Typically these RNAs contain at least two short (5-7 nt) motifs on their loop structures that are complementary to the specific single-stranded locations in the target RNAs <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. Thus <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-19">pRuNA</rs> first identifies all pairs of 5-mer motifs from the ncRNA loop sequences that are complementary to a pair of 5-mer motifs in the loop sequences of the query mRNA. The ncRNAs that include such 5-mer motif pairs are then tested against the query mRNA via the use of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-20">inteRNA</rs> and those which can establish stable joint structures are returned by the program.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-21">alteRNA</rs> requires a sequence in FASTA format, where the sequence is represented as a string of characters from the alphabet AE ¼ {A,C,G,U,T} (the characters are case insensitive). The length of the input RNA sequence is limited by 500 nt. There are two user-specified parameters, s and b, which will be explained in detail later.</p>
            <p>1. The predicted RNA structure in dot-parenthesis format. The sequence is given from 5 0 to 3 0 end, and the structure is given with matching parenthesis denoting a base pair and a dot denoting an unbounded base. 2. The predicted RNA structure in Connect(.ct) file format, which is the standard <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-22">Mfold</rs> output format. The sequence length is given in the first line. For each nucleotide i, there is a line which consists of: the line number (i), the letter denotion of the nucleotide, the predecessor base index (i À 1), the successor base index (i þ 1), the paired base index (0 if unpaired) and the original base index (i). 3. The graphics files for the predicted secondary structure in Postscript(.ps) and GIF format. These graphs are created using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-23">NAVIEW</rs> <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-24">Mfold</rs>/ plt2.</p>
            <p>The secondary structure predicted by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-25">alteRNA</rs> for 5sRNA is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>a.</p>
            <p>It has been shown in (3) that delocalizing the thermodynamic cost of forming an RNA substructure can be achieved by consideration of the energy density of the substructure, which, in return, can improve the secondary structure prediction of several ncRNA families. This alternative thermodynamic approach which we call Densityfold (3) aims to minimize the linear combination of the total free energy and total energy density of all substructures in the RNA molecule. Given an RNA secondary structure, the energy density of a basepair is defined as the free energy of the substructure that starts with the basepair, normalized by the length of the underlying sequence. The energy density of an unpaired base is then defined to be the energy density of the closest basepair that encloses it. Densityfold thus aims to minimize ED(n) þ sÁE(n), where ED(n) is the total energy density of paired and unpaired bases, E(n) is the total free energy and n is the length of the RNA sequence. Here s determines the weight of the contribution of the total free energy in the optimization function. As s approaches to 1, the predicted secondary structure gets closer to that implied by the standard thermodynamic approach (employed by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-26">Mfold</rs>). We have observed that s ¼ 5 generally gives the most accurate prediction, in terms of structure edit distance <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>, however in some RNA sequences, different s values can outperform s ¼ 5.</p>
            <p>Here a, b, c are constants in thermodynamic model, l s is the number of unpaired bases, l d is the number of base pairs and ddG stack is the free energy of each branch in the loop. The default setting for b, the coefficient for the number unpaired bases, is 0 in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-27">Mfold</rs>; this implies that there will be no penalty for the unpaired bases. However, when used with Densityfold, this setting seems to produce large stretches of unpaired bases in multibranch loops. In order to counter this effect we suggest the user to set b to a small positive value less than 1. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-28">alteRNA</rs>, our web-based tool for RNA secondary structure prediction via the Densityfold approach allows the user to specify any positive value for s and b. The default values of s and b are 5 and 0, respectively and the folding temperature is fixed at 378C.</p>
            <p>Input and output<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-29">inteRNA</rs> requires as an input two RNA sequences in FASTA format. The sequences are represented as strings of characters from the alphabet AE ¼ {A,C,G,U,T} (the strings are case insensitive). The length of each input RNA sequence is limited by 150 nt for Stacked Pair Model and by 500 nt for Loop Models. There are three user-specified parameters; gap penalty, maximum subsequence length and energy model; each of these parameters are explained in detail later.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-30">inteRNA</rs> reports the results in three different output forms:</p>
            <p>1. A text file that contains the base-pair information of the joint secondary structure. Here, each line denotes either a base pair with nucleotide indices or a gap.A sample interaction between CopA and CopT, predicted by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-31">inteRNA</rs> is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>b.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-32">inteRNA</rs> uses a dynamic programming algorithm, which aims to predict the joint secondary structure of two interacting RNA molecules through minimizing their total free energy. In other words, it predicts the secondary structure of both RNA strands and the interaction simultaneously. Since the general joint structure prediction problem is NP-Complete, it is necessary to set some limitations on the structures predicted: <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-33">inteRNA</rs> does not allow any (internal or external) pseudoknots; it does not allow any zig-zag structures either <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-34">inteRNA</rs> can employ the following two models for approximating the total free energy of the joint structure.</p>
            <p>Loop model: It has been observed that RNA molecules mostly preserve their independent secondary structure when they interact with other RNA. Interactions thus typically occur between kissing hairpin loops. The loop model first predicts the secondary structure of each RNA sequence independently using three different approaches: (i) through the standard thermodynamic model (<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-35">Mfold</rs> Loop Model), (ii) through Stacked Pair Model using a single RNA sequence (Default Loop Model) and (iii) through <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-36">alteRNA</rs> (<rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-37">alteRNA</rs> Loop Model). It then identifies all independent subsequences of each RNA structure: these are substructures (each implied by a basepair) whose sequence length is less than a specified value. It then computes the joint secondary structure that can be established between each pair of independent subsequences (one subsequence from each RNA) and the free energy of this joint structure. Finally, it finds the set of independent subsequence pairs which can co-exist and minimize the total free energy of the overall secondary structure.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-38">pRuNA</rs> asks for a query mRNA sequence as well as its corresponding secondary structure in parenthesis format. It returns a list of possible regulating ncRNAs available through the Rfam database <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>.</p>
            <p>At the heart of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-39">pRuNA</rs> we have a lookup table of size 1024 Â 1024, which represents every possible pair of 5-mer motifs from the 4-letter RNA alphabet. Each entry in the lookup table maintains a pointer to every occurrence of the respective 5-mer motif pair in the loop sequences of the ncRNA structures in the Rfam database. For querying the index, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-40">pRuNA</rs> first identifies the loop sequences from the mRNA, based on the given secondary structure information. It then extracts each pair of non-overlapping 5-mer motifs from the mRNA loop sequences and checks the lookup table for its reverse complement. The union of the set of ncRNAs that include each motif pair are retained by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-41">pRuNA</rs>, whereas the remainder of the ncRNAs in the database are eliminated. We have observed that many of the motif pairs in the lookup table occur very frequently in ncRNA sequences and thus have limited information content. We omitted the 5-mer pairs which occur in more than the number <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref> of ncRNAs that include a 'typical' motif pair. This increased our pruning efficiency substantially yet had no effect on the quality of the results: we have tested <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-42">pRuNA</rs> mRNAs that are known to be regulated by an ncRNA available through the NPInter database <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>. For all 24 of these mRNAs,<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-43">pRuNA</rs> was able to return the known regulatory ncRNA among the set of potential regulators, while achieving a pruning efficiency of 86% on the average. If the search is restricted to E. coli ncRNAs, the pruning efficiency for the 22 mRNAs regulated by these ncRNAs go up to 91% on the average.

            <p>Western blotting. Protein was extracted using conventional protocols (9 M urea, 4% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 1% dithiothreitol, 0.5% carrier ampholytes and cocktail of protease inhibitors). Protein concentrations were determined using Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) with bovine serum album as a standard. Subsequently, proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels using standard sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis techniques and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked by 5% milk (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) for 1 h and probed with specific antibodies for 4˚C overnight. Mouse anti-COX-2 polyclonal antibodies (dilution, 1 µg/ml; catalog no., 3362R-100; BioVision, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) were used, and mouse anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibodies (dilution, 0.3 ng/µl; catalog no., 60004-1-Ig; ProteinTech Group, Rosemont, IL, USA) were used as an internal reference.

The spectra were fitted using the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d4fb7c673d-software-simple-0">CONUSS</rs> program <ref type="bibr">35</ref> to derive hyperfine parameters including hyperfine magnetic fields of the Fe ions.</p>
            <p>Angle-dispersive XRD measurements were performed on powder samples at the 16-IDB beamline of the APS, ANL. The powder samples were gently ground from the same batch of the 57 Fe-enriched single crystals used for SMS experiments and loaded into the same symmetric DAC using Ne pressure medium and ruby pressure calibrate. XRD measurements of the starting sample showed consistent lattice parameters to the single crystals. To avoid systematic errors, care was taken to ensure that experimental conditions between SMS and XRD experiments were consistent: the same cryostat with the same temperature thermocouples and membrane controller were used in both experiments. Two types of XRD experiments were conducted: decreasing temperatures at a constant pressure with an x-ray wavelength of 0.4072 Å ; increasing pressures at a constant temperature of 50 K or 13 K with an x-ray wavelength of 0.3737 Å . Diffraction patterns were collected by a MAR345 detector and processed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d4fb7c673d-software-simple-1">FIT2D</rs> software. Rietveld refinements of the patterns were performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d4fb7c673d-software-simple-2">GSAS</rs> package <ref type="bibr">36</ref>.</p>

All transcribed data material from interviews and observations will be uploaded and systemised by using the software program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="c4b1ed4aba-software-1">QSR International NVivo</rs> V.<rs corresp="#c4b1ed4aba-software-1" resp="#annotator8" type="version">10</rs>. <ref type="bibr">39</ref> The data analysis is a combination of induction and deduction. In the diagnosis phase we will apply induction to establish the overall impression of the data material according to Malterud's <ref type="bibr">40</ref> systematic text condensation approach. This will involve the Norwegian speaking members of the research team. All team members will individually read the data material and come together in an analysis seminar to discuss the main themes <ref type="bibr">40</ref> emerging from the data and which are most important to incorporate in the training programme content and methods. This total impression along with the systematic literature reviews will form the basis for the action planning phase where the training programmes will be designed. The analysis of the data material from the implementation and evaluation phases will also be analysed according to the systematic text condensation approach. This analysis is deductive and theory <ref type="bibr">40</ref> driven as it will apply predefined categories based on Alvarez et al's 37 theoretical framework IMTEE. Research quality in terms of transferability to other contexts is key in qualitative research. <ref type="bibr">38</ref> Generalisability in the sense of exact replication of results across studies is not the goal of action research inquiries. According to Susman and Evered, <ref type="bibr">32</ref> the basis of generalisation in action research is narrow, situational and bound by context. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> This is also true for our study; however action research encourages transferability of project outcomes to similar settings when appropriate. Depending on contextual similarity, it is possible to judge the relevance of findings from our study and whether they can be applied to another study setting. There is a potential conflict between our purposive sampling and transferability of results to other settings. This will be addressed by providing details of the context in which our research occurs in our publications. Also, we will collect data about our sample regarding for example, their experience with technology, age, gender and education, which we consider of relevance for other studies and populations. This information will also be provided in our publications and enable a better ability to evaluate if our results are transferable to other contextual settings. <ref type="bibr">38</ref></p>

            <p>The vast majority of the cases included were bilateral reconstructions (81.9%); thus, there was concern that these breasts were not independent. Therefore, when possible, the analyses were adjusted for clustering to correct for any potential dependence between breast pairs. All continuous data were reviewed for potential outliers, which were defined as values &gt;3 SDs from the mean (11 breasts from 9 patients were excluded). Any cases with outliers were removed from analysis. The resulting patient characteristics, demographics, and complication frequencies between the 2 matrix types were compared using Fisher exact test (categorical variables), t tests, and Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables, normally or not-normally distributed, respectively). Additionally, a binomial logistic regression model using a general estimating equation (GEE) approach was used to determine significant predictors of whether a complication would occur or not. In addition to the matrix type, other a priori predictors were based on published data and included age, <ref type="bibr">25,26</ref> body mass index (BMI), <ref type="bibr">27,28</ref> duration of drain in place, <ref type="bibr">29</ref> preoperative radiation treatment, <ref type="bibr">20,27</ref> hypertensive status, <ref type="bibr">25</ref> and active smoking status. <ref type="bibr">20,27</ref> In all cases, significance was defined as P &lt; 0.05.

Events and molecule uses in the graphics are hyperlinked to HTML pages of information about the interaction or molecule. In addition, any predefined pathway or novel network can be exported in native PID XML or BioPAX Level 2 formats. Using the BioPAX export, a user can also visualize PID pathways in<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a72d9fa3f8-software-1">Cytoscape</rs> (<rs corresp="#a72d9fa3f8-software-1" resp="#annotator8" type="url">http://cytoscape.org</rs>) a popular third-party network visualization tool <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. For any predefined pathway, the user can obtain (and export to tab-separated format) a list of literature citations and participating molecules.</p>
            <p>Consistent with its focus on interactions and events derived from curated signaling cascades and regulatory processes, PID does not at present include interaction data deriving from high-throughput protein-protein interaction experiments. This reflects not a judgment on the quality of high-throughput data, but a recognition that there are databases specifically designed to provide access to this data <ref type="bibr">(11, 12, 13)</ref>. However, while it does not lead directly to the construction of signaling cascades, information from high-throughput protein-protein interaction experiments can be useful in interpreting the curated pathways and assessing their completeness. For example, a high-throughput protein-protein interaction experiment can identify an unexpected binding partner for a catalyst, suggesting the possibility that the in vivo presence of the partner can sequester the catalyst and thus turn off downstream interactions. In the future, PID will allow users to take advantage of high-throughput protein-protein interaction data, either by allowing users to upload interaction sets to be added to the novel networks created by PID queries or by querying other data sources (such as<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a72d9fa3f8-software-2">Pathway Commons</rs>, <rs corresp="#a72d9fa3f8-software-2" resp="#annotator8" type="url">http://pathwaycommons.org</rs>) as needed to support a user query. The PID data model is currently being integrated with NCI's Cancer Bioinformatics Infrastructure Objects model (caBIO) <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>, thereby making PID data accessible on NCI's caGrid <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>.</p>

The first release of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-2">RNALocate</rs> has contained more than 37 700 manually curated RNA subcellular localization entries with experimental evidence, involving 65 organisms (such as Homo sapiens, Musmusculus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), 42 subcellular localizations (such as Cytoplasm, Nucleus, Endoplasmic reticulum, Ribosome) and 9 RNA categories (such as mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA). Hence, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-3">RNALocate</rs> provides a more specific subcellular localization resource in which to efficiently investigate, browse and analyze a particular RNA, and even provides insight into the functions of hypothetical or novel RNAs. The whole data set can be easily queried and downloaded through the webpage, and visualization tools for interactively browsing and analyzing the data set are provided. In addition,<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-4">RNALocate</rs> also allows researchers to submit new RNA subcellular localization.</p>
            <p>In order to collect all available RNAs, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-5">RNALocate</rs> integrates all types of RNA symbols, mainly including microRNA symbols from the miRBase database (5), long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA symbols from NCBI Gene and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-6">Ensemble</rs> genome database <ref type="bibr">(6,7)</ref>. Other ncRNA category names are also included, such as transfer RNA and small nuclear RNA from <rs corresp="#fe5e3f3d9f-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NCBI</rs> Gene and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-9">Ensemble</rs> genome database <ref type="bibr">(6,7)</ref>. The list of subcellular localization names was collected according to the Gene Ontology (GO) <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>. We have written a simple script to screen all abstracts and articles in the PubMed database using the following keyword combinations: (each RNA symbol or RNA category name) and/or (each subcellular localization). The relevant hits were further inspected manually. Besides, we also retrieved several thousand subcellular localization entries from lncRNAdb (9), PomBase (10), FlyBase (11), TAIR <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref> and DOT (13) databases <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-9">RNALocate</rs> database is implemented using HTML and PHP languages with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-10">MySQL server</rs>. The interface component consists of web pages designed and implemented in HTML/CSS. It has been tested in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-11">Google Chrome</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-12">Firefox</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-13">Internet Explorer</rs> web browsers.</p>
            <p>RNA subcellular localization information was manually obtained from articles published in the PubMed database before May 2016. In current version, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-14">RNALocate</rs> documents 37 772 RNA subcellular localization entries with experimental evidence from 65 organisms, involving 42 subcellular localizations <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) and 9 RNA categories (including csRNA, lncRNA, mRNA, miRNA, piRNA, snRNA, rRNA, snoRNA and tRNA) <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). Among these, more than 1400 entries were collected from lncRNAdb, PomBase, FlyBase, TAIR and DOT databases. Each subcellular localization entry contains detailed information on RNA symbol, RNA category, alias, organism, sequence, homology, subcellular localization, tissue, validation method, PubMed ID, detailed description and network.</p>
            <p>In 'Submit' page, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-15">RNALocate</rs> invites users to upload novel RNA subcellular localization data, and in 'Blast' page, sequence alignment can be done after parameter selection. Except these, the whole data set could be downloaded through two approaches: 'Basic Download' and 'API' (application programming interface). In 'Basic Download' page, the whole data are saved in <rs corresp="#fe5e3f3d9f-software-29" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-29">Excel</rs> and TXT formats, users can get them by clicking the download button. In 'API' page, users can access part of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-18">RNALocate</rs> data by using script. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-19">RNALocate</rs> also provides three options in 'Help' page to supply instructions for using it, including 'Statistics' (detailed statistical tables), 'Tutorial' (procedure and illustrations of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-20">RNALocate</rs>) and 'Sister Databases'.<rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-21">RNALocate</rs> provides brief details of search results as a table in the 'Search Result' page, while more detailed descriptions such as PubMed ID and description of the reference are displayed in 'Detail' page reached by selecting 'more'. When selecting the specific RNA symbol in 'Search Result' page, the 'Detail' page presents more associated information of the RNA, such as organism, subcellular localization, alias, sequence, homology and validated method. More than 9200 RNAs with orthology/paralogy from miRBase and Homologene database have been provided in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="fe5e3f3d9f-software-simple-22">RNALocate</rs> for investigation on RNA subcellular localizations conservation. To further understand the interaction information between different RNAs in various types of subcellular localizations online, a 'Network' option has also been provided to visualize RNA interaction network with subcellular localization and organism <ref type="bibr">(14,15)</ref>.</p>

            <p>More and more newly sequenced genomes are becoming available every week. Tiling arrays are also gaining popularity for detecting novel transcripts in sequenced genomes. In this context, sequence annotation is an essential step in understanding the genome and the transcriptome of a species. Comparative genomics has proven to be a promising approach to address this problem. Large-scale comparisons of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes reveal thousands of conserved regions obtained by homology or synteny. These regions might be proteincoding sequences (1) or non-coding RNA genes <ref type="bibr">(2,3,4)</ref>. Annotation by comparative analysis typically involves two steps: first aligning the sequences, then analysing the multiple alignment to detect an evolutionary pattern that is representative of the selection pressure. This idea is exploited in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-0">Exoniphy</rs> (5) for exon detection, in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-1">RNAz</rs> <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref> or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-2">Evofold</rs> (7) for structural RNA prediction or in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-3">Qrna</rs> <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>, that implements both a coding and an noncoding model for RNAs. In this computational protocol, high-quality sequence alignment is an essential prerequisite step. This task, however, is difficult because sequence similarity is often reduced at the nucleic level.</p>
            <p>Regarding protein coding genes, nucleic acid sequences exhibit a much larger sequence heterogeneity compared to their encoded amino acid sequences due to the redundancy of the genetic code. It is well known that the combination of nucleic acid and amino acid sequence information leads to improved alignments <ref type="bibr">(9,10)</ref>. The same situation holds for non-coding RNA genes. The spatial structure evolves slower than its primary structure. So puresequence-based multiple alignment tools perform poorly on low-homology datasets of structural RNAs <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. In this article, we present the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-4">MAGNOLIA</rs> website, whose objective is to provide an advanced tool for aligning nucleic acid sequences. The idea is to get rid of the dichotomy between aligning and predicting the function. If we assume that sequences are either protein-coding or structural RNAs, it is possible to incorporate some functional information into the alignment algorithm to improve the result. The multiple alignment can then be used as a starting point to refine the comparative analysis or to carry out further predictions, such as motif finding or phylogeny reconstruction.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-5">MAGNOLIA</rs> includes three specific modules: <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-6">Protea</rs> for protein coding sequences, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-7">caRNAc</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-8">gardenia</rs> for structural RNAs. The overall scenario is summed up in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-9">Protea</rs> implements an evolutionary model for proteincoding sequences <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. Here the idea is that the selection pressure tends to preserve the encoded amino acid sequence, and it is possible to identifies coding sequences by looking for a global conservation of commonreading frames. The method first identifies best potential reading frames from each pair of sequences, and then incorporates this information into a frame graph from which a coding significancy score is calculated. By doing so, it also predicts the associated reading frame for each sequence. If the sequences are classified as proteincoding sequences, then the multiple alignment of nucleic acid sequences is built from the hypothetical amino acid sequences using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-10">ClustalW</rs> (13), <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-29">Dialign</rs> <rs corresp="#ea2ad8793c-software-29" resp="#annotator1" type="version">2</rs> (10) or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-13">T-coffee</rs> <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-14">caRNAc</rs> is for structural RNA genes <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>. In this model, the selection pressure tends to preserve the secondary structure of the molecule, and mutations should retain the ability to form base pairs into energetically favorable stems.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-15">caRNAc</rs> is able to recover a conserved secondary structure from a set of unaligned sequences. This idea is also present in refs. <ref type="bibr">(16,17)</ref>, that fold and align several sequences at the same time, for example. But these programs are still computationally demanding. We circumvent the problem by using a heuristics approach. The algorithm uses a Sankoff-based dynamic programing approach to identify conserved strutures for all pairs of sequences. Then all pairwise foldings are combined into a graph-theoretical structure called the stem graph. Only frequent common stems that correspond to highly connected subgraphs in the stem graph are retained.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-16">Gardenia</rs> is used to build the multiple alignment for potential structural RNA sequences. The method takes into account both the nucleic sequence and the putative common secondary structure predicted by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-17">caRNAc</rs>. It relies on the dynamic programming algorithm for pairwise comparison proposed in ref. <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. RNA sequences are encoded as arc-annotated sequences, and a multiple alignment for a set of arc-annotated sequences is a nested common supersequence. The edit scheme incorporates evolutionary operations concerning free bases (base substitution, base deletion) and base pairs (arc-mismatch, arc-removing, arc-breaking, arc-altering), originally defined in ref. <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>. It is easy to show that this problem is NP-hard. We take a heuristic approach and use a progressive method. The method starts with constructing all pairwise alignments to determine the degree of similarity for each pair of sequences. Then it combines sequences into a multiple alignment by an ascending hierarchical clustering. Pairwise alignment of supersequences rely on the same algorithm as pairwise alignments for arc-annotated sequences. This is made possible because supersequences can be viewed as a nested arc-annotated sequences on an extended alphabet. The score of one node is its SP (sum-of-pairs) score. Lastly, the space search of the dynamic programming alignment is pruned using constraints coming from the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-18">caRNAc</rs> output. This provides a significant speed up.</p>
            <p>Input<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-19">MAGNOLIA</rs> requires as input data a set of RNA or DNA sequences in the standard FASTA format. This set should contain at least two distinct sequences and at most ten sequences. It can be stored in a file to be uploaded to the server, or pasted directly in the text box.</p>
            <p>A typical run of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-20">MAGNOLIA</rs> takes a few seconds. Upon completion of a job, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-21">MAGNOLIA</rs> displays the result on a new web page. The job assigned a unique identifier that can be used to retrieve results for one week. All results are available for download in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-22">Clustal</rs> and bracket-dot format.</p>
            <p>If input sequences are annotated as coding sequences, then two multiple alignments are displayed. The first alignment is built on the putative amino acid sequences obtained by virtual translation using the predicted reading frame, and the second alignment is the corresponding alignment on nucleic acid sequences obtained by reverse translation, allowing for frameshifts. Codons in the nucleic acid sequences are put in color: two base triplets coding forthe same amino acid bear the same color. The color choice is inspired from the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-23">RasMol</rs> amino acid color scheme. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows an example of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-24">MAGNOLIA</rs> output obtained with a family of protein-coding sequences.</p>
            <p>If input sequences are annotated as structural RNA genes, then a multiple alignment taking into consideration the primary structure accompanied by the secondary structure is displayed. Concerning the secondary structure, base pairings are indicated in bracket-dot format: Each base-pair is represented by a pair of matching brackets and unpaired bases are represented by dots. The lack of pseudoknots in the secondary structure ensures that this notation defines a unique folding. Moreover, stems in the alignment are highlighted in colors. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows an example of output obtained with a family of non-coding RNAs. For each sequence, the individual putative secondary structure is also provided in five formats: CT, JPEG, PS, bracket-dot format and as a list of constrained base pairings. JPEG and PS files are automatically produced from the CT file using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-25">NAview</rs> layout program <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. Some data sets are not identified as coding RNAs nor as non-coding RNAs. The first possibility is that the sequences might have an alternative function, such as untranslated regions in messenger RNAs, promoter elements, etc. The second possibility is that the sequences are highly conserved. In this context, the comparative analysis approach used by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-26">MAGNOLIA</rs> is not suitable. The evolutionary signal is too weak and the sequences do not exhibit any significant mutational bias towards any model. This is an intrinsic limitation of the method. But this limitation is harmless for practical purposes, because standard multiple sequence alignment tools usually yield good results on high-identity data sets. So when the average identity percentage is greater than 90%, the server outputs a warning message and provides a default multiple alignment constructed directly with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-27">ClustalW</rs> on the initial data set.</p>
            <p>One final point worth mentioning is that the classification is not mutually exclusive. Some sequences might contain conserved secondary structure elements within a coding region. Two such examples are the cis-acting regulatory element from the human rhinoviruses, that is located in the open reading frame of the capsid proteins [RFAM -RF00220 <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>], or the Hepatitis C stem-loop VII structure found in the coding region of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase gene NS5B [RFAM -RF000468 <ref type="formula">(21)</ref>]. In such cases, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-28">MAGNOLIA</rs> releases two multiple alignments.</p>
            <p>For each family, we selected a subset of four sequences at random. It remains 6491 families, whose average sequence length is 604 bp. 6122 (94.3%) families are correctly classified as coding sequences, among them more than 99% with the correct reading frame predicted for each sequence. Less than 3% of the families are classified as structural RNA. To estimate the quality of the alignments, we used the sum-of-pairs score (SPS) of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-29">Baliscore</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. The SPS is calculated such that it increases with the number of sequences correctly aligned. We compared <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-30">MAGNOLIA</rs> with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-31">ClustalW</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-32">T-coffee</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-33">Dialign2</rs> on the same nucleic acid sequences. Results are displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.</p>
            <p>This benchmark contains 388 alignments, that are classified into high, medium and low identity data sets.<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-34">MAGNOLIA</rs> failed to identify a structural evolutionary pattern for 20% of them and falsely assigned a protein coding function for 7% of them. Following ref. <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>, we use the structure conservation index (SCI) to assess theaccuracy of alignments. This score provides a measure of the conserved secondary structure information contained within the alignment. Results for <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-35">MAGNOLIA</rs> are reported in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, together with results for other alignment tools used in the benchmark. We also evaluated the accuracy of the secondary structure found by<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-36">MAGNOLIA</rs> and compared it to two recent structural alignment programs: <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-37">Murlet</rs> <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-38">Mlocarna</rs> <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. For each software and for each identity class, we computed the percentage of correct base pairings amongst the set of predicted base pairings. Results are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. It appears that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-39">MAGNOLIA</rs> has similar performances as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-40">Murlet</rs> and outperforms <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-41">Mlocarna</rs>. Furthermore, the total runtime is more than 12 times faster for<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-42">MAGNOLIA</rs> than for the two other methods (&lt; 20 min for the whole data set, compared to more than 4 hours). <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-43">MAGNOLIA</rs> alignments on BRaliBase II. The x-axis represents the average identity percentage and the y-axis represents the SCI value. The above curve is calculated from reference alignments.<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="ea2ad8793c-software-simple-44">MAGNOLIA</rs> appears to be the closest curve to the reference curve for identity percentage ranging from 40% to 80%. For higher identity percentages, all methods show similar performances.</p>

BMI, fat body mass, and lean body mass decreased compared with the previous visit at 6 and 12 months in post hoc analysis. Decreasing fat body mass and decreasing BMI were associated with increasing BNP at 12 and 24 months by linear mixed-effects model analysis (P 5 0.01 and P 5 0.02, respectively, at 12 months; and P 5 0.01 for both covariates at 24 months). BNP increased compared with baseline at follow-up time points 12 and 24 months <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. NT-proBNP increased at 12 months but trended down at 24 months <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. Omentectomy had no effect on BNP or HTN. Given recent data showing that natriuretic peptides contribute to the "browning" of fat tissue, resulting in increased energy expenditure (5), their role in blood pressure regulation, weight loss, and lipolysis in patients undergoing RYGB surgery invites further inquiry.served as the principal investigator for the original clinical research study from which samples were obtained, verified data, and reviewed and edited the manuscript.

            <p>Bladder tissue was fixed and processed as described <ref type="bibr">(Khandelwal et al., 2008)</ref>; however, the Rab8 antibody only reacted if the following procedure was followed. After the frozen tissue was crosssectioned and rehydrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), we performed antigen retrieval by incubating the tissue for 7 min with quench buffer (20 mM glycine, pH 8.0, and 75 mM NH 4 Cl dissolved in PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. This was followed by a 3-min incubation in quench buffer containing 0.05% SDS and 0.1% Triton X-100. The tissue was then quickly rinsed three times with PBS and then three times for 5 min in the same buffer. When mounting the tissues, we found that enhanced image quality could be obtained if postfixation the tissues were rinsed with 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and then treated for 1-2 min each with ascending concentrations of thiodiethanol <ref type="bibr">(50, 75, and 97% [vol/vol]</ref>) dissolved in the same buffer <ref type="bibr">(Staudt et al., 2007)</ref>. The samples were then mounted in 97% thiodiethanol/Tris buffer containing 0.01% (wt/vol) phenylenediamine and stored at −20°C. The 97% thiodiethanol has the same refractive index as our immersion oil (1.1518). Although this solution worked well for proteins labeled with secondary antibodies, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin and To-Pro3 were quickly leached out the samples, necessitating the use of our standard glycerol-based mounting medium for these markers <ref type="bibr">(Acharya et al., 2004)</ref>. Images were captured using an HCX PL APO 63×/numerical aperture (NA) 1.3 glycerol objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) or a Leica STED 100×/NA 1.4 oil objective and the appropriate laser lines of a Leica TCS SP5 CW-STED confocal microscope (in normal confocal mode). The photomultipliers were set at 900-1200, and 8-bit images were collected using four to eight line averages combined with four to eight frame averages. Serial 0.25-μm z-sections were acquired. The images were imported into <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="e4ce9bac73-software-0">Volocity 4D</rs> software (<rs corresp="#e4ce9bac73-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">PerkinElmer</rs>, Waltham, MA) and, after image reconstruction, exported as TIFF files.

Briefly, stacks of dual-labeled confocal sections were imported into <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="e4ce9bac73-software-simple-8">Volocity</rs>, background noise was removed using the fine (3 × 3) median noise reduction filter, and a scatter plot of green and red pixel intensities (associated with each of the two markers in question) was generated using the colocalization function. A constant threshold of 40 was applied to both channels of the image stack, and Manders' colocalization coefficients for each of two markers (M X and M Y , respectively) were calculated for the entire three-dimensional image stack using the following equations <ref type="bibr">(Manders et al., 1993)</ref>:</p>
            <p>Bladder tissue was isolated and then fixed with 2.0% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde and 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM CaCl 2 for 60 min. The tissue was then cut into small pieces, washed with 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, cut into small blocks (2-5 mm in size), and then postfixed in 1.0% (wt/vol) OsO 4 and 1.0% (wt/vol) K 4 Fe(CN) 6 , in 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4. After a wash with water, the samples were en bloc stained overnight in 0.5% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate. The tissues were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and after incubation in propylene oxide, embedded in the epoxy resin LX-112 (Ladd, Burlington, VT) and cured 2 d at 60°C. Embedded tissue was sectioned with a diamond knife (Diatome, Fort Washington, PA), and sections, silver to pale gold in color, were mounted on Butvarcoated nickel grids, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed at 80 kV in a 100 CX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured using an L9C Peltier-cooled transmission electron microscopy camera system (Scientific Instruments and Applications, Duluth, GA). Digital images were imported into <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="e4ce9bac73-software-simple-9">Adobe Lightroom</rs>, and the images were processed by using the brightness, contrast, and clarity controls. When contrast was too low, adjustments to the tone curve were made to the whole image. Images were sharpened using a radius of 0.5, and luminance noise reduction was performed.

            <p>The crystallographers who determined the WWP1 structure described in detail its comparison with E6AP (3), and they produced several figures depicting superpositions carried out manually, similar to what <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-0">pFlexAna</rs> produces automatically. To our knowledge, there are currently no other computational tools that aim to automate such analyses.</p>
            <p>Our <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-1">pFlexAna (protein flexibility analyzer)</rs> web server aims at automatically detecting conformational changes between a pair of protein structures, without relying on sequence homology. Specifically, it detects regions exhibiting structural change, contrasted with regions exhibiting structural similarity. The <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-2">pFlexAna</rs> results can be viewed as indications of the endpoints of hypothesized molecular motions or mutation-induced conformational changes.</p>
            <p>To detect conformational changes in dissimilar proteins, we must first find structurally similar fragments (domains, sub-domains, etc.) in the proteins. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-3">pFlexAna</rs> employs a statistical test to match core protein fragments that are structurally similar and determine the geometric transformations that align them. This statistical test of structural similarity has been shown to be effective in detecting many different types of conformational changes (4). <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-4">pFlexAna</rs> displays the protein structures superimposed according to each aligned fragment pair. The superimposed display highlights the discontinuity from the similar to the dissimilar regions of the proteins and aids visualization of the conformational changes that occur relative to the aligned fragment pair used as the basis for superposition. See <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> for a sample result. Furthermore, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-5">pFlexAna</rs> clusters the aligned fragment pairs into 'super-alignments', according to the similarity of geometric transformations that align them. The result is that the dominant conformational changes occur between the clusters, while the smaller conformational changes occur within a cluster.</p>
            <p>As a complementary approach, for cases with low sequence homology, one may attempt structural alignment i.e. matching the proteins based on structural similarity instead of sequence similarity. However, both rigid and flexible structural alignment methods focus on finding a single best fit between the protein structures, and may ignore small yet significant conformational changes. Consider, for example, the relatively simple case of a same protein in two conformations. Given the bound and unbound structures [PDB codes 3MBP (10) and 1LLS:A (11)] of the maltose-binding protein, two popular structural alignment methods, CE (12) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-6">FATCAT</rs> (13), align the entire structures together without recognizing the hinge-like conformational change occurring between the two domains of the protein. FlexProt <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>, on the other hand, requires the user to know the number of hinges in order to interpret its results. What we need in this case is a method that automatically detects the 'discontinuity' in structural similarity at the hinge due to the conformational change and matches the two domains on each side of the hinge separately. See <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for a comparison between the results from <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-7">FATCAT</rs> and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-8">pFlexAna</rs>. In general, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-9">pFlexAna</rs> aims to detect such conformational changes for two related, but different proteins. Furthermore, it tries to identify and group together those protein fragments that move in tandem.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-10">pFlexAna</rs> server takes as input two protein structures in PDB format, which may be uploaded or specified using PDB codes. The user may also specify chain identifiers or a restricted range of residues for each file. Finally, there are two optional parameters that the user may adjust. The parameter k is the desired number of clusters for groupingthe aligned fragments together, and is the noise parameter, which determines how strictly structural similarity is applied. For low -values, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-11">pFlexAna</rs> matches only fragments that are highly similar. For high -values, it also matches fragments with weak similarity and ignores small differences. Based on our experiences, -values between 0.2 and 0.4 work well for proteins with reasonably highsequence homology (40% or higher). For proteins that are even more distantly related, we find -values up to 0.8 to be useful as well, though this may lead to false positive matches in some cases.</p>
            <p>Output<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-12">pFlexAna</rs> identifies pairs of fragments-one fragment from each protein-that show significant conformational similarity. They are listed in a table and grouped into clusters, according to the similarity of the geometric transformation that aligns the fragment pair. See <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> for an example. Two or more fragment pairs may move together and form a semi-rigid domain. By categorizing fragment pairs that are moving together versus moving independently, clustering helps to characterize conformational changes caused by domain movements or correlated motions.</p>
            <p>For each aligned fragment pair, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-13">pFlexAna</rs> provides a static cartoon of the proteins superimposed according to the aligned pair. This highlights the movement of the proteins with respect to the aligned regions. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-14">Jmol</rs> links are also provided so that the user may view the proteins from different angles. Finally, the transformed PDB coordinate files that align the second protein to the first are available for download and the transformation matrices used for alignment are provided. The same information is also provided for each cluster of aligned fragment pairs.</p>
            <p>To analyze the conformational changes between two protein structures, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-15">pFlexAna</rs> proceeds in two main steps. In the first step, it identifies pairs of fragments that are structurally similar. These fragment pairs serve as rigid cores for superimposing the two proteins and detecting conformational changes with respect to the cores. In the second step, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-16">pFlexAna</rs> clusters the aligned fragment pairs into 'super-alignments', according to the similarity of geometric transformations that align two fragments in a pair. The result is that the dominant conformational changes occur between the clusters, while the smaller conformational changes occur within a cluster. We now describe the two steps in greater detail below.</p>
            <p>To identify structurally similar fragment pairs,<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-17">pFlexAna</rs> uses an all-against-all approach that effectively compares every contiguous fragment from one protein with that from the other. First, we match the residues of the two proteins by 'sliding' one protein against the other <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>). For each sliding position, let P and P 0 represent the matched residues from the two proteins, respectively. We generate all contiguous fragments of P and P 0 and check their structural similarity by applying a reliable statistical test <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Briefly, this test uses a Gaussian noise model to represent acceptable deviations in atomic coordinates between two putatively similar protein fragments. Two fragments are considered statistically different if their coordinates deviate too much according to the Gaussian model. We then assign to each residue a flexibility score that incorporates information from all fragment comparisons that involve this residue. A high score indicates greater rigidity. Finally, each pair of aligned fragments must pass the following filter: the fragments must consist entirely of residues whose flexibility scores are above a threshold, and they must be longer than a given minimum length. Intuitively, this filter ensures that such a pair of fragments and all subfragments contained in them are structurally identical up to statistical variations. The minimum length requirement is imposed to avoid accidental structural matches. One advantage of our method is that it highlights the genuine conformational changes by suppressing the spurious ones due to noise. More details on this method and its advantages are available in ref. <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Since we perform anexhaustive comparison of all contiguous fragments in the two protein structures, our method can detect structurally similar fragments that are in opposite order along the protein sequences. After obtaining an exhaustive list of structurally similar fragment pairs, we need to resolve the conflicts among them. A conflict occurs if in the list of matched fragment pairs, a residue from one protein is matched with multiple residues from the other protein. In practice, we have found that biologically significant matches have much longer fragment length than the spurious ones due to accidental structural similarity. So we remove the conflicts in the list by preferring fragment pairs with longer length.</p>
            <p>Finally, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-18">pFlexAna</rs> hierarchically clusters the fragment pairs. The idea is to treat each structurally similar fragment pair as a point and divide these points into k clusters so that the dominant structural differences occur across clusters. To do this, we build a similarity graph. The vertices of this graph correspond to the fragment pairs obtained after conflict resolution. There is an edge between every two vertices, and the associated edge weight represents the similarity between the fragment pairs corresponding to the two vertices. Here, similarity is defined as the root mean square deviation (RMSD) for the best superposition when the two fragment pairs are combined. After constructing the similarity graph, we recursively remove from the graph the edge with the greatest weight and thus separate the most dissimilar fragment pairs, which represent the largest structural difference. We continue this edge removal process until the graph breaks into k connected components.</p>
            <p>The web server implementation of our method uses PHP for its front-end interface, C++ for back-end processing, and a Ruby daemon to interface the front and back ends. The output images are generated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-19">PyMol</rs> <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref> and interactive displays of each alignment are provided using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-20">Jmol</rs> <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>.</p>
            <p>We illustrate the results of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-21">pFlexAna</rs> on several representative cases.</p>
            <p>The crystal structures of the E6AP and WWP1 ubiquitin ligases [PDB codes 1D5F:C (2) and 1ND7 (3)] display a striking example of domain movement <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>).<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-22">pFlexAna</rs> finds six core regions of significant structural similarity between the proteins and successfully clusters them into two domains which move independently (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). These images are obtained directly from the web server, but annotated with an arrow and dotted ovals to draw attention to the domains that are aligned. The relative movement between the domains has been characterized as a 100 degree sweep with a 30 degree tilt <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. Superpositions, such as those shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, help to highlight the context of each protein region undergoing conformation change.</p>
            <p>The ubiquitin ligases have moderate sequence identity (&lt; 40%), but we have tested <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-23">pFlexAna</rs> on a range of protein pairs with low sequence identity such as the isomerase domain of glucosamine 6P synthase [1MOQ <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>] and arabinose binding protein [8ABP <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>], which have 10% sequence identity. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the alignments of 1MOQ and 8ABP. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-24">pFlexAna</rs> finds two independent domains. Each aligned domain centers around a parallel b-sheet buried by a-helices. In this figure, each alignment is rotated for viewing down the plane of an aligned sheet. To see the magnitude of the domain movement, note that the N-terminal domain of 8ABP (magenta) appears in the upper-right of both views, and 1MOQ (orange) is dramatically shifted between the two alignments.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-25">pFlexAna</rs> is particularly useful for proteins exhibiting domain moments, but applying it to proteins with more subtle conformational changes and without major domain movements can also be informative. In particular, we set parameter k = 1 when we expect only a single cluster corresponding to the aligned protein core. For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> compares two PX domain proteins [1KMD <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref> and 1GD5 <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>]. The N-and C-termini of the two proteins are conserved, but the loop region in between contains several insertions/deletions. Most structural alignment methods attempt to align these two proteins by superimposing their entire backbones globally. While this may be useful for some purposes, single global alignments may be skewed as they include the loop region. A more informative view of the evolutionary impact on conformational structure is shown by aligning only the conserved segments. On the PX domains, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-26">pFlexAna</rs> automatically finds the fragments of tightest similarity, distinct from the loop region, and it presents the clustered alignment result without skew from the inserted amino acids.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-27">pFlexAna</rs> is a new tool for protein structure comparison. It detects and displays conformational changes in remotely related proteins, without relying on sequence homology. Our tests show that <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-28">pFlexAna</rs> helps in analyzing a wide variety of conformational changes. It can detect conformational changes in proteins with identical sequences or those with very low sequence similarity. It can detect dramatic domain movements as well as smaller, more subtle conformational changes.</p>
            <p>The output of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-29">pFlexAna</rs> helps the analysis of conformational changes in several ways. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-30">pFlexAna</rs> uses a reliable statistical test of structural similarity to demarcate the protein regions that undergo conformational changes. It also clusters the protein fragments that move in tandem. The clustering helps in finding domains comprised of fragments that are discontiguous and out of order along the sequences, e.g. in the case of the maltose-binding protein <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Visualization of such information, provided in <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-31">pFlexAna</rs>'s output, helps the user to scan for hinge locations, active binding sites, domain movements, etc. For more detailed analysis, the user may use the quantitative information provided in <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-32">pFlexAna</rs>'s output, e.g. use the provided transformation matrix for alignment to compute the angle of bending at a particular hinge. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-33">pFlexAna</rs>'s output may also help users interested in predicting conformational motion. They may use the information that <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-34">pFlexAna</rs> provides as a starting point and combine it with other methods such as targeted molecular dynamics <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>, where an MD simulation trajectory is 'directed' from an inital conformation towards an alternative target conformation.</p>

            <p>NTera2 cells (NT2) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured as directed. To induce differentiation, cells were treated with 10 M all-trans-Retinoic acid (Cat# R2625, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO) for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 7 days. RNA was isolated using the Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit which incorporates an on-column genomic DNA clearance step (Cat# 7326820, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), quantified with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) and stored at −80 • C. ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-in Mixes (Cat# 4456739, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) were diluted and spiked into RNA samples which were then reverse transcribed using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix as directed by the manufacturer (Cat# 1708849, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) to make stock cDNA samples which were stored at −20 • C. Stock cDNA samples were pre-amplified for 10-20 cycles using SsoAdvanced PreAmp Supermix as directed by the manufacturer (Cat# 1725160, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) diluted at least 5-fold and stored at −20 • C. PreAmp was performed with panels of assays which include PrimePCR PreAmp assays (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), assays culled from public databases, assays designed using online software tools and assays from published manuscripts (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>; primers were at a final concentration of 50 nM each.

            <p>First, we chose the Ofcom model, which scores foods on the basis of their nutritional content per 100 g of the following nutrients to limit: energy, total sugars, sodium and saturated fat; and balances this against constituent elements considered conducive to health -fruit, nuts and vegetables, fibre and protein. Full details on how the Ofcom model is applied are available here. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> We used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="d0764fa22e-software-simple-0">Stata</rs> syntax (freely available on request) to generate Ofcom Scores for each food in the database, and adjusted the scores to fall on a scale from 1 to 100 where 1 is the least healthy and 100 is the most healthy.</p>
            <p>We ran pair-wise non-parametric Mann-Whitney U comparisons for the scores (both Ofcom and NVS) of each category of food, using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="d0764fa22e-software-simple-1">Stata</rs> software. We applied the Bonferroni adjustment to determine the appropriate P-value indicating the significance of our results. Since we ran 132 pair-wise comparisons for 12 categories of food, the original P-value of 0.05 was reduced to 0.000378, and only the comparisons with P-values lower than this were considered as significant. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the median and interquartile range of values in each food category for the nutrients used to calculate the Ofcom model. Saturated fat and sodium are the major parameters in this model that are relevant to animal products. Of the meat products, chicken offal is notably high in saturated fat (12.1 g per 100 g) but others have a relatively low median value (range = 1-3.8 g per 100 g) considering that the recommended daily allowance is 20 g. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Insects, however, have a far greater range of median values, from 2.28 to 9.84 g of saturated fat per 100 g. Median values for the sodium content of insects (range = 0-152 mg per 100 g) also show a greater range than for meat (range = 60-132 mg per 100 g). Values for protein content show the same pattern, with insects containing median values of between 9.96 g and 35.2 g of protein per 100 g, compared with 16.8-20.6 g for meat. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the median and interquartile range of values in each food category for the additional nutrients used to calculate the NVSs. Complete information is missing for all but two of the six insect species. The median iron content of crickets and honeybees is 180 and 850% greater (respectively) than for beef, which has the highest iron content of the three meats. However, iron content of beef offal is higher than crickets. All of the insects had higher calcium and riboflavin levels than any of the meats or meat offals. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the median and inter-quartile range of Ofcom scores for each food, and <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the P-values for pair-wise comparisons of these scores using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Bonferroni correction. There is no indication that any insect used in this analysis is a significantly 'healthier' alternative to meat using this model; instead, beef offal is classified as 'healthier' than three insects: crickets, palm weevil larvae and mealworms (P = 0.0001; P = 0.0001; P o 0.0001); and all meat and offal products are 'healthier' than palm weevil larvae. However, there is also significant variation between insect species: both crickets (P o 0.0001) and mealworms (P o 0.0001) are 'healthier' than palm weevil larvae. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the median and inter-quartile range of NVSs for each food, and <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> also shows the P-values for pair-wise comparisons between these scores. Using this model, there is no significant variation between insect species. Crickets (P o 0.0001), palm weevil larvae (P o 0.0001) and mealworm (P o0.0001) have a significantly higher score than beef and chicken, but the only other pair-wise comparisons with any significant difference are those showing that pork products are more nutritious than beef (P o 0.0001) and chicken (P o0.0001). However, of the insect species, only crickets and mealworm had nutritional information for every nutrient used to calculate this model; all the others had missing values.</p>

            <p>Initially, samples from eight study subjects were analyzed: four samples from healthy controls and four pre-high-flux hemodialysis samples. Whole blood was drawn into heparin tubes (Vacutainer, Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK) and then incubated with different concentrations of stimulators (formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] and anti-Fcε receptor I [FcεRI] antibody) to achieve the optimal concentration for a maximum basophil activation response <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>. fMLP was diluted in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) and concentrations of 10 −6 to 5 × 10 −5 M were prepared. Anti-FcεRI antibody (3 μg/mL) (Bühlmann Laboratories, Schönenbuch, Switzerland) was diluted (1:3) in stimulation buffer (Bühlmann Laboratories) and concentrations of 0.11 μg/mL to 3 μg/mL were prepared accordingly. Whole blood (100 μL) was distributed among polystyrene tubes (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and incubated with the relevant concentrations of fMLP and anti-FcεRI antibody at 37°C for 25 min to initiate the degranulation of basophils and histamine release. Subsequently the cells were stained with 18 μL of anti-CD203c-PE and CD63-FITC antibodies (Beckman Coulter, Paris, France) and incubated for 25 min at 4°C. Following lysis of red blood cells (RBCs) with 2 mL cold isotonic solution (154 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3 supplemented with 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2), samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g at 4°C; cells were then washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before being resuspended in 300 μL of cold PBS and subsequently analyzed. The surface expression of CD203c and CD63 on basophils was analyzed by flow cytometry (Navios, Beckman Coulter, Hialeah, FL, USA). Basophils were gated according to their granularity on side scatter and expression of CD203c <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a)</ref>. The percentage of CD63-positive cells within the total basophil population was calculated as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>b.

            <p>Flow cytometric analysis of surface CD11b, active CD11b, and CD88 expression on neutrophils Whole blood was drawn into EDTA tubes (Vacutainer, Becton Dickinson) before and after the hemodialysis procedure with high-and low-flux dialyzers, respectively. Blood (150 μL) was distributed in polystyrene tubes and mixed with 2 mL cold isotonic solution to lyse the erythrocytes. After 5 min, the tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g at 4°C, the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were washed with PBS. The tubes were divided into three groups: the unstimulated cells, the cells stimulated with increased temperature (+37°C), and the cells stimulated with IL-8 (CXCL8) (Research &amp; Diagnostics Systems, Abingdon, UK). RPMI 1640 medium (200 μL) mixed with 10% fetal calf serum was added to all the tubes. IL-8-stimulated cells were stimulated with a final concentration of 100 ng/mL IL-8 <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. The unstimulated cells were incubated on ice, while the stimulated cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The tubes were washed with PBS, and cells were resuspended in 100 μL of cold PBS. Antibodies were added to the relevant tubes-anti-CD11b-FITC (Beckman Coulter; 20 μL) and anti-CD11b-PE (activated form, clone CBRM1/5, BioLegend Inc., San Diego, CA, USA; 20 μL), as well as corresponding isotype controls (IgG1). The tubes were incubated for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 350 μL of cold PBS, and subsequently analyzed.

            <p>All measures were coded so as to be consistent such that higher values indicate more positive orientations toward e-cigarettes and the likelihood of their use. Descriptive analyses used appropriate measures of central tendency and dispersion. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess scale reliability. Tests for differences and associations were done so as to separate the effect of student status and smoking status due to their conflation. Factorial ANOVA was used to compare differences in means across student status and smoking status, with effect sizes calculated (h 2 ). Partial correlations (r and eta) controlling for smoking status were used to assess associations within student status and to compare associations across student status. Across-group comparisons of associations were tested using Fischer's r-to-z transformation. Data were weighted for comparison of student and non-student groups. All analyses were conducted using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="da0eaaf5ed-software-0">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#da0eaaf5ed-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">13</rs>. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> reports descriptive statistics and tests of differences between students and non-students, without regard to smoking status. The groups were equivalent in terms of sex, but non-students were somewhat older. There were no significant differences on the race/ethnicity Brief Reportmeasures. While the percentages of former and occasional smoking were equivalent, a significantly greater proportion of students were never smokers, while a significantly greater proportion of non-students were daily smokers. On electronic cigarette use, a greater proportion of students were never vapers and a grater proportion of non-students were occasional vapers. There was not a significant difference at P&lt;0.05 in the percentage of dual users (among the 144 current smokers, which might support a relaxed alpha in which case the rate is higher among non-students). Non-students were also significantly more approving of public smoking, had a greater intention to use electronic cigarettes, and reported greater information exposure on electronic cigarettes. There were no significant differences on the remaining items (public vaping, attitude, norms, and innovation). <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> reports the simultaneous effects of smoking status (ever versus never) and student status on the eight variables of interest, with allowance for interaction terms. Significant differences were found for each variable conditioned on smoking, with uniformly small-to-medium effect sizes. Student status showed no main effects. Two significantinteraction effects were found, however, as reported in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. A cross-over interaction was found for information exposure in which student ever smokers scored higher than nonstudent ever smokers and student never smokers scored lower than non-student never smokers (meaning, students who smoked had more exposure to information about e-cigarettes, but students who didn't smoke actually had less exposure to information about e-cigarettes than non-students). Also, student ever smokers scored higher on alternate tobacco use than did non-student ever smokers, while the never smokers were equivalent across student groups. A closer look revealed that hookah use was dominant. Among ever smokers, the hookah use score was significantly higher among students (1.97 versus 1.61, t(191)=3.1 P&lt;0.01), with 58.3% of the non-students having never tried hookah, compared to 27.4% of students (χ 2 (3)=23.5 P&lt;0.001). Further examination also shows a higher rate of vape/hookah dual use. Among the student ever smokers who vape some days or every day, 50% use hookah some days or every day. The rate among non-students is half that, 26.3% (χ 2 (4)=17.6 P&lt;0.01). <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> reports partial correlations among the eight variables of interest, controlling for smoking status. Separate correlations were run for students and non-students. The Fischer r-to-z transformation was used to test for differences between coefficients. No significant differences were found, thus the correlations can be interpreted as equivalent. Different sample sizes account for some of the borderline contrasts between the groups (approximately r=0.10 required for significance). Despite no contrasts between student and non-students, the correlation analysis does reveal some interesting results. The variables can be considered as five attitudinal and two behavioural measures (with intention in the latter with alternate tobacco use). Each of the attitude measures presents a significant association with both of the behavioural measures, with the exception of information with intention. Of note, attitude, norms, innovation, and information have medium-to-strong associations with the two key variables of interest: behavioural intention to use an electronic cigarette and acceptability of public vaping.</p>

All the variables were dichotomous except age and total duration of work in this type of factory. Section I was designed in English, translated into Bengali and Hindi, reviewed by a local primary school teacher and pretested extensively on six local similar workers who were not involved in the study. Section II included the standardised St. George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) to measure the respiratory health status. <ref type="bibr">7 13 14</ref> This questionnaire has been widely used in the general population, different industrial workers and patients with respiratory diseases. <ref type="bibr">8-10 15</ref> There are two parts: part 1: questions 1-8 address participants' recollection of their symptoms over the preceding period of 3 months, and part 2: questions 9-16 address participants' current state (questions 11 and 15 measure disturbances to participants' daily physical activity, and questions 9-10, 12-14 and 16-17 cover a wide range of disturbances of psychosocial function). A total score is calculated that summarises the impact on overall respiratory health status. The score is expressed as a percentage of impairment where 100 represents the worst possible respiratory health status and 0 indicates the best possible respiratory health status. The SGRQ is available in English, Bengali and Hindi. <ref type="bibr">7 13-15</ref> Sample size As this was the first study of respiratory health status of coal-based sponge iron plant workers, no information was available on which to base the sample size calculation.

            <p>Electrical test system. A PXI bus test system was constructed to provide high stable powers for the sensors and to precisely measure the collecting currents from pA to nA. The test system based on PXI bus was consisted of a 14-Slot Chassis (NI PXI-1044), a controller module (NI PXI-ExpressCard8360), five digital multimeter modules (NI PXI-4071), and three power modules (NI PXI-4132). The three power modules provided voltages needed for the electrodes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref>. Two of the power modules were connected in series to provide 0-150 V voltage for extracting electrodes of the sensors, and the other power module provided 0-100 V voltage for collecting electrodes. The digital multimeter modules with shielded cables are capable of acquiring the collecting currents from pA to nA for five sensors at the same time. All acquired data were recorded to a computer through a <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a584cb90a8-software-simple-0">LabVIEW</rs> program linked to MXI interface.</p>

            <p>Chemical structures were retrieved either from PubChem (https:// pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed in March 2012) or ChemSpider (http:// www.chemspider.com/, accessed in March 2012) databases using chemical names. Chemicals were removed if their structures could not be found. Each dataset was carefully curated according to previously established guidelines <ref type="bibr">(Fourches et al., 2010)</ref>. Briefly, counterions were removed, whereas specific chemotypes such as aromatic and nitro groups were normalized using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-0">ChemAxon Standardizer</rs> (v.<rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-0" resp="#annotator26" type="version">5.3</rs>, <rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">ChemAxon</rs>, Budapest, Hungary,<rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-0" resp="#annotator26" type="url">http://www.chemaxon.com</rs>). The presence of duplicates, i.e., identical compounds reported more than once in the same dataset, is known to lead to over-optimistic estimations of the predictivity for developed QSAR models. However, the analysis of such records also gives an estimate of the dataset quality: if activity data for the same compound are consistent, the overall data quality is high; if there is a large deviation in experimental values between different records of the same compound, the quality is, obviously, low. Thus, after the structural standardization, the duplicates were identified using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-4">ISIDA Duplicates</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Varnek et al., 2008)</ref> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-5">HiT QSAR</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Kuz'min et al., 2008)</ref> software and carefully analyzed. If the experimental properties associated with two duplicative structures were identical, or highly similar, then one compound was chosen at random and deleted. However, if their experimental properties were significantly different, we deleted both records from the dataset. During the curation of human skin permeability dataset, we found 17 pairs of duplicate structures and two sets of triplicates as shown in <ref type="table">Table S</ref>3. The permeability values for duplicative records were almost identical (logKp variation ~ 0.01 LU) except those for butanoic acid that had a variation higher than ca. 0.4 LU. Thus, the LogKp value for all 17 compounds was averaged and the duplicative records were removed so that only one permeability coefficient was used for a chemical compound.</p>
            <p>Hierarchical Cluster Analysis-The clustering of a chemical dataset consists of merging compounds into distinct clusters of chemically similar molecules [see <ref type="bibr">(Downs and Barnard, 2003; Mercier, 2003)</ref> for a review of the most popular clustering approaches used in computational chemistry]. In this study, we have employed the Sequential Agglomerative Hierarchical Non-overlapping (SAHN) method implemented in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-3">ISIDA/Cluster</rs> program (<rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-3" resp="#annotator26" type="url">http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(Varnek et al., 2007)</ref>. Briefly, each compound represents one cluster at the start. Then, the m compounds are merged iteratively into clusters using their pairwise Euclidean distances stored in a squared (m * m) symmetric distance matrix. The two closest objects (molecules or clusters) are iteratively identified and merged to form a new cluster, the distance matrix being updated with the re-computed distances separating the newly formed cluster and the others, according to the user-specified type of linkage (complete linkage in this study).

At the 2D level, the connectivity of atoms in a simplex, atom type, and bond nature (single, double, triple, or aromatic) have been considered. SiRMS descriptors account not only for the atom type, but also for other atomic characteristics that may impact biological activity of molecules, e.g., partial charge, lipophilicity, refraction, and an atom ability for being a donor/acceptor in hydrogen-bond formation (H-bond). For atom characteristics with continuous values (charge, lipophilicity, and refraction) the division of the entire value range into definite discrete groups has been carried out. The atoms have been divided into four groups corresponding to their (i) partial charge A≤−0.05&lt;B≤0&lt;C≤0.05&lt;D, (ii) lipophilicity A≤−0.5&lt;B≤0&lt;C≤0.5&lt;D, and (iii) refraction A≤1.5&lt;B≤3&lt;C≤8&lt;D. For H-bond characteristic, the atoms have been divided into three groups: A (acceptor of hydrogen in H-bond), D (donor of hydrogen in H-bond), and I (indifferent atom). The usage of sundry variants of differentiation of simplex vertexes (atoms) represents the principal feature of the SiRMS approach <ref type="bibr">(Kuz'min et al., 2007)</ref>.

            <p>Random Forest-Random Forest models were constructed according to the original RF algorithm <ref type="bibr">(Breiman, 2001)</ref> using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-8">CF</rs> software version <rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-8" resp="#annotator26" type="version">2.12</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Polishchuk et al., 2009)</ref>. RF is an ensemble of single decision trees. Outputs of all trees are aggregated to obtain one final prediction. Each tree is grown as follows: (i) a bootstrap sample is produced from the whole set of N compounds to form a training set for the current tree. Compounds that are not in the training set of the current tree are placed in the out-of-bag (OOB) set (size of ~ N/3); (ii) the best split by CART algorithm <ref type="bibr">(Breiman et al., 1984)</ref> among the m randomly selected descriptors from the entire pool in each node is chosen; (iii) each tree is then grown to the largest possible extent; there is no pruning. The predicted classification values are defined by majority voting for one of the classes. Thus, each tree predicts values for only those compounds that are not included in the training set of that tree (for OOB set only). Since RF possesses its own reliable statistical characteristics (based on OOB set prediction) which could be used for validation and model selection, no cross-validation was performed <ref type="bibr">(Breiman, 2001)</ref>. Thus, the final model is chosen by the lowest error for prediction of the OOB set. The local (tree) applicability domain approach <ref type="bibr">(Artemenko et al., 2011)</ref> was used for all RF models developed in this study.</p>

Human skin permeability dataset (dataset D) was imported to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-16">DERMWIN</rs> as SMILES strings, and logKp was calculated and compared to the predictions of our models.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-12">DERMWIN</rs> module available as part of the <rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-12" resp="#curator" type="publisher">EPI Suite</rs> software has been employed in several recent studies <ref type="bibr">(Fong and Tong, 2012; Fong et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2013)</ref> for evaluating skin permeability. For this reason, we decided to compare our models with that implemented in this software. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-19">DERMWIN</rs> uses a linear equation that relates the permeability coefficient with the chemical's octanol/water partition coefficient and molecular weight. However, statistical characteristics of this model suggested that this correlation was not adequate to predict human permeability. Although our consensus model 12 had a lower coverage of chemical space than <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-20">DERMWIN</rs> (77% vs. 100%), it significantly outperformed <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-21">DERMWIN</rs> in predictivity (Q 2 ext = 72% vs. 43%, respectively) (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). When the AD restriction was removed and the predictive accuracy of the models was evaluated using the same set of compounds (143 compounds), the comparison was in favor of our model (Q 2 ext = 71% vs. 66%, respectively) (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>).</p>
            <p>We have built statistically significant and externally predictive QSAR models of skin permeability that can be used to predict the permeability of untested compounds through the skin. Comparison of the developed consensus model with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-22">DERMWIN</rs> software showed that our model significantly outperformed <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-23">DERMWIN</rs> in predictivity (Q 2 ext = 72% and 43%, respectively) but at the expense of some lost in coverage (77% vs. 100%); when applied to the same set of compounds as used for <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-24">DERMWIN</rs> (ignoring the AD for our models) the performance of our model is still higher (Q 2 ext = 71% vs. 66%).

            <p>Feasibility studies are not designed to detect a treatment effect and analysis should be mainly descriptive or concentrate on confidence interval (CI) estimation <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. Data (mean, CIs) are presented below for interest even though the study was not powered to detect an effect of the intervention. Questionnaire feasibility was determined via participant acceptability, mean duration for completion (minutes), and standardised response means (SRM), a measure of the sensitivity of each questionnaire to detect change. SRM was calculated as mean change in scores or values divided by the standard deviation in change scores <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. The SRM provides the relative magnitude of mean change compared with the variability of change, with higher SRM values indicating greater sensitivity. BMI and waist circumference measurements were converted to SDSs using UK 1990 growth references <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. For selection of a primary outcome for the multi-centre trial (based on the ability of BMI, waist circumference, and BIA to predict DXA), multiple linear regression modelling was used, starting with a full model and using backwards selection, to identify which variables were predictors of DXA fat mass after adjusting for age and gender. Model assumptions were checked (normally distributed residuals and constant variance) and, when necessary, variables were log transformed to improve model fit. The models that best predicted baseline DXA (those with the most significant predictors and the highest R 2 value) were then applied separately to the 6-and 12-month DXA results in order to see how well the models predicted fat mass.

            <p>Prior to conducting the full study, we completed a pilot study to confirm the accuracy of knee ROM measurements obtained using an electrogoniometer (SG150, Biometrics Ltd., UK), which was used as the criterion value for the evaluation of the measurement error of the universal goniometer. A standardized procedure was used to position the electrogoniometer for the recording of knee joint ROM positions. The electrogoniometer was attached to the right leg using double-sided tape, with the knee flexed to 60°. The proximal point of attachment was localized 1 cm from the lateral epicondyle of the femur, along a line connecting the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the femur. The distal point of attachment was localized 1 cm from the head of the fibula, along a line connecting the head of the fibula and the lateral malleolus. The bony landmarks used as a reference for the localization of the electrogoniometer were identified by palpation and marked. A thin string was attached with tape between both pairs of landmarks (i.e., greater trochanter and lateral epicondyle of the femur; head of the fibula and lateral malleolus). The thin string was used as a guide to attach the electrogoniometer. Once the electrogoniometer was placed and secured, an elastic wrap was used to prevent slipping of the electrogoniometer during measurements, as well as to hide its position from the participants performing measurements using a universal goniometer. Reflective markers were then placed over the bony landmarks, namely the greater trochanter, lateral epicondyle of the femur, head of the fibula, and lateral malleolus to visualize their positions on digital images captured obtained by a two-camera system (B-CAM, DKH, Japan). Passive knee ROM was measured by one experimenter, from full extension to maximum flexion, with the experimenter taking care to maintain the knee motion in the sagittal plane, avoiding adduction/abduction and internal/external rotation motions of the hip as much as possible. The measurement was recorded by the two-camera system with the signals between the cameras and the electrogoniometer synchronized using a trigger switch. The knee joint position data obtained from the electrogoniometer and the imaging data captured by the cameras were analyzed using a motion analysis system (Frame-DIAS V, DKH, Japan). For the imaging data, the knee joint angle was defined as the angle formed by the line connecting the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle and the line connecting the head of the fibula and the lateral malleolus. Agreement between the imaging and electrogoniometer data was evaluated by simple linear regression, using the imaging data as the dependent variable and the electrogoniometer data as the independent variable. The level of agreement between the electrogoniometer and imaging data was high at knee flexion angles of 20° to 90° (y=0.960x, R 2 =0.998, p&lt;0.001). Therefore, we used this range of knee motion for the main experiment. Statistical analyses were performed with <rs corresp="#ba84c84697-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">IBM</rs> <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="ba84c84697-software-1">SPSS Statistics</rs> software (ver. <rs corresp="#ba84c84697-software-1" resp="#annotator20" type="version">23</rs>).</p>
            <p>The following variables were used in the analysis: level of proficiency, defined as the number of years since receiving basic instruction in goniometry measurement; measurement error; and measurement time. The means and standard deviations (SD) of the measurement error and measurement time were calculated for the proficiency level (1-6 years). Reproducibility of the end-point of knee ROM by the volunteer was evaluated for the first (60°) and second (75°) trials by calculating the mean and SD of the values recorded by the electrogoniometer. The absolute measurement error was calculated as the difference between the ROM measure of the electrogoniometer and the measure reported by the participants. The mean, SD and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the absolute error was calculated for each proficiency level. Split-plot analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effect of proficiency level on the absolute measurement error and measurement time as dependent variables. A Bland-Altman analysis was performed to evaluate the presence or absence of systematic bias in the ROM measurements obtained using a universal goniometer. The differences between the measurements obtained with the electrogoniometer and the universal goniometer were plotted along the y-axis, with the mean of both measurements plotted along the x-axis. The mean difference (md), SD of the md (SD dif ), and 95% CI of the md were calculated to identify systematic (fixed) errors. A simple linear regression analysis was performed to identify possible proportional bias. The magnitude of the random error in measurement was evaluated by calculating the MDC at the 95% CI level (MDC 95 ) as follows: MDC 95 =1.96 SD dif . All statistical analyses were performed using <rs corresp="#ba84c84697-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">IBM</rs> <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="ba84c84697-software-3">SPSS Statistics</rs> software (ver. <rs corresp="#ba84c84697-software-3" resp="#annotator20" type="version">23</rs>).</p>

            <p>The institutional review board at University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) approved the laboratory study, which complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. AMD eyes were identified through an ex vivo imaging screen of eyes accessioned for research purposes from nondiabetic white donors to the Alabama Eye Bank during the period 1996 to 2012. Median death-to-preservation time was 3:49 hours (range, 0:40-11:40 hours). Thirteen eyes with GA were reviewed for examples suitable for this study. Ophthalmic health records were not available for these donors. Eyes were preserved by immersion in 1% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer following anterior segment excision. After vitreous removal, maculas were photographed in color on a stereomicroscope (SMZ-U; Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). <ref type="bibr">27</ref> When prepared for histology (2011-2013) and uploaded to the Project MACULA Web site (http://projectmacula.cis.uab.edu, in the public domain), eyes underwent additional multimodal ex vivo imaging.

            <p>Tissue assessments. The primary end point of the study was to determine the effects of treatment on tumour stroma including assessment of collagen content and structure and CAFs. In addition to study samples obtained from patients and mouse models, we also analysed a set of six samples from patients with untreated PDA and six samples from patients treated with conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Collagen analysis was assessed using collagen I primary rabbit antibody (1 : 100; Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, USA) for 1 h at 37 1C and as secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Activated fibroblasts were determined with double staining using vimentin, as total fibroblasts marker (1 : 50; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) as an activated fibroblast marker (1 : 100; DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen) for vimentin and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen) for SMA. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen) and mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope TCS-SP5 (AOBS) Leica (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with two magnifications Â 20 HCX PL APO CS (0.7 NA) and Â 40 HCX PL APO CS (1.25 NA) oil immersion objectives.

Fibroblast quantification was performed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="b9dd138652-software-simple-3">Definiens Developer XD</rs> Software (Munich, Germany). Detected cells were classified depending on the ratio between mean layer intensities of both, vimentin and SMA. Activated fibroblasts were considered when they co-expressed SMA and vimentin. We determined the fibroblast density index by adjusting the number of cells counted to the proportion of tumour fibrosis observed in the specimen (adapted from <ref type="bibr">Erkan et al, 2008)</ref>. The quantification was done in two different and representative fields (20 steps) for each sample. In the preclinical study, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against mouse SPARC (R&amp;D Systems, MAB942, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9661).</p>

Quantitative variables pre-and posttreatment were compared using ANOVA test, Student's t-test, and non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon test for two related samples. The correlation between the outcome variables was tested with the Spearman correlation coefficient. In the preclinical study, all values are represented as mean ± s.e.m. Immunohistochemistry quantifications were evaluated for significance using the unpaired t-test with a P-value below 0.05 considered significant for all analyses. Significant differences between experimental groups were: *Po0.05 or **Po0.01.</p>

            <p>A paper from Jamaica explains how the <rs corresp="#fd3867235c-software-10" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2009</rs> versions of the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="fd3867235c-software-10">EPP</rs> and Spectrum tools have been applied in Jamaica, together with the country-specific data and assumptions, to assess the course of the epidemic and to set programme targets. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Analytical papers based on new estimates explore various topics. A paper on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) quantifies the effect of epidemic trends and PMTCT programmes on the annual number of new child infections. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> In addition, the paper explores which efforts are needed to virtually eliminate new child infections through mother-to-child transmission by 2015. An updated analysis of the contribution of HIV to under-five mortality shows a decrease in recent years. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The effect of changing global guidelines of the starting criteria for the initiation of ART on the number of people estimated to be eligible for ART is assessed. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> A second paper, focused on ART, estimates the impact of ART on mortality and estimates how many life-years have been gained through ARTamong adults. 14 A final analytical paper uses recent biological and behavioural surveillance data from young people aged 15e24 years in the most affected countries to assess trends in HIV prevalence and sexual behaviour. The analysis shows that, among the countries with sufficient data for the analysis, in 10 countries there is evidence of significant declines in HIV prevalence of at least 25% since 2000, while an additional six countries have non-significant declining trends, and another five do not show declining trends. <ref type="bibr">15</ref></p>
            <p>Looking towards the future, we expect several new developments in estimation tools. First, it is desirable that <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="fd3867235c-software-simple-2">EPP</rs> and<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="fd3867235c-software-simple-3">Spectrum</rs> be integrated, thereby allowing streamlining of the handling of demographic and ART data, and in doing so avoiding errors. Second, a more flexible epidemic model should be included in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="fd3867235c-software-simple-4">EPP</rs> to improve on the current phi-shift feature, building on the proposals by Hogan <ref type="bibr">16</ref> and Bao. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Many countries now have seen a decline in prevalence and these would be expected to show an increase in prevalence in future years as a result of either increased survival due to ART of a large proportion of all people living with HIV or of increased transmission, or both. Third, with ART programmes expanding and maturing, improvements in modelling epidemics should be expected from the tracking of HIV-infected individuals by their CD4 level. Fourth, for mother-to-child transmission, the new WHO guidelines should be incorporated in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="fd3867235c-software-simple-5">Spectrum</rs>.</p>
            <p>While <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="fd3867235c-software-simple-6">EPP</rs> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="fd3867235c-software-simple-7">Spectrum</rs> work well for countries where survey-derived data constitute the bulk of the surveillance data, they are not well adapted for countries that rely mostly on HIV and AIDS case reporting for HIV surveillance. Many European countries rely on such data and a new initiative coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Control hopes to develop estimation tools appropriate in such settings.</p>

            <p>1-3 uL of samples loaded in home-made gold-coated borosilicate capillaries were directly infused into an Exactive Plus Orbitrap instrument with extended mass range (EMR) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) using an m/z range of 500-10,000 Th. The voltage offsets on transport multi-poles and ion lenses were manually tuned to achieve optimal transmission of protein ions at elevated m/z. Nitrogen was infused in the higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) cell at a gas pressure of 6-8 £ 10 ¡10 bar. MS parameters were adjusted as follows: spray voltage 1.2-1.3 V; source fragmentation 30 V; source temperature 250 C; collision energy 30 V; resolution (at m/z 200) 17,500. The instrument was mass-calibrated using CsI clusters, as described previously. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> The raw mass spectra were deconvoluted using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d25fd4333c-software-0">Protein Deconvolution</rs> v<rs corresp="#d25fd4333c-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#d25fd4333c-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Thermo Fisher Scientific</rs>, Germany) and<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d25fd4333c-software-1">BioAnalyst</rs> v<rs corresp="#d25fd4333c-software-1" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#d25fd4333c-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">AB/Sciex</rs>, Canada).

The release, purification, injection, data acquisition and analysis of N-glycan were performed following the described previously protocols. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> In brief, N-glycans were released from reduced mAb by PNGase F digestion, followed by solid phase extraction (SPE) purification, chemical reduction by NaBH 4 , and SPE again for the removal of reductant.

            <p>The selection of studies, collection and analysis of data, and reporting of the results obtained, followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The Cochrane Q-statistic and the I2-statistic tests were used to assess heterogeneity among the studies whereby P 0.05 was considered statistically significant and P &gt; 0.05 was considered statistically insignificant. I2 described the total variation (due to heterogeneity rather than chance) across studies in terms of percentages whereby a value of 0% indicated no heterogeneity, and larger values especially from 50% and above indicated increasing heterogeneity. A fixed effect model was used if I2 was &lt;50% and a random effect model was used if I2 was &gt;50%. Funnel plots were assessed for publication bias. Oddratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for categorical variables. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e19cf83692-software-1">RevMan</rs> <rs corresp="#e19cf83692-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">5.3</rs> software was used for the statistical analysis. The authors had full access to and take full responsibility for the integrity of the data. All authors have read and agreed to the manuscript as written. Ethical approval was not required since this study is a systematic review and metaanalysis of RCTs. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows the flowchart of study selection. We identified 42 studies comparing SES with PES in patients with CAD. Thirteen studies were excluded (6 of them were metaanalysis and 7 were observational studies). Finally, 29 studies from 19 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria comprising of 16,724 patients (8115 patients in the SES group and 8609 patients in the PES group) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> reports the general features of all the 19 trials included in this meta-analysis. Features such as the number of participants involved in the SES group, number of participants involved in the PES group, the year of enrollment of patients for these trials, the follow-up periods as well as the Cochrane Bias Risk grade have been summarized in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> reports the baseline features of each of the included studies.

Briefly, a sequence was assigned to a species if the best matching reference sequence showed ≥ 98% homology and the next best matching reference species showed 0.8%, or less, sequence homology. A sequence was assigned to the genus level on the basis of 95% to 98% homology to the best matching sequence or ≥ 98% homology with sequence entries for several species from the same genus. 'No identification' was defined as &lt; 95% homology with the best matching reference sequence or a sequence homology &gt; 95% with various genera.

            <p>To determine whether E2-regulated signaling can counteract Nrf2 defective response induced by BRCA1 loss, we treated the E2-responsive human breast cancer cell line MCF7 with 17- estradiol (E2). As previously reported <ref type="bibr">(Dubik and Shiu, 1992)</ref>, c-MYC mRNA was up-regulated by 10 nM E2 treatment in MCF7 cells (not depicted). Interestingly, E2 stimulation led to significant NRF2 protein increase <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 A)</ref>, with no change in NRF2 mRNA expression <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 B)</ref>. E2 also induced NRF2-driven transactivation, as shown by <ref type="figure">3 and 4)</ref>, or 53bp1 shRNA (mice 5 and 6).

Untreated KB1 f/f cells showed undetectable Nrf2 levels that increased after 2-h treatment with E2 to a level similar to control B1 f/f cells but lower than 2-h E2-treated B1 f/f cells. This result shows that E2 may rescue compromised Nrf2 stabilization in the absence of BRCA1 to counteract ROS accumulation and promote cell survival.</p>

            <p>Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche). Quantitative PCR were performed using qPCR-SYBR-Green (Roche). Primers ordered from Biomers were designed using '<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="f30daf46d5-software-2">Universal Probe Library Assay Design Center</rs>' Software (<rs corresp="#f30daf46d5-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Roche</rs>). Primer sequences are given in Supplementary Table S2. Quantification of gene regulation was performed by the ÁÁCp method using RPL13 as house-keeping gene.</p>
            <p>We next wondered whether the same pharmacological inhibitors could influence the activity of the known BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter. Therefore, a reporter construct harboring the previously described 1500 bp BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter (34) was transiently transfected into Jurkat T cells, which were either left untreated or pre-treated with inhibitors for CN, NF-kB or p38 for 30 min before the stimulation with P/I. These experiments revealed that the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter is sensitive to all of the analysed inducers and inhibitors, similar to the octamer-dependent reporter <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>. To explore whether protein expression of BOB.1/OBF.1 mirrors its promoter activity, Jurkat T cells and primary CD4 + cells isolated from lymph nodes of C57BL/6 wild-type mice were either left untreated or pre-treated for 30 min with the inhibitors used in the previous experiments and subsequently stimulated with P/I. Interestingly, we found a striking coregulation of Oct2 and BOB.1/OBFInterestingly, EMSA studies (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>) revealed that the NF-kB inhibitor Bay11-7082 inhibits additionally NFAT binding to DNA and, vice versa, the CN inhibitors CsA and FK506 interfere with NFAT binding but also with the NF-kB signaling pathway, as it was described recently <ref type="bibr">(44,45)</ref>. Therefore, the observed effect of CsA and FK506 on BOB.1/OBF.1 expression is not only mediated by inhibiting NFAT activity, as these compounds also affect the activity of NF-kB, but rather by the combined activity of NFAT and NF-kB. However, treatment of murine primary CD4 + T cells or transfected Jurkat cells with specific NFAT and NF-kB signaling pathway inhibitors, like the NFAT inhibitory peptide 11 R-VIVIT and the NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO)-binding peptide, respectively, clearlyThe BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter contains several binding sites for NFAT and NF-iB Previously, the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter was analysed to identify regulatory elements responsible for its activity in B cells <ref type="bibr">(34-36)</ref>. In those studies, a functional cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/Activating Transcription Factor (ATF) site could be identified, which is crucial for the B lymphocyte specific activity of the promoter. In addition, a sequence related to a NFAT binding site was described, however without any functional relevance for the B cell-specific BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter activity. In search for possible additional transcription factor binding sites using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="f30daf46d5-software-simple-6">Genomatrix</rs> Software, we identified two combined NFAT/NF-kB binding sites within the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter. Both newly identified sites are conserved between rat, mouse and man, suggesting a possible functional relevance of these regulatory elements. In contrast to B cells, where a function of the predicted NFAT binding site has not been revealed <ref type="bibr">(34)</ref>, an inducible complex formation could be detected after P/I treatment of primary CD4 + T cells. This complex resembles that formed at the NFAT site of the IL2 promoter used in control experiments <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref> <ref type="figure">Figure S2)</ref>. Together, our data suggest that NFAT and NF-kB family members are able to bind to all of these newly identified potential cis-acting elements of the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter in vitro.</p>

            <p>To determine the extent of Nodal signaling more rigorously, 40%-50% epiboly Tg(ARE:eGFP) embryos were stained for eGFP, ndr1, ndr2, lft1, and lft2 expression, sectioned, and quantitated <ref type="figure">(Figures 3A and 3B)</ref>. The expression of eGFP, ndr1, ndr2, and lft1 was limited to an average of about five cell tiers, whereas lft2 expression was detected in only two to three cell tiers from the margin. To confirm that these findings were not due to a lack of sensitivity of the WISH, we analyzed the expression of sox3, which is repressed by Nodal signaling in the marginTo corroborate the data obtained from the sections, we used a direct readout of the Nodal pathway, fluorescent immunostaining of whole-mount 50% epiboly embryos with an antibody against P-Smad2. For comparison, we also stained for P-Erk. Nuclear P-Smad2 staining was observed exclusively in the margin and, as expected, in a smaller domain than the P-Erk staining <ref type="figure">(Figure 3C)</ref>. To quantitate the size of the P-Smad2-positive domain, we imaged the embryos at the margin, used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e21df93f04-software-simple-0">MetaMorph</rs> software to generate normalized nuclear staining intensities, and measured the distance of each nucleus from the margin in control-and SB-505124-treated embryos. P-Smad2 staining above background was found up to five to six cell tiers (80-90 mm) from the margin in a steep gradient, which was abolished in SB-505124-treated embryos <ref type="figure">(Figures 3D,</ref> 3E, and S5B-S5D). The staining was strongest in the nuclei of cells nearest the YSL. Taken together with our observations from the Tg(ARE:eGFP) reporter line, these data demonstrate that Nodal signaling occurs in five to six cell tiers from the margin, closely mirroring the expression of the ligands.</p>
            <p>Whole-Mount Immunofluorescence and Quantification of P-Smad2 Staining Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight, dehydrated to 100% methanol, and stored at À20 C until processing. For whole-mount immunofluorescence, embryos were rehydrated to PBS and incubated in cold acetone at À20 C for 20 min. Blocking and antibody incubations were performed in 10% FBS and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and washes were performed in PBS/1% Triton. The following primary antibodies were used: a-PSmad2/3 (8828; Cell Signaling Technology) and a-P-Erk (M8159; Sigma). Note that because of the lack of Smad3 at blastula stages, we solely detect P-Smad2 with the a-P-Smad2/3 antibody. DAPI was used to stain nuclei, and images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. For quantification of P-Smad2 intensity in deep cells, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e21df93f04-software-1">MetaMorph</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#e21df93f04-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>) was used to generate P-Smad2 to DAPI ratios from at least three single optical slices per embryo, in three individual DMSO or SB-505124 treated, 50% epiboly embryos. Care was taken not to select mitotic or overlapping nuclei or nuclei from the enveloping layer. To measure the distance of a nucleus to the margin, a line was drawn laterally at the vegetal edge of the margin, and the distance to the nucleus perpendicular to the margin was measured using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e21df93f04-software-simple-3">MetaMorph</rs> Software. To normalize the staining intensity for each embryo, the average ratio of an area further than 11 cell tiers from the margin (&gt;165 mm) was subtracted from each measurement. The data were divided in 15 mm bins, representing the average size of a deep cell at 50% epiboly (unpublished data; <ref type="bibr">Dubrulle et al., 2015)</ref>. The averages of the binned data for each cell tier, comparing DMSO and SB-505124 treatment, were used for testing for statistical significant differences using paired t tests with a 95% confidence interval.</p>

            <p>The experiments were carried out in a multi-chamber with ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system housing a SPECS variable temperature STM with a base pressure of less than 2 3 10 210 mbar. Si (111)-(7 3 7) surfaces were cleaned by degassing samples at , 600uC for 12 h and then flash annealing at , 1200uC with direct current sample heating for 15-30 s under UHV conditions.

            <p>To investigate the mechanism through which PKM2 regulates Bcl2, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed to validate their interaction. Immunoblotting analyses of immunoprecipitated Bcl2 with an anti-PKM2 antibody <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>A) or immunoprecipitated PKM2 with an anti-Bcl2 antibody (Supplementary information, <ref type="figure">Figure S</ref>2A) showed that endogenous PKM2 interacted with endogenous Bcl2 reciprocally, but not with succi-that stably express control shRNA (shNT) or shRNA against PKM2 (shPKM2) were treated with or without H 2 O 2 (0.5 mM, 24 h). The cells were harvested for apoptosis analysis using Annexin V-Cy5 Apoptosis Kit (A) or caspase 3 activity analysis (B). Data represent the means ± SD of three independent experiments. CON, control. (C) U87 or U251 cells with or without PKM2 depletion were treated with H 2 O 2 (0.5 mM, 24 h) and harvested for cytosolic (Cyto) and mitochondrial (Mito) fractionation. (D) U87 cells were treated with or without H 2 O 2 (0.5 mM, 1 h). Immunofluorescence analyses were performed using anti-PKM2 or anti-VDAC antibodies. Representative images were shown in left panel. Co-localization of two proteins in 300 cells was quantified using the software of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="c5932db765-software-1">Volocity</rs> (<rs corresp="#c5932db765-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">PerkinElmer</rs>, right <ref type="figure">(Figure 2B)</ref>. We also examined the interaction between PKM2 and Bcl2 under various treatments or in various types of tumor cells. TNFα or PTX could induce the interaction between PKM2 and Bcl2, whereas TMZ failed to do so (Supplementary information, <ref type="figure">Figure S</ref> PKM1 shares high homology with PKM2 in protein sequence, as they differ from each other in only one exon. PKM2 contains exon 10, whereas PKM1 contains exon 9 <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. To narrow searching range for Bcl2-interacting region on PKM2, we tested whether PKM1 interacts with Bcl2. U87 cells were infected with a lentivirus expressing Flag-tagged PKM2 (Flag-PKM2) or Flag-PKM1. Immunoblotting analyses of immunoprecipitated Flag-PKM2 or Flag-PKM1 with an anti-Bcl2 antibody showed that PKM1, unlike PKM2, did not interact with Bcl2 after H 2 O 2 treatment (Figure 2C), suggesting that PKM2 may interact with Bcl2 through the region encoded by exon 10 of PKM2. According to secondary structure of PKM2 exon 10, we constructed four S-Flag-Streptavidin-binding peptide (SFB)-tagged PKM2 mutants with the deletion of the indicated amino acid residues, including PKM2 Δ370-388, PKM2 Δ389-405, PKM2 Δ406-423 and PKM2 Δ424-435. Immunoblotting analyses of precipitated SFB-PKM2 proteins with anti-Bcl2 antibody showed that only PKM2 Δ389-405 failed to bind to Bcl2 among PKM2 mutants (Figure 2D). Bcl2 has been reported to interact with other proteins through hydrophobic or ionic bonds <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. According to amino acid properties, we constructed two PKM2 mutants, PKM2 ILLL, in which hydrophobic amino acids (isoleucine 389, leucine 392, leucine 394 and leucine 398) were mutated to alanine, and PKM2 EERR, in which ionic amino acids (glutamic acid 396, glutamic acid 397, arginine 399, and arginine 400) were mutated to alanine. Both PKM2 WT and PKM2 EERR interacted with Bcl2, whereas PKM2 ILLL failed to do soTo test the specificity of PKM2 ILLL mutation, we examined pyruvate kinase and protein kinase activities of PKM2 ILLL mutant. As shown in Supplementary information, <ref type="figure">Figure S</ref>2F, PKM2 ILLL has comparable pyruvate kinase activity to PKM2 WT. We further examined the glycolytic activities of the corresponding PKM2ILLL-reconstituted cells. The data showed that similar glucose consumption and lactate production were detected in both PKM2 WT-and ILLL-reconstituted U87 cells (Supplementary information, <ref type="figure">Figure S</ref>2G). We previously reported that PKM2 could phosphorylate Histone H3 at threonine (T) 11 <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>. Thus, we examined the phosphorylation of Histone H3 T11 by PKM2 WT or ILLL. The data showed that both PKM2 WT and ILLL could phosphorylate Histone H3 T11 at similar levels (Supplementary information, <ref type="figure">Figure S2H)</ref>. Together, these data suggested that PKM2 ILLL only lost the binding to Bcl2, but still reserved its pyruvate kinase and protein kinase activities.</p>

            <p>Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa (denoted as strain B75) and Xanthomonas translucens pv. translucens (denoted as strain B74) were incubated at 28 °C for 72 h on modified Wilbrink's media and a single colony was selected and grown in nutrient broth for 16 hours at 28 °C. An aqueous suspension of 10 9 colony-forming units ml -1 were inoculated by syringe infiltration on the flag leaf at the 3-leaf stage, and the plants were incubated in the greenhouse. Sterilized water was used as the negative control for inoculation treatments. The bacterial pathogen inoculation was done at 7 dpi with BSMV Era1 or BSMV 0 . In a pilot study, it was determined that the strains used exhibit a compatible interaction with wheat cv. UC1041 (data not shown). Seven days after inoculation with X. translucens, the leaf lesion area was quantified using digital image analysis using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e4ba643b00-software-0">ASSESS</rs> software (<rs corresp="#e4ba643b00-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">American Phytopathological Society</rs>, St. Paul, MN, USA). The experiment was arranged in a completely random design. There were 24 individual treatments (3 bacterial inoculants × 2 water stress conditions × 3 silencing types) and each of these treatments was replicated 24 times. Statistical analysis was carried out using the general linear model of the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e4ba643b00-software-1">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#e4ba643b00-software-1" resp="#annotator2" type="version">9.1</rs> statistical package (<rs corresp="#e4ba643b00-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC, USA).

            <p>Differences in age between healthy controls and patients were examined using twotailed Student's t test, and the 2 test was used to examine differences in gender distribution. For the case-control association study, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) testing of the SNPs was done using SNPAlyze V7.0 Pro (Dynacom, Chiba, Japan). The HWE tests were carried out for all loci in patients and controls. Differences in genotypic and allelic frequencies were evaluated based on the case-control design using 2 analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD), denoted as D ', was calculated from the haplotype frequency using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The LD block was also identified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a93bdc2ade-software-simple-0">SNPAlyse</rs> software when D ' was greater than 0.75. Case-control haplotype analysis was also performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a93bdc2ade-software-simple-1">SNPAlyse</rs> software. Permutation analysis was used to determine the empirical significance and to calculate the p values based on 10,000 replications. The global p values represent the overall significance using the 2 test when the observed versus expected frequencies of all haplotypes are considered together. Individual haplotypes were tested for association by grouping all other haplotypes together and applying the 2 test with 1 d.f. All p values reported are two-tailed. Statistical significance was defined at p ! 0.05.</p>
            <p>To analyze interactions between SNPs in PGBD1 and APOE genotypes, logistic regression analysis was performed using HealthSketch version 2.5 (Dynacom). The probability (P c ) of an individual being a case rather than a control is assumed to be affected by a set of SNPs, according to the logistic model. For example, logit(P) = b 0 + b 1 x 1 + b 2 x 2 for a single SNP. Here, we use a coding scheme x 1 = -1, 0, 1 and x 2 = -0.5, 0.5, -0.5 for genotypes homozygous for major alleles, heterozygous, and homozygous for minor alleles (for APOE , 4 was assumed to be the minor allele, and 2 and 3 were assumed to be major alleles simultaneously), respectively, to represent an additive effect with x 1 and a dominant/recessive effect with x 2 . The weights were estimated with the maximum likelihood method and tested by comparison with the null hypothesis logit(P c ) = b 0 (constant). We performed a stepwise forward selection procedure with two purposes: the first was to test the relationships among multiple SNPs in PGBD1 and the APOE genotype, and the second was to confirm the interaction among the SNPs if a significant association with p ! 0.05 was shown with individual logistic models. Multiple regression analyses were performed to estimate the relationship among the age of onset, APOE status, and the 4 SNPs using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a93bdc2ade-software-2">SPSS</rs> software ver. <rs corresp="#a93bdc2ade-software-2" resp="#annotator10" type="version">17.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#a93bdc2ade-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">IBM</rs>, Chicago, Ill., USA).</p>

Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the cohort. Surgery was used as the denominator for all the analyses as there were 38 women who had undergone two separate procedures as part of their treatment (repeat surgeries for complications were excluded). In addition, it was possible that age, comorbidity and ASA grade could change over time in an individual woman. All eligible surgeries were included to calculate the crude or unadjusted Intra-op complication rate (CR) and for the Post-op CR analysis was limited to those with both hospitaland patient-reported data. To assess how each potential predictor affected the CR individually, univariable logistic regressions were performed separately for all predictors. For Intra-op complications, the independent variables included age, the presence of comorbidities (yes/no), type of comorbidities, BMI (continuous variable and categorical-underweight, normal, overweight, obese and morbidly obese), ASA grade (1-4), previous abdominal surgery (yes/no), grade of operating surgeon (consultant, sub-specialty trainee, general obstetrics and gynaecology trainee), surgical approach (laparotomy/laparoscopy), surgical complexity (1-5) and final diagnosis (ovarian, uterine, cervix, vulva and benign). For Post-op complications, two additional variables-duration of surgery (in hours) and EBL (o500 mls, 500-1000 mls, 41000-2500 mls, 42500 mls) were included.</p>

            <p>We used data from the National Prescribing Service (NPS) MedicineWise (formerly NPS Medicines Line), operated by clinical pharmacists of Mater Health Services, Brisbane, between September 2002 and June 2010. This call centre was available to consumers Australia-wide for medicine-related questions. Since data from our observational study were originally routinely collected as part of a health service without specific a priori research goals, research was conducted and reported in accordance with the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) guideline, <ref type="bibr">17</ref> an extension of the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Details of each call were captured on a standardised form and entered into a <rs corresp="#adf2a3dbf5-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="adf2a3dbf5-software-0">Access</rs> database. These included demographics, enquiry type, relationship of caller to patient and motivation for calling. For each call, up to three generic medicines relating to the question were recorded and categorised by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system of medicines. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Of the five ATC levels, we examined medicine classes at the ATC3 level, which labels medicines according to their pharmacological subgroup (eg, antihistamines-systemic), as well as at the ATC5 level, which identifies the chemical substance (eg, chlorpheniramine). Caller location was identified by postal code and grouped by state/territory and Accessibility/ Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA), a measure of the remoteness of areas from service centres. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> The relative population ratio was determined by dividing percentage of paracetamol calls from each ARIA category by percentage of population living in each ARIA category. Narrative for calls between January 2009 and June 2010 were also recorded electronically. Calls involving paracetamol in the question were extracted for analysis. Remaining calls were classified as 'rest of calls'. We excluded calls that only involved a voicemail request for Consumer Medicines Information (CMI) leaflets.</p>
            <p>We conducted a retrospective quantitative analysis on all paracetamol-related calls. Comparisons between paracetamol and 'rest of calls' were performed using a χ 2 test for categorical data. Each call was originally coded for 1 of 25 enquiry types. These were collapsed into seven question categories: 'efficacy' (indications for use, medicine comparisons, effectiveness for specific conditions or symptoms); 'interaction'; 'other safety' (side effects or cautions for use), 'administration' (dose, administration, formulation or storage issues); safety in 'pregnancy and/or lactation'; 'logistics' (availability or cost) and 'miscellaneous'. Enquiry types were compared by patient age groups and other life stages, for example, during pregnancy or breast feeding. Concurrent medicines included in paracetamol calls were also compared by age groups and a special population, pregnant women. A two-sided p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant.

            <p>The HDL particle diameter was determined according to the method described by Perusse et al <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>, by gradient gel electrophoresis using 4 to 25% polyacrylamide. After the gels had been equilibrated at 120 V for 60 min, electrophoresis was performed for each gel containing the serum sample diluted 1:2 with sample buffer (consisting of 40% sucrose, 0.06% EDTA-2Na, and 0.01% BPP), to a volume of 20 µL. Each gel also contained thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, and lactate dehydrogenase as reference standards of known diameter. The gels were then electrophoresed at 15 V for 15 min, followed by migration at 70 V for 20 min, at 75 V for 16 h, and finally at 125 V for 8 h. The gels were then stained for lipid overnight with Sudan Black, and for reference standards with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 45 min. They were then decolorified with ethanol and kept immersed in acetic acid. The decolorified gels were then scanned with an image scanner (Epson GT-6500: Seiko Epson Corporation, Nagano, Japan) and analyzed using an image processing and analysis program for Macintosh (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="ad1ffa9646-software-0">NIH Image</rs> <rs corresp="#ad1ffa9646-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">1.61</rs>: <rs corresp="#ad1ffa9646-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>, United States). Migration distances were determined. The HDL particle diameter was then calculated by comparing the mobility of the sample with that of the three calibrated standards on each gel. A higher integrated HDL size indicated a greater proportion of "large" HDL particles, whereas a low HDL size suggested an increased prevalence of "small" HDL particles. Inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variation for the integrated HDL size assessed by this method were &lt; 3% (n=10) and &lt;2% (n=9), respectively.</p>

            <p>Microvessel areas (MVAs) in subcutaneous xenograft tumors were determined by light microscopy/optical image analysis after immunostaining xenograft tumor sections with anti-CD31 as described previously <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>.

            <p>Statistical analysis. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between regular low-UTI and frequency of UTI-ab and bladder cancer risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for the following, potentially confounding, factors: age at UBC diagnosis/at time of completing questionnaire (in years), smoking status (categorical variable: never smokers, former smokers, current smokers (i.e., those who had not stopped in the year prior to the year of UBC diagnosis (for patients) or filling out the questionnaire (for controls)), cumulative smoking exposure in terms of pack-years of cigarettes, use of aspirin and ibuprofen/ brufen (yes/no), and education (categorical variable). Additional analyses were conducted to determine whether the associations differed for non-muscle invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancer, age at onset of UTI (below or above sex-specific median age), menopausal state at onset UTI (using a threshold of 51 years as proxy), and smoking status (never vs ever). All analyses were stratified for gender. A (two-sided) P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

            <p>Mapping of sequencing reads and quantitative PCR. Sequencing reads were mapped using the software program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ae648e3baf-software-simple-0">MAQ</rs> (40) onto the published E. coli (NC_000913.2) and Salmonella Typhimurium (CP001363.1) genomes, allowing up to two mismatches per read. The number of reads mapped to each nucleotide position on each strand was obtained by parsing the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ae648e3baf-software-simple-1">MAQ</rs> pileup file using a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ae648e3baf-software-simple-2">custom Perl script</rs>, as previously described <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. The expression levels of genes were estimated by identifying the maximum number of reads that mapped to the sense and antisense strands of annotated open reading frames (ORFs). Background expression levels were calculated for 53 genes (see <ref type="table">Table S</ref>6 in the supplemental material) that were not expressed in a previous microarray-based study in exponential-phase E. coli in LB <ref type="bibr">(41)</ref>. Microarray data were downloaded from the Oklahoma University E. coli Gene Expression Database (http: //genexpdb.ou.edu/main/). Read depths for these genes ranged from 0 to 19. Based on these, we used a cutoff of 20 reads to designate an asRNA as expressed.</p>
            <p>Analysis of nucleotide sequence divergence and polymorphism. Patterns of nucleotide divergence and polymorphism were analyzed to infer whether promoter regions regulating asRNA expression are subject to functional constraint. To calculate levels of nucleotide sequence divergence, protein-coding gene sequences containing identified antisense TSSs were extracted from the genome sequence of either E. coli (NC_000913.2) or Salmonella (CP001363.1) and aligned with orthologous sequences from the other species. Codon-based nucleotide alignments were generated by aligning translated amino acid sequences using the software program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ae648e3baf-software-8">MUSCLE</rs> v<rs corresp="#ae648e3baf-software-8" resp="#annotator2" type="version">3.7</rs> and then converting them back to nucleotide sequences <ref type="bibr">(46)</ref>. Divergence values were calculated using third codon positions only, which are largely synonymous and thus less susceptible to selection acting on the sense-strand-encoded amino acid sequence. Alignment gaps were excluded from divergence estimates.</p>
            <p>To provide a basis of comparison for the patterns of nucleotide divergence and polymorphism observed in antisense promoter regions, we identified TSSs for a set of highly expressed protein-coding mRNAs (maximum read depth of at least 200) in E. coli and Salmonella (67 and 55 loci, respectively). For this set of control loci, we extracted gene sequences along with associated 5= regions extending 200 bp upstream of the identified TSS from the same sets of genomes described above. Nucleotide alignments were performed in <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ae648e3baf-software-simple-5">MUSCLE</rs>, and sequence divergence and polymorphism values were calculated as described above, except that there was no filtering based on codon position for upstream noncoding sequences. Genes with unalignable upstream regions were excluded from the analysis.</p>
            <p>For both interspecific and intraspecific comparisons, putative orthologs were identified as pairs of genes that returned top hits in reciprocal searches between a pair of genomes with <rs corresp="#ae648e3baf-software-10" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NCBI</rs> <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ae648e3baf-software-10">tBLASTn</rs> v<rs corresp="#ae648e3baf-software-10" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.2.24</rs> <ref type="bibr">(48)</ref>.

            <p>Retinal component layer thickness was measured for each group. In addition, we assessed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity (anti-GFAP polyclonal antibody; Dako, Cambridgeshire, U.K.). Immunoreactivity was assessed by confocal microscopy and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="dcb565048b-software-simple-0">ImageJ</rs> software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. GFAP-positive fibers in the Müller cells crossing the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and the inner nuclear layer (INL) were quantified. Analysis of retinal DNA damage and caspase-3. DNA damage in the retina was determined with a transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay using a kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Two retinal cryosection slides per animal were designated as negative controls, and one slide per animal was a positive control. The positive control slide was incubated in DNase 1 solution (200 mg/mL in PBS; Qiagen) for 10 min at room temperature while the rest were incubated in PBS (n = 6 per group). To aid in orientation of the retinal samples, the nuclear stain propidium iodide (PI; 5 mg/mL in PBS; Sigma) was used. Positive cell counts were assessed by image analysis in multiple sections. In addition, images were taken at three separate points on the central retina at 340 magnification and presented as the average nuclei in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) or in the entire retina. In total per animal, there were two positive slides (three fields at 300 mm 2 each), one negative slide (three fields), and one test slide (three fields) assessed (n = 6 per group of animals).</p>
            <p>OIR pathology assessment. One eye from each animal (n = 6) had retinal RNA isolated and qPCR conducted as outlined above. The fellow eye (n = 6) was enucleated and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (n = 6 per treatment group). Retinal flat mounts were stained with isolectin B4 (Sigma) and the corresponding streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen). Stained retinae were visualized and imaged using Nikon TE-2000 C1 confocal system.

            <p>We used single turnover kinetics experiments under saturating enzyme conditions ([E] &gt; [S] &gt;&gt; K d ) to obtain a rate constant (k max ) that is not influenced by product release or product inhibition. This is important because TDG exhibits very slow product release and strong product inhibition, which dominates k cat values determined using steady-state kinetics <ref type="bibr">(19,32,33)</ref>. Experiments were collected at room temperature (23 C) in HEMN.1 buffer (0.02 M HEPES, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 M NaCl). Experiments were initiated by adding concentrated TDG to buffered substrate, followed by rapid mixing. At various time points, aliquots were removed, quenched with 50% (v:v) 0.3 M NaOH and 0.03 M EDTA, and heated at 85 C for 15 min to cleave the DNA backbone at enzyme-produced abasic sites. The fraction product was determined by HPLC <ref type="bibr">(21,24)</ref>. The data were fitted to Equation (1) using nonlinear regression with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator16" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-simple-0">Grafit</rs> 6 (34):</p>
            <p>We also determined the maximal rate of product formation using kinetics experiments as described above, but with saturating substrate conditions ([S] &gt;&gt; K d , and [S] &gt;&gt; [E]) <ref type="bibr">(22,33)</ref>.

            <p>The equilibrium dissociation constants for TDG binding to TR-labeled DNA were determined by fitting the fluorescence anisotropy data to appropriate models using<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-5">DynaFit</rs> <rs corresp="#fe862776bc-software-5" resp="#annotator5" type="version">4</rs> <ref type="bibr">(38,39)</ref>. The models and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-simple-5">DynaFit</rs> scripts used for data fitting are given in the Supplementary Data. The fitted parameters included dissociation constants for one or two binding sites on the DNA, and anisotropy values for free DNA (r D ) and for 1:1 and 2:1 complexes with TDG (r ED and r EED ). In many cases, the data clearly indicate two nonequivalent binding sites. Model discrimination was also informed by the probability value of the Fisher's F-statistic, obtained from data fitting, where P &lt; 0.05 is considered significant. The reported parameters are derived from global fitting of at least two independent binding experiments. We determined the equilibrium dissociation constant for TDG binding to unlabeled DNA using equilibrium competition anisotropy experiments, where TDG binding to TR-labeled 16U F 11 was monitored in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled DNA.<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-simple-6">DynaFit</rs> was used for global fitting of the data to a model involving one or two TDG binding sites for the unlabeled DNA and two binding sites for TR-labeled 16U F 11. A benefit of using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-simple-7">DynaFit</rs> for the data presented here is that data fitting does not require an analytical equation, which could involve assumptions that are not compatible with experimental restraints. Indeed, the standard model for two nonequivalent binding sites assumes the species being monitored (DNA) is present at much lower concentration than the dissociation constant. This is not feasible for monitoring TDG binding to 16U F 11, because the minimal DNA concentration needed for sufficient sensitivity in the anisotropy experiment (0.5 nM) approximates the dissociation constant (K d1 = 0.6 nM, see below).</p>

Tests were two-sided and adjusted for variance inequality where appropriate. Linear regression with Pearson's correlation test was used to determine the covariant relationships between data. Normal distribution of the data was confirmed by comparing against expected normal distributions with given means and standard deviation. In all cases, test probability values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Greater serum phosphate, creatinine, and cystatin C levels suggest that 5/6 nephrectomy induced kidney failure, which in turn promotes inflammation. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Osteogenic activity in mouse arteries and aortic valves associate with each other and increase with atherosclerosis severity</p>

The same model with the addition of the covariate baseline FPG was used to assess changes in FPG from baseline to week 24. The reductions in HbA 1c within the linagliptin group were stratified into quartiles based on the change from baseline to week 24: ,0.1, 0.120.59, 0.6020.99, and $1.0% (,1.1, 1.126.5, 6.6210.8, and $10.9 mmol/mol). Effects on SBP after treatment within the linagliptin group were stratified into three categories based on the change from baseline to the last value on treatment: SBP decrease of .1.0 mmHg, stable SBP with only minimal changes between 21.0 and 11.0 mmHg, and SBP increase of .1.0 mmHg. The difference between percentage changes in geometric mean UACR across HbA 1c quartiles and SBP categories was tested using an ANOVA F-test to determine whether they were statistically significantly different.

            <p>Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure were measured with a noninvasive tail-cuff system (Softron BP-98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Hemodynamic measurement. Rats under deep anesthesia underwent hemodynamic measurement. A fluid-filled catheter was advanced from the right carotid artery into the LV, and the left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was measured. Histology and morphometric analysis. Paraformaldehyde (4%)-fixed hearts were bisected transversely at the midventricular level, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-mm sections. A single myocyte was measured with images captured from hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. The myocyte crosssectional area was assessed under 3400 magnification within the LV, and a mean was obtained by quantitative morphometry with automated image analysis (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator28" type="software" xml:id="ac88aac71e-software-2">Image-Pro Plus</rs>, Version <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-2" resp="#annotator28" type="version">5.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Media Cybernatics</rs>, Houston, TX).</p>
            <p>Dark green-stained collagen fibers were quantified as a measure of fibrosis in Masson trichrome-stained sections. The collagen volume fraction (CVF) and perivascular collagen area/luminal area (PVCA/LA) were analyzed by quantitative morphometry with automated image analysis (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator28" type="software" xml:id="ac88aac71e-software-3">Image-Pro Plus</rs>, Version <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-3" resp="#annotator28" type="version">5.0</rs>). CVF was calculated as reported previously <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>. Perivascular collagen was excluded from the CVF measurement. To normalize the PVCA around vessels with different sizes, the perivascular collagen content was represented as the PVCA-to-LA ratio.</p>
            <p>Myocardial frozen sections (5 mm) were stained with Oil Red O (Sigma) for 10 min, washed, and then counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s. A Nikon microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) was used to capture the Oil Red O-stained tissue sections. Hydroxyproline analysis. The collagen content of myocardial tissue was determined by hydroxyproline assay <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. Tissue hydrolysate was detected by use of an ELISA kit (F15649; Westang Bio-Tech, Shanghai, China). Data were expressed as micrograms collagen per milligram dry weight, with the assumption that collagen contains an average of 13.5% hydroxyproline <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>. Immunohistochemical staining. Paraffin sections underwent immunohistochemistry by a microwave-based antigen retrieval method. The sections were incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-collagen I, anti-collagen III, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and anti-interleukin (IL)-6 antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight and then with a matching biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min at 37°C. Negative controls were omission of the primary antibody. The stained sections were developed with diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. The results were viewed under a confocal FV 1000 SPD laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Japan). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared with the TRIzol reagent (Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RT-PCR was performed using the following primers: b-actin, forward 59-AGA CCT TCA ACA CCC CAG-39 and reverse 59-CAC GAT TTC CCT CTC AGC-39; brain natriuretic protein, forward 59-GGG CTG TGA CGG GCT GAG GTT-39 and reverse 59-AGT TTG TGC TGG AAG ATA AGA3-9; TRB3, forward 59-TGA TGC TGT CTG GAT GAC AA-39 and reverse 59-GTG AAT GGG GAC TTT GGT CT-39; TNF-a, forward 59-CAC GCT CTT CTG TCT ACT GA-39 and reverse 59-GGA CTC CGT GAT GTC TAA GT-39; and IL-6, forward 59-ACC ACT TCA CAA GTC GGA GG-39 and reverse 592ACA GTG CAT CAT CGC TGT TC-39. Reactions were carried out on a real-time PCR thermocycler (IQ5 Real-Time PCR cycler; Bio-Rad), using SYBR green as fluorescence dye. Relative expression analysis involved the 2 2 △△CT method. Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was as described previously <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. We used antibodies against TRB3 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), collagen I, collagen III, TNF-a, IL-6 (Abcam), phospho (p)-extracellular signal-regulated, followed by anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. TRB3, collagen I, collagen III, TNF-a, and IL-6 protein levels were normalized to that of b-actin as an internal control and phosphospecific proteins to that of total protein. Gene silencing of TRB3. Sixty rats were randomized to receive TRB3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or vehicle treatment. Gene silencing occurred immediately after the appearance of LV diastolic dysfunction. After 12 weeks of diabetes, both E/A and E9/A9 were ,1.0 as assessed by echocardiography in diabetic rats. Animals were then injected via the jugular vein with 2.5 3 10 10 plaque-forming units of an adenovirus harboring TRB3 gene (TRB3-siRNA) or a control empty virus (vehicle). Adenovirus transfer was repeated in 2 weeks. According to our present and previous studies (23), TRB3 level was increased in HF diet-fed and high fructose-fed rats. Previous studies have shown that insulin resistance was a hallmark of obesity <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref> and metabolic syndrome <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. In light of the interaction between TRB3 and insulin resistance, we also investigated the effect of TRB3-siRNA on HF diet-induced cardiac injury. Four weeks after the first adenovirus injection, rats were killed. The heart was excised and weighed. Statistical analysis. Values are presented as mean 6 SEM. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator28" type="software" xml:id="ac88aac71e-software-4">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-4" resp="#annotator28" type="version">16.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS</rs>, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. Results were compared by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey-Kramer post hoc test and independent samples t test. A P , 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

            <p>Cell proliferation was examined by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Briefly, the cell lines were plated in 96-well plates (3,000 per well), and allowed to grow for 24, 48, and 72 hours, then assessed by a colorimetric assay using MTT solution (10 mg/mL) at 570 nm. Cell invasion ability assay was performed using transwell invasion chambers coated with matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Cells were suspended in FBS-free medium and added to the upper chamber, while the medium containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber. After 24 hours of incubation, the cells remaining on the upper membrane were removed with cotton wool, whereas the cells that had invaded through the membrane were stained with methanol and 0.1% crystal violet, imaged, and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cell migration ability was assessed by performing wound healing assays. Cells were cultured to 100% confluence, and wounds were generated using pipette tips. The cells were then cultured for 24 or 48 hours and the wound closure was assessed by <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b707545bfd-software-0">Scion Image Software</rs> (Scion Image

Experimental data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was analyzed using Student's t-test. The correlation between miR-381 and Twist1 expression was analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis. P,0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
            <p>To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying inhibitory effects of miR-381 on proliferation, invasion, and migration of CRC cells, we predicted potential targets of miR-381. Using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b707545bfd-software-simple-6">TargetScan</rs> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b707545bfd-software-simple-7">miRanda</rs> tools online, we screened several invasion-and migration-related genes by RTq-PCR, of which Twist1 expression was significantly repressed in miR-381 expressing HT29 and SW480 cells. In addition, Twist1 is an important inducer of EMT, which is involved in cell invasion and migration ability, <ref type="bibr">24,25</ref> and hence we focused on Twist1 in the study. To validate if miR-381 directly targets Twist1 3′UTR <ref type="figure">(Figure 3A)</ref>, luciferase reporter assays were performed in HT29 and SW480 cells, which revealed that miR-381 mimics significantly decreased the luciferase activity of wild-type Twist1 3′UTR reporter, but had no effect on the Twist1 3′UTR reporter with mutant miR-381 binding seed sites <ref type="figure">(Figure 3B)</ref>. RTq-PCR and Western blot also validated that miR-381 mimics reduced Twist1 expression, and miR-381 inhibitor mimics increased Twist1 expression in HT29 and SW480 cells <ref type="figure">(Figure 3C and D)</ref>. Moreover, RTq-PCR analysis revealed that Twist1 expression was significantly increased in CRC tumors compared with paired normal mucosal tissue (Figure 3E) and inversely correlated with the expression levels of miR-381 in CRC tissues used in the study <ref type="figure">(Figure 3F)</ref>. Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-381 directly inhibits Twist1 expression in CRC cells.</p>

Inductive analysis was undertaken for an emerging theme that was not anticipated at the outset and not included among the 17 dimensions of care covered in the topic guide. The data were coded by S.A. and verified by the co-authors through the reading and re-reading of the quotes. A code book was developed based on recurring pre-identified themes and emerging themes. Reliability of the coded data was verified through discussions of inconsistent codes among co-authors until agreement was reached.</p>

            <p>The lack of methods for tracking cells in 3D has been reported as a limiting factor, for instance in the context of immunoimaging <ref type="bibr">(Cahalan and Parker, 2008)</ref>. Despite the well-established protocol to capture microglia, innate immune cells in the central nervous system, in 3D using two-photon microscopy following the seminal works by <ref type="bibr">Nimmerjahn et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Davalos et al. (2005)</ref>, motility analysis has been performed by (and limited to) manual estimations derived from 2D projections <ref type="bibr">(Davalos et al., 2008)</ref> in the numerous studies following these protocols. In fact, tracking microglia cells is complicated by several aspects. Microglia tightly contact specific brain structures in their resting state <ref type="bibr">(Wake et al., 2009)</ref>, often making it difficult to clearly separate them from their surroundingWhile the red cell remains in resting state, the green cell is activated through an induced injury and migrates along a trajectory (orange line, trajectory obtained by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-0">ct3d</rs>; blue line, trajectory obtained from manual annotation) toward a site of injury (purple dot); see Supplementary Video 1 for a rendered animation of the same data.</p>
            <p>We implemented our algorithm in the publicly available <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-1">ct3d</rs> software package, which is accompanied by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-2">at3d</rs> graphical user interface. In terms of applying our algorithm, this article focuses on evaluating the performance of our cosegmentation-based approach for 3D cell tracking, leaving colocalization studies as a future direction. Cell tracking performance is evaluated both on two-photon live cell imaging data displaying zebrafish microglia in vivo, and on synthetically generated data that allow to determine the algorithm's accuracy based on the ground truth the synthetic data were generated from.</p>
            <p>Filtering results: as for most segmentation and tracking approaches, the results obtained from the steps described above has a tendency toward overdetection, i.e. detecting segments that result from image noise rather than cells. To filter out those segments, we utilize life span filtering, i.e. we filter out all cells whose identity can be traced across less than a certain minimum number of frames. This cell filter, along with several other ways to eliminate cells with unsuitable size or volume features, follows corresponding features of the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-3">Celltrack</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(Sacan et al., 2008)</ref> for 2D cell tracking; for<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-4">ct3d</rs>, they are implemented in the graphical user interface of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-5">at3d</rs> tool shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.</p>
            <p>• Alternative matching schemes: one class of cell tracking approaches is based on computing bipartite matchings between segmentations of individual time frames. As bipartite matchings may not capture events such as cell division or cell fusion, recent works such as <ref type="bibr">Padfield et al. (2009)</ref> introduced alternative matching schemes that are more flexible. Truly generalizing bipartite matchings, tree assignments can be seen as such alternative matching scheme. They are particularly interesting for cell tracking, as they may capture events such as cell division, cell fusion or cells entering the scene. See Supplementary Video 4 for synthetic data displaying a simplistic simulation of a cell division tracked by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-6">ct3d</rs>.</p>
            <p>We implemented component trees, tree-assignments and the complete cell tracking algorithm, in C++ using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-3">lp_solve</rs> <rs corresp="#b27b28bf20-software-3" resp="#curator" type="version">1</rs> for solving both the tree assignment and the weighted bipartite matching (integer) linear programs, all of which is compiled in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-9">ct3d</rs> command line tool. Cell tracking results can be further explored using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-10">at3d</rs>, which allows the user to select and extract specific cells identified by the cell tracking procedure, and derive their motility parameters such as velocity and deformation. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-11">at3d</rs> tool is implemented using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-12">qt</rs> framework for graphical user interfaces. Input and output of image series is designed to be compatible with other visualization software, most notably <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-13">v3d</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Peng et al., 2010)</ref> for producing rendered visualizations of the output.</p>
            <p>We evaluated our algorithm on two types of data. First, we applied it to an in vivo time-lapse sequence of 3D two-photon images of zebrafish midbrain, displaying the motility of microglia; second, we applied <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-14">ct3d</rs> to synthetically generated data for quantifying the accuracy of our cell tracking results.</p>
            <p>Evalutation on in vivo data was accomplished by comparison with manually annotated trajectories of specific microglia in three datasets. Note that manual annotation is limited to trajectories, whereas boundaries of the cell volumes are almost impossible to obtain in 3D, beside systematic problems with manual annotations <ref type="bibr">(Huth et al., 2010)</ref>. Hence, we additionally created synthetic ground truth data to further evaluate the performance of our method. We followed the procedure used in <ref type="bibr">Dufour et al. (2005)</ref>, generating (noise perturbed) elliptical objects of average intensity I o above Poisson distributed background noise of intensity I b . In addition to the procedure from <ref type="bibr">Dufour et al. (2005)</ref>, we created perturbed images with different types of background inhomogeneities, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: in a second set of data, we introduced a multiplicative vignetting effect to the data, following the vignetting model by <ref type="bibr">Kang and Weiss (2000)</ref> under different focal lengths f and off-axis illumination parameters α. In a third set of data, we introduced an additive linear gradient along the x-axis of different slopes β. Each time series consists of 20 time frames, each of size 200×200×40 pixels. On these data, we ran <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-15">ct3d</rs> with size cutoffs θ min = 500 and θ max = 5000, and a single-node cutoff of 200 pixels. In the resulting sequences, all cells whose identity could be traced through the complete sequence were kept, while all other cells were discarded using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-16">at3d</rs> tool.</p>
            <p>Our results on the synthetically generated image sequences are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and indicate that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-17">ct3d</rs> is highly robust against different types and intensities of background inhomogeneities. The results suggest that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-18">ct3d</rs> has a tendency to identify components slightly (about 10%) larger than the actual objects, as can also be seen in the sample output in Supplementary Video 3. This is a natural consequence of pruning the component trees, where the vertex that would perfectly represent an object is unlikely to be part of the pruned tree. This effect can be reduced by smaller choice for the single-node cutoff parameter σ at the cost of higher computation time.</p>
            <p>Running times varied between roughly 4 and 6 min, with an average of 303.42 s, for completely tracking one dataset. The <ref type="bibr">(Kang and Weiss, 2000)</ref>. The dashed box indicates the position of the 1D section displayed in the lower part. Right: same setting with the background perturbed by an additive linear gradient. In both instances, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-19">ct3d</rs> yields reliable tracking results (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). majority of running time was spent on constructing the component trees and computing the overlap weights (14.23 s on average per time frame), whereas each tree assignment required less than one second on average; the pruned component trees typically comprised a few dozens of vertices.</p>
            <p>As a reference algorithm to compare against the performance of<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-20">ct3d</rs>, we computed a segmentation of each time frame using the active contour approach by <ref type="bibr">Chan and Vese (2001)</ref>, 2 which is a wellestablished and state-of-the-art representative of the large family of level set methods. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, this method works highly accurate in the absence of background inhomogeneity while getting less reliable with increasing levels of background inhomogeneity, as can be expected due to the involvement of a global background model. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows a result obtained from our tracking algorithm on a time series of microglia images measured as described above. We reduced resolution by half, so that the resulting width and height varied between 146 and 250 pixels, while the depth ranged between 14 and 66 layers for each time frame; each time series comprised 30-80 time frames. Gray scale resolution was reduced from 16 bit to 8 bit. We applied <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-21">ct3d</rs> using parameters θ min = 200, θ max = 10 000 and a single-node cutoff of 200 pixels; the resulting pruned component trees contained 69 vertices on average, ranging between 40 and 168 vertices. Running times varied between roughly 2 and 10 min, with 471 s on average.</p>
            <p>Under the given experimental protocol, the phenomenon of overdetection, i.e. the recognition of segments that are not microglia, is inevitable. This is due to the limited specificity of the apoE-GFP gene, which is also expressed in cells other than microglia in the surrounding tissue, often at comparably high levels as in microglia. Yet, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-22">ct3d</rs> identifies microglia as segments that can be visually distinguished from non-microglia segments by a human observer due to their characteristic shape or motion patterns. The <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-23">Ct3d</rs> graphical user interface of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-24">at3d</rs> tool (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>) allows to manually eliminate false positive cells from tracking results by different filtering and visual selection functions similar to those provided by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-25">Celltrack</rs> for 2D time-lapse sequences. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-26">at3d</rs> tool also allows to manually correct for the occasionally observed events of oversegmentation, i.e. one microglia being recognized as two segments. We used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-27">at3d</rs> to eliminate non-microglia from all six datasets and correct oversegmentation in individual frames. We were able to reconstruct trajectories of all relevant microglia that can be visually identified in the original datasets; only one dataset was affected by a sudden 'frameshift', i.e. the sample changing its distance to the camera in the z direction, leading to interrupted trajectories at the corresponding time frame. In few other cases, the trajectory of a microglia was interrupted in individual frames, which we could correct using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-28">at3d</rs>. Examples of the final results are given in Supplementary Videos 1 and 2.</p>
            <p>In order to quantitatively evaluate the quality of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-29">ct3d</rs> results on in vivo microglia data, we compared <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-30">ct3d</rs> trajectories with manual annotations. To this end, we selected four microglia from four different datasets and annotated their trajectories manually using the 3D polyline markup feature of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-31">v3d</rs> software. The root mean square distance between the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-32">ct3d</rs> and the manual trajectories turned out to be 2.9 voxels, 5.5 voxels, 2.6 voxels and 5.4 voxels, respectively, in the four different datasets. These deviations can be considered relatively small in relation to the cell diameters, which were measured as 22.8, 22, 19.6 and 44.3 voxels, respectively.</p>
            <p>We have presented a novel approach to tracking cells in 3D time-lapse microscopy image sequences, based on the concepts of component trees and cosegmentation. We demonstrate that this approach is robust against the numerous challenges imposed by images measured in an in vivo environment, and allows to identify microglia and their motion patterns in zebrafish neural tissue when combined with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-33">at3d</rs> annotation tool. In a quantitative evaluation, we show that our approach is robust against different types of background inhomogeneities. This suggests that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-34">ct3d</rs> and<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-35">at3d</rs> are potentially useful for in vivo imaging studies investigating other aspects than just microglia motility. In its current formulation, our cosegmentation approach relies on the assumption that the area occupied by an object overlaps between two consecutive time points. While this may not be satisfied in all cell tracking problems [e.g. when tracking centrosomes <ref type="bibr">(Jaensch et al., 2010)</ref>], it is a reasonable assumption for many immunoimaging-related studies.</p>
            <p>To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that can identify and track microglia in live cell imaging time series. In most cases, obtaining reliable trajectories still requires manual post-processing of the output. The most notorious difficulties certainly are the complex morphology-their deformation patterns, irregular shapes and interaction with the surrounding-as well as the unspecificity of the fluorescent markers available. In this light, our approach constitutes significant progress in the sense that it has sufficient sensitivity to separate microglia form their surrounding. Yet, a fully automated approach remains a major and certainly non-trivial challenge. A first step in this direction might be the combination with level-set based approaches as utilized for 2D cellBottom: quantitative comparison of trajectories obtained by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-36">ct3d</rs> and the active contour approach from <ref type="bibr">Chan and Vese (2001)</ref>. In general, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-37">ct3d</rs> could identify the annotated cells in all time frames (columns # Frames). The root mean square distance to the annotated trajectory measures a fraction of the diameter of the annotated cell (columns cell and RMS), while the Chan-Vese algorithm missed varying numbers of cells or failed completely (last column). For the Chan-Vese results, a parameter set was optimized for dataset (a). This parameter set (µ = 1, ν = .5, λ 1 = .2, λ 2 = 5) was also applied to datasets (b) to (d). While for dataset (a), the result is comparable to <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-38">ct3d</rs>, the annotated cell was identified in only 29 out of 49 time frames in (b). In datasets (c) and (d), the annotated cell could not be identified at all using these parameters. See Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> tracking by <ref type="bibr">Nath et al. (2006)</ref> that might yield more accurate cell boundaries in some cases. Yet, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-39">ct3d</rs> promises to be a key tool for further studying open questions regarding microglia, such as to determine if and how glia and microglia share the task of finding and removing apoptotic neurons from the vertebrate brain <ref type="bibr">(Peri and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2008)</ref>.</p>

            <p>A series of cryogenic experiments was performed at the Janus Laser Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a schematic of which is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. A drive laser was focused onto a cryogenic target, launching a shock wave into liquid deuterium at an initial density r 0 ¼ 0.17 ± 0.004 g cm À 3 . A second laser, incident on a Si 3 N 4 foil fixed to the target at an intensity of 1 Â 10 14 W cm À 2 and wavelength of 527 nm, created an intense x-ray source by pumping the 2 keV Ly-a line in SiThe copper target is held at 19 K, liquefying the deuterium that is filled into the central cavity. A drive laser is incident on a 2-mm-diameter Al pusher, launching a shock wave along the axis. A probe laser irradiates a Si 3 N 4 foil, pumping the 2,005 eV Si Ly-a transition. X-rays scattered in the forward and backward directions are spectrally dispersed with highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) crystals whose direct view of the laser-plasma is prevented by Ni shields. (b) Cross section of the target reservoir across the thickness of the target. The target is sealed with aluminium on the front surface and a transparent quartz rear window to allow the VISAR beam to probe shock evolution. (c) Schematic of laser beam timing showing the shock drive beam (red) of 2-6 ns preceding a 2-ns probe pulse. The probe is delayed by 10-20 ns, depending on drive intensity, to allow the shock front to advance into the x-ray spectrometer view. Shorter delay times yielded higher shock pressures. (d) <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b6efcb6856-software-simple-0">HYDRA</rs> simulations of mass density evolving as a function of space and time, with a lineout at the x-ray probe time of 20 ns. The compressed D 2 peak (r Shock ¼ 0.54 g cm À 3 ) has traversed into the spectrometer field of view at t ¼ 20 ns when we make the x-ray measurement. The high-density peak lagging the D 2 shock front is due to the aluminium pusher, but is shielded by the x-ray window.These photons were collimated through a 400-mm-diameter aperture in the target, timed to probe the shock as it reached the x-ray collection ports. The x-rays were scattered from the shock front and collected through 400 mm ports at 45°and 135°from the incident photons. The probe pulse was delayed 10-20 ns after the rise of the drive beam, allowing the shock to traverse a distance of 350 mm to reach the volume accessed by the x-ray diagnostic port. The fields of view of the spectrometers were shielded with Ni-coated cones (40°opening angle) from ambient x-ray emission and stray light from both laser beams. The radiation was collected and spectrally dispersed with highly ordered pyrolytic graphite crystal spectrometers <ref type="bibr">35</ref> curved at a 107-mm radius. The drive laser beam used a phase plate to produce a round 600-mm-diameter spot on target. The forward scattering measurements were made on deuterium shock-driven by a frequency-doubled 2-ns-long laser pulse producing a wavelength of 527 nm at the target. The backscattering measurements were made operating the same laser at the 1,054 nm fundamental. These shots used 4 ns drive pulses at moderate compression and 6 ns at higher compression, all at nominal intensities of 4 Â 10 13 W cm À 2 .</p>
            <p>To determine the mass density-and hence compression r/r 0 -of the target using measured shock velocity, one of two approaches is necessary. Impedance matching techniques can be used to determine particle velocity in addition to shock velocity, closing the Rankine-Hugoniot relations <ref type="bibr">38-40</ref> and directly constraining state variables in the target. Alternatively, existing theoretical models or measured EOS values can be used to calculate compression from the shock velocity measured with VISAR; that is the approach used in this study. While one of several modern EOS models could be effectively used, we have chosen the quotidian EOS (ref. 41) because of its computational efficiency and the fact that it represents a middle ground between popular EOS models in the pressure regime of interest. Because we rely on an EOS that is not perfectly known, this approach requires careful accounting for that uncertainty in our inferred compression. Hicks et al. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> gave a comparison of both calculated and measured EOS values and their associated experimental uncertainties. For our experimental conditions, variations in EOS models are relatively small; near 15 GPa, where we observe the onset of ionization, models vary by about 10% in compression at a given pressure <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 2</ref> and Supplementary Methods). This uncertainty is included in the error bar of quoted values of mass density. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows a VISAR streak record along with the extracted shock velocities for high-power laser drive conditions. Also shown are simulation results from <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b6efcb6856-software-simple-1">HYDRA</rs>, a radiationhydrodynamics code widely used for modelling inertial confinement fusion and laser-plasma experiments <ref type="bibr">43</ref>. <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b6efcb6856-software-simple-2">HYDRA</rs> accurately reproduces the measured late-time shock velocities when scattering is performed. Stray light from the drive beam is visible for 2 ns early in the streak. Shock breakout from the Al pusher into D 2 occurs near the end of the drive beam where a discontinuous fringe shift is visible. As the shock decays, a drop in signal amplitude is visible in the raw data, since reflectivity falls as shock pressure and ionization decrease. The peak velocity immediately following shock breakout from the pusher is 22 km s À 1 with pressures near 50 GPa, which decays to 14 ± 1 km s À 1 and 15 þ 3.5/ À 4.5 GPa at 21 ns, the centre of the 2-ns-long x-ray probe.</p>
            <p>At the higher drive condition, a downshifted plasmon feature is visible centred at 1,998 eV below the probe energy of E 0 ¼ 2,005 eV. The plasmon resonance in this low-temperature regime experiences very little damping and is therefore quite narrow. The presented fit curves include broadening due to collisional effects calculated in the local-field-corrected Born-Mermin approximation, which goes beyond the random phase approximation to the dynamical structure factor by including electron-electron interactions and electron-ion collisions in the Born approximation <ref type="bibr">27,44</ref>. The spectrum is convolvedwith the instrument function introduced by the highly ordered pyrolytic graphite crystal and detector. The broad low-energy tail may be explained by bound-free transitions, whose fit includes density-and temperature-dependent continuum lowering. A best fit to the data indicates a delocalized electron density of n e ¼ 2.5 ± 0.4 Â 10 22 cm À 3 due to the free-electron densitysensitive plasmon shift at 7 eV. Combined with the mass density inferred from the VISAR trace, this corresponds to an average ionization state of Z ¼ 0.15 ± 0.04. The measured electron density corresponds to a Fermi temperature of T F ¼ 3.1 eV. For typical temperatures of a fraction of an electron volt, the electrons are therefore strongly degenerate, with y¼kT=e F $ 0:1, and a scattering parameter of a ¼ 1.5. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the 135°backscattered spectrum from another shot using a 4-ns laser drive, and a probe beam delay of 15 ns. <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b6efcb6856-software-simple-3">HYDRA</rs> calculations using an intensity profile matched to the velocity measurements shown above predict pressures of 16 GPa and compressions of 3.2 þ 0.2/ À 0.4, producing target conditions very close to those achieved in the plasmon scattering case. The ratio of elastic to inelastic scattering is strongly dependent on the ionization of the target; with increasing average ionization, the inelastic scattering contribution from free electrons grows relative to the remaining elastic signal. Fits are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5a for ionizations Z ¼ 0.1-0.5</ref> and a best fit is achieved for n e ¼ 2.4 Â 10 22 cm À 3 . This corresponds Z ¼ 0.15±0.08, in good agreement with the plasmon data. At these conditions, the scattering parameter is a ¼ 0.63.</p>

            <p>A classical method for constructing a multiple alignment aligns sequences progressively, as exemplified by the program<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-0">ClustalW</rs> <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>. Guided by a tree or a dendrogram that reflects the similarities among sequences, a progressive method makes a series of pairwise alignments for neighboring sequences or pre-aligned sequence groups. In this way, similar sequences are aligned prior to divergent sequences. However, progressive methods do not correct errors made in each pairwise alignment step. While similar sequences can be aligned with acceptable quality, progressive methods using general amino acid substitution matrices have limited success in obtaining high-quality alignments for divergent sequences <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Two main techniques are utilized to correct or minimize mistakes made in the progressive alignment process. One is iterative refinement of the alignment after the progressive steps <ref type="bibr">(9-11)</ref>, e.g. by repeatedly dividing the aligned sequences into two groups and realigning the groups. The other technique, pioneered by the program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-1">T-COFFEE</rs> <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>, makes a consistency measure among a set of pairwise sequence alignments before the progressive alignment steps.

            <p>Improving pairwise sequence alignments is a key to provide high-quality starting materials for a consistency measure. The most common technique of constructing a protein pairwise alignment utilizes a substitution matrix of amino acids and a dynamic programming algorithm with gap penalties <ref type="bibr">(13,14)</ref>. Commonly used substitution matrices, such as the BLOSUM or PAM series matrices <ref type="bibr">(15,16)</ref> are derived from large-scale analysis of relatively similar sequences. Other matrices have been derived from distant homologs based on structural alignments <ref type="bibr">(17,18)</ref>, and they are more suitable for aligning divergent sequences. Several studies have also shown that real or predicted local structural information can be used to improve pairwise alignment quality <ref type="bibr">(19,20)</ref>.Another approach to constructing a pairwise alignment relies on a hidden Markov model (HMM) <ref type="bibr">(21,22)</ref>. In a simple HMM for global pairwise alignment, aligned residue pairs are modeled by a hidden match state, while insertions and deletions are modeled by two hidden states that generate unmatched residues in either of the two sequences <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. In addition to being able to find an optimal alignment, a pairwise alignment HMM can be used to estimate the posterior probability of any residue in the first sequence being aligned to any residue in the second sequence <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. These residue match probabilities have been used in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-2">ProbCons</rs> <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>, a multiple sequence alignment program based on probabilistic consistency.</p>
            <p>Protein domain sequences and structures were obtained from the ASTRAL database (25) based on SCOP (24) version 1.69. We used the dataset consisting of representatives at the 40% sequence identity threshold (SCOP40). Domains from SCOP classes 1 to 4 [all alpha, all beta, alpha and beta (a/b), alpha and beta (a + b)] were selected. For each domain pair from the same superfamily of SCOP40, we computed a structural alignment using the program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-3">DaliLite</rs> <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>. Alignments with coverage (fraction of aligned region to the length of the shorter sequence) less than 0.6 were removed. The remaining alignments were divided into four datasets corresponding to four sequence identity bins: &lt;10, 10-15, 15-20 and 20-40%. The method for calculating sequence identity that takes into account unaligned regions is described in Supplementary Data. To apply cross validation training and testing, we divided the domain pairs in each identity bin into four subsets at the SCOP fold level, so that no domains belonging to the same SCOP fold were shared by any two subsets. We estimated HMM parameters using alignments in three subsets and tested the programs on representative domain pairs of the remaining fourth subset. This procedure was performed four times corresponding to four ways of partitioning into training and testing datasets. To obtain representative alignments from a subset for testing, we randomly selected one domain pair from each SCOP fold in that subset. The number of domain pairs in each training dataset is larger than 10 000 <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table S1)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The novelty of our complex HMMs is the introduction of more match states based on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-4">DaliLite</rs> structural alignments, which have aligned core blocks (structurally superimposable, shown in uppercase letters) and unaligned regions (structurally not superimposable, shown in lowercase letters) (a) Structure-based alignment and hidden state paths <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. (a) An illustration of structure-based sequence alignment and hidden state paths. In Sequences 1 and 2, uppercase letters and lowercase letters represent aligned core blocks and unaligned regions, respectively. If two corresponding unaligned regions bounded by the same two core blocks are of different length, we split the shorter one into two pieces and introduce contiguous gaps in the middle. For both N-and C-terminal ends, the shorter unaligned region is pushed toward the core blocks. Secondary structure (ss) types (helix, 'h'; strand, 'e'; coil, 'c') are shown for Sequence 1. The hidden state paths for three models are shown below the amino acid sequences. (b) Model structure of HMM_1_1_0. Residue pairs in unaligned regions are modeled using the same match state ('M') as those in the aligned blocks. Insertions in the first sequence and second sequence are modeled using states 'X' and 'Y', respectively. (c) Model structure of HMM_1_1_1. Residue pairs in the unaligned regions are modeled using a different match state ('U') than the match state in the core blocks ('M'). (d) Model structure of HMM_1_3_1. Residue pairs in aligned core blocks are modeled using three match states ('H', 'S', 'C') according to three secondary structure types of the first sequence. In (b), (c) and (d), match states are shown as squares and insertion states are shown as diamonds. Begin state, end state, and transitions from or to them are present in these models, but are not shown. <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a)</ref>. Residue pairs in aligned core blocks can be modeled by a match state ('M'). If the two unaligned regions in between two core blocks have different and non-zero lengths, they can be modeled using a different 'match' state ('U', for unaligned) <ref type="figure">(Figure 1c)</ref> and 'X' or 'Y' state. This is done by evenly splitting the unaligned residues in the sequence with the shorter unaligned region into two segments, placing them beside the two adjacent core blocks and separating them by a single stretch of gap symbols. In this way, transitions between 'X' and 'Y' do not occur. The residue pair emission probabilities of these artificially forced matches in unaligned regions ('U') are expected to be different from those in the core blocks ('M'). This model (HMM_1_1_1) has two distinct match states: 'M' and 'U' <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a and c)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the residue matches in aligned core blocks can be modeled by several distinct match states based on the local structure information of the first sequence, for instance, secondary structure types <ref type="figure">(Figure 1d)</ref>. Since residue usage and substitution patterns can vary for different local structural environments, the three match states according to secondary structure types have different sets of emission probabilities of 400 residue pairs. Secondary structure types were assigned using program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-5">DSSP</rs> <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref> for SCOP domains. The model that incorporates three secondary structure types ('H': helix, 'S': strand and 'C': coil) of the first sequence and unaligned match state ('U') is named HMM_1_3_1 <ref type="figure">(Figure 1d)</ref>. Similarly, multiple match states can be introduced based on several solvent accessibility categories, or a combination of solvent accessibility categories and secondary structure types. Solvent accessibilities of residue sidechains were calculated by program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-6">NACCESS</rs> <ref type="bibr">(28)</ref>. Three solvent accessibility categories were used based on our previous studies <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>. The model that incorporates three solvent accessibility categories and unaligned match state is named HMM_3_1_1. Combination of three solvent accessibility categories and three secondary structure types results in nine classes of match states for the core blocks (model HMM_3_3_1).</p>
            <p>Estimation of HMM parameters. We used a supervised learning method to estimate HMM parameters from <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-7">DaliLite</rs> structural alignments, since hidden state paths are known for them <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a)</ref> <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. These parameters are: transition probabilities among hidden states [match state(s), 'X' state, 'Y' state, begin state and end state], emission probabilities of residue pairs for each match state, and residue emission probabilities for 'X' state and 'Y' state <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. Given a training dataset, we assign a weight to each sequence. If a sequence occurs N times in the dataset, its weight is 1/N 1/2 . For large SCOP superfamilies, one sequence is involved in a large number of pairwise alignments. Sequence weighting aims to reduce the bias introduced by large superfamilies and folds. The parameters were estimated from weighted counts of observed transitions and emissions in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-8">DaliLite</rs> alignments <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The supervised learning method was also used to estimate model parameters from pairwise alignments in BAliBASE2.0 (30), from which <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-9">ProbCons</rs> derived its HMM parameters with a different approach <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. These alignments also have core blocks assigned (uppercase letters). However, local structural information is not available for every sequence. Therefore, from BAliBASE2.0 pairwise alignments, we derived parameters only for models HMM_1_1_0 and HMM_1_1_1 that do not have local structure-dependent match states.</p>
            <p>We have developed a progressive multiple sequence alignment program implementing our HMMs (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-10">MUMMALS</rs>, standing for MUltiple alignment with Multiple MAtch state models of Local Structure). It applies a probabilistic consistency scoring function similar to the one in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-11">ProbCons</rs> <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. First, a tree is built-in a fast way based on a k-mer count method <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. An initial alignment is built progressively guided by the tree with a simple sum-of-pairs scoring function. A second tree is then built with a UPGMA method based on sequence identities calculated from the initial alignment. We then apply the probabilistic consistency strategy as described by Do et al. <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. For each sequence pair, we calculate the match probabilities of residue pairs using one of the HMMs. These probability matrices are subject to consistency measure, which involves multiplications of the matrices <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. Finally, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-12">MUMMALS</rs> progressively aligns the sequences guided by the second tree using the consistencybased scoring function.</p>
            <p>To properly balance alignment speed and accuracy, we have also applied a two-stage alignment strategy similar to the one used in our program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-13">PCMA</rs> <ref type="bibr">(32)</ref>. In the first stage, highly similar sequences are progressively aligned in a fast way without consistency scoring. The scoring function in this stage is a weighted sum-of-pairs measure of BLOSUM62 scores <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>. If two neighboring groups on a tree have an average sequence identity higher than a certain threshold, they are aligned in this fast way. The result of the first stage is a set of pre-aligned groups that are relatively divergent from each other. In the second alignment stage, one representative sequence is selected from each pre-aligned group, and these representative sequences are subject to the more time-consuming probabilistic consistency measure. Then the representatives are aligned progressively according to the consistency-based scoring function. Finally, the prealigned groups obtained in the first stage are merged according to the alignment of the representatives to obtain the final alignment of all sequences.</p>
            <p>To test multiple sequence alignment programs, we used the same representative SCOP pairs selected for pairwise alignment tests <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table S1)</ref>. For each domain, we added up to 24 homologs, which were obtained from PSI-BLAST searches (1) with five iterations and an E-value cut-off of 0.0001. We removed highly similar sequences (&gt;97% identity) and sequence fragments (coverage less than half of the query) before randomly selecting up to 24 homologs. This procedure is similar to the one used to build the PREFAB database <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. Similar to pairwise alignment tests, the 4-fold cross validation approach is applied to the tests of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-14">MUMMALS</rs>.</p>
            <p>Two large testing datasets compiled by other researchers were used as well. One is the SABmark database (version 1.65) <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref>, which is based on homologous SCOP domains, and the other is PREFAB database (version 4) (10), which is based on structural alignments and homologous sequences from database searches. Alignment quality scores (Q-scores) were calculated using the built-in programs in SABmark and PREFAB packages. The Q-score is the fraction of the number of correctly aligned residue pairs in the test alignment to the total number of aligned residue pairs in the reference alignment. Additional series of smaller datasets constructed by<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-15">MAFFT</rs> authors (11) were 55 HOMSTRAD (34) structural alignments with various numbers of close homologs added ('HOM + X', 'X' is the number of close homologs added and is 0, 20, 50 or 100). To obtain more balanced datasets from 'HOM + 100', we used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-16">BLASTCLUST</rs> to cluster sequences in any 'HOM + 100' alignment at 50 or 60% identity level, and selected up to two homologs in each sequence cluster. The resulting datasets are called 'HOM + 100_bcl50' and 'HOM + 100_bcl60'. We also tested programs on 218 BAliBASE3.0 (35) alignments with full-length sequences. The column scores (the fraction of entirely correct columns) were reported in addition to Q-scores for BAliBASE3.0. Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests were performed to calculate statistical significance of comparisons between alignment programs, which include <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-124">ProbCons</rs> (version <rs corresp="#d3cf53c613-software-124" resp="#annotator12" type="version">1.10</rs>) (23),<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-125">MAFFT</rs> (version <rs corresp="#d3cf53c613-software-125" resp="#annotator12" type="version">5.667</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref> with several options, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-126">MUSCLE</rs> (version <rs corresp="#d3cf53c613-software-126" resp="#annotator12" type="version">3.52</rs>) (10) and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-127">ClustalW</rs> (version <rs corresp="#d3cf53c613-software-127" resp="#annotator12" type="version">1.83</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-128">MUMMALS</rs> multiple alignment web server is at:<rs corresp="#d3cf53c613-software-128" resp="#curator" type="url">http://prodata.swmed.edu/mummals</rs>/, with the source code of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-27">MUMMALS</rs> available for download.</p>
            <p>Several conclusions can be drawn from <ref type="table">Table 1 and Supplementary Table S</ref>3. (i) For each testing dataset, the best performance is usually achieved with parameters estimated on the training dataset with the same identity range (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S3)</ref>. For example, models trained on alignments with the highest identity range (20-40%) exhibit best performance on testing alignments in that range. Thus residue substitution and insertion/deletion statistics are different for sequence pairs with different degrees of similarity, in agreement with other reports <ref type="bibr">(16,17)</ref>. Although models trained on pairs with the lowest identity range can perform slightly better (2%) on representatives in that range, they perform much worse on alignments with the highest identity range (nearly 10% decrease as compared to models trained on pairs with the highest identity range). (ii) More complex HMMs improve alignment quality. For example, HMM_1_3_1 performs better than HMM_1_1_1 in almost every case. HMM_1_3_1 performs almost equally well to HMM_3_3_1. (iii) Our models trained on pairs with 20-40% identity range perform better than several other aligners, such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-28">ProbCons</rs> (23), <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-29">MAFFT</rs> (11) with several option, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-30">MUSCLE</rs> <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-31">ClustalW</rs> <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> on any testing dataset. Although the simplest model HMM_1_1_0 has the same model structure as the one used in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-32">ProbCons</rs>, it gives 3-4% increase over <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-33">ProbCons</rs> for every testing dataset. The best models HMM_1_3_1 and HMM_3_3_1 give 4-5% increase over <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-34">ProbCons</rs>. (iv) When trained on BAliBASE2.0, HMM_1_1_0 and HMM_1_1_1 exhibit inferior performance compared to the same models trained on SCOP domain pairs with identity above 20%, suggesting that SCOP domain pairs with above 20% identity is a better training dataset than BAliBASE2.0. The two models (especially HMM_1_1_1) trained on BAliBASE2.0 nevertheless give slightly better performance than <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-35">ProbCons</rs>, which was also trained on BAliBASE2.0 but with a different training method (unsupervised learning) <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>.</p>
            <p>To further compare the performance of our HMMs and the one used in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-36">ProbCons</rs>, we tested sequence pairs from BAliBASE2.0, on which the HMM in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-37">ProbCons</rs> was trained (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S</ref></p>
            <p>We implemented our HMM models in a multiple sequence alignment program based on probabilistic consistency. Our program is named <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-38">MUMMALS</rs>, standing for MUltiple alignment with Multiple MAtch state models of Local Structure. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-39">MUMMALS</rs> was compared to several other programs, such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-40">ProbCons</rs> <ref type="formula">(23)</ref>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-41">MAFFT</rs> (11), <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-42">MUSCLE</rs> (10)and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-43">ClustalW</rs> <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>. We assembled testing datasets of multiple sequences by adding homologs to pairwise alignments of SCOP domain pairs (see Materials and Methods). For three testing datasets with identity ranges below 20%,<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-44">MUMMALS</rs> shows 3-4% increase of average Q-score over <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-45">ProbCons</rs> when the best-performing HMMs are selected (HMM_1_3_1 and HMM_3_3_1) <ref type="table">Table 2)</ref>. For the dataset with identity range above 20%, the improvement is less prominent (1%), although still statistically significant (P &lt; 0.005). Among the other programs tested (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-46">ProbCons</rs>, several options of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-47">MAFFT</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-48">MUSCLE</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-49">ClustalW</rs>), <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-50">MAFFT</rs> with options [lg]insi usually gives the best performance. Our program still outperforms any <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-51">MAFFT</rs> option by 2% for the three datasets with identity ranges below 20%. The other two large datasets we have used for testing are PREFAB version 4 (PREFAB4) (10) and SABmark version 1.65 <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref>. PREFAB4 consists of 1682 alignments based on the consensus of two structural alignment programs <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-52">SOFI</rs> <ref type="bibr">(40)</ref> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-53">CE</rs> <ref type="bibr">(41)</ref>, with up to 24 homologous sequences added from database searches. SABmark database has two alignment sets. The 'twilight zone' set contains SCOP (version 1.65) domain pairs with very low-to-low similarity and the 'superfamily' set contains SCOP domains with low to intermediate similarity. The reference alignments in SABmark were also derived from the consensus of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-54">SOFI</rs> and CE. The comparison of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-55">MUMMALS</rs> with the other programs on PREFAB4 and SABmark shows similar trends as seen in datasets assembled by us. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-56">MUMMALS</rs> with the best-performing models (HMM_1_3_1 and HMM_3_3_1) gives the highest average Q-scores, with 2-4% increase over <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-57">ProbCons</rs> and 1% increase over the best of the<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-58">MAFFT</rs> series <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-59">MUMMALS</rs> performs better than other programs for testing datasets 'HOM + 0', 'HOM + 20' and 'HOM + 50'. The results of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-60">MUMMALS</rs> on 'HOM + 100' are inferior to those on 'HOM + 50', which is in contrast to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-61">MAFFT</rs> that shows consistent increase of accuracy when more homologs are added. We reason that such a problem of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-62">MUMMALS</rs> is due to excessive number of close homologs in some sequence subgroups in 'HOM + 100' test cases, since our consistency measure does not take into account similarities among the testing sequences. To test this hypothesis, we removed closely related sequences in 'HOM + 100' alignment at 50 or 60% identity level (datasets 'HOM + 100_bcl50' and 'HOM + 100_bcl60'). The remaining sequences are more balanced in terms of similarities among them. We indeed obtained the best <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-63">MUMMALS</rs> performance after removing closely related sequences (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S</ref> <ref type="bibr">5)</ref>. A similar degrading effect of closely related sequences is observed for <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-64">ProbCons</rs>, which is also based on probabilistic consistency.</p>
            <p>Recently, BAliBASE3.0 multiple alignment benchmark has been released <ref type="bibr">(35)</ref>. We tested the programs on 218 BAliBASE3.0 alignments with full-length sequences. These alignments represent difficult cases since N-or C-terminal non-homologous regions are included for some sequences. The average Q-scores and column scores (the fraction of entirely correctly columns) in manually defined core blocks are reported in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. For Q-score measurement of alignment quality, the Wilcoxon signed rank tests show that<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-65">MUMMALS</rs> with best-performing models (HMM_3_3_1 or HMM_1_3_1) is statistically better than other programs, albeit <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-66">MUMMALS</rs> does not have the highest average Q-score. For column score measurement of alignment quality, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-67">MUMMALS</rs> with HMM_3_3_1 or HMM_1_3_1 has a lower average column score than <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-68">MAFFT</rs>-[le]insi and<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-69">ProbCons</rs>, but the difference between them is not statisticallysignificant. In fact <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-70">MUMMALS</rs> with HMM_3_3_1 outperforms <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-71">MAFFT-linsi</rs> (having the best average scores) in 106 cases while <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-72">MAFFT-linsi</rs> performs better in 67 cases, measured by column score. We found that the major cause of lower average column score of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-73">MUMMALS</rs> is due to a few alignments that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-74">MUMMALS</rs> gives considerably lower scores as compared to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-75">MAFFT-linsi</rs> (10 alignments with a score difference larger than 0.5). Manual inspections of these alignments revealed some interesting scenarios. In some cases, the low scores of<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-76">MUMMALS</rs> are due to wrong alignment of a few divergent sequences, some of which have long extensions at the ends. Column score is very sensitive in such situations, since a low score is produced even if only one sequence is incorrectly aligned in many places. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-77">MAFFT</rs> alignments with local options ([le]insi) indeed show advantage in these situations <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. In several other cases, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-78">MUMMALS</rs> produces structurally meaningful alignments that are scored very low since they are not consistent with the reference alignments (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref> <ref type="figure">Figure S1a)</ref>. One group contains three domains in the order of 'fer2', 'FAD_binding_6' (oxidoreductase FAD-binding domain) and 'NAD_binding_1' (oxidoreductase NAD-binding domain). The other group contains the same three domains, but in the order of 'FAD_binding_6', 'NAD_binding_1' and 'fer2'. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-79">MUMMALS</rs> aligns 'FAD_binding_6' and 'NAD_binding_1' for the two groups and thus misaligned the 'fer2' domain. Since the reference-dependent evaluation is based on 'fer2' domain,<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-80">MUMMALS</rs> alignment gets a column score of zero. Another evaluation problem is caused by domain duplication or repeats, as exemplified by test case BB40040. Most of BB40040 sequences have a single domain of carbonic anhydrase. However, the sequence 'CAH_DUNSA' has two such domains (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1b)</ref>. The reference alignment aligns the first domain of 'CAH_DUNSA' to other sequences while <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-81">MUMMALS</rs> aligns most of the second domain to other sequences, resulting in a low column score.</p>
            <p>Model HMM_1_3_1 has hidden secondary structuredependent match states that are used in alignment construction. However, secondary structure predictions are not explicitly generated and remain 'hidden' in the alignment process. A posterior decoding technique can be applied to this model to output explicit secondary structure predictions (see Supplementary Data for details). The prediction accuracy is 60% on representative SCOP domains <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table S</ref> <ref type="bibr">6)</ref>. This prediction accuracy is lower than many advanced methods, such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-82">PSI-PRED</rs> <ref type="bibr">(43)</ref>, which use homologs from database searches to enhance the secondary structure signal of a single sequence. Our HMM-based prediction of secondary structure corresponds to a single sequence predictor, since position-specific information from multiple homologs is not used. The prediction accuracy of model HMM_1_3_1 is comparable to other methods that generate predictions based on a single sequence <ref type="bibr">(44)</ref>.</p>
            <p>If secondary structure information is known for one of the aligned sequences, model HMM_1_3_1 can be modified to restrict the hidden state path to follow the experimental secondary structure (see Supplementary Data). Using real secondary structural information in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-83">MUMMALS</rs> with model HMM_1_3_1, we were able to obtain an average Q-score increase of 3% on SABmark datasets (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S8)</ref>. Such a result suggests that one limitation of<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-84">MUMMALS</rs> is the low accuracy of the implicit secondary structure prediction. Further improvement of alignment quality should be possible with more accurate secondary structure predictions that explore database homologs.</p>
            <p>All previously described tests are based on comparison with reference alignments that are treated as 'gold standards'. It is unclear how the quality of reference 'gold' alignments influences the ranking of alignment programs <ref type="bibr">(45)</ref>. Several examples from BAliBASE3.0 show some problems with referencedependent evaluation. Since the structures of all domains in our testing datasets are known, we can evaluate the quality of a test alignment using reference-independent scores that reflect the similarity between two structures after they are superimposed according to aligned residues in the test alignment. The structural scores we have used are: DALI Z-score, TM-score, GDT-TS score, 3D-score and two LiveBench contact scores. From <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, it is clear that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-85">MUMMALS</rs> with the best-performing models (HMM_1_3_1 and HMM_3_3_1) produces higher average referenceindependent structural scores than other programs for divergent domain pairs (identity below 20%), suggesting that our HMM models produce potentially more useful alignments in terms of structure modeling. Interestingly, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-86">MUMMALS</rs> does not produce the highest reference-independent sequencebased similarity scores (sequence identity and BLOSUM62 scores of aligned residue pairs). This result suggests that minimization of these sequence similarity measures alone does not lead to better alignment quality for divergent sequences. Our experiments with reference-independent evaluation shows good correlation with reference-dependent results described above, thus rendering a 'gold standard' reference unnecessary for alignment evaluation.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-87">MUMMALS</rs> shows improvement over <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-88">MAFFT</rs> and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-89">Prob- Cons</rs> by only a few percent in terms of average alignment quality scores on various testing datasets. Although this improvement is statistically significant and does not depend on the testing dataset (assembled by us, or by other researchers) or alignment quality measure (referencedependent Q-score, or reference-independent DALI Z-score, TM-score, GDT-TS, etc), it is not clear what these average scores actually represent. To gain more understanding, we directly compared alignment scores of different programs for individual domain pairs. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the number of alignments where one program performs better than another program by 10% or more (measured by Q-score or normalized TM-score) for 1207 divergent SCOP40 pairs with added homologs (sequence identity &lt;20%). The numbers for such differences among <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-90">MUMMALS</rs> family of programs with five different HMMs are relatively small, suggesting that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-91">MUMMALS</rs> with different HMMs generates alignments not that different from each other. The differences between<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-92">MUMMALS</rs> and other programs are significantly larger. For example, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-93">MUMMALS</rs> with HMM_3_3_1 has a large Q-score increase (&gt;10%) over <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-94">ProbCons</rs> on 201 alignments, while <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-95">ProbCons</rs> is better by 10% or more on 62 alignments. For <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-96">MUMMALS</rs> with HMM_3_3_1 and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-97">MAFFT-ginsi</rs>, these numbers are 199 and 117, respectively. Our comparisons thus suggest that different programs can explore somewhat different regions in alignment space, and the program giving lower average performance may be capable of generating better alignments in many cases. However, selection of a better alignment in the absence of structural comparison is still a difficult task <ref type="bibr">(46)</ref>.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-98">ProbCons</rs> (23) and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-99">MAFFT</rs> <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref> are two of the most accurate multiple sequence alignment programs that explore only sequence information. They use different strategies to improve the accuracy of progressive alignment. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-100">ProbCons</rs> mainly relies on the consistency-based scoring function and<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-101">MAFFT</rs> utilizes iterative refinement. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-102">MAFFT</rs>'s scoring function is a weighted sum-of-pairs score of BLOSUM62, a general amino acid substitution matrix. Recent versions of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-103">MAFFT</rs> enhance performance by exploring aligned core regions with a simple consistency measure <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. However, the time-consuming <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-104">ProbCons</rs>-type consistency operations on sequence triplets are not implemented in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-105">MAFFT</rs>. Our results show that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-106">MUMMALS</rs> based on probabilistic consistency can perform better than <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-107">MAFFT</rs>, implying that consistency-based scoring function is superior to weighted sum-of-pairs measures of general substitution matrices.</p>
            <p>Among existing multiple aligners, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-108">MUMMALS</rs> is methodologically closest to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-109">ProbCons</rs>. However, we implement HMMs that are different from the one used in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-110">ProbCons</rs> in three aspects. First, we introduce more complex model structures by increasing the number of match state types. While HMM_1_1_0, used mainly as a control, has the same model structure as the one in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-111">ProbCons</rs>, the other four models (HMM_1_1_1, HMM_1_3_1, HMM_3_1_1 and HMM_3_3_1) incorporate more match states, which take into account residue substitution differences in unaligned regions and aligned core blocks, as well as local structural differences in aligned core blocks. Second, we have estimated model parameters from <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-112">DaliLite</rs> structural alignments of divergent SCOP domains (&lt;40% identity), while the training data of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-113">ProbCons</rs> are from BAliBASE2.0. Third, we applied a supervised learning approach to estimating model parameters from structural alignments that have known hidden state paths. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-114">ProbCons</rs> applied an unsupervised learning approach (expectation maximization) to derive parameters without using reference alignments. Trained and tested on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-115">DaliLite</rs> structural alignments of SCOP40 domain pairs and on BAliBASE2.0 alignments, our models give better alignment quality than <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-116">ProbCons</rs> and a number of other programs. We show that more complex models improve alignment quality and SCOP40 superfamily pairs with identity range of 20-40% provide a better training dataset than BAliBASE2.0 alignments.</p>
            <p>The trade-off for improvement of alignment quality with more complex model structures is more time for computation(Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S</ref>2). HMM_3_3_1 (modeling both secondary structure and solvent accessibility) has the largest number of hidden states and is the most timeconsuming model, running about three times slower than HMM_1_3_1 (modeling only secondary structure). However, the performance of these two models is fairly similar in pairwise or multiple sequence alignment tests <ref type="table">(Tables 1-3)</ref>. HMM_3_1_1 (modeling only solvent accessibility) has the same time complexity as HMM_1_3_1, but usually shows slightly inferior performance to HMM_1_3_1. These observations suggest that HMM_1_3_1 (modeling only secondary structure) is most efficient in balancing alignment accuracy and speed. For <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-117">MUMMALS</rs>, the rate-limiting steps are the computation of match probabilities using forward and backward algorithms (time order is N 2 *L 2 *K 2 , N: number of sequences, L: average length, K: number of hidden states), and the computation of the consistency-based scoring function, which requires operations on all sequence triplets (time order is N 3 *L 2 ). If probabilistic consistency measure is applied to every sequence pair, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-118">MUMMALS</rs> is much slower than<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-119">MAFFT</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-120">MUSCLE</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-121">ClustalW</rs> (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S9)</ref>. For example, the median CPU time of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-122">MUMMALS</rs> with model HMM_1_3_1 on 1785 SCOP40 pairs with added homologs is 174s per alignment, as compared to 2.5s for<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-123">MAFFT</rs> with 'ginsi' option (on <rs corresp="#d3cf53c613-software-226" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Redhat</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-226">Enterprise Linux</rs> <rs corresp="#d3cf53c613-software-226" resp="#curator" type="version">3</rs>, AMD Opteron 2.0 GHz). Applying a two-stage alignment strategy similar to the one used in the program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-127">PCMA</rs> (32), we were able to make <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-128">MUMMALS</rs> almost an order of magnitude faster while still maintaining the same level of alignment accuracy on SCOP testing datasets (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S9</ref>). Since highly similar sequences can be aligned accurately with a general scoring function <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>, there is no need for all of them to be subject to the time-consuming consistency measure. Although adding homologous sequences can in general improve alignment quality, our results on HOMSTRAD datasets suggest that proper balance of the similarity among the added homologs is also critical for<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-129">MUMMALS</rs> as well as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-130">ProbCons</rs>.</p>
            <p>The first number is the number of cases where the alignment quality score of the program listed to the left (in a row) is inferior to that of the program listed above (in a column) by 0.1 or more. The second number is the number of cases where the score of the 'row' program is better than that of the 'column' program by 0.1 or more. The alignment quality scores in the lower triangle and upper triangle are Q-scores and weighted and normalized TM-scores, respectively. Comparisons of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-131">MUMMALS</rs> with the best model (HMM_3_3_1) with other programs are highlighted in bold.</p>
            <p>alignments that are correct from structure modeling perspective. However, structure superposition programs usually provide a single best alignment. Some problems of referencedependent evaluations are illustrated by examples from BAliBASE3.0. For SCOP40 testing datasets, we found about 20 domain pairs for which all sequence-based programs failed to align a single position correctly according to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-132">DaliLite</rs> reference alignment. Manual inspection of these instances suggests that most of these domains involve structural repeats. Many alignments produced by the tested programs did produce structurally meaningful results, but they had zero scores because they matched different repeats than those aligned by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-133">DaliLite</rs>. Reference-independent evaluation can avoid these drawbacks. Although reference-independent evaluation is routinely used for assessing structure prediction models <ref type="bibr">(50,51)</ref>, it has not been frequently used in assessment of multiple sequence alignment programs <ref type="bibr">(10,45)</ref>. Our results show that reference-independent evaluation using various structural similarity scores produces similar, if not identical, rankings of the programs compared to reference-dependent evaluations using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-134">DaliLite</rs> alignments <ref type="table">(Table 3</ref>). On the one hand, this result suggests that a large collection of reference alignments generated by structure alignment program<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-135">DaliLite</rs> are on average well-suited for assessment of alignment quality. On the other hand, it is probably unnecessary to have a set of 'gold standard' reference alignments. Reference-independent evaluation through scoring superpositions generated according sequence-based alignments is an easier and maybe more fair method to assess alignment quality and to compare different aligners. Therefore, particularly when the size of a testing dataset is large, improving reference alignment quality either by manual inspection and adjustment <ref type="bibr">(30)</ref>, or by using the consensus of structural aligners (10,33) is probably not necessary. With reference-independent evaluation techniques, we even suggest bypassing the step of generating reference alignments.</p>
            <p>Despite several percentage points' improvement in alignments provided by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-136">MUMMALS</rs>, alignment quality for divergent sequences (sequence identity &lt;15%) is still not high, since only 50% or even less residue pairs on average are aligned correctly according to reference alignments <ref type="table">Table 2)</ref>. Although the best programs (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-137">MUMMALS</rs>,<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-138">MAFFT</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-139">ProbCons</rs>) have limited differences in terms of average alignment quality score, they can produce quite different alignments for some sequence pairs <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>. It can be a good practice to use several aligners to generate alignments for divergent sequences. Manual examination of these alignments can be helpful in making expert judgments. Exploration of the consensus among programs is fruitful as well and is frequently used in meta-servers for structure prediction <ref type="bibr">(52-54)</ref>. Results of the meta-aligner <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-140">M-COFFEE</rs> (46) as well as ours (data not shown, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-141">MUMMALS</rs> package contains a meta-program similar to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-142">M-COFFEE</rs>) suggest that combining different multiple sequence aligners can give significant but limited improvement of alignment quality.</p>
            <p>One advantage of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d3cf53c613-software-simple-143">MUMMALS</rs> is the use of HMMs with local structure information learned from structural alignments. Our model HMM_1_3_1 gives low secondary structure prediction accuracy. Providing real secondary structure information to this model can further improve alignment quality by a few percent. These results suggest that application of more accurate secondary structure predictions can lead to better alignment quality. Exploration of database sequence homologs and available 3D structures was also shown to be helpful <ref type="bibr">(11,55,56)</ref>. Further enhancement of multiple alignment quality could be achieved by effective integration of existing alignment techniques and various evolutionary and structural information resources.</p>

            <p>For all preprocessing and subsequent analysis, we used the<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="b5da7864cc-software-0">FieldTrip toolbox</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Oostenveld et al., 2011)</ref> which is implemented in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="b5da7864cc-software-1">Matlab</rs> (<rs corresp="#b5da7864cc-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Mathworks</rs>, MA, USA). We performed the following preprocessing steps: re-referencing to the average of the left and right mastoid channels, band-pass filtering 0.3-100, 60 Hz line filtering, and artifact removal. Prior to artifact removal, EEG epochs were extracted from the continuous EEG from 1000 ms before, to 2000 ms after onset of the CWs. Single word epochs with artifacts that occurred between 200 ms before to 800 ms after stimulus onset were removed from analysis. A Z -score based algorithm was used to detect eye blinks and eye movements, and other artifacts were detected with a threshold algorithm. After removal, about 70% of single word epochs remained. There were an average (marginal means) of 436 single word epochs in the sentence condition, 462 in the scrambled sentence condition, 480 in the OC condition, and 417 in the CC condition. The cell means were 220 for OC in sentence, 260 for OC in scrambled sentence, 216 for CC in sentence, and 202 for CC in scrambled sentence. A two-way ANOVA on these groups did not reveal statistical differences in the remaining number of words between these conditions.</p>

            <p>Since great accuracy and speed is not necessary in the y-axis, this direction is manually controlled by a Newport NSC200, which drives an open-loop Newport CMA-25PP motor with a bi-directional repeatability of 4 µm and velocity of 0.4 mm/s. However, in the x-and zaxes, Newport's computer guided ESP301 motion controller in combination with Newport's LTA-HS closed loop servomotors (with a typical bi-directional repeatability of 0.6 µm and velocity of 5 mm/s) are used to position the specimen. A <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="a99284cb6a-software-simple-0">LabVIEW</rs> program coordinates image acquisition and motor positioning simultaneously. The image acquisition routine consists of grabbing a column of image data from the camera and moving the specimen the width of that column and then collecting another column. These columns are stitched together to form a composite image across the full width of the specimen. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>(a) shows the ROI (i.e., the confocal paramater) in an image of the mouse cochlea. The Rayleigh range x R was calculated <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> with the 5X Plan Apo microscopic objective to approximately 34 µm and thus the confocal parameter b is 68 µm. To the left and the right of the ROI, the image appears out-of-focus due to greater beam thickness and light scattering. In addition, a blur is present in the lower left of the image, which is due to the presence of a high density structure (i.e. bone) in the cochlea that lies between the optical section and collecting lens of the Olympus microscope. However, <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>(b) shows that stitching of multiple ROIs across the width of the specimen, results in improved focus of specimen across its width. Higher magnification of these stitched image columns <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>(c)] reveals some stitching artifacts due to image column misalignments.In order to produce a stitched image without columns artifacts like shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>(c), it is crucial to find a relationship between the moved distance m (µm) and the strip width w ROI (pixel). Since the magnification M of the microscope is the factor between its image and the original, it is also the major parameter in the relationship between m and w ROI . But because m is defined in µm and w ROI in pixels, the correction factor p, defined as the pixel size of the camera, is also included in Eq. <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The resolution of the encoder s i was determined by moving the motor 1 mm and counting the encoder signals. One encoder impulse for the Newport LTA-HS is equivalent to s i = 0.14 µm which is important for the calculation of the relationship i. For example, the Retiga 2000R at 5x magnification p/M = 1.48 µm/pixel and when w ROI = 9 lines, an output signal has to be generated after every 94 input ticks of the encoder. This signal goes directly over the digital output via the SCB-68 connector block into the optic-coupled input of the camera where it initiates an exposure of the chip. The pictures are picked up on demand by a loop in the controlling <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="a99284cb6a-software-simple-1">LabVIEW</rs> program. The whole concept for a hardware triggered system is summarized in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.With this system, acquisition is triggered by a hardware signal generated by the motor position. That means that there is a constant time gap between the arrival of the specimen at the desired position and the exposure of the camera, which makes the system real-time capable. This prevents artifacts from being produced by asynchronies between the software acquisition loop and the hardware motor position during the scan. One significant improvement of this system was that the produced composite images were almost completely free from the previous stitching artifacts using the start/stop procedure. Only very rarely did an artifact line appear due to a slight movement of the specimen in-between two strips. These artifacts were rare and minimal as long as the slice width was small (roughly under 10 lines).</p>

            <p>Regarding the first type of methods employed to detect subcomplexes in AP data, there are many available clustering algorithms that could be applied to the networks resulting from the scoring step. Most have been proposed following the assumption that complexes can be reconstructed from highly densely connected regions in the network <ref type="bibr">13</ref>: RNSC and MCL are some important examples <ref type="bibr">14</ref>. A review of twelve of these algorithms <ref type="bibr">15</ref> claim that the best prediction method is ''Infomap'', followed by ''Fast modularity'', and ''Potts model approach''. However, it has also been argued that densely connected regions do not reflect functional units; hence, alternative ways to look at the complex prediction problem have been proposed <ref type="bibr">13,16,17</ref>. In addition, complex prediction algorithms have also evolved from algorithms that generate non-intersecting or non-overlapping clusters to algorithms that take into account the fact that protein complexes share subunits with other complexes, i.e., overlapping community detection algorithms. Some of these methods are <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-0">MCODE</rs> <ref type="bibr">18</ref>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-1">CFinder</rs> <ref type="bibr">19</ref>, Link-communities <ref type="bibr">10,20</ref>, OCG 11 , <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-2">Cluster-ONE</rs> <ref type="bibr">21</ref> and RSRGM <ref type="bibr">17</ref>. Regarding the second type of methods that allow subcomplex detection, an early strategy to take into account the overlapping nature of complexes and apply it to complex identification from AP experiments was introduced by Gavin et al. <ref type="bibr">6</ref>, who, after applying the SA score to AP data, performed repeated hierarchical clustering using different parameters to generate overlapping complexes that they described as composed of common ''cores'' and ''attachments''. Two recent papers, <ref type="bibr">22</ref> and 23 , present a review of current clustering methods applied to protein complex identification.

In this paper, we will explore the detection of biologically relevant subcomplexes from AP data through some of the above-mentioned techniques, and suggest a new strategy which might be able to improve them. We will evaluate the use of some recent methods that are able to detect ''nested communities'' or ''hierarchies'', in order to prove whether or not these nested communities can detect biologically meaningful subcomplexes, while we introduce a new method to identify subcomplexes from AP data. We start from the premise that most of the previous procedures remove the multi-edge nature of pull-down data in an interaction network (i.e., bait-prey co-occurrences), which is the network signature of a subcomplex. For example, some scoring methods reduce all co-appearances of a bait and a prey protein to one single weighted interaction, whereas some clustering methods explicitly remove any subcomplex candidates. An example of this is the Leu4-Leu9 interaction from Gavin's dataset <ref type="bibr">6</ref> : This interaction does not end up in any complexes when using the PE score, whilst the SA scores produce three complexes and the Dice score produces 2 complexes containing Leu4, Leu9 and a few more subunits. A Leu4-Leu9 complex does not appear in the results with any scoring method and, in fact, Leu4 and Leu9 are the subunits of the alpha-isopropylmalate synthase. This demonstrates how a highly scored copurification, which happens to be a complex, may get filtered out by the clustering method. Here we introduce TRIBAL (TRIad-Based ALgorithm), a novel method to identify subcomplexes from AP data that preserves and exploits this co-occurrence information.</p>
            <p>Subcomplex predictions using the above-mentioned overlapping clustering strategies were generated by extracting all predicted complexes which were contained (meet-min 5 1.0) by at least one other predicted complex. The result was a prediction of 102 subcomplexesSubcomplexes predictions using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-5">CACHET</rs> method were generated by removing all complexes without attachments and then selecting the cores of the remaining complexes, as explained in Methods. The result was 309 subcomplex predictions.</p>
            <p>Other studies use different methods to determine what a match is. For example, Wu et al. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> use a ''geometric index'' (also called NAscore) smaller than 0.2. The results under this alternative method can be found in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. In this case, results partially contradict the previous analysis, and now Link communities has the best performance, with the best F-measure belonging to a combination of Dicescore and Link communities clustering. We hypothesize that the reason of this difference might be the fact that the hypergeometric score is more sensitive to the size of the complexes and OCG is predicting complexes of a size larger than expected, as it can be observed in the Supplementary file (section 4). However, our main interest is not to evaluate the ability to identify complexes but the ability to identify subcomplexes. We begin by verifying that all datasets under study contain subcomplexes: The MIPS dataset (our reference set) includes 16 subcomplexes. Raw data includes 348 groups of proteins contained in others. None of the sets produced by hierarchical clustering display subcomplexes, as these are non-overlapping methods. The predicted sets (Dice-lcomm, PElcomm, SA-lcomm, Dice-OCG, Hart-OCG, PE-OCG, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-6">CACHET</rs> and TRIBAL) display between 7 and 309 subcomplexes.</p>
            <p>In order to evaluate the subcomplex detection abilities of these methods, we performed two different analyses. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> summarizes the precision and recall analysis for predicted subcomplexes when compared to the full MIPS dataset, using a hyper-geometric score as a criterion for a match. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> does the same when using the geometric score. The results show that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-7">CACHET</rs> has the best F-measure in both cases. Despite the fact that TRIBAL has the best precision in both cases, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-8">CACHET</rs> has a far better recall which ultimately leads to a better F-measure.</p>
            <p>For this reason, we use the meet-min index to verify that predicted subcomplexes are not only similar but contained by MIPS complexes. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> depicts the number and percentage of validated predicted subcomplexes for TRIBAL, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-9">CACHET</rs> and six other methods which combine different scoring and clustering systems, using the meetmin index as comparison criterion. The results show that TRIBAL outperforms all other methods for meet-min equal to 1.0. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-10">CACHET</rs> shows a good performance to low meet-min values, but it decreases strongly when meet-min increases.</p>
            <p>We tested and compared the performance of different combinations of scoring methods (Dice, PE, Hart, SA) and overlapping clustering algorithms (Link-communities, OCG), with one method based on the core-attachment model (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-11">CACHET</rs>) and our own method (TRIBAL). All these three types of methods are based on different assumptions; for example, that subcomplexes can be extracted from high-degree (highly connected) regions of the network or, in our case, that co-purification information with different baits is not only useful as a data quality measure but can also include co-complex information in different biological contexts. These assumptions can be partially validated through the performances of the methods. The results show that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-12">CACHET</rs> gives the best results in terms of similarity (geometric or hypergeometric indexes) to the MIPS reference set (this is mainly due to its better recall), while TRIBAL offers the best precision in terms of similarity and the best performance in terms of containment metrics (meet-min index). From the group of overlapping clustering methods, Link-communities shows better results than OCG.</p>
            <p>We have made a thorough analysis of the traditional complex prediction pipeline for AP-MS experiments. Besides problems due to coverage, false positives and inconsistencies regarding mutual pull-down (see Supplementary File), most traditional methods are not able to detect subcomplexes due to decisions made in the scoring and clustering steps. Based on this knowledge, we have identified the best strategies to detect subcomplexes, including the development of TRIBAL, a simple strategy that improves the precision of subcomplex prediction compared to previous methods. These strategies are the initial attempts to specifically address the subcomplex detection problem in co-purification data. This paper suggests that overlapping clustering methods fail to detect subcomplexes from AP data while the core-attachment model used by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-13">CACHET</rs> and similar software seems to be the best option to this date. However, it also suggests that alternatives such as the co-purification matrix introduced by TRIBAL deserve more attention, as they show potential thanks to a high precision, especially when we evaluate the meet-min index, i.e., subcomplexes absolutely contained by larger complexes. Finally, research in subcomplex identification demands the generation of curated gold standards for subcomplexes, which will be an important step to achieve a better validation of predictions.</p>

            <p>Clustering methods. Link-communities is a method that uses communities of edges and not of nodes. OCG hierarchically merges edges into modules, checking the value of a special modularity function Q. Both OCG and Link-communities were performed using the ''<rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-22">linkcomm</rs>'' <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-23">R</rs> package <ref type="bibr">20</ref>.</p>

The 369 complexes generated by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-25">CACHET</rs> from Gavin's dataset, were retrieved from their web page <ref type="bibr">26</ref>. In order to generate subcomplexes, we selected all complexes containing both core and attachments (i.e., we removed all only-core complexes). Subcomplexes were defined as the cores of those core-attachment sets.</p>
            <p>The comparison is done through three strategies: Firstly, through a hypergeometric test, as defined in eq. <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. In this test, the population is the total number of proteins, the population success is the size of the MIPS complex, the sample is the predicted complex (predicted either by any combination of the scores and clustering algorithms here employed, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-26">CACHET</rs> or TRIBAL) and the success sample is the size of the intersection between MIPS and the predicted complex. The overlap is considered significant when p-value , 0.05. Secondly, the geometric index, defined as follows:</p>
            <p>The performance of each method was assessed by computing their precision, recall and F-measure, defined as follows:TRIBAL algorithm.

Students wore an accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X+ and GT3X models, Pensacola, FL, USA <ref type="bibr">43</ref>) for 7 days during waking hours. Physical activity data were included in the physical activity analyses if the accelerometer was worn for ⩾ 600 min on ⩾ 3 days per week. <ref type="bibr">44-46</ref> The Evenson cutpoints were used to categorise the intensity of physical activity. <ref type="bibr">47</ref> Outcome measures: indicators of adiposity.

            <p>supplemental methods in the online appendix available at http://dx.doi.org/ 10.2337/db07-1751). Whole-blood and plasma measurements. Total white blood cell number and differential counts were assessed by standard techniques (ACP Diagnostic Lab, University of California, San Diego). We measured plasma insulin by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research) and determined free fatty acids by colorimetric assay (Wako). Plasma cytokines were measured by the core laboratories of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Consortium (University of California, Los Angeles; LINCOplex assay for Mouse Cytokines, http://www.derc.med.ucla.edu/core.htm). Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured by enzymatic methods using an automated bichromatic analyzer (Abbot Diagnostics). All of these measurements were performed on 11 wild-type and 9 ␣4(Y991A) mice for high-fat diet and 6 wild-type and 5 ␣4(Y991A) mice for chow diet <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Histochemistry. Adipose tissue was fixed overnight in 10% formaldehyde, dehydrated in ethanol bath, and paraffin-embedded. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) for observation of adipose tissue structure. Pancreas isolation and determination of islet area. Pancreata were isolated and fixed in 4% formalin overnight. Paraffin sections were generated and stained with H-E. Pictures were taken of H-E-stained pancreas sections, and the area of Langerhans islets and the total area of the pancreas were measured using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="def90e121a-software-0">ImageJ</rs> software (<rs corresp="#def90e121a-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NIH</rs> freeware). Islet area was depicted as percentage of total pancreas area. Sections of four to seven mice per group and at least six different pancreas areas per mouse were analyzed for statistical significance using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. P values Ͻ0.05 were considered significant. Bone marrow transplantation. We injected bone marrow obtained from wild-type and ␣4(Y991A) mice (4 ϫ 10 6 cells) through the tail vein into male C57BL/6 (4 months) and ␣4(Y991A) (4 -6 months) mice that had been irradiated (10 Gy) 4 h before. Mice were allowed 4 weeks for reconstitution of donor marrow, which we verified by PCR <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Isolation of stromal vascular cells. Epidydimal fat pads were minced in PBS and digested with collagenase (Roche) and DNase I (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C. Suspensions were then filtered through a 100-m nylon cell strainer and then spun at 1,000g for 10 min. The preadipocyte/adipocyte-enriched fraction was removed. Isolated stromal vascular cells were resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (10 mmol/l KHCO 3 , 150 mmol/l NH 4 Cl, and 0.1 mmol/l EDTA, pH 8) for 5 min at room temperature. Cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 500g, and stromal vascular cells were resuspended in PBS at 10 6 cells/100 l. Flow cytometry. Cells were harvested from WAT, peripheral blood, and bone marrow and incubated in Fc blocker (rat anti-mouse CD16/32) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Ly-6G (1/200) and phycoerythrin (PE)-7/4 (1/50) (BD Biosciences/ PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Negative control staining was performed with FITC-rat IgG2a/k and PE-rat IgG2a. Cell staining was analyzed with FACScan flow cytometer using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="def90e121a-software-1">CellQuest</rs> software (<rs corresp="#def90e121a-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">BD Biosciences Systems</rs>). Cell migration assay. Cell migration was assayed in a modified Boyden chamber system using a 24-well transwell plate (8-m pore size; Corning) coated with 5 g/ml VCAM-1 (R&amp;D Systems). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (R&amp;D Systems) was added in the lower chamber at 1 nmol/l. Cells harvested from wild-type or ␣4(Y991A) bone marrow were grown for 5-7 days in the presence of granulocyte macrophage-colonystimulating factor (5 l of 0.1 mg/ml stock solution). Bone marrow-derived macrophages (2 ϫ 10 4 ) were kept in suspension in 1% serum containing medium for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then added to the top chamber and incubated overnight at 37°C. Filters were fixed and stained with crystal violet, and migrated cells in the lower chamber were enumerated. RNA isolation and RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from WAT using RNeasy Lipid Tissue kit (Qiagen). RT-PCRs were carried out as described in the online appendix <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. Statistical analysis. Means and SEs were calculated for all dependent measures. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using the one-or two-tailed Student's t test. Significance was set at P Յ 0.05. For <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>B, change scores for the chow diet and high-fat diet data were determined using the total area under the curve (AUC) <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Gene Re-Annotation in the Neisseriaceae Family [Vol. 20, annotation. For example, Warren et al. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> uncovered 38 895 intergenic open reading frames (ORFs), readily identified as putative genes by similarity to currently annotated genes, from 1297 prokaryotic replicons based on across-genome alignment. New genes could be confirmed by the similarity alignment or by transcription or proteome analyses. In this work, we first used the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a2fe7a0373-software-1">ZCURVE</rs> <ref type="bibr">26</ref> program, which is freely available at <rs corresp="#a2fe7a0373-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/Zcurve_B</rs>/, to pick out all candidate genes that did not have same 5 0 terminals with all genes in the original annotation. The candidate may overlap one annotated gene with their sequences but they did not correspond to the same reading frame. Then those candidate new genes would be filtered by blast <ref type="bibr">27</ref> against the NCBI nr database. If one candidate met the following three conditions, it would be regarded as genuine genes: (i) it had the significant similarity (E-value , 10 220 , Coverage . 60% and Identity . 50%) with annotated genes in bacteria beyond the same genus in the database, and it had the similar length with the counterpart (difference , 20%); (ii) it had counterpart in the cluster of orthologous groups (COG) database, i.e. it could be assigned within an existed COG cluster; (iii) it did not overlap annotated genes with any bases or it had a smaller E-value and a higher identity score against functional genes in the other genomes in the case of overlapping. This process has been standardized in this work. For each of the 10 strains, all parameters in the whole process were fixed.</p>
            <p>During the process of genome re-annotation for the 10 Neisseriaceae strains, we found an interesting phenomenon. In a specific genome, two adjacent ORFs, which are predicted as genes by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a2fe7a0373-software-simple-2">ZCURVE</rs> program, have the same function with known genes in the other species. The total length of the two ORFs just corresponds to that of the known counterparts or just a little different from them. Based on similarity scores, both of the two ORFs should be predicted as genes with the corresponding function. However, either of them is much shorter than the functional counterpart and could not constitute a homologue in the sense of length information. Perrodou et al. <ref type="bibr">43</ref> stated that unrecognized frameshifts, in-frame stop codons and sequencing errors often led to interrupted coding sequences. Very recently, Sharma et al. <ref type="bibr">44</ref> performed a pilot study on bacterial genes with disrupted ORFs. Their results indicated that many disrupted genes likely utilized the nonstandard decoding mechanisms: programmed ribosomal frameshifting and programmed transcriptional realignment. Given that our recognized adjacent ORFs have identical functions, they should originate from the disruption of a longer gene by a frameshift or an in-frame stop codon and rarely by the sequencing error. Numbers of disrupted ORFs are listed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and details of them are illustrated in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S4</ref>. Totally, 111 disrupted ORFs (or partial genes) were identified in six strains of the genus Neisseria and two in L. hongkongensis.According to Sharma et al., <ref type="bibr">44</ref> some of the disrupted ORFs still encode proteins. Consistent with this, both of the disrupted ORFs LHK_A0007 (newly predicted) and LHK_02777 (originally annotated) are found to be transcribed in L. hongkongensis cells by the PCR experiment. Further wet experiment on functions of the other disrupted ORFs would be interesting.</p>
            <p>When annotating this genome, only one ab initio gene finder was used. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> Usually, two or more ab initio programmes are used in annotating the other bacterial genomes. Based on the very abnormal gene density of the strain, we suppose that there may still be non-coding ORFs, besides the 56 ones excluded by us. Besides the annotation method and sequencing time, some other factors also cause the different extent of errors. For example, genes in high G þ C bacterial genomes are shown to be difficultly predicted with high accuracy and this is caused by the fact that many long ORFs appear in this type of genomes. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> In addition, the genome could be difficultly predicted accurately if there are only distantly related species in the public databases. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> We should note that there still probably are noncoding ORFs and missed genes after the present updated annotation in the 10 Neisseriaceae strains. To assure reliable results, we picked up only those sequences with very higher similarities when identifying missed genes and we used the method with lower specificity when excluding non-coding ORFs. In addition, some thoroughly new genes, which have not significant similarities with any known genes, may be found by combing ab initio programme and wet experimental validation. However, the 106 newly found genes are those having similar counterparts based on latest databases. Also note that different detailed methods may be used to check the annotations of the other bacterial genomes, although the present systematic method has shown to be effective and reliable. For example, the recently developed ab initio gene finder <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a2fe7a0373-software-simple-3">Prodigal</rs>, <ref type="bibr">32</ref> which has lower false positives could replace or jointly used with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a2fe7a0373-software-6">ZCURVE</rs> <rs corresp="#a2fe7a0373-software-6" resp="#annotator8" type="version">1.0</rs>. Here, we used only the latter because the use of both of them generates basically consistent results (data not shown). The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a2fe7a0373-software-simple-6">RPGM</rs> program, <ref type="bibr">39</ref> which is also based on the graphical representation of the DNA sequence, could be chosen as an alternative to eliminate non-coding ORFs.</p>

            <p>Over the past 4 years, researchers have completed several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to map underlying common susceptibility variants for coronary disease. In parallel with GWASs of other complex diseases, it was soon apparent that typical effect sizes for individual singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were fairly small, so large sample sizes would be required for reliable gene mapping. This has encouraged collaboration between individual research groups and led to the formation of consortia to pool the results of GWASs using meta-analysis techniques. Progress has been facilitated by the availability of phased haplotype training sets (notably, from the HapMap project: http ://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/phasing) and the accompanying genotype imputation software (for example, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b5e5041b9a-software-0">MACH</rs>: <rs corresp="#b5e5041b9a-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="url">www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html</rs> or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b5e5041b9a-software-1">IMPUTE</rs>: <rs corresp="#b5e5041b9a-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="url">mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/impute_v2.html</rs>). These population genetic resources and statistical genetic tools provide an efficient solution to the fact that individual GWASs are often carried out on different SNP arrays with variable SNP overlap.</p>

Group (treatment history: untreated vs previously treated) served as the between-subject variable, and time (pre, post, follow-up) as the within-subject factor. A significant impact of treatment history can be seen in a significant interaction between group and time. Variables (baseline HDRS-17 and baseline WHOglobal) that had demonstrated baseline differences between both groups (untreated/previously treated) were included as covariates into the analyses, also the variable intervention group (decoupling/PMR). Assumptions for all analyses with GLM-RM were checked in terms of Box's test of equality of covariance matrices, Mauchly's test of sphericity, and Levene's test of equality of error variances. All assumptions were met, with the exception of a significant Box's test for the HDRS-17 and a significant Mauchly's test for the GSI (ITT and completers' analysis), which was considered with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction. Effect sizes (partial η 2 ) were calculated (0.01 small effect, 0.06 medium effect, and 0.14 large effect size). <ref type="bibr">41</ref> All statistical calculations were performed using the software package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator16" type="software" xml:id="d67a6b6b37-software-0">SPSS</rs> (Version <rs corresp="#d67a6b6b37-software-0" resp="#annotator16" type="version">22.0</rs>).

            <p>To do that, H index of a given interleukin was divided by the number of years since publication for the oldest paper included in the H index. A index is the mean number of citations of the papers included in H index <ref type="bibr">(Jin et al., 2007)</ref>. This indicator was generated simultaneously to H index using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a8b8fbdda4-software-simple-0">WOS</rs> software package.</p>

One-Way ANOVA was used to detect differences amongst the groups. To account for the non-normal distribution of the data, all data were sorted by rank status prior to ANOVA statistical analysis. Tukey's test was used to compare the means of the ranks among the groups. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Because of this high variation, no statistically significant differences were identified between the 39 interleukins. However, it can still be observed that a higher number of articles were found for interleukins 1-18 than for other interleukins. After an analysis of the found articles, we identified several articles which were not linked to the interleukin assessed in the search. These articles can be considered as false positive results and were consequently excluded for further analyses. A list of selected articles was then constituted for each interleukins and each species (supplementary <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). In some cases, the difference in the number of articles was quite important. For instance, in bovine IL1, from 271 articles, 223 were kept. These differences illustrate the necessity to check articles one by one.</p>

            <p>This cross-sectional descriptive analytic study was based on 67 women in the age range of 36 to 92 years old who were referred to the Radiology Department of Mashhad Dental School. All of them had a panoramic radiography in their orders and none of the participants was known to have any prior fracture and systemic disease that would affect bone metabolism (chronic renal osteodystrophy, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, gastrointestinal disease, paget's disease or rheumatoid arthritis). They were not using specific drugs or hormones (corticosteroids, cyclosporine, heparin, estrogen, progesterone, androgen and excess thyroid hormone). The data regarding age and BMI (body mass index) was obtained by questionnaire. All the panoramic radiographs were taken with PM 2002 CC apparatus (Planmeca Oy, Asentajankatu 6, 00880 Helsinki, Finland) by a single operator (AB). The position of the head was standardized as much as possible and also the exposure factors (kVp, mA) were regulated for each patient. To have similar density and contrast in all radiographs, we used both AGFA Dentus panoramic film (Heraeus Kulzer, Belgium) and Kodak screens (Kodak Lanex Regular Screen, Eastman Kodak Company, USA). Processing of the films was automatically performed by <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d35b6dbf9c-software-0">Pro- tec processor</rs> (<rs corresp="#d35b6dbf9c-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">PROTEC medical systems</rs>, Stuttgart, Germany). For examination of the bone mineral density, DXA (Dual Energy Xray Absorptiometry) scans were performed with Osteocore 2 (MEDILINK, France). This technique is widely accepted as the "gold standard" method of clinical bone mineral measurements <ref type="bibr">[9,10]</ref>. DXA itself is subject to some minor inaccuracy in BMD measurement <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. Precision of DXA ranges from 0.55 to 5% [11]. Sixty-seven panoramic radiographs were analyzed for MCI, MI and PMI. According to Jowitt et al <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, "MCI is classification of the appearance of the mandibular inferior cortex distal to the mental foramen, which includes the following criteria: C1: The endosteal margin of the cortex is even and sharp on both sides of the mandible. <ref type="figure">(Fig 2)</ref>. All the measurements were made in millimeters (0.1 mm variation) with calipers by the same investigator (AB). The indices were measured bilaterally and the mean was recorded for each patient. When only one foramen was visible, the measurements were done only on that side <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. The information on age and BMD statuses of the patients was blinded to the examiner in order to eliminate information bias. Afterwards we gave the patients their radiographs and referred them to Toos Bone Densitometry Center for BMD testing. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients to carry out bone densitometry as a part of the study on osteoporosis. BMD testing was per-The endosteal margin has semilunar defects (resorption cavities) with cortical residues one to three layers thick on one or both sides. C3: The endosteal margin consists of thick cortical residues and is clearly porous.Since the acquired AZ, sensitivity, and specificity were low in each cutoff threshold, we used several cutoff points to determine the sensitivity and specificity.</p>

            <p>DCE-MRI to determine Gadomer-17 microvascular clearance. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed to determine the clearance of macromolecular tracers. The MR contrast agent Gadomer-17 has a molecular weight of 17 kDa, but due to its dendrimeric structure, its Stokes radius is as for globular proteins of molecular weight 35 kDa <ref type="bibr">(Misselwitz et al. 2001)</ref>. The contrast agent was injected over 15 s during scanning through a catheter in the tail vein after acquisition of 30 baseline images. For the ANP study, 0.4 mmol Gadomer kg À1 (diluted 1 : 4 in saline) was injected. In the rolipram study, 0.2 mmol Gadomer kg À1 was injected. The MRI was performed using a horizontal bore 7T small animal MRI instrument (PharmaScan; Bruker Corporation, Ettlingen, Germany), equipped with dedicated mouse bed and head coil. DCE-MRI data were obtained with a T1-weighted FLASH sequence (Fast Low Angle Shot) with a flip angle of 25°, repetition time and echo time of 13.77 and 2.52 ms respectively. A total of 600-1200 axial images through the masseter muscle were acquired with a sampling interval of 0.99 s, with a slice thickness of 1 mm, field of view of 2.5 cm and acquisition matrix of 96 9 96. A separate group of animals (n = 9) was used to determine the signal over time in large supplying vessels to the head to estimate the arterial input function (AIF). An oblique sagittal slice was positioned over the carotid arteries, and 1200 T 1 -weighted (same acquisition parameters as above) with a sampling interval of 0.99 s were acquired. The signal intensity over time was acquired in a region of interest of the internal masseter muscle using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="be5b831f94-software-1">Nordic Image Control and Evaluation (nICE</rs>; <rs corresp="#be5b831f94-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Nordic Imaging Lab AS</rs>, Bergen, Norway).

The rate constant (0.0063 s À1 ) for Gadomer-17 was equal for all animals based on the estimation of the AIF above. The rate constants were estimated using blind deconvolution as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Taxt et al. 2012)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Differences between groups were tested with one-way ANOVA with subsequent post hoc testing using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="be5b831f94-software-3">GRAPHPAD INSTAT</rs> (<rs corresp="#be5b831f94-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GraphPad Software</rs>, La Jolla, CA, USA). Twotailed t-tests were used when comparing only two groups. When testing ANP-effects, one-tailed testing was used as extensive studies by others and us have failed to demonstrate any case when ANP decreases endothelial permeability. The Mann-Whitney twotailed U-test (http://elegans.som.vcu.edu/~leon/stats/ utest.html) was used to assess whether endothelial slit calibre or the magnitude of endothelial junctional complex differed significantly between samples from Wt and Epac1 À/À mice, as such data are not normally distributed. Values are generally given as mean AE SEM.</p>

            <p>The dose proportionality for loxapine was examined across the dose groups using the power model (linear regression of log AUC inf vs log dose). A slope of 1.00 would indicate "perfect" dose proportionality (double the dose ¼ double the exposure).

A phylogenetic tree was constructed later using first 10 hits from NCBI <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="a68e79310d-software-simple-1">BLASTN</rs> search results and the query sequence using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a68e79310d-software-1">Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis</rs> version <rs corresp="#a68e79310d-software-1" resp="#annotator19" type="version">4.1</rs> <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref>. The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbour-joining method. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 500 replicates was taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analysed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in &lt;50% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete Deletion option). There were a total of 365 positions in the final dataset.</p>
            <p>We used linear regression analysis to test the associations between selected independent variables (fungal status, and eosinophil and lymphocyte percentages) and forced midexpiratory flow (FEF25-75%) % predicted as the dependent variable. All linear regression models also took into account the covariates age, smoking status (current versus former or never) and duration of employment. In addition to testing models in which only one of the independent predictors of interest was included along with the adjusting covariates, we also tested models including both fungal status and either eosinophil or lymphocyte percentage in the same model. We did so in order to assess the potential mediation of any fungal association with lung function by the presence of sputum eosinophils or lymphocytes. Because sputum eosinophil and lymphocyte percentages were strongly correlated with one another (r=0.72, p&lt;0.01) and both inversely correlated with the percent of macrophages (r= −0.63 and r= −0.55, respectively; both p&lt;0.01), we did not include any of these in multivariate models. Eosinophil and lymphocyte percentages, however, were only weakly negatively correlated with the percent neutrophils (r= −0.22 ( p&lt;0.05) and r= −0.24 ( p&lt;0.10), respectively), allowing us to test whether inclusion of that variable had a substantive impact on the mediation by eosinophils of the association of fungal contamination with lung function.

            <p>Out of the targeted population of 79 males, we did not study those who did not provide consent (n=7), did not include those ineligible based on current antibiotic use (n=4) and excluded those without reproducible quality spirometry (n=8) or who were unable to expectorate adequate sputum samples (n=6). We ultimately analysed data for 54 (68%) wood process workers employed at the four targeted worksites. Of those studied, 19 (35%) produced a sputum sample in which fungus was detected, while 35 (65%) were sputum fungus negative. In the genomic fungal characterisation, hits generated using standard search parameters indicated the fungus belonged to the genus Candida.

            <p>It is also interesting to find out whether the activities of downstream components of SOS2-SOS3 complex oscillates and coincides with diurnally regulated SOS2 and SOS3 transcripts. One of the downstream components, regulated by this complex is CCR1 (cold-circadian rhythm-RNA binding1) which encodes a Gly-rich RNA-binding protein. CCR1 has similar expressionRNA extraction and northern blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted from tissue using TRIzol method as per the manufacturer's instructions (T9424; Sigma-Aldrich). Northern blots were prepared using 20 μg total RNA. Appropriate probes [partial for OsSOS1(AK065608) corresponding to its N-terminal part and full length for other genes; OsSOS2 (AK102270); OsSOS3 (AK101368); OsTOC1 (AK111828)] were amplified using the primers listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and radiolabeled using the DecaLabel™ DNA labeling kit, (K0621; Fermentas). To avoid any error due to unequal loading of RNA samples, same blot was re-probed each time with different gene probes after washing. Northern blots were hybridized at 65°C in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.1% SDS and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 16-18 h. Membrane was washed twice in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each at 65°C and scanned on phosphorimager using the software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="b07c9027db-software-simple-0">Fujifilm Image Reader</rs>.

            <p>Patients. The design of the clinical trial has been previously described. <ref type="bibr">49</ref> Briefly, our single-arm trial used induction gemcitabine (1 g/m 2 ) on day 1 and day 8 and carboplatin (AUC = 5) on day 1 given at 4-week intervals for two cycles. This was followed by weekly carboplatin (AUC = 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m 2 ) with concurrent conformal radiation (dose = 74 Gy ± 5%) administered over 40 daily fractions. Plasma was collected at baseline (Time 0), after induction at week 9 (Time 1), and afterindividual mean concentrations were recorded. The intraassay and day-to-day analytic coefficients of variation were less than 5% for each analyte <ref type="table">(Table S1)</ref>. Statistics. The plasma concentrations of Kyn and Trp, as well as Kyn/Trp ratios approximated a parametric distribution. Therefore, data were presented as means ± SD. Due to the small sample size, the associations between serum biomarker levels and clinicopathologic variables were evaluated with Wilcoxon ranksum and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Wilcoxon signed rank was used to compare between time points. Correlation was estimated using Spearman's rho. Survival curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. To address the experimental hypothesis, the statistical population was equally divided into "hig" and "low" patients using the median Kyn/Trp value as pre-specified cut-point. The effects of biomarkers on PFS and OS were evaluated using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and Cox proportionalhazards regression models. All tests performed were two-tailed.

            <p>To illustrate the application of our general framework, we develop an efficient algorithm for computing the likelihood of a tree under the threshold model of <ref type="bibr">Wright (1934)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Felsenstein (2005, 2012)</ref>. We also show how to infer marginal trait densities at ancestral nodes. We have implemented these algorithms and used them to study evolution of extrafloral nectaries (EFN) on an 839-taxon phylogeny of <ref type="bibr">Marazzi et al. (2012)</ref>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="dde861f54b-software-simple-0">MATLAB</rs> code for computing the threshold likelihood has been posted on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="dde861f54b-software-simple-1">MATLAB</rs> Central and complete <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="dde861f54b-software-simple-2">MATLAB</rs> code for all analyses and simulations can be found in supplementary material, Supplementary Material online.</p>
            <p>While the level of convergence for both algorithms is correct, the accuracy of the method based on Simpson's method is far worse. When a branch length is short, the transition density becomes highly peaked, as does the function being integrated. Such functions are difficult to approximate with piecewise quadratics, and Simpson's method can fail miserably. Indeed, for N &lt; 50, we would often observe estimated probabilities equal to 0, or estimates greater than 1! (These were omitted from the plots). Although we can always bound estimates computed by the algorithm, a sounder approach is to improve the integration technique. This we did using the Gaussian kernel method, and the result was far improved accuracy for little additional computation. For the remainder of the experiments with this model we used the Gaussian kernel method when carrying out numerical integration. <ref type="bibr">Marazzi et al. (2012)</ref> describe AIC comparisons between their precursor model and a conventional binary trait model. We extend this comparison to include the threshold model. This is a one parameter model, the parameter being the value of the liability at the root. We used the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="dde861f54b-software-simple-3">MATLAB</rs> command <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dde861f54b-software-simple-4">fmin- search</rs> with multiple starting points to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for this value. The resulting log-likelihood was log?L ¼ À240:6, giving an AIC of 483.2. This compares to an AIC of 507.4 for the (two parameter) binary character model and an AIC of 495.4 for the (one parameter) precursor model of <ref type="bibr">Marazzi et al. (2012)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Forty 3-month-old intact Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Research Unit, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They were acclimatized at the local vivarium for one week (room temperature, 12-hour light/dark cycle). The rats were housed singly in plastic cages with free access to tap water and standard rat chow (Gold Coin, Port Klang, Malaysia). They were stratified into five groups using random numbers generated by statistical software. Orchidectomy was performed in the orchidectomized, AnTT, and testosterone groups. A shamoperated group underwent similar surgical treatment but their testes were not removed. The baseline group was sacrificed without undergoing any surgical treatment or intervention. The AnTT group received AnTT daily (60 mg/kg body weight, oral gavage) for 8 weeks, while the other groups received an equal volume of the olive oil vehicle. The testosterone group received weekly testosterone enanthate injections (7 mg/kg body weight, intramuscularly) for 8 weeks while the other groups received an equal volume of the peanut oil vehicle. Treatment was initiated a week after orchidectomy. The weight of each rat was monitored weekly using a digital scale (Tanita Model 1,144, Tokyo, Japan) and recorded to the nearest 1 g. At the end of the treatment period, the rats were euthanized using diethyl ether (HmbG Chemicals ® , Hamburg, Germany), after which their femoral and tibial bones were harvested. After the soft tissue was removed, the bones were either stored in 10% formalin solution for histomorphometric and μCT evaluation, or at -70°C for study of gene expression. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the animal ethics committee at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (Code FP/FAR/2012/IMA/18-July/445-July-2012-April-2014).Contouring was performed using a semiautomated method to select the trabecular region.

            <p>The region assessed was the secondary spongiosa in the metaphyseal region, which is 3-7 mm from the lowest point of the growth plate and 1 mm from the lateral cortex. Structural parameters were investigated by an automated method using an image analyzer (<rs corresp="#f8c57aa0b9-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">MediaCybernetics</rs> <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f8c57aa0b9-software-2">Image Pro-Plus</rs>, Rockville, MD, USA). Dynamic parameters were investigated using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i, Tokyo, Japan) and measured manually using a Weibel grid. The structural parameters measured included trabecular bone volume, thickness, number, and separation. Dynamic parameters measured included single-labeled surface, double-labeled surface, mineralizing rate, mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate.</p>
            <p>Distribution of the data was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and all data were found to be normally distributed. Oneway analysis of variance, with either Tukey's or Dunnett's T3 as the post hoc test, was used to detect significant differences in the variables of interest between the study groups.

We therefore defined our regions of interest as the clusters of FWE corrected Po0.05 significant activation within the control group activation maps <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>, and used <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c1522259a0-software-simple-3">MarsBar</rs> <ref type="bibr">34</ref> to extract mean activations for the primary contrast (happy minus neutral and fearful minus neutral) for each subject for each region of interest. For illustration, we plotted these FWE corrected activation maps onto the canonical Montreal Neuroimaging Institute (MNI) 152 template brain image <ref type="bibr">33</ref> using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c1522259a0-software-9">SPM</rs> <rs corresp="#c1522259a0-software-9" resp="#annotator5" type="version">8</rs>, and onto a three-dimensional-rendered template brain image using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c1522259a0-software-10">MRI- cron</rs> software (<rs corresp="#c1522259a0-software-10" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/mricron</rs>/). <ref type="bibr">35</ref> We conducted analyses of variance within <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c1522259a0-software-11">PASW Statistics</rs> <rs corresp="#c1522259a0-software-11" resp="#annotator5" type="version">18</rs> to measure the overall effect of group on the primary contrast activation data (happy minus neutral and fearful minus neutral) for each region of interest. Age and sex were modeled as covariates in all analyses. Similarly, we used analyses of variance to investigate autism versus control, control versus sibling and autism versus sibling differences, again taking age and sex as covariates. We investigated linear trend effects across the three groups using polynomial regression, and where a statistically significant linear effect was found, we examined the quadratic effect to confirm that this was nonsignificant. We plotted the mean activation contrast estimate (expressed in arbitrary units ± standard error of the mean) for the three study groups.</p>
            <p>Neural response to faces versus fixation crosses. These findings demonstrate a clear linear progression across autism, sibling and control groups for atypical fMRI activation to happy versus neutral faces. To address the question as to whether the neural basis for this marker is an atypical neural response to happy faces, neutral faces or to both, we used the same brain regions defined by the significant activations within controls to happy versus neutral faces (comprising the 11 clusters listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> Differences between 'unaffected' siblings and controls with no family history of autism in the neural response to happy versus neutral faces.

Nevertheless, we observed some variability in channel behavior. Most currents behaved as those ionic potassium (K + ) currents depicted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> A. Large amplitude currents could be routinely measured, with activation that speeded up with depolarizing voltages, as has been reported for other voltage-gated K + ion channels and previously for Kv1.2 <ref type="bibr">(Scholle et al., 2004)</ref>. Occasionally, faster onset currents could be recorded, which also activated over a more negative voltage range (not depicted). These less common currents are related to the more typical ones shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> by an approximate 15-mV voltage shift, both in kinetics and steady-state properties. This observation is similar to what has been shown to occur to Kv1.2 in mammalian cell expression systems <ref type="bibr">(Rezazadeh et al., 2007)</ref> and to the Kv1.2-Kv2.1 paddle chimera <ref type="bibr">(Schmidt et al., 2012)</ref>, where fast and slow populations of channels can be distinguished. In our recording conditions (symmetric K + ), the I-V curve shows a negative slope region, indicative of voltage-dependent activation <ref type="figure">Fig. 1 B)</ref>. The voltage dependence of activation was estimated from the amplitude of tail currents at the end of a depolarizing pulse. The normalized magnitude of the tail current is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> C, along with a fit to a fourth-power Boltzmann function, with an apparent gating charge per subunit of 2.7 e o .</p>

            <p>Purple urchin and sand dollar embryos were imaged with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Radiance 2000; Bio-Rad Laboratories) mounted on a compound microscope (E800; Nikon) using a 40× 1.3 NA Plan-Fluor oil lens. Room temperature was maintained at 14-17°C, which is tolerated well by both species. Some experiments were conducted on a spinning disc confocal microscope (CARV; BD) consisting of an inverted microscope (TE2000; Nikon) with a 60× 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil lens and a 60× 1.2 NA Plan-Apochromat water lens, the CARV spinning disc head, and a camera (ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu), controlled by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="cf72a68aa1-software-0">MetaMorph</rs> software (<rs corresp="#cf72a68aa1-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">MDS Analytical Technologies</rs>). X. laevis embryos were imaged on a laser scanning confocal microscope (1024; Bio-Rad Laboratories) mounted on an Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 63× 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil objective.</p>
            <p>Sand dollar eggs were fertilized within their jelly by the addition of 1-2 ml of sperm diluted 1:10,000 in FSW. 10-15 min after insemination, fertilized eggs were deprived of their jelly and vitelline envelopes by one passage in and out of a hand-pulled mouth pipet cut to slightly larger furrow. The latter was measured by drawing a line from the inflection point of the curved cell surface during midfurrow ingression to the inflection point on the opposite side, and measuring the intersection with a line drawn along the spindle axis.

            <p>Analysis of Rho zone width As described previously <ref type="bibr">(Bement et al., 2005)</ref>, single frames from equivalent stages of furrow ingression were selected from sequences at medial planes within cells expressing GFP-rGBD alone or with 3C-EMTB. A freehand line selection was drawn along the cell edge and then straightened using<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="cf72a68aa1-software-simple-10">ImageJ</rs>. Intensities were plotted along a 7-pixel-wide band covering the cell edge, yielding data points (position and intensity) spanning the Rho zone in the furrow. Intensity data were imported into <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="cf72a68aa1-software-2">Mathematica</rs> (<rs corresp="#cf72a68aa1-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Wolfram Re- search, Inc</rs>.) and fit with a Gaussian curve plus a quadratic equation with small coefficients. The Gaussian curve fits the Rho zone, whereas the quadratic fits the background cortical signal level. The width of the Rho zone was taken as twice the standard deviation of the fit Gaussian curve, which is equivalent to slightly less than the peak width at half maximum height. Total intensity of the Rho zone was taken as the integral under the Gaussian curve from the center plus or minus two standard deviations, minus the integral in the baseline fit over the same region. Zone widths plotted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> B were normalized by the pole-to-pole distance in each measured cell. Significance was judged using the mean difference test in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="cf72a68aa1-software-simple-13">Mathematica</rs>.</p>
            <p>Sand dollar zygotes were bisected either freehand using a fine glass needle or using a needle mounted on a hanging-joystick oil hydraulic micromanipulator (Narishige Group). Bisection was conducted after pronuclear fusion for uninjected eggs, or 45 min after fertilization (and after injection) for injected eggs. Bisection yields half zygotes, which by random chance include some pairs in which one half contains the nucleus and a single centrosome and the other half contains only a centrosome. Such pairs were recognized by differential interference contrast microscopy or by staining live cells with Hoechst 33342. Anucleate, centrosomecontaining cytoplasts conduct orderly centrosome duplication and separation on a normal schedule; the nucleated half skips first cleavage, then develops normally as a tetraploid <ref type="figure">(Fig. 8 D)</ref>. Among EMTB-3G-expressing anucleate cytoplasts, we scored all cases in which either no furrows or discrete furrows formed (omitting cases in which the cytoplast strangled itself into the shape of a balloon animal, which we took to be a sign of poor health) as follows: for each centrosome pair in focus, we measured, at the time corresponding to anaphase, the distance between centrosomes and divided by the distance from the midpoint between them to the cell surface. We then scored cortical behavior into three categories: (1) no furrow or incoherent ruffling, (2) shallow furrow, or (3) deep or complete furrow. Significance was judged using the mean difference test in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="cf72a68aa1-software-simple-14">Mathematica</rs>.</p>

            <p>The study cohort used for our serum cytokine measurement studies included 40 subjects (26 females and 14 males; average age 22.5 6 15.6 years, range 5-53), with one or more islet autoantibodies. The median HbA 1c value in the autoantibody-positive group was 5.3 (range 4.5-6). Of these, 30 were positive for one autoantibody, 8 were positive for two autoantibodies, and 2 were positive for three autoantibodies. The control group included 40 autoantibody-negative individuals (21 females and 19 males) who were an average age of 14.0 6 9.2 years (range 5-43). PBMNC isolation. PBMNCs were freshly isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque Plus density centrifugation (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) of freshly drawn heparinized blood from autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative subjects. PBMNCs were washed twice with PBS (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and resuspended in endotoxin-free high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 100 units/mL penicillin/ streptomycin (both from Invitrogen Life Technologies), and 10% human AB serum (PAA Laboratories, New Bedford, MA). For flow cytometry analyses, PBMNCs were washed and resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer consisting of PBS (Invitrogen Life Technologies) plus 1% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide (both from Sigma-Aldrich). Analysis of DC and monocyte frequencies in the peripheral blood. PBMNCs were isolated from freshly drawn blood as described above. For mDC enumeration, we used APC-conjugated anti-cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1) C (mouse IgG2a, clone AD5-8E7, Miltenyi Biotech) plus APC-Alexa Fluor 750-conjugated anti-CD19 (mouse IgG1, clone HIB19, eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Staining with anti-CD19 was performed to exclude B cells expressing CD1C. For monocyte staining, we used pacific blue-conjugated anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody (mAb; mouse IgG2a, clone M5E2, BioLegend, San Diego, CA). For plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) subset staining, cells were surface stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated mAb directed against CD304 + (mouse IgG1, clone AD5-17F6, Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). Activation of PBMNCs with TLR ligands and intracellular cytokine and chemokine staining. PBMNCs were added to a 96-well round-bottom microtiter plates at a concentration of 1 3 10 6 /well in a total volume of 100 mL. For intracellular cytokine analysis, PBMNCs were incubated in the presence or absence of various purified TLR ligands and 1 mL/mL brefeldin A (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for 4 h, followed by staining for surface markers and intracellular cytokines. For intracellular cytokine staining, PBMNCs were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 ng/mL ultrapurified lipopolysaccharide (LPS; O111:B4; InvivoGen, San Diego, CA), 50 mg/mL polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly[I:C]; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 10 mg/mL R848 (Axxora, San Diego, CA) for 4 h, followed by staining for DC and monocyte surface markers, followed by staining for IL-1b and IL-6, as previously published <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. All TLR ligands were dissolved in Dulbecco's PBS and stored in aliquots at -20°C until used. Serum cytokine expression levels. Twenty-five microliters of serum were used for measuring levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), interferon (IFN)-a, IFN-g, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-17A, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL-10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 using the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) cytokine multiplex kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (MSD, Gaithersburg, MD). The detection sensitivity of the MSD method is considered to be greater than other systems <ref type="bibr">(14,15)</ref>. The diluent included in the kit contains blockers for the neutralization of heterophilic antibodies present in human serum. We measured levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-1a, IL-1b, IFN-a2, IFN-g, IL-6, IL-17A, CXCL-10, and MCP-1. The detection sensitivity limits for these cytokines are 120, 0.12, 0.3, 0.7, 1, 0.7, 0.4, and 3.5 pg/mL, respectively. The diluent MSD plates were read using the MSD SECTOR Imager 2400. Statistical analyses. Statistical differences in frequencies of freshly drawn mDCs, pDCs, and monocytes, as well as frequencies of monocytes and mDCsexpressing cytokines after TLR ligation in positive versus negative subjects, frequencies of monocytes and mDCs expressing cytokines in at-risk subjects positive for one versus more than one autoantibodies, cytokine responses based on age group, cytokine expression levels, and serum cytokine levels in subjects with one versus more than one autoantibodies were evaluated using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Associations between cell frequencies or cytokine levels and age were evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis. Age correction and ANOVA were applied when a significant association was observed. For statistical differences in serum cytokine levels between seropositive and seronegative subjects and to correct for the effect of age, cytokine concentrations were log-transformed to obtain approximately normally distributed measures and then analyzed using ANOVA. Values of P , 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

            <p>To measure dynamic balance ability, a star excursion balance test (SEBT) was conducted for each group, because of its high reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.88-0.96) <ref type="bibr">10)</ref>. For the SEBT, a cross-shaped line was drawn on the floor, with additional lines drawn 45° in eight directions. In this study, only three directions were used (anterior, posterolateral, and posteromedial), according to the study by <ref type="bibr">Hyong 11)</ref>. The measurements were conducted while the subjects set the heels of their dominant feet at the center point and stretched the feet in the anterior direction as much as possible while maintaining balance. The point where the big toe ended was marked. The posterolateral and posteromedial directions were measured in the same way. Each subject's measurements were taken three times, and the mean value was calculated for each group. In order to minimize errors due to differences in leg length between the subjects, the values were standardized using the formula: measured value/leg length × 100. For the leg length measurements, the distance between the anterior superior iliac spine of the medial malleolus and the tubercle of the shin was measured while the subject was in the supine position. Statistical analysis was conducted using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a64770e311-software-0">SPSS</rs> version <rs corresp="#a64770e311-software-0" resp="#annotator8" type="version">12.0</rs>, while one-way analysis of variance was used to compare dynamic balance ability among the three groups.

            <p>Participants were prepared for polysomnographic sleep monitoring using standardized techniques <ref type="bibr">34</ref> including six EEG sensors to measure brain wave activity placed according to the international system for electrode placement, <ref type="bibr">35</ref> two eye sensors to record horizontal eye movement (electrooculogram), and chin and tibialis anterior electromyogram sensors to assess muscle activity. Physiological signals were recorded using Nihon Kohden equipment (Foothill Ranch, CA, USA). Other instruments included a nasal airflow sensor, comfortable belts around the thorax and abdomen to monitor respiratory effort, a finger probe to assess pulse oximetry, and a microphone to monitor snoring. Each study session was digitally video recorded. The sleep records were scored according to standardized scoring criteria. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> The outcome measures of interest are as follows: TST, SE, time spent in stage N1, stage N2, stage N3, and stage R, and percent sleep period time spent in stage N1, stage N2, stage N3, and stage R. For data analysis, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="eb7c332ca4-software-0">SPSS</rs> version <rs corresp="#eb7c332ca4-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">20.0</rs> was used to perform all statistical analysis, and alpha was set at 0.05. Descriptive statistics were calculated. The data were analyzed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and Skewness and Kurtosis test, as well as Box plots and normal Q-Q plots. Independent t-tests were used to compare the sleep parameters of the individuals with stroke with the control participants when the assumption of normality was satisfied. Effect sizes were calculated as Cohen's d values. Because this is a pilot study, data are presented without correction for multiplicity. Due to the sex difference in the stroke sample, linear regression was used to study if sex predicts the outcome measure of interest after controlling for age which can be a confounding factor for change in sleep parameters. An exploratory analysis was performed using independent t-tests to compare the sleep characteristics and descriptive characteristics of individuals with left-sided MCA lesions (n=7) to those with right-sided MCA lesions (n=9). Alpha was set at 0.05.</p>

            <p>Multiple regression: Due to the possible clustering on operating surgeon, we used mixed linear regression models to estimate the intraclass correlation of the clustering on operating surgeon. We found that there was no statistically significant intraclass correlation. Thus, linear regression with robust standard errors using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="be5ef25d03-software-simple-0">STATA</rs> command "cluster (cluster variable)"was used-which relaxes the independence assumption and requires only that the observations should be independent across the clusters (STATA 2013). Overall satisfaction was treated as the outcome and comorbidities were treated as the independent variables. LOS, age group, and gender were coded as dummy variables <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>, and were tested for interactions between LOS and comorbidities. Statistically significant interactions were included in the final analysis.

It has been shown that a random variation exists between surgeons <ref type="bibr">(Randsborg et al. 2010)</ref>. We therefore checked to determine whether the operating surgeon should be included as a random variable, taking into account the random variation across surgeons using linear mixed-effect model analysis.</p>
            <p>The statistical assumptions for a linear mixed-effect model analysis apply to both the between-subjects and within-subjects effects. The between-subjects assumptions are the same as those in a standard regression analysis: the independence of scores, normality of the residuals, and equal variances (known as homogeneity of variance). As this was not the case, we applied cluster robust standard errors using the HubertWhite sandwich estimator. This relaxes the assumption of independence, thus producing "correct" standard errors (in the measurement sense) even if the observations are correlated. Even so, caution is needed in interpreting the results. In addition, the mixed model also assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, equality of variances of the difference scores for all pairs of scores at all levels of the within-subjects factor, and equal covariances for the between-subjects factor. This assumption is known as the sphericity assumption. Sphericity is especially important for mixed model analysis. Bartlett's test for sphericity was performed to test for this, and it showed no statistically significant departure from the sphericity assumption. Thus, we decided to assess the intraclass correlation of the model using a linear mixed model with robust standard errors-as the assumptions for this model appeared to be fulfilled. If a statistically significant intraclass correlation was evident, a mixed linear regression model was used; if not, then "normal" OLS linear regression with robust standard errors was used. As no significant intraclass correlation was found, a "normal" OLS linear regression with robust standard errors was performed and q-q normal plots were used to check for normality of the residuals of the model. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="be5ef25d03-software-2">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#be5ef25d03-software-2" resp="#annotator7" type="version">13</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="be5ef25d03-software-3">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#be5ef25d03-software-3" resp="#annotator7" type="version">17.1</rs> were used for the analyses.</p>

Textures of the samples were measured via neutron diffraction on the High Pressure Preferred Orientation (HIPPO) <ref type="bibr">27</ref> time-of-flight diffractometer at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Samples with a surface size of 1.5 cm 2 were mounted in a way that the Cu-Nb interfaces were perpendicular to the incoming neutron beam and the rolling direction of the sample was parallel with the notch. Five banks of detector panels set at 2h 5 150u, 120u, 90u, 60u, and 40u, respectively, were used to collect diffraction data, while each bank created a full rotation (with regards to the neutron beam direction) of detection coverage.

            <p>Because the spore solution of each strain presented different colors, at time zero, the initial O.D. values were distinctive to each culture in relation to the control culture. This coloration difference (defined here as "specific color influence factor" for each strain) was calculated as follows:Next, the influence factor specific to each strain was subtracted from all O.D values from 0 to 72 h of each culture, in order to express the real growth of the strains. The analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="a5fe46e9f2-software-2">BioEstat</rs> <rs corresp="#a5fe46e9f2-software-2" resp="#annotator5" type="version">4.0</rs> software) was applied using the data obtained, and confirmed by Dunn post hoc test, which was used to verify the significance of the strain's growth compared to the control and among the strains (5). The experimental results were separated into four classes based on the time taken for growth: I) 0 to 18 h, II) 18 to 36 h, III) 36 to 54 h, and IV) 54 to 72 h. The results were analyzed by triangulation of the statistical data with the differences of O.D. per period.</p>

            <p>In this study, auditory stream segregation was assessed using a method described by <ref type="bibr">Best 13 (2004)</ref>.In this method, a 2-trial forcedchoice procedure was employed. The subjects were presented with 2 simultaneous tones of different frequencies (i.e., 500 Hz and 800 Hz) and were asked to judge the relative location of the pair by indicating whether the higher tone was to the left or right of the lower tone, on the right hand side of the subjects <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). The subjects' head was positioned in the center. The subjects were instructed to keep their heads in this position for the duration of the recording process (about 15 min). Testing took place using 3 reference locations on a horizontal plane: 0°, 30°, and 60°. For each reference location, 10 test locations were chosen on the basis of preliminary testing. In each trial, a pair of concurrent stimuli was presented. One stimulus corresponded to 1 of the reference locations, and the second stimulus was presented from 1 of the 10 test locations displaced in either azimuth. Prior to data acquisition, the subjects completed training blocks to ensure that they were able to detect the targets. Using a criterion of 75% correct in each test location, we measured the concurrent minimum audible angle. Stimuli were generated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="c86eb490de-software-0">MATLAB</rs> (<rs corresp="#c86eb490de-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">The MathWorks</rs>, Natick, MA) and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="c86eb490de-software-1">Sound Forge</rs> software (v.<rs corresp="#c86eb490de-software-1" resp="#annotator25" type="version">10</rs> by<rs corresp="#c86eb490de-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Sonic Foundry</rs>) with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. The stimuli were presented through headphones (TDH 39) via an audiometer, at 50 dB SL.</p>
            <p>All the analyses were conducted using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c86eb490de-software-2">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)</rs>, version <rs corresp="#c86eb490de-software-2" resp="#annotator25" type="version">16</rs>. Due to the relatively small group numbers in the study, the data did not meet normality assumptions in general. Therefore, nonparametric statistics (MannWhitney U) were used to compare the betweengroup differences. The Pearson correlation was employed to measure the degree of association between working memory capacity and the localization tests. The significance level adopted was 0.05 (5%), with confidence intervals of 95%.</p>

            <p>Seventy-one samples from 26 DCUs and 36 samples from 15 outlets of the water distribution pipework within the departments (three independent water lines) of the Bernhard Gottlieb University Clinic of Dentistry were included in this evaluation. The DCUs were exclusively supplied with drinking water from the Vienna water supply system. All DCUs are equipped with an integrated disinfection device. The following DCU types are being used in the various departments: Sirona C3 (Sirona Dental Systems, Bensheim, Germany), Kavo 1062C and 1065T, 1066R (KaVo Dental GmbH, Biberach/Riß, Germany). The setup of the integrated disinfection system shall be described for the type Sirona C3 as representative example. The system consists of a tank being filled with a disinfectant containing hydrogen peroxide and silver ions -Dentosept P (1.41% H 2 O 2 and 25 ppm silver ions) / Dentosept PL (1.41% H 2 O 2 and 17 ppm silver ions) (Metasys Medizintechnik GmbH, Innsbruck; Austria) and Oxygenal 6 (6% H 2 O 2 ) (KaVo Dental GmbH, Biberach/Riß, Germany) -under control of a level switch. Via a flow limiter with solenoid valve the disinfectant is introduced into the water-filled mixing tank and its fluid is flushed through the lines of the dental unit. Samples of 500 ml (corresponding to the bottle marking) were collected in sterile plastic bottles with screw cap containing sodium thiosulfate (Sterilin ® , Caerphilly, United Kingdom). The samples collected from the DCU were taken prior to taking the DCU in operation, after 2 minutes of waterflow lead time. Sampling was always done in the same sequence, starting from the connection end of the handpiece, the ultrasonic scaler and the orifice of the air/water spray. Samples were collected from 10 DCUs at 4 different time points, from 15 DCUs at 2 different time points and from 1 dental chair at one time point. Water samples from the water distribution pipework within the departments were also collected prior to taking the DCU in operation. Samples were taken from 4 pipes at 4 time points, from 9 pipes at 2 time points, and from 2 pipes at one time point.The water samples were tested for aerobic heterotrophic colony-forming units using the pour plate method with amounts of 1 ml and 1 ml of samples at 1:100 dilution. Two different agar media were applied: initially, a yeast extract agar (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) at 36°C for 48 h ± 4 h and 22°C for 72 h ± 4 h according to EN ISO 6222 <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, secondly, the R2A agar (Merck, Darmstadt. Germany) at 35°C for 72 h ± 4 h and 120 h ± 4 h as well as at 22°C for 120 h ± 4 h and 168 h ± 4 h according to US-EPA <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. For the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa a membrane filter method was used. Portions of 100 ml were filtered through filters with a pore size of 0.45 µm and transferred onto Pseudomonas selective agar with supplement (Oxoid, Hampshire, United Kingdom) for an incubation time of 48 h ± 4 h at 36°C according to EN ISO 16266 <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Testing for Legionella spp. was also done by using a membrane filter method. Portions of 10 and 100 ml were filtered though black filters with a pore size of 0.45 µm, which were transferred onto a GVPC-medium (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Additionally, two portions of 0.5 ml were plated on selective and non-selective Legionella agar. All plates were incubated at 36°C for at least 168 h ± 4 h according to EN ISO 11731-2 <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. Differentiation of Legionella pneumophila serogroup (Sg) 1, Sg 2-15 and non-pneumophila Legionella was done using test sera (Oxoid, Hampshire, United Kingdom). Isolates of Sg 1 were further subdivided into nine subtypes by application of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) using the "Dresden Panel" <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. Molecular typing of L. pneumophila was performed using the consensus sequence-based scheme (SBT) described by Gaia et al. <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> and the EWGLI (European Working Group for Legionella Infections) SBT database (version 3.0) <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. Isolates of non-pneumophila Legionella spp. were identified using a sequence-based classification scheme targeting the mip gene <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. The data were evaluated in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="c5b8ebac1b-software-0">SPSS</rs> -Version <rs corresp="#c5b8ebac1b-software-0" resp="#annotator7" type="version">16.0</rs> -(<rs corresp="#c5b8ebac1b-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, USA). Apart from frequency calculations (minimum, maximum, median and interquartile range), correlation according to Pearson were tested. For all statistical analyses, p-values &lt;0.05 were considered as significant.</p>

To compare the effects of the three supplements (on each outcome measure, over time), we used repeated-measures analysis of variance, and contingency table analysis, as appropriate. Cognisant that this exploratory study would likely have insufficient power for such analyses, however, we did some additional analyses. In fact, and beyond the previously reported 12-month data, <ref type="bibr">8</ref> we decided upon two strands of analysis: (a) between supplement group analysis over time: despite the small sample sizes, supplement groups were compared with each other, for changes in each outcome variable over the 3 years of the study. For interval outcome variables (MP, serum carotenoids, BCVA, CS), the method of analysis was repeatedmeasures analysis of variance, with time as a withinsubjects factor and supplement as a between-subjects factor; we used the Greenhouse-Geisser correction for lack of sphericity. Post hoc analysis, with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing, was used where appropriate. For categorical outcome variables (AMD grade), we used contingency table analysis to compare supplements; (b) within-supplement group changes in each outcome variable, over the 3 years of the study. We used paired t-tests analysis here.</p>

            <p>A cross-sectional study was conducted with foundry workers within the metallurgical industry (Metal Casting Process, Shell Molding Line; with shape-out tasks) in Sao Paulo, Brazil. All participants signed informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (protocol 0048.1.1186.000-10). All workers who performed their duties while exposed to high temperatures from ovens were selected to this study. Workers were excluded due to various reasons such as dismissal, sick leave, or refusal to participate. All participants performed spirometry (EasyOne TM, model 2001) according to the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society protocol (2005) at their workplace. The values are expressed as a percentage of the predicted values obtained in Brazilian subjects <ref type="bibr">15)</ref>. The measurement of peak expiratory flow was performed following three rapid exhalations by the patient (Mini Wright Standard with a flow between 60 and 800 l/min). The best result among them was used. Anthropometrics measure (height and weight) of the participants were performed using the Microlife brand, previously calibrated stadiometer (Sany). To evaluate the activity level of the workers, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form was used. The questions are related to the time spent engaging in physical activity in a typical week/habitual. People were considered active if they had accumulated more than 150 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity per week <ref type="bibr">16)</ref>. Then, a routine physical examination and evaluation of previous medical history; respiratory signs and symptoms, according to a respiratory disease's questionnaire; smoking history; and checklist were implemented. The dyspnea was assessed by Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea scale <ref type="bibr">17)</ref>. The foundry workers were classified according to exposure time in High (&gt;5 years) and Low exposure groups (≤ 5 years). A control group consisted of administrative area workers from the same industry. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was used to analyze the data distribution. The data were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis, mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni adjusted was used to determine whether there are significant differences between groups (α&lt;5%). The statistical analysis was performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e144cb2134-software-0">Sigma Stat</rs> software package, version <rs corresp="#e144cb2134-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">3.2</rs> (San Jose, EUA).</p>

            <p>Continuous variables were compared using Student t test and dichotomous variables using the chi-square test. Survival time was measured from the date of surgical resection to the date of death or last contact. Conventional clinical variables at the time of entry into the study and immunopositivity for PDI were analyzed to identify factors that influenced survival, as determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Stepwise, univariate, and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model to identify factors that influenced survival.

            <p>Web-based forms for EDC such as those developed by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-0">REDCap</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Harris et al., 2009)</ref> are extremely useful for either clinician-or self-assessment, allowing the subjects to answer the questions on their own time in the comfort of their own home over the internet, and the answers can be collated without the introduction of an extra transcription step. However, self-assessment may not be an option in some situations. In the case of psychiatric assessments, Frontiers in Neuroinformatics www.frontiersin.org the clinician researcher often must be the person either summarizing or making their best judgment about the subject's response in order to complete an assessment, as in conducting the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis <ref type="bibr">(Spitzer et al., 1992)</ref> or reporting the level of consciousness in a neurological assessment of a nearcomatose patient, for example. Interviewers cannot maintain eye contact or a comfortable interaction when there is a computer monitor between them, which is problematic in various studies; having the clinician turn away to type into a web browser may be disruptive to assessing body language cues or the flow of the interview. Electronic data capture methods for research that occurs in a medical institution to integrate health records with research records <ref type="bibr">(El Fadly et al., 2011)</ref> can depend on internet access during data collection and integration. EDC methods are also needed for studies that need to be performed at locations without internet access, remote rural areas, prisons, or mental health facilities that do not provide computing resources and may even block internet access. These problems make traditional web and desktop software impractical for many studies, which in turn keeps these more distributed clinical studies tethered to paper forms. <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-6" resp="#curator" type="publisher">REDCap</rs> is one of the few to address this, with a "<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-6">REDCap Mobile</rs>" version which allows researchers in these situations to have encrypted laptops with a push-pull relationship to the centralized <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-3">REDCap</rs> database to allow data collection while off-line <ref type="bibr">(Borlawsky et al., 2011)</ref>.</p>
            <p>A list of current EDC packages are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, with their published characteristics. Current web-based EDC solutions suffer from two primary disadvantages, as can be seen: The first is the need to have internet access in order to function, which makes them unusable in remote situations such as those noted above, with the exception of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-4">REDCap</rs>. The second is that many of them are integrated into select data management systems. To use a specific EDC system one must also use a specific database and presumably port any pre-existing data into it. This is less attractive when the research group has a mature data management system in place for their neuroimaging data, and is looking to add EDC for clinical assessments.</p>
            <p>The solution is a system that combines the automated data capture of web-based self-assessment with the dynamics of a clinician's expertise and needs, and the abilities to work off-line until interface with an arbitrary database is needed. The <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-7" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Mind Research Network (MRN)</rs> has developed a software tool for the real-time acquisition and validation of clinical assessments in remote environments: The <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-7">clinical assessment and remote administration tablet (CARAT)</rs>. We have developed this tool on a <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-70" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-70">Windows</rs> PC tablet system, and it has been used successfully to collect and administer clinical assessments in several large-scale studies. It has proven to be incredibly valuable in confirming that data collection across multiple research groups is performed similarly, quickly, and with accountability for incomplete datasets. Here we present its specifications and current availability, focusing on its use in conjunction with the Functional Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) multi-site neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia, and the FBIRN Human Imaging Databases <ref type="bibr">(Keator et al., 2008)</ref>; and in conjunction with the MRN data management system <ref type="bibr">(Bockholt et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2011)</ref>, a centralized institutional level system managing multiple federated studies simultaneously. It has also been applied within an <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-71">OpenClinica</rs> <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-71" resp="#curator" type="version">1</rs> data management system <ref type="bibr">(Bockholt et al., in preparation)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Linking to other databases. To ensure database platform and schema independence, this step is performed by a SOAP web service that is individually customized by a software engineer associated with the required database platform. This web service need be written only once per database schema and then applied to all studies that are stored using the same database schema. Modification for communication with FBIRN Human Imaging Database (FBIRN HID) 2 led to the addition of the ability to export assessments in different XML formats. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-11">CARAT</rs> can export the subject's data using the XML-based Clinical Experiment Data Exchange (XCEDE) schema, which the FBIRN HID uses to import data 3 .</p>
            <p>Real-time data validation. The validation steps can be set per question per assessment, and can be changed for different visits within a study if needed. They include checking required fields for completion, data type (e.g., numeric, character string, or date), bounds-checking (e.g., systolic blood pressure is a number between 0 and 300), and question dependencies (e.g., Question 2 "How many cigarets do you smoke a day?" does not need to be answered if the answer to Question 1 "Do you smoke?" is NO). <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-12">CARAT</rs> provides some complex controls like tree selects, and repeating groups of fields, as one might use for a medication or drug history. During an interview, the rater is notified immediately when a required field is skipped or data entered does not meet quality criteria, but the software does not require the rater to fix the data immediately. This allows the rater to complete the interview smoothly and fix data issues at a later time if necessary. CRFs that do not pass data quality validation may be stored on the rater's tablet and edited at any time, but they may not be submitted to the database until all issues are resolved. Examples are shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 4 and 6</ref>.</p>
            <p>In <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-13">CARAT</rs>, XML layout specifications for CRFs are created using a graphic tool that uses the SOAP web service to pull the question metadata from the study protocols already in the database. The layout tool is designed for raters or other study staff to use to create detailed layouts, including GUI elements and data validation, with a minimum of technical expertise. Questions may be dragged and dropped into a GUI form and then modified as necessary. If metadata about a particular CRF question does not exist in a database, the metadata can be provided directly in the layout(4) Conditional skipping of questions: Here, since the participant answered "Yes" about English being their primary language, the follow-up question is not required. (5) Required fields are marked with a red icon.</p>
            <p>The layout is then exported as an XML CRF specification to be included in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-14">CARAT</rs>.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-15">CARAT</rs> software has spent the last almost 3 years in longterm piloting with multiple studies. During this time, it has been through three rounds of enhancement in response to user feedback. User needs led to extensive expansion of the options for assessment appearance, keyboard shortcuts for studies that made more use of the keyboard, expansion of user preferences so that default behavior better matches specific study needs, allowing sorting and re-ordering of assessments on the fly, creating missing data explanation fields, turning pen use on and off as needed, and various other usability changes.</p>
            <p>Navigation of lengthy CRFs on paper is often not linear; clinicians may skip back and forth as the flow of the interview require. To recreate this in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-16">CARAT</rs>, users may navigate through the CRF pages using the arrow buttons in the lower right-hand corner, or they may go to a specific page using the navigation tree.</p>
            <p>When Complete or Review buttons at the top of the form are clicked, the prototype validates all questions in the CRF and displays a list of errors for the user to address, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Clicking or tapping the error listing takes the user to the question that needs to be addressed. CRFs may be edited and saved with known errors, but they may not be submitted to the database until all errors are addressed. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-17">CARAT</rs> interface includes the ability to create an exception, explaining how the data were not able to be collected, if this is the case. This method ensures that an error does not obstruct an interview, but that all issues are addressed before the data appears in the database.</p>
            <p>This prototype has been in long-term pilot with multiple groups, of which we will describe two examples: Psychopathy Research under Dr. Kent Kiehl located at the MRN and FBIRN <ref type="bibr">(Keator et al., 2008; Potkin et al., 2009)</ref>, a collaboration featuring more than 10 distributed sites. These groups use different database schemas and have different data collection needs. These projects have been instrumental in gathering user feedback as well as demonstrating the usefulness of the software in real assessment gathering conditions. We have recently added a self-assessment mode to allow the same <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-18">CARAT</rs> system to be used in computer labs for self-assessments.</p>
            <p>With the exception of the upload of completed CRFs to a database, all major functions on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-19">CARAT</rs> are available without internet or network access. Asynchronous updates, however, can lead to duplicate or existing data in the centralized data management system, which must not be overwritten. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-20">REDCap</rs> has developed an elegant system to manage these issues <ref type="bibr">(Borlawsky et al., 2011)</ref>;<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-21">CARAT</rs> handles those problems to some extent, though not as completely. At this point, the MICIS and BIRN web services will check against the subject ID, assessment, study, and visit to see if duplicate data already exists in the database. We are working to make the generic web service more flexible and secure for these issues while maintaining its agnostic approach to database schema Clinical assessment and remote administration tablet was designed and implemented on a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-22">Windows</rs> system. Convertible tablets, for which <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-23">Windows</rs> was the dominant operating system, are being overwhelmed by the new popularity of slate tablets. Slates tend to run <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-24">Android</rs> or <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-25">iOS</rs>, as well as <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-26">Windows</rs>; <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-27">CARAT</rs> is being re-factored to be platform-independent, to take advantage of these new options.</p>
            <p>A challenge specific to multi-site studies is the need to have all users have the same implementation of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-28">CARAT</rs>, the same forms and layouts. For studies which decide on their protocol and never vary from it, it is not a challenge to set up one instantiation of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-29">CARAT</rs> and disseminate it to all the participating sites. Many clinical and research studies, however, find that they need new or revised CRFs over the course of a study; confirming all sites are using the same version has been a challenge for <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-30">CARAT</rs> in multi-site studies. Future versions of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-31">CARAT</rs> will implement automatic update detection, so that all sites are running with the latest version for a given study whenever they have internet access.</p>
            <p>Electronic data capture of the assessments and interviews associated with clinical neuroimaging studies have been used in many studies, and the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-32">CARAT</rs> system which we present has been tested in a wide range of study situations. The needs which EDC systems commonly address include using a web interface to transmit data directly into a database, usually over the internet so that only a browser is needed for the user. The ability to handle complex forms, multiple types of questions, conditional branching, and constraint checking is also needed for an adequate system <ref type="bibr">(Harris et al., 2009)</ref>. Unique needs for many research programs include the ability to use a tablet system rather than a desktop or laptop, and to work where the internet is not available, without giving up the ability to capture the data and transmit it directly to a study database. The demands of neuroimaging studies includes the ability to identify the subject's imaging data with their clinical and other data, preferably within a centralized multi-modal data repository.</p>
            <p>The first advantage of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-33">CARAT</rs> is that it was designed to work on a tablet, mimicking natural interviewing style. The use of the stylus on the tablet screen has been popular with researchers who prefer the pen and paper approach. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-34">CARAT</rs> also includes the ability to handle constraint checking and complex conditional branching, similar to what <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-35">REDCap</rs> provides. Data validation supports regular expressions, so error detection can become extremely detailed. Responses can be validated not just by data type (date, number, character string, etc.) but by complex ranges of these in almost any combination. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-36">CARAT</rs> at the moment does not implement the ability to reference multiple questions in a single validation rule, however; it can require the response field be filled in according to highly complex string-formation rules combining letters and numbers, but we can't say that the response must be less the answer to the previous question plus 100, for example. That has not been a common request from users, though it could be implemented if needed.</p>
            <p>An appropriate EDC solution must also provide a high degree of CRF customization to accommodate the almost constant stream of new assessments, and modifications to existing assessments, which comes with many research programs. The CRFs and other assessment forms must be extremely customizable, allowing for entry of common, rare, and unique study-specific assessments. It should be modifiable by the research team that is collecting and/or managing the data, rather than depending on the original software developers -ease of use in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-37">CARAT</rs> layout system is currently a focus of ongoing development. Ideally, for non-copyright material, a repository of assessments should be available, built from studies already using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-38">CARAT</rs>, so that the forms for a new study can be set up quickly and re-use existing forms automatically whenever possible, similar to the system implemented in <ref type="bibr">(El Fadly et al., 2011)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Data-gathering software appropriate to the specific needs of clinical research interviews is unlikely to be widely adopted if it cannot conform to the data storage solutions already employed at mature research sites. It may or may not be possible to integrate data from independent software packages that employ their own distinct database schemas. The software must be able to plug into the existing frameworks already in use by mature research programs. It must have a mechanism to communicate with existing databases and schemas, be they off-the-shelf like <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-39">OpenClinica</rs> or custom solutions such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-40">REDCap</rs>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-41">CARAT</rs> has the flexibility Frontiers in Neuroinformatics www.frontiersin.org to interact with arbitrary databases, rather than a single proprietary database specialized for clinical assessments, thus allowing the ability of combining clinical and imaging data within a single repository. <ref type="bibr">Franklin et al. (2011)</ref> reviewed several common EDC systems within their needs for small-scale clinical trials; their list of valued features overlapped with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-42">CARAT</rs> specifications to some extent. Their list included availability of training materials, the presence of site and user roles and permissions, ease of designing CRFs including error detection, the ability to create a visit schedule for data-entry, and the ease in importing or exporting data in a standards-compliant way. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-43">CARAT</rs> provides training materials for the user interface, and the developers' manual for the web interface is in development. The fact that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-44">CARAT</rs> is built to work with both MICIS and HID and to be expandable to other database system means many of the security issues and permissions are considered the purview of the database, however, rather than the data collection system. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-45">CARAT</rs> can validate that the rater's username and password is a valid rater for the study, and that the subject ID being used is for a subject who is enrolled in the study. Other levels of permission that are not related to collecting assessment data are not within the scope of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-46">CARAT</rs> at this time.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-47">CARAT</rs> software is available from www.nitric.org, under multiple licenses.

            <p>Examination of cell viability. Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay (cat. no. M2128; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a concentration of 5x10 4 and allowed to adhere. Following treatment for different time intervals, 100 µl MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added into the cells and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 37˚C. Subsequently, the supernatant was removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (cat. no. D2650; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to dissolve the resultant formazan crystals. The absorbance was read at 570 nm (EL309 Automated Microplate Reader; Bio-Tek Instruments, lnc., Winooski, VT, USA). Six wells were measured for each group and the experiment was repeated three times.Statistical analysis. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="e1ad12a16f-software-0">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#e1ad12a16f-software-0" resp="#annotator8" type="version">13.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#e1ad12a16f-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS, Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for data analysis.

            <p>The ta-siRNA, a newly identified class of 21-nt short siRNAs, play an essential role in bridging the miRNA and siRNA pathways, which were previously believed to be two independent processes <ref type="bibr">(2-5)</ref>. Phase-initiators direct the cleavage of ta-siRNA gene (TAS) primary transcripts (precursors) and subsequently initiate the production of ta-siRNA clusters <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. To date, only a few known phase-initiators are ta-siRNAs as most of reported phaseinitiators are miRNAs. Following cleavage of the precursor, the 3 0 (or 5 0 )-cleavage products are converted into double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by RDR6 and SGS3. The dsRNA is then processed into 21-nt increments, relative to the original cleavage site on both strands, by DCL4 in order to produce ta-siRNA clusters <ref type="bibr">(3,4)</ref>. The ta-siRNAs form an essential component of the RISC complex responsible for guiding AGO-dependent cleavage of the target transcript. Based on these data, several researchers have proposed a 'miRNA ! ta-siRNA ! target gene' cleavage cascade as an element of gene regulatory network in the model plant Arabidopsis (4-7). In this paper, we describe the development of the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-0">pssRNAMiner</rs>, a plant short small RNA regulatory cascade analysis server that is able to identify potential ta-siRNAs clusters and their phase-initiators.</p>
            <p>In this study, we describe the development of<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-1">pssRNAMiner</rs>, a web-based server which identifies ta-siRNA clusters as well as their potential phaseinitiators. This program requires that the user submit a set of small RNAs and specify one of listed transcript/ genomic libraries for mapping. To identify phaseinitiators, the user must submit at least one small RNA as candidate phase initiator. The <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-2">pssRNAMiner</rs> is able to identify phased small RNA clusters as ta-siRNA candidates by evaluating the P-values of hypergeometric distribution. Furthermore, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-3">pssRNAMiner</rs> has the ability to identify potential phase-initiators based on the user input. To date, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-4">pssRNAMiner</rs> hosts 29 transcript/ genomic sequence libraries from 20 species.</p>
            <p>To perform this analysis, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-5">pssRNAMiner</rs> first searches the complementary regions between the phase-initiator and TAS candidate precursor using the Smith-Waterman algorithm <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. It then ranks the alignment of complementary regions based on a scoring scheme described by Zhang <ref type="bibr">(11,12)</ref>. Since the Smith-Waterman algorithm is only able to identify the optimal alignment for each pair of query/target sequences, an iterative algorithm has been developed to obtain as many complementary regions as possible. During each iteration, the identified complementary region of the precursor sequences are masked by 'N' letters for the next iterative search until no further complementary region(s) can be identified in a given query/target sequence.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-6">pssRNAMiner</rs> consists of two independent components, a backend pipeline that is responsible for directing the core functions and a web server. The core functions, which include the calculation of the P-value and analysis of cleavage sites directed by the phase-initiator, are performed by the backend pipeline written in Java and PERL. To perform a search for complementary regions, a third party software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-7">ssearch</rs> has been used for SmithWaterman alignment. The web server was developed on top of a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-8">SQLite</rs> database. Scripts used to generate web interfaces and search results were written in PHP.</p>
            <p>Based on user preferences, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-9">pssRNAMiner</rs> can also identify potential cleavage site guided by phase-initiator on TAS candidate precursor. For <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-10">pssRNAMiner</rs> to perform this function, it is necessary for the user to submit potential phase-initiators in multi-FASTA format and specify the maximum expectation for screening the complementary region between the phase-initiators and TAS candidate precursors. In addition, it is necessary for the user to specify the expected cleavage range in the complementary region (generally between 9 and 11 nt on miRNA sequence) <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b)</ref>. After submission, the server aligns input phase-initiators with TAS candidate precursors to locate complementary regions. Next, the server searches valid cleavage sites from the complementary regions based on the distance between the cleavage site and the phased small RNA clusters and output a web page that lists clusters with cleavage site information <ref type="figure">(Figure 2a-c)</ref>.</p>
            <p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-11">pssRNAMiner</rs> and to facilitate its use, we have integrated a number of published small RNA datasets into <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-12">pssRNAMiner</rs>. These data can be found under the 'dataset' sub-menu. Each dataset has been pre-run against their corresponding transcript/genomic sequences, and therefore users may click links on the right-hand column of dataset table to view these precalculated results.</p>
            <p>Finally, to evaluate the performance of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-13">pssRNAMiner</rs>, we downloaded RDR small RNA MPSS libraries from theArabidopsis MPSS Plus database (http://mpss.udel.edu/ at/) <ref type="bibr">(13,14)</ref>. A total of 11 767 distinct small RNA signatures were analyzed based on the Arabidopsis TAIR7 cDNA release (ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/ TAIR7_genome_release/). When these data were investigated, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-14">pssRNAMiner</rs> detected 124 significantly phased small RNA clusters (P &lt; 0.005) at 19 gene loci. Moreover, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-15">pssRNAMiner</rs> detected all the reported ta-siRNA gene loci with significant P-value, including TAS1a (AT2G27400), TAS1b (AT1G50055), TAS1c (AT2G39675), TAS2 (AT2G39681), TAS3a (AT3G17185) and PPR proteins (AT1G63080 and AT1G63130) (see Supplementary Material for the list of detected phased RNA clusters and gene loci). To investigate the ability of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-16">pssRNAMiner</rs> to identify valid cleavage site of phase-initiators, a reported phase-initiator, miRNA 'ath-miR390', was submitted for cleavage site analysis on TAS candidate precursors. The <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a387630812-software-simple-17">pssRNAMiner</rs> reported two complementary regions (expectation 5) with one region having a valid cleavage site on TAS3a. These results are consistent with previously published studies that demonstrated that the ath-miR390 initiates production of phased small RNA clusters on TAS3a by guiding precursor cleavage (2,4) (see detailed alignment in the Supplementary Material).</p>

Using this ortholog database, we calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient for domain-domain interactions between S4D and PDZ domains found in human proteins using the Mirrortree methodology as described previously <ref type="bibr">[26,28,29]</ref>. Briefly, the full protein multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were broken at the domain start and end positions. These reduced domain MSAs were used as the input for the Mirrortree method, along with the PDZ domains found in all other human proteins.</p>

            <p>To convert the NMR data into a form that can be useable in statistical procedures firstly the FIDsalready have been fourier transformed to the frequency domain-manually phased and baselinecorrected applying <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f43ee9c12e-software-simple-0">XWINNMR</rs> or other <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref>. Then the NMR data are usually transformed into a matrix in which a sample and a metabolic signal pertain to a row and a column, respectively. The spectral intensity at a particular chemical shift corresponds to the estimated level of a particular metabolite. The Carr-PucellMeiboom-Gill (CPMG) spin-echo pulse sequence, π/2-t D -π-t D , was used for serum samples <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. CPMG experiment can enhances visualization of the low molecular weight metabolites and to suppress the broad signal from the protein <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. Spectral regions within the range of 0.2 to 10 ppm were used after deleting the region containing residual water and urea signals (4.5 to 6.0 ppm) <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. Biological fluids such as serum, plasma and urine have been used for studies of crohn's disease. Serum and plasma are the most common fluids in metabonomics surveys. These samples are also relatively easy to obtain.</p>
            <p>In some researches, for each samples 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS) was added as internal reference substance (δ=0 ppm).

            <p>Segmentation of regions. The automated procedures for obtaining volumetric measurements of the different brain structures were described by Fischl et al. <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. This procedure was accomplished using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="d0573c3b43-software-0">Freesurfer</rs> package version <rs corresp="#d0573c3b43-software-0" resp="#annotator14" type="version">4.5</rs> (<rs corresp="#d0573c3b43-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging</rs>, Charlestown, Massachusetts, USA). This software classifies each voxel with a neuroanatomical label based on probabilistic information automatically estimated from a manually labeled training set. Initially, an optimal linear transform was computed to maximize the likelihood of the input image based on an atlas constructed from manually labeled images. Next, a nonlinear transform was initialized with the transformation of the previous step, and the image was deformed until a better match of the atlas was obtained. Finally, a Bayesian segmentation procedure was applied, and the maximum a posteriori estimate of the labeling was computed. The technique has been previously shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual labeling (17). The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="d0573c3b43-software-simple-3">Freesurfer</rs> system provides the volumes of the classified structures and cortical thickness values.</p>
            <p>where (MO) is the signal intensity of the pixel with no MT pulse, Ms is the signal intensity of the pixel with the MT pulse, and MTR is the magnetization transfer ratio. We used the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="d0573c3b43-software-simple-4">Mincmath</rs> tool <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref> to construct the MTR map for each exam.</p>
            <p>where Sr r,TE ð Þand S 0r r ð Þ represent the pixel intensity at the positionr r in the image obtained at the TE echo time and ''ideal'' 0 echo time, respectively. Therefore, a linear least squares method can be used to estimate the T2 pixel value (T2r r ð Þ) from the obtained TE images. The in-house script "Relaxon" was implemented for this purpose using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="d0573c3b43-software-simple-5">MINC</rs> tools.</p>
            <p>where LRXWM is the white matter relaxometry of the left hemisphere and RRXWM is the white matter relaxometry of the right hemisphere. The patients, based on their MRI characteristics, were divided using k-means cluster analyses implemented in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="d0573c3b43-software-simple-6">Minitab</rs> software, and two groups were formed: cluster 1, which had the best results with respect to quantitative MRI measures (high volumes and MTRs), and cluster 2, which had the worst results (low volumes and MTR values and high T2 values). The k-means cluster analysis is used to cluster observations into groups when the groups are initially unknown. This procedure uses non-hierarchical clustering of observations.</p>
            <p>These neuropsychological results were divided according to the quantitative MRI measures, and a comparison between the groups was performed by the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="d0573c3b43-software-6">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#d0573c3b43-software-6" resp="#annotator14" type="version">13.0</rs> for Windows including the variables age and schooling.</p>

            <p>It is necessary to establish collaborations between human and veterinary medicine, food authorities, and environmental sectors, and these different sectors should collect data from both humans and animals. These data include the emerging and reemerging zoonotic pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and parasites) and the prevalence, variation, genomic data, and the life cycle of the natural reservoir, as well as antibiotic use and antibiotic sensitivity. Moreover, a database is needed and should be available to scientists from different fields.

            <p>Depending on vessel type/cellular context, distinct cellular mechanisms are used alternatively or in combination during vascular lumen scope. Confocal images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 oil objective. Time-lapse series of HUVECs expressing the singlechain Raichu/Cdc42 FRET probe <ref type="bibr">(Aoki and Matsuda, 2009)</ref> were collected every 1 min for 30-60 min on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope equipped with Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.4 oil objective. Images were collected every minute for a total of 30-60 min. For ultrastructural analysis, collagen gels were prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Briefly, gels were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 75 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 3 h at 4°C, followed by overnight wash in 114 mM PBS. Gels were subsequently postfixed in 1% OsO 4 reduced with 1% K 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] in 1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4°C, washed twice in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut, mounted onto copper grids, and viewed with a Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope (FEI). Digital images were acquired with a MegaViewIII camera controlled with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="ab40fb9efb-software-0">iTEM</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ab40fb9efb-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Olympus Soft Imaging Systems</rs>, Germany) and then postprocessed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="ab40fb9efb-software-1">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#ab40fb9efb-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, MD) and <rs corresp="#ab40fb9efb-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Adobe</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ab40fb9efb-software-2">Illustrator</rs>.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="ab40fb9efb-software-simple-6">Fiji</rs> was used for image processing and extraction of quantitative data. For quantitative analysis of VE-cadherin, PDXL, active Cdc42, and p-aPKC, the average fluorescence intensity in regions of interest (ROIs) located in the luminal area was measured using<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="ab40fb9efb-software-simple-7">ImageJ</rs> software. A total of 35-50 ROIs from 3D images pooled from three independent experiments was analyzed. To determine VE-cadherin junctional length and the percentage of luminal perimeter coated with PDXL, the line scan function of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="ab40fb9efb-software-simple-8">ImageJ</rs> was used on 25-30 junctions/lumens from three independent experiments. Images from FRET time-lapse series were processed with <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="ab40fb9efb-software-simple-9">Fiji</rs>. Briefly, a binary mask was derived from the YFP image and was multiplied separately with the TFP and FRET images. Then FRET images were divided by TFP images to obtain FRET/TFP ratio images. A rainbow color LUT was applied, and brightness and contrast were adjusted to display the ratio FRET images in an intensity-modulated manner by which red indicates high and blue indicates low FRET efficiency, respectively. For quantitative analysis, YFP-masked FRET and TFP images were thresholded to measure pixel intensity of each individual image in the stack, and FRET/TFP intensity ratios were calculated as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Chaki et al., 2013)</ref>. For statistical purposes, time-lapse series were acquired from four to six cells/group. Experiments were repeated three times.</p>

Survival analyses were performed to compare clinical performance of fresh and FFPE tissues. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to compare the survival distributions of MammaPrint for fresh and FFPE for distant metastasis as first event (DMF) and distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI). DMF was defined as the time from surgery until the diagnosis of a distant metastasis as first event. For DMF, patients who present with a local recurrence, regional recurrence, or second primary tumor before the diagnosis of a distant metastasis were censored at such event, at death or at the end of follow-up. DRFI was defined as the time from surgery until the diagnosis of a first distant metastasis or breast cancer-related death.</p>

            <p>Crystal diffraction data of apo-ACP and FabZ-ACP complex were collected at beamline BL19U1 at the National Center for Protein Sciences Shanghai and Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, China. Significant decay of the complex crystals during data collection caused the resolution cut off at 2.55 Å.

The GOLDScore fitness function was employed in scoring conformations. The parameters for GOLD were as follows: numbers of GA ran 50, no early termination was allowed and all other parameters were used as default (Supplementary information, <ref type="table">Table S3)</ref>.</p>
            <p>FabZ-ACP complex purified from gel-filtration in the solution containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM DTT was used in the Synchrotron SAXS experiment. The measurement was performed in a vacuum cuvette with exposure time of 1 s to diminish the parasitic scattering under wavelength 1.03 Å at National Center for Protein Sciences Shanghai (NCPSS) beamline BL19U2, China. The scattering was recorded in the range of the momentum transfer 0.015 &lt; s &lt; 0.420/Å, where s = (4π × sinθ)/λ and 2θ is the scattering angle.

            <p>MST assay is a new immobilization-free and titration-based technology for biomolecule interaction determination <ref type="bibr">[58]</ref>. The assay was performed with a NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH). Briefly, FabZ or FabZ (Y100A) was labeled with fluorescence dye NT-647 (amine-reaction) according to manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, 50 nM of labeled protein was mixed with various concentrations of holo-ACP in the reaction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM fresh DTT and 0.05% Tween 20. After incubation for 5 min under room temperature, 10 µl of the mixtures were loaded into premium coated capillaries for measurement. The MST data were then collected under 40% infrared laser power and 20% light-emitting diode power. Nanotemper analysis software (1.5.41) was used to fit the independent experimental data and determine Kd and standard deviation value. The figure was generated by using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a675de2da1-software-29">GraphPad Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#a675de2da1-software-29" resp="#annotator3" type="version">5</rs>.</p>

            <p>Western blots were performed to analyze the levels of the receptors known to be involved in LTD induction. The DLS and NAc were visually identified in brain slices and were dissected with the help of a scalpel blade and tweezers. The tissue was frozen and stored at −20°C until processed. The samples were sonicated in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and boiled for 10 minutes. Protein concentration was determined in each sample with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (BCA-kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were resuspended in sample buffer and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 10% running gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) transfer membrane (Sigma-Aldrich). The membranes were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with 5% (wt/vol) dry milk in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS)-Tween20. Immunoblotting was carried out with antibodies against CB1 (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:500 dilution), mGluR1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, 1:500), mGluR5 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Waltham, MA, 1:500), GluN1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 1:500), and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:4000) in 5% dry milk dissolved in TBS-Tween 20. The membranes were washed 3 times with TBS-Tween20 and incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (H+L) (Thermo Scientific; Göteborg, Sweden, 1:6000 dilution) for 1 hour at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, the membranes were washed 6 times with TBS-Tween 20 and immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).

            <p>According to the orientation of the implanted neck, the cases were divided into 10 groups <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).

            <p>All patients underwent CT scans prior to the administration of imatinib and 4 10 weeks after the initiation of the imatinib therapy. Ten patients underwent two or more follow-up CT scans 4 22 months after the initiation of the treatment with imatinib. The CT scan data were available on a picture archiving and communications system (PACS; Marotech, Seoul, Korea) for all patients. The CT scans were performed using a Somatom Plus-4 (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany), a HiSpeed Advantage scanner (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), or a MX8000 four-detector row CT scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH). Each patient receivedC 120 mL of a nonionic contrast material (Iopromide, Ultravist 370; Schering Korea, Seoul, Korea) through an 18-gauge angiographic catheter inserted into a forearm vein. The contrast material was injected at a rate of 2.5 mL/sec using an automatic injector. In the case of the single-detector scanner, a helical CT scan was performed with the following parameters: 5 7 mm collimation, 1:1 table pitch, and 5 7 mm reconstruction intervals. In the case of the MX8000 scanner, the parameters were 2.5 mm detector collimation, 20 mm/sec table speed, 5 mm slice thickness, and a 5 mm reconstruction interval. The delay between the contrast material administration and scanning was 55 70 seconds. Two radiologists reviewed all of the CT scans retrospectively, and the final interpretations were reached by consensus. All images were reviewed on a 2,000 2,000 PACS monitor. The presence of the metastatic lesion and its size before and after the imatinib treatment were compared. The metastatic lesions were assessed according to their location, size (greatest diameter), attenuation, and enhancing pattern. If multiple metastatic lesions were detected, the largest lesion was recorded. For the objective analysis, the CT attenuation value was measured in a circular region of interest with a diameter of 10 mm. The CT attenuation value was measured three times by a single radiologist and the mean value was recorded. In the case of a heterogeneous mass, the CT attenuation value was measured in the solid portion of the tumor. The CT attenuation value before and after the imatinib treatment was compared using the paired t-test. Statistical analyses were performed using a computer software package (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ed22fe84dc-software-0">SPSS</rs>, version <rs corresp="#ed22fe84dc-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">10.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#ed22fe84dc-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS</rs>, Chicago, Ill). A p value of less than .05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.</p>

            <p>We propose that epigenetic changes, specifically hypermethylation of one BRCA1 allele constituted the first hit leading to inactivation of an important tumor suppressor gene and tumor initiation. Germline mutations in BRCA1 are associated with hereditary breast cancer, ovarian cancer and some other malignancies; however, so far they are generally not considered as a risk factor for childhood cancer. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> Our index patient developed precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 4 y and 8 mo. There are only few data linking BRCA1 to hematologic malignancies. In chronic myeloid leukemia, expression of the BCR-ABL fusion protein leads to posttranscriptional downregulation of BRCA1. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> One study reported partial hypermethylation and reduced expression of BRCA1 in primary and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, <ref type="bibr">30</ref> whereas others did not find abnormal BRCA1 methylation in leukemia samples. <ref type="bibr">7,31</ref> In the MZ twin pair studied here, only one sister exhibited a BRCA1 epimutation in a mosaic state in multiple tissues/ cell types, whereas the unaffected twin did not. This epimutation most likely originated by a methylation error during early embryogenesis after the twinning event. It affects a substantial subset of cells derived from different embryonic cell lineages, resulting in somatic mosaicism. Genome-wide demethylation waves in the early embryo erase most germline methylation patterns, followed by de novo methylation and establishment of somatic methylation patterns. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> Most constitutive epimutations may occur during this vulnerable time window, where epigenetic genome reprogramming occurs, and represent stochastic and/or environmentally induced errors in the establishment or maintenance of an epigenetic state. <ref type="bibr">33</ref>For classic bisulfite plasmid sequencing BRCA1 PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector using T4-DNA ligase, the TA cloning kit and One Shot TOP10 chemically competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA of individual clones was isolated with the ZR Plasmid Miniprep Classic Kit (Zymo Research, Freiburg, Germany). Insert-containing clones were sequenced using dye terminator cycle sequencing with M13 primers on an ABI 3130xl automated sequencer. Sequences were analyzed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="f90d27947b-software-simple-0">BiQ Analyzer</rs> software tool. <ref type="bibr">46</ref> Protein expression analyses. Cells were resuspended two times in 500 μl of 10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, pH 7.9 and incubated on ice for 10 min. After 10 sec centrifugation at maximum speed the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mM HEPES, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, pH 7.9 and homogenized. After incubation on ice for 30 min and centrifugation for 30 min at maximum speed at 4°C, the supernatant containing the nuclear protein extract was separated from ATM-dependent mechanism and, on the other hand, essential for the recruitment of previously activated ATM to the sites of DNA damage. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> Although we cannot exclude the formal possibility of a chance coincidence or a late (i.e., therapy-related) somatic event, it is plausible to assume that epigenetic silencing of one copy of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene in 25% body cells and differences in the DNA damage response contributed to the discordant cancer phenotype in the affected twin. Preliminary evidence suggests that BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation can also be found in blood cells of a subset of breast cancer patients. <ref type="bibr">43,44</ref> Collectively, these results suggest that constitutive BRCA1 epimutations occur in normal tissues and may be associated with an increased cancer risk. Our pyrosequencing assay may prove useful for high-throughput screening of larger patient populations.</p>

            <p>Objectives: Extraarticular Reconstructions (ERs), isolated or in association with Intraarticular ACL Reconstructions (IRs) were popular in the eighties. However they were almost completely given up as a result of a consensus conference organized by <ref type="bibr">AOSSM in 1989 in Snowmass (Co)</ref> where the experts concluded that ERs, even if biomechanically justified, were unable to provide any improvement in clinical results with greater morbidity, higher risk of complications and increased rate of degenerative osteoarthritis (DOA). However, as since then the surgical techniques and postoperative rehabilitation have radically changed, it could be helpful to reconsider ERs and their long term effect on knee stability and on DOA. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients who underwent an anatomic single bundle ACL reconstruction with hamstrings were re-evaluated at a minimum follow up of eleven years. In 23 cases (group B), due to the presence of a Pivot Shift test graded as +++ or in cases of athletes involved in high risk sports, a lateral tenodesis (Coker/Arnold) was associated. The other 77 patients, where an isolated IR was performed with the same technique (group A), served as control. All patients followed the same, standard postoperative rehabilitation program. At follow up Lysholm, IKDC and Tegner activity scores were used. A side to side maximum manual (S/S MM) KT1000 measurement was done. Comparative weight bearing antero-posterior and lateral radiograms were performed and analyzed according to Fairbank, Kellgren and IKDC classification. Tibio-femoral and patella-femoral joints were analyzed separately. Statistical analysis was performed using Student t-test, Pearson chi-square test with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="f3f19a3fe7-software-0">SPPS</rs> <rs corresp="#f3f19a3fe7-software-0" resp="#annotator4" type="version">9.0</rs> software. Results: Group A and B were homogeneous for sex and age. At final follow up seven patients were lost. Subjectively Lysholm score, IKDC and Tegner Activity score improved significantly in both groups with no significant difference. Objectively the number of patient categorized as A and B according to the IKDC was significantly higher in group B than in group A ( P=0.05). Considering as a failure a S/S M/M difference &gt; 5mm or a Pivot Shift test graded as ++ or +++ or a recurrence of any giving way episode, we found 7 cases in group A and no cases in group B (P=0.006). Radiogical evaluation showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in all scales in both femoro-tibial and patello-femoral joints.</p>

            <p>More causative gene identifications lie ahead of us With the introduction of higher resolution arrays in routine diagnostics, we can expect an increasing number of very local chromosomal rearrangements to be identified. These small copy number variants detected in patients are submitted to databases, such as DECIPHER, ECARUCA and ISCA, along with phenotypic information <ref type="bibr">[38-44]</ref>. A closer look at the data submitted, for instance to DECIPHER, suggests that many more causative gene identifications may lie ahead of us. In this database, currently containing publicly available data from 6,000 patients, about 80 de novo single gene aberrations are present, consisting of 55 deletions and 25 duplications. Using the <rs cert="0.4" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d09d366404-software-simple-0">DAVID</rs> annotation tools <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>, we found that 55% of these genes are expressed in the brain and 15% are involved in the functioning of the glutamate or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors (unpublished observations). Furthermore, genes involved in neurogenesis, differentiation and coding for developmental proteins are enriched in this set. These data clearly suggest a role for at least some of these small copy number variants in neurological disease.</p>

The quintile values of serum bilirubin in the 1, 208 subjects were 0.6 mg/dL, 0.8 mg/dL, 1.0 mg/dL, and 1.1 mg/dL and we grouped the subjects according to the highest quintile value of serum bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL. Differences in proportions among the subject groups were compared by the Pearson's chi-square test. Group differences for continuous variables were assessed by the Student t-test. We defined the event period as the duration from the date of the first health check-up to the date when subjects had become hypertensive during follow-up health check-up (s). We compared the cumulative incidence of hypertension between the bilirubin groups by Log-rank test. To determine whether the bilirubin category was associated independently with the incidence of hypertension, we used Cox's proportional hazard model adjusted for serum albumin and univariate risk factors for the development of hypertension. We checked the violation of the proportional hazard assumption by partial residual plot against time for each covariate and log minus log plots (LML) for categorical covariates, such as bilirubin group. The average values of residuals for covariates includ-Selected 1,208 subjects, aged more than 18 yr, who did not take anti-hypertensive medicine, SBP less than 120 mmHg, and DBP less than 80 mmHg at the fist examinationed in Cox's model were zero and the LML for each categorical variable was parallel. Two-sided p values are reported, with 0.05 taken as the level of statistical significance. All data are shown as mean±standard deviation or frequency per observation.</p>

            <p>For the total protein extract preparation, tissue samples or cell pellets were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (H-buffer) containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM dithiothreitol, leupeptin at 200 mg/ml, Aprotinin at 10 mg/ml, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (all from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Zappelli et al., 1996)</ref>. The obtained homogenate was disrupted by sonication, incubated for 30 min on ice with repeated vortexing, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. For the preparation of subcellular protein fractions, the cell pellet was homogenized in H-buffer lacking Triton X-100, and incubated 30 min on ice. Samples were then spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was saved as cytosolic fraction, and the remaining pellet was suspended in H-buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated for 30 min on ice. At the end, the samples were spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the remaining supernatant was saved as the particulate fraction. An equal amount of protein from each sample was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Roche Applied Science) or ALP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) were used as secondary antibodies, and immunoreactive bands were detected using CDP-STAR solution (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Next, 400 μl ×1 Annexin binding buffer was added to each cell sample, and the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Influx, Becton Dickinson) using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a4845ff716-software-2">Cell Quest Research</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#a4845ff716-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Becton Dickinson</rs>).</p>
            <p>We used χ 2 and Fisher's exact tests to determine correlations between PDCD5 levels and clinical parameters. The cumulative survival time was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between groups in univariate and multivariate settings. A P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.

            <p>Rank sum and F tests were used for the comparison of ps-Tg and ps-Tg/TSH values. The Kruskal-Wallis and F tests were used for comparisons among the three groups; the Mann-Whitney U and F tests were used to compare any two groups. The most sensitive and specific ps-Tg values for distinguishing each of the two group comparisons were obtained using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Gender (female or male), age (&lt;45 years or ≥45 years), tumor size (maximum diameter ≤1 cm or &gt;1 cm), multifocality (single lesion or multiple lesions) and ps-Tg level (&lt;corresponding cut-off value or ≥corresponding cut-off value) were involved as independent variables of recurrence and distant metastasis. These factors were further analyzed using logistic regression analysis to identify if ps-Tg was an independent predictive factor for discerning different recurrence risk groups, and if distant metastases existed.

Biomarker levels were entered as continuous variables to avoid the loss of potentially valuable diagnostic information at levels below and above dichotomous cut-offs. Hs-cTnT levels below the limit of blank for the assay (&lt;3 ng/L) were entered as 2 ng/L. We then used the predicted probability of developing the primary outcome (according to the final model) to categorise patients into four risk groups, which were defined a priori according to the disposition decisions available to emergency physicians for this patient group: (1) Very low risk (suitable for discharge); (2) Low risk (suitable for a low dependency environment such as an ED observation unit); (3) Moderate risk (general or acute medical ward); and (4) High-risk ( patients who may be considered for immediate referral to a high dependency environment, eg, a coronary care unit). Diagnostic accuracy of the CDR was evaluated in derivation and validation studies by calculation of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV together with 95% CIs (using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d5a20ab388-software-1">MedCalc</rs> V.<rs corresp="#d5a20ab388-software-1" resp="#annotator2" type="version">12.4.0.0</rs>, Mariakerke, Belgium).

The extent of the WMH penumbra was determined by identifying the plateau phase of each dataset by comparing each CBF, FLAIR intensity, and DTI layer to its corresponding mean total brain value within NAWM using a mixed effects model. We created 15 dummy variables indicating each NAWM layer with total brain NAWM as a reference. The difference in coefficients between two adjacent layers were compared to examine the plateau phase. There is a ''location effect'' of white matter association and commissural fibers surrounding the ventricles resulting in high DTI-FA in NAWM surrounding PVWMH compared with the mean NAWM DTI-FA of the entire brain. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Because of this anatomical phenomenon, the plateau phase of this data was determined by comparing adjacent data points using paired t-tests. The first of two neighboring layers whose values were not significantly different from each other was defined as the outer boundary for the PVWMH DTI-FA penumbra. Significant difference was set at p &lt; 0.05. The analysis was performed for PVWMH and DWMHs separately.</p>

            <p>The obtained viral genomic DNA was amplified using a GenomePhi kit (GE Healthcare) and used to make barcoded (10 bp) fragment libraries for 454 sequencing on a Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium (Roche/454 Life Science). The reads were assembled using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="cb3c123bbe-software-15">gsAssembler</rs> (<rs corresp="#cb3c123bbe-software-15" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Roche/454 Life Science</rs>). The coverage of the different genomes was 17Â for HRPV-2, 14Â for HRPV-3, 300Â for HRPV-6 and 300Â for HGPV-1. The obtained assembly was verified with PCR products that for HRPV-2, HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 covered the whole genome. The final genome sequences were obtained by sequencing these PCR products. For HRPV-6, several Sanger sequencing runs confirmed the initial assembly. The primers used for PCR and sequencing are listed in Supplementary Table S2. For the verification of the discontinuous regions, genomic DNA was used in sequencing reactions with primers, which are also listed in Supplementary Table S2. All sequencing reactions were carried out by using BigDye Termination Chemistry v. 3.1 and analysed on an ABI 3130 (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were purified with CleanSeq (Agencourt) using a Beckman NX p robot (Beckman Coulter). Sequences were assembled and edited using GAP4. The sequences were submitted to GenBank and can be found under the accession numbers JN882264 (HRPV-2), JN882265 (HRPV-3), JN882266 (HRPV-6) and JN882267 (HGPV-1).</p>

            <p>The first protein encoded by a conserved cluster of genes is VP3-like protein <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). It is a major structural protein of haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses, predicted to contain several transmembrane regions. VP3-like proteins of the first subgroup of viruses and putative proviruses share extensive identity at the amino acid level ($50% and above, <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S3</ref>). In contrast, VP3-like proteins of the second subgroup show only $20% identity to each other and to homologues of the first subgroup members. The next protein encoded in the conserved cluster of genes is VP4-like major structural protein <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>), forming the spike structure on the virion surface. This protein is processed during maturation. In order to predict the translation start site, the empirically determined N-termini <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>) together with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="cb3c123bbe-software-simple-31">Signal P</rs> and<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="cb3c123bbe-software-simple-32">Tat find</rs> programs were used. Three of the manually annotated VP4-like protein precursors were predicted to have a twin-arginine signal sequence suggesting export of the protein in a folded state. Most of the VP4-like protein precursors share only $20% identity <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table S</ref> <ref type="bibr">8)</ref>. Even though VP4-like polypeptides are much more diverse than VP3-like proteins, the secondary structures are predicted to be similar. All of them are also predicted to contain a coiled-coil region in the C-terminus of the protein just preceding the transmembrane domain that serves as a membrane anchor.</p>

            <p>Phylogenetic analysis of isolates. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from isolate growth cultures oxidizing AH 2 DS with a MoBio Power Soil DNA kit (MoBio Laboratories Inc., Solana Beach, CA) per the manufacturer's protocol. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from gDNA extracts with universal primers 27F (5=-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and 1492R (5=-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT) (F stands for forward and R stands for reverse in the primer names). 16S rRNA gene amplification was performed with Takara Ex Taq HS according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Then, automated <ref type="bibr">1</ref> H shimming was done to obtain the homogeneity of the ROI by using the point resolved spectroscopy sequence pulse sequence. For 31 P spectroscopy, the free induction decay (FID) 2 dimensional (2D) chemical shift imaging (CSI) sequence was carried out in an axial plane. The field of view was 3 x 3 x 3 cm, and the volume was 27 mL. The following parameters were used, Nex: 8, scan number: 128, spectral width: 2500 Hz, and acquired data points: 2048. The 31 P spectra were post-processed using an automated procedure developed in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="ca61476227-software-0">SAGE</rs> (<rs corresp="#ca61476227-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GE Medical Systems</rs>, Fremont, CA, USA). The obtained FID signal was displayed as a spectrum, following 2D CSI reconstruction with a magnitude channel. After using the 6 Hz exponential line broadening, we obtained the MR spectra that were assigned on the basis of prior assignment, such as PME, Pi, PDE, PCr and ATP. The chemical shift in the 31 P MRS referred to the position of PCr (δ = 0.00 ppm). The intracelluar pH of the lesions was calculated by using the chemical shift of Pi relative to PCr, with the formula taken from Ng et al. <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref> <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The integral of each of the phosphorous metabolites, such as ATP, PCr, Pi, PME and PDE, was measured.

            <p>The experiment took place in a quiet temperature-controlled laboratory, and the ambient temperature was kept 26°C. In the experiment, the subjects lay in the supine position on a single bed quietly throughout the experimental procedure. The procedure of the CPT experiment lasted 13 minutes and included 3 phases (showed in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>): the baseline phase (5 minutes), the cold stimulus phase (3 minutes), and the recovery phase (5 minutes). In the cold stimulus phase, the subject immersed his/her left hand to the wrist into a mixture of ice and water (4°C) for 3 minutes. During the entire experimental procedure, cardiovascular signals were collected by Finometer MIDI (Model II, Finapres Medical Systems B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands); and the cardiovascular signals mainly included SBP, DBP, stoke volume, and electrocardiograph (ECG). Then these cardiovascular signals were stored in a personal computer by the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e2ef561860-software-0">BeatScope Easy</rs> software (<rs corresp="#e2ef561860-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Finapres Medical Systems B.V</rs>., Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

TAC assessment There was no "gold standard" to assess the TAC. Chemla et al <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> proposed the ratio of stroke volume to pulse pressure (SV/PP) to measure TAC. The pulse pressure represented the difference between SBP and DBP readings. The SV/PP had been proven reliable to assess the TAC. <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> Therefore, we used SV/PP to estimate TAC in this study.</p>

            <p>High-resolution LC-MS analysis of iTRAQ-labeled peptides was carried out on an Easy nLC 1000 nano-HPLC apparatus (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were suspended in 0.1% formic acid and then loaded onto an PepMap100 C18 LC pre-column (75 µm I.D., 2 cm, Thermo Scientific) and eluted on line onto an analytical NanoViper PepMap™ 100 C18 LC column (75 µm I.D., 50 cm, Thermo Scientific) with a continuous gradient consisting of 8-31% B in 240 min (B=90% ACN, 0.1% formic acid) at 200 nL/min. Peptides were ionized using a Picotip emitter nanospray needle (New Objective). Each MS run consisted of enhanced FT-resolution spectra (120,000 resolution) in the 390-1,200 m/z range followed by data-dependent MS/MS spectra of the 20 most intense parent ions acquired along the chromatographic run. The AGC target value for the survey scan was set to 10 <ref type="bibr">6</ref>. Fragmentation in the Orbitrap was performed at 33% normalized collision energy with a target value of 10,000 ions. The full target was set to 30,000, with 1 microscan and 100 ms injection time, and the dynamic exclusion was set to 0.5 min. A total of 5 MS data sets, two from unfractionated material and three from the corresponding MCX fractions, were registered with 25 h total acquisition time. For peptide identification the MS/MS spectra were searched with the SEQUEST HT algorithm implemented in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f28ff52afc-software-20">Proteome Discoverer</rs> <rs corresp="#f28ff52afc-software-20" resp="#annotator5" type="version">1.4.0.29</rs> (<rs corresp="#f28ff52afc-software-20" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Thermo Scientific</rs>). Database searching against human protein sequences from the UniProt database (September 2014, 147,615 entries) was performed with the following parameters: trypsin digestion with 2 maximum missed cleavage sites; precursor and fragment mass tolerances of 2 Da and 0.02 Da, respectively; carbamidomethyl and methylthio Cys and Met oxidation as dynamic modifications; and Nterminal and Lys iTRAQ modifications as fixed modifications. The results were analyzed using the probability ratio method <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> and the FDR (False Discovery Rate) for peptide identification was calculated based on the search results against a decoy database using the refined method <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>.</p>
            <p>A second cohort of patients (n=20) was independently considered for orthogonal validation analyses. Mitochondria were obtained from mature frozen adipocytes using the Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Cat. ab110171, Abcam), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentration of mitochondrial suspension was determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay. Ten μg of protein extracts were loaded, resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes which were stained with 0.15% Ponceau red to ensure proper transfer and then blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA in TBS buffer with 0.1% Tween 20. The primary antibodies used for protein validation were 1:2000 rabbit anti-SOD2 (ADI-SOD-111, Enzo Life Sciences); 1:5000 rabbit anti-CS (C5498, Sigma-Aldrich); 1:2000 mouse anti-COX5B (sc-374417, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 1:2000 mouse anti-VDAC1 (ab14734), 1:1000 rabbit anti-TFAM (ab47517), 1:1000 mouse anti-NDUFA9 (ab14713), 1:1000 rabbit anti-SDHC (ab155999) and 1:1000 mouse Total OXPHOS Human WB Antibody Cocktail (ab11041) including anti-UQCRC2 (ab14745), anti-MTCO2 (ab110258) and anti-ATP5A1 (ab14748) (Abcam). Blots were incubated with the appropriate IgG-HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were visualized with Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare). Blots were exposed for different times. Exposures in the linear range of signal were selected for densitometric evaluation with <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="f28ff52afc-software-simple-3">Image J</rs> analysis software. Additionally, infrared-labeled secondary antibodies were also used (Li-Cor Biosciences). The bands were detected using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (<rs corresp="#f28ff52afc-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Li-Cor Biosciences</rs>), and the images were analyzed with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f28ff52afc-software-0">Odyssey Application</rs> Software.</p>
            <p>Descriptive results of continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

Oneway ANOVA (using Bonferroni's post hoc test) was used to compare the anthropometrical and clinical data from the patients. The relation between variables was evaluated by Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. Unpaired Student's t-test was used for direct comparisons between two groups of samples. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05 in all cases. A 1% peptide FDR threshold was considered. Peptide and protein abundance changes were assessed using the iTRAQ reporter ion intensities retrieved from MS/MS scans by <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="f28ff52afc-software-simple-9">QuiXoT</rs> software <ref type="bibr">[30,31]</ref> as inputs to the WSPP model <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref>. This model circumvents the statistical issues reported for protein quantitation from iTRAQlabeled peptides <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref> and, by decomposing the different variance components, takes into account variance non-homogeneity and the highly unbalanced structure of this kind of data <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref>. The model also provides a robust framework for the full integration of quantitative and error information from a given level to a superior level (e.g. peptide to protein); thus, the standardized variable, Zq, is defined as the meancorrected log 2 ratio expressed in units of standard deviation at the protein level. For the quantitation of Cys oxidation, oxCys peptide abundance was evaluated by the corresponding standardized log 2 ratio, Zp, therefore avoiding biased calculations due to changes in the abundance of the proteins from which these peptides originated <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>. The threshold for differential protein and peptide abundance was set at |Zq|≥2 and |Zp|≥2, respectively. For the analysis of coordinated protein responses <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref> a standardized log 2 ratio, Zc, was calculated for each functional protein category. Categories with at least 5 protein components and FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered significantly differential and were subjected to cluster analysis.</p>
            <p>The database used for ontological protein classification contained ca. 2.3·10 6 functional categories with relevance to adipose tissue and obesity.

            <p>T cell populations secreting both IFN- and IL-10 are found in both mouse and man <ref type="bibr">(Trinchieri, 2007; O'Garra and Vieira, 2007; Haringer et al., 2009</ref>) and have been implicated in regulating the immune response to persistent infections with intracellular pathogens <ref type="bibr">(Trinchieri, 2001; Anderson et al., 2007; Jankovic et al., 2007)</ref>. The common feature of these infections is the development of a chronic stage of disease characterized by IL-10 secretion whereby low levels of the pathogen prevail and provide protection against subsequent reinfection. Under these circumstances, IL-10 plays a Flow cytometry. Staining for intracellular cytokine expression was performed using the CytoFix/CytoPerm Plus kit with GolgiStop (BD). CD4 + T cell cultures were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 5 ng/ml and 500 ng/ml of culture, respectively, for 3 h in the presence of GolgiStop. Cells were surface stained with anti-V8 FITC, and intracellularly with anti-IL-2 APC, anti-IL-4 PE, anti-IL-10 APC, anti-IL-17 PE, and anti-IFN- PE antibodies, or isotype controls (BD). For T-bet staining, enriched IL-10-secreting cells were stained with surface anti-V8 and intracellularly with either anti-T-bet Alexa Fluor 647 or mouse IgG1 isotype control antibody, using permeabilization buffers recommended by the manufacturer (eBioscience). For DC co-stimulatory molecule staining, splenic DCs were cultured either alone or with an equal number of CD4 + T cells from naive or peptide-treated mice in the presence of 100 µg/ml of Ac1-9[4K] and, where indicated, with 10 µg/ml of anti-IL-10R (clone 1B1.3a) or isotype control (BD) antibody. After 24 h, DCs were surface stained with anti-CD11c FITC, anti-CD40 PE and biotinylated anti-CD80 and anti-CD86 (BD) paired with Streptavidin Tricolor (Invitrogen). Fluorescence intensity was measured on a FACSCalibur or BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD) and analyzed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="ccac5e11d1-software-2">FlowJo</rs> (<rs corresp="#ccac5e11d1-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Tree Star, Inc</rs>.)

Multiplex Fluorescent Bead Immunoassay was used to measure the amount of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-17, and IFN- in mouse serum samples according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bender MedSystems). Fluorescence intensity was measured on a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD) and analyzed using the manufacturer's own software. Conventional sandwich ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions to assay the quantity of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IFN- (paired antibodies), and IL-12 (OptEIA kit; BD) in cell culture supernatants.

            <p>Five multivariate linear models were successively fitted to examine associations between HbA 1c and measures of OSA severity after controlling for multiple covariates. Model 1 included demographic variables traditionally associated with glycemic control, namely, age, sex, ethnicity-based diabetes risk, BMI, years of type 2 diabetes, and insulin use. Model 2 included all the covariates in model 1 plus total AHI. Model 3 included all the covariates in model 1 plus NREM AHI. Model 4 included all the covariates in model 1 plus REM AHI. Lastly, model 5 included all the covariates in model 1 plus NREM AHI and REM AHI. Since there are individuals who have a significant number of apneas and hypopneas during REM sleep while having an overall AHI below 5 (hence no OSA based on current definitions), we included all 115 subjects (with or without OSA) in the multivariate regression models in order to explore the entire spectrum of REM and NREM events (AHI, ODI, and MAI). We formally ruled out any evidence of collinearity among the variables entered in the models using standard statistics, including "tolerance" and "variance inflation factor" (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="e9c5918386-software-0">SPSS Statistics</rs> v<rs corresp="#e9c5918386-software-0" resp="#annotator10" type="version">20</rs>,<rs corresp="#e9c5918386-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">IBM</rs>, Armonk, NY). Values for HbA 1c , years of type 2 diabetes, and REM and NREM AHI were submitted to natural log (Ln) transformation. In order to deal with zero values, the total AHI, REM AHI, and NREM AHI were log transformed using the formula AHI = log(AHI + 0.01). A similar procedure was used for years of type 2 diabetes. We used casewise diagnostics to identify any outliers. Only one outlier was identified (low HbA 1c ), and sensitivity analysis excluding this subject was performed confirming the association between HbA 1c and measures of REM OSA severity. Goodness of fit of the models was assessed using diagnostic plots.</p>

            <p>After fasting for least 6 h, patients were administered 370 MBq of 18 F-FDG intravenously. All patients were instructed to rest comfortably for 60 min and to urinate before scanning. Wholebody PET-CT images were obtained with a Discovery ST scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Seven to eight frames (3 min per frame) of emission PET data were acquired in 3D mode after a non-contrast CT scan from the base of the skull to the upper thigh (tube rotation time of 1 s per revolution, 120 kV, 60 mA, 7.5 mm per rotation and an acquisition time of 60.9 s for a scan length of 867 mm). Emission PET images were reconstructed using an iterative method (ordered-subsets expectation maximization with 2 iterations and 30 subsets; field of view, 600 mm; slice thickness, 3.27 mm) and attenuation corrected with noncontrast CT. Two nuclear medicine physicians reviewed 18 F-FDG PET-CT images on an <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="ecc2404bb9-software-0">AW workstation</rs> (v. <rs corresp="#ecc2404bb9-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">4.4</rs>; <rs corresp="#ecc2404bb9-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GE Healthcare</rs>, Milwaukee, WI) by consensus. Focal 18 F-FDG uptake with intensity higher than that of normal background soft tissue on PET image was considered to be positive for metastasis. CT images were used for anatomic localization, but not for decision making. For the semi-quantitative analysis of <ref type="bibr">18</ref> F-FDG uptake, standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated based on injected dose and body weight. Circular regions of interest were placed on the ALN and maximum SUVs (SUV max ) were recorded.

            <p>Cell culture. NIH3T3, MEFs, MCF10a and primary keratinocyte cells were maintained as described in <ref type="bibr">11,33,42,43</ref>, respectively. Generation of ecotropic mGFP and GFP-H3 virus and cell transduction was carried out as previously described. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Transfection of NIH3T3 cells with nontargeting and ROCK1 Smartpool (Dharmacon, Loughborough, UK) siRNA was performed as previously described. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> Murine RAW-264.7 macrophages were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Microscopy. Time-lapse microscopy images were acquired with a Â 20 lens using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with a heated stage and 5% CO 2 gas line. Gray scale image is transmitted light. Cells were grown on optical glass coverslips and apoptosis was induced in a starved medium supplemented with TNFa/CHX and 5 mg/ml PI. Immediately after the induction of apoptosis, cells were relocated to confocal microscope and time-lapse images were taken every 30 s for 8 h in both transmitted light and red fluorescence. High resolution still images of unfixed apoptotic cells were acquired with a Â 60 oil immersion lens using same conditions as above. The medium was further supplemented with FAST DiO (3,3'-dilinoleyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate; Invitrogen) diluted 1 : 500 from 2.5 mg/ml dissolved in 100% DMSO. Transmission and SEM was performed as described in <ref type="bibr">33</ref> N 4 (Silantes, Munich, Germany). Label incorporation was determined to be 495% by MS before cells were used for further experiments. Each labeled population of NIH3T3 were assigned specific treatments, for example, light, control; medium, TNFa/ CHX; and heavy, TNFa/CHX þ Y27632. Each labeled population was used in each treatment condition, with Blebbistatin substituting for Y27632 in one set of experiments, for a total of six replicates. After 4 h, the supernatants were pooled and concentrated with StrataClean resin. Protein was eluted from StrataClean resin using 100 ml 1X lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer plus 10 mM DTT at 951C for 5 min. This was allowed to cool, adjusted to 50 mM iodoacetamide and incubated in the dark for 20 min at room temperature. Macrophage extracts (in 8 M urea) were adjusted to 1X LDS sample buffer, reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide as described above. The samples were electrophoresed for 3 cm on a NuPAGE 4-12% gel using MOPS running buffer (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) at 200 V and then stained with colloidal coomasie. The gel lane was cut into five even sections, each section cut into 2-mm cubes, destained with 50% acetonitrile/100 mM TEAB pH 8, dried and digested with 1 mg/ml trypsin in 50 mM TEAB overnight at 301C. Gel pieces were extracted with 50% acetonitrile, extracts combined, dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 0.1 ml 5% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid in water. In some experiments, macrophage extracts (50 mg) were reduced and alkylated in 8 M urea, diluted to 1 M urea with 50 mM TEAB pH 8 and digested in solution with trypsin (1 : 10 w/w) at 301C for 5 h. Tryptic digests were analyzed by LC-MS on a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer system coupled to a Proxeon Easy-LC HPLC system. The peptide mixtures were loaded onto a nanoseparations C18 guard column (0.1 Â 20 mm) equilibrated in 0.1% formic acid/water at 5 ml/min and then separated on an LC-Packings PepMap C18 column (0.075 Â 150 mm equilibrated in 0.1% formic acid/water. Peptides were eluted with a 120 min discontinuous gradient of acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The column outlet was connected to a Proxeon Flex nanospray source fitted with a New Objective FS360 20-10 uncoated emitter and a voltage of 2 kV was applied to the emitter. The orbitrap was set to analyze the survey scans (m/z 350-2000) at 30 000 resolution and top 10 ions in each duty cycle (minimum ion intensity of 5000 cps) were selected for MSMS in the LTQ linear ion trap. Ions were excluded for 20 s after two occurrences.

The patients were divided into two groups according to the CRP measured preoperatively: those with CRP values in the normal range (#10 mg/L) and those with elevated CRP levels (.10 mg/L). The Pearson Chi-squared test was used to determine the significance of differences between the two groups. The overall cumulative probability of survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference was assessed by the log-rank test. A univariate analysis was used to examine the association between various prognostic predictors and survival. Possible prognostic factors associated with overall survival were considered in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (Enter). Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to quantify the strength of the association between predictors and survival. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>

To determine the relationship between self-reported academic performance and the different independent variables, bivariate Pearson's correlation analysis was done three times (for total participants, and for preclinical, and clinical student subcategories). Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the cumulative and individual effects of each independent variable as well as to control confounding effects.</p>

            <p>The mice were treated with vp-genkwa before and after HSV-1 infection, and the splenocytes were prepared from infected mice 3 days post-infection (dpi). NK cells were enumerated by FACS staining using a cocktail of CD3 (145-2C11), NK1.1 (PK136), and NKp46 (29A1.4.9) antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). To determine the activity of NK cells, we used intracellular staining for IFN-γ and granzyme B (GrB) in response to stimulation of PMA (750 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) plus ionomycin (50 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, prepared splenocytes were cultured with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of monensin (2 μM; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h for IFN-γ and 4 h for GrB. Cells were harvested and labeled with CD3, NK1.1, and NKp46 antibodies, and subsequently stained with intracellular IFN-γ and GrB after fixation and permeabilization.

Concentration differences between the TPE and MPE groups were evaluated for statistical significance using the nonparametric MannWhitney U-test. The optimal sensitivity and specificity points were selected as the critical values using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; in this way, we calculated, for each of the TMs, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for diagnosing TPE and MPE. In addition, we evaluated the ability of a combination of all five TMs to distinguish between TPE and MPE. Three prognostic models were constructed: Model 1 involved the serum level of TMs, Model 2 the pleural fluid level, and Model 3 the P/S ratio. P &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

            <p>The second data set consisted of a total of 487 students including 217 boys and 270 girls in pubertal stage (aged 11.5-14.5 years) and 558 students including 382 boys and 276 girls in postpuberal stage (aged 14.5-18.5 years) which were randomly sampled by a multistage random sampling procedure from guidance and high schools of the four educational districts of Shiraz in the Spring of 2011. Determination of sample size was conducted in a similar procedure as the former study described above. Two guidance schools and two high schools were selected randomly and in each grade of the schools a random sample of the students were selected. In this study, weight, height, MUAC, and age were measured using the same techniques and devices as the former one by two trained auxologists, except TST which was measured to the nearest 0.5 mm. In this study, no exact criteria were used to classify participants in pubertal and post-pubertal categories. However, based on the mean and median age of girls and boys in different pubertal stages reported in the studies performed previously in Iran <ref type="bibr">[19-20]</ref>, we categorized students in guidance school to pubertal stage and those in high school to post-pubertal stage. The subjects' body mass index was obtained as weight divided by squared height in metric system (kg/m 2 ). The LMS method <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref> was applied to calculate sexspecific weight-for-height, BMI-for-age, MUAC-forage, and also TST-for-age centiles in each of the three stages of maturity. The growth reference centile charts for prepubertal children were provided in the previous studies <ref type="bibr">[22-25]</ref>. Although there is still no comprehensive consensus on how to define underweight and overweightness based on growth reference centiles, in this study the 5 th and 95 th centiles (according to a number of references <ref type="bibr">[22, 26-27]</ref> were selected as cut-off points to identify underweight and obese children, respectively. Kappa statistic was used to assess the pairwise agreement of the WH, BMI, MUAC and TST for classifying underweight and obese children. A value of zero indicates no concordance and a value of unity indicates perfect concordance. Kappa coefficient greater than 0.75 represents excellent agreement, between 0.40 and 0.75 fair to good agreement, and smaller than 0.40 poor agreement <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the linear association of anthropometric measures. Data analysis was performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d6c25e6117-software-simple-0">LMSchartmaker</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="d6c25e6117-software-1">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#d6c25e6117-software-1" resp="#annotator12" type="version">11.5</rs> softwares. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents the descriptive statistics of height, weight, BMI, MUAC and TST of school children classified by age and sex. Based on independent sample t-test, no significant gender difference was observed in terms of their BMI in all age groups (P&gt;0.05) with the exception of the last age group inwhich the boys had a significantly greater BMI as compared to the girls. In addition, in younger children (less than 11.5 years), there was no significant difference between the two genders regarding their weight and height, though in older ones the weight and height of the boys was significantly higher than those of the girls. In terms of MUAC, just in the middle-aged children as well as the last age group significant differences were observed between boys and girls in which boys' MUAC was greater than that of girls. However, the girls' TST was thicker than that of the boys (p-value&lt;0.05) in the age groups of 9.5 to 14.49 and 16.5-17.49 years, reflecting a reverse pattern between boys and girls compared to the other indices. The pubertal stage and sex-specific prevalence of thinness and obesity based on the four aforementioned growth reference centiles are presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Generally, obesity was more prevalent than thinness.</p>

Chi-square analysis was omitted due to the wide range of responses with many possible answers (departments) showing zero percentile frequency. For each survey question, the top three departments were analyzed; the fourth-ranked departments and beyond showed a sharp drop-off in response rate, with many having a zero response rate. Effective percentages per department are shown in the Appendix 1. The departments with the lowest response rates were extremely diverse, and were not considered of significance.</p>

            <p>Both datasets were analyzed equally by permutation analysis. The KC-SMART permutation analysis was performed to create a null distribution, and peaks were detected at P &lt; 0.05 (Bonferroni corrected for multiple testing), for kernel widths: 6 = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30 and 40 Mb. One thousand permutations were used. The interpolation, as discussed below, was performed for an interval [2, 40] Mb, with steps of 0.2 Mb and was only applied to the mouse dataset. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="b71a5e69f7-software-simple-0">MATLAB</rs> scripts used for implementation of the method are available from the authors upon request.</p>
            <p>The cancer gene census (CGC) list was retrieved from the Internet (www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/). Mapping information was retrieved from the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b71a5e69f7-software-1">Ensembl</rs> database (<rs corresp="#b71a5e69f7-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">www.ensembl.org</rs>) using the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="b71a5e69f7-software-simple-3">Biomart</rs> data mining tool. Only genes with valid mapping information were used. The genes described in the CGC were divided according to their label 'recessive' or 'dominant'. This resulted in 275 unique dominant genes and 65 recessive genes. Enrichment for genes labeled as dominant was tested in gains and enrichment for genes labeled as recessive genes was tested in losses. For enrichment analysis of the genes in the Chin dataset, only those genes with measured gene expression profiles were used and only those genes with an <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b71a5e69f7-software-simple-4">ENSEMBL</rs>-gene identifier.

            <p>Genes found significant by correlation were compiled into gene lists according to method (KC-SMART, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b71a5e69f7-software-simple-5">STAC</rs>) and according to gain/loss status. Only genes with valid Entrez and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b71a5e69f7-software-simple-6">Ensembl</rs> IDs that were present on the gene expression microarray platform were considered.

The P values are two-sided. Although <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows comparisons of baseline characteristics between the 74 progressors (76% of all progressors in the oral insulin trial) who had at least one FPIR measurement after the baseline measurement (those included in the analyses below) and 270 nonprogressors (those not diagnosed during follow-up). Aside from the younger age of the progressors (P = 0.003), there were initially no significant differences in FPIR, log BMI, and sex. However, because the FPIR was associated with both age (r = 0.17, P = 0.001) and log BMI (r = 0.38, P , 0.001), we compared the FPIR between the progressors and the nonprogressors after adjusting for those variables. The baseline FPIR was significantly lower in the progressors (P , 0.020) with the adjustments. Additionally, with adjustments for age and sex, the BMI was significantly higher in the progressors (P = 0.035). The median duration of follow-up for the oral insulin trial participants was 4.3 years. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows FPIR values of the 26 progressors according to the time before diagnosis along with the percent change in the FPIR (per year) from the preceding FPIR. (Data are presented in the table and below according to the mean time from diagnosis of the FPIR measurements within each yearlong interval.) There was a small decline in the FPIR from baseline until 1.5 years before diagnosis, with no evidence of acceleration. The decline then accelerated from 1.5 years before diagnosis to 0.5 years before diagnosis. The median (25th, 75th percentile) percent change in FPIR from 2.5 to 1.5 years before diagnosis was 24.1% (229.8%, 30.2%, not significant), whereas the median percent change from 1.5 to 0.5 years before diagnosis was 229.3% (256.4%, -3.5%, P 5 0.001). Of the 26 progressors, the FPIR declined in 21 from 1.5 to 0.5 years before diagnosis and in 14 from 2.5 to 1.5 years before diagnosis. Compared with the change from 2.5 to 1.5 years before diagnosis, there was a decline (vs. a prior increase) or a more marked decline from 1.5 to 0.5 years before diagnosis in 16. The median overall percent change from the baseline FPIR to the last FPIR was 247.7% (258.2%, -27.7%, P , 0.001).</p>

            <p>The statistical procedures employed were consistent with those used previously (3) to provide continuity and provide a basis for comparison between studies. The data were analysed initially using multiple regression analysis by assessing the associations between ovarian hormones (FSH and LH) as independent variables and ovarian hormones/AFC as dependent variables. A multivariate regression model with FSH and LH as dependent variables and other ovarian factors as predictors was also developed. Data were evaluated in 3-day windows across the entire follicular phase, in two divisions of the follicular phase termed FP1 (including Men and EFP groups) and FP2 (MLP and LFP groups) and the luteal phase. In some analyses, age was sub-grouped into &lt;40 years and ≥40 years. The slope coefficients for the various comparisons were determined following log transformation (referred to as ln_outcome) of both outcome and predictors. Data transformation permitted a comparison of the magnitude of the slope values between different outcome and predictors. A significant slope value for a given comparison was established when its 95% CIs did not include 0, as previously reported <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>.

            <p>Immunoprecipitation of the concentrated proteins was carried out with protein A sepharose beads (10-1141, Invitrogen) essentially as described by the manufacturer. 293T cells were transfected with phCMV empty vector, phCMV-syncyntin-2 WT, phCMV-syncytin-2 N312Q and phCMV-syncytin-2 T522M plasmids, respectively. After transfection for 48 h, the cells were lysed by suspension in ice-cold lysis buffer for 1 h. Lysates were collected after centrifugation at 12,000 g for 20 min and immunoprecipitated with 3 mg anti-syncytin-2 antibody.

            <p>As is clear from the phenotypes described in this study, MKKK18oe lines show different responses to ABA stimulus depending on developmental stage and cell type. For example, germinating MKKK18oe seedlings exhibit a weak ABAinsensitive phenotype <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3E)</ref>, while overexpression of MKKK18 also causes ABA-hypersensitive stomatal closing and root growth <ref type="figure">(Figs. 3C, 4F)</ref>. This suggests that similar MKKK18-based signaling pathways may operate in these processes, but the oppositemutants were treated with 100 mM ABA for the indicated times. A 600 mg aliquot of total protein was used for the immune complex MKKK18 activity assay using anti-MKKK18 antibody. Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining of MBP confirmed equal loading. Due to low abundance, the endogenous MKKK18 protein was not detectable by immunoblot analysis. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments (n = 9) with consistent results. (B) 32 P-labeled MBP bands were quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="ee1f8a0794-software-simple-0">ImageJ</rs> software and normalized by taking the radioactivity of the band in the absence of ABA as 1. Data are means ± SD of the relative band intensities from three independent experiments (n = 9). phenotypic responses to ABA stimulus may also be observed, indicating that MKKK18 signaling integrates various pathways.</p>
            <p>Protein kinase autoactivation, via phosphorylation of the activation loop, is a common regulatory mechanism that switches the status of the signaling cascades to standby. Very recently, it was shown that recombinant GST-MKKK18 is able to autophosphorylate in vitro <ref type="bibr">(Matsuoka et al. 2015)</ref>. Our data appear to contradict this result. Compared with a positive control, SnRK2.6 kinase <ref type="bibr">(Ng et al. 2011)</ref>, we conclude that MKKK18 does not undergo autoactivation <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref>. In our hands, GST-MKKK18 autophosphorylates neither during production in bacterial cells nor in in vitro kinase assays <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7C)</ref>. Our results suggest, therefore, that MKKK18 must be activated by an upstream kinase (possibly a receptor kinase or another type of protein kinase) <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref> Proteasome-dependent degradation of MKKK18 is ABA-dependent and regulated by ABI1. (A) qPCR analysis of MKKK18 transcript accumulation in response to treatment with 50 mM ABA for 90 min in WT Col-0, MKKK18oe, abi1td and abi1-2 strains. MKKK18 expression levels were determined using three biological replicates and were normalized against 18S rDNA. The results are displayed as mean log 2 fold change ± SE (n = 9) of three independent experiments with consistent results. (B) MKKK18 stability in the cell-free degradation assay. GST-MKKK18 was incubated with 100 mg of protein extract from either WT Col-0 or abi1td protoplasts incubated with or without 100 mM MG132 for 6 h in the dark. GST-MKKK18 protein levels at the indicated time points were determined by immunoblotting using anti-GST antibodies. Ponceau S staining confirmed equal loading. (C and D) Half-life plot for cell-free degradation of MKKK18 in WT Col-0 (C) and abi1td (D) extracts. Immunoblot images from each experiment were recorded simultaneously using a G:BOX Chemi XR5 fluorescence and chemiluminescence imaging system (Syngene), and the results were quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="ee1f8a0794-software-simple-1">ImageJ</rs> software. (E) CHX treatment suppresses accumulation of MKKK18. Arabidopsis protoplasts expressing 35S:MKKK18-GFP were treated with 3 mM CHX, 3 mM CHX and 100 mM MG132, or given a mock treatment. The blot is representative of four experiments. MKKK18-GFP protein levels were determined by immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibodies. Ponceau S staining confirmed equal loading. MKKK18 protein bands were quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="ee1f8a0794-software-simple-2">ImageJ</rs> software and normalized to the control (mock) band (set as 1). (F) MKKK18 protein levels are modified by ABA. GST-MKKK18 was incubated with 100 mg of total protein extract isolated from WT Col-0 incubated with or without 50 mM ABA for 3 h in the dark. GST-MKKK18 protein levels at the indicated time points were determined by immunoblotting using GST antibodies. Ponceau S staining confirmed equal loading. MKKK18 protein bands were quantified using<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="ee1f8a0794-software-simple-3">ImageJ</rs> software and normalized to the control band (set as 1).</p>
            <p>The SI was calculated based on the method described in <ref type="bibr">Tanaka et al. (2013)</ref>. Counts of stomata and pavement cells were performed on five areas of each cotyledon from 10 separate seedlings, giving 100 measurements per experiment, using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope with a Nikon Digital Sight DS-Fi1c <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref> Regulation of MKKK18 activity and stability by ABI1 PP2C. Under standard conditions, active ABI1 protein phosphatase inhibits MKKK18 kinase activity and protein stability. ABA receptors and dephosphorylated MKKK18 are directed for degradation via the proteasome pathway. In the presence of ABA, ABI1 PP2C activity is restrained by binding of ABI1 to the ABA-PYL complex (ABA signaling is turned on). Active MKKK18 activates the downstream cascade. ABA inhibits the degradation of ABA receptors by limiting their polyubiquitination. camera. The SI was calculated individually for each cotyledon using the formula: SI = [number of stomata/(number of other epidermal cells + number of stomata)]. For statistical analysis, Student's t-test was performed. For guard cell aperture measurements, rosette leaves of 5-week-old plants were floated in opening buffer (10 mM KCl, 7.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MES-KOH, at pH 6.15) and incubated at 20 C under light conditions for 2 h to open the stomata. Subsequently, the same opening buffer was supplemented with either 15 mM ABA, 1 mM H 2 O 2 or 1 mM CaCl 2 , and the leaves were incubated for another 2 h. The stomatal apertures (width divided by length) along three different epidermal transects were measured using a Nikon Eclipse Ti (with Nikon Digital Sight DS-Fi1c digital camera) and <rs corresp="#ee1f8a0794-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Nikon</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ee1f8a0794-software-0">NIS Elements AR</rs> software.

            <p>CRISPRs' in silico analyses started in 1995 (2) but no specific stand-alone CRISPR software tool was created. Several software were used by different authors to identify these particular repeats but usually a manual discard of background was necessary, and generally some CRISPR clusters were missed or neglected, especially the shortest one (less than three motifs). This is the case, for example, of Tandem Repeat Finder (17) when considering a motif (DR þ spacer) as a degenerate repeat <ref type="bibr">(10,18)</ref>, or Locating Uniform poly-Nucleotide Areas (LUNA), a program for finding degenerate repeats in microbial genomes on a desktop computer. The repeats can be filtered using several parameters including length, distance and level of conservation. LUNA was used especially for finding CRISPRs in archaea <ref type="bibr">(4,15)</ref>. Another program, Patscan (19) a pattern-matching tool that searches sequences fitting the introduced pattern, was applied toidentify CRISPRs containing at least three <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref> or four exact direct repeats <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref>. PYGRAM (21) is a visualization program browsing all the repeats in the submitted genomic sequence and showing perfectly conserved palindromic repeats as pyramids. The PYGRAM program is mostly efficient in visually displaying large CRISPRs (CRISPRs with as many as seven motifs are considered as being very short in this work) since they will be recognized as a concentration of horizontal bars referring to a group of co-occurring repeats that differ by only a few nucleotides. Finally, Haft et al. <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref> used <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b308e79ccf-software-0">REPfind</rs> (<rs corresp="#b308e79ccf-software-0" resp="#curator" type="url">http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/reputer/</rs>), a part of the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b308e79ccf-software-simple-2">REPuter</rs> package <ref type="bibr">(22-24)</ref> and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b308e79ccf-software-simple-3">BLASTN</rs> to identify smaller repeat clusters.</p>
            <p>These programs are the most used tools in CRISPR detection, although none of them is especially conceived for this purpose. They require further manual manipulations to eliminate background data (tandem repeats for example) and importantly, do not define accurately the DR consensus (due to errors on the boundaries). Recently, two CRISPR-dedicated software tools were proposed, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="b308e79ccf-software-3">CRT</rs> (<rs corresp="#b308e79ccf-software-3" resp="#annotator10" type="url">http://www.room220.com/crt</rs>) and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="b308e79ccf-software-simple-6">PILER-CR</rs> <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. Both of them run fast and perform well in finding CRISPRs. However, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b308e79ccf-software-simple-7">CRT</rs> results in a considerable background since tandem repeats are considered as putative CRISPRs and in addition, the same CRISPR is sometimes detected more than once with different consensus DRs. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b308e79ccf-software-simple-8">PILER-CR</rs> has also some drawbacks since it often misidentifies the DR boundaries and omits the truncated DR.</p>
            <p>In the first step, maximal repeats are found by the software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="b308e79ccf-software-5">Vmatch</rs> (<rs corresp="#b308e79ccf-software-5" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.vmatch.de</rs>/), the upgrade of <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b308e79ccf-software-simple-11">REPuter</rs> <ref type="bibr">(22-24)</ref>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b308e79ccf-software-simple-12">Vmatch</rs> is based on a comprehensive implementation of enhanced suffix arrays <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref> which provides the power of suffix trees with lower space requirements. A one nucleotide mismatch is allowed permitting minimal CRISPRs with a single nucleotide mutation between DRs to be found. Hereafter, the obtained maximal repeats are grouped to define regions of possible CRISPRs with a display of consensus DR candidates related to each cluster.</p>

Descriptive statistics such as, frequency tables and percentages were conducted to explore the general features of the data. The outcome variable (dependent) was the dental knowledge and attitude of HCPs who advised preventive dental measures. Preventive dental measures consisted of counseling parents regarding oral hygiene, recommending that parents seek dental checkups, visual examinations of the oral cavity and teeth to explore for causes of dental decay, age of first dental visit, number of tooth brushing per day, tolls of toothbrushing, persons responsible regarding the child's oral hygiene, sources of dental knowledge, and the main cause of dental decay. The independent (determinant) variables were age, gender, education level, type of job, and specialties. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to determine significance of variation, or the association at a 95% confidence level (p&lt;0.05).

            <p>Steady-state rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) assays. Reactions at 37 C contained 30 mM MES (pH 6.2), 6 mM MgCl 2 , 30 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mg/ml BSA in a final volume of 50 ml. The monovalent salt concentration was increased to 80 mM in certain reactions by the addition of 50 mM NaCl. In addition the reaction mixtures contained 2.0 mM wild-type or mutant Rad51 protein and 12 mM uX174 ssDNA. Reactions were initiated by the addition of a-[ 32 P]-ATP to a final concentration of 3 mM (10 mCi/ml final specific activity). Aliquots (8 ml) were removed at various time points and quenched with 8 mM EDTA and 1% SDS (final concentrations). Quenched samples were spotted out at 1 ml volume onto PEI-cellulose TLC plates (20 Â 20 cm) at 1-cm intervals. After all the samples were spotted and dried the TLC plates were developed with 0.75 M KH 2 PO 4 and allowed to air dry.

            <p>Separation of anthocyanins and non-anthocyanins was conducted on a reverse-phase Capcell Pak C18 UG 120 S5 column (4.6×150 mm I.D., 4 μm; Shiseido Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) using a Finnigan Surveyor high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Thermo Quest, San Jose, CA, USA) at an ambient temperature. The mobile phase was a binary elution of 5% formic acid solution (A) and 100% methanol (B) under the following gradient conditions: initial, 20% B; 7 min, 20% B; 15 min, 25% B; 32 min, 50% B; 36 min, 100% B; 38 min, 100% B; 40 min, 20% B and 45 min, 20% B. The flow rate was 700 μl/min, and the injection volume was 10 μl. Eluted substances were detected at 280 nm and 570 nm by using a photodiodearray detector between 200 and 600 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm. For the identification of major components, the column elute was split, and 0.2 ml·min -1 was directed to a Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion-trap MS (Thermo Quest, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface after passing through the flow cell of the photodiode-array detector. Analysis was carried out using positive ion monitoring at a capillary temperature of 280°C, spray voltage of 5.5 kV, capillary voltage of 10 V and tube lens offset of -5.0 V. Spectral data were recorded using He gas as a collision gas. Anthocyanins and non-anthocyanins were detected using m/z value following MS/MS. The MS/MS collision energy was set to 35%. Data were collected using dual analysis in fullscan mode from 100 to 1000 atomic mass units and MS/MS modes.

            <p>The total volume of drained blood and the decrease in hemoglobin at 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 5 days postoperatively were recorded. Blood transfusions were recorded as the number of units of packed erythrocytes. All patients were discharged from the hospital after two weeks of surgery. All quantitative data were expressed as mean±standard deviation. Statistical significance of differences in the mean values of continuous variables such as age, preoperative hemoglobin, total volume of drained blood, and postoperative decrease in hemoglobin level were determined using Student t-test.

The area under the OXPHOS protein complex 4-time curve (AUC OXPHOS4 ) from days 6 to 16 was calculated for each hollow-fiber arm from the toxicity studies using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f519737021-software-2">Prism</rs> software version <rs corresp="#f519737021-software-2" resp="#annotator2" type="version">6.01</rs> (<rs corresp="#f519737021-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GraphPad Software, Inc</rs>., La Jolla, CA). The complex 4 AUC OXPHOS from days 6 to 16 was graphed against the linezolid free-drug 24-h AUC exposure and free-drug trough concentrations achieved for each regimen in the HFIM system. An inhibitory sigmoid-E max effect model was fitted to the data using ADAPT V software. Parameter estimates were obtained employing maximum-likelihood estimation.</p>
            <p>The impact of linezolid on both the total M. tuberculosis burden and the less-susceptible subpopulation burden was analyzed in a population sense employing the program <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f519737021-software-4">BigNPAG</rs>, a nonparametric (for parameter distributions) adaptive grid program written by <ref type="bibr">Leary et al. and Neely et al (22, 23)</ref>. Starting weights were as estimates of the inverse of the observation variance for each of the three system outputs. The adaptive ␥ function in <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f519737021-software-simple-4">BigNPAG</rs> was employed to optimize the weights so as to give the best approximation to the homoscedastic assumption. The three system outputs were (i) measurement of linezolid concentration-time profiles in each HFIM arm, (ii) measurement of total M. tuberculosis burden in each HFIM arm, and (iii) measurement of the less linezolid-susceptible subpopulation in each HFIM arm.</p>

            <p>FTIR spectroscopy Spectra were recorded in the mid-infrared region (3200-900 cm À1 ) by a Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker, Massachusetts, USA). A nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector and an attenuated total reflection cell, Harric BioATRcell II , with a silicon crystal were used. The temperature of the attenuated total reflection cell was 30°C. Spectra were recorded using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="eca16cd71c-software-0">OPUS</rs> software version <rs corresp="#eca16cd71c-software-0" resp="#annotator14" type="version">7.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#eca16cd71c-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bruker</rs>, Massachusetts, USA). Gastric aspirate (20 lL) was transferred to a fresh vial containing 20 lL of internal standard (potassium thiocyanate 1 g/L). Then, 6 lL of this mixture was applied to the attenuated total reflection crystal. The sample was dried for two minutes under a gentle stream of air (40-45°C). Each sample was applied twice, and for each application, two spectra were recorded. The mean value of the four spectra was calculated, and the baseline was corrected and normalised with respect to the potassium thiocyanate peak at 2.000-2.110 cm À1 . The spectroscopy after pre-analytic handling of each sample was completed in less than 10 minutes.</p>

Protein samples (30 mg) were separated by 4-12% SDS-PAGE and products visualized and quantified with a PhosphorImager system with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="b832d821d4-software-1">ImageQuant</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b832d821d4-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Dynamics, GE Healthcare</rs>).</p>
            <p>In order to determine whether the OXPHOS defect in cells overexpressing PDE12 is a consequence of impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, we labelled the de novo synthesized mitochondrially encoded subunits of the electron transport chain with radioactive methionine. After the inhibition of cytosolic translation, the incorporation of <ref type="bibr">35</ref> S-Met into mitochondrial proteins was analysed over a time course of 4 days in HEK293T cells overexpressing PDE12 or the E351A catalytic mutant <ref type="figure">(Figure 6A)</ref>. Translation of all mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain subunits was compromised upon the induction of PDE12 overexpression and the incorporationwere analysed by northern blots using probes specific for all mitochondrial transcripts. Nuclear-encoded 28 S rRNA was used as a loading control. (D) Quantification of steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts in cells overexpressing PDE12. The values of the relative RNA levels (mt-RNA/28 S rRNA) were obtained by quantifying PhosphorImager scans of northern blots using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="b832d821d4-software-simple-4">ImageQuant</rs> software and normalized for the values obtained from uninduced cells. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001; n = 3, Error bars = 1 SD. (E) mtDNA copy number in cells overexpressing PDE12. Comparative Q-PCR of the mitochondrial CytB gene and single copy nuclear gene (APP) was used with total DNA isolated from cells overexpressing PDE12 for the indicated time. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001; n = 3, Error bars = 1 SD. of <ref type="bibr">35</ref> S-Met was $15% of those in uninduced cells <ref type="figure">(Figure 6B)</ref>. Overexpression of the E351A mutant did not have any appreciable effect upon mitochondrial protein synthesis <ref type="figure">(Figure 6B)</ref>. Next, we carried out gradient sedimentation analyses of cell extracts from cells overexpressing PDE12 for 4 days and control cells in order to investigate the integrity of the mitochondrial ribosome <ref type="figure">(Figure 6C)</ref>. In this method, we detected the 28 S (small) and 39 S (large) subunits by western blotting of gradient fractions. We used DAP3/MRPS29 as a marker for the 28 S ribosomal subunit and MRPL3 as a marker for the 39 S subunit. The analyses of sedimentation of mitoribosomal subunits upon overexpression of PDE12 revealed: (i) deficiency of assembled 28 S mitoribosomal subunits as compared to the control and (ii) anomalous sedimentation of the 39 S subunits that was shifted towards slower migrating species <ref type="figure">(Figure 6C)</ref>. These changes in mitoribosomes were not due to any alteration in the length of the mitochondrial rRNAs, based on RNase protection assays of 12 S and 16 S rRNA (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S4A-B)</ref>. Nor was the steady-state level or length of 7 mt-tRNAs (Ser-UCN, Leu-UUR, Thr, Gln, Pro, Lys and Phe) affected by elevated PDE12 expression (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S4C-D)</ref>. However, in the case of tRNASer-AGY the steady-state level of the full-length molecule was $60% of the control value after 4 days of PDE12 overexpression and a species of lower molecular mass was detected. A similar truncated form of tRNASer-AGY, albeit of much lower abundance, was observed in control cells (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S4C)</ref>. Mutant tRNA levels considerably &gt;50% are needed to produce a mitochondrial translation defect <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref> and so the observed inhibition of mitochondrial translation is most likely attributable to the shortening of the mt-RNA poly(A) tails, owing to mitochondrial ribosome instability and/or impaired assembly.</p>

            <p>The present study consisted of 16 elite Korean wrestling athletes and 95 nonathletes. Measurements were performed from March 2015 to August 2015. One hundred and eleven volunteers who had no abnormal physical or psychological conditions provided written informed consent to participation in this study <ref type="bibr">9)</ref>. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire via individual in-depth interviews, which took 30 minutes per person <ref type="bibr">9)</ref>. There were seven weight categories: gyungjang (less than 75 kg), sojang (less than 80 kg), chungjang (less than 85 kg), yongjang (less than 90 kg), yongsa (less than 95 kg), yeoksa (less than 110 kg), and jangsa (less than 150 kg) 9, 10) . The criteria for the inclusion of participants in the study were as follows: (1) 20-23 years of age, (2) male, (3) history of respiratory disease, (4) experience of stress during exercise, (5) psychological factors, (6) history of injuries, and (7) primary technology used. Before measurement, all participants rested for 30 minutes 9) . Chest and abdominal circumference were measured at rest under expiratory and inspiratory conditions 2) . Chest circumference was measured at the height of the axilla, and abdominal circumference was measured at the height of the navel. The respiration ability of participants was measured. The participants were measured by lung function testing using the SCHILLER SP-260 spirometer (SCHILLER AG, Baar, Switzerland). Spirometric parameters, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, peak expiratory flow (PEF), peak inspiratory flow (PIF), slow vital capacity (SVC), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), tidal volume (TV), maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), minute or expired ventilation (MV), and respiratory rate (RR) were recorded and analyzed by methods of resting breathing and forced breathing. Measurement was focused on the FVC graph, which was divided into the expiratory area (ExA) and the inspiratory area (InsA) 2) . The pixel values were measured using <rs corresp="#ca2a999e61-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Adobe</rs> <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="ca2a999e61-software-0">Photoshop</rs> <rs corresp="#ca2a999e61-software-0" resp="#annotator0" type="version">7.0.1</rs>. The ExA was divided into A and B sections based on the PEF. Analogously, the InsA was divided into C and D sections based on the PIF. Each A, B, C, and D section was further subdivided to four areas <ref type="figure">Fig. 1A)</ref>. From left to right, the connections between each of the divided points of the A area were designated as the first slope (AS1), the second slope (AS2), and the third slope (AS3). Correspondingly, from left to right, the first, second, and third slopes defining the B area were designated BS1, BS2, and BS3, respectively; the first, second, and third slopes defining the C area were designated CS1, CS2, and CS3, respectively; and the first, second, and third slopes defining the D area were designated DS1, DS2, and DS3, respectively <ref type="figure">Fig. 1A)</ref> 2) . After creating these subdivisions, the tangent and angle of each point were measured. The angle of each point and the respiratory area of the FVC were each measured in triplicate at each measurement time, and the mean values were calculated <ref type="bibr">2, 19)</ref>. The formula for the tangent is given in Equation 1, where r is the radius of a circle composed of the coordinates of the x and y axes. The cos θ is the value obtained by dividing x by r; sin θ is the value obtained by dividing y by r. The tan θ is equivalent to the ratio of the sin θ to the cos θ <ref type="bibr">2, 20)</ref>.</p>

The significance level was set to α=0.05, and all data are presented as the mean ± standard error (SE) of the measurements. One-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the significance between the groups. The Pearson correlation coefficient test was performed to identify correlations between the variables. The protocol for this study was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Research of Yong In University in accordance with the terms of Resolution 5-1-20. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the general characteristics of the Korean wrestling athletes compared with those of the nonathletes. Spirometry parameters in the athletes group were significantly higher than in the nonathletes, but not ERV, IRV, and MVV <ref type="table">Table 2)</ref>. Respirogram phasic analysis revealed that the expiratory (ExA) and total area (Total) of the FVC were significantly increased in the athletes compared with the nonathletes <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B)</ref>. The slopes of respirogram phases, such as the tangent angles, of the FVC were compared between nonathletes and athletes <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B)</ref>. The tangents for athletes at slopes 1, 2, and 3 of the A area (AS1, AS2, and AS3) were significantly increased <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B)</ref>. Furthermore, in the correlative analysis, chest and abdominal circumference were not correlated with the area of the FVC <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). The correlation coefficients for the chest circumference and tangent are shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>, with slope 3 of the A area (AS3) showing significant correlation.</p>

Normally distributed continuous variables were summarized using the mean and SD. Skewed variables were log-transformed for parametric analysis and summarized using the geometric mean and interquartile range. A one-way ANOVA test, or x 2 test, was used to compare the three groups at baseline for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. One-way ANOVA with linear trend test was used to examine differences in mean change (i.e., preintervention value minus postintervention value for a given continuous variable) between groups for the primary and secondary end points. Post hoc analyses were performed using the Dunnett test comparing the control group (one to two portions) with the intervention groups (four and seven portions). For each variable, intervention analysis was performed for all participants who had completed the study protocol according to randomization group. The test for linear trend (with changes in variable and portion allocation as the dependent and independent variables, respectively), analogous to linear regression, was incorporated in order to take account of the dose-response design. Variables that were not normally distributed were log-transformed prior to these analyses. A sample size of 30 patients per group gave the study 80% power to detect a 10% difference in GIR between groups at a 5% level of significance <ref type="bibr">(15,16)</ref>.</p>

Reliability Measures : Three measures of reliability were calculated, as follows: Cronbach's Alpha, a measure of internal consistency, calculated for the whole sample (N=155, data for 2 cases missing) separately for Section-I and Section-ll, was 0.9 and 0.67 respectively. Interrater reliability of 3 raters for 9 families was computed. The intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) for any single rater was 0.81 and average reliability for all 3 raters was 0.93, indicating good inter-rater reliability. Test-retest reliability was calculated for a sub-sample of families who were evaluated at intake and again after a mean duration of 4.5 months (N=110). Pearson's Yfor Section-I was 0.71 (p&lt;.01) and for Section-ll was 0.36 (p&lt;.01), indicating moderate to high testretest reliability.</p>

            <p>Using the available raw data (from the identified studies), a Bayesian NMA was performed for the purpose of yielding probabilistic conclusions.

The pairwise estimates are available in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.

            <p>The quantitative degree of bone regeneration was analyzed based on the virtual slices taken from the serial slice image segmentation every 8 µm from the cross-sectional images of the 3D reconstructions along the longitudinal direction.The resulting images are a map of the local X-ray attenuation coefficient plus the enhanced boundaries made by the interference of transmitting coherent X-rays. In the images, the newly formed bone fragments were clearly distinguished from the Bio-Oss ® in the gray level.

The slice images were noise filtered and then smoothed using the edge-preserving-smoothing function of the software. Segmentation was carried out based on the difference in the gray level between the Bio-Oss ® and the newly formed bone and the volume was calculated by counting the number of voxels belonging to each material. At each slice, the measurements were performed to calculate the percentage (ie, area fraction) of mineralized bone, residual graft material, and soft tissue components.</p>

Any application that was in effect at UNOS during this time period but was submitted and approved prior to January 1, 2005, was excluded from this data extraction and analysis. Other exclusions included applications for HCC that did not meet the criteria in Policy 3.6.4.4, including patients with tumors outside the T2 criteria and patients with "downstaged" tumors, because regional variances addressed many of these patients. This analysis also excluded patients automatically not approved due to some administrative reason (e.g., missed extension deadline).</p>

            <p>In situ trace element analyses of amphibole, clinopyroxene and plagioclase were carried out on polished thin sections by LA-ICP-MS using a Perkin Elmer ELAN 6100 DRC ICP-MS equipped with a 193 nm EXCIMER Geolas laser at the University of Lausanne (Switzerland). Operating conditions of the laser were: 8 Hz frequency, 100 mJ energy, 35 or 60 mm spot size. CaO contents determined by microprobe in the area of subsequent ablation with the laser were used for internal standardization by reference to an SRM612 NIST external standard. Raw data were reduced off-line using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="e363439274-software-simple-0">LAMTRACE</rs> software <ref type="bibr">55-57</ref>., the projected vapour1liquid coexistence surface for salinities of 10 wt.% and 30-45 wt.% NaCl (green, extrapolated above 1000uC) and the vapour1liquid1halite coexistence curve (blue) from <ref type="bibr">59</ref> (V5vapour, L5liquid, H5halite, F5single-phase fluid). The orange path 1 represents a hypothetical fluid-unsaturated (e.g., H 2 O52.5 wt.%) basaltic andesite/ andesite magma that ascends rapidly to shallow level until it becomes fluidsaturated upon hitting the 2.5 wt.% H 2 O boundary. This magma will exsolve a fluid below the vapour1liquid coexistence line and will not have significantly high Sr/Y because it will not fractionate amphibole. If the same magma undergoes isobaric crystallization at P. ,0.2 GPa (red paths 2) it will eventually become fluid-saturated in the single-phase fluid field, above the vapour1liquid coexistence line. Because amphibole always precedes plagioclase crystallization above the vapour1liquid coexistence line in andesitic magmas and almost at any pressure above the V1L coexistence line for basaltic andesite magmas (except a small gap between ,0.19 and ,0.22 GPa), it follows that development of high Sr/Y signatures and exsolution of fluids in the single phase field are intimately bound together. Hydrous andesitic magmas rising rapidly to shallow levels have magnetite close to the liquidus (orange path 1), which might cause sulphide saturation before fluid exsolution, depending on the initial water content of the magma. In contrast, andesitic magmas evolving at P.0.2 GPa and thus acquiring high Sr/Y signatures (red paths 2) will crystallize magnetite late thus making possible the partitioning of Cu into an exsolved fluid before magnetite-induced sulphide saturation incorporates magmatic Cu.</p>

            <p>The outcome of the drug-related ED visit was categorized into three groups: (1) discharged immediately after consultation with the ED physician, (2) admitted to the ED-observation ward for a maximum of 72 h, and (3) admitted to a hospital ward through the ED. Drug classification was performed according to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="a50343a228-software-3">MIMS</rs>.com Malaysia version <rs corresp="#a50343a228-software-3" resp="#annotator5" type="version">1.3.0</rs> <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>.</p>
            <p>Data were analyzed using statistical software (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a50343a228-software-1">SPSS</rs> version <rs corresp="#a50343a228-software-1" resp="#annotator2" type="version">21</rs>, <rs corresp="#a50343a228-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). The prevalence of ADE-related ED visits was calculated by dividing the number of patients with ADE-related ED visits by the total sample size. Descriptive analysis of socio-demographic, clinical, and drug-related variables was conducted. Results were presented as frequency (percentage) for categorical variables and mean (standard deviation [SD]) for numerical variables. The Chi squared goodness-of-fit test was used to determine the distribution of cases in a single categorical variable at a 0.05 significance (alpha) level.</p>
            <p>The ADE category with the highest prevalence rate in the current study was DTF, which accounted for more than one-half of ADE-related ED visits. This is consistent with a similar study conducted in a hospital ward in Malaysia <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>. In the current study, medication non-adherence was the major cause of DTF-related ED visits. The prevalence rate of DTF due to medication non-adherence reported was higher than that found in previous studies <ref type="bibr">[8, 15, 42-44]</ref>. This variation may be due to more patients with chronic diseases visiting our ED with ADE-related complaints. However, patients with underlying chronic illness were found to have a higher chance of medication non-adherence <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref>. Another reason for the higher prevalence rate of DTF due to medication non-adherence may be associatedwith the busy and overcrowded nature of some public hospitals in Malaysia, which may not allow adequate patient counseling, especially regarding medication adherence <ref type="bibr">[45, 46]</ref>. Medication non-adherence has become a silent burden of healthcare <ref type="bibr">[39, 44, 47]</ref>; thus, many intervention measures have been made to improve adherence to increase patient safety. Such interventions include patient education via verbal and written instructions, illustrations, and audiovisuals by healthcare providers, and reminders such as medication calendars, medication schedule alerts, stickers, box alarms, and pill timers. In Malaysia, efforts have been made to improve medication adherence, including the use of short message alerts, called <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a50343a228-software-simple-5">MySMS</rs> Ò , in some hospitals <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref> and the establishment of Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) services operated by pharmacists in some public hospitals. These services have resulted in significant improvements in medication adherence <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref>. Studies have shown that pharmacist interventions have played a major role in improving medication adherence, especially among patients with chronic illness. The pharmacist is an expert on drugs and has the skills and expertise to improve medication adherence and potentially minimize the prevalence of DTF-related ED visits <ref type="bibr">[50, 51]</ref>. More intervention measures are needed to improve medication adherence.</p>

            <p>High-definition (HD)-OCT (Cirrus high-definition 5000 OCT) with an axial resolution of 5 mm was performed on all 70 eyes with RP and 65 eyes of the normal controls. Cross-section images of 6 mm horizontal and vertical scans through the central fovea were obtained. A macular cube 512 Â 128 scan was obtained by Cirrus HD-OCT to obtain the central fovea thicknesses (CFT) and GCIPLT data. The macula thickness and the outer rings, bounded by 3 and 6 mm concentric circles, were constructed using the automated software algorithm. Central subfield thickness was defined as the average thickness in the central 1 mm subfield centered on the fovea. Average macular thickness, foveal thickness, outer macular (superior, nasal, inferior, and temporal) thicknesses, and macular volume were obtained for each eye. The GCA algorithm was incorporated into the newer <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="aae3d10b62-software-1">Cirrus OCT</rs> software version <rs corresp="#aae3d10b62-software-1" resp="#annotator0" type="version">6.5</rs> with the annulus of inner vertical and horizontal diameters of 1 and 1.2 mm, respectively, and outer vertical and horizontal diameters of 4 and 4.8 mm, respectively. As reported, <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref> the outer ring size includes the area where the GCL is thickest in a healthy eye. The GCA algorithm identifies the outer boundaries of RNFL and IPL, between which is the GCIPL layer. GCIPLT will be analyzed according to 8 parameters-average, minimum, and 6 sectors (superonasal, superior, superotemporal, inferotemporal, inferior, and inferonasal)-by the GCA algorithm embedded in Cirrus OCT. Grayscale images were used for a more precise identification and measurement of the EZ. Length was measured in the horizontal and vertical scans, and an average value was obtained. Outer retinal thickness (ORT) was defined as the region from the outer plexiform layer to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer/ Bruch complex, consisting of the outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, extend limiting membrane (ELM), myoid zone, EZ, interdigitation zone, and RPE/Bruch complex. ORT was measured 1 mm from the fovea in the horizontal and vertical scans, and an average value was obtained.</p>

            <p>BlastP algorithm was used to predict sequence homologs of ScoRsrA from NCBI nr database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih .gov/blast/db/). Multiple sequence alignment and generation of phylogenetic tree were done by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-0">MEGA4</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(31)</ref>. A probable structure of ScoRsrA was created based on the determined structure of R. sphaeroides ChrR (3; PDB ID:2Z2S) by using<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-1">Modeller</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(32)</ref>, and was visualized through <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-2">PyMOL</rs> <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref>. Sequence logos were generated by using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-3">TEXshade</rs> <ref type="bibr">(34,35)</ref>.</p>
            <p>We constructed a phylogenetic tree using a neighborjoining algorithm provided by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-4">MEGA4</rs> program <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Four reported redox-insensitive ZAS members were included in the phylogenetic analysis for comparison. These are RspChrR, BsuYlaD, BsuRsiW and ScoRsuA. Only the N-terminal ASD domain was included in multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction. The phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the majority of the retrieved homologs cluster closely with ScoRsrA (Group I), next to the second cluster (Group II), which harbors CglRshA from C. glutamicum <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. Known insensitive ZAS genes were clustered within Groups III and IV. For experimental analysis, we selected nine candidates from dispersed branches of group I and group II clusters <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>, open circles); Rv3221A (MtuRshA), MSMEG_1915 (M. smegmatis), BlinB_ 010200019545 (Brevibacterium linens), nfa45830 (Nocardia farcinica), RHA1_ro06382 (Rhodococcus jostii), FRAAL6009 (Frankia alni), Tfu_0549 (Thermobifida fusca), DIP0710 (C. diphtheria) and AAur_2640 (Arthrobacter aurescens). A candidate from a branch in Group IV, NCgl0852 (C. glutamicum), was also selected for experimental analysis. The corresponding genes were synthesized through PCR amplification of chromosomal DNA as described in 'Materials and Methods' section. We <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Phylogenetic relatedness of ScoRsrA homologs. A neighbor-joining tree of RsrA homologs were constructed by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-5">MEGA4</rs> with default parameters. In addition to 104 homologs retrieved by BlastP, ZAS factors which have been reported to be insensitive to oxidation (marked with diamonds) were included in the tree. Only the ASD that corresponds to ScoRsrA in each entry was compared. Sequence information for all entries is provided in the Supplementary Table S3. Reported redox-senstive RsrA homologs were marked with close circles. MtuRshA_M_tuberculosis_and_M_bovis represents 25 identical sequences from M. tuberculosis or M. bovis strains. The 10 homologs whose redox-sensitivity was experimentally examined in this study were marked with open circles. Homologs from non-actinobacteria were marked with open triangles. cloned these genes in pSET152H to replace the rsrA gene in the sigR-rsrA operon of S. coelicolor as diagramed in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>A. The resulting hybrid operons were introduced into the chromosome of DsigRrsrA strain through the att site. If the product of the cloned gene behaves similarly to ScoRsrA, it is expected to bind SigR in S. coelicolor and keep it inactive under non-stressed condition, but will release SigR to transcribe its target genes under oxidative stress conditions. We analyzed transcripts from SigRdependent sigRp2 and trxBp1 promoters by S1 mapping in various recombinant S. coelicolor strains before and after treatment with 0.5-mM diamide for varying lengths of time. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>B shows representative S1 results, which demonstrate that several homologs behave similarly as ScoRsrA and thus deserve to be called its orthologs.SigR activation as ScoRsrA did. MtuRshA (Rv3221A) was less efficient in sequestering ScoSigR under nonstressed condition, resulting in higher basal-level expression. However, it responded to diamide induction as expected <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. On the other hand, those from Corynebacterium spp. (NCgl0852 and DIP0710) appeared inactive in binding SigR, since the basal-level expression of both sigRp2 and trxBp1 transcripts were constitutively high regardless of diamide treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to assess their redox sensitivity by our analyses. Considering a difference in GC content between Corynebacterium (54%) and S. coelicolor (72%) genomes, there also exist a possibility that not enough corynebacterial ZAS proteins are expressed due to codon bias and other post-transcriptional defects. We quantified S1 results from more than three independent experiments for each recombinant strain, and presented diamide sensitivity of each homolog as fold-induction values compared with the unstressed level (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>). This analysis, therefore, allowed us to identify seven new redox-sensitive ZAS factors, which appear to be functional orthologs of ScoRsrA in binding sigma factor SigR and responding to thiol oxidative stress.</p>
            <p>Multiple sequence alignment of ASDs from nine redoxsensitive and five insensitive ZAS factors reveal residues that are conserved across all ZAS and those that are restricted to redox-sensitive ZAS from actinomycetes <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). In order to delineate broadly functional residues from subfamily-specific residues in a more systematic way, we compared differentially conserved sequence patterns by constructing sequence logos through <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-6">TEXshade</rs> package <ref type="bibr">(34,35)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> demonstrated conserved sequence logo of all 14 ZAS members, and a differentially conserved logo of experimentally validated sensitive ZAS (nos 1-9) and insensitive ZAS (nos <ref type="bibr">10-14)</ref>. Residues around the HCC motif (from K33 to E46 in ScoRsrA) show some differentially conserved pattern in sensitive versus insensitive ZAS proteins. There are also highly conserved residues among sensitive ZAS such as L22, D23, E25, Y48, E51, K55, C62, P68, L71 and R72. However, from sequence gazing, it is not possible to distinguish residues that are conserved across actinomycetes from those that may contribute to redox sensitivity. We therefore proceeded to examine the contribution of the region that surrounds the conserved ZAS motif to determining redox sensitivity.</p>
            <p>We created recombinant proteins by exchanging residues from K33 to K47 in ScoRsrA with the corresponding residues (V26 to H40) in RsiW from B. subtilis <ref type="figure">(Figure 4A)</ref>. The truncated version of RsiW (T-RsiW) that contains only the N-terminal 87 amino acid of ASD without trans-membrane and extracellular domains was modified to make the recombinant. The secondary structure of the swapped product (ST-RsiW) was predicted unchanged by <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-7">Jnet</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(39)</ref>. The recombinant B. subtilis strains that harbor either T-rsiW or ST-rsiW genes in place of the wild-type rsiW were examined to determine whether diamide can induce SigW-specific gene expression. Production of ST-RsiW or T-RsiW was controlled by IPTG <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>, and the amount of auto-regulated sigW transcripts following diamide treatment was examined by S1 mapping. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>B demonstrates that when T-RsiW is induced, sigW expression is drastically reduced, confirming the ability of T-RsiW to bind and sequester SigW. Treatment with diamide did not activate SigW at all, and the sigW gene <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Multiple sequence alignment and sequence logo of ScoRsrA homologs. Mulitple sequence alignment was carried out by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-8">MEGA4</rs>, followed by manual curation. Sequence logos were produced by using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-9">TEXshade</rs>. The secondary structure prediction is based on the structural information of RspChrR (PDB;2Z2S). For alignment, we trimmed both N-terminal and C-terminal residues that extend beyond the ScoRsrA sequence. The nucleotide sequencing identified some sequence differences from the public database, and we used modified sequences for BlinB_010200019545, AAur_2640 and FRAAL6009 (+; Supplementary Table S3). Asterisk indicates entries that contain C-terminal domains in addition to ASD. expression was even lowered compared with the unstressed level. Production of ST-RsiW reduced the sigW gene expression by $60%, indicating some partial binding of SigW by ST-RsiW. When diamide was treated, the expression level increased up to about 4-fold after 40 min of treatment, and then decreased to the basal level at 80 min. This result demonstrates that the HCC region of ScoRsrA conferred redox sensitivity to the insensitive RsiW.</p>

            <p>Calcium imaging . Kidneys were loaded 50 -80 min before recording with the calcium-sensitive dye Oregon Green BAPTA-1 / AM (10 μ M, Molecular Probes ), and perfused with Krebs Ringer Buff er, consisting of, in mM, 100 NaCl, 4 KCl, 20 HEPES, 25 NaHCO 3 , 1 CaCl 2 , 1.2 MgCl 2 , 1 NaH 2 PO 4 · H 2 O, 10 D -glucose, pH 7.35, at 37 ° C. In one protocol, CaCl 2 was excluded and replaced with 250 μ M ethylene glycol bis( β -aminoethylether)-N,N,N ′ , N ′ ,-tetraacetic acid <ref type="figure">( Fig. 1f )</ref>. Intracellular calcium was imaged at 0.5 Hz using an argon laser (488 nm) and LP505 long-pass fi lter on a LSM 510 Zeiss Duo inverted microscope . Image analysis was performed using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="c66a16054a-software-0">ImageJ</rs> ( <rs corresp="#c66a16054a-software-0" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</rs>/ ) and custom-made scripts in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="c66a16054a-software-10">MATLAB</rs> ( <rs corresp="#c66a16054a-software-10" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Th e MathWorks</rs> ). Each calcium trace was normalized using median fi ltered baseline fl uorescence. Low amplitude and high frequency noise were removed from the normalized signal using wavelet transformations (Daubechies 3-d order). In the normalized and fi ltered data, a wave was defi ned as a signal that is 9 % over baseline <ref type="bibr">37</ref>.</p>
            <p>. Here, we show that acute exposure to 10 μ M ouabain, which is the concentration we use for acute treatments, has a negligible eff ect on intracellular sodium concentration <ref type="figure">( Fig. 2e )</ref>. As the on-rate of ouabain exceeds the off -rate <ref type="bibr">18</ref>, eff ective concentrations of ouabain can be considerably reduced when longer exposure times are used. A volume of 10 nM ouabain was added to the culture medium during the last 24 h of culture. A 24 h exposure of rat renal cells to 10 nM ouabain had no eff ect on intracellular sodium concentration <ref type="figure">( Fig. 2f )</ref>. In the proliferation protocol <ref type="figure">( Fig. 3d,e )</ref>, we observed signifi cant eff ects using 1 nM ouabain. Intracellular sodium measurements . Primary cultures of rat proximal tubule cells were prepared as described previously <ref type="bibr">10,39,40</ref>. Th e cells were loaded with 10 μ M SBFI-AM ( Invitrogen ) for 45 min at room temperature, followed by washing and 30 min de-esterifi cation in normal media with 1 mM Probenecid ( Invitrogen ) at 37 ° C. Sodium measurements were taken at 35 ° C in a closed chamber ( FCS3 , Bioptechs ) with a cooled CCD camera ( ORCA-ERG , Hamamatsu ) mounted on an upright microscope ( Axioskop 2 FS , Zeiss ) with a Zeiss Fluar 40 × 1.3 NA oil objective. Excitation at 340 and 380 nm was performed with a monochromator ( Polychrome IV , TILL Photonics ).

Cells were superfused with Krebs-Ringer with 1 mM probenecid. Calibration was performed using perfusion buff er withExpression of Wt1 and Pax2 genes . Total RNA was extracted from a single embryonic kidney using the Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit ( Bio-Rad ) according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations. Relative real-time reverse transcription -PCR was performed according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations for iScript One-Step RT -PCR Kit with SYBR Green ( Bio-Rad ). Quantifi cation was performed in quadruplet for each sample. Commercial 18S Classic II primers ( Ambion ) were used to control genomic DNA contamination, to normalize RNA quality and starting quantity, as well as random tube-to-tube variation in reverse transcription (RT) and PCR reactions. Serial dilution of reference RNA sample as template was used to generate standard curve for each real-time RT -PCR experiment. Th e standard curve was constructed by plotting the log of the starting quantity of total RNA against the C t value. Th e starting quantity of Wt1 and Pax2 mRNA in each test sample was estimated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="c66a16054a-software-3">iQ iCycler</rs> soft ware ( <rs corresp="#c66a16054a-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bio-Rad</rs> ) using values from the standard curve and normalized using 18S RNA as reference. Values are presented as % of control (10 % FBS in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>a,b , 0.2 % FBS in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>c,d ). Rat Wt1 mRNA structure <ref type="bibr">41</ref> (accession number X69716) was used to select Wt1-specifi c primers: upper, 5 ′ -TGCCACACCCCTACCGACAGTT-3 ′ ; lower, 5 ′ -CTTCAAGG-TAGCTCCGAGGTTCATC-3 ′ . Th e position of rat Wt1 primers corresponds to a common part of all Wt1 mRNA splice variants.

            <p>Many sRNAs act on gene expression by base pairing to target mRNAs and influencing either the stability of these targets or the rate of translation or both. To get a hint on possible targets of SorY we compared the transcriptomes of a control strain harbouring an empty vector (2.4.1pBBR) and of the overexpressing strain (2.4.1pBBRSorYi) after 10 min of 1 O 2 stress by microarray analysis <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1)</ref>. From 3976 genes with a reliable A-value 17 protein coding genes showed a log 2 fold change of &gt; 0.6 or &lt; ¡0.6 between the 2 strains <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref>. Putative interaction of the mRNAs transcribed from these genes and SorY were predicted by the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f0bb4d7298-software-simple-0">IntaRNA</rs> tool. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the predicted parameters of genes with expression changes for which an energy value of less than ¡10 kcal/mol was calculated for a putative interaction. The effect of SorY on mRNA levels was confirmed by real time RT-PCR for RSP_2400, RSP_0097, sufC, and adhI <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A)</ref>. The microarray data for flgF could not be confirmed and RSP_0432 was not tested, since no function for this gene is predicted. Real time RT-PCR also demonstrated that deletion of SorY had an opposite effect on the transcript levels of these mRNAs than overexpression of SorY <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2A)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Microarray analysis was performed as described before <ref type="bibr">(Mank et al., 2012)</ref>. Total RNA, obtained from aerobically grown cultures of strains 2.4.1pBBRSorYi and 2.4.1pBBR after 10 min of photooxidative stress, was chemically labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 (Kreatech; EA-022/EA-023), respectively.

On the basis of calculated MA plots, genes were considered reliable if the average signal intensity [A-value: 1/2 log2 (Cy3£Cy5)] was 12. To filter out potentially insignificant changes among genes that passed the reliability criterion, a cutoff value was applied; i.e., those genes were retained whose average expression value of 2.4.1pBBRSorYi (a) compared with the average value of the control treatment 2.4.1pBBR (b) was either a log2 Fold Change of 0.6 or a ¡0.6. Microarray data are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/geo/; accession no. GSE63328).</p>

            <p>All SNPs were tested for significant deviation from HardyWeinberg equilibrium in controls and all passed the test with P-values . 0.05.

Association of the SNPs with disease risk was also corrected by logistic regression using age and sex as covariates and the associations found in this study remain significant after all the corrections. Average ORs and P-values jointly analyzed from both the Hong Kong Chinese and the Thai populations were obtained by CMH test of association conditional on SNP differences between the two populations. Potential heterogeneity of ORs for a given SNP between the two populations was tested both by Breslow -Day test and by partitioning the x 2 statistic between the two populations. Test of independent contribution of a SNP controlling for the effect of other SNPs in the same gene was done by logistic regression as well as haplotype analyses. Association with subphenotype was analyzed by comparing cases with a certain subphenotype with controls, cases without the subphenotype with controls, heterogeneity test of two ORs so derived and direct comparison of the cases with and without the subphenotypes.</p>

In brief, changes to the substrate DNA sequence and the amino acid sequence of the protein were simulated in silico, and the DNA-protein complex was allowed to relax according to an energy function that mimics protein folding.

            <p>Variant T, which contains a K65R substitution, showed a marked increase in binding affinity for both native and +6C/-6C target sites.

These contacts are energetically more favorable than the single contact made by the native K65 residue (À1.22 units for R65 versus À1.09 units for K65; <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="dbc0b63600-software-simple-3">RosettaDesign</rs> analyses not shown).

            <p>Initially, a native dataset was collected and several attempts were made to solve the structure of SceTyrRS by the molecular replacement techniques. The structures of several TyrRSs complexed with or without cognate tRNA Tyr and deposited in the Protein Data Bank, having ca. 10-20% sequence identity with SceTyrRS, were used as search models. Secondly, attempts were made to find good heavy-atom derivatives for phasing by the isomorphous replacement techniques. Since both of these attempts failed, we prepared a Se-Met substituted SceTyrRS using LeMaster medium <ref type="bibr">(47)</ref> and E. coli B834(DE3) cells for phasing by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method. The MAD data collection was performed at beamline 38B1, SPring-8. XAFS measurements were carried out around the selenium K absorption edge using an Se-Met SceTyrRS crystal in a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Subsequently, four datasets were collected from a new single crystal of Se-Met SceTyrRS on and around the selenium K absorption edge at 100 K using an ADSC Quantum-4R CCD detector. All datasets were integrated using the program package DPS <ref type="bibr">(48)</ref>. Scaling and processing were performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e42842aeee-software-simple-0">CCP4</rs> program suite <ref type="bibr">(49)</ref>. Thereafter, a high-resolution dataset was collected from a single crystal of native SceTyrRS at beamline 40B2, SPring-8 ( = 1.00 Å ) in a similar way. The data collection statistics are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p>
            <p>Initial phase calculation was carried out at 3.0-Å resolution using the program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e42842aeee-software-simple-1">SHARP/autoSHARP</rs> <ref type="bibr">(50)</ref>.

            <p>A femoral or jugular venous approach was used for right heart catheterization. Cardiac output and cardiac index were calculated by saturation measurement according to Fick's method. PAP, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and right ventricular and right atrial pressures were measured during breath hold in baseline over at least 3 heart cycles. Mean pulmonary artery pressure was calculated by integration of the pressure curve by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator15" type="software" xml:id="d5e1b7afbc-software-0">Metek</rs> software (<rs corresp="#d5e1b7afbc-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Metek GmbH</rs>, Roetgen, Germany).

Normal distribution was assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results are expressed as meanAESD. A P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. For comparison of invasive and noninvasive measurements of sPAP and RAP, linear regression analyses were conducted and Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated. Bland-Altman analyses were carried for sPAP and RAP measurements to show systematic deviations. For discrimination of sPAP threshold, receiver operating characteristics analysis was conducted. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as accuracy were analyzed for different cut-off values.</p>

            <p>On days 1 and 5, RNA from the incubated hepatocytes in the hybrid systems with different serum concentrations was extracted from the cell lysates by using the TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) suspended in distilled water; later, the RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA. Then, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed, and the products were analyzed by using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and scanned by using a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon 8600 Imager.

The wireless system utilized a specified low-power radio transmission system (429 MHz band), which could be operated without a license in accordance with Japanese Radio Law. The mean variations of the measurements by the glass pH electrode were + 0.20 after 2 months of continuous recording, compared to the values confirmed by a standard pH solution at the start of the recording. The mean lifetime of the internal battery was 3 months when measurements were continuously transmitted every 10 min. There was a good correlation between continuous recording and spot sampling (r = 0.986, P &lt; 0.01), when the ruminal pH recorded by our new system was compared to that of the spot sampling of ruminal fluid <ref type="bibr">(Sato et al. 2012b)</ref>. We have demonstrated the possible application of the radio-transmission pH-measurement system for assessment and monitoring of the ruminal pH in cows. Our new system might contribute to accurate assessment and prevention of SARA. In this chapter, our experimental results of basic tests for performance of radiotransmission pH-measurement system are described.</p>

            <p>The raw ChIP-seq data set <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>, which contains three input samples (Swi6, Tup1 and RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at serine 5 (Pol2ser5p)) and a mock immunoprecipitation (IP) control sample (DMSO, Illumina), was obtained from GEO (data set GSE51251; http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc = GSE51251). We converted the raw sequencing SRA data to FASTQ format using '<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-12">fastq-dump</rs>' version <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-12" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.3.4</rs> in the sequence read archive (<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-5">SRA) Toolkit</rs> <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>.

We filtered the sequencing reads (using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-16">R package 'ShortRead'</rs> (29) version <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-16" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.20.0</rs> with a custom filter) to retain only those with two or less expected errors per read: given a Phred quality score q for each base call, the probability that a base call is erroneous is P = 10 (− q / 10) , which is then summed over the bases in the read to give the expected errors per read. Using '<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-12">ShortRead</rs>' <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>, we deduplicated the reads to control for PCR amplification bias <ref type="bibr">(30,31)</ref> and masked the highly repetitive chromosome XII rDNA region (via a custom filter) because of the difficulty of aligning short reads there. We log 2 -normalized each ChIP-seq sample to the mock IP control using the function get.smoothed.enrichment.mle() in the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-2">R package 'spp'</rs> (32) version <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-2" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.11</rs> with a 200 basepair (bp) bandwidth and 100 bp stepsize.

            <p>We performed a smoothing step to control for the local dependency of the signal in linear genomic space, since we are interested in identifying 3D hotspots of physically proximal yet genomically distal ChIP-seq peaks in subsequent analyses. Specifically, we smoothed each normalized ChIP-seq signal along each chromosome arm using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-17">SuperSmoother</rs> <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref>, which is implemented as supsmu() in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-4">R</rs> (version <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-4" resp="#annotator2" type="version">3.0.2</rs>) package '<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-20">stats</rs>', with the span determined by cross-validation. We then took the residuals of each smoothed normalized signal -this constitutes the final 'ChIP-seq peak height' that we proceeded to superpose onto the 3D genome reconstruction.</p>
            <p>The 3D genome reconstruction consists of a series of beads spaced along each chromosome; each bead has a genomic position and (X,Y,Z) coordinates. For each ChIP-seq input, we binned its peak height data (i.e. the residuals of the smoothed log 2 -normalized signal) such that each bin was centered on a bead. We then assigned to each bead the most extreme ChIP-seq peak height (positive or negative) from the bin centered on that bead. The result is a 3D chromatin configuration reconstruction overlaid with functional genomic data: each bead now has a genomic position, physical coordinates (X,Y,Z) and a ChIP-seq peak height value. We visualized this superposed 3D reconstruction in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-23">MacPy- MOL</rs> <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-23" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.3</rs> (34) by first converting the data to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) file format <ref type="bibr">(35)</ref> with the ChIP-seq peak height value rescaled as the temperature factor (B-factor) in the PDB file.</p>
            <p>We applied <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-23">PRIM</rs> using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-24">R package 'prim'</rs> (36) to discover 3D hotspots in ChIP-seq peak height superposed on the 3D reconstruction. We used the default parameter settings peel alpha = 0.5 and paste alpha = 0.01 (we explored alternative settings subsequently) and used min beads = 25, the smallest parameter setting out of those tested (10, 25, 50 and 100) for which inter-chromosomal hotspots could be detected. After applying PRIM, each bead in the superposed 3D reconstruction now has a genomic position, physical (X,Y,Z) coordinates, a ChIP-seq peak height value and a numerical PRIM box label (the largest numerical label is a placeholder for the beads that were not boxed). We estimated the significance of all of the PRIM boxes (except for the placeholder) by permutations as follows. We preserved the mapping of beads to PRIM boxes, and then permuted the ChIP-seq peak height along each chromosome. Then, we computed the mean ChIP-seq peak height for each PRIM box from the permuted data. We repeated this for a total of 10 5 permutations. The P-value of each box was estimated by comparing its mean ChIP-seq peak height from the observed data to its mean ChIP-seq peak height values from the permuted data. We ranked these potential 3D hotspots by P-value and Holm-adjusted the P-values to account for multiple testing. To gauge the effect size of the mean ChIP-seq peak height of each hotspot, we also computed Z-scores: the difference between the observed mean outcome and the mean of the mean outcomes across all permutations, divided by the standard deviation of the mean outcomes across all permutations.</p>
            <p>We applied k-NN regression to the ChIP-seq peak height superposed on the 3D reconstruction using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-25">R package 'FNN'</rs> <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref>, where k is the specified number of physically proximal beads to be analyzed together as a grouping. First, we selected 'seed' beads evenly spaced along each chromosome by a bead interval of 0.5*k. Next, for each seed bead, we found its k nearest beads in Euclidean distance via the function knn.index() to create a bead grouping. Finally, we found the mean ChIP-seq peak height of each bead grouping via the function knn.reg() and ranked the list of bead groupings by mean ChIP-seq peak height.</p>
            <p>We normalized the S. cerevisiae contact data from <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-26">HiCNorm</rs> (25) (see 'Methods') and then generated a new 3D genome reconstruction from the normalized contact data via the constrained optimization approach from (7) as per <ref type="formula">(17)</ref> (the original study <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> preceded the formalization of pipelines for normalizing Hi-C contact data <ref type="bibr">(25,38- 40)</ref>).</p>

For total carbonyl quantification, equal quantities of proteins were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE 12% (v/v). Chemicals for SDS-PAGE were purchased from BioRad.

To take into account the total amount of loaded protein in each IPG strip, we defined a %vol per carbonylated spot (N%vol) by normalizing the %vol of each anti-DNP incubated membrane with its corresponding %vol on the Fast Green-stationed membrane. The relative modification index ratio (RMI ratio) was obtained by dividing the N%vol of the old group of samples by the N%vol of the young one.</p>

            <p>The following objective approach was used to delineate tracts of interest in this study.

Image artifacts due to eddy currents and bulk head motion were minimized including b-matrix rotation during motion correction <ref type="bibr">(Smith et al., 2004)</ref>. Non-brain tissue was removed <ref type="bibr">(Smith et al., 2002)</ref>. Scalar maps for mean tract FA, MD, AD and RD were generated. Because the component diffusion metrics may provide more specific information about the underling tissue properties they were included in our analysis <ref type="bibr">(Budde et al., 2007; Song et al., 2003)</ref>. For poststroke participants, high-resolution anatomical images were masked to null voxels in the region of their lesion to minimize lesion related structural changes from affecting the registration. Affine (12 degrees-of-freedom) registration was used to obtain transformation matrices first between the diffusion and anatomical space and then between the anatomical and standard space (Montreal NeurologicInstitute 152) <ref type="bibr">(Jenkinson and Smith, 2001)</ref>. Binarized white matter masks <ref type="bibr">(Zhang et al., 2001)</ref> were realigned into diffusion space and used to constrain probabilistic tracking.</p>
            <p>Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity are known to reflect white matter integrity following stroke. Of the two metrics, in our data, MD had the lowest coefficient of variation across the 10 frontoparietal network tracts we quantified in both the poststroke and control groups, therefore it was used for the following three analyses: 1) to explain frontoparietal network variance principal components' analysis (PCA) was conducted on the correlations across the 10-frontoparietal tract mean MD values <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. 2) To evaluate the relationship between haptic performance of the affected hand and network integrity we examined the relationship between ipsilesional and interhemispheric tract MD and HASTe scores using Pearson correlation coefficient. Bonferroni correction for 6 comparisons resulted in an adjusted alpha of p b 0.008 <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. 3) To evaluate how well frontoparietal white matter integrity and other variables (age, brain volume and lesion volume) predicted HASTe scores of the affected and less affected hand we used forward stepwise multiple regression.

            <p>After ultrasound sonication for ~1 minute in the presence of MBs, 6,7 the rat was immediately placed under the objective of the two-photon microscope. The syringe was replaced by the one filled with TRITC-dextran-155 kDa solution (tracer) <ref type="figure">(Figure 3B)</ref>. The tracer solution was then introduced into the cerebral circulation via the carotid artery at a constant flow rate of ~3 mL/min <ref type="bibr">23,36</ref> for 1 minute in an interval of 5 minutes. Simultaneously, the images of the ROI containing the microvessels and the surrounding brain tissue were captured for 1 minute at 5-minute intervals up to 25 minutes. The images of 239 μm ×239 μmThe MBs at a concentration of ~1.7×10 6 bubbles/mL were injected via rat carotid artery at a constant speed of ~3 mL/min, the normal blood flow velocity at the carotid artery; after 10-15 seconds, the MBs reach the microvascular bed ~100-200 μm below the pia mater, <ref type="bibr">23</ref> and the FUS sonication was administrated for 1 minute. After sonication, the rat head was mounted into the multiphoton microscope, and the ROI with cerebral microvessels was found. This took about 5 minutes. Then, the images for determining the BBB solute permeability were collected for 1 minute at a rate of one image per second in a 5-minute interval, up to 25 minutes.We used the similar method as in our previous study for permeability of pial microvessels <ref type="bibr">24</ref> to determine permeability of cerebral microvessels ~100-200 μm below the pia mater. Most of the microvessels chosen were post-capillary venules of 15-40 μm diameter for the permeability measurement, and around 1/4 of the microvessels were capillaries. <ref type="bibr">24,35</ref> The reasons that we currently only measured the permeability of post-capillary venules and capillaries were: 1) to avoid the influence of smooth muscle cells at arteries, arterioles, and large venules, which would contract under stimuli and affect the permeability measurement; <ref type="bibr">35</ref> 2) our previous studies on the BBB permeability were also conducted on this type of post-capillary venules. <ref type="bibr">23,24</ref> The permeability was determined off-line from the pre-collected images by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="b927e5064e-software-0">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#b927e5064e-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, MD, USA). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>A shows a typical image of an ROI (~239 μm ×239 μm) with a couple of microvessels and surrounding brain tissue.

The measuring window was ~50-100 μm long and ~30-60 μm wide and was set at least 10 μm from the base of the bifurcation to avoid solute contamination from the side arms.

            <p>Demographic data (age and sex), the presence of LSTV in the radiographic images and its type was recorded in all the 3 groups. Among the patients in group B who also had an MRI, disc degeneration was assessed by Pfirrmann's grading system <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref> <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Similar grading of disc degeneration was done in group C at the non herniated levels, i.e., if M1 was the herniated level, Pfirrmann's grading was assigned to the discs at the M2 and M3levels. Based on this system, degeneration was graded as 'normal' (Pfirrmann's grade I), 'mild' (Pfirrmann's grade II) and 'advanced' (grades III-V). This was based on Lam et al. <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>'s findings of a positive provocative discography in 0%, 9%, and 71% of patients with Pfirrmann's grades I, II, III respectively and 100% in patients with Pfirrmann's grade IV and V. Lam et al. <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> stated that Pfirrmann's grading correlated strongly with the clinical symptoms. Radiological images of 1,000 consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria were selected for each group retrospectively from the hospital's OPD and operation records. The sample size of 3,000 was calculated from a similar study by Kong et al. <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, in which they found no significant difference between the LSTV and non-LSTV groups in degenerative spondylolisthesis patients, with a p-value of 0.8 and a sample size of 78, using "the N master software. " In order to maintain consistency and avoid inter-observer variability, all the observations, classifications and grading were done by a single qualified spinal surgeon. The study was conducted in a major tertiary care centre with a daily OPD input of 6,000 patients including all specialities. The chi-square and proportion tests were used to compare 2 sets of variables and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was done using 'The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="bd68074248-software-simple-0">R</rs> statistical software' by a qualified statistician. Probability and relative risks were also calculated using the same software.</p>

            <p>18 F]-fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl)-guanine. 9-(4-[ 18 F]-fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl)-guanine ([ 18 F]FHBG) was synthesized by a modification of the method of Ponde et al. <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref> as previously described <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>. Micropositron emission tomography. A PET reporter gene (PRG)/PET reporter probe (PRP) system was used, as previously described <ref type="bibr">(20,24,25)</ref>. HSV1-sr39tk was expressed in islets as described above. The probe, <ref type="bibr">[</ref> 18 F]F-HBG, was systemically administered and its retention in islets, after phosphorylation by rAD-TK, was quantified by micropositron emission tomography (microPET) imaging. Transplanted mice were scanned using a Focus120 (CTI Concorde) system that yielded 63 slices, 1.2 mm apart with an in-plane resolution of 2 mm full-width at half-maximum <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. Image reconstruction and data analysis were performed as previously described <ref type="bibr">(20,24,25)</ref>. Insulitis scoring and measurement of relative ␤-cell area. Paraffinembedded pancreatic sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E), and islets were examined in a blinded manner under the microscope to evaluate the degree of mononuclear cell infiltration. The degree of insulitis was scored in the following five categories: 0, intact islet; Ͻ25% of the islet infiltrated; 25-50% of the islet infiltrated; 50 -75% of the islet infiltrated; andϾ75% of the islet infiltrated. The degree of insulitis in 20 -25 islets per mouse was evaluated. ␤-Cell area was measured on the sections of each pancreas stained for insulin. Morphometric evaluation of the total ␤-cell area was performed by computer-assisted image analysis (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="b5427b7954-software-0">Northern Eclipse</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#b5427b7954-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">6</rs>) using light and immunofluorescence microscopy. The area of insulin-positive cells and the total area of the tissue section were evaluated for each section, and the percentage ␤-cell area was calculated by the ratio of the area occupied by insulin-positive cells to the total pancreatic area.</p>
            <p>ϩ T-cells was confirmed by flow cytometry. Migration assay. <ref type="bibr">CD4</ref> ϩ T-cells were plated on membrane inserts (8-m pore size) in serum-free RPMI 1640, and cell migration was assayed using Transwell chambers (Corning), in the presence or absence of purified porcine kidney DPP-IV (32.1 units/mg; 100 mU/ml final concentration; provided by Dr. Hans-Ulrich Demuth, Probiodrug, Halle, Germany) (28) Ϯ DPP-IV inhibitor (100 mol/l). After 1 h, cells on the upper surface were removed mechanically, and cells that had migrated into the lower compartment were counted. The extent of migration was then expressed relative to the control sample. Rac1 guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding assay. Total cellular extracts were isolated from CD4 ϩ T-cells and Rac1 GTP binding assays performed using the fluorophore-based RhoGEF exchange assay kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO), and data were normalized to protein concentration. cAMP measurements. <ref type="bibr">CD4</ref> ϩ T-cells were incubated for 30 min with GIP, 100 nmol/l GLP-1 or 100 mU/ml purified porcine DPP-IV in the presence of 0.5 mmol/l IBMX. cAMP concentration in the cell extracts was determined using the Parameter cyclic AMP assay kit (R&amp;D Systems). Protein kinase A activity assay. Activity was measured using a protein kinase A (PKA) kinase activity assay kit (Stressgen, Mississauga, ON) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The enzyme activity was normalized to protein concentration, and data are shown as the relative activity to control. Western blot analysis. Total cellular extracts were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad). Probing of the membranes was performed with antibodies to phosphop38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (threonine-180/tyrosine-182), p38 MAPK, phospho-p42/44 MAPK (threonine-202/tyrosine-204), p42/44 MAPK, phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) (threonine-183/tyrosine-185), phospho-protein kinase B (PKB) (serine-473), phospho-PKB (threonine-308), PKB, and ␤-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA).

            <p>Quantitative coronary angiography was performed using standard quantitative analyses and definitions. <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> A main principle of our QCA approach was to ensure as little observer interference as possible. Angiograms obtained at baseline and before MV stenting were analyzed with the use of a computer-based system dedicated to bifurcation analysis (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dc54f3b199-software-0">Qangio XA</rs>, version <rs corresp="#dc54f3b199-software-0" resp="#curator" type="version">7.3</rs>, <rs corresp="#dc54f3b199-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Medis</rs>, Leiden, the Netherlands). We obtained quantitative angiographic measurements of the four segments of the bifurcation lesion: The proximal MV segment, the distal MV segment, the SB segment and the bifurcation core segment <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>]. Bifurcation core is defined as the central part of the bifurcation which begins where the common vessel starts to split into two branches and ends at the carinal point, <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> which area was calculated by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dc54f3b199-software-simple-3">Qangio XA</rs> software. We also obtained the bifurcation angle (the angle between the distal MV and the SB) from the analysis system.</p>
            <p>Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of SB occlusion. The covariates that were either statistically significant on univariate analysis (P &lt; 0.25) or considered important were included in the multivariate model. Totally, 28 covariates were employed in the multivariate model, including diabetes, previous PCI, medina classification, plaque location,reference diameter of the proximal and distal MV, reference diameter of the SB, preprocedural percent diameter stenosis of the proximal MV, preprocedural percent diameter stenosis of the distal MV, true bifurcation lesions, lesion length of the MV and SB, bifurcation angle, predilation of the SB and jailed wire in SB. Estimates of the adjusted differences in risks are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the difference. All P values were two-tailed, and a P &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic, defined as the proportion of total variation observed between the trials attributable to differences between trials rather than sampling error (chance), with values &lt;25% considered as low and &gt;75% as high. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The pooled effect for each grouping of trials was derived from the point estimate for each separate trial weighted by the inverse of the variance (1/SE 2 ). Continuous variable outcomes (PRU, per cent platelet inhibition) between the groups were compared with both a fixed effect model using the inverse variance method and a random effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird method. For cardiovascular outcomes, rates were expressed per patient-years to adjust for the varying duration of follow-up. Results were therefore reported as incident rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs with the use of both a fixed effect model using the method of Mantel and Haenszel and a random effects model using the method of DerSimonian and Laird, with the estimate of heterogeneity being taken from the Mantel-Haenszel model. Publication bias was estimated using the weighted regression tests of Begg and Egger. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> For platelet reactivity indices, analyses were stratified based on whether standard-dose (75 mg) or high-dose (150 mg) clopidogrel was used in the DAPT arm. In addition, further sensitivity analyses were performed based on the cohort enrolled: (1) acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus not; and (2) enrolment of patients with HTPR at baseline versus not. For cardiovascular outcomes, analyses were stratified based on stent typedrug eluting stent (DES) versus Bare metal stent (BMS). A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p>

            <p>The cell cycle, circadian clock and relative phase. Recent studies have shown that the circadian clock is coupled to the cell cycle processes through clockcontrolled genes, which may contain E-box or ROR elements in their promoters. Somewhat surprisingly, although we found that deregulation of PER2 has a strong effect on the induced transformation of MEFs and tumorigenesis; the gene expression changes in these clock-controlled genes are less profound in Per2 allele mutant MEFs. This leads us to think about their phase implication. Although the Nr1d1 transcripts displayed obvious phase shift and period length changes in these mutant MEFS, p21 transcripts displayed fixed 24-h-period oscillation with phase delay to the same extent, leading to a similar phase to that of Cyclin D. It indicates that in the wide-type MEFs, the opposite phases of p21 and Cyclin D are a result of coordination between circadian clock and cell cycle, with circadian clock adjusting transcription phase of p21 and the main driver of cell cycle. With the interaction of PER2, NR1D1 may be a critical circadian factor in exerting the phase adjusting function. At present, the physiological significance of the altered phases of these genes is unclear, and the phase shifting cannot explain all the phenotypes that are seen in these mutant mice. It is likely that modifier relative phases between the cycle genes influence features such as the number of transformation foci and the development of the tumor-associated fibroblasts. One of the possibilities comes from interfering with phase locking. Oscillation-based synchrony is the most energyefficient physical mechanism for temporal coordination. It occurs in many biological systems, including two oscillators of cell division and the circadian phase <ref type="bibr">31</ref> or within a cell cycle oscillator through multiple regulatory interactions. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> mutants 33 by crossing with p53 R175H/ þ mice.

            <p>Fragment-based tools such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-0">SuperLooper</rs> depend on databases too large to distribute as stand-alone programs (∼80 GB in the case of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-1">SL2</rs>). The rapid delivery of a large number of possible loop conformation makes web-based tools a perfect candidate. The database remains on a server and the user is able to choose a suitable loop from listed results using a web-based molecule viewer. Here, we use <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-2">NGL</rs> <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref> for protein and fragment visualization, which adopts capabilities of modern web browsers, such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-3">WebGL</rs> for molecular graphics. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-4">NGL</rs> allows interactive display of even large molecular complexes and is unaffected by the retirement of third-party plug-ins such as Flash or Java-Applets. This viewer offers comprehensive molecular visualization through a graphical user interface so that life scientists can easily access and utilize available structural data without any further installations <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Thus, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-5">SL2</rs> benefits from the significantly enlarged database of fragments and new fast molecule viewer. Due to the improved coverage of the conformational loop space, the quality of prediction, measured by the backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD), has improved by 20% on average compared to our previous version <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. The new version of our fragment-based web-application for loop modeling <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-6">SL2</rs> thus has an improved performance in loop prediction as well as an up-to-date visualization.</p>
            <p>Geometrical fingerprint matching is used as a criterion to estimate the sterical fit of stem atoms of N-and C-termini of each database fragment to the C-and N-terminal stem atoms of a gap in a protein structure. The geometrical fingerprints of both the stem atoms of each database fragment and the stem atoms of the gap are composed of the distance between the N-and C-terminal stem atoms and three angles defining their relative orientation <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Compared to our previous version, we slightly altered the geometric fingerprint. Previously, we used a combination of two distances and two angles for scoring, resulting in a higher weighting of the fit of the residue where the angle was measured. In <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-7">SL2</rs>, we solved this problem employing distance and three angles.</p>
            <p>Since the first release of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-14">SuperLooper</rs> in <rs corresp="#aca211c246-software-14" resp="#annotator8" type="version">2008</rs>, the number of entries deposited in the RSCB PDB has more than doubled from 54 543 structures to 114 693 in 2015. A total of 901 609 231 fragments with a length of 3 to 35 residues was extracted from this enlarged pool of template structures <ref type="figure">(Figure 2A)</ref>. Because more short than long overlapping fragments are extracted from a given template structure,mented that automatically adds novel fragments to the LIP or LIMP database every three months.</p>
            <p>Due to (partial) embedding into the lipid bilayer, loops of membrane proteins have a more hydrophobic amino acid composition compared to loops of globular proteins <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>. Tools developed for the prediction of loops connecting transmembrane helices were indeed found to enhance prediction of GPCR loops <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. In <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-10">SL2</rs>, such loops can be selected from LIMP, which is a collection of fragments extracted from loops of all helical transmembrane proteins. Loops were defined as parts without regular fold, thus also containing kinks, bulges or re-entrant loops <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. To allow selection of membrane protein loops taking the lipid bilayer into account, the extension of the lipid bilayer is indicated by two parallel planes (as described below).</p>
            <p>For visual inspection of results, we employed the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-11">NGL viewer</rs> which works without installation of additional plugins <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. As a common graphical user interface for the<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-12">NGL viewer</rs> <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>) the search mask and the results list were implemented within JavaScript. A protein structure uploaded via the file selection dialog is instantly loaded to the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-13">NGL viewer</rs>.

The sequence of the missing segment must be typed or copied into the search mask. If the membrane protein-specific LIMP data base (Membrane DB) is not checked, the LIP data base will be searched. After the submission button is pressed, the search is started. Depending on the loop length, results are expected to appear after few seconds or up to half a minute in the results list.</p>
            <p>Visualization is carried out by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-15">NGL viewer</rs> <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. To use the full feature set of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-16">NGL viewer</rs> an up-to-date web browser (tested on the recent versions of <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-17">Firefox</rs>, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-18">Google Chrome</rs>, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-19">Safari</rs>, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-20">IE</rs> and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-21">Edge</rs>) is recommended. The specialized graphical user interface is written in JavaScript. For job handling a simple python job server based on the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-1">Flask</rs> framework (<rs corresp="#aca211c246-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">http://flask.pocoo.org/</rs>) is used.</p>
            <p>The updated version of our fragment based web-application tool for loop modeling, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-24">SL2</rs>, benefits from an enlarged fragment database and a new user interface including an updated protein viewer. As a result of the enlarged fragment database the prediction quality has been further improved. Using the same dataset <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref> and validation procedure as in our previous publication <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>, an average gain in prediction quality by 20% is observed for loops of 3-16 residues length <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref>. A drop of the backbone RMSD between experimentally determined and modeled loops (only the top hit was considered) starts to become evident for loops with eight residues length. This implies that the coverage of possible loop conformations has been further optimized starting with this length.</p>
            <p>Despite the gain of prediction quality, the top hit results obtained by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-25">SL2</rs> sometimes deviate from the experimentally determined structure even for short loops. There are several Nucleic Acids Research, 2016, Vol. 44, Web Server issue W393possible reasons for this. First, many loops are highly flexible or are even located in structurally disordered regions of proteins <ref type="bibr">(26,27)</ref>. The conformations suggested by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="aca211c246-software-simple-26">SL2</rs> may thus indicate alternative loop conformations not observed by protein X-ray structure crystallography (e.g. <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref> in <ref type="formula">(28)</ref>). Second, as scoring of the loops mainly depends on the stem residues, experimentally caused distortions of these stem atoms may prevent selection of a specific conformation <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>. Prediction quality drops with loop length, mainly due to the increased conformational space. A promising strategy to enhance prediction quality of longer loops would be inclusion of additional experimental constraints such as mass spectrometry <ref type="bibr">(30,31)</ref> or electron density maps from single particle cryo-electron microscopy <ref type="bibr">(32)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Lactobacillus strain collection and MALDI-TOF spectra database. The Lactobacillus strain collection of our laboratory has been completed by the strains from the Pasteur and DSMZ collections, and reference spectra have been created from those missing in the Bruker database. Bacterial identification was undertaken with an Autoflex II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH). Data were automatically acquired using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="aae85e7424-software-0">Flex control</rs> <rs corresp="#aae85e7424-software-0" resp="#annotator6" type="version">3.0</rs> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="aae85e7424-software-1">Maldi Biotyper Automation Control</rs> <rs corresp="#aae85e7424-software-1" resp="#annotator6" type="version">2.0</rs>. (<rs corresp="#aae85e7424-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bruker Daltonics GmbH</rs>). Raw spectra, obtained for each isolate, were analyzed by standard pattern matching (with default parameter settings) against the spectra of species used as a reference database. An isolate was regarded as correctly identified at the species level when at least one spectrum had a score X1.9, and one spectrum had a score X1.7. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> The reproducibility of the method was evaluated by the duplicate analysis of 10 samples.</p>
            <p>First, the results of Lactobacillus-specific culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were compared in the two groups (obese and control group) using the Fisher's exact test when comparing proportions, and the Mann-Whitney test when comparing bacterial concentrations. A difference was considered statistically significant when Po0.05. In order to identify which qPCR bacterial groups (Bacteroidetes, B. animalis, Lactococcus lactis, L. acidophilus, L. casei/paracasei, L. fermentum, L. gasseri, L. plantarum, L. reuteri, L. rhamnosus) was most associated with the likelihood of being obese while taking into account possible confounders like age or gender, a logistic regression model was used. Variables with a liberal Po0.20 in the univariate logistic regression analysis were considered eligible for the multiple logistic regression analyses. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> A secondary analysis based on logistic regression analysis was used to identify which culture variables (Lactobacillus species concentration) where associated with obesity.

            <p>Live confocal imaging Embryos were electroporated with 0.75 mM ContMO or Sip1MO (FITC labeled) + 1.5 mg/ml membrane RFP and/or nuclear RFP. They were imaged in the Lab-Tek chambered 1.0 borosilicate coverage glass system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with &lt;0.5 ml 0.6% low-melt agarose mixed with Ringer's solution. Embryos were maintained at 37°C during imaging. A confocal microscope (LSM 510 Meta or LSM 710; Carl Zeiss) was used with an LD C-Apochromat 40×/1.1 W Corr objective (Carl Zeiss). Time lapses were done with a z total = 31 µm to leave space for z-drift. Time points were collected at 5-min intervals. Subsets in the z-plane containing the cells of interest were selected for clarity. Collected time-lapse data were registered using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ba67264558-software-0">Imaris</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ba67264558-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bitplane</rs>) to account for embryo drift and exported as TIF images and MOV videos. The registration correction (processed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ba67264558-software-simple-2">Imaris</rs> software) for embryo drift results in the changes in movie shapes seen here. Cell tracking in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ba67264558-software-simple-3">Imaris</rs> was done in the FITC (green) channel. Parameters used included a spot diameter of 5.19 µm and the "Connected Components" algorithm for tracking.</p>

            <p>Cell adhesion assay: To confirm the selectivity and specificity of the association between integrins and ECM ligands, a cell adhesion assay was performed using primary human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs; Cell Systems, Kirkland, WA). Briefly, 75 μl vitronectin (5 μg/ml; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or fibronectin (10 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich; concentrations showing best adhesion to HRECs) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 96-well microtiter plates. After excess ECM was removed from the wells, the uncoated area in the wells was blocked with 1% BSA. HRECs suspended at 10 5 cells per ml in CSC medium (Cell Systems) containing 0.1% BSA were incubated for 30 min with antibodies for α5β1 (clone JBS5, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) or αvβ3 (LM609, Millipore). Ten-microliter cell suspensions were inoculated into the ECM-coated wells. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the cells were fixed with 10% neutral formalin (Nacalai tesque) and stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution (Sigma-Aldrich).

            <p>All animal procedures were approved by a local Animal Ethics Committee and in accordance with guidelines set out in the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (7th Ed). Male C57Bl/6 mice at 12 weeks of age were subjected to open-chest surgery for coronary artery occlusion (CAO) for a period of 15 or 60 minutes, respectively (n=19 per group) or for sham procedure (n=6 per group) as we previously described. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Quantification of the myocardium-at-risk and infarct myocardium Myocardium-at-risk and infarct myocardium were identified as described previously with minor modifications. <ref type="bibr">16,25</ref> Briefly, after cannulation of the ascending aorta, 5% Evans blue was injected into coronary arteries to stain nonischemic myocardium. The LV was then harvested and sectioned into 5 to 7 slices at a thickness of 0.7 mm from the apex to the base and then incubated in 1.5% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC in PBS, 30 minutes at 37°C). The nonischemic zone (blue area), myocardium-at-risk (nonstained area by Evans blue), and infarct zone (nonstained area by TTC) were outlined and areas quantified digitally using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0519e7a6b-software-simple-0">Image J</rs> software. Since LV sections were at an equal thickness of 0.7 mm, volumes of myocardium-at-risk and infarct myocardium were also calculated by multiplying differently stained areas of each LV section with 0.7 mm, and expressed as mm 3 per heart. The size of infarct or myocardium-at-risk was expressed aspercentage of the LV.</p>
            <p>Cardiac resonance magnetic (CMR) examination post-MI was completed in all 42 patients of the Melbourne cohort at day 3 and in 36 patients at 3 months using a clinical 1.5-T CMR scanner (Sigma HDx 1.5-T, GE Healthcare) following the method previously described. <ref type="bibr">26,28</ref> Briefly, LV function was assessed by a standard steady state free precession technique called Fast Imaging Employing Steady State Acquisition (FIESTA). LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated by volumetric analysis from a contiguous short axis FIESTA stack covering the LV and right ventricle using the summation of disc method 29 by 2 cardiologists. For determination of myocardium-at-risk, LV short-axis slices covering the whole LV using a T2-weighted triple-inversion recovery breathhold fast spinecho pulse sequence were obtained using a body coil. Myocardium-at-risk was quantified by manual delineation of myocardium with bright signal intensity 2 SD above the mean signal obtained in the remote, noninfarct myocardium and multiplying the slice thickness and the myocardial density of 1.05 g/mL, expressed as a percentage of LV mass. Late enhancement images covering the whole LV were acquired %15 minutes after intravenous administration of a bolus of gadolinium-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) to identify regional necrosis/fibrosis for infarct size quantification using an inversion recovery gradient echo technique. The area of hyperenhanced myocardium (bounded by endocardial and epicardial contours) on each of the shortaxis slice was manually traced then multiplied by the slice thickness and the myocardial density of 1.05 g/mL to obtain the infarct mass, and expressed as a percentage of LV mass (infarct size). <ref type="bibr">30</ref> All analyses were performed offline on dedicated workstations running <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0519e7a6b-software-1">AW SDC</rs> <rs corresp="#e0519e7a6b-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">4.4</rs> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0519e7a6b-software-2">IDL</rs> version<rs corresp="#e0519e7a6b-software-2" resp="#annotator3" type="version">6.3</rs> with <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0519e7a6b-software-3">ReportCARD</rs> version <rs corresp="#e0519e7a6b-software-3" resp="#annotator3" type="version">3.6</rs> by fully blinded observers with excellent reproducibility (r=0.98) for infarct size assessment.</p>
            <p>For clinical studies, categorical data are presented as numbers and percentages. Continuous data are presented as meanAESD. All continuous variables were subjected to D'Agostino &amp; Pearson omnibus or the 1-sample KolmogorovSmirnov normality test. If variables failed to pass the test, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to detect significance among groups with Dunns post-hoc test, and Spearman correlation was performed to detect the correlation between parameters. If variables passed the test, Pearson correlation or standard linear regression was performed to detect the correlation and continuous variables were compared with either unpaired Student's t test or 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Newman-Keuls post-hoc test. When multiple independent terms were included in regression analyses, stepped entry and removal was used with p for inclusion (PIN) and p for removal (POUT) set at 0.05 and 0.1, respectively. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

While the MiniMed Paradigm Veo LGS and the MiniMed 530G TS features differ in suspend threshold range, they are considered functionally equivalent. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For simplicity, the threshold suspend features in all three systems have been referred to as ''suspend on low''. Pump suspension events were characterized according to whether insulin delivery was resumed automatically or manually. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were defined as SG values £70 mg/dL (£3.9 mmol/L) and 240-300 mg/dL (13.3-16.7 mmol/L), respectively, and were compared across systems using a Kruskal-Wallis analysis. Severe hyperglycemia was defined as ‡300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L). Hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic excursions were defined as ‡2 consecutive hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic SG values per day or night (8:00 PM-8:00 AM) and, in addition to area under the glucose concentration-time curve (AUC), were compared between the MiniMed Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 640G systems using a Wilcoxon signed-rank analysis.</p>
            <p>This study benefits from the large number of users and user-days available for analyses, although data from system users who did not upload to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="e21e522056-software-simple-3">CareLink</rs> software were unavailable. A limitation of the study is that the MiniMed 640G ''suspend on low'' versus MiniMed 640G ''suspend before low'' data could not be analyzed, due to an insufficient number of events during use of the former feature. The lack of detailed user demographic information is another limitation, as is a lack of detailed information regarding user-system interface (e.g., calibrations, sensor changes, and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e21e522056-software-simple-4">CareLink</rs> software upload frequency), physician-touser instructions, and dietary and exercise behaviors. The false-positive rate of predictive pump suspensions, as well as sensor accuracy, could not be assessed because of the study's retrospective nature. The effect of sensor life on the rate of pump suspension events was also not possible to assess. Within-user comparisons of MiniMed Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 640G system use may have been influenced by the unidirectional nature of the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system use preceding MiniMed 640G system use, and by uncharacterized or unknown behaviors related to becoming familiar with a new pump system.</p>

            <p>1. Design oligos for the plasmid backbone (subcloning plasmid) and the selectable marker (insertion cassette). Design each oligo such that it contains 180 bp HA flanking the genomic target site and 20 bp of specific priming sequence of the insertion cassette or the subcloning plasmid <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref>. NOTE: Homology arms should not contain any repetitive elements, presence of repetitive elements will result in incorrect targeting and subcloning. Repetitive elements can be detected by using web based tools such as the ''Repeat Masker''. 2. Include a unique restriction enzyme (RE) site on one of the vector oligos to linearize the gene targeting vector for ES cell targeting <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). 3. Check oligo parameters using an <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="e38be96101-software-simple-0">oligo analyzer</rs> program. Take care to avoid secondary structures in the priming regions. 4. Shorter HA (50 bp) of the insertion cassette is tolerated and yields lower number of recombinants but ensure that the subcloning plasmid HA is always longer (180 bp). 5. Determine the orientation of the genomic DNA insert of the particular BAC clone using web based tools like ''<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="e38be96101-software-simple-1">cloneDB</rs>''. Establish the direction of replication from OriS by checking the map of the BAC plasmid backbone used in the BAC library construction. NOTE: OriS is usually opposite to the transcriptional direction of the Chloramphenicol (Chl) marker for all commonly used BAC plasmids. 6. Add two terminal phosphorothioate (PTO) bonds to the 5' end of the oligo that is opposite to the direction of replication on the BAC clone. Add a 5' phosphate modification to the reverse oligo <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref></p>

            <p>The logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for men and women for NAFLD as an outcome. The potential predictors that were used in the analyses were: age, marriage (married vs. unmarried), residency (rural vs. urban), smoking (smoking vs. non-smoking), obesity (obese vs. non-obese), blood pressure (high BP vs. low), triglyceride (high TG vs. low), and high-density lipoprotein (low HDL vs. high). The obesity, high BP, high TG, and low HDL were defined based on a joint interim statement definition of MetS <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. The Wald test, significant levels, and odd ratios (OR) were reported. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for the logistic regressions. All statistical analyses were conducted using statistical software (<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a07cded56d-software-0">SPSS</rs> Inc., version <rs corresp="#a07cded56d-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">21</rs>, Chicago, IL and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a07cded56d-software-1">Stata</rs> software, version <rs corresp="#a07cded56d-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">12</rs>, <rs corresp="#a07cded56d-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">StataCorp</rs>, Texas, US). The significant levels in all analyses were considered to be 0.05. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the basic characteristics of the study population based on residency. While the rural people had a higher WC, SBP, AST, FBS, HDL, and HOMA, the urban people had a higher DBP. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the basic characteristics of the study population based on marriage status. Based on our results, married people had a higher mean age, WC, DBP, GGT, ALT, FBS, and TG, but a lower HDL than unmarried people did. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the results of the univariate and multivariate binary logistic regressions. In these analyses, the NAFLD was considered to be the outcome variable. NAFLD had a direct association with marriage status in men (OR = 2.770 (2.004 -3.831), P value &lt; 0.001) and women (OR = 1.241 (1.033 -1.490), P value = 0.0209), and an inverse association with living in rural areas for men (OR = 0.513 (0.422 -0.622), P value &lt; 0.001) and women (OR = 0.431 (0.345 -0.539), P value &lt; 0.001).</p>
