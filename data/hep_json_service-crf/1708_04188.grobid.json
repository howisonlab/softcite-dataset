            "text": ". The DNNs utilise a parameterised machine learning technique [74] in order to ensure optimal sensitivity on the full range of signal hypotheses considered in these searches. In this approach, one or more physics parameters describing the wider scope of the problem, as for example the mass of the resonance in the resonant search case, are provided as input to the DNNs, in addition to reconstructed quantities. The parameterised network is able to perform as well as individual networks trained on specific hypotheses (parameter values) while requiring only a single training, and provides a smooth interpolation to cases not seen during the training phase, as shown by figure 3. Two parameterised DNNs are trained: one for the resonant and one for the nonresonant search. In the first case, the set of parameters are the masses of the resonance, providing 13 values for the network training (m X = 260, 270, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 750, 800, 900 GeV), and a discrete variable indicating the dilepton flavour channel: same flavour (e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) or different flavour (e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 ). In the second case, the parameters are \u03ba \u03bb and \u03ba t , providing 32 combinations of those for the network training (\u03ba \u03bb = \u221220, -5, 0, 1, 2.4, 3.8, 5, 20 and \u03ba t = 0.5, 1, 1.75, 2.5), and the dilepton flavour channel variable as in the resonant case.",
