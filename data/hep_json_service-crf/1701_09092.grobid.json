If the lattice spacing is much smaller than the size of a hadron (\u223c 1 fm) this approximation allows (computer-intensive) calculations of hadron masses in terms of one parameter (a scale with dimension \"mass\"). Usually this is done with different lattice spacings a s and extrapolated to a s = 0. Recent developments [12] predict the lightest glueballs to have M G (0 ++ ) = 1710 MeV and M G (2 ++ ) = 2390 MeV, with uncertainties of about 100 MeV and 125 MeV respectively.
