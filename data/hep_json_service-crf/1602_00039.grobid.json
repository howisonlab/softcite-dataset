Drawing on the experience from the Rochester-Brookhaven-Fermilab (RBF) and the University of Florida (UF) searches, the ADMX collaboration designed an experiment with the goal to reach KSVZ axions saturating our galactic halo, whose local density would be \u03c1a \u223c 0.45 GeV/cm 3 . This goal would be achieved both by a scale-up of the cavity volume by two orders of magnitude, and profiting from the steady improvement in the noise temperature of commercial HFET amplifiers.",
