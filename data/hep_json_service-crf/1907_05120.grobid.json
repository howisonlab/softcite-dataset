This demonstrates the advantage of combining the information provided by the low-level taggers, where improvements in the lightflavour jet and c-jet rejections by factors of around 10 and 2.5, respectively, are observed at the b = 70% single-cut OP of the high-level algorithms compared to low-level algorithms. This figure also illustrates the different b-jet tagging efficiency range accessible with each low-level algorithm and thereby their complementarity in the multivariate combinations, with the performance of the DL1 and MV2 discriminants found to be similar. The two algorithms tag a highly correlated sample of b-jets, where the relative fraction of jet exclusively tagged by each algorithm is around 3% at the \u03b5 b = 70% single-cut OP. The relative fractions of lightflavour jets exclusively mis-tagged by the MV2 or the DL1 algorithms at the \u03b5 b = 70% single-cut OP reach 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.",

All are openly available, without restriction on use by external parties beyond copyright law and the standard conditions agreed by CERN. Data associated with journal publications are also made available: tables and data from plots (e.g. cross section values, likelihood profiles, selection efficiencies, cross section limits, ...) are stored in appropriate repositories such as HEPDATA (http:// hepdata.cedar.ac.uk/). ATLAS also strives to make additional material related to the paper available that allows a reinterpretation of the data in the context of new theoretical models. For example, an extended encapsulation of the analysis is often provided for measurements in the framework of RIVET (http://rivet.hepforge.org/). This information is taken from the ATLAS Data Access Policy, which is a public document that can be downloaded from http://opendata.cern.ch/record/413 [opendata.cern.ch].",
