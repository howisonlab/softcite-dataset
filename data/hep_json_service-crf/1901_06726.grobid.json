The test statistic is q \u03bc = \u22122 ln L \u03bc /L max , where L max is the maximum likelihood determined by leaving all parameters as free, including the signal strength, and L \u03bc is the maximum likelihood for a fixed value of \u03bc. Limits are determined   Table 1. The lower panel shows the ratio of the observed events to the predicted SM background events. The error bars in the lower panel are the quadrature sum of the statistical uncertainty in the observed data and the systematic uncertainty in the predicted backgrounds before the adjustments based on a maximum likelihood fit to data assuming no signal strength using an approximation of the asymptotic form of the test statistic distribution [69] in conjunction with the CL s criterion [70,71].
