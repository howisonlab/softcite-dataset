But to have a new idea is a very difficult task: it does not mean to write a few lines in a paper. If you want to be the father of a new idea, you should fully devote your intellectual energy to understand all details and to work out the best way in order to put the new idea under experimental test. This can take years of work. You should not give up. If you believe that your new idea is a good one, you should work hard and never be afraid to reach the point where a new-comer can, with little effort, find the result you have been working, for so many years, to get. The new-comer can never take away from you the privilege of having been the first to open a new field with your intelligence, imagination and hard work. Do not be afraid to encourage others to pursue your dream. If it becomes real, the community will never forget that you have been the first to open the field.\u00bb (1972). ",
