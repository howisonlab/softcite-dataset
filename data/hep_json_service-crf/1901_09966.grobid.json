An effort is underway to develop a comprehensive simulation and use it to validate the results obtained so far. Of particular note, backgrounds from radiative K L decays, cascading hyperon decays, and beamgas interactions remain to be studied, and the neutral-beam halo from more detailed FLUKA simulations needs to be incorporated into the simulation of the experiment. Preliminary studies indicate that the hit and event rates are similar to those in NA62, with the notable exception of the SAC, which will require an innovative readout solution. Offline computing resources required are similarly expected to be on the scale of NA62. A PBC concern is related to the overall cost of the project if compared to the current strength of the Collaboration. The Collaboration is well aware that success in carrying out the KLEVER experimental program will require the involvement of new institutions and groups, with resources to contribute to the project, and initiatives to seek new collaborators are a major focus at present.",

Another strategy to search for heavy neutrinos mixed with \u03bd e , \u03bd \u03bc and \u03bd \u03c4 , is via searches of their decay products. If the HNLs exist, they would be produced in every process containing active neutrinos with a branching fraction proportional to the mixing parameters | | m t U e, , 2 . Then the HNLs would decay via charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) interactions into active neutrinos and other visible final states, as pions, muons and electrons. In beam-dump experiments, the HNLs would be produced in meson decays. Other ways to constrain the couplings of HNLs in a relatively high mass regime is using possible Z 0 decays into heavy neutrinos from LEP data [274]. In this case, only large values of the mixing angle can be explored.",
