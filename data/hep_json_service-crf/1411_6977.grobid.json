Efficiency to find a track in the tracker, measured using cosmic ray muons reconstructed in the muon detectors, as a function of the transverse (left) and longitudinal (right) impact parameters (relative to the nominal interaction point of CMS).

For the left plot, the longitudinal impact parameter jz 0 j is required to be less than 10 cm, and for the right plot, the transverse impact parameter jd 0 j must be less than 4 cm. The bottom panels show the ratio of the efficiency in data to that in simulation. The uncertainties in the simulation are smaller than the size of the markers and are not visible. efficiency is estimated as follows. We use the measured track reconstruction efficiency to estimate the efficiency to reconstruct a pair of leptons of given impact parameters. We then weight this efficiency according to the impact parameter distributions of the dileptons in the simulated signal Monte Carlo samples. The ratio of the estimated efficiency per dilepton candidate in data to simulation differs from unity by no more than 6.1% for any of the samples considered, so this value is taken as the systematic uncertainty.",

These limits restricted to the acceptance region show substantially less dependence on the Higgs boson and X boson masses and on the mean proper decay length c\u03c4 of the X boson. They are also less model dependent, as can be seen by the fact that the limits on \u03c3BA are similar for X \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 and\u03c7 0 \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 \u03bd. The residual dependence of the limits on c\u03c4 is due to the jd 0 j=\u03c3 d > 12 requirement at small values of c\u03c4; whereas at larger values of c\u03c4, it is caused by the fact that, even within the defined acceptance region, the tracking efficiency falls for leptons produced far from the beam line with very large impact parameters.",
