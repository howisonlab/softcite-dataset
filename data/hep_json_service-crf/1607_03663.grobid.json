Pileup offset correction C hybrid including data/MC scale factors, with systematic uncertainty band, for the average 2012 (8 TeV) conditions of \u00b5 = 20 for PF jets without CHS and R = 0.5 at |\u03b7| = 0 versus p T,corr (top left), and at p T,corr = 30 GeV versus |\u03b7| (top right), compared to corrections for 2010 [13] and 2011 [46] data at 7 TeV after extrapolation to similar pileup conditions. The same results are also shown for PF jets with CHS and R = 0.5 at |\u03b7| = 0 versus p T (bottom left), and at p T,corr = 30 GeV versus |\u03b7| (bottom right), compared to corrections for 2011 data at 7 TeV [46]. correction to about 0.85 at p T,corr = 30 GeV (p T,uncorr = 35 GeV). Roughly one third of the remaining pileup is from PF charged hadrons that have not been matched to good pileup vertices, and much of the rest is from PF photons. The CHS algorithm was only fully commissioned at 7 TeV in 2011, and the 2010 (7 TeV) version of the offset corrections did not yet take into account the remaining unmatched pileup tracks. Therefore only results without CHS are shown for 7 TeV in 2010. The pileup offset corrections have been relatively stable over time at 7 TeV in 2010 and 2011, when scaled to similar pileup conditions. This is in part due to the good linearity of the offset corrections for PF and continuous development on the detector side to reduce OOT PU in the calorimeters, and in part due to the adaptability of the jet area method to the prevailing pileup offset.",
