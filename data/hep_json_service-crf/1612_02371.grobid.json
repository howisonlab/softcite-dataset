The contribution from the region 100 < Q 2 < 1000 GeV 2 to the full Q 2 range amounts to 4% on average and reaches up to 50% at the highest p T (D * + ); the extrapolation uncertainty is negligible in most of the bins compared to the corresponding experimental uncertainty; only at the two highest p T (D * + ) bins it approaches 35% of the experimental uncertainty. Thus in the combination procedure the extrapolation uncertainties from all theoretical parameter variations were added in quadrature and treated as an uncorrelated uncertainty. The sensitivity of the shape to the beauty contribution was found to be negligible and therefore was ignored.",

All flexibility of the original MNR code was retained: the factorisation and renormalisation scales, heavy-quark mass, strong coupling constant, fragmentation function and PDFs may be changed in each iteration (in other words, may be treated as fit parameters). The typical timing to calculate one set of the predictions for the considered LHCb datasets is \u223c1 s and the inaccuracy of the predictions is less than 1% comparing to the results obtained with the original MNR code. This allows a PDF fit with these data to converge typically within a few hours. Additionally the results were cross checked with the NLO predictions as calculated by the (semi-) independent FONLL program, using the public web interface [104], 77 and differences were found to be within 1-3%.
