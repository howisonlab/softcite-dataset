These corrections rely, in particular, on the proper description of the interaction cross sections used as input by the transport models. These values were therefore compared with experimental measurements [17,18]. While p-A cross sections are similar in both models and in agreement with existing data, GEANT3 (as well as the current version of GEANT4) significantly overestimates the measured inelastic cross sections for antiprotons in the relevant momentum range by about a factor of 2, whereas FLUKA describes the data very well [19]. Concerning elastic scattering, where only a limited data set is available for comparison, GEANT3 cross sections are about 25% above FLUKA, the latter being again closer to the measurements. We therefore used the FLUKA results to account for the difference of p and \" p cross sections, which amount to a correction of the \" p=p ratio by 8% and 3.5% for absorption and elastic scattering, respectively.",
