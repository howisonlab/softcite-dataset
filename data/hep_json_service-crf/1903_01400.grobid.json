The tt +E miss T analysis [25, 27, 28] is split into three channels according to the decays of the W bosons from the top-quark decays: 0-lepton, where both W bosons decay hadronically, 1-lepton, where one of the two W bosons decays leptonically and 2-leptons where both W bosons decay leptonically. The analyses targeting the 0-lepton channel exploit two sets of signal topologies: spin-0 DM models [25], used for the DM interpretations presented in this paper, and top-squark decays into a top quark and a neutralino [28], used for the DE interpretation in this paper. Both analyses are characterised by a set of signal regions which select events with at least four energetic jets, at least two of which are b-tagged, and relatively high E miss T . Requirements on the invariant mass of reclustered large-R jets are imposed to identify events where a W boson or a top quark are boosted. The dominant backgrounds (Z+jets, top-quark processes and tt + Z) are constrained in dedicated control regions. The three signal regions used for the DE interpretation are statistically combined, while the two signal regions in the DM analysis are not. The analysis targeting the 1-lepton channel selects events with at least four energetic jets, at least one of which is b-tagged, one isolated lepton and high E miss",
