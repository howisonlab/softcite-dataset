For the \u03b3 * L \u2192 V L transition, there is a rigorous proof of factorization in hard subprocesses and GPD amplitudes [13] in the generalized Bjorken regime of large Q 2 , large W but fixed x B . Contributions to longitudinal amplitudes come from GPDs H and E, only. In contrast, the \u03b3 * T \u2192 V T amplitudes are infrared singular in collinear approximation. In order to regularize this singularity, the so-called modified perturbative approach has been used in Refs. [14,15] in which quark transverse momenta are retained in the subprocess, while the emission and reabsorption of the partons from the proton are still treated collinear to the incoming and outgoing proton momenta. The quark transverse momenta in the subprocess imply a separation of color charges, which results in gluon radiation, as it was calculated in Ref. [48] in next-to-leadinglog approximation and resummed to all orders of perturbative QCD. This gluon radiation is also taken into account in Refs. [14,15].",
