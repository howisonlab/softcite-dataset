While the region 158 < m H < 175 GeV has been excluded at the 95% CL by a combination of searches at CDF and D0 [3][4][5][6], the remaining mass range continues to be probed at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The associated production of a Higgs boson and a leptonically-decaying W boson is among the cleanest Higgs boson search channels at the Tevatron, and provides the largest usable event yield for the decay H \u2192 bb in the range m H < 135 GeV. Several searches for W H production at a pp center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 1.96 TeV have been published. Three of these [7][8][9] use subsamples (0.17 fb \u22121 , 0.44 fb \u22121 , and 1.1 fb \u22121 ) of the data analyzed in this Letter, while three from the CDF Collaboration are based on cumulative samples (0.32 fb \u22121 , 0.95 fb \u22121 and 2.7 fb \u22121 ) of integrated luminosity [10][11][12]. We present a new search using an improved multivariate technique, in 5.3 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected by the D0 detector. The search selects events with one charged lepton ( = electron, e, or muon, \u03bc), an imbalance in transverse energy (/ E T ) that arises from the unobserved neutrino in the W \u2192 \u03bd decay, and either two or three jets, with one or two of these selected as candidate b-quark jets (b-tagged).",
