Transverse SSA's in pion production at RHIC were initially measured by the STAR experiment at \u221a s = 200 GeV. 20 The asymmetry in forward neutral pion production was found to be positive and increasing with x F , as at E704. Subsequent measurements of forward charged pions by BRAHMS at 200 GeV revealed the same pattern as observed at 19.4 GeV: positive and negative pions exhibit near mirror symmetry in their behavior versus x F , with a larger magnitude than the neutral pions. In 2006, data at the intermediate energy of \u221a s = 62.4 GeV was taken at RHIC, and measurements of charged pions by BRAHMS 21 and neutral pions by PHENIX 22 again demonstrated the same pattern. In Fig. 2, the asymmetries for charged pions at all three energies are shown in overlapping kinematic ranges. The data at 62.4 and 200 GeV are for a transverse momentum (p T ) selection of 0.5-0.8 GeV/c; the 19.4 GeV data is for p T > 0.7 GeV/c. The positive pion points overlap at all three energies, suggesting some kind of scaling behavior. The negative pion asymmetry at the lowest energy, however, appears to have a somewhat smaller magnitude than at the two higher energies. In any case, the similarities among the three energies are striking and suggest a common origin.",
