            "text": ". In principle, a single cavity can therefore act as a gravitational wave detector, but one gains in sensitivity by simultaneously monitoring another, identical arm oriented at a right angle, not merely because of the potential to double the signal strength from optimum quadrupole orientation, but much more important, mundane noise sources that affect the input field amplitude E 0 and phase cancel in the difference-signal. The above analysis idealized the laser light as a plane wave and used planar mirrors. But high-quality lasers produce Gaussian beams with curved wavefronts. Fabry-Perot cavities are normally designed with at least one curved mirror (usually concave as seen from the cavity), such that a Gaussian beam resonates with a spherical wavefront at the mirror(s) with radii of wavefront curvature at those locations to match those of the mirror(s). For a cavity of length L with two concave mirrors of radii R 1 and R 2 , it is useful [119] to define mirror g factors g i \u2261 1 \u2212 L/R i , from which one can derive the beam's characteristic intensity radii at the mirrors (w 1 and w 2 ) and the beam's \"waist\" (minimum radius):",
