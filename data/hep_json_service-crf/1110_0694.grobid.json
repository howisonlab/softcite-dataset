We also vary the range in which we fit the distributions; all these changes give a 0.013% variation in the  result. The uncertainty of the width ratio f , which is fixed in the fit, propagates into a 0.012% uncertainty in the result. By adding the last two numbers in quadrature we obtain an estimate of 0.018% for the systematic uncertainty of the fitting procedure. The last source is the selection of fit results; by changing the requirement from N/\u03c3 N > 3 to N/\u03c3 N > 5 we obtain a 0.020% variation in the result. We estimate the total systematic uncertainty by summing individual contributions in quadrature and obtain 0.050%.

In this mass region the decays D + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + are dominant (> 90%). We have made no attempt to disentangle the \u03c6 from other intermediate resonances.
