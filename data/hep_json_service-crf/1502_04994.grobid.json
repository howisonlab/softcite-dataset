For the all-leptonic and semileptonic channels, additional uncertainties come from the procedure of removing nearby tracks and leptons used in the hadronic \u03c4 reconstruction, and from the isolation variable computation in the case of boosted topologies. The inefficiency resulting from these procedures, as measured in signal simulation, is assigned as a systematic uncertainty, corresponding to 1-16% for \u03c4 reconstruction and 1-21% for isolation. In the all-hadronic analysis, a constant uncertainty of 10% is assigned for the application of the \u03c4 reconstruction procedure to collimated subjets, comparing the performance for isolated and non-isolated \u03c4 leptons in simulation. The jet trigger efficiency has an uncertainty of <1%, as determined from a less selective trigger. Following the method derived for vector boson identification in merged jets [58], a scale factor of 0.94 \u00b1 0.06 is used for the efficiency of the pruning and subjet searching techniques applied on the CA jet, where the uncertainty is included in the estimation of the overall systematic uncertainty. For the b tagging, data-to-MC corrections derived from several control samples are applied and the uncertainties on these corrections are propagated as systematic uncertainties in the analysis (2-6%). The procedure used to derive the b-tagging systematic uncertainties is described in Ref. [54].",
