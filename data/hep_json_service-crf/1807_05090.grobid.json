Constructing the correlations in a fixed bin of x E allows for a better comparison between bins of p trig T since x E is a proxy for the away-side longitudinal momentum fraction z. The measured p out distributions are shown in the left panel of Fig. 1, where the open (filled) markers are the \u03c0 0 -hadron (direct photon-hadron) correlations and each marker color shows a different p trig T bin. The distributions show a two component shape, which is characterized by a Gaussian fit at small p out and a power law-like tail from the Gaussian at large p out . The two shapes arise due to sensitivity to soft gluon radiation in the |p out | \u223c 0 region and hard gluon radiation in the |p out | 0 region, indicating the applicability of a TMD framework since there is sensitivity to both a hard and soft transverse momentum scale. The Gaussian widths, shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, increase as a function of p trig T , which is qualitatively consistent with nonperturbative momentum width measurements in the Drell-Yan process where factorization is predicted to hold (see e.g. [4]). Future quantitative phenomenological comparisons will be necessary which compare these different processes to understand the quantitative magnitude of TMD factorization breaking effects.   ",
