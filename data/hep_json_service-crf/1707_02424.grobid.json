The symbol \u03b3 \u00b5 denotes the gamma matrices, and the parameters \u03b7 ij , where i and j are L or R (left or right), define the chiral structure of the new interaction. Different chiral structures are investigated here, with the left-right (right-left) model obtained by setting \u03b7 LR = \u00b11 (\u03b7 RL = \u00b11) and all other parameters to zero. Likewise, the left-left and right-right models are obtained by setting the corresponding parameters to \u00b11, and the others to zero.
