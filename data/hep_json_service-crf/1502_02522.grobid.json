In the pMSSM, all MSSM parameters are allowed to vary freely, subject to the requirement that the model is consistent with some basic constraints: first, the sparticle spectrum must be free of tachyons and cannot lead to color or charge breaking minima in the scalar potential. We also require that the model is consistent with electroweak symmetry breaking and that the Higgs potential is bounded from below. Finally, in this study, we also require the lightest SUSY particle to be the lightest neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ).
