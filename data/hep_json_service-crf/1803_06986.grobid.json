To verify that the good performance demonstrated in the gluon jet enriched VR (QGLR < 0.5) also holds in the quark jet enriched SR (QGLR > 0.5), we investigate another CR. Specifically, the b tagging criteria are changed by selecting jets that fulfil some intermediate but not the formal medium b tagging requirement, which corresponds to an efficiency for tagging b jets of \u224875% with a misidentification rate of \u22484%. The classified jets are then used to form jet and b jet multiplicity categories in analogy with the SR. Since these categories are orthogonal to the categories in the SR, they are used to verify that the background estimation is valid for QGLR > 0.5. In all validation regions, this background estimation reproduces the kinematic distributions measured in data. In the remainder of this paper, all multijet estimates are based on data, unless stated to the contrary.",
