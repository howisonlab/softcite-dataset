Such hard diffractive processes can be described in terms of the convolution of diffractive parton distribution functions (dPDFs) and hard scattering cross sections, which are calculable in pQCD. In this approach, the pomeron is treated as a color-singlet combination of partons with the vacuum quantum numbers. The dPDFs have been determined by the HERA experiments [7,9] by means of QCD fits to inclusive diffractive deep inelastic scattering data, and have been successfully used to describe different hard diffractive processes in ep collisions. This success is based on the factorization theorem for diffractive electron-proton interactions, and on the validity of the QCD evolution equations for the dPDFs [11][12][13]. However, in hard diffractive hadron-hadron collisions factorization does not hold because of soft scatterings between the spectator partons, leading to the suppression of the observed diffractive cross section. The suppression is quantified by the socalled ''rapidity gap survival probability'' [14], which is a nonperturbative quantity with large theoretical uncertainties [15][16][17][18]. It was measured to be about 10% in diffractive dijet production in p\" p collisions at the Tevatron [5].",
