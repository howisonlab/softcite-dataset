It is remarkable that R p falls below the LO pQCD prediction over the whole measured z range, which starts in this analysis from z > 0.5. This effect was observed for R K only for z > 0.8. We note that the measured z-dependence of R p can be fitted in both xbins by simple functional forms, e.g. \u221d (1 \u2212 z) \u03b2 . The obtained \u03b2  The ratio R p falls below R K in the whole measured phase space. The kaon data come from Refs. [10,12].
