The process W \u00b1 \u03b3\u03b3 was calculated at leading order in (Baur et al., 1997), and can be used as a test of the QGC. This process was then calculated at NLO in QCD (Lazopoulos et al., 2007). By now, general triboson processes are available at NLO in QCD, for example implemented in the generator VBFNLO. The effects of EW corrections have also been calculated at NLO accuracy for instance in (Yong-Bai et al., 2016) for W W W and in (Yong-Bai et al., 2015) for W ZZ. Higher multiplicity EW gauge boson production will also be observable in the future, and can be computed with existing MC generators at NLO in QCD.",
