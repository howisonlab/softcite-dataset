The production of jet2 around the photon and jet1 is measured separately to investigate the differences between the two configurations. The scale evolution of the photon plus one-jet system is studied by measuring the cross sections as functions of cos \u03b8 * in different regions of m \u03b3 \u2212jet1 . For photon plus two-and three-jet events, the scale evolution is investigated by measuring the angular correlations in different regions of E \u03b3 T . The predictions from the event generators PYTHIA [21] and SHERPA [22] are compared with the measurements. The next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD predictions from JETPHOX [23,24] are compared with the photon plus one-jet measurements, whereas those from BLACKHAT [25,26] are compared with the photon plus two-jet and photon plus three-jet measurements.",
