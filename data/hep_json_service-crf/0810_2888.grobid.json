Physics beyond the SM could in general change the picture; for this reason it is very important to make many independent measurements to possibly find inconsistencies of the SM. In the evolution of B 0 B 0 pairs, we reconstruct the decay of one meson to final f at proper time t f , and identify (tag) its flavor using information from the other B meson in the event, decaying at time t tag . The time-dependent CP asymmetry of B 0 (B 0 ) mesons decaying to final state f can be defined as A CP (\u2206t) \u2261 (N f \u2212 N f )/(N f + N f ) = S f sin(\u2206m d \u2206t) \u2212 C f cos(\u2206m d \u2206t). Here \u2206t \u2261 t f \u2212 t tag , and \u2206m d is the mass difference of the B meson mass eigenstates. 1 .

In the present article we will follow the \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, C f nomenclature.",
