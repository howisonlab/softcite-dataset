Furthermore, since the N lifetime is inversely proportional to m 5 N |V N | 2 , for m N < 20 GeV it becomes significant and results in displaced decays. Thus the prompt lepton requirement is not satisfied. The behavior of the limits around m N = 80 GeV is caused by the fact that as the mass of the heavy Majorana neutrino approaches the W boson mass, the lepton produced together with the N or the lepton from the N decay has very low p T .",
