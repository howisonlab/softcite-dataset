This results in a significant improvement in the uncertainties for the gluon distribution function at small momentum fraction x. Two predictions for the integrated cross-section are provided, one an absolute calculation, identical to that for the differential cross-sections, and the other scaled from the 7 TeV measurement. The GMVFNS calculations include theoretical predictions for all mesons studied in this analysis. Results are provided for 3 < p T < 30 GeV/c. Here the CT10 [47] set of parton distributions is used. The GMVFNS theoretical framework includes the convolution with fragmentation functions describing the transition c \u2192 H c that are normalised to the respective total transition probabilities [7,48]. The fragmentation functions are taken from a fit to production measurements at e + e \u2212 colliders, where no attempt is made to separate direct production and feed-down from higher resonances.",
