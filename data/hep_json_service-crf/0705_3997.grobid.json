Lawrence the first circular accelerator at Berkeley in 1930, had formulated an empirical linear scaling law for the available centre-of-mass energy vs. the construction year and cost. Using Livingstone curve, Fermi predicted that such an accelerator could be built in 1994 at a cost of 170 billion $. We have learned that, not only such accelerator could not be built, but accelerator physics has irrevocably fallen off the Livingstone curve, even in its revised version, which includes data up to the 1980's. As horizons expanded, each step has involved more and more technical challenges and has required more resources. The future promises to be along this same path. This underlines the need of coherent and responsible long term planning while sustaining a rich R&D program in both accelerator and detector techniques.",
