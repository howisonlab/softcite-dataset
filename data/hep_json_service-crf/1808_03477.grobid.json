New reconstruction strategies could enhance the sensitivity of LHCb to K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 and other similar final states, such as those mentioned above. Given that the position of the K 0 S production and decay vertices can be determined, the invariant-mass resolution of the K 0 S could be calculated ignoring the absolute momentum of one of the four final state particles through relativistic kinematic constraints. This is advantageous as the invariant-mass resolution becomes less dependent on bremsstrahlung, given that the direction of electrons in the VELO is barely influenced by such effects. In addition, this technique could allow a more efficient reconstruction of these electrons, using tracks not required to have a segment after the magnet. Taking into account that the VELO pattern recognition efficiency is at the level of \u223c 70% [40], even for tracks with p \u223c O(1 MeV/c), improvements in the reconstruction efficiency up to a factor of 10 could be theoretically possible.",
