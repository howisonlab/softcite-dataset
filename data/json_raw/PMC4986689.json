            "text": "Background: In the last 4 years, four novel oral anticoagulants have been developed as alternatives to warfarin and antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. The objective of this review was to estimate the comparative effectiveness of all antithrombotic treatments for AF patients. Materials and methods: Data sources were Medline Ovid (1946 to October 2015), Embase Ovid (1980 to October 2015), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 9, 2015). Randomized controlled trials of AF patients were selected if they compared at least two of the following: placebo, aspirin, aspirin and clopidogrel combination therapy, adjusted-dose warfarin (target international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Bayesian network meta-analyses were conducted for outcomes of interest (all stroke, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, overall mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage). Results: Based on 16 randomized controlled trials of 96,826 patients, all oral anticoagulants were more effective than antiplatelet agents at reducing the risk of ischemic stroke and all strokes. Compared to warfarin, dabigatran 150 mg (rate ratio 0.65, 95% credible interval 0.52-0.82) and apixaban (rate ratio 0.82, 95% credible interval 0.69-0.97) reduced the risk of all strokes. Dabigatran 150 mg was also more effective than warfarin at reducing ischemic stroke risk (rate ratio 0.76, 95% credible interval 0.59-0.99). Aspirin, apixaban, dabigatran 110 mg, and edoxaban were associated with less major bleeding than warfarin. Conclusion: All oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke in AF patients. Some novel oral anticoagulants are associated with a lower stroke and/or major bleeding risk than warfarin. In addition to the safety and effectiveness of drug therapy, as reported in this study, individual treatment recommendations should also consider the patient's underlying stroke and bleeding risk profile.",

            "text": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and affects between 0.5% and 2% of the population in Western countries. AF is also a growing health problem in developing countries, concordant with the increasing health burden of other chronic noncommunicable diseases. 1 AF is associated with significant morbidity and a high risk of ischemic stroke. AF patients are five times more likely to experience an ischemic stroke than the general population, with 20% of patients dying within 1 year after stroke and 60% being left with a disability. 2 Therefore, the majority of patients with AF must be on antithrombotic treatment for stroke prevention for the remainder of their lives. Patients are prescribed either antiplatelet drugs or oral anticoagulants (OACs) as antithrombotic therapy. As a result of the increased risk of bleeding associated with these agents, the benefits of treatment must be carefully weighed against the risks. Patients at low risk of stroke are typically prescribed antiplatelet drugs or in some cases no treatment. Similarly, patients at moderate-to-high risk of stroke are typically prescribed OACs, but may be prescribed antiplatelet drugs or even nothing. [3][4][5] ",

A hierarchical Bayesian approach was followed, and models were fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. 15 Data were analyzed using fixed-and randomeffect models, and prior distributions for each parameter of interest were assumed. For relative-effectiveness estimates, a vague normal prior probability (n 0,1,000 ) was assumed.

Studies with no events in any arm for a particular outcome were excluded from that outcome's network of studies. All models were run until convergence was reached.

Overall, we observed a reduction in ICHs with the NOACs when compared to warfarin. Although dabigatran 150 mg was shown to be superior to warfarin at reducing ischemic strokes, apixaban and edoxaban LD were the only treatments to demonstrate a mortality advantage over warfarin. Given that apixaban and edoxaban LD are associated with a lower major-bleeding risk than warfarin, these results may be an indication that overall mortality is driven more by major bleeding than ischemic stroke in AF patients. One advantage of using a Bayesian NMA approach is the ability to rank treatments. This is in contrast to traditional meta-analysis, which must assume a class effect. 34 Our ranking results have implications for clinical practice. For example, if a patient's bleeding risk is higher than their risk of ischemic stroke, but their risk of ischemic stroke is high enough to require an OAC, apixaban may be a better option for them than dabigatran 150 mg. If a patient's bleeding risk is very high, they might benefit from being on edoxaban LD or even no treatment, as edoxaban LD and placebo were ranked as the preferred options in reducing the risk of major bleeding.",

For example, trials comparing ASA, placebo, and warfarin to each other are relatively old, and may not reflect the patients or outcomes seen today. These include high proportions of patients with valvular disease who are at much higher risk of stroke than those with nonvalvular disease. 46 Additionally, as patient INRs may not be monitored as closely in practice as they are in clinical trials, the effectiveness of other treatments when compared to warfarin in clinical trials may be underestimated. 47 A final limitation is the inclusion of only English-language studies, although there is currently a lack of evidence that excluding non-English studies from published systematic reviews of interventions in conventional medicine leads to biased estimates of an intervention's effectiveness. 47 In conclusion, in the absence of head-to-head RCTs of antithrombotic treatments in patients with AF, we can only estimate their relative effectiveness indirectly. This NMA supports the use of OACs over antiplatelet agents or no treatment for stroke prevention in AF patients, following careful consideration of their bleeding risk. Each treatment option compared in this analysis is associated with a unique safety and efficacy profile, but this alone does not suffice to make an individual treatment decision. Our results further confirm the difficulty in balancing the risk of ischemic stroke with that of bleeding associated with stroke prevention in AF patients. Decision-analytic models may assist in providing additional guidance for classes of patients with varying stroke and bleeding risk. This approach allows for a formal consideration of risk, benefit, and cost; factors that are all important in determining the optimal approach to managing this very challenging condition.",
