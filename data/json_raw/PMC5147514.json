            "text": "It is well-established that inflammation plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD). Inflammation and synapse loss occur in disease prior to the formation of larger aggregates, but the contribution of tau to inflammation has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Tau pathologically aggregates to form large fibrillar structures known as tangles. However, evidence suggests that smaller soluble aggregates, called oligomers, are the most toxic species and form prior to tangles. Furthermore, tau oligomers can spread to neighboring cells and between anatomically connected brain regions. In addition, recent evidence suggests that inspecting the retina may be a window to brain pathology. We hypothesized that there is a relationship between tau oligomers and inflammation, which are hallmarks of early disease. We conducted immunofluorescence and biochemical analyses on tauopathy mice, FTLD, and AD subjects. We showed that oligomers co-localize with astrocytes, microglia, and HMGB1, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Additionally, we show that tau oligomers are present in the retina and are associated with inflammatory cells suggesting that the retina may be a valid non-invasive biomarker for brain pathology. These results suggest that there may be a toxic relationship between tau oligomers and inflammation. Therefore, the ability of tau oligomers to spread may initiate a feed-forward cycle in which tau oligomers induce inflammation, leading to neuronal damage, and thus more inflammation. Further mechanistic studies are warranted in order to understand this relationship, which may have critical implications for improving the treatment of tauopathies."

            "text": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the increased production of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424), and the altered processing of the protein tau, are associated with synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death that leads to cognitive and behavioral deficits. It is becoming increasingly apparent that another prominent feature of AD brains is inflammation, which has a significant influence on disease progression [1]. The majority of transgenic mouse models of AD exhibit substantial reactive gliosis with the accumulation of activated astrocytes and microglia in affected brain regions, often prior to the appearance of plaque and tangle pathology [2]. The severity of inflammation in many of these animals correlates with neuronal death [2], and moreover, the local inflammatory environment directly influences the rate of disease progression and the extent of neuronal loss [3]. Recent data shows that astrocyte-mediated inflammatory responses play a significant role in mediating neurotoxic responses to A\u2424 [4]. Importantly, these results suggest that disrupting inflammatory signaling, in combination with other therapies such as anti-oligomer therapies, could provide a novel neuroprotective intervention for AD and related diseases.",

            "text": "The pathological aggregation of the microtubuleassociated protein, tau, culminates in large insoluble aggregates known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and other inclusions containing hyperphosphorylated tau. These aggregates are the defining histopathological features of AD and other tauopathies, including frontotemporal lobar dementia with tau (FTLD-tau), Pick's disease, and corticobasal degeneration [5]. FTLD encompasses a broad spectrum of distinct pathologies and protein aggregations that manifest with similar symptoms, ranging from primary tauopathy to transactive response DNA/RNA binding protein-43  or Fus positive inclusions [6,7]. In FTLD-TDP there are TDP-43 positive, \u2423-synuclein negative, and tau negative inclusions. They typically do not have extensive tangle pathology [8], but little to no research has been conducted on smaller tau oligomers in FTLD-TDP which we have investigated here. Recent research has shown that the NFTs themselves are not the most toxic form of tau, but rather the smaller aggregates called tau oligomers likely initiate neurodegeneration in tauopathies [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23].",

There is a higher incidence of age-related macular degeneration in patients with AD [27]. While the link remains unclear between retinal degeneration and neurodegeneration, there is increasing evidence that they may be linked. Tau oligomers were recently found in the retina of a rat model for glaucoma and suppression of tau reduced the occurrence of retinal degeneration [28]. Also, there is evidence of large protein deposits, such as A\u2424 and tau, being present in the retina of AD patients and in tauopathy mice as well as the presence of inflammation [24-26, 29, 30]. Early detection of AD, possibly even prodromal detection, would allow for the early intervention and prevention of neurodegeneration prior to major synapse loss and cognitive decline. Using the retina for the detection of both retinal damage and AD would also be noninvasive, inexpensive, and could be translated into the clinic as part of a normal screening done at patient checkups.",

            "text": "Neuroinflammation is often thought to be a response induced by A\u2424 in AD [3,32], given this, there are few reports investigating the role of tau oligomers in neuroinflammation. The studies that have investigated tau indicate tau may play a role in neuroinflammation and may be an early contributor to neurodegeneration [33,34]. These results warrant further investigation. Thus, we used tauopathy mice and postmortem FTLD-TDP, and AD brain samples to study tau oligomers and inflammation. The tauopathy mice that we used contained the P301L mutation, which is implicated in some genetic tauopathies. In addition, this mutation, along with the related P301S mutation, has been associated with increased inflammation in the brain as well as retinal deficits [24,33]. However, these events were investigated in isolation and were not investigated thoroughly to determine if they are linked. Also, FTLD-TDP samples were used because they do not have A\u2424 plaques or tau tangles, thus removing these conditions as potential confounding factors for inflammation. Additionally, tau oligomers have never been examined in FTLD-TDP and may play a role in the late stages of the disease. Thus, we used this model to determine the role tau oligomers play in inflammation in the absence of A\u2424 and NFTs. We hypothesized that tau oligomers play a role in the feed forward cycle of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative tauopathies. We performed systematic immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses of brain tissue from transgenic tau mice and FTLD patients. Analyses were performed using a tau oligomer-specific antibody in combination with antibodies for inflammatory markers, including astrocytes and microglia. Our data shows that tau oligomers are associated with markers for neuroinflammation suggesting that tau oligomers may play a role in a feed forward mechanisms resulting in chronic neuroinflammation. These descriptive results call attention to the important and novel role tau oligomers may play in inflammation and in accelerating neurodegeneration. Furthermore, these results validate the potential of the retina to be used as biomarker of neurodegeneration. This study demonstrates a need to identify and characterize the relationship and mechanism behind the association of tau oligomers and inflammation. Perhaps, disrupting this association through anti-oligomer and anti-inflammatory combination therapies can slow the progression, or even halt, neurodegenerative tauopathies.",

Using ImageJ, the corrected cell fluorescence method was used to quantify the images as previously described [35,36]. Briefly, there were four separate images from each section analyzed using this method where five cells were measured as well as five background regions. In order to account for cell size and background, the background was multiplied by the area of the cell and subtracted from the total fluorescence. One-way ANOVA, student's t-tests, or Pearson's correlation were used to analyze the corrected cell fluorescence on Graphpad Prism 6 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA). In addition, Pearson's correlation coefficient was measured to quantify the strength of co-localization between T22 and GFAP using ImageJ software.",

Labeling the P301L mouse retina with T22, Iba1, and DAPI revealed microglial cells co-localizing with tau oligomers in the ROS (Fig. 1). There was also evidence of hyperactivation and proliferation of microglial cells at the ROS and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell layers. Activation of microglia was seen throughout the retina of P301L transgenic mice. Of note, are small cell bodies with irregular, short, cell processes that are present near the deposits of T22 positive tau oligomers. Co-localization of the microglia with tau oligomers may indicate the engulfment of the oligomers by the activated microglia. Additionally, we detected glial cell processes of Muller cells extending to the outer nuclear cells, co-localizing with mutant tau oligomers, and concurring with the phagocytic nature of the Muller cells in a pathological event (Fig. 1). Both thick and thin ramifications of the Muller cell processes were noted throughout the outer nuclear layer, as well as in close apposition to the outer limiting membrane. Also noted were multiple small cell bodies of Muller cells in the inner nuclear layer, with some dendritic spurs towards the ganglion cell layers. These findings help support the idea that eyes can be used as a means to study some of the pathological changes in the central nervous system.",

We found that tau oligomers were surrounded by the astrocyte marker, GFAP. Additionally, there was a significant increase in GFAP protein levels as compared to the control (Fig. 2). It is important to note that GFAP did not appear to co-localize with tau oligomers directly, yet GFAP was in close proximity suggesting that tau oligomers are interacting with astrocytes but not engulfing the tau oligomers. The astrocytes appear to be surrounding the tau oligomer containing cells but not fully internalizing the tau oligomers (Fig. 2F, I). To more accurately quantify GFAP protein levels and total tau protein, we conducted a direct ELISA. We found that in FTLD and AD, astrocyte levels were significantly higher than in the age-matched controls (Fig. 2J).

            "text": "In order to confirm and further validate the association between astrocytes and tau oligomers we used the Htau mouse model. The Htau mouse model was used here because it expresses all six human tau isoforms without expressing mouse tau making it a better model for sporadic tauopathy. In addition, Htau mice have been shown to have neuroinflammation previously allowing us to investigate if this inflammation can be linked to tau oligomers [34]. Using immunofluorescence of cortical regions with GFAP and T22 tau oligomer-specific antibodies, we found that the number of astrocytes in Htau mice changes with age and in comparison to WT mice (Fig. 3). Seven-month-old WT mice exhibited low levels of reactive astrocytes and negligible tau oligomer staining. We showed that at 3 months of age, Htau mice have only limited astrocyte activation, but by 11 months, Htau mice begin to show evidence of fragmented astrocytes, as well as some reactive morphology. Astrocyte activation is dramatically increased when tau oligomers are present at higher levels in the brains of 24-month-old Htau mice. GFAP corrected cell fluorescence was significantly increased in the brains of Htau mice, increasing with the age of the mice as well as in comparison to the WT mice. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between GFAP and T22 corrected cell fluorescence regardless of age or genotype (r = 0.662, r 2 = 0.439, p < 0.01). These data suggest a possible interaction between tau oligomers and reactive astrocytes in inflammation.",

Tau oligomers co-localized with microglia in FTLD and AD subjects, suggesting that tau oligomers may play a role in stimulating inflammation (Fig. 4). In contrast to the astrocytes, co-localization suggests internalization of the tau oligomers. Microglial quantification by corrected cell fluorescence also showed a significant increase in Iba1 in FTLD and AD, which is common in inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Next, we examined the relationship of microglia and tau oligomers in Htau cortices. We used Iba1 and T22 to immunolabel brains from WT and Htau mice. We found little evidence of microglial activation in WT mice and negligible labeling for tau oligomers, as expected for a WT animal. However, in Htau mice at 24 months of age, a significant increase in activated microglia was detected, largely co-localizing with tau oligomers (Fig. 5). This was consistent with the results seen in the human cases and indicates a potential interplay between toxic oligomeric tau and microglia. In addition, this co-localization could indicate that tau oligomers are being internalized by the microglia, which may increase the spread of pathology [38].",

            "text": "To further characterize inflammation, we investigated the association of tau oligomers with the chromatin protein, high motility group box 1 (HMGB1). HMGB1 is a protein normally found within the nucleus of cells that are not undergoing inflammatory processes. During inflammation, however, HMGB1   ANOVA with multiple comparisons showed a significant difference between WT and 24-month-old Htau mice. 24-month-old Htau mice were also significantly higher than 3-month-old Htau mice. There was a steady increase in GFAP as the Htau mice aged, consistent with astrogliosis and disease progression. N) As GFAP increased, T22 positive tau oligomer staining also increased with WT and 3-month-old Htau mice in the lower left portion of the correlation and increasing with the 24-month-old mice as shown in the upper right. There was a moderate correlation between GFAP and T22 positive tau oligomer staining (r = 0.662, r 2 = 0.439, p < 0.01). * * * * p < 0.0001, * * * p < 0.001. Scale bar 20 m.  can translocate from the nucleus to the cytosol and can then be secreted as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. We conducted T22 and HMGB1 immunofluorescence on tissues from the frontal cortex of FTLD, AD, and agematched controls. HMGB1 localized to the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus, as was seen in the control subjects indicating inflammatory signaling in the FTLD and AD subjects (Fig. 6). HMGB1 showed signifi-cantly increased corrected cell fluorescence in FTLD and AD samples compared to controls. The increase in HMGB1 and its translocation to the cytoplasm indicate it has been activated as a pro-inflammatory signal in FTLD and AD brains. The co-localization of tau oligomers with HMGB1 suggests there may be an interaction between tau oligomers and inflammatory signaling. To further characterize the relationship Fig. 6. Tau oligomers co-localized with HMGB1 in the frontal cortex of FTLD and AD subjects. A-C) Control subjects showed HMGB1 (red) in proximity to the nucleus (enlargement in C). D-F) FTLD samples displayed HMGB1 translocated out of the nucleus (enlargement in F). T22 positive tau oligomers (green) were co-localized with HMGB1 in FTLD. G-I) AD frontal cortex showed a consistent co-localization between HMGB1 and T22 positive tau oligomers as seen in FTLD. J) There were significantly elevated levels of HMGB1 in FTLD and AD brains compared to controls that were quantified using corrected cell fluorescence. * p < 0.05, * * * * p < 0.0001. Scale bar 20 m. of HMGB1 and tau oligomers in the cortex we conducted immunofluorescence in WT and Htau mice. We found that HMGB1 was detected at low levels that were, primarily, associated with the nucleus in WT mice (Fig. 7). HMGB1 was transported out of the nuclei in 24-month-old Htau mice, a condition that was representative of the activation of HMGB1 as an inflammatory cytokine. These results were consistent with those seen in the brains of human subjects. However, tau oligomers co-localized with HMGB1 to a much lesser extent in mice as compared to the human samples, suggesting the relationship between tau oligomers and the pro-inflammatory cytokine HMGB1 may be different between species or that the relationship is more complex. These results warrant further research to determine more specifically the mechanisms in human subjects.",

We recently demonstrated that tau oligomers form prior to NFTs, are present intra-and extracellularly, are highly toxic, induce cognitive deficits in vivo, and play a crucial role in neuronal cytopathology [11,22,39,40]. We also established the specificity and efficacy of one tau oligomer-specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes a conformationally distinct subset of tau oligomers in the same tauopathy animal models used in the present study: aged P301L mice [41,42] and Htau mice [43,44]. Furthermore, we published evidence that tau oligomer transformation into pore-like structures is cell-specific and disease-specific [45]. In addition we were able to isolate, characterize, and propagate tau oligomers from postmortem brain tissue of patients with various neurodegenerative diseases, as well as, patients with traumatic brain injury [35,36,44].",

            "text": "Our results demonstrate that tau oligomers may induce inflammation in FTLD, AD, and potentially, other neurodegenerative diseases, thus linking tau oligomer deposition to inflammatory signaling in the brain. It is interesting that our results suggest that astrocytes interact with tau oligomers but do not appear to engulf them, while microglia showed extensive co-localization. This is consistent with data in current literature that indicates that microglia can engulf tau oligomers and secrete them in exosomes, facilitating their propagation to surrounding cells [38]. Tau oligomers and inflammation may be selfreinforcing stimuli leading to chronic inflammation, physiological impairments, cellular dysfunction, and ultimately, neurodegeneration. Additionally, the spread of tau oligomers from one brain region to another [37,46,47] may initiate inflammation, inducing a toxic cycle of tau oligomers, inflammation, and cell death in larger anatomical areas (Fig. 8). This suggests that the propagation of tau oligomers may also propagate inflammation and increase the rate of degeneration. Future studies characterizing the inflammation phenotypes specific to tau oligomers in FTLD, AD, and other neurodegenerative diseases should elucidate the mechanism and confirm that tau oligomers are inducing the inflammation. Our results are novel in that they associate tau oligomers specifically with inflammation, a process that occurs early in disease pathogenesis, and they lay the foundation for future studies to explore this relationship. Further studies should be done to investigate whether inflammation can induce oligomer production, which would contribute to this vicious cycle. Our results confirm inflammation as a contributing factor to the neurodegenerative disease cascade, and they have implications for therapeutic approaches [32].",

            "text": "Another exciting result from our research is the discovery of the association between tau oligomers and HMGB1, which is an important mediator for inflammation in the brain, as well as peripherally. HMGB1 has been well-established as a pro-inflammatory cytokine when it is released into the extracellular space and is produced by neurons, astrocytes, and microglia [48][49][50]. In addition, astrocytes and microglia can respond to HMGB1 by producing proinflammatory conditions, which is suggested to play an important role in neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases [51][52][53]. HMGB1 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine, but it has also been implicated in a necrotic cell death response [54,55]. Following acute injuries, such as ischemic brain insults, HMGB1 is translocated out of the nucleus and appears to play a role in necrosis or necroptosis (programed cell death in response to injury) [55]. However, it is unlikely that the HMGB1 response seen here is necrosis related due to that fact that neurodegeneration is a process lasting many years to many decades. Rather, it is much more likely that the HMGB1 translocation out of the nucleus is stimulating the pro-inflammatory signaling pathways leading Fig. 8. A hypothetical model of the toxic relationship between tau oligomers and inflammation. A) Tau oligomers can spread from brain region to brain region, potentially triggering inflammation and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by interacting with astrocytes and microglia. The inflammation may become chronic, resulting in further damage to the neurons and in turn, increased inflammation and eventual cell death. B) RAGE, a potential receptor for tau oligomers, signals NFB through several pathways including through RAS and p38. This increases the production of both RAGE and its ligand, HMGB1, initiating a feed-forward mechanism producing a state of chronic inflammation. Additionally, p38 is known to phosphorylate tau and may increase the abundance of hyperphosphorylated tau, which is more prone to aggregate into oligomers. This may, in turn, induce more inflammation through the production of more oligomers.",

RAGE is a multi-ligand receptor that binds HMGB1, A\u2424, and advanced glycation end products [56]. It is possible that RAGE may also bind tau oligomers and initiate pro-inflammatory signaling through the RAS, p38, and nuclear factor-B (NFB) pathway [56]. The NFB transcription factor increases the expression of HMGB1 and its receptor RAGE, increasing pro-inflammatory RAGE signaling by a feed-forward mechanism [57,58]. HMGB1 is well established as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which can induce the production of other cytokines through the NFB pathway [59]. Figure 8 illustrates a hypothetical model for these interactions. Tau oligomers may interact with astrocytes and microglia to induce inflammation, potentially through RAGE signaling. This inflammation, in turn, damages neurons resulting in more inflammation. In addition, signaling via the RAGE receptor on the surface of neurons can activate p38, which is known to phosphorylate tau, and may increase the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau.",

It is likely that the appearance of tau oligomers is a late occurrence in FTLD-TDP due to the lack of larger insoluble aggregates of tau in this disease. However, it is also possible that the oligomers are more stable in FTLD-TDP, thus prolonging their toxic longevity and inhibiting the formation of the less-toxic fibrils.

Furthermore, there is promise in the development of non-invasive eye examinations for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, these results can be translated into FTLD and AD, and they indicate that tau oligomers are associated with inflammation. The descriptive results shown here demonstrate a novel association between tau oligomers and inflammation. However, the mechanism and pathways that associate tau oligomers and inflammation need to be elucidated, and this should be a priority for neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration researchers. Moreover, these results suggests that the degeneration of neurons due to chronic inflammation induced by tau oligomers may be inhibited through the combination of anti-tau oligomer and anti-inflammatory therapeutics for the treatment of AD and other tauopathies. This combination would inhibit the proposed feed forward cycle shown in Fig. 8 from two different angles, tau oligomers and inflammatory signaling.",
