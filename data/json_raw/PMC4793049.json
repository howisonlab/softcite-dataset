Fibroblast growth factor 1 was genetically modified to improve its thermal stability and resistance to protease degradation without losing its biological activity. Aim: To study the impact of Q40P/S47I/H93G rFGF-1 on skin cells, its penetration through the skin and the evaluation of the rFGF-1-cosmetic product properties. Material and methods: In vitro studies included the examination of primary fibroblast and keratinocyte viability after the incubation with rFGF-1. The penetration abilities of rFGF-1 in various formulations and carrier systems were examined ex vivo by the Raman spectroscopy. In vivo studies-HF Ultrasound and 3D Imaging System-were used to evaluate the anti-aging properties of creams containing rFGF-1. Results: In vitro studies demonstrated that rFGF-1 strongly enhanced the viability of the treated cells. The Raman Spectroscopy analysis indicated that rFGF-1 encapsulated in lipid spheres penetrate through the stratum corneum to the depth of 60 \u00b5m, and added to the o/w formulation-could penetrate to a depth of 90 \u00b5m. The results obtained from Primos revealed the reduction of the volume and the depth of the wrinkles. Changes in the skin structure in the analyzed areas were evaluated by HF Ultrasonography. Conclusions: Recombinant FGF-1 strongly stimulated fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation. However, the transition of this protein through the SC required an appropriate carrier system-lipid spheres. All tests-in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo-have proved that rFGF-1 is a substance with a potentially wide spectrum of use.",

            "text": "Aging results mainly in the loss of dermal collagen and the accumulation of unorganized collagen and elastin fibers in the dermis, which leads to the appearance of the most common signs of aging, i.e. wrinkles, elastosis and loss of skin tone. Fibroblasts play the key role in wrinkle formation because they produce basic structural skin substances: collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid. These substances provide the skin with appropriate elasticity, tensile strength, firmness (collagen and elastin fibers) and moisturization (hyaluronic acid). During the aging process, the proliferative and metabolic activity of fibroblasts decreases, the fibers' functions are impaired and their structure becomes modified and then destroyed. Some of the biochemical effects of intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging are similar to the formation of a wound [1]. Human growth factors (HGF) play the key role in wound healing and they are important for proper cell functionality [2]. Human growth factors participate in cell division, new cell and blood vessel growth as well as in collagen and elastin production and distribution. They are also involved in the growth and regeneration of many different cells in the body, including fibroblast, liver, vascular, thyroid, ovary and pituitary gland cells. Nowadays, a lot of research is conducted in order to evaluate the usefulness of HGFs in anti-aging treatment.",

The light from the laser was passed through a line filter and focused on a sample mounted on an X-Y-Z translation stage with a 50\u00d7 microscope objective. The Raman-scattered light was collected by the same objective through a holographic notch filter to block out Rayleigh scattering. A 1800 groove/mm grating was used to provide a spectral resolution of 5 cm -1 . The Raman scattering signal was recorded by a 1024 \u00d7 256 pixel RenCam CCD detector. The beam diameter was approximately 2.5 \u00b5m. Typically, the spectra were acquired for 10-30 s, either in a static mode, centering at 1200 cm -1 , or in an extended mode, between 300 and 3400 cm -1 , with the laser power measured at the sample being 5 mW. The spectra were normalized by the laser power and the collection times. This stage of the research was carried out in three phases. Firstly, the determination of the fingerprint (reference spectra) for the recombinant FGF-1 was done. Then, the evaluation of the penetration ability of pure rFGF-1, pure rFGF-1 encapsulated in liposomes and lipid spheres [8], pure rFGF-1 added to standard o/w and w/o emulsions, and finally the composition of rFGF-1 and lipid spheres from o/w and w/o emulsions was carried out. Fingerprints of pure substances were generated at a depth of 15-25 \u00b5m. All samples were applied on skin explants (10 \u00b5l each) from female donors (23-26 years of age) and incubated for 72 h on metal strainers. Those skin explants were used only to investigate the skin system penetration.",

Similar results were observed in the forehead area, where the depth of the wrinkle between the eyebrows decreased by 50.99 \u03bcm ( Table 2). The volume of the nasolabial fold was 21.20 mm 3 before the test, and it decreased to 18.82 mm 3 at the end of the treatment ( Table 2). A similar tendency was observed for the mean value of the volume of the wrinkle between the eyebrows, which was 6.44 mm 3 , whereas after the treatment it decreased to 5.48 mm 3 ( Table 2). The difference of about 0.96 mm 3 was statistically significant for the forehead area, but not for the nasolabial fold, where the difference in the volume was 2.38 mm 3 ( Table 2).",

There are some studies reporting that growth factors are a potent antioxidants that inhibits the aging of skin cells, strengthens its defense processes and reduces wrinkles [1]. Some study reports that growth factors are critical for the proliferation of skin cells like keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Zhang et al. tested fibroblast growth factor-peptide (FGF-P) as a potential mitigator of radiation effects through the proliferation and the barrier function of keratinocytes. Proliferation is critical in maintaining a healthy barrier layer of keratinocytes. As it was proved, radiation reduced MTT activity in a dose-dependent manner, which was reversed by treatment with FGF-P [11]. Similar results were found by Anitua et al. who tested plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF-Endoret) on primary human cells, including keratocytes and conjunctival fibroblasts. In both cell types, the PRGF-Endoret enhanced proliferation [12]. The in vitro studies presented in this publication have demonstrated similar effects on human keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The results showed a strong impact of rFGF-1 on the viability of keratinocytes both from KB and HaCaT lines ( Figure 3) and fibroblasts from donors of different age. rFGF-1 most strongly stimulated the proliferation of L34 and L40 fibroblasts ( Figure 2). These results suggest that it has strong regenerative properties which can be used in cosmetic products.",

Therefore, there is a need to increase or even to allow the migration of both lipophilic and hydrophilic active substances into the skin [15]. For that reason, nowadays the use of nanoand micro-lipid spheres in cosmetology is growing. The lipid-based formulations seem to be the most appropriate ones for the topical application of active substances because they contain physiological and biodegradable lipids which have affinity with the stratum corneum. When applied externally they do not affect its function [16].",

Only rFGF-1 enclosed in lipid spheres passes through the stratum corneum, as evidenced by the presence of bands characteristic for the tested component in the generated spectra (Figure 6). After receiving these results the lipid spheres were selected as the dermal transport system for rFGF-1. As shown in these data the ingredients of o/w formulation could act as enhancers and caused rFGF-1 to penetrate deeper (to a depth of 90 \u03bcm into the skin) than the composition of rFGF-1 and lipid spheres, which migrated to a depth of 60 \u00b5m (Figure 7), what definitely needs further investigation. A feature of lipid particles (lipid spheres) particularly important from a cosmetology point of view is the creation of a discontinuous occlusive layer on the skin's surface. If the particle size is smaller, their adhesion to the skin is stronger and the occlusion is more effective. This reduces transepidermal water loss, thereby increasing the hydration and elasticity of the skin. Occlusion also has a positive impact on the penetration of active substances into the skin. This has been proven for the Coenzyme Q10, which was applied in the form of a suspension of lipid nanoparticles [20].",

For a few of them clinical results available indicate that the topical application of human growth factors provides beneficial effects in reducing the signs of facial skin aging [2,[21][22][23]. In the study conducted by Fitzpatrick and Rostan, the mixture of growth factors, cytokines and soluble matrix proteins secreted by cultured neonatal human fibroblasts reduced fine lines, wrinkles and periorbital photodamage. Measurements of Grenz-zone collagen and epidermal thickness measured from the biopsy showed a 37% increase in Grenz-zone collagen and a 30% increase in epidermal thickness [21]. Similar results were obtained by Gold et al. who tested a proprietary growth factor and cytokine mixture extracted from cultured first trimester fetal human dermal fibroblasts in moisturizing cream on 18 patients for 60 days. The findings revealed an improvement in the average wrinkle score in periorbital (17%) and perioral (13%) areas [23]. The third product contained liposome-encapsulated transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), L-ascorbic acid and black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) extract in a silicone base. The study proved an improvement in the wrinkle score for TGF-\u03b21-containing cream as compared to cream with only L-ascorbic and black cohosh extract [22]. All the cited studies are similar to the results of our in vivo tests. The instrumental assay provided evidence that the 4-week use of 2 products with the composition of rFGF-1 and lipid spheres (for day and for night) decreases both the volume and the depth of the measured wrinkles (Table 2). Moreover, the exami-nation made by high frequency ultrasound (HFU) demonstrated changes in the structure of the skin, which may be caused by collagen restoration and better hydration of the tested areas. However, there were dissimilarities depending on the location of measurements. The better results obtained at the nasolabial fold may be caused by the differences in the thickness of the skin, which is thicker on the forehead and thus hinders the penetration of active ingredients.",

Active substances such as exogenous growth factors may be used as a strategy to attenuate the signs of aging.

All tests -in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo -confirmed that Q40P/S47I/H93G rFGF-1 is a substance with a potentially wide spectrum of use in cosmetology and wound healing.",
