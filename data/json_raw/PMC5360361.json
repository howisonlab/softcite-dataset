            "text": "Oxidative stress-induced cell injury has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Morroniside is an antioxidant derived from the Chinese herb Shan-Zhu-Yu. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effect of morroniside against hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2)-induced cell death in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. H 2 O 2 increased cell apoptosis, as determined by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining. This effect was reversed by pretreatment with morroniside at concentrations of 1-100 \u00b5M. The increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation induced by H 2 O 2 was also abrogated by morroniside. H 2 O 2 induced a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, increased caspase-3 activity, and caused downregulation of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and upregulation of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression. These effects were blocked by morroniside pretreatment. Thus, morroniside protects human neuroblastoma cells against oxidative damage by inhibiting ROS production while suppressing Bax and stimulating Bcl-2 expression, thereby blocking mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate that morroniside has therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."

In most situations, ROS produced through metabolic processes are quenched by intracellular defense systems, including SOD (33). Previous studies have shown that depletion of cellular glutathione leads to accumulation of ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction (34). We found here that morroniside treatment increased SOD activity in the SK-N-SH cells, which prevented ROS accumulation. Thus, we propose that the cytoprotective effects of morroniside are associated with its antioxidant capacity, for which, antioxidants such as glutathione or SOD are indispensable.",

ROS target mitochondrial membrane proteins, leading to activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which decreases the MMP (36) and releases cytochrome c into the cytosol, where it binds to apoptotic protease activating factor 1 and forms the apoptosome, which activates pro-apoptotic caspases (37). Indeed, we observed that H 2 O 2 treatment reduced the MMP and activated the pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3. These effects were blocked by pretreatment with morroniside, suggesting that morroniside exerts protective effects by blocking the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. H 2 O 2 has been reported to modulate the levels of Bcl-2 and Bax, two genes associated with mitochondrial apoptosis, in various cell types including cortical neurons (30), endothelial Figure 9.

This was observed in our study at both the mRNA and protein levels following administration of H 2 O 2 for 24 h. Moreover, morroniside treatment reversed the changes in Bcl-2 and Bax expression induced by H 2 O 2 . The pro-apoptotic protein Bax is activated during apoptosis, and its relocation from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial outer membrane leads to formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and downstream events. Bax accumulated in the mitochondrial outer membrane binds to the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and maintains it in an inactive state (37). Bcl-2 also acts as an antioxidant by suppressing ROS levels and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (40). Taken together, these findings suggest that morroniside blocks mitochondrial apoptosis via modulation of Bcl-2 and Bax expression.",
