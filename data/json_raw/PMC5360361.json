            "text": "Oxidative stress-induced cell injury has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Morroniside is an antioxidant derived from the Chinese herb Shan-Zhu-Yu. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effect of morroniside against hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2)-induced cell death in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. H 2 O 2 increased cell apoptosis, as determined by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining. This effect was reversed by pretreatment with morroniside at concentrations of 1-100 \u00b5M. The increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation induced by H 2 O 2 was also abrogated by morroniside. H 2 O 2 induced a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, increased caspase-3 activity, and caused downregulation of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and upregulation of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression. These effects were blocked by morroniside pretreatment. Thus, morroniside protects human neuroblastoma cells against oxidative damage by inhibiting ROS production while suppressing Bax and stimulating Bcl-2 expression, thereby blocking mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate that morroniside has therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

ROS target mitochondrial membrane proteins, leading to activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which decreases the MMP (36) and releases cytochrome c into the cytosol, where it binds to apoptotic protease activating factor 1 and forms the apoptosome, which activates pro-apoptotic caspases (37). Indeed, we observed that H 2 O 2 treatment reduced the MMP and activated the pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3. These effects were blocked by pretreatment with morroniside, suggesting that morroniside exerts protective effects by blocking the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. H 2 O 2 has been reported to modulate the levels of Bcl-2 and Bax, two genes associated with mitochondrial apoptosis, in various cell types including cortical neurons (30), endothelial Figure 9.

This was observed in our study at both the mRNA and protein levels following administration of H 2 O 2 for 24 h. Moreover, morroniside treatment reversed the changes in Bcl-2 and Bax expression induced by H 2 O 2 . The pro-apoptotic protein Bax is activated during apoptosis, and its relocation from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial outer membrane leads to formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and downstream events. Bax accumulated in the mitochondrial outer membrane binds to the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and maintains it in an inactive state (37). Bcl-2 also acts as an antioxidant by suppressing ROS levels and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (40). Taken together, these findings suggest that morroniside blocks mitochondrial apoptosis via modulation of Bcl-2 and Bax expression.",

However, pretreatment with morroniside attenuated the H 2 O 2 -induced decrease in cell survival in a dose-dependent manner, with the greatest effect observed at 10 \u00b5M (Fig. 2C). Morroniside reverses H 2 O 2 -induced morphological changes. SK-N-SH cells treated for 24 h with 200 \u00b5M H 2 O 2 showed morphological changes including loss of cell projections; a round, swollen, or shrunken cell body; and aggregation. These changes were blocked by pretreatment with morroni- side (Fig. 2D). Morroniside inhibits H 2 O 2 -induced LDH release. The LDH release assay showed that H 2 O 2 increased LDH activity in the supernatant of the SK-N-SH cell cultures relative to the control group. This effect was suppressed upon treatment with 1, 10 and 100 \u00b5M morroniside (P<0.05) (Fig. 2E). Morroniside protects SK-N-SH cells from H 2 O 2 -induced apop- tosis.
