Estimates of the incidence and risk factors contributing to sudden death vary widely. The Sudden Unexpected Death in North Carolina (SUDDEN) project is a population-based investigation of the incidence and potential causes of sudden death. Methods: From 3 March 2013 to 2 March 2014, all out-of-hospital deaths in Wake County, North Carolina, were screened to identify presumed sudden unexpected death among free-living residents between the ages of 18 and 64 years. Death certificate, public and medical records were reviewed and adjudicated to confirm sudden unexpected death cases. Results: Following adjudication, 190 sudden unexpected deaths including 122 men and 68 women were identified. Estimated incidence was 32.1 per 100 000 person-years overall: 42.7 among men and 22.4 among women. The majority of victims were white, unmarried men over age 55 years, with unwitnessed deaths at home. Hypertension and dyslipidaemia were common in men and women. African-American women dying from sudden unexpected death were over-represented. Women who were under age 55 years with coronary disease accounted for over half of female participants with coronary artery disease. Conclusions: The overall estimated incidence of sudden unexpected death may account for approximately 10% of all deaths classified as 'natural'. Women have a lower estimated incidence of sudden unexpected death than men. However, we found no major differences in age or comorbidities between men and women. African-Americans and young women with coronary disease are at risk for sudden unexpected death.",

Only 1.5% of participants were both married and had a witnessed death, and there were significantly fewer married participants compared to all Wake County residents deceased in 2013 (33% vs 44%, p<0.01). This supports the observation that marriage is a protective factor from sudden death. The association between marriage and sudden death has been described previously, specifically that marriage had beneficial health effects for unemployed women by providing an alternative source of financial resources and social support. 13 Within our cohort, African-Americans, especially males, accounted for a higher proportion of the study population over the age of 55 years; whites, especially women, accounted for a higher proportion of the population aged 55 years and under. Different racial make-up of older and younger age groups within our sample suggests that older age as a predictor for sudden death may be modified by race. African-Americans were over-represented in the cohort compared to the living population in Wake County (35% vs 21%), which is partially accounted for by a significant excess of African-American women compared to living Wake County residents (43% vs 23%, p<0.001). Most participants had hypertension, with dyslipidaemia, smoking and BMI >30 kg/m 2 , and diabetes was also present in more than 30% of the cohort.

Overlapping definitions of sudden death have contributed to variability in reported incidence rates and have impeded the study of sudden death aetiology  and risk factors. 16 17 The WHO's definition of sudden death focuses on sudden cardiac death, sudden cardiac arrest and SUD. Their definition describes sudden death as a witnessed sudden, unexpected death within 1 h of symptom onset or within 24 h of having been observed alive and symptom free. 18 Although this definition is broad in defining the circumstances of death, studies that use the full definition, including the time restrictions, are prone to systematic exclusion of many victims. It may be 'more meaningful to define the specific characteristics surrounding cardiac arrest, and register and collect data in a standardised way, than to try to define the word 'sudden' in the context of death'. 6 18 Previous studies may have underestimated the incidence of SUD by systematic exclusion of people likely to die an unwitnessed death at an unknown time at home.",

We found more women dying of sudden death compared to previous studies. This might be explained by differences in case ascertainment and selection methods. 19 20 Death certificate data inconsistent with medical records We found frequent and important discrepancies in the death certificates compared to medical records. For example, there were no cases of substance abuse listed on the death certificate. However, toxicology screens were positive in 31% of medical examiner cases. CAD seemed over-represented in older particiapants. Coding inconsistencies are important issues as they can significantly impact estimates of disease incidence and resource allocation. 21 In the Framingham Heart Study, 26-year follow-up of men and women aged 35-84 years indicated that CAD morbidity was twice as high in men as in women, and 60% of coronary events occurred in men. 22 The onset of symptomatic CAD is typically about 10 years earlier in men, but CAD incidence in women increases rapidly at menopause. 22 Analysis by age and coronary disease using medical records and medical examiner data in our cohort shows that women under age 55 years have more coronary disease than men of the same age. Most men with coronary disease were over the age of 55 years. This finding is inconsistent with previous research showing a growing risk of cardiovascular disease in older women. 23 This suggests that coronary disease is a risk factor for SUD in younger women. However, the opposite result is seen when using death certificate data. As previously discussed, this may suggest inaccuracy in documentation on death certificates. Sudden death is not just a disease of men but may have great impact on younger women.",
