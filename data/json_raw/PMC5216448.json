            "text": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in a unique microenvironment within the central nervous system (CNS) called the NSC niche. Although they are relatively rare, niches have been previously characterized in both the brain and spinal cord of adult animals. Recently, another potential NSC niche has been identified in the filum terminale (FT), which is a thin band of tissue at the caudal end of the spinal cord. While previous studies have demonstrated that NSCs can be isolated from the FT, the in vivo architecture of this tissue and its relation to other NSC niches in the CNS has not yet been established. In this article we report a histological analysis of the FT NSC niche in postnatal rats and humans. Immunohistochemical characterization reveals that the FT is mitotically active and its cells express similar markers to those in other CNS niches. In addition, the organization of the FT most closely resembles that of the adult spinal cord niche.",

            "text": "The filum terminale (FT) is a thin band of tissue that connects the spinal cord to the periosteum of the coccyx. It is present in all vertebrates and has been studied in a variety of species, including frogs, cats, rodents, and humans (Gamble, 1971;Nakayama, 1976;Gonzalez-Robles and Glusman, 1979;Chesler and Nicholson, 1985;Rethelyi et al., 2004;Boros et al., 2008). Although it is continuous with the spinal cord, the FT has a unique developmental history, which involves regression from a differentiated state to that of a more primitive tissue. Early in development, the FT is a fully differentiated section of the spinal cord that innervates the embryonic tail and is complete with nerve roots and associated dorsal root ganglia. As development progresses and the tail is absorbed, the FT undergoes a process that Streeter (1919) termed \"dedifferentiation,\" which results in a tissue that appears to have regressed to an earlier developmental state (Kunitomo, 1918;Streeter, 1919;Tarlov, 1938). The postnatal FT is completely vestigial and expendable. It is not interconnected with the central nervous system (CNS) and does not participate in nervous control of the organism. It is routinely sectioned to treat Tethered Cord syndrome, which is a condition characterized by the abnormal attachment of tissue limiting the movement of the spinal cord within the vertebral column (Bakker-Niezen et al., 1984;Nakamura, 1984;Lad et al., 2007). Consequently, the FT is a potential source of autologous cells for cell replacement strategies.",

First, we determined whether the FT was mitotically active and which cell types were involved. We then focused on the presence of the different classes of niche cells, their morphology and location, and the degree to which they expressed multiple markers. Finally, we examined the organization of the FT at four developmental timepoints.

In transverse sections, EdU 1 nuclei were observed at a high frequency in both the ependymal zone and the subependymal zone. At 4 hours postinjection, the majority of EdU 1 cells existed singly.

First, we assessed Nestin immunoreactivity. Nestin, a marker of undifferentiated neural progenitor cells, has been detected in all previously described NSC niches. Many of the EdU 1 nuclei in the FT colocalized with Nestin. These double-labeled cells were distributed throughout the FT and were particularly prominent in the subependymal zone ( Fig. 1C; n 5 3). Because radial glia have been shown to play an integral role in the stem cell niche in the SVZ, the presence of this cell type among the proliferating cells in the FT was also examined using the selective marker 3CB2 (Prada et al., 1995). Although EdU 1 nuclei were often found in close association with 3CB2 1 processes, difficulty in identifying 3CB2 1 cell bodies made it difficult to discern whether the processes originated from the somas of dividing cells ( Fig. 1D; n 5 3). Olig-2 is a marker that is expressed by niche cells in both the SVZ and the spinal cord. In the SVZ, Olig-2 labels Type C transit amplifying cells, but in the spinal cord niche, it is instead a marker for oligodendrocyte and motor neuron progenitors (Menn et al., 2006;Hamilton et al., 2009). While we observed extensive Olig-2 staining, only on very rare occasions was EdU seen to colocalize with Olig-2 ( Fig. 1E; n 5 3). Finally, we determined whether any cells coexpress EdU and GFAP. GFAP, a marker of differentiated astrocytes, is also expressed in the SVZ by the quiescent stem cell population (Type B Cells) . In the SVZ, GFAP 1 cells (either differentiated astrocytes or Type B cells) are found in the subependymal zone and have been shown to act as postnatal NSCs. We detected a small number of GFAP 1 /EdU 1 cells, which were located in the subependymal zone and exhibited a highly branched morphology ( Fig. 1F; n 5 3).",

As a thymidine analog, EdU is incorporated into the DNA of a dividing cell during the S-phase of mitosis. Ki67, on the other hand, is a marker for proliferation that is present in all cells during active phases of the cell cycle. To identify any slow-cycling progenitors in the FT, P2 rats were subcutaneously injected with 5 mg/ml EdU (n 5 12), and then a group of these EdU-labeled rats was sacrificed at each of the following timepoints postinjection: 2 hours (n 5 4), 3 days (n 5 4), and 7 days (n 5 4). Transverse sections were first labeled with Ki67 followed by fluorescent detection of the EdU-labeled cells.

These cells were always located in the subependymal zone and infrequently projected an apical process toward the lumen of the central canal. GFAP 1 fibers were noted to wind through the ependymal zone, ultimately contacting the lumen of the central canal (Fig. 3A). Rarely, GFAP 1 cell bodies were located directly in the ependymal zone (Fig. 3B). These cells appeared to send out long basal processes that often spanned the entire diameter of the FT and ultimately reached the pial surface. Whole-mount staining revealed that there was also a prominent level of GFAP staining among cells with a more superficial location ( Fig. 5A). Interestingly, GFAP reactivity occurred homogeneously throughout the FT just below the level of the conus but restricted itself to the ventral half more caudally, and this transition occurred in the rostral third of the tissue (Fig. 3C).",

Sections of FT were stained for Nestin, 3CB2, GFAP, and Olig-2 at stages P1 (n 5 16), P10 (n 5 12), and rats aged >P82 (n 5 4). Additionally, the P5 FT was examined in whole mount. All markers remained present in the tissue throughout the entire age range. However, the architecture of the niche changed over time, as revealed by a modification in the frequency of appearance, intensity, and morphology of stained cells (Fig. 7). The number of Nestin 1 processes and intensity of staining decreased with age ( Fig. 7A,1-3). Furthermore, the morphology of the Nestin 1 cells changed throughout development. In P1 rats, Nestin expression was observed in immature, radial glial-like processes that spanned the distance from the ependymal zone to the pial surface, and there was a higher density of processes at both the dorsal and ventral poles of the central canal ependymal and subependymal zones (Fig. 7A,1). By P10, the intensity of Nestin staining had decreased, especially in the ventral zone, and the strongest staining occurred in cell bodies in the region of the dorsal pole of the central canal (Figs.  4A,B, 7A,2). In aged rats, a small number of cells retained Nestin reactivity; however, these cells often lost contact with the pial surface while maintaining contact with the central canal (Fig. 7A,3).",

GFAP reactivity was observed in only a small number of radial processes in P1 pups (Fig. 7C,1). This staining increased with age, and by P10 GFAP 1 processes had significantly increased in number and complexity of shape. Additionally, as noted earlier, these processes were more abundant in the ventral FT (Fig. 7C,2). In the adult, GFAP reactivity was abundant throughout the FT, and processes were highly branched (Fig. 7C,3). In contrast to the other markers, the pattern of Olig-2 reactivity remained consistent throughout development (Fig. 7D), with Olig-2 1 cells dispersed throughout the FT, including both the ependymal and subependymal zones.",

GFAP 1 cells were observed in the subependymal zone and were dispersed more laterally throughout the FT. Their processes projected both radially and longitudinally (Fig. 8B). When sections were examined for colocalization of GFAP and Nestin, we detected a small proportion of cells and processes that were double-labeled and sometimes colocalized with GFAP.

The numbers and morphologies of these cells along with the niche characteristics change with the age of the animal. For P10 and younger, the GFAP 1 and Nestin 1 cells represent separate populations, with the GFAP 1 cells located more ventrally and the Nestin 1 cells biased dorsally. At this stage, there is a high degree of costaining for Nestin and 3CB2, suggesting that the Nestin 1 cells are radial glia. Interestingly, the Nestin 1 cells extend their processes the entire diameter of the FT and maintain contact with the lumen of the central canal. This is reminiscent of NSCs that have been described in other In transverse section, a higher concentration of Nestin staining (red) in the dorsal region of the FT was evident. Dorsal and ventral are indicated by lower case letters. C: Longitudinal section, 3CB2 1 processes (red) exhibited radial morphology along the longitudinal axis of the FT. D: Transverse section, Olig-2 (red), a marker of motor neuron and oligodendrocyte precursors, occurred mostly in the subependymal region but also in rare nuclei located directly in the ependymal zone (arrow).

The overall organization of the FT niche (Fig. 9) is similar to that described for the spinal cord (Hamilton et al., 2009;Hugnot and Franzen, 2011;Marichal et al., 2012). This is not unreasonable, given that the FT is a vestigial form of the spinal cord and might be expected to have a corresponding organization (Streeter, 1919).",

Harmeier observed that the FT contained all the elements found in the spinal cord, including ependymal cells, neurons, and glia. In addition, he noted the presence of neuroblasts scattered throughout the tissue and a high density of small blood vessels. Tarlov confirmed these findings, and he also noted the presence of many small neurons, which he thought likely to be neuroblasts. In addition, he noted the absence of anterior horn cells; he observed astrocytes in close association with blood vessels; he noted the presence of oligodendrocytes; and he described amorphous clusters of cells. His summary diagram bears a striking resemblance to modern descriptions of the NSC niche (Tarlov, 1938). These human studies were extended by Choi et al. (1992) using electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. They noted GFAP 1 glial cells, NSE 1 neurons, and Vimentin 1 precursor cells. They also noted large clusters of peri-ependymal glial cells that formed acinar-like structures. Miller (1968) used electron microscopy to characterize the ependymal cells and the neuropil of the FT in both cats and monkeys (Miller, 1968). The frog FT has been studied by three groups (Gonzalez-Robles and Glusman, 1979;Chesler and Nicholson, 1985;Chvatal et al., 2001). Using light and electron microscopy, Gonzalez-Robles and Glusman (1979) identified three regions of the FT: a central region that contains ependymal and subependymal cells, an intermediate zone where astrocytes predominate, and a peripheral zone that contains neuronal fibers astrocyte processes. Chesler and Nicholson (1985) elaborated on this, describing a radial arrangement of the FT organized around the central canal. In addition, they noted the presence of TH 1 CSF-contacting neurons abutting the central canal. Chavatal's group (2001) confirmed the presence of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes using immunocytochemistry for GFAP and Rip staining, respectively. They also identified neurons using electrophysiology followed by dye-filling (Chvatal et al., 2001). A similar organization of cellular elements around the central canal has also been observed in the FT of rabbits, guinea pigs, and rats by Nakayama (1976).",

Here, we add a fourth location to the list, the FT. Although these four niches all share many key features, their subcellular organization also contains some distinct elements. Previous studies have described the localization of cells that express GFAP, Nestin, and Olig-2 along with proliferating cells in the various NSC niches. Unsurprisingly, given its developmental origins, the expression pattern of these markers in the FT niche is most similar to the previously described SC niche in adult animals. For example, proliferating cells were observed in these two niches in both the ependymal and subependymal layers, and the proliferating cells primarily expressed Nestin, with few GFAP 1 proliferating cells being identified in either case (Hamilton et al., 2009). Nestin 1 cells are also similarly distributed in the SC and FT niches. In the SC niche, Nestin 1 cells are located dorsally and have long, basally projecting processes (Hamilton et al., 2009). Similarly, in FT, we observed a dorsal bias of Nestin 1 cells that extend processes to span the entire diameter of the FT. Additionally, Nestin expression appears to be downregulated in all regions of the SC by age P6 (Barry and McDermott, 2005), which corresponds to our observation in the FT that the intensity of Nestin staining decreased by P10 and was only retained in a small number of cells in aged rats.",

Marker analyses can sometimes be misleading because many antigens are expressed by multiple cell types, and the presence of a marker does not necessarily dictate the function of that cell. For example, GFAP is commonly used to identify astrocytes, but it is also expressed by adult NSCs, including the quiescent stem cell population (Type B cells) in the SVZ (Alvarez-Buylla and Garcia-Verdugo, 2002). Similarly, the nuclear transcription factor Olig-2 is involved in regulating progenitor cell fate of both SC oligodendrocytes and motor neurons. Therefore, conclusive identification of a cell type using a single marker can be problematic. To combat this, we looked for colocalization of markers whenever possible. For example, the coexpression of Nestin and 3CB2 in a single cell suggests that these cells are most likely radial glial neural progenitors.",

For example, we and others have noted Dlx2 expression in the FT (Varghese et al., 2009;Jha et al., 2013b). Because this marker is normally restricted to the forebrain's stem cell niche (Bulfone et al., 1993), it will be important to establish the identity of the FT neurons produced in terms of their anterior-posterior identity. We are currently investigating this by examining HOX gene expression in the FT (Jessell, 2000). An additional level of complexity is introduced by our lack of understanding of the functionality of the FT in postnatal animals. In the SVZ stem cell niche, adult neurogenesis is known to occur in a stepwise fashion and to contribute to the continuous production of interneurons destined for the olfactory bulb. In that niche, Olig-2 is expressed by a subpopulation of cells that has been identified as transit-amplifying progenitors (Type C cells), which are named for their properties of proliferation and differentiation within a finite life span. In contrast, the fate of the NCS in the SC and FT is still not established. Consequently, identifying distinct functional populations of cells based on markers alone is not possible. One possibility is that the FT cells are destined to migrate into the spinal cord and differentiate into motor neurons. In that case, Olig-2 might play a role in determining their fate as motor neurons. However, it is equally possible that these cells remain relatively quiescent and do not continuously generate new neurons, which would require an alternate explanation for Olig-2 expression. Further studies are needed to construct a functional map of the FT and determine the fate of the cells contained within this structure before any markerbased subpopulations can be conclusively named.",

These components not only contribute to the health of the niche cells by delivering nutrients and anchoring cells to the niche, but they can also influence stem cell fates through diffusible signals and/or direct contact. Therefore, careful characterization of the ECM and the surrounding vasculature in the FT will be a necessary component of a more complete description of the niche.",
