            "text": "Most current superresolution (SR) microscope techniques surpass the diffraction limit at the expense of temporal resolution, compromising their applications to live-cell imaging. Here we describe a new SR fluorescence microscope based on confocal microscope optics, which we name the spinning disk superresolution microscope (SDSRM). Theoretically, the SDSRM is equivalent to a structured illumination microscope (SIM) and achieves a spatial resolution of 120 nm, double that of the diffraction limit of wide-field fluorescence microscopy. However, the SDSRM is 10 times faster than a conventional SIM because SR signals are recovered by optical demodulation through the stripe pattern of the disk. Therefore a single SR image requires only a single averaged image through the rotating disk. On the basis of this theory, we modified a commercial spinning disk confocal microscope. The improved resolution around 120 nm was confirmed with biological samples. The rapid dynamics of microtubules, mitochondria, lysosomes, and endosomes were observed with temporal resolutions of 30-100 frames/s. Because our method requires only small optical modifications, it will enable an easy upgrade from an existing spinning disk confocal to a SR microscope for live-cell imaging."

Superresolution (SR) techniques, such as photoactivatable localization microscopy (PALM; Betzig et al., 2006), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM; Rust et al., 2006), and stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED; Hell and Wichmann, 1994), can extend the resolution down to \u226450 nm, but usually at the expense of image acquisition time. Therefore their applications are rather limited to fixed specimens. In living cells, some cellular structures, such as endosomes and other vesicles, move at velocities >3 \u03bcm/s (Allen et al., 1982). Thus the image acquisition time needs to be <<30 ms for 100-nm-resolution imaging.",

Recently an improved implementation of MSIM, termed instant SIM, was reported (York et al., 2013).

SR signals between f c \u2032 and f c + f 0 are buried in the noise and need statistical estimation for recovery with an algorithm such as Richardson-Lucy deconvolution (York et al., 2012). Instead, we designed the stripe pattern as w = 80 nm and p = 270 nm on the sample plane to increase the SR signals. This parameter is close to the theoretical maximum (w/p = 0.35) and increases the SR signal more than five times the conventional CF stripe pattern.

Thus the same confocal mask pattern serves as both modulator and demodulator, and frequencyshifted SR signals are already returned to the original position optically. Although this optical configuration is the same as the conventional line confocal (CF) microscope, the design of the stripe pattern is different. In conventional CF, p is much larger than w to minimize cross-talk (Shimozawa et al., 2013).

Conventional SIM requires several modulated images to retrieve SR components by demodulation in the Fourier space, but it has higher photon efficiency because the signal is retrieved without a mask. In contrast, the confocal aperture works as a mask to demodulate the SR components in the confocal microscope. To obtain stronger SR component signals, a smaller confocal aperture is required. However, this comes at the expense of signal intensity because with a smaller confocal aperture, most of the photons from the sample are rejected at the confocal aperture. Here we overcome this problem by specially designing the mask pattern on the disk. The opening was narrowed to \u03bb/5 while keeping the aperture ratio as 30%. This aperture ratio is more than three times higher than for the conventional spinning disk confocal, and this high light throughput enabled 100-Hz SR imaging with moderate excitation power (20-40 W/cm 2 )."

            "text": "Finally, we applied the SDSRM for the imaging of recently reported but poorly characterized organelles, mitochondrionderived vesicles (MDVs). They are proposed to be formed by budding of the mitochondria outer membrane and to mediate the transport of damaged proteins from mitochondria to peroxisomes (Neuspiel et al., 2008). However, it has been difficult to examine the structure and dynamics of the outer membrane of mitochondria due to the limited resolution of light microscopy. We therefore examined the mitochondrial outer membrane first by staining with anti-TOMM20 antibody (Figure 7). The lumen of the mitochondria is barely visible with conventional WF imaging but is clearly observed with SDSRM as well as STED ( Figure 7D). Unexpectedly, the SR image of mitochondrial outer membrane showed that the size of the lumen of mitochondria is highly variable even in a single cell. We also found thin protrusions from thick mitochondria. Only the outer membrane is apparently protruded, and the lumen is thin and unclear even with the STED SR image ( Figure 7E). In addition to the mitochondria and the thin protrusions, many vesicular or tubular structures were also stained with TOMM20 antibody. They would correspond to MDVs as reported previously (Neuspiel et al., 2008). We next expressed TOMM20-mEmerald and used the SDSRM with exposure 30 ms and excitation 20 W/cm 2 . The 120-nm-resolution live imaging at video rate with SDSRM enabled us to observe not only the mitochondrial fusion event, but also the rapid dynamics of MDVs (Figure 8 and Supplemental Movie S4). The protrusions of the outer membrane were highly dynamic: elongating, shrinking, first visualization of MDV formation from mitochondrial protrusions. The frame rate of our system is mainly limited by the rotation speed of the disk (1800 rpm), which would be possible to accelerate 10 times to achieve a frame rate of 1 kHz. This would enable imaging of rapid processes such as neurotransmitter release at the synapse (S\u00fcdhof, 2013) In summary, the spinning disk confocal-based implementation of SIM described here is easy to implement and robust to use. An existing spinning disk confocal can easily be upgraded. Thus we hope that this method will not only open the way for SR live-cell imaging with high temporal resolution, but also help to popularize SR microscopy.",

A combination of a cooled CCD (CoolSNAP HQ) and a mercury lamp with a light guide (U-HGLGPS, Olympus; not shown in Figure 2A) was used for the initial experiments (Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure S3). The light source was then replaced with a laser (Sapphire488HP; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) and a Even with the high-light-throughput disk pattern, stronger excitation light was required than for typical fluorescence live-cell imaging. Twice-better resolution in two dimensions means one-fourth signal intensity per pixel, and only 30% of the signal passes through the disk to reach the camera. Thus an at least 12-times stronger signal is required. Furthermore, even higher signal-to-noise ratio is required than for conventional WF imaging because the weak SR components are enhanced by high-pass filtering, which can also enhance the noise. In this study, therefore, most of the images were acquired with excitation light intensity of 20-40 W/cm 2 , which is nearly 100 times stronger than for typical fluorescence live-cell imaging (0.1-1 W/cm 2 ). Note, however, that this excitation beam light intensity is comparable to that for typical SIM imaging and >100 times weaker than for STED. Furthermore, the excitation light intensity can be further reduced for light-sensitive samples by elongating the exposure time, although the temporal resolution is compromised.",

            "text": "As applications of live-cell SR imaging, we observed the dynamics of microtubules, lysosomes, recycling endosomes, and mitochondria. The short exposure time (<30 ms) enabled SR live imaging without motion blur, and the fine structures of rapidly moving organelles were captured, such as the fusion and fission events of the outer membrane of mitochondria and the rapid dynamics of mitochondrial protrusions and MDVs. To our knowledge, this is the  (yellow, E). Black, red, and blue curves show conventional WF, SDSRM, and STED, respectively. WF (A) and SDSRM (B) images were taken with a 60\u00d7/NA 1.3 silicone oil immersion objective (UPLSAPO60XS); STED images (C) were taken with a 100\u00d7/NA 1.40 objective (HC PL APO 100\u00d7/1.40 OIL STED WHITE; Leica). SDSRM and STED images were postprocessed by deconvolution (CMLE, Huygens) to reduce noise and enhance contrast. Bar, 5 \u03bcm. The disk-scanning unit has a spinning disk and a filter-set wheel changer. The spinning disk is put on the primary image plane for confocal imaging. The disk was made by using electron lithography on a low-reflection chrome coat that covered a fused silica substrate (DU-DSR1-SP; Olympus). The width and the pitch of the confocal slit apertures were 80 and 270 nm, respectively, as discussed in the main text.",
