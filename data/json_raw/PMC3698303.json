Methods: We obtained 401 pairs of duplicate nasal swabs from 321 patients. One swab was suspended overnight in tryptic soy broth; 50-\u00b5L aliquots of suspension were inoculated on the three chromogenic media. Brilliance agar I and II were examined after 24 hr, and ChromID MRSA, after 24 and 48 hr. The paired swab was processed directly using realtime PCR-based Xpert MRSA assay. Results: True positives, designated as MRSA growth in any of the culture media, were detected with the prevalence of 17% in our institution. We report the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MRSA growth as follows: 92.3%, 94.0%, 75.9%, and 98.4% in Brilliance agar I (24 hr); 92.7%, 97.9%, 90.0%, and 98.5% in Brilliance agar II (24 hr); 95.6%, 95.8%, 82.3%, and 99.1% in ChromID MRSA (24 hr); 100%, 92.5%, 73.1%, and 100% in ChromID MRSA (48 hr); 92.6%, 96.7%, 85.1%, and 98.5% in Xpert MRSA assay. The agreement between the enriched culture and Xpert MRSA assay was 96.0%. Conclusions: Three chromogenic culture media combined with enrichment and Xpert MRSA assay demonstrated similar capabilities in MRSA detection. The Xpert MRSA assay yielded results comparable to those of culture methods, saving 48-72 hr, thus facilitating earlier detection of MRSA in healthcare settings.",

Patients carrying MRSA are at a greater risk for developing an S. aureus infection, compared with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus www.annlabmed.org http://dx.doi.org/10.3343/alm.2013.33. 4.255 (MSSA)-colonized or non-colonized patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) [2]. Active surveillance and isolation policy have been recommended for controlling the spread of MRSA in healthcare facilities [3]. In Korea, S. aureus is the second most common isolate (16.6%) among hospital isolates, and the methicillin-resistance rate of S. aureus was about 69%, according to the 2009 KONSAR study [4]. A timely, affordable, and reliable screening method for MRSA is essential to improve hospital infection control, and there is a continued debate about the turnaround time, cost per test, and cost benefit.",

The assaycan detect, within only 2 hr, strains with all SCCmec types, including SCCmec I, II, III, IVa, V, and VI found in healthcare-acquired (HA) and community-acquired (CA) MRSA [7,8]. Currently, various selective and differential chromogenic media are available that allow direct colony color-based identification of the pathogen from the primary culture 18-24 hr after incubation. However, broth enrichment and incubation for 48 hr are necessary to increase the detection sensitivity, especially in cases with low bacterial density [9,10].",

            "text": "24.6). These findings are in line with the previous studies showing that the discrepancies between the Xpert MRSA assay and culture method occurred exclusively when the bacterial density was low [9] and agree with the fact that the CT value in the Xpert MRSA assay correlates strongly with the bacterial density in the samples [9,14]. The discordance from the five false-negative results might be partially explained by the cases with low bacterial density of MRSA in the nostrils or disparity in the specimens from two nostrils ( Table 2). The reason for the one discrepancy of a sample yielding culture-negative and PCR-positive results, even in the repeated test using the remaining enrichment TSB, might be the fact that SCC elements lacking the functional mecA gene can be detected by the Xpert MRSA assay, because it does not specifically target the mecA gene [5]. Another explanation for the one culture-negative and PCR-positive sample is the limitation in the experimental design for S. aureus strains that may require anaerobic incubation [15]. There was no difference in the detection rates of SCCmec types among chromogenic agars and Xpert MRSA assay. The majority of the isolates were SCCmec type II that is known as HA-MRSA clone [12], followed by SCCmec type IV that is emerging as a CA-MRSA clone in Korea [16,17].",

The Xpert MRSA assay could give results comparable to culture methods within 1 hr.
