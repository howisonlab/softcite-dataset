            "text": "Self-management is becoming increasingly important in COPD health care although it remains difficult to embed self-management into routine clinical care. The implementation of self-management is understood as a complex interaction at the level of patient, health care provider (HCP), and health system. Nonetheless there is still a poor understanding of the barriers and effective facilitators. Comprehension of these determinants can have significant implications in optimizing self-management implementation and give further directions for the development of self-management interventions. Data were collected among COPD patients (N=46) and their HCPs (N=11) in three general practices and their collaborating affiliated hospitals. Mixed methods exploration of the data was conducted and collected by interviews, video-recorded consultations (N=50), and questionnaires on consultation skills. Influencing determinants were monitored by 1) interaction and communication between the patient and HCP, 2) visible and invisible competencies of both the patient and the HCP, and 3) degree of embedding self-management into the health care system. Video observations showed little emphasis on effective behavioral change and follow-up of given lifestyle advice during consultation. A strong presence of COPD assessment and monitoring negatively affects the patient-centered communication. Both patients and HCPs experience difficulties in defining personalized goals. The satisfaction of both patients and HCPs concerning patient centeredness during consultation was measured by the patient feedback questionnaire on consultation skills. The patients scored high (84.3% maximum score) and differed from the HCPs (26.5% maximum score). Although the patient-centered approach accentuating self-management is one of the dominant paradigms in modern medicine, our observations show several influencing determinants causing difficulties in daily practice implementation. This research is a first step unravelling the determinants of self-management leading to a better understanding.",

            "text": "According to the World Health Organization, COPD is listed among the top three leading causes of death in 2030. 1 COPD is currently ranked sixth in the Dutch mortality ranking list. 2,3 Because of the aging population, it is expected that the number of COPD patients will increase by 38% between 2005 and 2025. 4 Apart from the expected loss in both years of life and health-related quality of life among many patients, this development influences both the accessibility and affordability of COPD care. Consequently, self-management is becoming increasingly more important, 5 referring to the individual's ability to manage symptoms, treatment, physical and psychosocial consequences, and lifestyle changes inherent in living with a chronic disease. 6 Over the last decade, an increase is seen in general practice-based nurse specialists, improving consultation to chronic care patients, transferring knowledge of lifestyle awareness and optimized prevention. 7 Furthermore, a variety of (e-health) interventions and tools are available for COPD patients, supporting in handling symptoms, maintenance of physical functioning, and medical management. 8 These self-management interventions are understood as all programs and techniques enabling patients to assume responsibility for managing one or more aspects of COPD. 9 The majority of those interventions are based on the cognitive behavioral therapy [10][11][12][13][14][15] increasing problem solving and gaining confidence in one's own ability to perform a particular behavior, called self-efficacy. 16 Another used model refers to the willingness and motivation of individuals to change behavior. 17,18 Interventions based on this theory focus on exploring the motivation for behavior change and next adjusting the treatment to this.",

            "text": "Although achieving behavior change is the ultimate goal, a most challenging task is influencing it. There are numerous determinants affecting health behavior and lifestyle, which can be explained by a complex interaction at the level of the patient, health care provider (HCP), health care system, and community. 19,20 First, it is essential that patients feel supported in the clinical encounter, increase their motivation and self-efficacy preferably in an equal patient-HCP partnership making shared decisions possible. 21 The patient's perspective is essential, and the role of the HCP shifts from a leading to a more coaching role during consultation. 22 This commitment to equality in which there occurs a rearrangement of tasks and responsibilities is also called \"patient empowerment\". 23 Second, both the patients and the HCPs need competencies to optimally interact during this encounter. Spencer and Spencer 24 distinguish visible and less-visible underlying competencies indicating ways of behaving or thinking, which generalizes across a wide range of situations and endures for long period of time. Among these visible competencies are the degree of knowledge, general and communication skills of both patients and HCPs. Examples of less visible underlying competencies of both patients and HCPs are: beliefs (attitudes), motivation, values, motives, and personality characteristics. These can influence the consultation encounter to a large extent. The degree of self-efficacy can also be seen as one of these invisible competencies. Within chronic disease management, it is seen as one of the most essential competencies to achieve behavioral change. 25,9 A third important mechanism empowering patients is the embedding of self-management in the organizational care process 26 as understood according to the chronic care model. 27,28 Because of the numerous health care professionals involved in COPD treatment in both primary care and hospital care, good cooperation and coordination between the patient and the various levels of health care are essential. Another less accentuated influencing organizational factor is the duration of the consultation time on self-management.",

The action plans are still highly focused on medical regimes and to a lesser extent on adapting lifestyle and setting up personal goals. 45 Similar modest numbers apply to used motivational interviewing techniques during consultation by general practitioners and community nurses. 46 There is still a poor understanding of both the effective facilitators as barriers concerning the implementation of self-management. A better comprehension of these facilitators and barriers can have significant implications for the direction of further development of self-management interventions and the optimization of the implementation of self-management in health care.",

Development of the matrix was based on the most common-coded key concepts extracted from HCPs and patients' interviews in the exploratory phase, combined with the foremost contemporary literature concerning self-management.

Despite the great amount of attention paid to lifestyle change and advice during consultation, less emphasis was seen on effective behavioral change and follow-up of the advice given, which is quite understandable given the fact that patients see their HCP once or twice a year.

[53][54][55] Emphasis should be placed on connecting to the goals and motivation of the patient using shared decision making. 21 From the qualitative data-exploration it can be seen that both patients and HCPs experience difficulties defining personalized goals and expectations. Significant influencing factors are causing this disadvantage. Newman's self-management component, social support, is little observed 8 in the consultations, which relates to the extent social context and participation level in everyday life have been explored. This basic understanding of one's personal life, daily activity level, motivation, and values is essential to make a personalized plan in improving health, which are in tune with the perceived limitations and possibilities in daily living activities. Verhage et al 56 point out the necessity of a detailed patient assessment with the recognition of the diversity of patients in their knowledge and skills, health perception, level of communication, and the motivation to work on their self-management. A customized selfmanagement approach where the patient's social context, individual background, desires and capabilities are taken into account is lacking. 5 Another negatively influencing aspect observed in patient-HCP interaction is the profoundly structured consultation, where explicit attention is given to monitoring and assessment aspects of the COPD. This tendency toward a more rationalized, biomedical medicine, based on protocols and guidelines is a movement which has distinguished itself in the last 15 years. 57 The patient-HCP interaction is subsequently changing where the HCP is more proactive, whereas the patient is unwittingly pushed into a more passive role. This is a very contradictory development. Equality between patient and HCP during consultation must be pursued and is most essential in patient-centered communication. Consequently patients feel more uninhibited, which results in them taking a proactive role, sharing their ideas, worries, and questions, and making shared decisions possible.",

However the high percentage of maximum patient scores made it difficult to measure effects (ceiling effect). While there is no straightforward answer for this observed discrepancy between the perceived patient-centered communication between patient and HCP, one interpretation could be that the HCPs are more critical about themselves concerning their consultation compared with how patients judge this. On one hand, we see satisfied patients with the traditional consultation structure; and on the other hand, we have HCPs indicating having difficulties in formulating patient-orientated goals. We can identify the fact that patients are not yet well accustomed to their new role as a proactive patient, which is also hampered by the overall observed traditional and medically oriented type of consultation structure.
