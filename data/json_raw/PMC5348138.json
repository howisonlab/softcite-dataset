This study hypothesized that the elevated beat-to-beat BPV could evoke the reduction of the vascular elasticity independent of BP levels. We measured the beat-to-beat BP recordings and total arterial compliance (TAC), which was used to assess the vascular elasticity, in 80 young healthy adults during the cold pressor test (CPT). The CPT included 3 phases: baseline phase, cold stimulus phase, recovery phase. Six parameters were used to estimate BPV. In bivariate correlation analysis, TAC showed a significant correlation with systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) in the cold stimulus phase; and 4 indices of SBP variability (SBPV) were associated with TAC (r = 0.271\u223c0.331, P 0.015) in the recovery phase; similarly, 2 indices of DBP variability (DBPV) were also correlated with TAC (r = 0.221\u223c0.285, P 0.048) in the recovery phase. In multivariate regression analysis, DBPV (b = 0.229, P = 0.001) was a determinant of TAC independent of average DBP, sex, and weight. In addition, both beat-to-beat BP and BPV values increased in the cold stimulus phase (P < 0.01); whereas, the TAC decreased in the cold stimulus phase (P < 0.01). In conclusion, these data suggest that the beat-to-beat DBPV shows an independent association with the vascular elasticity in young normal adults during the CPT.

            "text": "According to the report from the World Health Organization, the cardiovascular disease (CVD) remained the number one cause of death globally. [1] Some studies had demonstrated that aging played an important role in the progress of CVD, [2][3][4] and the early vascular aging reflected the progress of aging on vascular tree and arterial function. [5] The early vascular aging could cause the structural and functional modifications in the vasculature, accompanied by the decreased arterial elasticity and elevated arterial stiffness. [6,7] Arterial elasticity could be assessed by total arterial compliance (TAC). TAC was an assessment of the stiffness of the arteries in the entire arterial tree, [8] and it reflected the elasticity of the vascular system. [9,10] Some studies had demonstrated that TAC played a critical role in predicting CVD. [9][10][11][12] Moreover, previous studies had also manifested that TAC was an important determinant of arterial load, left ventricle (LV) afterload, and pulse wave velocities (PWV). [13,14] TAC might be influenced by the blood pressure (BP) parameters, such as BP and BP variability (BPV). Recently, some studies investigated the relation between short-term BPV parameters, which included the 24-hour BPV and beat-to-beat BPV, and vascular properties. [7,[15][16][17][18][19] And they found that the increased 24-hour BPV had adverse influences on the vascular properties, [7,[15][16][17][18] while the relationship between vascular properties and beat-to-beat BPV was non-significant. [19] Beat-to-beat BP measurement was increasingly used both in the research field and clinical research, as it could reflect more information than 24-hour BP and office BP. [20] And beat-to-beat BP recordings were considered as the optimal method to obtain the short-term BPV. [19,20] Moreover, beat-to-beat BP parameters had also been proved to associate with CVD and target organ damage. [19,21] Accurate beat-to-beat BP used to obtain from invasive method [22] ; the non-invasive continuous BP monitoring in the finger arterial was an excellent innovation in continuous BP measurement.",

In the experiment, the subjects lay in the supine position on a single bed quietly throughout the experimental procedure. The procedure of the CPT experiment lasted 13 minutes and included 3 phases (showed in Fig. 1): the baseline phase (5 minutes), the cold stimulus phase (3 minutes), and the recovery phase (5 minutes). In the cold stimulus phase, the subject immersed his/her left hand to the wrist into a mixture of ice and water (4\u00b0C) for 3 minutes. During the entire experimental procedure, cardiovascular signals were collected by Finometer MIDI (Model II, Finapres Medical Systems B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands); and the cardiovascular signals mainly included SBP, DBP, stoke volume, and electrocardiograph (ECG). Then these cardiovascular signals were stored in a personal computer by the BeatScope Easy software (Finapres Medical Systems B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The BP was measured by the volume-clamp method in the Finometer MIDI [25] ; in the volume-clamp method, a cuff wrapped around the finger to keep the arterial diameter constant, and the changes in the arterial diameter were detected by photo-plethysmography [25] ; physiocal algorithm was used to maintain the correct arterial diameter. [26] The stroke volume was measured by Modelflow method [25] ; the Modelflow method was utilized to calculate an aortic flow waveform from the finger pressure by simulating a non-linear three-element model of aortic input impedance. [25] 2.3. TAC assessment There was no \"gold standard\" to assess the TAC. Chemla et al [13] proposed the ratio of stroke volume to pulse pressure (SV/PP) to measure TAC. The pulse pressure represented the difference between SBP and DBP readings. The SV/PP had been proven reliable to assess the TAC. [11] Therefore, we used SV/PP to estimate TAC in this study.",

[27] However, the assessment by SD might be unreliable in multivariate module, [28,29] because SD only reflected the global fluctuation of BP measurements around the mean value and did not take the time sequence of measurements into account. CV was derived from SD and mean BP, and it might be correlated with mean BP. To overcome these disadvantages of the commonly used SD and CV, average real variability (ARV), variation independent of mean (VIM), residual standard deviation (RSD), and successive variation (SV) were established to estimate the prognostic significance of BPV. [28][29][30][31] ARV took the time sequence of individual BP measurements into account, and it could also estimate the trend of BPV without making any assumptions regarding the shape of the relationship between BP values and time. [28] VIM was a transformation of SD that was uncorrelated with mean levels. [29] When VIM was used as an index of BPV, it could eliminate the effects of mean BP levels. RSD was defined as the square root of the residual mean square after fitting a linear regression to BP against time [30] ; and it was more suitable than SD to estimated BPV when the BP fluctuation had an underlying trend over time, especially the underlying trend was approximately linear. SV was defined as the square root of the average squared difference between successive BP measurements; and it also addressed the time sequence of measurements. [31] In this study, SD, CV, VIM, ARV, SV, and RSD were used to assess BPV. Because the BPV included SBPV and DBPV, we used these indices to quantify SBPV and DBPV, respectively. These parameters were calculated using the following formulas: ",

The beat-to-beat BPV mainly reflects the effects of the central sympathetic drive, arterial or cardiopulmonary reflex, humoral, rheological, behavioral, and emotional factors. [20] When the vascular elasticity reduces, it can be associated with the change of the BPV. Moreover, previous studies have explored the relationship between vascular properties and short-term BPV both in healthy population [7] and in patient population. [15][16][17][18][19] In these studies, PWV was used to assess the arterial stiffness, and intima-media thickness (IMT) was a surrogate marker for atherosclerosis. Kotsis et al [7] studied 115 young healthy volunteers; and they manifested that increased 24-hour SBPV associated with arterial stiffness in young healthy population. Schillaci et al [15] explored the relationship between 24-hour BPV and aortic stiffness in hypertensive population, and found that the association between ARV and PWV was closer than other indices; and they thought that ARV focused on the very shortterm BPV between successive readings. Stabouli et al [16] studied 138 children and adolescents patients; and they attested that weighted 24-hour and daytime SBPV associated with arterial stiffness in children and adolescents. Tatasciore et al [17] studied the correlation between 24-hour BPV and IMT in 180 untreated hypertensive subjects; and they found that awake SBPV was a better correlate of IMT than 24 hour SBPV. Mancia et al [18] explored 1663 hypertensive patients; they also manifested that 24-h SBPV was related to IMT. Furthermore, Wei et al [19] investigated the relationship between arterial stiffness and BPV over different periods in 256 untreated patients; they used ARV, VIM, and maximum-minimum difference (MMD) to assess the BPV; and they found that the PWV increased with beat-to-beat SBP, but did not increase with beat-to-beat SBPV; moreover, they also found that the PWV increased with 24-hour SBP and VIM of 24-hour SBP. In stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis, our results showed that VIM of DBP was an independent determinant of the vascular elasticity, but the correlation of TAC with SBPV was not significant. The different methods to estimate the BPV and vascular properties might cause the difference.",

The increased beat-to-beat BP levels and BPV values in the cold stimulus phase were due to the increased sympathetic nervous  system (SNS) activity. The analysis of HRV is a reliable method to assess the autonomic nervous system. [32] The LF component (0.04-0.15 Hz) is regarded as a marker of SNS, and the HF component (0.15-0.4 Hz) mainly reflects the parasympathetic nerve system (PNS) activity [33] ; the LF/HF is comprehensive measure of autonomic balance. [32] Our results showed that the LF and LF/HF increased, while the HF decreased in the cold stimulus phase. It suggested that the cold stimulus increased the SNS activity and reduced the PNS activity. The SNS activity caused the constriction of resistance vessels and resulted in the increase of the BP level and BPV value. [24] Weise et al [34] also investigated the influence of the CPT on short-term fluctuations of finger arterial BP; they tested 10 healthy subjects' BP, and manifested that the cold stimulus induced significant increases in SBP and DBP; whereas, the changes of SBPV and DBPV, assessed by SD, were not significant. The small size of the subjects and the BPV assessed only by SD might contribute to the changes of BPV non-significant in their study. Furthermore, the reduction of the TAC during the CPT in young normal adults may result from the increased SNS activity and the elevated BP. Some evidences show that the TAC decreases with aging, BP, CVD, and SNS activity. [12,35] The changes of HRV in frequency domain during the CPT have confirmed that the cold stimulus evoked the increase in SNS activity. Increased SNS activity led to the reduction of the TAC. Boutouyrie et al [35] used a noninvasive method to investigate the impact of SNS activity on arterial compliance in normal subject; and they also demonstrated that SNS activity could induce a reduction of TAC. Furthermore, our results exhibited that the TAC had significant correlation with LF and HF component during the baseline and recovery phase of CPT, while the correlation of TAC with LF and HF component was not significant in cold stimulus phase. The reduction of TAC might lead to the correlation of TAC with LF and HF component became non-significant in cold stimulus phase.",

Given the nature of cross-sectional design, we could not elucidate whether the elevated BPV induced the reduction of the TAC or versa. Larger longitudinal studies are needed to estimate the prognostic implications of beat-to-beat BPV on TAC in young normal adults. On the other hand, the sample size of the present study was relatively small. The relatively small sample size may have some influences on the results.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the beat-to-beat BPV associates with the TAC in the recovery phase of the CPT. As TAC reflects the elasticity of the vascular system, it implies that the increased beat-to-beat BPV has an impact on vascular elasticity, and elevates the progress of the early vascular aging in normal young adults. In addition, we have also confirmed that the cold stimulus increased SNS activity and evoked the increase in BP levels and variability, but reduced the TAC. Furthermore, more clinical experiments are needed to confirm the correlations between beatto-beat BPV and vascular elasticity not only in healthy population but also in hypertensive population.",
