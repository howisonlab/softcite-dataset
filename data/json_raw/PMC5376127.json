When MoS 2 as a representative 2D material is deposited on transition metals (such as Cu) in a controlled manner, the sulfidation reactions also occur with the metal. This process results in remarkably unique structures, that is, bulk layered heterojunctions (BLHJs) of Cu-Mo-S that contain MoS 2 flakes inside, which are uniformly dispersed in the Cu 2 S matrix. The resulting structures were expected to induce asymmetric charge transfer via layered frameworks and tested as electrocatalysts for HERs. Upon suitable thermal treatments, the BLHJ surfaces exhibited the efficient HER performance of approximately 10 mA/cm 2 at a potential of \u22120.1 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. The Tafel slope was approximately 30 to 40 mV per decade. The present strategy was further generalized by demonstrating the formation of BLHJs on other transition metals, such as Ni. The resulting BLHJs of Ni-Mo-S also showed the remarkable HER performance and the stable operation over 10 days without using Pt counter electrodes by eliminating any possible issues on the Pt contamination.",

The cost-effective and efficient splitting of water is a critical issue in technologies and economies with energy delivery systems that use hydrogen, enabling zero emission of greenhouse gases (1). A key challenge in the electrocatalyst design is the performance-cost trade-off of using the platinum-group metals as a cathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (2)(3)(4)(5). Two different approaches have constituted the major branches of science in this domain of research. One approach is to use less or optimized amounts of precious elements, such as nanoparticulate Pt on carbon supports (6). The other approach is to find new alloy compositions based on Pt. In exploring new alloy composition, computational simulations are beneficial in the development of previously unknown single-phase systems (7,8). Although more complex surface structures involving platinum have exhibited experimental improvements (9)(10)(11), efficient electrocatalysts consisting of nonprecious elements have recently been more actively studied (12)(13)(14)(15). Transition metal chalcogenide-based systems, such as MoS 2 , provide many possibilities for HER because they have unique anisotropic surface/transport properties and provide surfaces with the desired binding energy/site for H + (16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21). However, a material equivalent to platinum in terms of the onset potential, the Tafel slope, and the long-term stability has not yet been developed.",

            "text": "The activation processes on the catalyst surfaces were believed to be the essential mechanisms for HER, and thus, surface energies matter in the development of HER catalysts with high efficacy. This would be true as for the case of monometallic Pt (22), and seeking platinum-like surfaces seems rational among cost-effective elements. Recent research activities have been headed in this direction accordingly. However, when nonmetallic catalysts are involved, the charge transfer resistance rather than surface reactions themselves would play a significant role and should be considered. A recent study by Voiry et al. (23) experimentally exhibited that the catalytically inert basal plane of 2H MoS 2 can be active by controlling the charge transfer resistance of the system. Beyond identifying platinum-like surfaces, we propose here a novel electrocatalytic concept consisting of two-dimensional (2D) materials in bulk; we refer to this concept as the inorganic bulk layered heterojunction (BLHJ). Our approach is based on a simple fabrication technique for the direct growth of MoS 2 on self-supported metallic substrates via sequential gas-phase reactions, which result in the spontaneous formation of dense BLHJ structures via spontaneous sulfidation reactions. These structures contain MoS 2 flakes, which are dispersed in the Cu 2 S matrix (resembling \"straw in mud plaster\"). The present system not only features distinctive inorganic, dense BLHJ structures, which are difficult to prepare experimentally using any other methods, but also has layered 2D materials as the key anisotropic components that trigger unusual charge transfer processes.",

Incorporating the target layered materials into the bulk chalcogenide host with secure contact interfaces between suitable nanoscale junctions in a controlled manner is difficult (Fig. 1B). We used the sequential gas-phase surface reaction technique for which the reactants, such as Mo or S, are independently delivered into the substrates so that only the surface-limited reactions occur. Because the substrate metal used for the self-supporting electrode is simultaneously sulfidizable, this growth mode is expected to incorporate a layered system into the bulk chalcogenide host. In the design of the BLHJ, another important consideration is to select two chalcogenide systems that are thermodynamically immiscible at given temperatures. For example, copper as the substrate material and Mo for sulfidation will lead to the desired immiscible phase separation to form an inorganic BLHJ with MoS 2 at relatively lower temperatures (<300\u00b0C) (24). In addition to the formation of thermodynamically immiscible systems, it is Earth-abundant and cheap. Moreover, the quality of Cu as the electrochemical electrode has been verified in the field of battery, and thus, the possible side effects could be ruled out.",

            "text": "First, we established the sequential gas-phase surface reaction technique for the precursors on SiO 2 /Si substrates in a flow-type reactor (about 150 mm in diameter), analogous to the atomic layer deposition (ALD) procedure. To obtain a preliminary result, for example, we used MoCl 5 and H 2 S as the reactants and separated their alternating exposures by N 2 purging ( fig. S1). The nucleation and growth along the basal planes were strongly affected by the gas flow from the inlet of the chamber ( fig. S2). Remarkably, the uniformity of thickness was not maintained across the substrates under the given process conditions ( fig. S2). This result has not been reported previously in the context of ALD studies (25,26), but it is understandable on the basis of the strong structural anisotropy of the resulting materials. The resulting MoS 2 layers have distinctive features that are dependent on the distance from the chamber inlet not only in thickness but also in terms of the morphologies ( fig. S2D). Larger uniform growth zones were optimized by increasing the pulse time  On the basis of the chemical reaction of MoCl 5 and H 2 S in the gas phase, we suspect that chloride ions are inevitably left in the films during the reaction; thus, the resulting MoS 2 nanoflakes incorporate Cl as an impurity. Evidence for the presence of Cl was confirmed by the chemical analysis techniques of energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) ( fig. S4, A to E), although the layered nature was preserved (figs. S4F and S7). Approximately 5 to 10 atomic % of chloride ions were detected. Mott-Schottky measurements revealed the significant amount of negatively charged species, such as Cl ions, that had a density of~10 23 /cm 3  (fig. S8). This order of magnitude is consistent with the chemical analysis results. The doping density was measured using the Hall measurement technique with van der Pauw geometry and indicates that the Cl dopants are not fully thermally activated (with an electron density of~10 19 /cm 3 ; fig. S9). This result is simply a consequence of the low growth temperature (that is, 250\u00b0C). In a recent study by Yang et al. (27), this Cl doping was reported to decrease the contact resistance through a significant reduction of the Schottky barrier width. Therefore, the fact that our methodology is intrinsically capable of Cl doping should be beneficial in the design of the present BLHJ structures with efficient charge transport characteristics, as will be discussed later.",

            "text": "The aforementioned processes were used to directly deposit MoS 2 onto copper foil (~20 mm in thickness). The corresponding surface reactions were visible across a large area (approximately 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm; Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1D, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image is the representative morphology of the resulting materials on Cu (see fig. S11 for more details). Well-dispersed nanoparticles (bright contrast) embedded in the matrix were observed. A representative scanning transmission electron micrograph shows that the layered structures were densely incorporated into the matrix (that is, CuS x ) during the reactions (Fig. 1E). The embodiment of MoS 2 and the sulfidation of Cu simultaneously occurred during the fabrication of MoS 2 , resulting in the formation of Cu x S and MoS 2 (hereafter termed as CMS), which are immiscible according to their phase diagram at the given temperature (24). The sulfidation of Cu can be understood in the context of the adsorbate-induced surface band bending (28), charge transfer by the H 2 S molecules, and the subsequent diffusion processes of sulfur inside. We observed a much higher growth rate of CuS x /CMS than that of  fig. S15). Notably, according to the bulk phase diagram of the Cu-Mo-S system, alloying Cu x Mo 6 S 8 is expected at higher temperatures, that is, temperatures greater than~700\u00b0C (24). Therefore, the Chevrel phase formation was understood to be the local alloying effect at the interfaces even upon annealing at 500\u00b0C (Fig. 1G). Although their presence was evident in the TEM investigation, the clear detection of the smaller portions of both MoS 2 and Cu x Mo 6 S 8 was limited to the x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (fig. S16) (29). Upon being subjected to further heat treatment processes, the Chevrel phase was unambiguously observed to be Cu 2.76 Mo 6 S 8 in the XRD patterns ( fig. S16). Note that the overall distribution of Mo was uniform across the CMS layers (figs. S17 to S19). These observations further imply that the CMS surfaces were also partly terminated by both the MoS 2 nanoflakes and the Chevrel clusters, elucidating the CMS/TiO 2 interface in detail ( fig. S20).",

            "text": "We constructed a conventional three-electrode measurement setup in homemade Teflon cells ( fig. S21) using a CMS/Cu cathode, a Pt anode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a sulfuric acid electrolyte. The cathode was first protected with amorphous TiO 2 , which was grown by ALD to achieve initial protection (fig. S22, A and B) (30). Notably, this TiO 2 coating can initially function as an efficient electronic transport layer for HER (31) and serve the initial activation processes (for example, electrical annealing) of the CMS layers, as will be discussed later. HER activity was investigated at different processing steps and compared with control samples (Fig. 2, A to C). Although Cu and Cu 2 S themselves exhibit little HER activity under the given measurement conditions, the as-grown CMS that was exhibited substantially enhanced the HER activity. The annealed CMS shows further improvement in the HER. Notably, although the surfaces of Cu 2 S showed negligible HER activities, the presence of the MoS 2 inside certainly contributed to the enhancement of the charge transfer characteristics. After one more junction of TiO 2 was added not only as a protective layer but also as an efficient charge transport layer, remarkably, our CMS material exhibited a nearly zero onset potential and a Tafel slope of~39 mV/decade (dec) (Fig. 2C). These values are comparable with those of our sputtered Pt films and the literature values of Pt (22,32). To the best of our knowledge, the present study shows the best performance record for HER activities among any other reported materials' systems using nonprecious elements in terms of both the onset potential and the Tafel slope. Note that the resulting high current density did not stem from the large specific surface area and represents the material's property itself. Normalizing the porosity in the HER performance simplifies comparisons among intrinsic properties (32). The roughness factor of our system was estimated to be~1.3 by electrochemically active surface area with double-layer capacitance measurements ( fig. S23). Surface roughness of our planar structure is 5 to 8 nm in root mean square roughness (R RMS ) measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) ( fig. S22C). Moreover, the TiO 2 /CMS/Cu samples were operated stably as HER cathodes for well over a 10-day run at \u22120.1 V ( Fig. 2E). Possible issues on the contamination of Pt were ruled out by carefully analyzing XPS results before and after stability tests (figs. S24 to S26). These superior performances that are comparable with that of Pt were reproducibly observed in samples from four different batches ( fig. S27). Nonetheless, a lingering suspicion on the subtle amounts of Pt contamination would be the electrochemical redeposition of Pt during HER under a harsh condition (33) (that is, cycling at larger voltages than \u22120.1 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) used for stability tests, for example, similar to fig.  S25). Therefore, we present the HER results by both the conventional three-electrode measurements using Pt counter electrodes as the standard methodology (that is, BLHJ-Ag/AgCl-Pt) and the three-electrode measurements with BLHJ as monolithic electrodes [that is, BLHJ-SCE (saturated calomel electrode)-BLHJ]. The HER results of the CMS layers with a non-Pt counter electrode showed similar performance ( fig. S28). How to intrinsically avoid the usage of Pt electrodes will also be demonstrated below with the development of Ni-Mo-S (NMS) systems.",

            "text": "A question naturally arises as to what the present mechanisms are. Note that this experimental value of the Tafel slope (around 30 mV/dec) has been observed on Pt(111), assuming extreme coverage of hydrogen and the Tafel reaction (34)(35)(36). Our observation might indicate that the ratedetermining steps are not simply based on the surface species adsorbed (that is, binding energy matters), but the electron transfer kinetics through the bulk should be seriously considered. One clue is that the impedance analysis exhibited a systematic reduction in the resistance of the whole system as a result of thermal treatment and the addition of distinctive junction interfaces (Fig. 2D). We ascribe the observed high performance for HER to not only the macroscopic mechanism based on band diagrams but also the microscopic structures of our unique system. To measure the work functions of our CMS layers and other control samples, we first complementarily used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) ( fig. S29). The order of the work function values (F s ) was MoS 2 > Cu 2 S > CMS. This implies the reduction of energy barriers when electrons transfer from the Cu electrode and is consistent with the impedance analysis. The presence of Cl in the MoS 2 and its diffusion in the resulting BLHJ structures should be addressed. If the MoS 2 flakes are to be formed inside the BLHJs in a similar way, then the Cl-doped MoS 2 nanoflakes should contribute to improved transport properties (figs. S5 and S6). The estimated small energy gap from an Arrhenius plot also supports easy processes for the thermal activation of electrons ( fig. S10). Therefore, the presence of Cl and the resulting electrical doping effect will play a key role in the charge transfer via the inner frameworks consisting of the MoS 2 flakes. Moreover, the XPS results on the annealed CMS would testify a possibility of Cl diffusion into Cu 2 S if larger amounts of Cl were detected out of the surfaces of CMS than those of MoS 2 . We observed the higher portions of Cl when compared with those expected in the MoS 2 nanoflakes. From this observation, we could therefore conclude the presence of Cl even in the Cu 2 S matrix, and similar electrical effects, such as a reduction of the Schottky barrier width by doping, are expected. At the interface between TiO 2 and electrolytes, both scenarios are possible. One is the transfer via the surface Cu 2 S because the conduction level of TiO 2 is well below that of Cu 2 S. The other is the transport through the conductive TiO 2 . The optical absorption measurements were carried out to estimate the bandgap of our TiO 2 layers ( fig. S30). Although whether the ALD-grown, amorphous TiO 2 has direct or indirect transitions is not clear, we believe that the charge transfer mechanism occurs below the conduction band of TiO 2 through the defect sites ( fig. S31). The detailed transport mechanisms of the ALD-grown, amorphous TiO 2 are under debate (37)(38)(39). Nonetheless, the coating of TiO 2 overlayers resulted in the formation of ideal interfaces with our CMS layers in terms of electron transfer and initial activation. The former is further understood as a framework of the formation of Cu 2 S/TiO 2 ohmic junctions. Notably, all the other control junctions, such as MoS 2 /TiO 2 , exhibited no improvement in charge transfer during HER ( fig. S32). A very recent report demonstrated that TiO 2 layers grown via the same ALD chemistry exhibited significant improvement in electron collection efficacy, with a shift (greater than 0.2 V) of the open-circuit voltage in InP heterojunction solar cells (40). The Cu 2 S/TiO 2 control junctions solely exhibited clear improvement for HER ( fig. S32). Note that the amorphous titania layers were not kept on the CMS layers upon long-term operation by detecting no XPS signal of titania ( fig. S26). Nevertheless, this layer functioned for initial activation of the underlying CMS layers for long-term stability. We believe that the presence of TiO 2 surface layer contributes to the initial charge extraction processes from the CMS BLHJs as follows. We suspect that the long-term operation at the high current density (about tens of microampere per square centimeter) resulted in the electrical annealing of the CMS layers (41), and the performance would become stable possibly by improving the electrical connectivity of the frameworks of MoS 2 . This argument could be supported by comparing the XPS results after~100-hour testing ( fig. S26) and the chronogalvanometry results for~10 days (Fig. 2). Moreover, these currents could be further localized for their pass only through the MoS 2 frameworks [see the results of conductive AFM (C-AFM) below].",

The local probe measurements on the resulting CMS layer confirmed that the MoS 2 nanoflakes were likely manifested in the transport mechanisms. We carried out C-AFM and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements on the surfaces of the CMS. The potential maps that were thus monitored indicated the successful formation of nanoscale spatial junctions on the surfaces, indicative of the direct modification of the surface energy by embedding 2D materials inside ( fig. S33). The local conduction results also imply the presence of selective pathways in the conduction throughout the CMS layers, probably via the MoS 2 nanoflakes (Fig. 3, A to C). Notably, these measurements are sensitive to the ideality factor of the junctions between the tip and the sample (42). Our systematic measurements also demonstrate the formation of conductive junction interfaces even at very small loading forces ( fig. S34). In addition to the presence of an anisotropic trigger for charge transport, the inhomogeneity in the energy landscape might help evolve H 2 because of the asymmetric charge injection for HER. The ingeniously arranged local nucleation in a nanometer/micrometer spatial regions would be beneficial for HERs (43). All these findings result in synergetic contributions in determining the charge transfer kinetics for HER.",

            "text": "Therefore, we propose operation principles that might be accountable for the efficient HER performance observed in this study. The present mechanisms have been proposed first by recognizing the fact that the surfaces were mostly terminated by electrocatalytically nonactive materials. Therefore, the classical Volmer-Heyrovsky-Tafel mechanism for HER activity at metal interfaces cannot explain the high HER activity observed here. Although the Tafel reaction having the ideal surface coverage resulted in the theoretical kinetic description to be an ideal Tafel slope of~30 mV/dec, the estimated Tafel slope of~39 mV/dec from our BLHJs could not directly assign the rate-determining step (36). As a result, we suggested that the present BLHJ systems have localized transport paths with reduced charge transfer resistance, which serve as the true active site for HER on the basis of the abovementioned observations. By spontaneous sulfidation reactions, followed by heat treatment, the dense BLHJ structures were prepared, and the resulting microstructure exhibited the successful formation of internal networks consisting of the MoS 2 and the Chevrel phases. The presence of MoS 2 nanoflakes with strong anisotropy inside the bulk can boost the internal transport of charge carriers across the CMS layers inside during the surface reactions. That is, the metal substrate serves as a self-supported cathode, injecting electrons into the CMS layer. In general, the drift and diffusion processes are responsible for the major transport mechanisms during HER. Because the MoS 2 is rather confined in the BLHJ, the strong anisotropy should lead to an enhancement in the spatial charge transport via different mechanisms, thereby enabling the design of unique electrocatalysts. Moreover, the mobility of MoS 2 is strongly dependent on the dielectric screening of its surroundings (44). The resulting MoS 2 nanoflakes were embedded in the Cu 2 S matrix; thus, this situation should be advantageous to the anisotropic charge transport. As previously discussed, the Cl doping of MoS 2 would modify the structures, lower the energy barriers, and shorten the barrier widths with its contact materials, if any (45). Moreover, the Chevrel Cu x Mo 6 S 8 clusters formed between the MoS 2 and Cu 2 S should facilitate the transfer of charge carriers, operating as gradient junctions. The nanoscale dimensions of the resulting MoS 2 flakes in the bulk CMS should lead to the environmental pinning at the Fermi levels inside the bulk and the further lowering of the barrier heights (45). Despite the complex geometries in defining the contact interfaces, the energy band diagrams suggest ideal junction interfaces with negligible barrier heights ( fig.  S31) (46). As shown in Fig. 3D, the embedded MoS 2 flakes can function as sharp tips at the near surfaces and are additionally responsible for energy barrier lowering by the localized fields as proposed mechanisms. The present strategy reported here differs from conventional electrocatalytic concepts that seek the optimum surface binding energy to H + , not only experimentally but also theoretically (table S1). To date, no such electrocatalysts exist, satisfying both the ideal catalyst surface (that is, the onset potential and the Tafel slope) and the long-term stability ( fig. S35).",

We applied the present strategy to the porous Ni form as another transition metal where the similar incorporation is expected as well as to the BLHJs of NMS. The difference between Cu and Ni is the cohesive energy (47), and the degree of sulfidation should be different when MoS 2 was grown under identical conditions. Because Ni has greater bonding strength than Cu, the formation of NiS x was suppressed and the relative amounts of MoS 2 were found to be larger by its spontaneous incorporation as in the CMS case ( fig. S36). The BLHJs of NMS also showed the remarkable HER performance without postthermal treatments (Fig. 4). The resulting NMS plates were tested without using Pt counter electrodes to eliminate any possible issues on the trace amount of Pt contamination. Three-electrode measurements [that is, NMS as a working electrode, NMS as a counter electrode, and SCE as a reference] were carried out and exhibited similar performance and superior stability (Fig. 4F). These results explicitly testify that the outstanding HER performance undoubtedly comes from our BLHJ structures. Furthermore, any issues on the contamination of Pt can be completely ruled out by substituting the counter Pt electrode as our NMS, indicative of the technical feasibility of direct utility of the present systems for HERs. The simultaneous incorporation of 2D chalcogenides during sulfidation of desired metals should also open a new path for research in nanocomposites that are currently difficult or not possible to synthesize.",

The degree of sulfidation of Cu was also affected by the flow during the reaction, as in the case of MoS 2 , whereas the amounts of MoS 2 (determined by detecting Mo) inside the CMS layers remained nearly constant (fig. S12C). This independence offers valuable benefits to the rapid optimization of the MoS 2 concentration within the bulk layers when the present system is applied to the HER. Within the thickness gradient investigated, the HER activities showed few differences (fig. S13). A comparison of the resulting thicknesses of the deposited hybrid composites confirmed that we could generate BLHJs of Cu-Mo-S with controlled amounts of MoS 2 . The subsequent thermal annealing at 500\u00b0C (for~1 hour under N 2 flow; see Materials and Methods for more details) allowed further control over the heterojunction structures of CMS by local alloying at the interfaces between Cu x S and MoS 2 (fig.
