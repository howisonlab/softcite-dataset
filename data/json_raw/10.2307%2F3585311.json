            "text": "While stock returns in the United States this past century have exceeded Treasury returns by an average of about 6% annually, in the last few years they have done so by more than 12% annually. Commentators have suggested a variety of explanations for the dramatic stock-market run-up that accompanied these high returns. The baby boom is entering peak savings years, productivity has escalated worldwide due to technological improvements and political change, and stock-market participation rates are on the rise. The growth of mutual funds has lowered transaction costs and made diversification feasible. Public awareness of the benefits of stockmarket investing is high. On the other hand, irrational exuberance could be fueling the price rise, with inexperienced investors expecting doubledigit returns to continue indefinitely or at least long enough to reap a substantial gain.",

            "text": "Whether the price rise is due primarily to fundamentals or whether it is the result of a bubble is important to policymakers concerned with avoiding the real disruption a sharp stock-market decline could precipitate. It is also important to the academic debate over the determinants of stock valuations. Because this paper is about the relations between stock prices and fundamentals, we emphasize three broad categories of explanations for the recent price rise: changes in corporate earnings growth, changes in consumer preferences, and changes in stock-market participation patterns. The goal in qualifying the importance of fundamental effects is to better understand whether a combination of fundamentals and statistical fluctuation can plausibly explain the observed magnitudes, or whether a bubble is the likely cause of the price rise.",

            "text": "Although the paper touches on a variety of issues, its main contribution is to look more closely at how participation patterns have changed, and at how they are expected to affect required returns in a stochastic equilibrium model. We interpret participation broadly to include both the fraction of the population that holds any stocks, and the degree of diversification of a typical stockholder. To review the evidence, we use data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to document changes in stockholding patterns and reported attitudes toward risk from 1989 to 1995. Consistent with previous studies (e.g., Poterba, 1993;Vissing-Jorgensen, 1997), we see an increasing rate of stock-market participation over time. Participation rates among the wealthy, who own the majority of stock, however, have increased only slightly. Foreign participation changes may also influence required returns. Using data from the U.S. Treasury, we find that net purchases of stocks by foreigners have been relatively high in recent years, but small in comparison with total trading volume. Finally, flow-of-funds data show that diversification has increased markedly, with large outflows of individual stocks from household portfolios moving into mutual funds and other institutional accounts.",

This extends the analyses of Basak and Cuoco (1998), Saito (1995), and Vissing-Jorgensen (1997), all of whom consider the effect of participation when traded securities span income realizations. We use this framework to experiment with changes in stock-market participation rates, changes in background risk, changes in preferences, and changes in the expected dividend process reflecting changes in diversification. We find that for realistic changes in raw participation rates, expected stock returns change very little. Within the range of riskaversion parameters normally considered, preference changes also have little effect on expected return differentials. Changing the rate of time preference has a significant effect on the level of all returns, but not on the differential between stock and bond returns. One factor that appears to have a significant effect on required returns is the degree of assumed diversification. This suggests that one fundamental reason for the stock price run-up may be the rapid growth of mutual funds and the accompanying large increase in diversification.",

The influence of participation rates, extent of diversification, background income risk, and preferences on stock prices is examined in Section 4 in an overlappinggenerations model. By considering a variety of scenarios reflecting simultaneous changes in several of these factors, we show that changes in fundamentals can account for perhaps half of the observed increase in price-dividend ratios in the model.

Over the period 1871 to 1998, the average annual (log) real return on a broadbased index of U.S. stocks was 7.3%, compared to an average (log) real return on bonds of about 3%.1 The return on stocks over the last few years has exceeded this historical average. For example, since 1991, the average real return on stocks was 17% per year.

To illustrate this, Figure 1 plots the ratios of prices to dividends and prices to earnings for aggregate U.S. stocks. (For the years since 1926 this is based on the S&P 500 index.) Notice that the price-dividend ratio for this index has increased to an unprecedented level since about 1995. The increase in this ratio is significant because in a discountedcash-flow model of stock valuation, it indicates a reduction in the expected rate of return or an increase in the dividend growth rate (see Section 3). Because dividends are discretionary and only one of the ways in which corporations distribute cash to shareholders, it may be more informative to look at price-earnings ratios. Figure 1 also shows the ratio of prices to earnings. This ratio is also at a relatively high level, but the change has not been as dramatic as for dividends.",

For example, Table 1 reports the results of regressing annual (log) stock returns on a constant and the log of the price-dividend ratio lagged one year for the period 1887 to 1998. Notice that the coefficient on the dividend-price ratio is negative. This is consistent with a large body of evidence (e.g., Campbell and Shiller, 1988;Hodrick, 1992;Lamont, 1998). At the current high level of the  1860  1880  1900  1920  1940  1960  1980  2000 price-dividend ratio, this regression predicts a substantial decline in the stock market over the next year. In fact, since 1995 this regression has consistently predicted a decline in the stock market. On the other hand, due to the substantial variability in stock returns, it is possible that the recent returns are within the bounds of normal statis- aCorrected for conditional heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation using the procedure of Newey and West (1987) and two years of lags.",

Dividends, earnings, and growth are connected by two equations: DIV = (1p)E and g = p(ROE), where DIV is dividends, E is earnings, p is the proportion of earnings reinvested, and ROE is the marginal physical product of capital. If the marginal physical product of capital is constant, and if the fraction of reinvested earnings is constant, then, all else equal, dividend growth is constant.

Other considerations suggest that r may be lower than in the past. One possibility is that aggregate preferences have changed. Either a decrease in risk aversion or an increase in patience could contribute to the run-up in stock prices. Risk aversion could vary across generations due to their varying experiences and circumstances. For example, baby boomers do not share their parents' first-hand experience with the Great Depression. Some have argued that the economy is more stable, reducing the exposure to background risk, and possibly reducing the risk to dividends. Davis and Willen (1998) show, for example, that the income risk for households with various educational attainments has changed over time. Reduced transaction costs in financial markets make diversification easier, which, as discussed below, can reduce effective aversion to the risk of holding stocks as people hold more diversified portfolios.",

The implied population standard deviation across responses is reported in parentheses. Since the population represented by the survey totals approximately 90 million households, the standard errors of the estimates of the means are quite small. Consistent with the idea that risk tolerance has increased, the average reported aversion to risk has decreased slightly for each age category over time. Older households own significantly more stock than younger households, and reported risk aversion increases with age in each survey year. When a similar tabulation (not reported here) is done conditional on households that own at least $500 in stocks, the same patterns emerge with respect to age and time. The average reported level of risk tolerance, however, is higher when we condition on stockholders. For instance, in 1995 the average risk attitude for stockholders over age 65 was 3.17, as compared to 3.58 for all households over 65. This suggests that those who already own stocks are more risk-tolerant as a group than nonparticipants. Hence, the entry of new stockholders may slightly decrease the average level of risk tolerance. One would expect this to mitigate the effect of wider participation in reducing the equity premium. There are objective reasons why the underlying subjective rate of time preference also may be changing. Increases in life expectancy beyond retirement would likely increase the incentive to save and thereby reduce required returns. Mortality, for example, has declined at an average annual rate of 3.3% over the period 1900 to 1988 (Social Security Administration). Past improvements in health and life expectancy might understate expected improvements in these factors that are premised on continued medical progress.4 As with the other explanations considered for the stock price run-up, however, it is hard to point to events that would trigger a large change in aggregate preferences over the course of only a few years.",

This approach has the advantage that it allows one to avoid taking a definitive stand on the magnitude of technology or preference parameter changes. In the tabulations presented here, we focus on earnings-adjusted price-dividend ratios rather than actual price-dividend ratios because earnings are likely to be a more stable proxy for long-run payments to shareholders. Consistent with the average ratio of dividends to earnings over the period 1947 to 1997, we assume an average reinvestment rate of 50%. Hence, the adjusted price-dividend ratio is defined as twice the price-earnings ratio.5",

Column 3 reports the growth rate necessary to match the adjusted price-dividend ratio of 48 in January 1998 (the ratio in January 1999 is even higher at 58). For instance, to realize a real stock return of 7% (consistent with a 6% equity premium and a 1% real risk-free rate) and to match the average historical adjusted price-dividend ratio of 28 requires growth of 3.4%. To match the 1998 adjusted price-dividend ratio of 48, assuming a real risk-free rate of 3% and an equity premium of 6%, requires perpetual growth of 6.9%. This is a large number by historical standards, suggesting that, at least in this simple model, a plausible increase in the expected long-run growth rate is unlikely to be the sole explanation for the increase in stock prices.",

In this case achieving a 9% average rate of return requires a growth rate of 18.9% for ten years! Although these calculations are admittedly primitive, more detailed analyses along similar lines produce qualitatively similar conclusions. For instance, Lee and Swaminathan (1999) estimate the value of individual stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, projecting cash flows using accounting data and analysts' forecasts, and discounting using the CAPM.

There is also evidence that people are entering the market at a younger age. Poterba and Samwick (1997) show that baby boomers are participating more heavily in the market than previous generations at a similar age. Baby boomers are entering peak savings years and directing some of their savings into stocks. More generally, the aging of the population should result in a greater demand for stocks, since older people hold proportionally more of their wealth in the market than do younger people (see, e.g., Heaton and Lucas, 1998).

            "text": "only 1% of investors' wealth was in mutual funds at around that time. In contrast, Poterba (1998) reports a sharp increase in the proportion of stock held in mutual funds over time and a reduction in directly held stocks. For instance, while the total number of individuals holding stock increased from 61.4 million to 69.3 million from 1992 to 1995, the number of individuals holding stock directly fell from 29.2 million to 27.4 million over the same period. In the calibrations presented below, we will look at whether this diversification effect is significant by comparing stock prices with different underlying assumptions about dividend volatility, where high assumed dividend volatility proxies for less diversification. Although these statistics point to an increase in participation and a reduction in risk exposure, it is questionable how significant these effects are quantitatively. The change from 52 million to 69 million participants is a 33% increase, but when the numbers are wealth-weighted, the increase is much smaller. Now as in the past, the vast majority of stocks are held by wealthy individuals. For instance, Poterba (1998) finds that in the 1995 SCF, 82% of stock was held by households with a stock portfolio exceeding $100,000, and 54% of stock was held by households with annual income over $100,000. This suggests that stockholdings remain extremely concentrated. Figures 2 and 3 present a more complete picture of how the distribution of stockholdings vs. wealth and income has changed over the period 1989 to 1995 (see also Table 4). Using data from the SCF, we plot the share of stocks held against the share of income or wealth. Stockholding looks more democratic when measured relative to income than relative to wealth, since as noted in Vissing-Jorgensen (1997), lower-labor-income households own a larger share of the market than in the past. When the metric is wealth, however, there has been very little change-holdings were and are extremely concentrated.   Ideally, one would like to measure the net investment in the stock market in recent years on behalf of households. If net inflows were large, one could perhaps conclude that the demand for stocks had significantly increased. The fact that aggregate savings rates are low is indirect evidence that these net inflows cannot be large. Still, there could be substitution out of money and bonds into stocks, increasing the net flow into stocks. According to the flow-of-funds accounts, U.S. Treasury securities are the only category of fixed-income investment that had a large net outflow from the household sector in recent years. Calculating flows into stocks directly is tricky because there have been large changes in the institutional structure of the investment industry. Table 5, using data from the Investment Company Institute, shows net purchases of stocks, purchases made through mutual funds, and purchases made outside mutual funds, by households, from 1995 to 1997. While purchases made through mutual funds increased significantly over the period, net purchases of equities by households were actually negative in each year. This is because households were net sellers of equities to institutions.",

            "text": "Changes in foreign participation in the U.S. market may also affect expected returns. Assuming that foreign participants are similar to U.S. stockholders in their attitude towards risk and their ex ante risk exposure, an increase in foreign participation should lower expected returns by increasing opportunities for diversification. Net foreign purchases of stock have spiked sharply in recent years (see Figure 4), and these inflows, over the period January 1988 to February 1999, have a correlation of 0.13 with monthly returns on the S&P 500. The average monthly net inflow between January 1996 and February 1999 is $3.8 billion, compared to only $349 million from the period January 1988 to December 1995. Although the inflows have increased significantly, they still represent a small fraction of total market transactions, which totaled approximately $479 billion per month in 1997 on the New York Stock Exchange alone.7 In this section, we ask whether changing stock-market participation patterns and increased diversification can have a quantitatively important effect on stock prices in an equilibrium model. We calibrate an overlapping-generations (OLG) model in which agents face both aggregate and idiosyncratic income risk, and a variable subset of agents has limited access to financial markets. The effects of limited participation in financial markets has been considered by a number of authors, including Basak and Cuoco (1998), Saito (1995), andVissing-Jorgensen (1997). In these papers, aggregate consumption is completely traded in financial markets in the form of dividends. Only a limited number of agents can trade claims on this dividend flow directly. The other agents participate in financial markets only by trading claims to risk-free bonds. The result is incomplete sharing of aggregate risk, with stockholders often taking leveraged posi-tions to accommodate the demand for bonds by nonparticipants. Because of this, a larger risk premium is necessary to induce those in the stock market to hold all of the aggregate risk. It is difficult to justify the magnitude of the observed equity premium in these models, however, unless one assumes very high risk aversion or very low participation rates.",

For instance, income from wages and/or privately held businesses constitutes the majority of income for most households (Heaton and Lucas, 1998). These income flows are difficult to contract upon, and a large component of this income risk is specific to each individual of household. We refer to the sum of labor income and privately held business income as nonmarketed income. Potential differences in the properties of this income for participants versus nonparticipants are likely to influence the effects of limited participation on asset returns. This is consistent with the empirical observation that the consumption of stockholders is more volatile than that of nonstockholders (Mankiw and Zeldes, 1991). Polkovnichenko (1998) demonstrates how differential income risk and risk aversion can affect asset prices in a model with infinite-lived heterogeneous agents. He shows that a small fixed transaction cost that endogenously limits stock-market participation can interact with idiosyncratic risk to result in a bigger equity premium than in a representative agent model, although matching the observed premium is still elusive.",

Then the aggregate state of the economy is given by z(t) = [y(t) d(t)]', which is assumed to be generated by a Markov chain. To calibrate a process for z(t) we assume that a period corresponds to 25 years. The first period roughly corresponds to the working years between age 40 and retirement, and the second period is the time in retirement. Over the period 1889 to 1985, the average annual (log) growth rate in real aggregate consumption was 1.7% with a standard deviation of 3.5%. So that the model will produce a nonnegligible equity premium, we assume that the standard deviation of the aggregate growth rate in the model is 1.5 times the historical standard deviation of aggregate 9.

This distribution is discretized by assuming that y takes on the values 0.16 and 0.69 with equal conditional probability. The capital share in total income averages approximately 30%. Consistent with the aggregate statistics reported in Heaton and Lucas (1998), we assume that only half of this capital income is actually tradable. The nontradable portion, generated by private business holdings, is accounted for in nonmarketed income. Since dividends in the model are scaled relative to nonmarketed income, this means that we require d(t) to average 18%. In most of the calculations d(t) is fixed at 18%. In other experiments described below, we assume a more volatile dividend process to proxy for a lack of diversification.11",

Because preferences are homothetic, when agents are assumed to be homogeneous only the w-shock affects prices and portfolio choice.

As one would expect, increased participation lowers the equity premium. Notice, however, that the effect is small in the region of participation rates that correspond to the data. For example, when participation increases from 50% to 80% of the population, the equity premium and the absolute level of equity returns are reduced by less than a tenth of a percent. Changing participation also has a small effect on the level of the risk-free rate, with an increase in participation increasing the average rate of return. This can be attributed to a precautionary effect that decreases when risk is spread more evenly over the population. Although small, this effect is in keeping with the observation that the risk-free rate has risen in recent years.",

The above statistics on portfolio returns do not translate directly into parameter values, since the inputs into the model are income and dividend processes, whereas returns are endogenous. One assumption about dividends that produces returns consistent with those observed in CRSP data is that d(t) is variable over time, taking on the values 0.11 and 0.25 with equal probability.

The dividend share, 8, is fixed at 0.1865 for 95% of the time, but falls to 0.06 for 5% of the time, independent of the aggregate state. This skewed dividend case represents bankruptcy of a poorly diversified portfolio. It is further assumed that zero is an absorbing state for the value of a bankrupt portfolio after this small dividend is paid. To maintain stationarity, bankrupt shares are replaced by new shares in the new generation. These new shares are held in the portfolios of the young, but cannot be sold until the following period. The reason to consider a more skewed distribution of payoffs is twofold. First, although catastrophic outcomes are rare for the U.S. stock market as a whole, individual firms fail quite frequently. Secondly, the properties of the utility function suggest that skewed outcomes will have a much different effect on asset prices than a symmetric distribution with the same variance. In fact, the implied volatility of returns in this case is set to be similar to that in the case of high dividend volatility. Table 8 is similar to Table 6, but reports results under the assumptions of high dividend volatility, correlated high dividend volatility, and skewed dividends. Panel A reproduces the predicted returns under the base-case set of assumptions for participation rates of 50% and 100%. Relative to panel A, assuming high dividend volatility (panel B) has the effect of decreasing the risk-free rate by 0.61% and 0.82% for participation levels of 100% and 50% respectively. It increases the equity premium by 0.71% and 0.97%, respectively, for the same participation rates. These results are consistent with the view that increased diversification has significantly reduced the required equity premium, although for these parameters it suggests only a slight decrease in the level of the required return on equities. For the case of correlated high dividend volatility (panel C), the effect on the equity premium of an increase in dividend volatility is even larger.",

It is not obvious, however, whether the dividends from a poorly diversified portfolio are likely to be more or' less highly correlated with nonmarketed income than for a well-diversified portfolio.

For correlated high dividend volatility, however, changes in participation have a smaller effect on the equity premium than for uncorrelated high dividend volatility. This is because the new entrants are less willing to bear stock-market risk when it is correlated with their nonmarketed risk. Finally, the much more dramatic results in the skewed-dividend case are shown in panel D. The small risk of a catastrophic outcome reduces the risk-free rate to 0.47% and increases the equity premium to 6.46% with 50% participation.

In Heaton and Lucas (1998) we present evidence that many large stockholders depend more heavily on income from privately held businesses than on labor income. Business income is more volatile and more highly correlated with stock returns than is labor income. Hence, the equity premium is likely to fall more sharply if new entrants who are otherwise similar to stockholders depend predominantly on labor income. As discussed in Section 3.2, in recent years there has been an increase in participation by middle-income households, which are likely to contain wage earners. We investigate the potential quantitative effect of this change by assuming a different idiosyncratic income process for a subset of the stockholders and for nonstockholders.13",

New entrants to the stock market and nonparticipants have a less correlated income process. More precisely, we assume that 25% of the population receive idiosyncratic income when old, with a standard deviation of 67.5% and a correlation with dividends' share in aggregate income of 0.2. this group is always assumed to hold stocks.14 The rest of the population receives idiosyncratic shocks that have a standard deviation of 45% as before, and a correlation with dividends of -0.1. This negative correlation is necessary to produce an average correlation that is consistent with data. In annual data, one does in fact see a slight negative correlation between labor income and stock returns. Table 9 reports results under these assumptions for high dividend volatility (panel A), correlated high dividend volatility (panel B), and skewed dividends (panel C). In each case, the experiment is to move from a situation in which 50% of the stockholding population is exposed to high background risk to one in which 25% has this exposure. Changes in participation now have only slightly more effect than in Table 8 for high dividend volatility. The effect of a change in participation is slightly smaller for skewed dividends.

We have seen that none of these factors alone is sufficient to produce a large change in required equity returns, and hence the large run-up in stock prices. Here we examine the best case for the model, simultaneously changing a number of parameters. The stylized historical past is characterized by a P of 0.9525, dividends as described in the skewed-dividend case, and a participation rate of 50%. Income processes are heterogeneous as described in the previous subsection, so that 50% of stockholders have highly volatile income that is correlated with dividends. The risk aversion a is fixed at 5, and 77 is fixed at 0.2. The stylized present is described by a P of 0.9625, reflecting an upward revision of expected life expectancy, low-volatility dividends as in Table 6 reflecting a considerable increase in diversification, and a participation rate of 80%. All else is as in the past. This results in a risk-free rate that rises from 0.17% to 3.73%, and an expected return on stocks that decreases from 6.82% to 4.84%. The equity premium is substantially reduced, from 6.65% to 1.11%. We conclude, then, that assuming reasonable changes in a number of variables simultaneously can account for changes in expected returns in keeping with what appears to be the case in the U.S. economy.",

            "text": "In this paper, we have looked at a number of potential fundamentalsbased explanations for the recent stock price run-up. In particular, we focused on whether changes in market participation patterns or changes in portfolio diversification are likely to account for a substantial fraction of the rise in stock prices. We conclude that the changes in participation that have occurred over this decade are unlikely to be a major part of the explanation. This conclusion is based both on the data, which suggest only small changes in participation for wealthy households, and the model, which implies that participation changes have to be quite extreme to substantially affect expected returns. Increased portfolio diversification, however, is likely to have had a larger effect. There is empirical evidence that households have significantly diversified their portfolios, selling individual stocks and buying mutual funds. An important differ-ence between poorly diversified portfolios and a market index is the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes. When this difference is reflected in model parameters, the expected equity premium falls by more than 4%. More generally, we can construct scenarios that are loosely consistent with the data in which the required return on stocks falls by 2%. As shown in Section 3.1 using a calibrated Gordon growth model, this amount of change in expected returns goes at least halfway towards justifying the current high level of the price-dividend ratio in the U.S. market. We interpret this as quite a positive result, especially because it is difficult to produce much variation in the predicted equity premium in this class of models. The model also predicts an increase in the real risk-free rate, which also appears to be consistent with the data.",

There is evidence that entrepreneurs and managers tend to be large stockholders who bear a sizable amount of undiversifiable risk in the form of their own businesses. Still, we do not have a complete picture of the income and wealth characteristics of large stockholders, and we are uncertain about the extent of their diversification. We also do not have a satisfactory understanding of how older stockholders, who own a substantial fraction of the market, view the risk of stock ownership. Looking even more closely at the characteristics of large stockholders remains a useful direction for future research.",

Suppose as a rough approximation that annual real log gross stock returns are normally distributed and independent over time. With a mean and variance of this distribution equal to the historical values for the period 1871-1994, the probability of observing four years of above 20% returns is 0.4%.1 The high returns have come primarily from capital gains driving pricedividend and price-earnings ratios to historical highs (the latest numbers from August 9 for the S&P 500 are P/D = 78.5 and P/E = 31.9). Thus, even taking into account statistical fluctuation, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that nothing has changed. The only period since 1871 with as impressive returns was 1924-1928, with five years of above 20% real stock returns. Over the three-year period following that event, real stock returns averaged -15.4% annually.",

Three candidates are considered: changes in corporate earnings growth, changes in consumer preferences, and changes in stock-market participation patterns. Participation is defined broadly as concerning both the level of stock-market participation and the amount of diversification among participants. Poor diversification is found to have large effects on equilibrium returns in an overlapping generations exchange economy. The main conclusion of the paper is that increased diversification by itself can explain at least half of the increase in the adjusted P/D ratio. This is an interesting finding, not only for interpreting the recent past but also seen in the context of the literature on the equity premium",
