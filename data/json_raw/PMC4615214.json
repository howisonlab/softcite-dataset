            "text": "P rotein-coding and non-coding RNA transcripts perform a wide variety of cellular functions in diverse organisms. Several of their functional roles are expressed and modulated via RNA structure. A given transcript, however, can have more than a single functional RNA structure throughout its life, a fact which has been previously overlooked. Transient RNA structures, for example, are only present during specific time intervals and cellular conditions. We here introduce four RNA families with transient RNA structures that play distinct and diverse functional roles. Moreover, we show that these transient RNA structures are structurally well-defined and evolutionarily conserved. Since RFAM annotates one structure for each family, there is either no annotation for these transient structures or no such family. Thus, our alignments either significantly update and extend the existing RFAM families or introduce a new RNA family to RFAM. For each of the four RNA families, we compile a multiplesequence alignment based on experimentally verified transient and dominant (dominant in terms of either the thermodynamic stability and/or attention received so far) RNA secondary structures using a combination of automated search via covariance model and manual curation. The first alignment is the Trp operon leader which regulates the operon transcription in response to tryptophan abundance through alternative structures. The second alignment is the HDV ribozyme which we extend to the 5 0 flanking sequence. This flanking sequence is involved in the regulation of the transcript's self-cleavage activity. The third alignment is the 5 0 UTR of the maturation protein from Levivirus",

These RNA structures and the functional roles they play, for example in regulating the transcription and translation of eukaryotic genes, have been the subject of intense study for several decades.

Several studies have discovered RNA molecules with multiple structures which each plays a distinct functional role at different times of the molecule's life. One early example of sequences with more than one functional RNA structure is so-called riboswitch [2][3][4] which consists of two distinct, mutually exclusive RNA structures each with a distinct functional role. We thus need to start looking beyond the one-sequence-onestructure dogma to appreciate that one RNA sequence can have more than one functional structure throughout its cellular life and to understand the mechanisms underlying their regulation.",

Moreover, our previous research 14 shows that the computationally predicted co-transcriptional folding pathways for homologous RNA sequences go through similar transient structural configurations, thus supporting our hypothesis that evolutionarily related RNA sequences co-transcriptionally fold in similar ways whose features have been partly conserved. Overall, the functional and structural annotation of any RNA family should thus naturally include any conserved transient and alternative strutures with functional roles. Right now, however, RFAM 1 only specifies a single functional structure for each RNA family. The RFAM database of RNA families 1 features three of them -Trp operon leader (RF00513), HDV ribozyme (RF00094), SAM riboswitch (RF00162) -but lacks the annotation and alignment for the alternative structures. More specifically, RFAM features the terminator structure of Trp operon leader, but misses the anti-terminator structure; for HDV ribozyme, the active self-cleavage structure is included, but the repressive and permissive structures involving the 5' flanking sequence of the cleavage site are missing; for the SAM riboswitch, though most of the SAM-bound structure is included, the corresponding alignment and annotation for the terminator hairpin and the SAM-unbound structure are absent. The Levivirus family is completely new and not yet part of RFAM. In order to provide more complete structural annotations including conserved transient and alternative structures, we set up a pipeline involving INFERNAL program 92 to structurally align sequences for multiple structures. We here show that it is possible to go beyond the one-sequence-one-structure dogma by providing carefully curated alignment annotated by both transient/ alternative and dominant structures for the four RNA alignments (section 1 of Supplementary Material contains the alignments, CM files and initial structures/sequence identified from literature).",

In the past, the terminator structure responsible for producing the 140 nt-long attenuated leader transcript has been investigated via experimental approaches. Lee and Yanofsky (1977) concluded that the termination efficiency at the attenuator is correlated with the stability of an embedded secondary structure which is conserved between E. coli and Salmonnella typhimurium; the proposed structures agree with results of a partial RNase T1 digestion that exhibit digestion resistance in the distal portion of this transcript, i.e., where the structural features are located. 32 Thereafter, Oxender et al. (1979) conducted structural probing with RNase T1 partial digestion followed by isolation of the comigrating pairing regions in a non-denaturing gel electrophoresis; the base-pairing regions were subsequently identified via denaturing gel electrophoresis and fingerprinting, based on which the two hairpins comprising the terminator structure were drawn. 33 Later on, the secondary structure of DNA template was ruled out as a contributor for this termination signal so the RNA structural features are the one causing the termination. 9,38,39 Indeed, the functional importance of the second hairpin for the transcriptional termination is illustrated by the reduced transcription termination frequency observed in experiments destabilising the central GCC pairing of this hairpin, such as by in vivo mutational analysis or in vitro substitution of G-C bond by I-C bond. 32,[40][41][42] Moreover, mutational analysis progressively disrupting the first hairpin still preserves the production of the attenuated transcript, suggesting that the second hairpin itself is sufficient for the termination. 9,42 Anti-terminator structure Anti-terminator structure disrupts the two terminator hairpins",

            "text": "The family Leviviridae, a prevalent family targeting gram-negative bacteria, comprises positive single-stranded (ss) RNA bacteriophages with one of the smallest genome sizes (around 3500 to 4200 nt). [44][45][46][47] Most of the family members exhibit infection specificity for E. coli bearing F pilus receptors; moreover, the family members exploit similar mechanisms and host factors for replication and translational regulation. 44 This family was proposed to be a monophyletic group with main constituent genera Levivirus and Allolevivirus based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation using the coat and replicase genes of nine species. 44 Levivirus and Allolevivirus have difference in the genes encoded and the orientation of the open reading frame (ORF), albeit both having four genes. 44 Each of these two genera is further sub-divided into two groups according to their serological cross-reactivity and the characteristics of the virion. 44,45,48,49 Among them, MS2 and GA are the typical species of Group I, II of the Levivirus, respectively; Qb and SP are the representative ones of Group III and IV of the Allolevivirus, respectively. 44,50 Structure of 5 0 UTR of maturation gene solves the competition between translation and replication on ssRNA template MS2, a model organism for Group I coli-phage of Levivirus, has a sense RNA genome encoding four proteins (starting from the 5 0 end): maturation, coat, lysis, and replicase. 8,51 Both maturation and coat proteins serve as the structural component of the icosahedral virion, presenting a per-virion ratio of 1:180. 8 The lysis protein lyses the host cell; the replicase and host factors comprise a holoenzyme responsible for the replication of strands in both polarities. 8 As a result of the RNA genome, transcriptional regulatory tools are no longer available and the viral gene expression is thus regulated translationally to achieve the desired quantity and timing pertaining to these proteins. 8 As Levivirus has a ss RNA genome serving as the template for both translation and replication, the ribosome and the replicase tend to compete in binding the template. 8 To solve this conflict, the three distal genes share a single ribosomal entry site; moreover, the ribosome and replicase share the same binding site around the start codon of the coat gene. 7,8,52,53 The translation of the three distal genes is therefore coupled as the binding of replicase and of ribosome is mutually exclusive. 7 Nevertheless, ribosome bound to the ORF of the maturation gene could potentially dislodge the replicase travelling to the 5 0 end. 7 To prevent this, transcript folding can exert a translational control by gate-keeping the ribosomal binding site(RBS) in a long-distance interaction (LDI) via an inhibitory upstream complementary sequence (UCS). 8 This structure prevents the binding of the ribosome and yields way to the replicase. 8,54 The translation of maturation protein is thus usually suppressed. When the formation of the secondary structure is prevented, translation increases. 8,55 Expression of the maturation protein is key for the viral infection process as it can proteolytically trigger the releasing of viral genome through contacting the F-pili of male; this only requires low copies of the maturation protein in Escherichia coli. 8,56 The virus employs a co-transcriptional folding strategy to postpone the formation of this inhibitory LDI via sequestering the UCS in a metastable hairpin, enabling a transient translation of maturation protein. 7 Moreover, studying this translational control of the maturation protein brings deeper insight into the evolutionary divergence of Levivirus and Allolevivirus in the Family Leviviridae. 44 Gene expansion is proposed to have occurred in Allolevivirus, which postpones the formation of the inhibitory LDI and therefore up-regulates the maturation protein; subsequent mutations accumulate and restore the virus fitness, resulting in the difference between these two genera. 44,57 Final inhibitory Structure The final cloverleaf-like structure consists of four hairpins",

            "text": "The cloverleaf-like structure assumed by the 5 0 UTR of equilibrated RNA from MS2 was first proposed by Groeneveld et al. (1995), consisting of a 5 0 hairpin, and the downstream West (W), South (S) and East (E) arms 7,8  (Fig. 2). An inhibitory UCS, immediately 3 0 to the 5 0 hairpin, pairs with the 7 nt Shine-Dalgarno(SD, AGGAGGU) sequence, forming a LDI. 8 This cloverleaf-like structure, even including the bulge in the bottom of the S arm, is evolutionarily conserved between MS2 and KU1 which is a Group II Levivirus that varies from MS2 in terms of primary sequence. 8 The cloverleaf-like and inactive structure forms once the first 123 nt of the plus-strand is synthesised. 7 Meanwhile, the start codon is not replicated yet, and the translation initiation complex requires the transcript up to the first 145 nt. 7 The maturation protein can therefore not be translated. 7 The RBS of the maturation protein spanning from nucleotide 110 to 145 can also pair with a stretch of downstream sequence to further sequester the RNA molecule in an inactive form. 8 This ensures that the RBS is not accessible to the ribosome once the inactive cloverleaf structure is formed, otherwise the ribosome could be there to dislodge the progressing replicase. 8 Experimental evidence Phylogenetic analysis reveals the conservation of the cloverleaf structure in the 5 0 UTR sequences of the maturation gene among Levivirus members: Groeneveld et al. (1995) assembled an alignment consisting of four group I phages (fr, M12, JP501, MS2), and two group II phages (KU1, GA). 8 They noticed that the structural features are generally preserved, albeit some variations in the W arm comparing the two groups and bulge shifting in the S arm comparing MS2 and M12. 8,58,59 They also reported covariation being observed in all arms and, most importantly, in the LDI; particularly, the amount of covariations present in Group I and II are similar. 8 In addition, they were able to employ the secondary-structure prediction program MFOLD (GCG sofware, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) to predict the cloverleaf structure. 8 Biochemical probing of the structure from a reference MS2 sequence is initialised as well using a combination of DMS, DEP, CMCT, and RNase T1/T2/VT. 8 The resultant probing pattern is consistent with the proposed structure in terms of sensitivity to modification or cleavage, including the bulge region. 8 Functional analyses have been conducted on the components of this cloverleaf structure through a series of mutants with deletions in variable portions of the arms. 8 Any changes in the synthesis of the maturation protein were thus attributed to the structural feature being mutated because the stability of these mutant RNAs was confirmed to be unchanged. 8 Only the base-pairing potential rather than the primary sequence composition of the W arm is required for maturation protein translation. 8 Moreover, deleting the entire UCS sequence or destabilising the LDI via mutations significantly enhances the maturation protein synthesis, which is further evidence for the negative regulatory role of the UCS strand. 8 ",

(1997) proposed a kinetic model to explain the brief translation of maturation protein, a series of MS2 mutants were designed by Van Meerten et al. (2001) to progressively locate the kinetic trap that contributes to the slow folding of the cloverleaf-like structure. 7,60 This temporary kinetic trap, essentially a transient structure, is located in the 5 0 UTR. 7 The precise position was further explored by replacing the W, S and E arms of MS2 arm by arm by the cognate arm from KU1. 7 Finally, nt 37-45 of MS2, residing in the 5 0 segment of the W arm, was identified as the functional sequence corresponding to the 3 0 portion of a metastable hairpin which is conserved among MS2, KU1 and fr. 7 This transient hairpin encompasses 4 nts from the 3 0 portion of the 5 0 hairpin, the UCS, and 7 nts from the 5 0 portion of the West arm originally in the cloverleaflike structure. 7 Therefore, it disrupts the inhibitory LDI and thereafter frees the SD sequence, temporarily permitting the nonequilibrated RNA to be captured by the translation machinery for a brief translation of the maturation protein during the limited time window, i.e., after the synthesis of the RBS but before the LDI forms. 7 Moreover, this truncates the 5 0 hairpin and exposes the G 0 s at the start of the 5 0 UTR as ss, which is stipulated by the viral replication; maturation protein complemented in trans is not enough to rescue a mutant with no metastable hairpin, which agrees with this additional role. 7 This structure forms only co-transcriptionally during the synthesis of the positive strand from an antisense template, and will be eventually replaced by the mutually exclusive LDI. 7 This requires the ribosome to bind the RBS fast enough compared to the formation of the LDI, 8 which is demonstrated feasible. 61 Experimental evidence Firstly, Groeneveld et al. indirectly tested the kinetic model by delineating the maturation protein synthesis contributed from the equilibrium model; the latter model states that RBS is occasionally freed from UCS during breathing if the fullybound LDI forms faster than ribosome Figure 2. Schematic drawing for Levivirus (MS2). The UCS is highlighted in red color, the SD sequence is in yellow color, and the start codon is colored in green. In the left structure, the SD sequence is accessible to ribosome for translation. In the right structure, the SD pairs with the UCS, forming the LDI to impede ribosome binding.",

Mutants with the metastable hairpin disrupted produce no plaque whereas compensatory double mutation is able to rescue the fitness of the phage. 7 On the other hand, mutation stabilising the metastable structure via replacing the bulge by a base pair increases the translation of maturation. 7 Furthermore, bulk evolution of those mutants with no metastable hairpin eventually leads to the restoration of the metastable hairpin. 7 Taken together, they imply the necessity of the metastable hairpin for the synthesis of maturation protein and thus the infection fitness of the phage.",

That is, alternative structures formed co-transcriptionally and being mutually exclusive to the active conformation could potentially temporarily adjust the HDV ribozyme activity. 12 This would require a thorough investigation of the co-transcriptional folding kinetics of the HDV ribozyme incorporating the 5 0 upstream sequence. 13 Here, we summarise the findings in one inhibitory and one permissive structure for the HDV ribozyme self-cleaving activity. 12 Active structure Active conformation consists of 5 stems: P1, P1.1, P2, P3, P4. 64  (Fig. 3) The active double-pseudo-knotted structure assumes a nested structure folding the active site inside a catalytic cleft to shield it against the solvents. 64 Coaxial stacking occurs among P1, P1.1 and P4; Figure 4.

            "text": "Due to the rapid self-cleavage of the HDV ribozyme, the ribonuclease experiments were performed on the 3 0 self-cleavage product rather than the precursor. 72 An extended transcript extending from 30 nt upstream of the cleavage site to 15 nt downstream of the 3 0 -end, denoted as \u00a130/99 RNA, was found to have extremely diminished activity. 12 The flanking sequence kinetically traps the ribozyme during transcription and results in a slow reaction rate, which can be improved by the addition of heat and denaturants to facilitate the formation of the active conformation. 12,71,72 Alt1, Alt2 and Alt3 disrupt the P1.1, P2 and P3 stems in the active conformation, as revealed by the biochemical, computational, and mutational studies conducted by Chadalavada et al. (2000); in contrast, P1 and P4 remain the native conformation. 12 P2 is proposed to form prior to the remaining HDV ribozyme and activate both genomic and antigenomic ribozyme, which may explain the resultant inactive conformation. 12,79,80 Alt1 is a 10-bp LDI formed between an upstream inhibitory stretch (nt \u00a125/-15 related to the cleavage site) and the downstream stretch (nt 76/86). 12,81,82 Alt2 is an interaction between upstream flanking sequence and the ribozyme, and Alt3 is a non-native ribozyme-ribozyme interaction. 12 Experimental evidence Three experimental approaches provide evidence for the inhibitory secondary structure. 12 Firstly, this extended transcript was directly probed via ribonucleases due to its slow self-cleaving rate, and the cleavage results were used to constrain the structural prediction by MFOLD 3.0, yielding the structure shown in Figure 7. 12 Secondly, a series of DNA oligomers were used to rescue the ribozyme activity of this inactive transcript. 12 Among the oligomers, AS1 anneals to the entire upstream inhibitory stretch of Alt1, raising the reactivity rate by 2700-to 20,000-fold; AS2 only partially disrupts Alt1, nevertheless, it still accelerates the reactivity by 14-fold. 12 These two oligomers have no additive effect since sequestering either portion of Alt1 is sufficient for disrupting this inhibitory LDI. 12 Thirdly, mutations were introduced outside the ribozyme to ensure that the observed ribozyme activity is caused by the stability of Alt1. 12 Single mutations, destabilising Alt1, exhibit 150-fold increase in the reactivity rate or even co-transcriptional selfcleavage; double compensatory mutation, restoring Alt1, has similar reactivity to the inactive RNA transcript. 12 Upon addition of AS1, these mutants show similar reactivity rate to the active ribozyme. 12 Lastly, Alt1 and Alt 3 are conserved among 21 genomic isolates. 12 These non-native structures are conserved perhaps due to their potential role in facilitating the formation of the genome rod-like structure which is required for replication and packaging. 12 Structure permitting selfcleavage Self-cleavage-permissive structure is an upstream hairpin",

The right legend specifies the evolutionary support (e.g., covariation, etc.) for each position in the alignment. The alignment and arcs at the top show the information for the terminator structure, whereas the bottom ones correspond to the anti-terminator structure for the same underlying alignment. The lines in each alignment correspond to the respective sequences with every box representing either a nucleotide or a gap in the respective sequence. Every arc represents a base-pair involving the respective two alignment columns. The arcs are colour-coded according to their percentage of canonical base pairs, whereas the evolutionary information supporting each base pair is encoded in the colouring of the underlying nucleotides in the base paired alignment columns, see the right legend for details. Two green blocks connected by an arc implies that this is a canonical base pair (i.e., GC, AU or GU) which corresponds to the most abundant type of base pair for this pair of alignment columns. Cyan means this is a canonical base pair but that it has an one-sided mutation with respect to the most abundant (green) base-pair. Blue refers to a canonical base-pair which differs on both sides from the most abundant (green) base-pair. Red means this is a non-canonical base pair.

            "text": "Riboswitches are proposed to be regulatory mechanisms that derive from the RNA world. 85,86 They correspond to non-coding RNA structure elements located in the leader sequence of mRNA strands, which selectively bind certain metabolites to regulate the synthesis of downstream products relevant to this metabolite. [2][3][4]11,87 This regulatory response is achieved by the coordination between the embedded metabolite-binding aptamer domain and the expression platform which switches between alternative structures upon sensing a change in the aptamer domain when a metabolite binds. 3,4,11 The riboswitch can generally assume two mutually-exclusive structures -one metabolite-bound, and one metaboliteunbound. This ligand recognition via aptamer can sequentially affect the interaction between the mRNA and the translational or transcriptional apparatus. 88 The structure of the aptamer is typically evolutionarily conserved; for instance, the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) riboswitch discussed in this paper is well conserved among bacteria species. 11 In SAM riboswitch, S box is the aptamer where the coenzyme SAM binds with high affinity, which often precedes a putative transcription terminator hairpin; the binding of SAM triggers an allosteric change that subsequently terminates the transcription. 11,89 Overall, a riboswitch assigns the same mRNA both a sensory and an action role without requiring an intermediate. 90 This amounts to a speedy and sensitive responsive mechanism that is able to sense the conditions of the cellular environment with an accuracy comparable to mechanisms involving protein factors. 11,90 Sam-unbound structure If the SAM is unbound, the anti-terminator sequence can sequester the terminator sequence to prevent the formation of terminator and the polymerase can progress through the downstream gene 11  (Fig. 4). The structure without binding of SAM was derived from in vitro transcription and in-line probing using the first Figure 6. Arc-plot for the Levivirus alignment. The alignment and arcs at the top correspond to the final inhibitory structure, whereas the bottom ones correspond to the transient structure permissive for maturation protein translation.

These small MSAs are of a high-quality with positive covariation and few gaps, making them convenient starting points to build the corresponding primary CMs. For each of our four alignments, we aligned the sequences of the seed alignment in RFAM with the primary CM first and then curated this against all experimentally verified structures which were first mapped to a reference sequence. We then build a secondary CM incorporating sequences from the RFAM seed alignment which we used to align the hits returned by the search Figure 7. Arc-plot for the HDV ribozyme.

The functional roles of these transient structures are diverse and comprise transcription regulation (Trp operon and SAM riboswitch), self-cleavage (HDV ribozyme) and translation regulation (Levivirus 5 0 UTR). Moreover, we show for all four alignments that both the dominant and transient structures are evolutionarily conserved. Our four alignments and structural annotations either significantly update and extend the existing RFAM family or introduce a new RNA family.",

            "text": "Overall, we hope to make that the case that the structural annotation of any RNA family ought to naturally also comprise functional transient RNA structures. This will not only require further experimental research regarding their structure determination and the study of their functional roles, but also some adjustments in RFAM. It should be fairly easy to provide a dedicated structural annotation for each functional role for a given RNA family. It will be more difficult to extend seed alignments in RFAM into full alignments using the current computational analysis pipeline of RFAM as more than one covariance model may be required to capture both the dominant and transient RNA structures of a given RNA family. Finally, translating experimental evidence into a structural annotation of an RNA family, as shown here for four families, is not always a straightforward task for transient structures and may require more manual curation and expertise. Ribonuclease probing, for example, of regions embedded in alternative structures may display only minor hits, rendering the interpretation ambiguous. 72 A concerted effort using a variety of experimental techniques as well as more sophisticated computational analysis tools will thus be required to arrive at complete structural annotations that also comprise functional transient structures.",

Secondly, redundant sequences are removed from this expanded alignment (i.e., sequence from pre-assembled alignment + RFAM seed alignment), which is subsequently manually curated to optimise the covariation for all alternative structures. Curation is initiated on the alignment generated by the CM with the structure with the largest number of base pairs, and the other alternative structural features are mapped onto the same alignment. During curation, RALEE 94 is used to visually compare the resultant alignments generated by the covariation models pertaining to each alternative structure, and structural overlapping regions are identified and then manually curated (section 4.1 (iv) of Supplementary Material).
