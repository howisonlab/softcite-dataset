Methods and Results-Hypothesizing that acculturation (length of residence) would be associated with a higher prevalence of CMR factors, the authors analyzed data on 54, 984 US immigrants in the 2010-2014 National Health Interview Surveys. The main predictor was length of residence. The outcomes were hypertension, overweight/obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The authors used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between length of US residence and these CMR factors.The mean (SE) age of the patients was 43 (0.12) years and half were women. Participants residing in the United States for \u226510 years were more likely to have health insurance than those with <10 years of residence (70% versus 54%, P<0.001). After adjusting for region of birth, poverty income ratio, age, and sex, immigrants residing in the United States for \u226510 years were more likely to be overweight/obese (odds ratio [",

Generally, immigrants are significantly less likely to graduate from high school compared with nonimmigrants, have lower earnings than US-born residents, 10,11 and are more likely not to have health insurance compared with nonimmigrant whites. 10,11 However, immigrants have been found to have high levels of social support. 12,13 Some studies have shown that high social support is associated with superior health outcomes among immigrants. 14,15 Acculturation, a unique characteristic in immigrants, to some extent is associated with social support and the assimilation of immigrants to the host's sociocultural environment. 16 Acculturation is defined as \"the dual process of cultural and psychological change that takes place as a result of contact between two or more cultures and their individual members.\" 16,17 Proxy measures of acculturation such as length of US residence 18 and languages spoken at home are commonly used in lieu of lengthy scales in population-based studies to minimize participant burden. Acculturation has been associated with poorer health outcomes among US immigrants. 19 Prior studies have indicated that acculturation is associated with increased prevalence of CMR factors among Asian, Hispanic, European, and black immigrants. [20][21][22][23][24] Given the growing size of immigrants in the US and the economic burden associated with CMR, examining the association between acculturation and CMR factors among immigrants in the US may provide further insight on how to frame public health interventions to reduce CMR and associated sequelae among immigrants in the US.",

Building on findings of Koya and Egede, 25 we re-examined the association between acculturation and CMR factors among a contemporary, diverse, and larger sample of US immigrants. This study sought more specifically to examine (1) prevalence of CMR factors by length of residence (ie, acculturation) in the US of immigrants, and (2) differences in the association between CMR factors and acculturation among US immigrants stratified by sex. We hypothesize that increased length of stay of immigrants in the US would be associated with much greater odds of CMR factors than recently arrived immigrants to the US. We also theorize that the association between length of residence of immigrants in the US with CMR factors would vary by sex.",

We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to determine the association between length of US residence and overweight/obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, adjusting for known confounders. For each of the four outcomes (overweight/obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia), we fitted 3 multiple logistic regression models with length of US residence as the main predictor (reference group <10 years) controlling for age, poverty status, health insurance, sex, and region of birth. In addition to these covariates, BMI was included as a covariate in the model with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia as the outcomes. These covariates were included because of their clinical importance, our bivariate findings, and previous studies, which have shown that these variables confound the relationship between acculturation and CMR factors. 25,30 A 2-tailed alpha with P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

            "text": "We sought to examine the contribution of acculturation, operationalized as length of US residence, on the prevalence of CMR factors in a contemporary and ethnically diverse sample of immigrants. Our findings support our hypothesis that increased years of US residence is associated with a higher prevalence of CMR factors, specifically hypertension, overweight/obesity, and diabetes mellitus. However, we did not observe an association between acculturation and hyperlipidemia in this study. Several lines of evidence have shown that acculturation to Western society is associated with hypertension. [31][32][33][34] Acculturation is said to increase blood pressure (BP) through stressors associated with migration and cultural and behavioral changes (in diet, physical activity, smoking) that occur after migration. Regarding the stress pathway, acculturation to Western society is associated with a decrease in social support (a protective factor) and increased job demands, 35,36 which contribute to hypertension. While migration to the US creates an avenue for employment and economic well-being, the stress of adjusting to a new environment contributes to BP elevation. A meta-analysis by Steffen et al 31 examining the strength of the association between acculturation and BP observed that overall effect sizes associated with acculturation were 0.28 for systolic BP and 0.30 for diastolic BP, with increasing acculturation to Western society related to higher BP. Immigrants with higher levels of acculturation had an average of 4 mm Hg higher BP than those with lower levels of acculturation; this is similar to the effect sizes of traditional CMR factors including poor diet and physical inactivity. Migration results in changes in obesogenic behaviors and environments that contribute to overweight/obesity. Prior studies have found that immigrants from low-to mediumincome countries who have migrated to and reside in highincome countries are more susceptible to overweight and obesity than their local counterparts. 37,38 The unhealthy weight gain is estimated to occur after 10 to 15 years of residence in the host country, after which the overweight and obesity rates approach or exceed that of the host population. 39,40 Several studies have also shown positive correlations between length of residence in high-income countries and weight gain. 41,42 In our study, we observed that for both sexes, even after adjusting for known sociodemographic variables, those residing in the US for more than a decade were more likely to be overweight/obese than newer residents. Two factors may account for this phenomenon. First, dietary acculturation-shifts from traditional diets of vegetables, meats, and whole grains to highly processed, high-fat, and high-sugar foods that are popular and readily available in the US 43 -occurs when immigrants migrate to the US. The limited availability of ethnic foods in the host country may compound this problem, with immigrants choosing readily available unhealthy foods, such as snacks and fast food, over their traditional diets. Second, physical activity levels may change upon migration to the US. Physical activity acculturation and the increased frequency of sedentary activities with increased years of US residence contribute to overweight/obesity. 43 Prior studies of Asian and Hispanic immigrants suggest that higher acculturation may be associated with less physical activity. 43,44 Since low-income and low educational status are strongly associated with low leisuretime physical activity, 45 it is likely that socioeconomic challenges that immigrants face may limit their ability to engage in leisure-time physical activity. Culturally tailored programs to improve physical activity levels in immigrants may improve CMR factors but also prevent diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and heart attacks. Behavioral changes that occur upon migration to the US may contribute to the development of diabetes mellitus in immigrants. Prior studies 46,47 have observed mixed findings on the association between acculturation and diabetes mellitus; this is not unusual because the health effects of acculturation vary by country of origin. Although our findings suggest that immigrants residing in the US for more than a decade have higher odds of reporting a diabetes mellitus diagnosis, it is possible that this relationship may not be consistent across all of the regions examined. The association between acculturation and diabetes mellitus was stronger in male immigrants than female immigrants, a finding consistent with a previous study in Latinos where acculturation was assessed with length of residence, language proficiency, current and desired environments, and ethnic identity. 48 Using the NHIS 2007-2010, Brian et al 49 also observed that acculturation, measured with nativity, language spoken at home, and length of US residence, was associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus in US Latino adults, a relationship only partly explained by BMI and weight-related behaviors such as total dietary calories and physical inactivity. Notably, most studies examining the relationship between acculturation and CMR factors in immigrants have focused primarily on Hispanic and Asian immigrants with very few addressing other immigrant population.",

This finding conflicts with findings from Koya et al 25 of higher odds of hyperlipidemia with increasing years of US residence in men but not women. In the landmark Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), Rodriguez et al 50 observed that longer US residence was associated with higher odds of hyperlipidemia awareness, treatment, and control. Given the impact of hyperlipidemia on cardiometabolic outcomes, it is important that additional studies be conducted in various immigrant groups to understand how the acculturation process may influence the development and treatment of hyperlipidemia.",

While this may not be a direct measure of utilization of health screening services, it raises the possibility of bias and under-reporting of CMR factors as a result of underdiagnosis in newer immigrants even after adjusting for this as a possible confounder. It is possible that more acculturated immigrants report CMR/diseases because they are more likely than newer immigrants to have had adequate evaluation and diagnoses by healthcare providers.",

First, CMR factors were obtained through self-report, as is all information in the NHIS; it is possible that the prevalence of hypertension, overweight/ obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia may be overestimated or underestimated. The limitation is inherent in the NHIS as all information is obtained through self-report. It is also difficult to ascertain whether language barriers in the participants who were not native English speakers affected the accuracy of the self-reported data. Second, length of US residence is one of several proxy measures of acculturation and does not fully reflect the complex process of acculturation like validated bidimensional acculturation measures. Third, the cross-sectional nature of our study precludes us from making any causal inferences. Fourth, it is also possible that there may be residual confounding, which may account for the association between length of US residence and the prevalence of these CMR factors. Fifth, the sample represents only immigrants from broadly defined groups who participated in the NHIS, and our findings may not apply to the entire immigrant population in the US.",

Immigrants residing in the US for \u226510 years were more likely to report a history of hypertension, overweight/obesity, and diabetes mellitus but not hyperlipidemia than those who had resided in the US for <10 years. As the US continues to diversify, it is important to understand the evolution of CMR factors in new immigrants to prevent adverse health outcomes such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and kidney disease. Because different acculturation experiences among immigrants in the US may contribute to their risk for CMR factors, it may be necessary to examine unique associations between CMR factors and acculturation separately among US immigrant subgroups. Future longitudinal studies of diverse immigrant groups may provide crucial information on which socioeconomic, behavioral, environmental, and epigenetic factors contribute to CMR in immigrants to inform the development of culturally tailored interventions to mitigate CMR. Specifically, research examining the uptake of primary care and health screening services between newer versus long-term immigrants is needed. Targeted interventions to screen for CMR factors and educate immigrant populations are also needed.",
