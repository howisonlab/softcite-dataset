            "text": "Motivation: For the biologist, running bioinformatics analyses involves a time-consuming management of data and tools. Users need support to organize their work, retrieve parameters and reproduce their analyses. They also need to be able to combine their analytic tools using a safe data flow software mechanism. Finally, given that scientific tools can be difficult to install, it is particularly helpful for biologists to be able to use these tools through a web user interface. However, providing a web interface for a set of tools raises the problem that a single web portal cannot offer all the existing and possible services: it is the user, again, who has to cope with data copy among a number of different services. A framework enabling portal administrators to build a network of cooperating services would therefore clearly be beneficial. Results: We have designed a system, Mobyle, to provide a flexible and usable Web environment for defining and running bioinformatics analyses. It embeds simple yet powerful data management features that allow the user to reproduce analyses and to combine tools using a hierarchical typing system. Mobyle offers invocation of services distributed over remote Mobyle servers, thus enabling a federated network of curated bioinformatics portals without the user having to learn complex concepts or to install sophisticated software. While being focused on the end user, the Mobyle system also addresses the need, for the bioinfomatician, to automate remote services execution: PlayMOBY is a companion tool that automates the publication of BioMOBY web services, using Mobyle program definitions.",

            "text": "Several systems propose a solution to automate the access to bioinformatics resources. Web-based user interfaces, such as the Biology Workbench (Subramaniam, 1998), PISE (Letondal, 2001), wEMBOSS (Sarachu and Colet, 2005), Galaxy (Giardine et al., 2005), GenePattern (Reich et al., 2006), MOWServ (Navas-Delgado et al., 2006), the New Generation Biology Workbench (Rifaieh et al., 2007), BioManager (Cattley and Arthur, 2007) and BioExtract (Lushbough et al., 2008), simplify the access to powerful computer resources by providing a familiar graphical-based environment for inexperienced users and by saving them from installing software on their own computer. In contrast with these tools which focus on the execution of programs, and where the users can often interactively chain analyses, GBrowse MOBY (Wilkinson, 2006) and Seahawk (Gordon and Sensen, 2007b) propose data-centric solutions where the user can explore a set of BioMOBY (Wilkinson, 2004) services to analyse a set of given data, with edition, navigation and visualization components which fully exploit the composite nature of BioMOBY objects.",

While including advanced technologies such as web services, remote execution and dataflow mechanisms, it addresses major end-user concerns arising from the use of sophisticated bioinformatics systems. A recent study (Gordon and Sensen, 2007a) shows how simple issues in the user interface can impede the use of a system by scientists, causing them to waste time and even preventing them from using it further. To address this issue, the design of Mobyle's interface is user-centered, to provide a usable yet customizable access to a large panel of services, from genome analysis to structural bioinformatics. The description language it uses to generate user interfaces is sufficiently extensive and flexible for rich user interfaces to be generated. Its core partly relies on concepts previously embedded in PISE and the RPBS portal (Alland et al., 2005). Moreover, different Mobyle servers can be federated to integrate services distributed over various sites. This functionality enables the federation of a network of curated portals, combining the skills of each of them. The Mobyle program description language also enables to define web services, as shown by the PlayMOBY Mobyle companion tool, which automates the publication of BioMOBY web services, and has monitoring capabilities that provide the bases for service quality monitoring.",

Since the Mobyle system can convert the data to the format which is accepted by the next task, there is no need to have service interoperability rely on a bioinformatics format description. For instance, in the Mobyle Pasteur server, the user can align a set of protein sequences using the clustalwmultialign interface, then pipe the clustalw-formatted result to Phylip protdist: although this program only accepts Phylip-formatted multiple alignments, the squizz program, which handles sequence and alignment conversions, will automatically detect and convert the multiple alignment into the accepted format. This approach simplifies the construction of the protocol: the user does not have to specify data transformation tasks, allowing optimal handling of the data (the format conversion information is directly accessible in the job result page). This typing system is configurable and relies on a 'best-effort' approach. Tasks such as format detection or conversion are handled by the system only if they are compatible with the local configuration.",

This feature facilitates user access to services physically distributed over different Mobyle servers, within an integrated environment enabling data reuse and program chaining. As opposed to BioMOBY, Mobyle does not provide any central repository to register new services, relying instead on a distributed registration: each Mobyle server administrator chooses to publish a number of services, which can be upon his choice exported to or imported from remote Mobyle servers. Remote program invocation relies on the import of the remote program XML descriptions. Upon submission, this allows to generate a call to the remote server instead of generating and submitting a local batch call. In such a configuration, the user workspace, as well as the local jobs, remain stored on the initial server, but remotely invoked jobs are directly linked from their execution servers (Fig. 4). We demonstrate the use of this facility for the easy comparative modelling of the structure of a protein identified from analysis of the sunflower genome. A step by step tutorial is available on the MobyleNet help pages (http://mobyle.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/ help/MobyleTutorials_network.html). This task can be broken down into several successive steps: inferring protein sequence from the genomic information, performing a search for a template structure, fitting the query sequence to the template and then generating a 3D model. Protein sequence inference can currently be performed through the LIPM Mobyle server, using the heliagene resource dedicated to sunflower genomic information. The next steps can be achieved through the RPBS Mobyle server using a two pass blast (PDBblast service) to identify candidate template structures from the query sequence. Sequence alignment can be performed through the Institut Pasteur Mobyle server using the clustalw service. Finally, the 3D modelling and model visualization/analysis can be performed through the RPBS site (Fig. 2). The Mobyle network allows efficient organization of the complete sequence of tasks as a pipeline, without having to leave the RPBS Mobyle portal, but making use of the resources and services at the three sites.",

PlayMOBY also integrates a perl library to generate the corresponding Mobyle XML description file from program parameters. Thus, PlayMOBY reduces the overheads of publishing BioMOBY web services. To date, PlayMOBY handles more than 100 BioMOBY web services for providing generic sequence analysis tools and ensuring the interoperability of specialized databases (http://www.legoo.org, http://www.heliagene .org and http://narcisse.toulouse.inra.fr).",

We made the choice to not allow web services users to launch these tests, which are instead automatically launched. The tests consist in verifying accessibility to the web service and consistency and stability of the results on test data. Their results are published as XML reports and RSS feeds. The PlayMOBY description for the QoS presently follows the specifications stated by the BioWorkflow group (Wessner et al., 2008). However, it could easily be extended to other frameworks such as the BioCatalogue project (Belhajjame et al., 2008). In the case of failures or unexpected results, alerts are sent by e-mail to the developers. Thus, PlayMOBY also provides the framework to evaluate Mobyle service reliability and curation. This problem is particularly important in bioinformatics, given the volatility of tools (especially web-based), impairing the reliability of biological data processing.",

These were used to gain a deeper understanding of how a web portal could facilitate the use of bioinformatics tools by biologists. These studies are described in detail elsewhere (Letondal and Amanatian, 2004). The results showed the principal needs of biologists to be: (1) a stable and predictable set of known tools integrated in a portal designed for inexperienced users; (2) an overview of the analyses and careful organization of results; (3) reusability features to re-execute previous commands; and (4) userdefined and ready-to-use analysis pipelines, similar to benchmarked protocols. We also concluded that caution should be taken regarding advanced features. Indeed, (5) biologists are often sceptical about sophisticated tools that are difficult to understand: they have to be able to anticipate the benefits that such tools may provide.",

It runs on top of the Mobyle core library, exploiting the Mobyle network to execute tasks distributed between local and remote servers, and orchestrates the tasks to synchronize their execution with the availability of all their input data. Mobyle workflows modelize a set of tasks, but in contrast with existing workflow languages such as SCUFL in Taverna (Oinn et al., 2004) or MoML in Kepler (Altintas et al., 2004), do not specify explicitly some low-level data format detection and transformation tasks. Authors are, whenever possible according to local configuration, not asked to specify these steps. Hence, the storage of workflow definitions is planned to be based on an extension of the current Mobyle XML language, as they are based on a higher level perspective on the analyses they describe. An interesting outcome is the possibility to save an interactively designed program chaining as a reusable composite service. This perspective provides a gateway towards the publication of useracknowledged protocols on a community-based platform such as myexperiment.org (De Roure et al., 2007). Future end-user access to the workflow definitions and workflow engine will be integrated to the current web interface.",
