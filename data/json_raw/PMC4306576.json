Although pregnancy scares are distressing events, little is known about who experiences them and whether they are important to our understanding of unintended pregnancy. Objective-We describe the young women who experience pregnancy scares, and examine the link between pregnancy scares and subsequent unintended pregnancy. Methods-We used data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life Study. T-tests and regression analyses were conducted using baseline and weekly data to estimate relationships between respondent characteristics and subsequent pregnancy scares. Event history methods were used to assess pregnancy scares as a predictor of unintended pregnancy. Results-Nine percent of the young women experienced a pregnancy scare during the study. African-American race, lack of two-parent family structure, lower GPA, cohabitation, and sex without birth control prior to the study are associated with experiencing a pregnancy scare and with experiencing a greater number of pregnancy scares. Further, experiencing a pregnancy scare is strongly associated with subsequent unintended pregnancy, independent of background factors. Forty percent of the women who experienced a pregnancy scare subsequently had an unintended pregnancy during the study period, relative to only 11% of those who did not experience a pregnancy scare. Conclusions-Young women from less advantaged backgrounds are more likely to experience a pregnancy scare, and pregnancy scares are often followed by an unintended pregnancy.",

For example, as one respondent (who did not desire a pregnancy) told us shortly after her pregnancy scare, \"I thought there could have been a chance that I was pregnant but it turned out that I wasn't, so I am very thankful for that.\" Many respondents reported, \"I missed this month's period,\" or \"My period started seven days late\" to explain why they temporarily thought they were pregnant.",

            "text": "Our second objective is to examine the link between pregnancy scares and subsequent unintended pregnancy. A pregnancy scare may be an indicator that a young woman is at high risk of an unintended pregnancy, for several reasons. First, adjustment to the idea of a possible pregnancy might introduce some ambivalence into a young woman's desire to avoid pregnancy. This can occur after a miscarriage of an unintended pregnancy. As one respondent told us, \"I found out I was pregnant and I miscarried. I didn't know that I wanted a baby until I lost it. That is why part of me wants to get pregnant now. I'm not trying to but I would be happy if I did.\" If pregnancy scares affect pregnancy desire, or ambivalence about pregnancy, in a similar way, then pregnancy scares will have a direct effect on the likelihood of experiencing a later pregnancy. Second, for imperfect contraceptors, a pregnancy scare is likely to precede an actual unintended pregnancy, because the average pregnancy rate for any given month is only about 50% for young women even when sex is perfectly timed to ovulation (Dunson, Colombo, and Baird 2002). Third, personality traits or skills that lead to pregnancy scares may predict unintended pregnancy as well -for example, the ability to consistently adhere to a contraception regimen.",

We analyze the weeks in which the respondent was not pregnant and did not strongly desire a pregnancy. We use two questions from the weekly surveys that measured pregnancy desires to identify those weeks. The first question asked respondents how much they wanted to get pregnant during the next month. The second question asked respondents how much they wanted to avoid getting pregnant during the next month. Both questions used a response scale from 0 to 5. Figure 1 summarizes the combined responses to these two questions, which we describe as strong antinatal, moderate antinatal, ambivalent/indifferent/ moderate pronatal, and strong pronatal. The design of these measures and how they relate to subsequent pregnancy have been described elsewhere (Miller, Barber, and Gatny 2013). In this study we omit weeks classified as strong pronatal in Figure 1. The result is an analytic sample of 901 young women and 34,943 observations.",

Independent samples' t-tests indicate whether the independent variables are statistically different in the two subsamples. Next we investigate these characteristics in a multivariate context, using logistic regression for models of experiencing any pregnancy scare, and Poisson regression for models of the number of pregnancy scares (Table 3). Lastly, we estimate hazard models, implemented using logistic regression, to illustrate the relationship between a pregnancy scare and subsequent unintended pregnancy (Table 4). All analyses were conducted in Stata 12.1 using the logit, poisson, and xtlogit commands. The hazard models were estimated with xtlogit to account for the clustering effect of multiple journals per respondent. Table 2 shows that, overall, sociodemographic characteristics associated with disadvantage are overrepresented in the subsample of young women who experienced a pregnancy scare. For example, while only 32% of those who did not experience a pregnancy scare are African American, 54% of those who experienced a pregnancy scare are African American. Also, young women with early pregnancy-related experiences are overrepresented in the pregnancy scares subsample.",

In addition, young women with two or more sexual partners experienced a marginally higher number of pregnancy scares than their peers. This suggests that women who had multiple sexual partners are disproportionately represented in the group that experienced multiple pregnancy scares. In these multivariate regression models, having had sex without birth control is the only adolescent pregnancy-related experience strongly related to pregnancy scares. Recall that in the bivariate models, on the other hand, early sex, multiple partners, prior sex without birth control, and one or more prior pregnancies are strongly related to pregnancy scares. This suggests that early sex, multiple sexual partners, and prior pregnancy are associated with pregnancy scares largely because of the sociodemographic characteristics of those young women who have early sex, multiple partners, and teen pregnancies, or because of their association with having sex without birth control. This is consistent with existing research; for example, finding that early sexual debut is associated with less contraceptive use (Kusunoki and Upchurch 2011;Manning, Longmore, and Giordano 2000;Manlove, Ryan, and Franzetta 2007). Note also that respondents who completed more journals were more likely to report a pregnancy scare, likely in part because it is associated with more time in the study period.",

In addition, the time variables are significant -the risk of unintended pregnancy increases throughout most of the study period, but then declines slightly near the end (indicated by the small negative coefficient for the variable indicating squared months in the study). Respondents who completed more journals during the study also had a lower hazard of unintended pregnancy. Note that because total number of journals completed is net of time in the study in these models, the negative coefficient likely represents the type of respondent who completed many journals within a specific period. Thus, the negative association is due to characteristics that lead respondents to complete more journals and also reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy, for example, conscientiousness.",

However, the fact that the magnitude of the pregnancy scare effect declines by 20% between models 2 and 3 indicates that pregnancy scares are associated with unintended pregnancy in part because of the sociodemographic characteristics linked to both experiences.",

A wide range of sociodemographic characteristics and adolescent experiences were associated with pregnancy scares in our bivariate analyses. However, in our multivariate analyses, only being African-American, growing up with something other than a two-parent family structure, having a lower high school GPA, living with a romantic partner, and having sex without birth control during adolescence were independently associated with a higher probability of a pregnancy scare. We found similar results when we predicted number of pregnancy scares. This suggests that although pregnancy scares occur to all types of young women, those from less advantaged backgrounds are more likely to experience a pregnancy scare than those from more advantaged backgrounds.",

In our hazard models, pregnancy scares are a strong predictor of unintended pregnancy, independent of key sociodemographic characteristics and adolescent experiences. In other words, young women who experience a pregnancy scare have higher unintended pregnancy rates than those who do not, regardless of their background. This suggests that pregnancy scares may be a harbinger of a future unintended pregnancy.",

The very few Latinas in the county, and in our sample, precludes assessing them as a separate category.
