            "text": "Maxillary sinus floor augmentation has been shown to be the most predictable surgical technique for enhancing the bone volume in the posterior area of the maxilla. The purpose of this study was to analyze the serial slice image segmentation of newly formed bone and bone substitutes after sinus floor elevation using synchrotron radiation X-ray micro-computed tomography (SR-\u00b5CT). Materials and methods: Bone biopsy specimens were collected after 6 months of sinus floor augmentation. From the six bone biopsy specimens, the cross-sectional images at every 8 \u00b5m along the apical direction from the inferior border using serial segmentation from threedimensional reconstructed X-ray images were analyzed. The amount of new bone and bone substitutes were measured at each slicing image (300-430 images per specimen). Results: The bone dynamics between the new bone and bone substitutes along the inferiorsuperior direction in humans after maxillary sinus floor elevation (MSFE) were analyzed using the whole sample region. Although these observations suggest that the specimens are structurally inhomogeneous, sinus floor elevation was confirmed to be a reliable surgical procedure for increasing the amount of bone. Conclusion: SR-\u00b5CT is highly effective for obtaining high-resolution images. An analysis of biological specimens using SR-\u00b5CT is quite reliable and this technique will be an important tool in the wide field of tissue engineering.",

            "text": "Sinus floor elevation for dental implant placement in the posterior maxilla with deficient bone height is a well-known procedure for bone grafting. [1][2][3][4][5] Previous studies have reported successful outcomes with bone substitutes (BSs) in sinus floor elevation procedures. 2,6 Of the various BSs available, xenogeneic BSs (Bio-Oss \u00ae ) are used widely and consist of the mineral phase of bovine bone, inorganic and a natural hydroxyapatite-containing ultrastructure. 7 The quantitative determination of new bone (NB) is one of the key factors for judging the efficacy of various bone grafting materials for maxillary sinus floor elevation in humans. To observe and estimate the amount of NB after a surgical treatment, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) photomicrography is one of the most widely used techniques in histology, because the conventional dye-stained photomicrographs are exceptionally good for highlighting biological structures, including bulk tissues and bones. In general, histologic techniques based on cutting and grinding are used to assess the ability of NB formation using BSs. Conventional histomorphometry using H&E photomicrography, which uses samples obtained by a trephine bur, provides the information for bone dynamics along the coronal-apical direction from the longitudinal sectional view along the direction of the sagittal plane. On the other hand, a very limited number of sections are analyzed in conventional histomorphometry due to the complex physical process of slicing the bone samples and the time consuming and high cost of sample preparation.",

Although \u00b5CT provides many of the above-mentioned merits, it has some limitations for achieving high-resolution images using a desktop X-ray lab source due to polychromatic radiation and the low X-ray flux of X-ray sources. In addition, the wide use of \u00b5CT has been limited by the difficulty of volumetric analysis, serial segmentation, and handling of giga-byte data for post-processing. For those reasons, previous research focused on comparing \u00b5CT with conventional methods regarding the bone mineral density of iliac crest, vertebrae, femur, [9][10][11] and trabecular pattern in an animal model.",

Recently, 3D observations of the tissue sample can be possible using \u00b5CT. [19][20][21] This paper presented an approach to evaluate human bone biopsy specimens by high-flux SR-\u00b5CT. Using SR-\u00b5CT, the bone dynamics of human bone were observed directly along the inferior-superior direction after 6 months of MSFE and 6 months after the sinus floor elevation, it was confirmed that bone augmentation in maxillary sinus had been performed successfully. Each specimen had different amounts of Bio-Oss \u00ae remaining and different NB:BS ratios after 6 months of MSFE. The entire graft was not as homogeneous, even in the individual specimens. On the other hand, the ratio of NB was much higher in the positions where the BSs had been applied than one in the untreated regions. This suggests that the region with BSs can be changed to the NB region, even though the speed of the transition differs according to the position and status of the patients. From this observation, the MSFE technique is quite reliable for the placement of dental implants in deficient bone areas of the posterior region of the maxilla.",

First, the observation region was limited to 3 mm along the upper direction, which is not a sufficient length scale to observe the difference between the upper and lower parts. This can be overcome by extending the observation region to 15 mm in the next experimental design. Second, the maturation period, 6 months recovery time, was too long to observe the early behavior of the BSs. To exclude this situation, different maturation periods can be applied to observe the early stages of bone regeneration. In addition, compaction of bone during the process using a trephine bur can occur easily due to differences in the bone density between the sponge bone and the compact bone. This would make it difficult to observe the difference between the upper and lower parts. Therefore, more study will be needed to determine the correlation with the position along the upper direction.",

The continuous bone regeneration pattern including the ratio and distribution of NB and BSs were measured every 8 \u00b5m from each specimen. In this study, the maxillary sinus floor elevation was confirmed to be a reliable surgical procedure that aims to increase the amount of bone. The use of SR-\u00b5CT is quite effective for obtaining high-resolution images due to the phase-contrast effect of synchrotron radiation. Highthroughput analysis of maxillary sinus floor elevation can be performed with high accuracy without the 3-week complex sample preparation procedure. An analysis of biological specimens using SR-\u00b5CT is quite reliable, and this technique would be a very important tool in the wide field of tissue engineering.",
