In this study a dust collection system was developed to capture the airborne dust in the rice mill. The feeding and sieving section of the mill was identified as major dust creating zone. The dust was captured by creating suitable air stream at feeding and sieving sections of the mill and collected in cyclone dust collector. The air stream was created by blower which was selected on the basis to get minimum air speed of 0.5 m/s in the working zones of workers. It was observed that the developed system is successfully collects the significant amount of dust and able to reduce the dust concentration up to 58%. Further, the respirable dust concentration reduced to below 5 mg/m 3 throughout the mill which is within the recommended limit of dust exposure.",

Rice production in India crossed the mark of 100 million Metric tons in 2011 -12 accounting for 22.81% of global production in that year 1) . The post-harvest processing of paddy (de-husking) is the oldest and the largest agro processing industry of the country. It is a basic process that can be found in local towns and villages across the country. Assam has been ranked 1 st in rice production (51 lakh metric ton) with productivity of 1,969 kg per hectare 2) . Approximately, Assam consists of 5,560 rice mills which include 1,363 modern and remaining traditional mills 3) . In traditional rice mill, at a time minimum 4 -5 workers are required to monitor and control all the operations. Therefore, a large number of workers are employed in the rice milling industry in Assam, India.",

It is revealed that there is significant reduction in total dust concentration 55 to 59 percent. The total dust concentration after modification at feeding-cumsieving section varied from 31 -34 mg/m 3 compared to that of 73 -80 mg/m 3 before modification. The respirable dust is reduced to the lower than recommended limit of 5 mg/m 3 at all the sections. The developed system is very much feasible and cost effective for traditional rice mills of Assam. From the subjective analysis it was also observed that workers' working hour enhanced by 18 -20% with the adaptation of dust reduction system which interns as financial benefits. All the previous trial for dust separation was to enhance the quality of final rice product not to reduce the air borne dust. This system is typically for reducing the air borne dust which was affecting the worker health. This technology can also be used in other similar industry.",
