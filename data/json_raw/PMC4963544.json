In this study a dust collection system was developed to capture the airborne dust in the rice mill. The feeding and sieving section of the mill was identified as major dust creating zone. The dust was captured by creating suitable air stream at feeding and sieving sections of the mill and collected in cyclone dust collector. The air stream was created by blower which was selected on the basis to get minimum air speed of 0.5 m/s in the working zones of workers. It was observed that the developed system is successfully collects the significant amount of dust and able to reduce the dust concentration up to 58%. Further, the respirable dust concentration reduced to below 5 mg/m 3 throughout the mill which is within the recommended limit of dust exposure.",

Rice production in India crossed the mark of 100 million Metric tons in 2011 -12 accounting for 22.81% of global production in that year 1) . The post-harvest processing of paddy (de-husking) is the oldest and the largest agro processing industry of the country. It is a basic process that can be found in local towns and villages across the country. Assam has been ranked 1 st in rice production (51 lakh metric ton) with productivity of 1,969 kg per hectare 2) . Approximately, Assam consists of 5,560 rice mills which include 1,363 modern and remaining traditional mills 3) . In traditional rice mill, at a time minimum 4 -5 workers are required to monitor and control all the operations. Therefore, a large number of workers are employed in the rice milling industry in Assam, India.",

The major dust hazards for workers in rice mills are the dust emissions from different sections i.e. dumping of rice at a place for subsequent collection in gunny bags, feed of paddy from gunny bags to the dumping pit, cleaning of paddy grains, removal of husk from the paddy and polishing of rice. In addition, a dusty mill increases the risk of workers' injury and fire hazard, which results in less production, higher insurance rates, and lawsuits. The increasing global attention on control of air pollution has made the containment of nuisance dust from rice milling operations within enclosures more imperative.",

The contour of 0.5 m/s speed is indicated by bold line in Fig. 7 which is fully dust free zone. Further, at 0.3 m above and below the line of opening, 0.5 m/s air speed was observed up to 0.4 m only (Fig. 8). The air speed of 0.5 m/s is referred to discuss because this is the minimum required velocity to blow the airborne dust of less than 10 \u00b5m as per the WHO 13) . The working area of worker in feeding zone was witnessed 1 m \u00d7 1 m but it was observed that most of the time, workers work within 0.7 m \u00d7 0.7 m area where measured air speed was more than 0.5 m/s. Velocity profile at sieving section The air velocity created by blower above the sieve was also measured at sieving section. The contour of air velocity is shown in Fig. 9. The straight continuous lines indicate the boundary of the sieve. From the figure, it is clear that air velocity is more than 0.65 m/s above the sieve. Further, the air velocity was more than 0.5 m/s outside the sieve up to 20 cm in three sides which is working zone of the workers.",

From the subjective analysis it was also observed that workers' working hour enhanced by 18 -20% with the adaptation of dust reduction system which interns as financial benefits. All the previous trial for dust separation was to enhance the quality of final rice product not to reduce the air borne dust. This system is typically for reducing the air borne dust which was affecting the worker health. This technology can also be used in other similar industry.",
