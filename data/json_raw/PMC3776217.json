The molecules have dendritic architecture and contain multiple copies of zinc(II)-dipicolylamine (ZnDPA) units that have selective affinity for the bacterial cell envelope. A series of molecular structures were evaluated, with the number of appended ZnDPA units ranging from four to thirty-two. Agglutination assays showed that the multivalent probes rapidly cross-linked ten different strains of bacteria, regardless of Gram-type and cell morphology. Fluorescence microscopy studies using probes with four ZnDPA units indicated a high selectivity for bacteria agglutination in the presence of mammalian cells and no measurable effect on the health of the cells. The high bacterial selectivity was confirmed by conducting in vivo optical imaging studies of a mouse leg infection model. The results suggest that multivalent ZnDPA molecular probes with dendritic structures have great promise as selective, broad spectrum bacterial agglutination agents for infection imaging and theranostic applications.",

            "text": "Increased awareness of microbial resistance to clinical antibiotics is motivating researchers to explore novel ways of detecting and treating bacterial infections [1][2][3][4][5]. As an alternative to small molecule pharmaceuticals, various therapeutic antibody strategies have been investigated to either directly target the bacterial cells at a site of infection, or alternatively neutralize the toxins released by the bacteria [6][7][8]. The exquisite targeting ability of antibodies makes them attractive as potential antibiotics. However, despite intensive efforts, the first antibacterial antibody has only just been approved in the US by the FDA [9]. As therapeutics, antibodies have several potential pharmaceutical drawbacks such as susceptibility to degradation by protease action and poor diffusion into tissues sites with size restrictions. In order to address these challenges, there is ongoing research effort to engineer antibodies or antibody fragments with enhanced stability and smaller sizes [10,11].",

            "text": "International Publisher structural approaches have employed cationic dendrimers to target and disrupt bacterial membranes, or appended peptides or drugs to the dendrimers to create antibiotics with improved pharmacokinetic properties [21]. In most of these cases, the bacterial cell surface target is a protein or a specific structural component of the bacterial cell wall, and thus the probe targeting is not necessarily universal to all genera of bacteria. Our own efforts to target bacterial cell surfaces has focused on synthetic zinc(II)-dipicolylamine (ZnDPA) coordination complexes, such as bZnDPA and mZnDPA (Figure 1), that have affinity for the phosphorylated amphiphiles that are ubiquitous within the bacterial envelope [22,23]. To date, our work has produced a portfolio of fluorescently labeled bZnDPA probe molecules that act as in vitro and in vivo optical imaging agents for bacteria [24][25][26][27][28][29][30]. One example, that is the starting point for this present study, is the molecular probe Bis-SR-bZnDPA (Chart 1/ Figure A)  [30]. The molecule has two bZnDPA units appended to a central squaraine rotaxane scaffold that is intensely fluorescent with deep-red absorption/emission wavelengths that are well suited for in vitro and in vivo optical imaging. We have reported previously that Bis-SR-bZnDPA is an effective bacterial imaging agent and enables in vivo fluorescence imaging of bacterial infection in a mouse model [30]. Here, we describe bacterial targeting studies using the multivalent probe molecules in Chart 1/Figure A that have more than two appended ZnDPA units [31]. The project goal was to determine if molecular probes with multiple ZnDPA units would exhibit selective targeting of bacterial cells in the presence of mammalian cells. We find that multivalent ZnDPA probes are potent agglutination agents for virtually all strains of bacteria. Microscopy studies using the fluorescent probe, Tetra-SR-bZnDPA, with four bZnDPA units, demonstrated that bacteria targeting in the presence of healthy mammalian cells is quite selective. The high bacterial selectivity was confirmed by conducting in vivo imaging studies of a mouse leg infection model. Our results suggest that multivalent ZnDPA probes with dendritic structures have great promise as broad spectrum bacterial agglutination agents for potential application in bacterial imaging, diagnostics, and antibiotic therapy.

            "text": "Brightfield microscopy was used to rapidly screen the probe molecules in Chart 1/Figure A for bacteria agglutination ability. Appropriate aliquots of the ten separate cultures of bacteria in HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, were placed on microscopy slides and treated separately with the four different Tetra-ZnDPA probes (10 \u03bcM). The typical imaging results in Figure  2 illustrate a general trend that the two bZnDPA derived probes, Tetra-SR-bZnDPA and Tetra-bZnDPA, caused all strains of bacteria to agglutinate, whereas the two mZnDPA probes, Tetra-SR-mZnDPA and Tetra-mZnDPA, were only partially effective (see Supplementary Material: Figure S1 for micrographs of the complete series). The importance of the multiple ZnDPA units for agglutination effect is highlighted by the images in Fig. 2E and 2F which show, respectively, extensive agglutination induced by PAMAM-G4-bZnDPA, a multivalent dendrimer with ~32 ZnDPA units per molecule, and no agglutination induced by the cationic, PAMAM-G4 polyamine dendrimer. No agglutination was the observed outcome when the apo-DPA forms of the probes (lacking Zn 2+ ) were tested indicating that the Zn 2+ ions are a necessary probe component. Another set of control experiments demonstrated that the presence of bovine serum albumin (50 mg/mL) did not inhibit the bacterial cell agglutination process. A more quantitative assessment of relative agglutination potency for each probe molecule was gained by conducting Slide Agglutination Assays, all on the same day and under the same conditions [32][33][34][35][36][37]. Appropriate aliquots of the ten bacterial cul-tures in HEPES buffer were placed on separate microscopy slides and then treated with separate aliquots of the four Tetra-DPA probes (10 \u03bcM). This process produced forty different probe/bacteria mixtures that were imaged using brightfield microscopy. For reach mixture, the area of each bacterial cluster within five randomly chosen image fields was measured digitally and an average cluster area was calculated. With each strain of bacteria, the average cluster size induced by each of the four probes was normalized relative to the largest average cluster size. The data in Table 1 lists the relative order of probe agglutination ability for each strain of bacteria. The data shows that Tetra-SR-bZnDPA was usually the most potent agglutination agent. The bactericidal activity of one agglutination agent (Tetra-bZnDPA) was assessed using Ethidium Bromide III (EtD III), a red fluorescent nucleic acid dye that only stains dead bacteria with damaged cell membranes. The EtD III was incubated with E. coli K12, E. coli UTI89 and S. aureus NRS11 in the presence and absence of Tetra-bZnDPA (10 \u00b5M). Fluorescence microscopy showed that each bacterial population contained about 15% of dead cells that were stained with EtD III. This was corroborated by plating experiments that incubated the cross-linked bacteria overnight on LB agar plates at 37\u00b0C. With each bacterial strain, a sample that was cross-linked with Tetra-bZnDPA exhibited similar growth and colony formation as an equivalent amount of untreated bacteria, indicating no significant bactericidal activity. These results indicate that crosslinking of the bacteria with a multivalent bZnDPA probe does not affect bacteria viability, a conclusion that matches with our previous observations that molecular probes with the same type of bZnDPA affinity units have low antibiotic activity [26].",

One hour incubations at 37\u00b0 C of the probe with cultures of healthy mammalian cells (A549, HeLa, or V79) showed no evidence of probe entry into the cells (data not shown). Additional studies employed Calcein AM, a green-emitting dye that measures cell vitality. After cell entry and subsequent hydrolysis, the dye remains trapped in the cytosol as long as the cell is viable. The micrographs in Figures 6 and Supplementary Material: Figure S6 show HeLa cells after they were incubated with Tetra-SR-bZnDPA (10 \u00b5M) for 15 minutes and then treated with Calcein AM (1 \u00b5g/mL) and bacterial E. coli K12 cells. The intense and steady green fluorescence inside the HeLa cells indicated that they remained healthy, while the bacterial cells were cross-linked by the red-emitting Tetra-SR-bZnDPA. The lack of cell toxicity is consistent with a previous report that studied the interaction of multivalent ZnDPA nanoparticles with mammalian cells [38].    ",

Indeed, we have already reported that Bis-SR-bZnDPA probe enables in vivo fluorescence imaging of bacterial infection in mice [30]. In this present study, a leg infection imaging study was designed to compare the biodistribution of tetravalent Tetra-SR-bZnDPA (a potent bacterial agglutination agent) with divalent Bis-SR-bZnDPA (does not induce bacterial agglutination). Two cohorts of hairless mice (each N=3) were infected with S. aureus Xen29 in the left leg. After three hours, the mice were injected with 10 nmol of either Bis-SR-bZnDPA or Tetra-SR-bZnDPA and imaged at regular intervals over a period of 48 hours (Figure 7, a quantitative analysis of the in vivo images is provided in Supplementary Material: Figure S7). Bis-SR-bZnDPA exhibited similar imaging performance as previously reported. The amount of probe signal in the infected leg reached a peak by 6 hours (T/NT ~ 7.2) and was nearly eliminated after 24 hours. The Tetra-SR-bZnDPA showed a similar high degree of selective targeting to the infected leg (T/NT ~ 8.3), with maximum accumulation by 6 hours. However, probe washout was significantly slower and at 48 hours post probe injection, measurable fluorescence signal re-mained in the infected leg of the living animal. The mice were then sacrificed and imaging analysis of the excised organs confirmed that there was more Tetra-SR-bZnDPA than Bis-SR-bZnDPA in the infected leg (Figure 8). Another notable difference in the ex vivo biodistribution data is a significantly higher amount of Tetra-SR-bZnDPA in the lungs. The reason(s) for this are not exactly clear, however, one possibility is that crosslinking induced by the Tetra-SR-bZnDPA leads to aggregates in the blood stream that are trapped by the lung capillaries.

The cell discrimination is remarkably high, with fluorescence microscopy evidence for selective bacterial agglutination in the presence of healthy mammalian cells and no apparent impact on the health of the mammalian cells. The high bacterial cell selectivity ZnDPA probes agrees with previous reports from our group [24,25,[27][28][29][30], and others [39], and is also consistent with our independent work to develop these probes as selective imaging agents for the anionic surfaces of dead and dying mammalian cells [40]. Control studies demonstrated that the zinc cations are necessary recognition components since apo-versions of the molecular probes (lacking Zn 2+ ) did not induce agglutination. Agglutination effectiveness increased with a higher number of ZnDPA units attached to the central organic scaffold (i.e., faster formation of bacterial aggregates and increased mechanical stability of the aggregates). Comparative experiments showed that bZnDPA probes were more effective than mZnDPA probes as agglutination agents. This agrees with previous observations that bZnDPA units have higher affinity for anionic phospholipid headgroups than mZnDPA units due to enhanced electrostatic attraction and stronger bidentate coordination bonds [41].",

Both were effective as bacteria-seeking probes. Clearance of the Tetra-SR-bZnDPA probe from the site of infection was slower, an observation that is consistent with in vivo agglutination. Conceptually, the broad spectrum targeting of the multivalent ZnDPA probes is complementary to the specific targeting of antibodies. Antibodies have additional attributes that promote cell killing and recruitment of the host immune response. The multivalent ZnDPA probes reported here are not directly bactericidal but they may nonetheless have therapeutic value as bacteria immobilization agents or be useful as theranostic agents. Fig 8.
