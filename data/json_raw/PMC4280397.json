We aimed to evaluate correlation and agreement of tumor size measurements using CESM. As additional analysis, we evaluated whether measurements using an additional breast MRI exam would yield more accurate results. Methods-Between January 1 st 2013 and April 1 st 2014, 87 consecutive breast cancer cases that underwent CESM were collected and data on maximum tumor size measurements were gathered. In 57 cases, tumor size measurements were also available for breast MRI. Histopathological results of the surgical specimen served as gold standard in all cases. Results-The Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCC) of CESM versus histopathology and breast MRI versus histopathology were all >0.9, p<0.0001. For the agreement between measurements, the mean difference between CESM and histopathology was 0.03 mm. The mean difference between breast MRI and histopathology was 2.12 mm. Using a 2x2 contingency table to assess the frequency distribution of a relevant size discrepancy of >1 cm between the two imaging modalities and histopathological results, we did not observe any advantage of performing an additional breast MRI after CESM in any of the cases. Conclusion-Quality of tumor size measurement using CESM is good and matches the quality of these measurement assessed by breast MRI. Additional measurements using breast MRI did not improve the quality of tumor size measurements.",

Breast MRI is superior to all other imaging modalities for preoperative evaluation of breast cancer extent, since it assesses tumor diameter most accurately [4][5][6]. However, since breast MRI and CESM are based on similar principles, CESM might show a similar performance. Previously, only one study reported on the quality of tumor diameter measurements using both CESM and breast MRI [7]. In this paper the correlation of both measurements (with histopathological analysis as the gold standard) was presented. Studying the reproducibility of these results and more importantly the agreement between these two measurements provides additional information on the quality of these measurements [8].",

The CESM imaging protocol has been described elsewhere in detail [9]. In short, a non-ionic monomeric low-osmolar contrast agent (iopromide; Ultravist \u00ae 300, Bayer Healthcare, Germany) is administered intravenously, after which CESM acquires a set of low and high energy images in quick succession. As a result, an image similar to a conventional mammogram (i.e. the low-energy CESM image) [2] and an image containing information on enhancement of structures can be reviewed (i.e. the recombined CESM image) ( Figure 1). All CESM exams performed between January 1 st 2013 and April 1 st 2014 were included in this retrospective study. Out of this database, all consecutive breast cancer cases were collected, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Since both low energy and recombined images are an integral part of the exam, maximum tumor diameter measurement is performed on the entire CESM exam (i.e. viewing both the low and recombined images together in both projection views) using calipers and a dedicated mammography workstation (IDI MammoWorkstation, GE Healthcare, United Kingdom). Core biopsies were performed immediately after the CESM exam.",

All breast MRI exams were performed on a single 1.5 Tesla scanner (Intera, Philips Healthcare, the Netherlands) using a dedicated 16-channel breast coil. The protocol consisted of a transverse T2w sequence and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), combined with a dynamic, contrast-enhanced T1w sequence in the transverse plane (consisting of 1.0 mm isotropic voxels and a temporal resolution of 93 seconds). Blinded for CESM measurements, tumor diameter measurements were performed on the first dynamic scan after contrast administration, i.e. at peak en-hancement of the tumor, using calipers and a dedicated workstation (Dynacad, Invivo International, the Netherlands). We recorded the presence of hematomas or other post-biopsy effects seen on breast MRI which might influence the accuracy of tumor size measurements.",

In this study by Fallenberg et al., the PCC for CESM and histopathology was 0.733 (p<0.0001), and 0.654 (p<0.0001) for breast MRI and histopathology. In our study, PCC's were 0.905 (p<0.0001) and 0.915 (p<0.0001) respectively. However, merely calculating the PCC can be misleading, since good correlation does not automatically imply good agreement between measurements of two different modalities [8,11]. If there is a systematic over-or underestimation in the two measurements, PCC can be high, while agreement can be poor. For these comparisons, a Bland-Altman plot might be a more suitable method of presenting the results, since it allows us to evaluate the range and magnitude of measurement errors and shows whether these errors are acceptable in terms of clinical consequences [11]. As our Bland-Altman plots show, breast MRI shows a small tendency to overestimate tumor size (mean difference +2 mm), whereas CESM does not. However, the 95% LOA of breast MRI are smaller than CESM. These plots also show that the observed mean differences are in our opinion clinically neglible.",

A relevant size discrepancy was defined as >1 cm between CESM tumor size measurements and the final histopathological tumor size measurement. This approach allowed us to study in the 58 lesions that were measured by both CESM and breast MRI if an additional breast MRI after a CESM exam would results in more accurate tumor size estimations. In the majority of cases, no relevant size discrepancies were observed in both modalities. In three cases, CESM already assessed tumor size accurately, whereas an additional breast MRI exam would result in a larger overestimation of tumor size, resulting in unnecessary excision of healthy breast tissue. In three cases, both CESM and breast MRI underestimated breast cancer size, but this did not result in tumor-positive surgical margins. Only one case of a 13 mm tumor showed a potential benefit of the addition of breast MRI, but this was mainly caused by our predefined cut off value for size discrepancy of 1 cm. In short, this 2x2 contingency table did not show any benefit of additionally performing a breast MRI exam after CESM in any of the cases.",

First, the sample size of the population is small, which refrained us from studying the ability of CESM to detect multifocal breast cancer in comparison to breast MRI. In a paper by Jochelson et al., CESM was compared to breast MRI with respect to cancer detection rates and false-positive findings, but also for the evaluation of multifocal breast cancer. In this study of 52 cancer cases, 88% of the additional ipsilateral breast cancers were detected by breast MRI, versus 56% detected by CESM [16]. Consequently, breast MRI might be more accurate than CESM in detecting multifocal breast cancers. We could not perform any additional analysis on the ability of CESM to detect multifocal breast cancer ourselves due to the limited number of cases (n=4). As a result, there is currently insufficient evidence that CESM can also be reliably used in multifocal breast cancers, and as such additional breast MRI should be considered if multifocal breast cancer is suspected.",

For example, tumor diameter may be distorted during the process of removal and fixation of the surgical specimen [17][18][19][20]. Due to the pliable nature of the breast, tumor diameter may vary depending on patient positioning during imaging exams [19]. In addition, orientation of intact specimens so that tumor diameters are measured in the similar planes in histologic analysis as in imaging might be challenging [17]. These potential errors in measurements are particularly important in retrospective analyses like our current study, since histopathological tumor size measurements were not performed for the purpose of this study.",
