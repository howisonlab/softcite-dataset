            "text": "Objective: In vivo studies of epilepsy typically use prolonged status epilepticus to generate recurrent seizures. However, reports on variable status duration have found discrete differences in injury after 40-50 min of seizures, suggesting a pathophysiologic sensitivity to seizure duration. In this report we take a multivariate cluster analysis to study a short duration status epilepticus model using in vivo 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and histologic evaluation. Methods: The Hellier Dudek model was applied with 45 min of status epilepticus after which the animals were imaged twice, at 3 days and 3 weeks post-status epilepticus. Single voxel point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) MRS was used to acquire data from the dentate gyrus and CA3 region of the hippocampus, assessing metabolite ratios to total creatine (tCr). In a subset of animals after the second imaging study, brains were analyzed histologically by Nissl staining. Results: A hierarchical cluster analysis performed on the 3-day data from 21 kainatetreated animals (dentate gyrus voxel) segregated into two clusters, denoted by KM (more injured, n = 6) and KL (less injured, n = 15). Although there was no difference in kainate dosing or seizure count between them, the metabolic pattern of injury was different. The KM group displayed the largest significant changes in neuronal and glial parameters; the KL group displayed milder but significant changes. At 3 weeks, the KL group returned to normal compared to controls, whereas the KM group persisted with depressed N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/tCr, glutamate/tCr, and increased inositol/tCr and glutamine/tCr. The classification was also consistent with subsequent histologic patterns at 3 weeks. Significance: Although a short status period might be expected to generate a continuous distribution of metabolic injury, these data show that the short Hellier Dudek model appears to generate two levels of injury. The changes seen in segregated groups persisted into 3 weeks, and can be interpreted according to neuronal and glial biomarkers consistent with histology results.",

Using an electrical dentate gyrus stimulation protocol, Norwood 2010 2 reported a similar 40-50 min delay with hilar Fluoro-Jade B staining. It is unclear whether such nonlinear behavior relates to human epidemiologic data (e.g., does the duration of status in febrile seizures influence the probability of development of epilepsy?). 3,4 However, these experimentally observed delays have raised the notion that in rat models, different physiologic or pathophysiologic processes are provoked with progressively longer periods of status epilepticus.",

            "text": "In this report we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with a multivariate analysis approach to evaluate the metabolic changes in the setting of variable injury. This metabolomics approach uses the numerous measurements commonly available from MRS without bias to identify the programmatic changes that may be provoked by the seizures. Given that earlier studies have found substantial metabolic changes during the acute postseizure and epileptogenesis period, 5,6 this approach may show coherent changes between the metabolites that reflect their known roles in neuronal and glial compartments. N-Acetyl aspartate (NAA) has been closely identified with neuronal mitochondrial function, 7 whereas glutamate is the dominant excitatory neurotransmitter and intermediate in the generation of ATP within the neuronal-glial metabolic cycle. 8,9 Although there is extensive contact between the neurotransmitter and metabolic pools of glutamate, 10 the amount of extracellular neurotransmitter glutamate is small (<3 lM 11 ), and thus the large majority arises from intracellular pools of glutamate. c-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), which provides important inhibitory balance to neurotransmitter glutamate (Glu), has a comparatively smaller direct role in energy metabolism than glutamate 12 and is found primarily in GABAergic neurons. For the glial biomarkers, increased myo-inositol (Ins/tCr) and glutamine (Gln/tCr) have been linked with reactive astrocytic activation consistent with the known postseizure changes in osmolarity and increased glutamate clearance. 5,13,14 In several of these studies and as discussed by Connett, 15 metabolite ratios taken relative to total creatine (tCr) provide an informative assessment of metabolites that interact with ATP and are supported by the creatine kinase system. These measurements are thus considered not as absolute concentrations but rather as an index of its function that needs to be compared to control.",

In this study, we take the Hellier Dudek approach applied with a short status epilepticus period of 45 min. With this time frame, we are very close to the apparent pivot point found by Motte 1998 and Norwood 2010. Furthermore, given the known variation due to the bioavailability of intraperitoneal kainate injections (e.g., resulting from differences in local kainate absorption and brain penetration), we hypothesize that a 45-min Hellier Dudek model will generate a spectrum of injury. This report describes results from in 21 kainatetreated rats, at 3 days and 3 weeks post-status epilepticus and 10 control rats. In a subgroup of animals, we obtained histology with Nissl staining after the 3-week time point to provide histologic context for the metabolic measurements.",

At the time of injection, rats weighed 212.8 AE 10.0 g (mean and standard deviation). Animals were injected intraperitoneally and hourly with 5 mg/kg kainate prepared in sterile saline until a stage 3/4/5 seizure (Racine 1972 18 ) was elicited.

Figure 3 shows the total doses of kainate. Control rats were treated equivalently with sterile saline. Seizures were terminated with subcutaneous 20 mg/kg diazepam, which eliminated all behavioral seizures and resulted in apparent sedation. Rats were then given 5 ml warmed subcutaneous Lactated Ringer's solution and returned to their home cage. After SE, rats were weighed daily and given 5 ml warmed Lactated Ringer's and moistened rat chow to facilitate recovery.

This was performed by transcardial perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 followed by 4% buffered paraformaldehyde. After overnight postfixation, brains were cut on a Vibratome into 50lm-thick serial sections and stored in a cryoprotectant solution until staining. At 300-lm intervals through the dorsal hippocampus, sections were stained with cresyl violet, which stains the Nissl substance in all neurons and the DNA of all nuclei including glia. Stained sections were evaluated with bright-field microscopy using a subjective semiquantitative ordinal scale to indicate the degree of neuronal loss in the separate subregions of the dorsal hippocampus relative to controls. Although the analysis of the semiquantitative histologic was performed with knowledge of the total animal group proportions, specific samples were blinded. Figure 1A,B show the positions of the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 voxels, and the performance of the LCM analysis for a 3-day animal. As a group at 3 days, all 45-min rats showed significantly decreased NAA/tCr, increased Ins/tCr, Gln/tCr and Lac/tCr in comparison to control (Fig. 3). These changes are consistent with the occurrence of seizures, with evidence for neuronal mitochondrial injury (decreased NAA/tCr), glial activation with osmotic changes and glutamine synthetase activation (Ins/tCr, Gln/tCr respectively), and glycolytic energy production (Lac/tCr) commonly seen in seizures and post-status. However, as anticipated, there was variability with the kainate-treated animals, seen from the 3-day and 3-week spectra (see Fig. 1C,D). Because data from the CA3 locus did not substantially change these results, these data are available in Supporting Information.",

It is possible that T2 relaxation changes could contribute to this observation; however, use of a short 10-msec TE sharply limits such effects. Thus the alternative needs to be considered, that is, that the observed Glu/tCr increase in KL is a response to excitatory injury, supporting increased resistance to ictogenic insult. 21 There is evidence for this, such as excitatory synapse redistribution, 22 increased gene expression for inflammation, oxidative stress, and calcium signaling. 23 Furthermore, given that glutamate is an intermediate in energy generation, increased pool size for energy production could result in increased glutamate content and thus be a potentially \"healthy\" response to a (presumptively mild) seizure insult. Three weeks later both Glu/tCr and NAA/tCr normalize, this being consistent with the overall healthier KL group, and its fewer histologic abnormalities. In contrast, the KM group's decrease in NAA/tCr is three-fold higher than the drop in Glu/tCr and may reflect permanent injury, consistent with its histology and the persistently low NAA/tCr (\u00c020.9% compared with control) at 3 weeks.",

From the KM group, our observations of sizable increases in Gln/tCr (36.5%, approximately twofold larger than the KL group at 19.1%) is consistent  with results of Van der Hel 24 and may be due partially to conversion of excitatory glutamate (which decreased by 8.6%) into glutamine, given that the normal Glu-Gln neurotransmission cycling is most likely not occurring in the injured KM group. 25 This dysfunctional cycling is likely to also contribute to observations from human temporal lobe epilepsy cases showing normal levels of extracellular glutamine even in the face of decreased glutamine synthetase and known gliosis. 26,27 Caveats The major caveat in this work is that of the use of metabolite ratios with total creatine. The theoretical basis for its use has been discussed by Connett, 15 who proposed it as a thermodynamically useful normalization in the analysis of bioenergetic processes in tissues that use the creatine kinase system as a mechanism for ATP buffering. In this analysis, a ratio with total creatine provides a measure of its dispersion from baseline, which we would argue that for the metabolites discussed in this work is highly pertinent. Nonetheless, if the creatine transport system itself becomes distorted in the post-status period, such ratios will be problematic. There are relatively few data on this issue, but Gupta et al. 28 found no significant change in total creatine at 3 days in an acetylcholinesterase model of seizures; and Melo, 29 using a pilocarpine model, similarly found no significant changes at 1 month in chronically epileptic rats. We would argue that the 45-min duration of status is comparatively brief and believe that as biomarkers of physiologic functions, the observed metabolic changes stand.",

The generation of the two discrete groups (rather than a conglomeration of one injured group) is the notable observation. That these metabolically identified groups appear to propagate into the 3-week time point argues for the notion that the short <1 h status period seems to generate a tipping point, as discussed earlier. It will be of interest to understand whether these metabolic changes, reflecting their neuronal and glial sources, link with cellular processes of gene expression, remodeling, and inflammation, which may be related to the ultimate development of spontaneous recurrent seizures.",
