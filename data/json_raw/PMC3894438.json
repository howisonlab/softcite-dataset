Although the literature contains a massive amount of information on IM, most of this is related specifically to only children or adults separately. In order to distinguish any differences between preschool children and youth patients, we retrospectively analyzed their demographic and clinical features. Methods: Records of patients hospitalized from December 2001 to September 2011 with a diagnosis of IM were retrieved from Peking University First Hospital, which is a tertiary teaching hospital in Beijing. The demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected. Results: IM was diagnosed in 287 patients during this 10-year period, with incidence peaks among preschool children (\u22647 years old, 130/287, 45.3%) and youth patients (>15 and <24 years old, 101/287, 35.2%). Although the complaints at admission did not differ between these two patient groups, the incidence of clinical signs (tonsillopharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and edema of the eyelids) was much higher in preschool children. The incidence of liver lesion and percentage of atypical lymphocytes were significantly higher in the youth group (P<0.001), and the average hospital stay was longer in this group. Pneumonia was the most common complication, and there was no case of mortality. Conclusions: The incidence of IM peaks among preschool children and youth patients in Beijing, China. The levels of liver enzymes and atypical lymphocytes increase with age."

EBV is a member of the human herpesvirus family, which has a double stranded DNA genome. As other members of herpesivirus family, lifelong latent infection in B lymphocytes is the result of the primary EBV infection. The virus could be reactivated when host immune response is severely impaired, like organ transplant recipient, taking glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressant for a long time, or infected with human immunodeficiency virus."

Preschool children and youth were 2 incident peak groups of IM. Previous studies found that preschool children had the highest incidence of IM in China. 3,[6][7]9 Youths aged 15-to 24-year old were the most common patients with IM in west countries. [4][5]10 There were 2 explanations for the dissimilarities. Firstly, this shifting trend in the onset age of IM in Beijing probably reflects the improvement of China's socioeconomics. This consists with the serological survey in 2008. The seropositive rate decreased from 90% in 1970's to 82.5% in 2008 in preschool children in Beijing. The study also found that much more children in the rural areas (75.3%) suffered primary EBV infection than those lived in the urban areas (67.7%). 3 Similarly shift was found in Japan 1 by comparing seropositive rate in 1995-1999 (59%) with the early 1990s (>80%). Secondly, different study objects from previous reports could be another reasonable explanation. Previous reports only included patients younger than 18-year old [6][7]9,[11][12] or in university http://www.e-cmh.org http://dx.doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2013.19.4.382 students. [13][14] We collected patients with confirmed diagnose of IM at all ages, hospitalized in paediatrics department and non-paediatrics department. Youth patients with over 10% of atypical-lymphocytoes without typical clinical triad of IM also need to find the evidence of EBV infection. The incidence of triad was significant lower in youth patients (74.3%) than in preschool children (90.8%), P<0.001. A significant higher atypical-lymphocyte percentage was one of notable features of our youth patients (Table 4). These were coincident with a previous study in patients aged 18-23 years. 15 They also found a low incidence of triad of 68.2% and the specificity of clinical triad was 41.9% for IM diagnosis.",

Elevated aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase were the features of liver lesion in our study (Tables 1  and 4). Hyperbilirubinemia was not common in our patients (26.4%, 24/91) and disappeared before discharging from hospital. On the contrary, 36.8% of preschool patients had normal liver function and only 2 children had increased total bilirubin. Our results were consistent with previous studies in different age groups. Over 80% of older than 16-year IM patients presented abnormal aminotransferase, especially alanine aminotransferase. 5,10,16 Jaundice was uncommon. 5,10,16 Less than half of children (30.9%, 48.6%) with IM had liver dysfunction. 6,11,17 The mechanism of liver involvement in IM patients was unclear, much less in the discrepancy between different age group. CD3 positive T lymphocytes were identified as the main lymphocytic infiltrate in EBV hepatitis, which were mainly cytotoxic CD8 positive T lymphocytes. [18][19][20] Several studies have shown increased level of inflammatory cytokines in the sera of IM patients. 10,21 Interferon-\u03b3 was a prominent one among these inflammator y c y tokine. Increased level of Interferon-\u03b3 and its catabolic product may induce liver dysfunction. 10,18 Further research about the pathogenesis was warranted.",
