            "text": "The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the Verion-LenSx guided arcuate incision technique to reduce refractive astigmatism in a pseudophakic population. Patients and methods: A prospective single-arm study was conducted in which one or both eyes of subjects required reduction of 1.0-2.0 D of refractive astigmatism after previous cataract surgery or refractive lens exchange. The surgeon used the refractive cylinder in the eye and the Woodcock astigmatism nomogram for preoperative planning, while the LenSx femtosecond laser with the Verion Image Guided System was used to create all arcuate incisions. The primary outcome measure was the uncorrected monocular distance visual acuity (UCVA). Secondary outcome measures included the change in corneal astigmatism, the change in refractive astigmatism, the best-corrected visual acuity and spectacle independence at distance from preoperative stage to 1 month and 2 months postoperatively. Results: Twenty-eight eyes of 18 subjects were treated. The best-corrected visual acuity at the 2-month postoperative (PO) stage was not statistically significantly different from the preoperative visual acuity (0.02 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] in both cases, P.0.05). Uncorrected visual acuity was statistically significantly better at the 2-month PO stage relative to the preoperative value (0.14 versus 0.34 logMAR, P,0.01). The mean change in refractive cylinder from the preoperative stage to the 2-month PO stage was 1.0 D. At the 2-month PO stage, two-thirds of the subjects (12/18) reported that they did not use glasses for distance vision and that their spectacle use for distance vision at 2 months was \"lower\" or \"much lower\" than the preoperative stage; in 71% of eyes (20/28), the residual refractive cylinder was #0.50 D. Vector changes in keratometric astigmatism were weakly associated with changes in refractive cylinder. Conclusion: Arcuate incisions made with a femtosecond laser to treat moderate levels of residual refractive astigmatism after previous cataract surgery may reduce dependence on spectacles for distance vision.",

            "text": "Significant corneal astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery is relatively common; in a large sample of older patients, corneal astigmatism was .1.0 D in one-third of all eyes. 1 If postoperative (PO) refractive astigmatism is of approximately the same magnitude, uncorrected vision will be compromised. 2,3 This can be problematic in patients who wish to reduce their dependence on spectacles, particularly for those implanted with multifocal lenses. 4,5 Surgical options for reducing astigmatism after cataract extraction and lens implantation are limited to corneal refractive surgery (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, photorefractive keratectomy) or corneal relaxing incisions if an intraocular lens (IOL) exchange is not desired. Corneal relaxing incisions are one of the most common methods of reducing low-to-moderate levels of astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery. Historically, these incisions were performed manually with a knife. Results have been mixed; in a large meta-analysis, the average residual astigmatism in 225 eyes receiving relaxing incisions was as high as 1.32 D, and it was suggested that relaxing incisions may not significantly reduce spectacle dependence when compared to cases that do not receive astigmatism-correcting procedures. 6 Two studies included in this meta-analysis show poor reduction of corneal astigmatism (mean change of only 0.18 D) 7 and high spectacle dependence (45% in one study). 8 The latter study reported that 15% of eyes had uncorrected visual acuity worse than 20/40.",

            "text": "The introduction of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery has provided surgeons with the ability to make image-guided laser arcuate incisions to correct residual astigmatism after cataract surgery. Studies show that compared to manual incisions, laser incisions likely allow for improved precision 9 and may be less harmful to tissue, 10 both of which may improve the predictability, safety and effectiveness of astigmatism correction. The mean difference between the intended and achieved laser incision sizes, documented to be within 0.1 mm, 11 shows a precision that cannot be matched with manual techniques. Laser arcuate incisions have been demonstrated to significantly reduce corneal astigmatism. 12,13 The incision may remain closed or may be opened if further astigmatism reduction is deemed necessary. 12 Uncorrected visual acuity has been reported to improve from a mean uncorrected visual acuity of \u223c20/63 preoperatively to \u223c20/30 at 5 months postoperatively. 14 Laser arcuate incisions were demonstrated in one study to provide similar effectivity as toric lenses, 14 in contrast to results with manual incisions, which have been consistently demonstrated to be less effective than toric IOLs. 6 Femtosecond laser systems include image guidance, allowing for great precision with regard to the location, arc length and depth of the corneal incisions they make; this is a likely source of these improved outcomes. To further improve accuracy, separate imaging systems may be used to measure corneal astigmatism and allow for proper orientation of the eye in the upright position to incisions made by the laser in the supine position.",

If created at the time of cataract surgery, incisions are generally based on anterior corneal astigmatism, which will not include the effects of surgical incisions, lens centration and posterior corneal astigmatism. Correction of astigmatism after refractive stability has been achieved can be based on the patient's manifest refraction, which will inherently include the refractive effects of the factors cited earlier. As such, it is possible that corneal arcuate incisions performed after cataract surgery may actually provide better outcomes in the correction of astigmatism.",

In 71% of eyes (20/28), the residual refractive cylinder at 2 months was #0.50 D, while in 93% of eyes (26/28), it was #0.75 D. Only one eye (1.25 D) had a residual refractive cylinder .1.00 D at 2 months; the preoperative refractive cylinder in that eye was 2.00 D. The magnitude of the mean refractive cylinder was 0.25 D lower at 2 months than at 1 month, which was statistically significant (P=0.02), but perhaps not clinically significant, given the challenges in test-retest reliability of refractions. In 79% of eyes (22/28), the refractive cylinder   magnitude at 2 months was equal to or lower than the magnitude at 1 month, and in only one eye was it .0.50 D higher (0.75 D). Preoperatively, 72% of subjects (13/18) reported using their glasses for distance vision all of the time, while another 17% (3/18) reported using them most of the time. At the 2-month PO visit, two-thirds of the subjects (12/18) reported that they did not use glasses for distance vision. Only two subjects (11%) reported using their glasses for distance vision all of the time. Half of the subjects (9/18) reported that their spectacle use for distance vision at 2 months was \"much lower\" than their preoperative use, while two-thirds (12/18) reported it was \"lower\" or \"much lower\". Only one subject reported that spectacle use for distance vision at 2 months was \"higher\" than the preoperative use, but this result was ambiguous; the subject reported not using spectacles at all for distance vision at either the 1-month or 2-month visits, as well as reporting that use was \"lower\" than the preoperative use at the 1-month visit.",

This suggests that, in general, the keratometric change is predictive of the refractive change, so there was no apparent bias related to over-or undercorrection of corneal astigmatism versus refractive astigmatism. A single-sample t-test showed that the percentage change was not statistically significantly different from 100% (P=0.94). Using the same test, the orthogonal (error) term was not statistically significantly different from zero for either the change in refractive cylinder (P=0.28) or the change in keratometric astigmatism (P=0.12). However, the change in the refractive astigmatism from the preoperative to the 2-month postop reading averaged 88%; this was statistically significantly different from 100% (P=0.01). This indicates that the astigmatism was undercorrected by \u223c10%, suggesting that the nomogram might benefit from a 10% increase in treatment. Figure 5 shows a plot of the magnitude of the vector change in IOL Master keratometric astigmatism, in terms of the orientation of the refractive change, versus the change in refractive cylinder at the same orientation, from the preop visit to the 2-month postop visit.

The current study examined visual outcomes from laser arcuate incisions performed on patients who had previous cataract surgery. As the eyes were already pseudophakic, with stable refractions, the incisions were based on refractive cylinder rather than keratometric astigmatism. The primary outcome measure indicated that 80% of eyes gained a line or more of uncorrected visual acuity after the procedure, consistent with the observed reduction in refractive cylinder. UCVA improved on average by two lines at 2 months, which appears consistent with previous findings related to clinical outcomes with laser arcuate incisions. 14 The mean UCVA of 0.14 logMAR at 2 months was similar to that observed in the same time period with toric IOLs. 8,17 With 70% of eyes having #0.5 D of residual refractive cylinder after surgery, results appear as good as those reported in a meta-analysis of toric IOL outcomes, where a pooled average of 71% was calculated. 18 However, the level of astigmatism correction in the current study was more limited (1.0-2.0 D) than for some of the toric studies included in that meta-analysis.",

In addition, the mean change in refractive cylinder was equal to the mean corneal astigmatism change in this study. That is not usually the case when the incision planning is based only on reducing corneal astigmatism. 19 Finally, the correlation coefficient in the current study (0.27) was higher than that observed in arcuate incision studies in the past (0.17 12 and 0.20 20 ). Some of this difference may be due to the use of a laser-specific nomogram (the Woodcock nomogram), but it may also be due to the alignment of the corneal incision with the axis of the residual refractive cylinder in the current study. With regard to the nomogram used, results suggest that a slightly higher value be used to achieve a more \"centered\" distribution of results, as the mean refractive reduction in the current study was 88%.",

This appears consistent with the spectacle independence rates for distance vision with toric IOLs. 17 Figure 5 illustrates that while changes in mean refractive and keratometric cylinders are correlated, there is a fair bit of variability from eye to eye. Some of this variability is likely due to test-retest reliability in the measurement of corneal astigmatism and refractive cylinder. Some of this variability is also likely a function of changes in the posterior cornea, which may not be evident in the keratometry measures but which might affect the refraction. Posterior corneal astigmatism has been demonstrated to be a significant contributor to total corneal astigmatism. 21 The effect of any incision is also dependent on patient-specific factors, particularly specific corneal properties that might affect wound healing. 3 As such, while the nomogram was relatively good for balancing the mean correction, it would appear that some additional variables to help customize the nomogram to individual eyes would be helpful. 20 There are limitations to the current study. The number of subjects was relatively low, sufficient to demonstrate a change in UCVA but insufficient to allow detailed post hoc analysis of the factors that might have influenced the effectiveness of the incisions; as noted herein, such an analysis might lead to better \"customization\" of incisions.
