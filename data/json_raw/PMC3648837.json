Patients with cancer often display dyspnea and fatigue. These are also frequent symptoms in patients with chronic heart failure (HF). The reasons for similar symptoms in cancer patients are unknown. Using the novel Nexfin Finapres technique, we sought to assess measures of cardiac performance in patients with cancer and compare these values with those from control subjects and patients with chronic HF. M Ma at te er ri ia al l a an nd d m me et th ho od ds s: : We prospectively studied 98 patients (control n = 18, chronic HF n = 37, advanced pancreatic or colorectal cancer n = 43) and assessed blood pressure (BP), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and dP/dt max at rest. R Re es su ul lt ts s: : All parameters of interest could be assessed using the Nexfin Finapres technique with SV and CO being significantly higher in patients with cancer than in controls (both p < 0.05). The SV was significantly higher in patients with chronic HF than in controls (p < 0.05). In patients with cancer, SV correlated with age (r =-0.45, p < 0.01) and body weight (r = +0.55, p = 0.0001). In chronic HF, SV declined with increasing age (r =-0.49, p < 0.01); in control subjects, SV increased with increasing body weight (r = +0.57, p = 0.01). C Co on nc cl lu us si io on ns s: : Patients with cancer tended to display elevated BP, CO, SV, and dP/dt max as compared to control subjects and patients with HF. These findings may reveal an elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases in this group."

            "text": "Cardiac performance can be described by various cardiac indices. Although heart failure (HF) is much more than mere pump failure but a multifacetted clinical syndrome, it can be described as the worst perturbation of cardiac performance [1][2][3][4]. One of the most accepted clinical parameters to describe HF severity is left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Unfortunately, LVEF is also the least specific of all indices of contractility [5] and does not provide much insight into how a patient will develop clinically. An ideal parameter would, from a pathophysiological standpoint, be independent of afterload, preload, heart rate, and the state of remodeling. Relations between cardiac pressure and volume come closest to achieving this [6]. Thus, interesting parameters include stroke work and the maximal rate of pressure rise during isovolumic contraction (dP/dt max ) [5], and it would be desirable to measure these parameters non-invasively.",

Based on the volumeclamp method by Panez, it allows blood pressure (BP) monitoring throughout the cardiac cycle. The technique has become a widely accepted substitute for invasive intraarterial BP measurements. Recently, the Nexfin TM monitor became available, allowing not only continuous measurements of BP using the volume-clamp technique, but also calculation of cardiac output (CO). The reproducibility of the Nexfin BP assessment has been validated in several patient populations including healthy subjects [7], pregnant women [8], and in patients undergoing abdominal or orthopedic surgery [9] or surgery with the requirement of cardiopulmonary bypass [10]. The measurement of CO has been validated in the latter group and in critically ill patients on a surgical intensive care unit [11].",

Thus, we included 37 patients with stable chronic HF, 43 patients with advanced cancer, and 18 healthy subjects of similar age. The subjects' characteristics are provided in Table I, and patients' medication in Table II. The diagnosis of chronic HF was based on appropriate clinical signs and symptoms according to current guidelines issued by the European Society of Cardiology [14], together with documented objective evidence of left ventricular diastolic or systolic dysfunction. The etiology of HF was coronary artery disease or dilated cardiomyopathy. No patient with chronic HF had signs of peripheral or pulmonary edema or was limited by exertional angina. We excluded patients younger than 18 years of age, with an acute myocardial infarction and those with a history of unstable angina, or stroke within three months prior to being studied. The diagnosis of cancer (pancreatic cancer, n = 10, colorectal cancer, n = 33) was based on histopathological examination. All patients had advanced cancer stage III or IV, were clinically stable, and received unchanged medication for at least four weeks. All patients with pancreatic cancer were receiving current chemotherapy while in the study, 4 patients gemcitabine only. Six patients were participating in clinical trials to investigate novel chemotherapy regimens, 3 patients a combination of gemcitabine and aflibercept or placebo, 2 patients a combination of gemcitabine with or without sorafenib, and 1 patient a combination of oxaliplatin, folic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and lapatinib. Among patients with colorectal cancer, 29 patients (88%) had undergone surgical tumor resection at the time of examination. A total of 21 patients with colorectal cancer (64%) were receiving current chemotherapy while in the study, 15 of them were receiving 5-fluorouracil, 2 patients capecitabine, 7 irinotecan, 7 oxaliplatin, 8 bevacizumab, 1 cetuximab, 2 panitumumab and 1 mitomycin, according to different regimens. One patient was receiving radiotherapy. In all cohorts we excluded subjects with clinical signs of infection, severe neuro-muscular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dl).

Patients with HF showed lower LVEF and more severe kidney impairment than control subjects or patients with cancer. Hemoglobin values were lower in patients with cancer as compared to control subjects and patients with chronic HF. Likewise, SV was higher in patients with chronic HF than in control subjects. Major determinants for these variables appear to be age and body weight. Hemoglobin seems to have an influence on CO only in control subjects."

            "text": "Elevated resting CO and heart rate predispose patients to develop cardiac disorders such as arterial hypertension [16]. In obese subjects, it is well established that not only CO is augmented, but also SV, and left ventricular filling pressure [17]. Indeed, earlier studies had demonstrated that increases in CO in obese patients are primarily related to higher SV rather than higher heart rate [18]. Increases in CO and SV are necessary to meet the higherthan-usual metabolic requirements in these patients. This is also a likely explanation for increases in both values observed in patients with cancer. Altogether, it appears that patients with cancer tend to have higher values for BP, CO, SV, and also for dP/dt max . This may represent cardiovascular disturbances in this group or at least a higher cardiovascular risk compared to control subjects. The only study that aimed to assess CO in cancer subjects thus far investigated patients with hematological cancer using ultrasound cardiac output monitoring technique. They showed an initial increase in CO after commencement of chemotherapy with a subsequent quick decrease in CO remaining decreased for the rest of time [19]. These results could be explained by severe cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines [13]. Several determinants of cardiac hemodynamics have been discussed in the literature over the last decades. The CO is known to correlate with several factors including increasing age [20] and obesity [16]. Both CO and heart rate can be reduced by use of, for example, \u03b2-blockers. The CO has been shown to be associated with body weight [15,18]. This was also the case in our study in control subjects and in patients with cancer, but not in patients with chronic HF. This fact might be due to the patient cohort studied that presented with significantly higher body weight than all other groups (Table I); however, it is more likely that the use of \u03b2-blockers in patients with chronic HF influenced the presence of this association. Indeed, O'Malley et al. [21] assessed the association between CO and body weight in untreated dogs with experimental heart failure and found a strong positive correlation, similar to our findings in controls and in patients with cancer.",

Thus, comparisons between patient groups such as the one that we did or comparisons before and after therapeutic interventions may be applicable, but the notion of a peripheral measurement should be heeded. Our study has a number of limitations. The number of subjects is small, particular-ly in the group of control subjects, and the distribution of gender, body weight, and hemoglobin was not well matched between groups as our patients were recruited from typical patients attending the out-patient departments of our hospital. This fact should be considered when looking at the data. In addition, we did not perform serial measurements that would allow the analysis of intra-individual changes and the assessment of test reproducibility. Our echocardiography testing remained preliminary in scope, and we were therefore not able to compare findings from the Nexfin technique with our echo data.",

It has been validated using different standard assessments of CO [25][26][27]. It has recently been suggested that the similarity of clinical signs and symptoms of patients with chronic HF and those with cancer may have a basis in cardiac alterations in the patient with cancer [28]. In other words, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and body wasting in patients with advanced cancer may partly be a reflection of developing HF. In our study, patients with cancer tended to show elevated values of BP, CO, SV, and dP/dt max , displaying at least a higher cardiovascular risk in this group. Both CO and heart rate can be reduced by use of, for example, \u03b2-blockers.
