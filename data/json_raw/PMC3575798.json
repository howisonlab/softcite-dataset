However, substitution at the 5-position of uracil can substantially alter the physical (electronic) and chemical properties of the nucleobase, as evidenced by changes in the UV spectra and the values of the pK a (7). The effects of incorporation of FU into DNA on the structure and dynamics of the latter have been studied quite extensively, arguably as a result of the interesting pharmacological properties of this U analog as an anti-cancer agent (8)(9)(10). Interest in other halouracil analogs was primarily focused on their use as radiosensitizing agents in human cancers. BrU and IU were shown to be more effective in killing tumor cells using ionizing radiation (11,12). However, ClU, though an effective mutagen, clastogen and toxicant, as well as an effective inducer of sister-chromatid exchange, is not as sensitive to ionizing radiation as other thymine analogs (3). The relative lack of interest in ClU may explain the fact that a thorough investigation of the impact of the replacement of T with ClU on the base pairing geometry and duplex conformation using structural tools is presently lacking.",

            "text": "To gain a better understanding of the potential structural change due to the replacement of the thymine 5-methyl group by chlorine, we selected the DDD B-form DNA as a template and synthesized four modified DDDs with ClU either located opposite A (ClU7, ClU8, ClU7/8) or opposite G (ClU9). We used crystals of these modified DDDs in complex with BhRNase H to study the geometries of ClU:A and ClU:G pairs as the crystals of the oligonucleotides alone were not of sufficient quality for a detailed structural analysis. In the crystal of the native DDD bound to RNaseH studied earlier (18), protein-DNA contacts in the complex were limited to the backbone of the C:G tracts (underlined) at both ends: CGCGAATTCGCG. Thus, we expected base pairing in the central GAATTC region where we replaced T opposite either A or G by ClU not to be affected by binding of RNase H (Figure 1). Crystals diffracted to resolutions between 1.5 and 1.7 \u00c5 and belong to space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 ( Table 1). The structures were solved by the molecular replacement technique using the protein portion of the complex between RNase H and the native DDD (18) as the search model. All four crystals of the complexes with ClU-modified DDDs are isomorphous (Table 1). However, unlike in the structure of the complex between RNase H and the native DDD where the duplex sits on a dyad and the asymmetric unit contained two protein molecules and two DNA single strands, crystals of the complexes with ClU-modified DDDs feature two independent complexes consisting of RNase H bound to a duplex ( Figure 1A and B). The first of these displays clear electron density around all nucleotides, whereas in the second, the density around the DNA is only partially resolved and either three or four base pairs at one end of the duplex are missing in the individual complex crystals ( Figure 1B and C). Similarly, two (ClU7 crystal structure) and three N-terminal amino acids (ClU7/8 crystal structure) in the RNase H molecules from the second complex could not be resolved in the electron density maps. Examples of the quality of the final electron density are shown in Figure 2 and Supplementary Figures S1-S3.",

In contrast, the second duplex only exhibits interactions with RNase molecules at one end, with the other not being stabilized by protein contacts and jutting out into the solvent ( Figure 1B).

In both cases, the phosphate group of C3 is lodged at the phosphate-binding pocket (Figure 3) that harbors a phosphate of a DNA nucleotide separated by 2 bp from the scissile RNA phosphate in the structure of an RNA:DNA hybrid bound to BhRNase H (30). In the crystal structure of the complex between RNase H and the native DDD, the phosphate of the terminal G12 sits at the active site and thus mimics a phosphate from the RNA strand (18). The phosphate of residue G4 from the paired strand is anchored at the phosphate-binding pocket. Compared with these interaction modes between RNA:DNA hybrid and native DDD and RNase H, ClU-modified duplexes thus exhibit a less intimate interaction with the protein as only phosphates from one strand are contacted by amino acids (P3 by T104, S147 and T148 and P4 by W139; Figure 3). As a consequence, only one Mg 2+ ion (Mg B ) is observed at the protein active site, whereby the ion coordination sphere comprises D71, E109 and four water molecules (Figure 3). In addition to the protein-DNA contacts involving phosphate groups, four residues from a symmetry-related RNase H molecule interact with the terminal base pair of the first duplex. R126 and P177 stack onto the nucleobases of G24 and C1, respectively, and I64 and L179 form hydrophobic interactions with the base and sugar moieties, respectively, of nucleotide C1 (Figures 1A and 3). In the case of the second complex where the symmetry-related RNase H molecule adopts a somewhat different orientation ( Figure 1A, gray RNase H b# versus Figure 1B, magenta RNase H a#), amino acids establishing contacts with the terminal base pair include K143, N170 and T173 ( Figure 1B). However, neither duplex 1 nor duplex 2 in the four crystal structures exhibits interactions between RNase H and A or ClU/T nucleotides from the central tetramer.",

Analysis of the duplexes containing either two or four ClU:A pairs reveals that they are of the standard W-C type with formation of two hydrogen bonds. Comparison between the geometries of ClU:A and T:A pairs by superimposing the ClU7 and ClU8 duplexes ( Figure 4A) or the ClU7/8 and native DDD (31) duplexes ( Figure 4C) demonstrates that replacing the methyl group of T by chlorine is of little consequence. Except for the methyl group carbon and chlorine, whose positions deviate somewhat as a result of the longer C-Cl bond relative to C-CH 3 , the ClU:A and T:A pairs neatly overlap. Similarly, like T:G the ClU:G pair adopts the familiar wobble geometry, with G and ClU being shifted into the minor and major grooves, respectively, under formation of two hydrogen bonds ( Figure 4B). As with the ClU:A and T:A pairs, the superimposition of the ClU9 duplex and a DDD featuring T:G pairs (32) illustrates the nearly identical geometries of the two pairs. Moreover, calculated geometric parameters for these duplexes (27), including rise, twist, x-and y-displacement, etc. (see the Supplementary Material) confirm that chlorine attached at the 5-position of thymine in place of a methyl group does not trigger a substantial difference in either pairing behavior or base pair geometry.",

As mentioned above, RNase H molecules in the crystal structures of the complexes with ClU-modified DDDs contact the duplexes exclusively in the CG portions, either at both ends (duplex 1, Figure 1A) or at only one end (duplex 2, Figure 1B). As a result, a hallmark of the DDD, the narrow A-tract minor groove remains largely unaffected by the interactions with the protein (Figure 5). Introduction of T:G mismatches at the border of the A-tract results in a wider minor groove in the ClU9 and G:T DDDs at the location of the mismatch pairs. However, replacement of T by ClU has no obvious effect on the change in groove width. The depth of the minor groove along the entire dodecamer exhibits much less variation compared with the width and neither G:T mismatch pairs nor ClU:A/G pairs cause any significant changes relative to the native DDD ( Figure 5).",

            "text": "Our investigation of the structure, stability and function of DNA duplexes with ClU in place of T was motivated by the recently demonstrated genome-wide transliteration of T with ClU in E. coli by combining tight metabolic selection and long-term automated cultivation of bacterial populations (13). Among nucleobases, only thymine is unique to DNA and the fact that its metabolism is separated from RNA biosynthesis provides an opportunity to replace it in vivo by starvation and exogenous introduction of unnatural alternatives (33). Incorporation of 5-halogenopyrimidines into DNA was established decades ago (34). Among the analogs with fluoro-, bromo-, chloro-or iodo-substituents, ClU exhibits the closest likeness to T (14), is readily converted to the nucleoside triphosphate in the cell (35) and lacks the photolabile behavior of BrU and IU (36). Starting from an E. coli strain lacking thymidylate synthase and furnishing exogenous ClU instead of T, 25 weeks of selection in a cultivation device yielded a strain with A, G, C and 90% ClU and 10% T in its genome (13). Through additional disruption of the tRNA U54 methyltransferase gene, the ClU content was further reduced to <2%. This T!ClU transliteration was accompanied by more than 1500 A to G and G to A transitions in a particular culture, whereby the former was about twice as common. The frequency of these transitions suggests that ClU is prone to mispairing with G, although it is not clear whether ClU:G resembles the T:G pair in the wobble configuration with two hydrogen bonds or whether the mismatch pair exhibits a different hydrogen bonding pattern as a consequence of subtle changes in pK a , dipole moment and/or hydration of the chlorouracil base compared with thymine (15).",

            "text": "We selected the DDD B-form DNA as a template to analyze the base pairing behavior of ClU opposite either A or G by X-ray crystallography. Because crystals of the DNAs alone did not diffract to high resolution, we decided to determine the structures of their complexes with BhRNase H. We previously found that crystals of complexes between the endonuclease and the native DDD or chemically modified DDDs diffract X-rays to resolutions of around 1.5 \u00c5 (18,29,37). Indeed, all crystals of complexes with ClU-modified DDDs diffracted to better than 1.7 \u00c5 resolution ( Table 1). Two of the complexes feature duplexes with two T:A pairs replaced by ClU:A (ClU7 and ClU8) and a third contains a duplex with all four T:A pairs in the central A-tract of the DDD replaced by ClU:A (ClU7/8). A fourth complex is between BhRNase H and a DDD in which two ClU:G pairs   bracket the central T:A tract. The first three structures illustrate that ClU:A and T:A pairs adopt nearly identical configurations with two hydrogen bonds ( Figures 2, 4A and 4C), thus confirming the earlier observations based on the structure of a B-form DNA duplex with ClU:A pairs analyzed by solution NMR (14). Similarly, the geometry of ClU:G mismatch pairs in the structure of the fourth complex closely resembles that of the T:G pair in the structure of the B-form duplex of the same sequence (32) ( Figure 4B). Crystals of the RNase H complexes were grown at near neutral pH (6.5) and the wobble configuration with two hydrogen bonds confirms previous reports of the similarity of the ClU:G and T:G pairs as analyzed by NMR in solution (15). The similarities at the level of conformation indicate that chlorine appears to closely mimic the methyl substituent of thymine. Indeed, when both bond length and van der Waals radius are taken into account, the two substituents exhibit very similar sterics. The length of the C(5)-Cl bond is clearly longer than that of the C(5)-CH 3 bond (1.73 \u00c5 versus 1.5 \u00c5 , respectively), but the van der Waals radius of a methyl group (2 \u00c5 ) exceeds that of chlorine (1.75 \u00c5 ) by roughly the same amount. Thus, the two substituents will be nearly indistinguishable for a protein probing the major groove of a B-form duplex. Indeed, we demonstrate here that EcoRI cuts the ClU7-, ClU8-and ClU7/8 DDDs with two or more Ts in the recognition site replaced by ClU ( Figure 6). Conversely, replacing the C:G pairs in the target sequence with either T:G or ClU:G mismatches abolishes cleavage by EcoRI. Chlorine not only mimics the native methyl substituent of thymine, thus allowing ClU:A pairs to evade recognition by enzymes, but replacement of T opposite A by ClU does not lead to any obvious changes in the thermodynamic stability of B-form DNA (Table 2). Also, T:G and ClU:G mismatch pairs result in very similar losses of stability. The stability data support the notion that chlorine and methyl at the 5-position of uracil are basically interchangeable. Although chlorine can, in principle, participate in halogen bonds (38), the observed distances between chlorine and phosphate oxygens in the ClU-modified DDD structures are all clearly above the sum of the van der Waals radii for Cl and O (3.27 \u00c5 ): minimum 5.09 \u00c5 , maximum 6.23 \u00c5 and average 5.49 \u00c5 . Chlorine atoms are also poorly hydrated and the shortest contact between a chlorine and water in our structures is 3.71 \u00c5 and thus not indicative of a hydrogen bond. Similar melting temperatures established for the native DDD and the ClU-modified DDDs are also inconsistent with differential polarizations of the thymine and chlorouracil nucleobases as this should affect stacking and thus stability.",

            "text": "The similarity between ClU and T in terms of pairing properties, conformation and duplex stability helps rationalize the successful outcome of the in vivo evolution of E. coli strains that rely on a ClU, A, C, G alphabet instead of T, A, C, G (13). It is unlikely that a similar success could be achieved with the FU or BrU analogs that exhibit more significant steric and stereoelectronic deviations from T compared with ClU. Although we found in one instance (EcoRI) that an enzyme appeared to ignore the switch from a methyl group to chlorine in the major groove, T ! ClU base substitution changes groove geometry and electrostatics in a subtle fashion and may affect nucleic acid recognition by proteins involved in replication and transcription. Indeed, in vitro kinetic assays of DNA polymerization using human polymerase b and E. coli DNA polymerase I exo -Klenow fragment with templates containing either ClU or T showed facilitated incorporation of dGTP opposite ClU compared with T, particularly at increased values of pH (i.e. 9.0) (39). A high mutation rate is important for the evolutionary process and the massive number of A ! G mutations seen in the adaptation of E. coli to ClU in place of T is consistent with facile formation of the ClU:G wobble pair.",

(B) The duplex in the second complex (colored in beige) is contacted by two RNase H molecules (colored in pink or magenta) and four C:G pairs at one end of the duplex are not visible in the electron density map. (C) The superimposition of the two independent complexes illustrates that the ClU8-DDDs exhibit similar conformations and virtually identical orientations of the original RNase H molecule relative to the DNA duplex. ClU residues are labeled and chlorine atoms are highlighted as light green spheres, selected water molecules are shown as cyan spheres, RNase H amino acids interacting with the DNA are labeled and the so-called phosphate (P-) binding site is marked by an arrow.",
