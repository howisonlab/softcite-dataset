            "text": "Legal changes in the patentability of software since the mid 1990s have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of patents on software inventions. We focus here on the impact of transactions costs associated with patent \"thickets\" on new entrants' interactions with the capital markets. Using data on the financing of entrants into 27 narrowly defined software markets, we show that start-up software companies operating in markets characterized by denser patent thickets saw their initial acquisition of VC funding delayed relative to firms in markets less affected by patents after the mid 1990s. The relationship between patent thickets and subsequent financing activity such as IPO or acquisition is more complex, but there is weak evidence that firms without patents became less likely to go public if they operated in a market characterized by patent thickets. Firms with patents are more likely to be funded or experience a liquidity event. However, the application for a patent appears to matter more than its grant.

            "text": "Patents and entrepreneurship are intimately linked. For many new ventures, intellectual property rights are an important asset that provides protection from imitation or a basis for contracting in the market for technology. At first blush, therefore, it may seem obvious that strengthening patent rights or expanding the scope of the patent system would stimulate entrepreneurship. Yet many economists and legal scholars have grown skeptical about whether the current U.S. patent system is promoting or hindering innovation. As one prominent researcher in the field, Adam Jaffe, has stated in testimony before Congress \"the patent system-intended to foster and protect innovation-is generating waste and uncertainty that hinder and threaten the innovative process.\" 1 These concerns are most acute in industries such as software and semiconductors, where products are highly complex, each embodying thousands of innovations, and where technological progress tends to be incremental and cumulative. In such circumstances, critics argue, any \"stimulating\" effect of stronger patents on incentives to innovate will be offset, or even swamped, by the \"stifling\" effect of higher transactions costs, increased threat of litigation, and constraints imposed on the cumulative development of technologies by multiple blocking patents.",

The software industry provides an unusual and interesting opportunity to evaluate the impact of changes in patent rights on innovation and entrepreneurship. Software has been an important locus of innovation in the U.S. economy, and one where entrepreneurial ventures have played a particularly important role in driving technological change. Yet much foundational innovation occurred in the absence of strong patent protection, and until relatively recently many leading innovators in the industry, including highly visible firms like Microsoft, filed relatively few patents. Only after changes in patent law and USPTO practice in the mid 1990s generated a surge in patenting in software (that continues unabated) did patents become an important aspect of competition. The industry thus presents a \"quasi-experiment\" in which these policy changes may allow the impact of patents on new ventures to be much more clearly distinguished than in contexts where high levels of patenting have always been present.",

Software products are highly complex, with even quite modest products containing millions of lines of code and thousands or tens of thousands of interrelated component modules, any of which could potentially infringe one or more patents. With several hundred thousand software patents issued in the United States since 1990, 2 and ever-greater complexity and scale of software products, the cost of \"clearing\" new products for potential infringement can be very large. Even where an innovator can identify which patents it may need to license or invent around, if very large numbers of patents are potentially infringed the total \"tax\" on entry to the market may be prohibitively high. Where, as Shapiro suggests, these patents form \"a dense web of overlapping intellectual property rights that a company must hack its way through in order to actually commercialize new technology\" 3 or where the entrant has to bargain with large numbers of licensors, additional transactions costs associated with clearing a path to market may be very substantial.",

Unfortunately these data are generally poor, and measurement challenges are particular severe in software. Data on licensing transactions, for example, is very sparse and highly selective, 5 though see Cockburn et al. (2008) which examines the relationship between patent thickets and the extent to which small and medium enterprises in German manufacturing engage in licensing. Research on these issues has therefore tended to focus on indirect measures of the impact of patents, such as the stock market value of companies (see e.g., Hall and MacGarvie, 2006). In software, one useful indicator of technical change-recognizing the important role of new ventures in driving innovation in this industryis market entry and the founding and financing of new firms. Here we focus on the effect of thickets on the ability of new entrants to finance market entry by secure external funding from various sources, a critical economic mechanism in this and other sectors, and one through which patents play an important role in determining incentives to launch new products and new ventures. 6 We hypothesize that patent thickets affect the ability of software start-ups to raise money from outside investors in two main ways. First, the transaction costs of entering a market may be higher when that market has a patent thicket. Patents that block a would-be entrant from producing or selling its product mean that the entrant must either bear additional costs of \"inventing around\" such patents, pay licensing fees to the patent holder, or accept potentially severe ex post penalties from launching its product \"at risk\" of infringement litigation. 7 One dimension of a patent thicket is thus the number of the patents that an entrant may potentially infringe, where more patents impose a proportionately higher \"tax\" on entrants. Suppose an entrant was to 5. See Robbins (2008). Public auctions of IP such as those conducted by Ocean Tomo in recent years are provocative, but cover only very small and highly selective samples of patents.",

However, particularly in complex technologies, patents are frequently bundled or pooled, or jointly licensed, thus total costs of entry may not have a simple linear relationship to the number of patents blocking the would-be entrant. In particular, costs imposed by a thicket may also reflect the structure of ownership of these patents (Ziedonis, 2004). For example, transactions costs associated with bargaining with licensors may be lower when ownership of patents is more concentrated. To the extent that there are fixed costs of conducting a negotiation, having to conduct fewer negotiations will lower costs. A licensee may be able to get better terms per patent when negotiating with a relatively small number of licensors who each control large bundles of patents. Conversely, where the entrant has to conduct a complex bargaining process with many licensors, each of whom has some holdup power, higher total costs may be incurred-that is., the height of the \"royalty stack\" may rise nonlinearly in the number of its components. Noel and Schankerman (2006) provide evidence on the costs imposed by patent thickets from a sample of publicly traded software firms by showing that market value decreases when patent rights held by a firm's competitors are more fragmented, reflecting the higher costs of negotiating with more parties.",

Lemley and Shapiro (2005) argue that there are two types of uncertainty associated with patents: uncertainty about the commercial value of the property right granted to the inventor, and uncertainty about the validity and scope of the property right. The latter form of uncertainty may be especially prevalent in software, a field in which patents were until recently not used to protect IP and which saw a dramatic growth of patenting following changes in the USPTO's patentability guidelines in the mid 1990s. The lack of experience with software patents at the USPTO, combined with the ambiguity associated with what is covered by many patents in this sector, has meant that software developers face significant uncertainty about existing prior art and the possibility of being sued for infringement. Bessen and Meurer (2008) find that software patents are more than twice as likely as other patents to have claim construction appealed to the Federal Circuit, and, which they take as an indicator of elevated uncertainty about the boundaries of patents in software. 8 8. Brian Kahin (2004)  We look for evidence of the impact of increased transaction costs and greater uncertainty on new ventures in \"thicketed\" markets in the following ways. First, higher anticipated transaction costs should affect negatively affect investors' valuations of start-up companies, \"raising the bar\" for new entrants in terms of meeting minimum levels of profitability required by outside inventors, and thus reducing the number of entrants that receive funding from outside investors. Once a firm becomes an incumbent, the effect of thickets is less clear: thickets may offer protection from entrants, or result in future additional transaction costs, with an ambiguous effect on the value of the enterprise and the probability that a firm is able to create a \"liquidity event\" for early-stage investors by going public or being acquired. Second, higher uncertainty about future profits should affect the timing of investments. When investments are irreversible, the opportunity cost of current investment (versus investment at a later date) increases with uncertainty about future profits. Thus, all else equal, increases in uncertainty increase the value of delaying investment. 9 We hypothesize that higher levels of uncertainty over the threat of litigation or other future patent-related costs increases the value of delaying investments in anticipation of information such as court rulings that clarify the scope of relevant patents, or the results of \"field testing\" licensing and enforcement strategies. As a result, we expect that, after controlling for firm-and investor-level characteristics, firms operating in markets characterized by larger or more fragmented patent thickets, or markets in which the relevant prior art is less well defined, will see investments delayed. We look for evidence of delay in duration models for the timing of investment at two points in the lifecycle of new ventures: the time elapsed from the birth of a new venture until it obtains its first round of funding from outside investors (both venture capitalists and corporate investors), and the time elapsed between the first round of funding and \"exit\" from the entrepreneurial phase via IPO or acquisition. This transition often marks a significant change in entrepreneurial ventures' ability to generate significant profits, and in their business model, capital requirements, scale of operation, and management. 10 that: \"TI has something like 8000 patents in the United States that are active patents, and for us to know what's in that portfolio, we think, is just a mind-boggling, budget-busting exercise to try to figure that out with any degree of accuracy at all.\" Kahin notes that, \"If a company with TI's resources cannot assess what they have in-house, it is difficult to expect a small company entering a market to evaluate what claims they may be facing.\" 9. Arrow (1968), Bernanke (1983), Dixit and Pindyck (1994), among others. 10.

These patents may then act to reduce the transaction costs associated with operating in a \"thicketed\" market. These firms should also face less uncertainty, and thus we expect investment will take place earlier.",

First, we provide novel empirical evidence on several aspects of the impact of patent thickets on early-stage firms. Using a differences-indifferences methodology that uses shifts in the software patent regime to identify the effects of interest, we find that patent thickets make it more difficult for early-stage firms to obtain initial funding. The impact of patent thickets on the ability of firms to \"exit\" from the start-up phase via IPO or acquisition, is more ambiguous, however, there is evidence that the negative effect of thickets intensified following changes in patentability and that this effect was felt disproportionately by firms without patents of their own. We consistently find a positive correlation between the firm's own patent holdings and \"success\" in financing transactions. Interestingly, however, we observe that it is the number of patents pending, rather than the number of patents already granted, which matters in our regressions. This raises important questions about the value of patents as property rights relative to their value as signals of quality.",

Studies of the impact of quasi-natural experiments associated with legal changes to patent regimes on innovation include Branstetter and Sakakibara (2001), Lanjouw and Cockburn (2001), Moser (2005), Scherer and Weisburst (1995), Branstetter et al. (2006), Lerner (2002), and Hall and Ziedonis (2001). On software patents in particular, negative effects of more-and-stronger patent rights have been found by Bessen and Maskin (2007) and Bessen and Hunt (2007). See also Noel and Schankerman (2006), Hall (2005) and Hall and MacGarvie (2006) for evidence on the impact of patents on market value of software firms, and Mann (2006) who shows that software start-ups holding patents receive more investment from venture capitalists than those without patents. Arora et al. (2001), Gans and Stern (2000), Gans et al. (2002), and others have highlighted the role of patents and other formal IP rights in supporting a \"market for technology,\" which provides an avenue for new entrants to realize value from innovation by licensing, or selling themselves to incumbents. Hsu and Ziedonis (2007) show that a doubling in a start-up firm's patent stock is associated with a 24% increase on average in investors' valuations.",

We look at the impact of patent thickets at two levels. In the first set of regressions presented here we look at the marketlevel association between patents and aggregate volumes of entry and financing activity.

Motivations for firms to file patents are, however, complex. Incumbents may well apply for patents strategically to deter entry, to raise the costs of rivals already in the market, or to protect themselves from litigation (Ziedonis, 2004), thus making the size of the thicket in a given market endogenous with respect to competition. But patenting behavior may also reflect other factors such as the use of patents as part of internal systems for providing incentives or monitoring employees, or the firm's participation in other patent-intensive industries (such as hardware). 11 Other aspects of the institutional context of this study and of our estimation methods also suggest that any endogeneity bias is quite limited, and to the extent that it does affect our estimates it will bias coefficients toward zero, leading to underestimates rather than overestimates of any causal effect of patent thickets. In all of our regressions we use market fixed effects, so that our identification comes from within-market changes in the patent thicket and the outcomes of interest rather than from purely crosssectional correlations. It is also important to recognize that the timing of incumbents' patent grants (or their ability to obtain patent protection at all) is in large part affected by exogenous changes in resources and policy at the patent office. The average time between patent application and grant in our dataset is close to 3 years. 12 Given the high speed of product cycles and turnover in the software industry, incumbents filing patents in response to threats from competitors will in most cases be unable to use the granted patents until well after entry has taken place, and the infringing product has been superseded. Because of this, a substantial portion of the thicket faced by entrants in any market is composed of patents obtained far in the past, and by noncompetitors. Thus, after controlling for time-invariant unobserved effects, and a variety of other potential sources of bias (such as confounding growth in the patent thicket with maturity of the technology in a market), endogeneity of our thicket measures created by incumbents' responses to time-varying shocks to the threat of entry appears not to be a major issue. 13 11. Allison et al. (2007) describes the patent filing behavior of several large players in the industry, showing that IBM was an early patenter while firms like Adobe, Autodesk, Computer Associates and Oracle came late to the software patent game (in terms of applications filed). While a detailed examination of the various motivations for patenting by the firms in our sample is indeed an interesting subject for future research, we focus here on the observed patterns of patenting and entry and investment rather than on documenting the organizational processes at work.",

In this model, for any there to any bias arising from a correlation between financing/entry and patents induced by omitted variables, the relationship between financing/entry and the omitted variable(s) in question would have to occur simultaneously with the changes in software patentability that took place during our sample. 14",

This self-reported variable can include products under development as well as products already launched. CorpTech reports more than 290 SOF categories; however, many of these are quite vaguely defined, or appear to be defined in terms of customer segments rather than in terms of a technology-for example, \"secondary school software, dental practice management software, etc.\" Furthermore mapping patents to markets is a challenging and resource-intensive task. We therefore focus our analysis on 27 of these SOF-defined markets, listed in Table AI. These 27 markets were chosen primarily to facilitate subsequent mapping to patent data, primarily on the basis of our assessment as to whether the technology/product is reasonably distinctive, and we could define a set of keywords that could be fruitfully searched in the abstract of patent documents. 18 Table I gives summary statistics for the number of firms of various types averaged over successive years and across markets. On average, 15.4 firms entered a market in the 2-year period between CorpTech sample years. The number of \"de novo\" entrants, as opposed to firms, which are new to the market in question, but already have an established presence in other markets, is quite small, averaging 3.05 per market per year. (This figure is likely to be an underestimate of the fraction of entrants into these markets that are \"new,\" reflecting issues with the way that CorpTech collects data, and our screen for identifying new versus continuing ventures.) 19 Among these new entrants, 16% receive external funding from VCs prior to the year in which they enter the market, while 6% receive funding from a corporate investor at this point in their lifecycle. There is substantial variation in rates of entry in the cross-section and over time, with the number of entrants ranging from 0 to 104 per sample year. We do not have data on market-specific sales, but we construct a proxy for total sales based on the sales of firms that are active in a 19. Firms are treated as de novo entrants if the firms are younger than 10 years old and specialize in only one of CorpTech's main software product classes, e.g. AI: artificial intelligence. market. 20 On average, markets in this sample have a total of $2.7bn in annual sales, with substantial growth over time.

Cockburn and MacGarvie (2007) describe in detail the process used to match USPTO patent classifications to the CorpTech SOF categories using an adaptive/iterative algorithm that combines keyword searching of the abstracts and titles of patents with the technology class codes applied by the USPTO. 21 Using the mapping between patent classes and CorpTech product markets described above, we obtained all the relevant patents in these classes from the NBER Patent Database. There is a striking increase in the volume of patenting over time: annual patent grants relevant to this set of 27 product markets increased more than 40-fold between 1980 and 2006, from 366 per year to 16,285 per year. We base our analysis on \"patents in force\" in any particular year, that is, net of patents that have reached the end of their term or were not renewed. These expirations represent a nontrivial fraction of the total number of patents in force: in the late 1990s, for example, new patents were being added to the sample at a rate of about 7,000 per year, while about 1200 were being removed from the \"patent stock.\" Table I gives descriptive statistics for the patent landscape in the 27 product markets considered here. In total we identified 108,863 patents issued since 1977 that are relevant to the set of markets considered. (Some of these are relevant to more than one market.) There are very substantial changes over time in the observable characteristics of these patents. The average number of claims per patent doubled between 1980 and 2006, from 12.6 to 22.4, while the average number of backward citations per patent almost tripled over this period, rising from 7.2 to 19.1 and the average number of citations to nonpatent literature increased 20. For firm i active in in market j as well as n-1 other markets, we compute average sales per market in market j as SALES i /n (the total sales of the firm divided by the number of markets in which it is active). We then add up the average sales per market for all firms active in the market. CorpTech contains a numerical sales variable as well as a categorical variable that indicates the range in which the firm's revenues fall. A significant portion of observations on the former are missing, and we fill in these observations with the midpoint of the range indicated by the categorical sales variable.",

Following Ziedonis (2004) and Noel and Schankerman (2006) we hypothesize that a key factor driving transactions costs may be the degree to which ownership of patent rights is fragmented, and capture this second effect by measuring the concentration of IP ownership in each market using patent citations. 24 Patent citations are references to existing patented technologies, listed in the patent document. 25 Because these citations delimit the property rights represented by a patent by describing related claims contained in other patents, citations made by a patent give an indication of the extent to which a technological area is already covered by intellectual property rights and is thus (in principle) foreclosed to entrants who do not obtain a license. Assuming that the share of citations received by an assignee proxies the importance of negotiating with that assignee, we postulate that, in a market that has many cited assignees but where citations go disproportionately to a small number of firms, entry costs may actually be lower than in a market with fewer assignees each of which receives a similar share of total citations. To capture this effect, we calculate the Herfindahl index of citations over assignees for each market in each year. 26 The number of cited assignees is quite the loss in value of assets stranded in the wake of an injunction obtained by the patent holder.",

We want to separate the effects of increased patenting at any given stage of the technology life cycle from the natural accumulation of larger patent stocks as time passes. To control for the average maturity of technology in the product market, we use the modal citation lag. Because the number of citations to a patent is a function of the number of potential citations, we estimate the modal lag using a framework that adjusts for this effect. For each product class and citing-cited year pair, we compute the citation frequency, or ratio of actual to potential citations (see Jaffe and Trajtenberg, 1999), and then identify the citation lag (citing year-cited year) with the highest citation frequency for a given product class and citing year. 27 If the modal lag in a product category is short, it implies that the most highly cited patents in that market were granted recently, which suggests that the market is at a relatively early stage of the product cycle. 28",

Based on discussions with practitioners and our reading of the ongoing debates about \"patent quality\" we identify two aspects of patents that may signal that their scope and validity may be difficult to assess. First, we look at the number of nonpatent references cited as prior art. Software patent applications (and their review by the patent office) have been widely criticized for failing to recognize or consider relevant prior art in the form of articles in professional journals, trade press, widely circulated product manuals and the like, which could potentially have sharply reduced the scope of claims allowed. According to this view, patents with very few citations to this type of prior art are more likely to be held invalid if subjected to legal challenge. (Of course, it may be that such patents reflect truly innovative inventions for which 27. We compute the citation frequency as the ratio of the number of observed citations to the number of potential citations. That is, if Ckgd is the number of citations made to patents in market k in citing year g to patents granted in market k in cited year d, Pkg is the number of patents granted in class k in year g, and Pkd is the number of patents granted in class k in year d, the citation frequency is Ckgd/(Pkg Pkd).",

One of the USPTO's recent initiatives to improve patent quality has been to limit the number of claims in a patent to no more than 25 (with no more than 5 independent claims.) Further, Allison et al. (2004) show that patents with larger numbers of claims are more likely to be litigated, and while the likelihood of litigation is undoubtedly related to the value of the patent, it is also more likely to occur when parties disagree over the validity or scope of the patent-that is, when there is greater uncertainty. 29 As a measure of this type of uncertainty about the strength of a patent we calculate the ratio of the number of claims allowed on a patent to the number of patents (both U.S. and foreign) cited. Our reasoning is that patents with a very large number of claims and very few citations to prior art are whose validity and scope are likely to be particularly difficult to assess. (Such patents are sometimes referred to by practitioners as \"problem patents.\") One difficulty with this measure is that low numbers of backward cites may simply reflect the \"newness\" or novelty of the invention rather than poor examination (or strategic behavior by the applicant). However, it is uncorrelated with the model citation lag, which we believe more directly captures \"newness,\" suggesting that it is capturing an independent dimension of the data.",

            "text": "As discussed above, we also present \"differences-in-differences\" estimates that make use of the fact that the expansion of software patentability took place at different times for different types of software. Though driven to some extent by pressure from patent applicants, arguably these changes are exogenous to the extent of the patent thicket in a particular market. Briefly, these regime changes were as follows. In 1972, the Supreme Court's ruling in Gottschalk v. Benson held that because software is essentially a collection of algorithms, it could not be patented. However, in 1981 in the Diamond v. Diehr ruling, the court allowed for patenting of software tied to physical or mechanical processes, such as the program implemented in the method for curing rubber at issue in the case. While patents were granted during the 1980s for inventions with a substantial software component, and the distinction between patentable and nonpatentable subject matter in this area was progressively shifted and weakened by various court decisions and creative drafting of patent claims, the effectiveness of patent protection for software was far from clear, with many leading software companies filing only limited numbers of applications, or eschewing software patents altogether. This uncertainty was resolved in the mid 1990s, when the 1994 Federal Circuit decision In re Alappat drew a definitive distinction between unpatentable software in the form of \"a disembodied mathematical concept. . .which in essence represents nothing more than a 'law of nature,' 'natural phenomenon,' or 'abstract idea'\" and patentable software that is \"rather a specific machine to produce a useful, concrete, and tangible result.\" 30 A series of further court decisions in 1994 and 1995 following Alappat culminated in a new set of guidelines, issued by the Commissioner of Patents in May of 1996, which allowed inventors to patent any software embodied in physical media. 31 Further expansion of software patentability came in with the State Street Bank & Trust vs. Signature Financial Corp. (\"State Street\") decision, which eliminated the requirement that the software algorithm be tied to a \"physical transformation.\" This evolution of legal and administrative doctrine means that some categories of software patents became more clearly obtainable, and more easily enforceable before others. While software used in manufacturing or \"embedded\" in hardware devices was covered prior to the 1996 change in guidelines, software more generally was covered after 1996, and financial or business methods software became clearly patentable after State Street in 1998. The markets in our sample fall into three groups that were affected by these \"regime changes\" at different times: those for which software was patentable before 1996 (manufacturing software), those for which it became patentable in 1996 (other types of software not including those affected by State Street), and those for whom patentability increased in 1998 (financial software and business methods algorithms). Using the standard differences-indifferences specification, we therefore include in the regression the log of the number of patents in a market, the regime-change dummy, and the interaction of the latter two variables. The coefficient on this interaction term gives the change in the effect of the market's patents on the dependent variable following the expansion of the strength of patents that are relevant to the market. Figure 3 shows the average number of patents granted in each market, grouped by the applicable regime change. As the figure shows, changes in the volume of patenting and the timing of these changes behave quite differently across the three groups, reflecting the differential impact of the regime changes in 1996 and 1998. Group 1, the set of software markets characterized by manufacturing applications, shows a stable increase over time. Group 2, the set we classify as primarily affected by the legal decisions following Alappat and the change in USPTO guidelines as of 1996, sees a dramatic jump after 1996 followed by a return to trend. 32 Markets in the third group, which were affected by Alappat but also by State Street in 1998, see an increase after 1996 and continue to grow until 2000, when the USPTO began performing more rigorous examinations of business methods patents (the \"second pair of eyes\"). This change may account for the dip in the number of patents 31. Sterne and Bugaisky, p. 223. 32. As a robustness check, we have also used 1994 (the year of the Alappat decision) as the date at which software became generally patentable.

As argued above, one mechanism through which this effect may operate is the financing of early-stage firms. If increases in barriers to entry reduce the expected profitability of entrants, they will also reduce their attractiveness to investors and may make it more difficult for de novo entrants to raise capital. Note that coefficient on the interaction term with the regime shift dummy (the \"treatment effect\" from strengthening patent rights in the market) is the average treatment effect measured in terms of elasticities. Though it is negative and statistically significant at the 5% level, this coefficient conceals substantial differences across individual market-year observations the marginal \"treatment effect\" measured in numbers of entrants. Table II reports estimates of the marginal effect of the interaction term at 35. In regressions not reported here (but available upon request) we split the sample into \"small\" markets (with a number of incumbents below the median for that year) and \"large\" markets, to investigate the hypothesis that transaction costs matter more for entry into small markets while uncertainty is a more significant barrier to entry when the stakes are high. We found that the smaller markets had a larger patent elasticity (i.e. the effects of transaction costs are more substantial), and the effects of the average number of claims per citation were insignificant, while the share of non patent prior art was positive and significant. In larger markets, the number of patents in the market has a less negative but still statistically significant coefficient, while the effect of uncertainty as measured by the claims/cite ratio is stronger and more significant. The share of non patent prior art is not significantly related to entry in large markets. the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the market size distribution. 36 Individual estimated treatment effects are all negative, although some are quite small and not statistically distinguishable from zero. Larger marginal effects tend to be found in markets with more incumbent firms, suggesting a more complex relationship between the patent landscape and competition than is captured by this simple regression model.",

We also recognize that there may be difficulties in identifying this effect separately from other factors affecting IPOs.

Estimates larger than one indicating a positive effect on the hazard of receiving funding, and estimates less than one indicating a negative effect. In general the hazard of funding is nonlinearly related to the number of competitors in the market, with an initial increasepresumably reflecting an increase in expected profits due to a reduction in the market power of incumbents or a reduction of barriers to entry created by network effects-then falling as the number of incumbents increases, which could reflect the fact that large numbers of incumbents indicate more mature, more crowded, and less attractive markets. The dummies for the range of firm size (not reported, but available upon request) display a concave relationship between firm size and the hazard of initial funding. The standard errors in these regressions are somewhat sensitive to the selection of control variables, but adding or dropping control variables has little effect on the estimated coefficients on the patent variables.",

In column (2), the differences-in-differences specification shows that the negative effect of patent thickets is larger in markets where patent rights were strengthened relative to those where it was not. A one standard deviation increase in the number of patents in the market is associated with a reduction in the hazard of being funded of about one percentage point. This effect is much larger after the regime changes, with for a one standard deviation increase in the patent stock in the market associated with a 0.04 reduction in the hazard of funding. Given that the mean probability of obtaining funding in a given year is 0.086 overall and 0.101 after the regime changes, this effect appears to be of considerable importance.

(We report results only for the post-regime subsample. Coefficients were insignificant but of the same sign and similar magnitude when the same specification was used on the full sample.) In contrast to the hypotheses about bargaining costs and the concentration of patent ownership discussed above, we find a negative and borderline significant (with a pvalue of 0.051) effect on the hazard of receiving initial funding. In other words, an initial round of funding by external investors is less likely to be 44. To limit the influence of a small number of outliers in the number of patents granted and pending, we winsorize these variables at the 99.9 th percentile. Similar results were obtained using lower percentile cutoffs. obtained by software ventures operating in markets where IP ownership is more concentrated. Our alternative measure of bargaining costs, a quadratic in the number of cited assignees, was not significant. This finding contrasts with other papers in the literature, such as Ziedonis (2004) and Noel and Schankerman (2007). It is more consistent with an alternative story laid out in Galasso and Schankerman (2008), in which increases in fragmentation of ownership of IP reduce the amount at stake in licensing negotiations and thus reduce the probability of litigation. Table V presents results of a model of the probability that a new venture ultimately \"exits\" from the entrepreneurial phase by going public or being acquired by another firm, as opposed to continuing to operate as an independent privately held firm (or being liquidated.) Most of the information on the dates of IPO or M&A comes from VentureXpert. For a subset of firms that are listed on CorpTech as having gone public or been acquired by 2002, we performed lexis-nexis and web searches to obtain the dates of these events. Firms that were founded after 1990 and are listed as private on CorpTech as of 2002 for which there is no date of IPO on VentureXpert are assumed not to have gone public in the interim. 45 Although not all of the firms contained in the time-tofirst funding sample analyzed in Table IV are included in the dataset analyzed in Table V, the number of observations in Table V is larger than  in Table IV because firms exit the time-to-first funding sample once they receive their first round of funding. The market-level variables are as described above. 46 The unit of observation for this analysis is a calendar year, and in columns (1), (2), and (3) we use a Cox proportional hazard model.

One often underemphasized means by which patents can affect technical change, industry dynamics, and ultimately welfare, is through their role in stimulating or stifling entry by new ventures. The mechanisms through which patents can impact this process are, as ever, complex. Patents can block entry, or raise entrants' costs in variety of ways, while at the same time they may stimulate entry by improving the bargaining position of entrants vis-\u00e0-vis incumbents, and supporting a \"market for technology,\" which enables new ventures to license their way into the market, or realize value through other forms of trade in their intangible assets.

Firms in \"thicketed\" markets with large numbers of patents are less likely to receive funding from outside investors at both early and late stages in the entrepreneurial process compared to those in markets with fewer patents. In aggregate, start-up software companies operating in markets characterized by larger patent thickets see their initial round of VC or corporate funding delayed relative to firms in markets less affected by patents. In firm-level analyses that control for additional characteristics of start-up firms, we find similar results. We also find that changes in the legal regime that strengthened patent rights made the association between patents in a market and the probability of receiving initial outside funding significantly more negative. Our results suggest that there is less entry into markets where patents on average have a higher ratio of claims made to the amount of prior cited, which we interpret as a proxy for uncertainty about the quality of patents in a market. However, these results were not found in the firmlevel models of timing of funding from outside investors or liquidity events.",

Firms that have higher numbers of their own patents are more likely to receive funding from outside investors, and more likely to subsequently \"exit\" from the entrepreneurial phase through IPO or acquisition. Interestingly, the number of a firm's patents pending is positively and significantly related to the probability of obtaining external funding, while the number of patents already granted is notholding constant the number of patents granted, outside investors appear to be more focused on these firms' \"pipeline\" of IP assets under development. The estimated effect is quite large: each additional patent pending increases the hazard of funding by around 15%.",

            "text": "One interpretation of these results is simply that patents reflect the value of the firm's technology: firms with higher quality innovations obtain more patents and are also more attractive to outside investors. However, patents may also convey other information. For example these findings may in part reflect the value to outside investors of the ability to obtain patents as signal of the quality of a new venture's management. Hsu and Ziedonis (2007) show that larger numbers of patent applications are associated with higher valuations of early-stage semiconductor companies, and attribute this in part to factors other than the information about a firm's technology that is provided by patents. Beyond this \"capabilities\" argument, we suggest that when faced with a patent thicket, patents also confer significant competitive advantages on entrant firms in minimizing transactions costs associated with incumbents' patent holdings.",

Nonetheless, we find it striking that only 20% of the firms in our funding regression sample (and only 33% of the firms that ultimately got funding) ever filed for a patent during our sample period. If the benefits from holding patents are as substantial as our results suggest, it is puzzling why more of the firms that were active in these markets during this period did not obtain them. One explanation may be that causality between funding and patent applications runs in the opposite direction: it may be that investors require early-stage firms to file patent applications as a condition of receiving funds, or that applications are observed disproportionately by firms that get funding and are more able to support the substantial costs of patent prosecution. In these data we only observe applications that are subsequently granted, so this may be a significant source of bias if large numbers of unobserved applications are abandoned by firms who are not funded.",

One area in which our sample differs, however, is in terms of the average number of patents held by firms active in the market. The average firm active in one of the sample markets has 29 patents, while the average firm in a market omitted by the sample has only 18 patents, and this difference is statistically significant. Note though that this difference arises by construction: it is difficult, if not impossible to identify patents related to many of the more vaguely defined markets.
