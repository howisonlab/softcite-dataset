            "text": "Background/Objectives: To assess the iron status among European adolescents through selected biochemical parameters in a cross-sectional study performed in 10 European cities. Subjects/Methods: Iron status was defined utilising biochemical indicators. Iron depletion was defined as low serum ferritin (SFo15 mg/l). Iron deficiency (ID) was defined as high-soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR48.5 mg/l) plus iron depletion. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) was defined as ID with haemoglobin (Hb) below the WHO cutoff for age and sex: 12.0 g/dl for girls and for boys aged 12.5-14.99 years and 13.0 g/dl for boys aged X15 years. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used as analytical method for SF, sTfR and C-reactive protein (CRP). Subjects with indication of inflammation (CRP 45 mg/l) were excluded from the analyses. A total of 940 adolescents aged 12.5-17.49 years (438 boys and 502 girls) were involved. Results: The percentage of iron depletion was 17.6%, significantly higher in girls (21.0%) compared with boys (13.8%). The overall percentage of ID and IDA was 4.7 and 1.3%, respectively, with no significant differences between boys and girls. A correlation was observed between log (SF) and Hb (r \u00bc 0.36, Po0.01), and between log (sTfR) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (r \u00bc \u00c00.30, Po0.01). Iron body stores were estimated on the basis of log (sTfR/SF). A higher percentage of negative values of body iron was recorded in girls (16.5%) with respect to boys (8.3%), and body iron values tended to increase with age in boys, whereas the values remained stable in girls. Conclusions: To ensure adequate iron stores, specific attention should be given to girls at European level to ensure that their dietary intake of iron is adequate.",

            "text": "Iron Deficiency (ID) continues to be one of the most prevalent nutritional deficiencies in the world, particularly in developing countries (World Health Organization (WHO), 2003). WHO estimated that ID occurs in about 66-80% of the world's population (WHO, 2003). ID has many negative effects on health, including changes in immune function, cognitive development, temperature regulation, energy metabolism and work performance (Dallman, 1986). On the other hand, iron is a pro-oxidant and thus a possible risk factor for coronary heart disease. However, a recent review suggests that there is no strong association between body iron stores and coronary heart disease in adults (Zegrean, 2009).",

            "text": "The diagnosis of ID is based primarily on laboratory measurements of biochemical iron indicators. There is no full international consensus on the indicators to be used for assessing iron status, as each indicator has its own limitations because of either poor sensitivity or specificity, or because it is modified by conditions other than ID (Dallman et al., 1993). There are three general approaches to assess ID in populations. In the first one, used in studies conducted by Hallberg et al. (Hallberg et al., 1993) and Amstrong (Amstrong, 1989), ID is defined as a low level of serum ferritin (SF). In the second one, used in the US in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II and III, the multiple-criteria model is used to classify ID; it consists of two or three abnormal values for transferrin saturation, SF and erythrocyte protoporphyrin (Cogswell et al., 2009). The main limitation of these two approaches is that inflammation leads to high ferritin values, even though iron stores are low. The third approach proposed by WHO (2004) and adopted by Zimmermann (2008) is based on the measurements of SF and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) in combination with C-reactive protein (CRP) to eliminate false negative cases in presence of inflammation. The third approach was considered more appropriate and was therefore used in the present study. It is well known that SF concentrations reflect the size of the iron stores (Cook, 1999) and that low SF levels identify 'iron depletion' (WHO, 2001). On the other hand, the measurement of sTfR has been reported to be useful in the diagnosis of 'tissue ID' (Skikne et al., 1990) and its values are not influenced by acute or chronic inflammatory conditions (Ferguson et al., 1992;Olivares et al., 1995). An approach to estimate body iron was developed by Cook et al. (Cook et al., 2003) using the formula: body iron (mg/kg) \u00bc \u00c0(log(sTfR/SF)\u00c02.8229)/ 0.1207 to allow the full range of the iron status of a population to be evaluated ,with negative values representing a deficit of iron with respect to the quantity required to maintain a normal haemoglobin (Hb) concentration.",

As a consequence, ID occurs in adolescents also in developed countries, if their additional iron needs are not met (Dallman et al., 1996).

The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of each country involved according to the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conferences on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the adolescents and the adolescents themselves (B\u00e9ghin et al., 2008). Briefly, subjects with an age range of 12.5-17.49 years were recruited in 10 cities across Europe. Selection of cities was based on two criteria: regional distribution and presence of an active research group assuring sufficient expertise and resources to successfully perform epidemiological studies. Within the study, Stockholm (Sweden) represented Northern Europe. Athens, Heraklion (Greece), Rome (Italy) and Zaragoza (Spain) represented Southern Europe. Pecs (Hungary) represented Eastern Europe. Ghent (Belgium) and Lille (France) represented Western Europe, whereas Dortmund (Germany) and Vienna (Austria) represented Central Europe. As the overall aim of the HELENA Study was to assess the nutritional status of the adolescent population in Europe, during the design phase, the variability of a large set of nutritional status indices obtained in previous studies was checked. Body mass index was the indicator that showed the largest variability. Therefore, the sample size was estimated according to the mean body mass index and variance values for each sex and age strata. This procedure ensured to adequately describe all the variables included in the study. For the sample size calculation, a confidence level of 95% and an error of \u00b1 0.3 kg/m 2 were assumed, leading to a sample size of 3000 adolescents. More details on the procedure are provided by Moreno et al. (2008).",

Whole-blood samples for the red blood parameters (Hb, red blood cell, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration and red cell distribution width) were sent directly to the local laboratory of each country to be analysed. Samples for iron status analyses were clotted at room temperature for at least 30 min, followed by centrifuged at 3500 r.p.m. for 10 min. Serum samples were shipped to the central laboratory in Bonn University (IEL, Germany), Department of Nutrition and Food Science, to be stored at \u00c080 1C before being shipped to Italy in May 2007, within 6 months of the collection. The aliquots of serum samples were analysed in the Human Nutrition Laboratory of the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN). SF, sTfR and CRP were measured by using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Erhardt et al., 2004). A commercially available control sample from Bio-Rad Liquichek Immunology Control Level 3 (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) was used to obtain a calibration curve on each plate.",

Both the prevalences observed in our study and in the US are below the cutoff established by WHO to determine 'no prevalence' of ID, that is, 10% (WHO, 2004). Both are   also far lower than that observed in other parts of the world as in Nepal, with an ID prevalence of 56% observed in adolescents girls (Woodruff et al., 2006). The slightly lower prevalence in our study may, in part, result from a different approach to define ID. The impact of ID on the cognitive functioning of adolescent girls who are at the highest risk of ID requires major clarification. In fact, there is only limited evidence that iron supplementation may improve attention, concentration and intelligent quotient (Falkingham et al., 2010). The prevalence of ID by geographical location was: 6% in both Northern Europe (Stockholm) and Southern Europe (11% in Athens, 6% in Heraklion, 3% in Rome and Zaragoza) plus Eastern Europe (Pecs), 5% in Central Europe (3% in Dortmund and 7% in Vienna) and 2% in Western Europe (no cases in Ghent and 4% in Lille).

The prevalence of IDA by geographical location was: 2% in Central Europe (2% in Dortmund and 3% in Vienna), 1% in both Northern Europe (Stockholm) and Southern Europe (no cases in Athens, 2% in Heraklion, 1% in both Rome and Zaragoza), 0.6% in Western Europe (no cases in Ghent and 1% in Lille) and no cases in Eastern Europe (Pecs). These data are similar to the estimates of prevalence in adolescents in Canada (Deegan et al., 2005), the United States (Looker et al., 2002) and Sweden (Samulson et al., 1996), ranging from 0 to 3%. In the present study, the proportion of anaemia was 4.4%, consistent with the estimates of the worldwide prevalence of anaemia during adolescence: 27% in developing countries and 6% in developed countries (Kara et al., 2006). The observed prevalence of anaemia not due to ID (3.1%) is probably overestimated because of unavoidable misclassifications that are inherent to the definition of limits. In fact, the limits set to define anaemia are based on 95% reference ranges, and therefore it is assumed that 2.5% of healthy individuals would be classified as anaemic. On the other hand, a proportion of anaemia without ID may be originated from genetic Hb disorders, as subjects with such disorders were not excluded. In our study, the highest prevalence of anaemia without ID among cities was observed in two cities of Greece (7.6% in Heraklion and 6.3% in Athens). Greece is known to be heavily affected by haemoglobinopathies (thalassaemia and sickle-cell disease). In fact, according to Angastiniotis et al. (1995), the highest percentage of carriers of thalassaemia and sickle-cell disorders is observed in Greece (9.0%).",

SF and sTfR that were chosen in this study as iron indicators showed a correlation with red cell parameters. The observed correlation coefficients between log(sTfR) and red cell parameters (MCV and MCH) are not surprising, as sTfR is a measure of ID erytropoiesis (Metzgeroth et al., 2005) as MCV and MCH. The present data are in general agreement with the result of a previous study showing a correlation between sTfR and red cell parameters in iron-deficient adolescents (Choi, 2003). These findings are confirmed, as the concentrations of the mean of red cell parameters decreased gradually (except for red cell distribution width that increased) with increasingly negative iron balance, as ID appeared (sTfR 48.5 mg/l) ( Table 5). The results of the present study document a positive correlation between log(SF) level and Hb concentration (r \u00bc 0.39, Po0.01; Table 3) comparable to those observed in other studies among children: r \u00bc 0.24 (Jeremiah et al., 2007) and r \u00bc 0.26 (Ayoya et al., 2010). The low correlation between these two indicators is because of the fact that they are related to differing stages of ID. The correlation between the indicators of iron status and red cell parameters may be considered as a confirmation of the reliability of these indicators (WHO, 2004;Zimmermann, 2008) in the assessment of iron status in adolescents.",

If iron depletion is not corrected, it may indeed progress to ID. In addition, the calculated measure of body iron was lower in girls than in boys. The distribution of body iron stores by age ( Figure 2) suggests that in boys, body iron stores may have slightly increased during and after their rapid growth period, whereas in girls, iron stores remain low during the whole pubertal period. One possible explanation for the lower iron status in girls, besides growth, is the loss of iron with menstruation. In previous studies, it was observed that the growth spurt associated with menstrual status, blood loss and a low iron intake may have adverse effects on iron stores in adolescents girls (Ilich-Ernst et al., 1998).",

On the basis of WHO guidelines (2004) for the interpretation of the iron status data at population level, the results indicate that, in the European context, ID is not prevalent neither in boys nor in girls, and that iron depletion is prevalent in girls but not in boys. Adolescent girls therefore constitute a group at risk of ID, and specific attention should be given to them during adolescence to ensure that their dietary intake of iron is adequate to their requirements.",
