They may involve only the anterior or anteroinferior portion, as seen in a Bankart and anterior labral periosteal sleeve avulsion (ALPSA) lesions, the posteroinferior area (Kim's lesion), or the superior labrum from anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions. SLAP lesions were first classified by Snyder et al. 1) into 4 subtypes. However, more extensive labral tears do occur, some of which may be progression of pre-existing SLAP lesions, or its combination with a Bankart lesion (SLAP type V). 2,3) A Bankart lesion is the primary pathology in posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability 4) and is present in over 90% of traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation. 5,6) A concomitant SLAP lesion occurs in up to 22% of anterior instabilities, 1,7) the presence of which greatly increases shoulder instability. 8-10) As such, it has been suggested that more extensive lesions are a result of an increased number"

[3][4][5]11) However, this is not always true since extensive lesions have been noted with a low number of dislocations in the presence of a high-energy trauma. 12,13) As such, other authors believe that reattachment of the concomitant SLAP lesion depends on the age and functional demands of the patient, noting that biceps tenodesis or tenotomy had varied results. Most studies claim that there is no significant difference in the range of motion (ROM), functional scores, and recurrence rates when compared to patients who underwent Bankart repair alone; 8,[14][15][16] however, a number of authors have noted several limitations of ROM, especially in external rotation, among those who underwent the combined procedure. 8,17) To investigate these problems further, the authors compared the clinical characteristics of patients who had anterior shoulder instability with and without SLAP lesion. In addition, we analyzed the effect of concomitant SLAP repair on surgical outcome after arthroscopic stabilization of anterior instability. We hypothesized that anterior shoulder instability with SLAP lesion would be related to high-energy trauma or more episodes of dislocation compared to shoulder instability without SLAP lesion, and that shoulder ROM will decrease after combined arthroscopic anterior capsulolabral reconstruction and SLAP repair, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes.",

Involvement of the dominant arm was similar in both groups, as were the degree of sports and participation in overhead sports. On the whole, patients in group I suffered more pain, had more difficulties in performing daily activities, perceived a more unstable shoulder, and were more dissatisfied with their shoulder condition, as evidenced by higher pain VAS (p = 0.02) and lower Rowe (p = 0.04) scores preoperatively.

Kim et al. 13) reported that 68.7% of patients with fewer than five dislocations had extensive circumferential labral lesions. Likewise, radiologic evaluation of shoulder dislocation patients showed superior labral involvement in 39% of patients with a single episode. 12) In the current study, we observed that patients with a combined anterior instability and detached SLAP lesion had significantly higher incidence of high-energy trauma (p = 0.03) and fewer episodes of dislocation (p = 0.15). This suggests that the severity of the lesions may not be secondary to progression of a simple injury; rather, it was a result of the initial trauma. As such, this supports our hypothesis that anterior shoulder instability with SLAP lesion is related to high-energy trauma.",

            "text": "Preoperative pain VAS and Rowe scores were significantly worse in patients with SLAP lesions, despite having fewer dislocation episodes. The current findings are in accordance with those of Kim et al. 13) who reported that patients with more severe labral lesions had worse preoperative pain VAS and functional scores and consulted sooner than those with only a Bankart or ALPSA lesion, most likely because of the more severe pain and limitation of activity of daily living. Postoperatively, their patients had similarly improved ROM and shoulder scores, despite the degree of injury and extent of repair. These are consistent with previous reports that the functional outcomes of patients with combined lesions are not dependent on concomitant SLAP repair. 15) Therefore, we ascertain that SLAP repair combined with an anterior stabilization procedure does not lead to poor functional outcomes if appropriate surgical procedures and methodical postoperative rehabilitation are performed.",

            "text": "The objective of surgical management is to provide adequate joint stability, pain relief, and shoulder ROM comparable to the preinjury level so that the patient may return to his or her preinjury status. The basic tenet in the treatment of anterior shoulder instability is to recognize that surrounding structures, aside from the Bankart lesion, contribute to the pathology. Fixation of both the Bankart lesion and symptomatic SLAP lesion has been advocated by some authors, since fixation of only one would still result in residual instability in some cases. 3,11,21) A biomechanical study of SLAP repair showed that, when all other structures in the joint are intact, a SLAP repair alone helps to normalize the glenohumeral translation. However, when there was an additional pathology, the repair was rendered ineffective. 22) Another cadaveric study by Mihata et al. 10) investigated the effect of combined type II SLAP lesions with anterior capsular laxity, as would be seen in throwing athletes. They noted increased external rotation and anterior glenohumeral translation after simulation of anterior capsular laxity and type II SLAP lesion. After arthroscopic repair of the SLAP lesion alone, there was a significant decrease in the external rotation; however, this did not fully restore anterior glenohumeral translation. 10) As such, most authors would recommend fixation of both lesions to restore primary shoulder stability, which is essential to allow postoperative rehabilitation, while preventing residual laxity. Furthermore, repair of the SLAP lesion, especially in younger and more active patients, promoted return to overhead sports, and good outcomes can be achieved with appropriate treatment. 16,23) However, concerns regarding limitation of shoulder motion secondary to over-tightening of the capsulolabral complex or over-treatment have been raised. Postoperative decrease in shoulder ROM may be expected in most procedures and a decrease specifically in external rotation has been noted to occur, especially after combined anterior shoulder stabilization and SLAP repair. 14,18) Although recovery of shoulder ROM may be slower in this subset of patients, no difference was noted in the final ROM after 1 year. In the current study, the surgical technique for anterior capsulolabral reconstruction was identical in both groups. For the concurrent SLAP repair, we repaired between the 10-to 12-o' clock positions on a right shoulder and avoided anterior labral and capsular plication at the 12-to 2-o' clock positions. This fixation was firm and stable, and at the same time, provided some slack to the biceps anchor to maintain some external rotation. After fixation of SLAP lesions, authors always also release the superior and posterosuperior capsule. As such, we did not observe a significant decrease in external rotation in our patients with combined labral lesions. While there was indeed a decrease in the ROM at final follow-up, this was not different from the final ROM of the patients without SLAP lesions. Therefore, care should be taken during the surgery to preserve postoperative external rotation.",

First, the natural history of untreated asymptomatic SLAP lesions and their possible effect on the patient outcomes is unclear. Patients with anterior shoulder instability with asymptomatic detached SLAP lesions and those who underwent biceps tenodesis with anterior stabilization procedures instead of SLAP fixation should also be evaluated. Second, high-energy trauma is a somewhat vague and subjective experience. However, we confined high-energy trauma if shoulders were dislocated after a forceful traumatic event, such as vehicle accident, fall with outstretched hand and so on. Third, the number of subjects was limited and the length of follow-up in this retrospective study was relatively short. Also, the high rate of patients lost to follow up could pose a risk of type I error. A prospective study with mid-term follow-up would facilitate determination of differences in patient performance and return to sports between the 2 groups."
