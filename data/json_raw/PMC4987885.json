In comparison to our previous version, SL2 benefits from both a considerably enlarged database of fragments derived from high-resolution 3D protein structures of globular and helical membrane proteins, and the integration of a new protein viewer. The database, now with double the content, significantly improved the coverage of fragment conformations and prediction quality. The employment of the NGL viewer for visualization of the protein under investigation and interactive selection of appropriate loops makes SL2 independent of third-party plug-ins and additional installations.",

However, in more than one half of all entries deposited in the RSCB PDB segments are missing (2). These missing segments are often located in flexible and functionally important regions of proteins such as loops or turns, not resolved by X-ray crystallography or single particle cryo-electron microscopy. These regions have to be modeled to obtain a more complete structural model for further analysis of the structure, e.g. for molecular dynamics simulations (3).",

A prominent example are G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which constitute the largest protein family in the human genome. The number of available templates for modeling of GPCRs has increased dramatically in the last decade facilitating the generation of homology models for structure-based drug design. The common topology of the transmembrane-spanning regions, even of distantly related GPCRs, allows homology modeling of these regions and docking of small rigid orthosteric ligands with close to experimental accuracy. However, predictions of long or flexible loops remain unsolved problems, as evaluated recently by the community-wide GPCR Dock assessment (4). As the sequence similarity within loop regions is generally much lower than within other parts of proteins, specialized methods are required for modeling.",

Ab initio based methods utilize molecular mechanics force fields to determine possible loop conformations. These methods are generally CPU-intensive but capable of predicting currently unknown loop conformations. Fragment-based methods on the other hand are less CPUintensive and thus faster, but depend on known structures and precalculated fragment databases to find loop conformations. It remains unclear which method provides the better predictions. Some studies find that both methods perform on a similar level (9,12), while others describe advantages to either ab initio (15) or fragment-based (16) methods. As fragment-based methods generally provide results much faster, they are well suited for web-based tools such as Su-perLooper (17), allowing instant visualization and control of the results.",

Depending on the method used, also the prediction of shorter loops might benefit from a larger pool of available templates, e.g. when the exact fit of the stem atoms of the template loop to the gap is an evalua-tion criterion.

As a result, the loops stored in LIMP doubled from 179 580 to 378 839. For LIMP is composed mainly of loop structures, the length distribution differs from LIP where the fragments also include helical fragments and fragments derived from \u2424-sheets. In LIMP ( Figure 2B), few loop templates are available for short loops of 3-5 amino acids in length. The number of loops stored in LIMP increases markedly to a maximum of 20 000 up to a length of 20 residues before it decreases again.",

Fragments with appropriate sequence length, and with geometrical fingerprints of the fragment and the gap matching with an accuracy of at least 0.75\u00c5 RMSD distance are selected. This RMSD value is subsequently used to determine the top 1000 loop candidates. These loop candidates are then rescored by the parameters 'sequence similarity between missing segment and template loop' and 'fingerprint matching of the template loop to the gap in the model.' Only one representative of fragments with identical primary structure and high tertiary structure similarity (with backbone RMSD < 0.5\u00c5) is kept in the results list to maximize the conformational space of fragments used for further calculations. The top 100 loop candidates are finally displayed in the results list. Suitable candidates can be selected from that list by visual inspection.",

As a result of the enlarged fragment database the prediction quality has been further improved. Using the same dataset (15) and validation procedure as in our previous publication (17), an average gain in prediction quality by 20% is observed for loops of 3-16 residues length (Figure 4). A drop of the backbone RMSD between experimentally determined and modeled loops (only the top hit was considered) starts to become evident for loops with eight residues length. This implies that the coverage of possible loop conformations has been further optimized starting with this length.",

There are several  possible reasons for this. First, many loops are highly flexible or are even located in structurally disordered regions of proteins (26,27). The conformations suggested by SL2 may thus indicate alternative loop conformations not observed by protein X-ray structure crystallography (e.g. Figure S6 in (28)). Second, as scoring of the loops mainly depends on the stem residues, experimentally caused distortions of these stem atoms may prevent selection of a specific conformation (29). Prediction quality drops with loop length, mainly due to the increased conformational space. A promising strategy to enhance prediction quality of longer loops would be in-clusion of additional experimental constraints such as mass spectrometry (30,31) or electron density maps from single particle cryo-electron microscopy (32).
