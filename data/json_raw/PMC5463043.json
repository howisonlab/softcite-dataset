            "text": "Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) is a retrotransposon that contains a CpG island in its 5\uf0a2-untranslated region. The CpG island of LINE-1 is often heavily methylated in normal somatic cells, which is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. DNA methylation can differ between formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and frozen tissues. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the LINE-1 methylation status between the two tissue-storage conditions in gastric cancer (GC) clinical samples and to evaluate whether LINE-1 can be used as an independent prognostic marker for each tissue-storage type. We analyzed four CpG sites of LINE-1 and examined the methylation levels at these sites in 25 FFPE and 41 frozen GC tissues by quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing. The LINE-1 methylation status was significantly different between the FFPE and frozen GC tissues (p < 0.001). We further analyzed the clinicopathological features in the two groups separately. In the frozen GC tissues, LINE-1 was significantly hypomethylated in GC tissues compared to their corresponding normal gastric mucosa tissues (p < 0.001), and its methylation status was associated with gender, differentiation state, and lymphatic and venous invasion of GC. In the FFPE GC tissues, the methylation levels of LINE-1 differed according to tumor location and venous invasion of GC. In conclusion, LINE-1 can be used as a useful methylation marker for venous invasion in both FFPE and frozen tumor tissues of GC."

            "text": "Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) constitutes ~17% of the human genome (Lander et al., 2001). LINE-1 functions as a retrotransposon across its two open reading frames-ORF1p and ORF2p-and causes somatic retrotransposition, transcriptome effects, and DNA damage (Rodic and Burns, 2013). Thus far, many studies have proposed that the LINE-1 methylation status is associated with variant features in several cancer types. The hypomethylation of LINE-1, specifically, is associated with tumor progression, Molecules and Cells cancer risk, and poor prognosis in colon cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, and gastric cancer (GC) (Cash et al., 2012;Shigaki et al., 2013;Sunami et al., 2011;van Hoesel et al., 2012). LINE-1 is known to be hypomethylated in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues (Chalitchagorn et al., 2004). Previous studies reported that global LINE-1 hypomethylation was correlated with microsatellite instability and poor overall survival in colorectal cancer (Estecio et al., 2007;Ogino et al., 2008a;2008b). In addition, LINE-1 hypomethylation promotes liver metastasis by inducing expression of proto-oncogenes such as MET, RAB3IP, and CHRM 3 in colorectal cancer (Hur et al., 2014).",

The methylation status of LINE-1 differs between low-grade gastric dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and intramucosal cancer, and LINE-1 hypomethylation may be a diagnostic marker for high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal cancer (Lee et al., 2011). A previous study reported an association between LINE-1 hypomethylation and prognosis in gastric carcinogenesis (Shigaki et al., 2013). Moreover, the methylation status of LINE-1 changes when intestinal metaplasia progresses to gastric adenoma and is associated with poor prognosis in patients with GC (Bae et al., 2012). Thus, LINE-1 has been studied as an epigenetic marker associated with the risk for GC using blood or tissue samples. A meta-analysis of the LINE-1 methylation status in human cancers showed that LINE-1 is significantly hypomethylated as compared to controls in tissue samples such as fresh/frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, but not in blood samples (Barchitta et al., 2014).",

Although rarely observed, several patients have relatively high number of LN metastasis regardless of the depth of tumor invasion (T stage). While determining biomarkers for aggressive LN metastasis in GC, a previous study revealed that overexpressed plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a promising marker for aggressive LN metastasis with low T stage (Suh et al., 2015). Furthermore, GCRG213p, a variant of LINE-1 endonuclease, is overexpressed in both primary GC and LN metastasis (Wang et al., 2013). Previously, LINE-1 methylation was analyzed at specific combined CpG sites using 434 FFPE tissues, to investigate associations with clinicopathological features, including lymphatic and venous invasion, and considering the tissuestorage conditions, LINE-1 was reportedly more hypermethylated in FFPE tissues than in paired fresh-frozen tissues in GC (Song et al., 2016).",

Although LINE-1 was significantly hypomethylated in GC irrespective of both the differentiation and lymphatic invasion statuses, it was more hypomethylated in differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma and in GC showing lymphatic invasion (Figs. 2C and 2D). Therefore, we believe that frozen GC tissues have a different LINE-1 methylation status in each differentiation and lymphatic invasion state and that LINE-1 hypomethylation is especially associated with the male gender, differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma, and the presence of lymphatic invasion.",

However, we found no significant differences in the LINE-1 methylation levels between T3/4N0 and T1N3 (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we examined whether LINE-1 methylation in the FFPE tissues was associated with clinicopathological characteristics. We divided the patients into three groups according to tumor location (i.e., upper, middle, or lower third of the stomach), and on average, LINE-1 was significantly hypomethylated in tumors located in the lower third region compared to those in the middle third region (Fig. 3B). When we analyzed LINE-1 methylation patterns in each CpG site, the differences of LINE-1 methylation levels were also shown in several other characteristics (Table 2). On classifying patients into two groups according to the average age, only CpG1 of LINE-1 was significantly hypomethylated in patients older than 57 years. When tumor location was considered, only CpG1 and CpG2 were significantly different between tumors located in the middle and lower third regions (p = 0.002 and p = 0.008, respectively). In particular, LINE-1 methylation at CpG1 showed a significant difference according to the tumor location.

The results from this analysis were consistent with our findings from all CpG sites (data not shown), and combined two CpG sites was also a predictive factor of venous invasion ( Supplementary Fig. S3).

Bisulfite conversion can be affected by formalin fixation, as sequence artifacts such as cytosine deamination can be caused by formaldehyde (Do and Dobrovic, 2015). Therefore, we screened the LINE-1 methylation patterns in each tissue type separately to determine whether LINE-1 can be used as a marker under all circumstances. In the current study, we used samples from different patient groups, and different methylation levels were also observed between the two tissue types (Fig. 1A). Moreover, when we compared the LINE-1 methylation level in frozen GC tissues and paired adjacent NM, LINE-1 was significantly hypomethylated in GC tissue compared to NM ( Fig. 2A), consistent with the findings of previous studies (Bae et al., 2012;Shigaki et al., 2013).",

For LINE-1 methylation analysis, diverse assays, such as pyrosequencing, combined bisulfite restriction analysis, or MethyLight, have been used to measure methylation changes in samples from patients with cancer. However, among them, pyrosequencing is the most useful technique to detect LINE-1 methylation because it provides accurate and reliable results (Aparicio et al., 2009;Baba et al., 2014;Irahara et al., 2010).

Moreover, LINE-1 methylation at specific CpG sites was a prognostic marker in FFPE tissues obtained from 434 patients with advanced GC (Song et al., 2016). Likewise, several studies have evaluated LINE-1 methylation in GC, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the association between LINE-1 methylation level and clinicopathological parameters in both frozen and FFPE sample types in GC. The current study had two main aims. The first was to determine the relationship between LINE-1 methylation and clinicopathological features using frozen tissues, and several features were associated with LINE-1 methylation change. The second aim was to analyze the relationship between LINE-1 methylation and aggressive LN metastasis using FFPE tissues, because we only obtained FFPE tissues from patients diagnosed with early GC (T1) with high LN metastasis (N3). However, we did not find any significant difference in LINE-1 methylation between T3/4N0 and T1N3 (Fig. 3A).",

            "text": "In other cancers, LINE-1 methylation was associated with venous invasion in various samples such as serum or frozen tissue (Ikeda et al., 2013;Tangkijvanich et al., 2007). In GC, vascular invasion can increase angiogenesis and distant metastasis including lymph node metastasis (Maehara et al., 2000). After curative resection, LINE-1 methylation is even associated with recurrence and poor survival in GC, even though patients do not have metastasis (Li et al., 2015). Accordingly, finding biomarkers for venous invasion can be a powerful tool to predict invasive potential and prognosis. Because LINE-1 methylation has been known to be associated with venous invasion in GC FFPE tissues, we additionally used frozen tissues to clarify whether LINE-1 could also be a biomarker for venous invasion in other sample types. LINE-1 hypomethylation was detected in the presence of venous invasion in both FFPE and frozen tissues (Fig. 4). Further study using blood samples is needed to investigate whether LINE-1 methylation can be a non-invasive marker in GC.",

First, we used FFPE GC tissues according to specific T and N stages without paired normal tissues to analyze the relationship between LINE-1 methylation and T1N3 GC. Therefore, we could not compare the LINE-1 methylation levels in both normal and GC tissues. Second, the sample size was relatively small. Although a significant difference in the LINE-1 methylation level was correlated with venous invasion in FFPE and frozen tissues, only few cases of venous invasion were analyzed. In further studies, a larger sample size should be included to increase the reliability and acquire statistically significant data. In particular, validation studies using larger sample sizes irrespective of the T or N stages should be conducted."

In frozen tissues, the LINE-1 methylation was associated with gender, differentiation state, and lymphatic and venous invasion. In FFPE tissues, the LINE-1 methylation levels significantly differed according to tumor location and venous invasion. Therefore, LINE-1 can be a useful marker for several clinical factors in each tissue-storage type and could be a biomarker for venous invasion in both frozen and FFPE GC tissues."
