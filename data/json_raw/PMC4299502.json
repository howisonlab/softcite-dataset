Here we describe the establishment of neuroblastoma patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) by orthotopic implantation of viably cryopreserved or fresh tumour explants of patients with high risk neuroblastoma into immunodeficient mice. In vivo tumour growth was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Neuroblastoma PDXs retained the undifferentiated histology and proliferative capacity of their corresponding patient tumours. The PDXs expressed neuroblastoma markers neural cell adhesion molecule, chromogranin A, synaptophysin and tyrosine hydroxylase. Whole genome genotyping array analyses demonstrated that PDXs retained patient-specific chromosomal aberrations such as MYCN amplification, deletion of 1p and gain of chromosome 17q. Thus, neuroblastoma PDXs recapitulate the hallmarks of highrisk neuroblastoma in patients. PDX-derived cells were cultured in serum-free medium where they formed free-floating neurospheres, expressed neuroblastoma gene markers MYCN, CHGA, TH, SYP and NPY, and retained tumour-initiating and metastatic capacity in vivo. PDXs showed much higher degree of infiltrative growth and distant metastasis as compared to neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)c cell line-derived orthotopic tumours. Importantly, the PDXs presented with bone marrow involvement, a clinical feature of aggressive neuroblastoma. Thus, neuroblastoma PDXs serve as clinically relevant models for studying and targeting highrisk metastatic neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is a solid childhood tumour, which accounts for 15% of paediatric cancer deaths. The neuroblastoma cellof-origin is thought to derive from the sympathoadrenal lineage of the neural crest and the primary tumour frequently arises in the adrenal gland, although it can develop at any site of the sympathetic nervous system. Patients with Stage IV tumours display infiltrative growth and metastasis to distant sites such as bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver and lungs. Patients over 18 months of age with metastatic disease or MYCN amplification have a poor prognosis despite"

            "text": "In current human neuroblastoma xenograft mouse models, tumours have been established subcutaneously and by orthotopic injection of cell lines or short-term cultured primary cells. [3][4][5][6][7][8][9] Orthotopically growing tumours are more prone to form vascularised xenografts with increased frequency of spontaneous distant metastasis as compared to subcutaneous tumours. 5 It has become increasingly clear that tumour cells cultured in vitro can develop aberrant and irreversible genetic and phenotypic changes not consistent with the properties of the original patient tumour. 10 In addition, as shown here and previously reported, 5,11 cell line-derived orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts often lack substantial spontaneous metastasis to bone marrow. Although results from cell line-derived studies have been valuable, generation of neuroblastoma patientderived xenografts (PDXs) by implantation of viable tumour explants from cancer patients is an alternative approach to better maintain patient-derived tumour cell features. 12 By implantation of intact patient tumour explants, including human tumour stroma, in vitro induced modifications are bypassed. PDXs have been established by subcutaneous implantation of patient-derived tumour explants from paediatric cancers, including neuroblastoma 13 and by implantation of neuroblastoma samples into human pluripotent stem cellderived experimental teratomas. 14 By subcutaneous and/or orthotopic implantation of diverse adult tumours (reviewed in Tentler et al. 10 ), PDX-based tumour models have been increasingly utilised for preclinical drug screening. For this purpose and for mechanistic studies of metastasis and treatment resistance, it would be important to establish orthotopic PDX models of neuroblastoma to faithfully resemble the clinical features of the disease. Establishment of PDXs from rare tumours, like neuroblastoma, is however challenging for investigators with only sporadic access to fresh tumour material. We approached this problem by implantation of viably cryopreserved neuroblastoma samples.",

FDG signal was also seen in nontumour regions like brain, heart, kidneys and urinary bladder (Supporting information Fig. 1). For establishment of neuroblastoma PDXs, we implanted orthotopically fresh or viably cryopreserved tumour explants from six patient tumours into NSG mice. Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. Orthotopic PDXs from three patient tumours were established and detected by in vivo imaging. FDG-PET demonstrated heterogeneous uptake of FDG within tumours as seen from the sagittal, coronal and transversal views (Fig. 1a). Orthotopic neuroblastoma PDX growth was confirmed by MRI ( Fig. 1b).",

We show that it is possible to establish orthotopic neuroblastoma PDXs by implantation of fresh and, importantly, viably cryopreserved patient tumour samples, which overcomes the tissue shortageproblem when working with rare tumour forms. Using the clinical imaging modalities FDG-PET and MRI, we further show that orthotopic tumours within the abdominal cavity can be monitored. PDX tumours retained the clinical features of the disease such as the protein marker profile and prognostically significant chromosomal aberrations. Furthermore, PDXs were found to be robust models for invasive neuroblastoma with substantial metastatic spread to distant organs, including bone marrow. Lastly, we show that PDX-derived neuroblastoma cells can be established and passaged in vitro as spheres where they retained their proliferative capacity, neuroblastoma phenotype and tumour-initiating capacity in vivo."

Because tumours are established by implantation of explants we could not utilise imaging modalities that require pre-labelling of single cells for visualisation in vivo. However, as we show here, FDG-PET and MRI are powerful imaging techniques suitable for detection of orthotopic nonmodified neuroblastoma cells. While primary tumours were visualised in all tested tumourbearing mice, the next and more challenging step, will be to detect metastatic growth in the PDX models. A combination of FDG-PET or MIBG-SPECT, and MRI would probably optimise the conditions for detection of metastases in vivo.",

In the SK-N-BE(2)c cell model used here, several aberrant features not typical for the clinical disease were found, most importantly lack of bone marrow involvement. Indeed, one obstacle when studying neuroblastoma metastasis has been the scarcity of xenograft models that retain the metastatic pattern of the disease. 11 Here, we show that orthotopic neuroblastoma PDXs are reliable models for human neuroblastoma bone marrow metastasis. The presence of liver and lung metastasis in the PDX models are also consistent with the findings of liver and lung micrometastases in more than half of neuroblastoma patients analysed by immunohistochemistry postmortem. 19 Furthermore, we demonstrate that the neuroblastoma protein marker profile and neuroblastoma-associated chromosomal aberrations MYCN amplification, 1p deletion and gain of 17q were retained in PDXs.",

Implantation of viably cryopreserved tumour explants can solve this problem as demonstrated here. Cryopreservation of tumour explants further allows for storage of viable primary tumour material in biobanks and can be used for establishment of many diverse PDXs at any lab with animal facilities. This is in particular important for establishment of rare tumours like neuroblastoma. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that the in vivo take rate of cryopreserved and fresh tumour Cancer Cell Biology tissue (pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma) is comparable 20,21 , although a large divergence in tumour take rates between different tumour forms and within a given tumour form can be anticipated. In the case of neuroblastoma it is likely that the tumour take rate drastically drops if low-stage neuroblastomas were implanted. Other parameters that could influence successful in vivo engraftment include tissue viabil-ity, time from biopsy to implantation, tumour type, mouse strain, implantation site and the use of co-factors like Matrigel. However, given the scarcity of aggressive neuroblastoma we have not had the possibility to test the effect of all these parameters for engraftment.",

Although drug testing using subcutaneously implanted neuroblastoma xenografts 13 is less time-consuming, it appears, based on the results presented here and by others 5,10 that orthotopically established neuroblastoma PDXs is the model of choice for studying and targeting neuroblastoma invasion and metastasis in vivo. For such studies, neuroblastoma PDXs should optimally be used in conjunction with neuroblastoma transgenic mouse models with substantial metastatic capacity. 22,23 All established PDXs presented here contain MYCN amplifications and hence, the PDXs are also suitable models for targeting of MYCN in vivo. MYCN is an attractive therapeutic target for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma as MYCN amplification correlates with aggressive disease 24 and downregulation of MYCN expression results in decreased tumour cell proliferation, increased cell death and neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells in vitro. 25 In addition to orthotopic neuroblastoma PDX models, zebrafish and transgenic mouse models, driven by MYCN alone or in combination with other oncogenes 22,[26][27][28] are important complementary preclinical neuroblastoma models.",

Future work will need to expand the pool of neuroblastoma PDXs in order to reflect the large diversity of the disease. For instance up to now, we have only established tumours carrying MYCN amplifications. The PDXs serve as a source for in vivo expansion of patient-derived tumour-initiating cells, which will be valuable for in vitro studies. Furthermore, the recurrent findings of patient tumour-specific features, invasive growth and bone marrow metastasis in the PDX models demonstrate their suitability for mechanistic studies of human neuroblastoma growth and metastasis, and for drug testing against aggressive metastatic neuroblastoma in vivo."
