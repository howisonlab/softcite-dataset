            "text": "The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in mechanical energy due to continuous use of a plantar flexion resistive ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) of subjects with chronic hemiplegia. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 5 hemiplegic patients using AFOs without a plantar flexion resistive function in their daily lives. We analyzed the gait of the subjects using a 3D motion capture system under three conditions: patients' use of their own AFOs; after being fitted with a plantar flexion resistive AFO; and after continuous use of the device. The gait efficiency was determined by calculating the mutual exchange of kinetic and potential energy of the center of mass. [Results] An increased exchange rate of the kinetic and potential energy was found for all subjects. A larger increase of energy exchange was shown on the non-paralyzed side, and after continuous use of the plantar flexion resistive AFO. [Conclusion] We found that continuous use of a plantar flexion resistive AFO increased the rate of mutual exchange between kinetic energy and potential energy. The change in the rate was closely related to the role of the non-paretic side, showing that the subjects needed a certain amount of time to adapt to the plantar flexion resistive AFO.",

            "text": "Walking is an action with an extremely low energy cost. From the perspective of energy conversion of the center of mass (COM), the trajectory of the COM in the sagittal plane is similar to the motion of a pendulum, and this movement in known as the inverted pendulum model 1,2) . In this model, kinetic energy in the direction of progress reaches its peak at the time of heel strike, and gradually decreases in the first half of the stance phase as kinetic energy is converted to potential energy of the COM. The potential energy shows its peak at the midpoint of the stance phase. During the latter half of the stance phase, when the COM goes down, potential energy gradually decreases, as it is converted into kinetic energy. In order to achieve an efficient gait, energy conversion through the efficient use of gravity is important. This has been shown by passive walking robots 3) achieving ambulation with relatively low energy cost. Although the free gait speed of hemiplegic patients is less than half of that of healthy individuals, their oxygen consumption cost is about 25% larger 4) . The cause of the increased energy cost of hemiplegic gait is closely related to the increase of external work by the muscles involved in moving the COM 5) . Furthermore, it is thought that inefficiency in the energy conversion described above is one of the characteristics of hemiplegic gait 6) .",

To find this, gait data of more than one gait cycle was extracted, from the heel contact of the paralyzed limb to the foot contact of the ipsilateral limb, to have information about the highest and lowest positions of the COM. To calulate the kinetic energy and potential energy during ambulation, the kinetic energy (Ek.y) in the direction of progress of the body COM was calculated using Formula 1, the kinetic energy (Ek.z) in the vertical direction by Formula 2, the potential energy (Ep) by Formula 3, the total kinetic energy (Ek) by Formula 4, and the total energy (Etot) by Formula 5.",

Furthermore, the results suggest that the immediate effects at the time of first use of the PF-AFO were few, but many changes were found after its continuous use, indicating that time was necessary to learn to control the non-paretic side in order to adapt to the PF-AFO 11,12,24) .",
