This study was performed from September 2006 to August 2007 in Ardebil, Westnorthern Iran. The aim was to determine the prevalence of heart murmur in newborns and its correlation with CHD. Methods: In a 1-year cross sectional descriptive-analytic study, 2928 newborns were screened for heart murmur during routine neonatal physical examination. All babies with murmur underwent echocardiography. Findings: Murmur was detected in 91 (3.1%) neonates, of whom 47 (51.6%) had a congenital heart disease. The most common (17.6%) abnormality was ventricular septal defect. Patent ductus arteriosus was found in 10 (11%) patients. Conclusion: Remarkable high (round 50 %) rate of CDH in newborns presenting with heart murmur, urges to observe these neonates closely to establish the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and early referral to pediatric cardiologist.",
