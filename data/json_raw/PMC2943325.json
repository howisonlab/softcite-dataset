            "text": "A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in codon 129 of the human prion gene, leading to a change from methionine to valine at residue 129 of prion protein (PrP), has been shown to be a determinant in the susceptibility to prion disease. However, the molecular basis of this effect remains unexplained. In the current study, we determined crystal structures of prion segments having either Met or Val at residue 129. These 6-residue segments of PrP centered on residue 129 are \"steric zippers,\" pairs of interacting \u2424-sheets. Both structures of these \"homozygous steric zippers\" reveal direct intermolecular interactions between Met or Val in one sheet and the identical residue in the mating sheet. These two structures, plus a structure-based model of the heterozygous Met-Val steric zipper, suggest an explanation for the previously observed effects of this locus on prion disease susceptibility and progression.",

All these diseases involve the aggregation and deposition of the normally cellular and monomeric prion protein (PrP C ) into extracellular plaques. DNA sequencing of the human prion gene has shown that the SNP at codon 129 affects the susceptibility in all sporadic, genetic, and infectious cases of the disease (1). The frequency of this SNP is 38% in the European population, the lowest at 1% in the Japanese population, and the highest at 55% in the Fore people of Papua New Guinea (2). In Europeans, this SNP frequency translates to 39% of the population being homozygous for Met 129 (both alleles of the prion gene code for methionine at codon 129), 11% being homozygous for Val 129 , and 50% heterozygous.",

Aside from one recent exception, all known cases of new variant CJD (currently more than 200 individuals), which are believed to be acquired through ingesting beef from cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, have been Met 129 homozygous (3,4). Roughly 70% of individuals who developed CJD sporadically have been Met 129 homozygous, although cases of early onset (patients \u03fd49 years of age) are equally likely to be valine or methionine homozygous (5). A prevalence of homozygosity among individuals who developed iatrogenic CJD through exposure to tainted human growth hormone derived from cadavers further underscores that propagation of prion disease occurs more efficiently when an identical codon 129 is present in both alleles (6). On the basis of this SNP frequency, it has been proposed that heterozygosity may confer a level of resistance to prion disease (2).",

            "text": "Although the effect of the SNP at codon 129 on disease susceptibility is pronounced, the molecular basis of this phenomenon has been difficult to explain. Structures of the globular domain of monomeric PrP C (Fig. 1) show that residues 127-132 make up a short \u2424-strand (\u24241) involved in an antiparallel intramolecular \u2424-sheet (\u24241-\u24242) (7). The exposed nature of the \u24241 and the modulating effect of the Met/Val 129 polymorphism on susceptibility have stimulated hypotheses that this segment may serve as a nucleation site for the conformational transition of the monomeric PrP C into the aggregated pathogenic state (7). Indeed, intermolecular interactions involving \u24241 have been reported in crystal structures of both ovine and human PrP C showing the formation of an antiparallel \u24241-\u24241 sheet; however, these occur independently of the polymorphism (8,9). Careful studies of the stability, dynamics, and three-dimensional structures of PrP C found no appreciable differences resulting from Met 129 or Val 129 residues sufficient to explain the effects on disease phenotype (10,11). This suggests that the effects result from a property of the segment around residue 129 in the aggregated state of PrP.",

Both structures are \"steric zippers,\" the general class of structure we have previously found to be characteristic of aggregated amyloid and prion proteins (12)(13)(14). Steric zippers are fibril-like structures, consisting of a pair of \u2424-sheets. In general, the interfaces between the two sheets in steric zippers are devoid of water; instead they are self-complementary in shape with the side chains of the two sheets tightly abutting or interdigitating. The polymorphic methionine or valine side chains at residue 129 are each found at the dry interface between the \u2424-sheets. The differences we observe in these interfaces offer a hypothesis for why susceptibility to prion disease is greater in homozygous than in heterozygous individuals.",

We constructed such a model by superimposing one \u2424-strand of GYMLGS on a \u2424-strand of the experimentally determined steric zipper of GYVLGS. In this model, every possible rotamer of the methionine residue results in a steric clash with either the Ser 132 and Val 129 side chains or the main chain of the opposite \u2424-sheet (Fig. 2, d and g). Conversely, when GYVLGS \u2424-strands are superimposed onto \u2424-strands of the steric zipper interface of GYMLGS, large voids are found that would not permit efficient van der Waals packing of residues in the steric zipper interface (Fig. 2, e, f, h, and i). From the hypothetical models of mixed Met 129 /Val 129 interfaces, we infer that such \"heterozygous steric zippers\" are structurally disfavored for the PrP segment around residue 129, as compared with the \"homozygous steric zippers\" containing Met 129 and Val 129 . In short, the heterozygous steric zipper for the PrP segment in the vicinity of residue 129 appears less likely to form than the homozygous steric zippers.",

In yeast prions, steric zippers are also implied in the mechanism of non-Mendelian inheritance by the obligate conversion of prion to the amyloid state (26 -31). Prions in the amyloid state act as nuclei seeding the conversion to the amyloid state of the same protein from its soluble monomeric form. The amyloid state can then pass on to progeny cells. Progression and transmission of prion disease in mammals has been suggested to take place in a similar seeding of PrP C by PrP Sc (32)(33)(34).",

In this sense, structures of amyloid and prion fibrils are unlike those of globular and membrane proteins in which many segments of the protein contribute to the stability of the structure. This localization of structural determinants in amyloids is and f, models of GYVLGS strands into the steric zipper interface of GYMLGS, viewed down the fibril axis, illustrate that the valine side chains leave large voids within the steric zipper interface. Although the voids may not be evident from the space-filling representation of the interface, f shows a surface representation (in red) of the voids created by incorporating GYVLGS strands into the GYMLGS interface. g-i, these panels show the mixed GYVLGS/GYMLGS steric zipper models viewed perpendicular to their fiber axes. This offers another perspective of the interface between the antiparallel \u2424-sheets as well as the steric clash of a GYMLGS strand modeled onto GYVLGS interface and the voids created by GYVLGS strands modeled into the GYMLGS interface. why it is possible to predict protein segments that form fibrils (37), yet prediction of structures of globular and membrane proteins remains a great challenge. Furthermore, the structuredetermining segments of amyloids/prions can be crystallized, and their structures can be determined. In the work reported here, we focus on segment 127-132 of PrP, which forms a steric zipper and whose structure can be studied apart from the rest of the protein.",

Our models of heterozygous steric zippers suggest that a nucleus in individuals that are heterozygous at residue 129 would be less stable than either of the homozygous nuclei.

According to our hypothesis, the presence of prion protein with both Met 129 and Val 129 in heterozygous individuals would lessen the probability of a stable nucleus forming at this site because of the less favorable packing and would consequently lengthen incubation times.

            "text": "It is also possible that the longer incubation times in heterozygous individuals are due to nucleation of PrP Sc at segments other than around residue 129, albeit less efficiently. Amyloid formation can be nucleated by more than just one segment and can involve multiple segments of a protein. For example, Wiltzius et al. (14) found that various segments of the islet amyloid polypeptide form steric zippers and serve as nucleating sites leading to different \"strains\" of amyloid. Similarly, PrP Sc has been shown to have different strains, which have been attributed to different conformations of the protein in the aggregated state (41,42). The crystal structures of the 6-residue 127-132 segment presented here only represent a fraction of residues known to be in the core 90 -231 residues of infectious PrP Sc ; hence other segments must also be involved in the structure of amyloid from PrP and present possible alternative nucleation sites. Kinetic studies of amyloid formation by recombinant PrP with Met 129 , Val 129 , or a mixed population have not been consistent in recapitulating the same effects of the 129 polymorphism as seen in vivo, suggesting that in vitro, PrP amyloid may nucleate more efficiently along other interfaces (43)(44)(45)(46)(47). Consistent with this idea, we have found that PrP has multiple segments that form steric zippers. 3 Pathogenic mutations have been documented that work synergistically with the 129 polymorphism to cause prion disease. These underscore the idea that other segments of PrP are involved in forming steric zipper interactions in the structure of PrP Sc (48). Some of these mutations are distal to residue 129, such as P102L, D178N, E200K, and V210I, which have been found in multiple families affected by prion disease. These further support the involvement of intramolecular interactions between multiple steric zipper segments of PrP Sc , such as those between the segments containing the 129 polymorphism and those with the pathogenic mutation. Other pathogenic mutations are proximal to the polymorphic residue 129 such as G131V, which caused Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker syndrome in a patient who was homozygous for Met 129 (49). In the structures of the 127-132 segments, residue Gly 131 is stacked on Tyr 128 , which in the case of the pathogenic Val mutation would cause considerable steric clashes. The G131V pathogenic mutation would therefore cause a considerably different steric zipper packing, which as pathology suggests would nucleate amyloid assembly even more efficiently.",

The steric zipper interfaces are highlighted by showing interdigitated residues in spacefilling mode to emphasize the difference between the GYMLGS (Met 129 ) and GYVLGS (Val 129 ) segments and the efficient van der Waals packing of atoms in these interfaces. The carbon atoms in GYMLGS are colored in black, and in GYVLGS, they are in pink except when showing the side chains of Met 129 and Val 129 , which are colored in blue. Red atoms represent oxygen, and yellow represents sulfur. c, one \u2424-sheet of the GYMLGS viewed perpendicular to the fibril axis, which is parallel to the length of the page. Residues Gly 127 and Gly 131 are colored in black, residues Tyr 128 , Leu 130 , and Ser 132 are in white, and residue Met 129 is in blue. The antiparallel nature of the \u2424-sheets results in the alternating stacking of blue and white as well as black and white residues up and down the fibril axis. Both faces of the \u2424-sheets are equivalent. d, a model of one strand of GYMLGS onto the steric zipper interface of GYVLGS, viewed down the fibril axis illustrates that in such a heterozygous steric zipper, the methionine side chain would create steric clashes with the peptide backbone and the neighboring side chains. Steric clashes are represented by yellow stars. e",
