However, the mechanisms regulating sxy gene expression are not understood despite being key to understanding the physiological role of DNA uptake. We have isolated mutations in H. influenzae sxy that greatly elevate translation and thus cause competence to develop in otherwise noninducing conditions (hypercompetence). In vitro nuclease analysis confirmed the existence of an extensive secondary structure at the 5' end of sxy mRNA that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon in a stem-loop. All of the hypercompetence mutations reduced mRNA base pairing, and one was shown to cause a global destabilization that increased translational efficiency. Conversely, mutations engineered to add mRNA base pairs strengthened the secondary structure, resulting in reduced translational efficiency and greatly reduced competence for genetic transformation. Transfer of wild-type cells to starvation medium improved translational efficiency of sxy while independently triggering the sugar starvation regulator (CRP) to stimulate transcription at the sxy promoter. Thus, mRNA secondary structure is responsive to conditions where DNA uptake will be favorable, and transcription of sxy is simultaneously enhanced if CRP activation signals that energy supplies are limited.",

            "text": "Natural competence, the ability to take up DNA molecules directly from the environment, is tightly regulated in most bacteria, indicating that the costs and benefits of DNA uptake depend on changes in the extracellular and intracellular environments. Because the mechanisms regulating competence evolved to allow cells to track these changes, understanding the mechanisms provides a window on the importance of DNA uptake to the cell. Bacteria in the families Pasteurellaceae, Enterobacteraceae and Vibrionaceae appear to share a common regulatory mechanism, with competence genes organized in a regulon whose transcription is controlled by two activator proteins, Sxy (also known as TfoX) and CRP (also known as CAP) (1). Although competence genes are ubiquitous in these families, only a few species are known to be naturally competent, and the only wellstudied competence regulon is that of Haemophilus influenzae (Pasteurellaceae). H. influenzae becomes moderately competent as growth slows during late log phase in rich medium, and becomes maximally competent when log phase cells are transferred to the defined starvation medium MIV (2).",

Cells lacking sxy cannot induce the 25 genes (13 transcription units) of the competence regulon; many of these genes are known to contribute directly to DNA uptake (2). Conversely, overexpression of sxy from multi-copy plasmids induces competence under what are normally non-inducing conditions in H. influenzae, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Vibrio cholerae (4)(5)(6). Unlike Sxy, CRP is a global regulator. It activates a broad array of genes united by their roles in obtaining or utilizing alternative carbon or energy sources, or in sparing the wasteful use of the preferred sources; its action has been very well studied in Escherichia coli. When activated by its allosteric effector cyclic AMP (cAMP), CRP binds specifically to 22 bp sites in promoters where it stimulates transcription.

Here we report the isolation and characterization of additional hypercompetencecausing point mutations in sxy, none of which alter the protein sequence. We show that all the hypercompetence mutations act by increasing sxy expression, and that this effect arises by destabilization of an mRNA secondary structure that normally limits sxy translation in rich medium. In maximal competence-inducing conditions, CRP induces sxy; together CRP and Sxy then induce the genes of the CRP-S regulon.",

Wild-type cells growing at low cell density in rich medium do not express competence genes or take up DNA, so an EMSmutagenized culture was incubated with DNA carrying a novobiocin-resistance allele and Nov R transformants were selected. Screening of the rare transformants identified four additional strains with mutations that mapped to sxy; the alleles were named sxy-2, sxy-3, sxy-4 and sxy-5. As shown in Figure 1, all four mutants demonstrated the same 50-fold to 500-fold increased transformation frequencies as the sxy-1 mutant, during both log phase growth (A 600 0.2) and late-log phase growth (A 600 1.0).

This confirmed that all of the four new hypercompetence mutations increased competence without changing the sequence of Sxy or any other protein. We thus hypothesized that all five mutations acted by altering control of sxy expression rather than by changing Sxy function. As Sxy is an activator of competence genes, and as we observed elevated expression of all CRP-S regulon genes in microarray analysis of the sxy-1 mutant in rich medium (data not shown), we predicted that the mutations would cause hypercompetence by increasing rather than decreasing sxy expression.

Figure 2C graphs transformation frequencies as a function of Sxy protein levels for wildtype and mutant cells in the log and late-log phases of growth.

We first examined cleavage of wild-type sxy RNA by the structure-specific ribonucleases RNase T1 and RNase A, using a cloned sxy fragment extending from base 1 to base 323. RNase T1 cuts specifically at single-stranded Gs, while RNase A cuts single-stranded Cs and Us. Figure 3B shows the cleavage intensities of all scorable positions between positions 1 and 122, normalized to positions 78 and 80, which were consistently cleaved. (Data for some Cs and Us are not shown because they were not cut by RNase A even when the RNA was denatured.) The strong cleavages between positions 42 and 48, and between positions 72 and 80, confirm that Loops B and C form in vitro, and that they are separated by The nuclease-assay support for Stems 2 and 3 and Loops B and C suggests that the sxy SD site and start codon may by sequestered within a small loop and stem, respectively, likely preventing the initiation of translation. The biochemical evidence for Stem 1 is fairly strong, with most of the informative positions protected from cleavage. Importantly, of the sites of the five hypercompetence mutations, the three that are scorable in these assays are all strongly protected, supporting the hypothesis that they normally are paired.",

The test is especially clear here, as the sxy-1 and sxy-3 mutations make complementary substitutions disrupting the same proposed base pair. If both do increase sxy expression by destabilizing the secondary structure, then a double mutant carrying both substitutions will have base pairing restored and thus will have a more normal phenotype (lower competence) than either single mutant, rather than the more extreme phenotype expected if the mutations increase expression in some other way. The desired double mutant, sxy-6, was created by site-directed mutagenesis in E. coli, followed by transformation into the H. influenzae chromosome. This combined the sxy-1 and sxy-3 mutations to generate an A:U pair where wild-type sxy has a G:C pair ( Figure 3A). Figure 2B shows that sxy-6 cells produced wild-type levels of Sxy protein, much less than either parent mutant, confirming that the sxy-1 and sxy-3 mutations act by disrupting base pairing. The altered sequence but wild-type phenotype of the sxy-6 mutant is strong evidence that the single mutant phenotypes are not due to sequence-dependent interactions with a regulatory protein or RNA.",

Figure 4B plots mRNA abundance measured by quantitative PCR (upper panel), and the corresponding translational efficiencies (lower panel) calculated for wild-type cells and hypercompetent mutants from the protein levels in Figure 2B. Although hypercompetent mutants in early log produced 7-to 16-fold more protein than wild-type cells, they produced only slightly more mRNA, indicating that mutant translational efficiencies were elevated 3.5-to 6.5-fold. When wild-type cells entered late-log growth, the amount of sxy transcript and Sxy protein both doubled, so the translational efficiency did not change. However, when the hypercompetent mutants entered late log they showed an even greater disproportion between mRNA and protein than in early log, implying a greater increase in translational efficiency. Transfer of exponentially growing wild-type cells to MIV resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of sxy mRNA and a 9-fold increase in protein after 90 min, implying a 3.5-fold increase in translational efficiency. These results suggest that transfer to MIV maximizes competence in wild-type cells because it releases the translation limitation caused by mRNA secondary structure in rich medium.",

Figure 5B shows that inclusion of the oligonucleotide in reaction mixtures allowed wild-type mRNA to be translated as efficiently as sxy-1 mRNA, but had no significant effect on the translatability of sxy-1 or sxy-7 mRNA. These results suggest that, in vitro, secondary structure does not inhibit translation of sxy-1 mRNA. Conversely, the high stability of the sxy-7 mRNA secondary structure not only prevents translation but also prevents competition of Stem 1a by the complementary oligonucleotide.

Transcription was induced only slightly in a cyaA \u00c0 mutant. Adding 1 mM cAMP resulted in very strong induction of sxy, indicating that CRP does activate the sxy promoter. The promoter could be induced by cAMP added after 20 min in MIV, but the amount of sxy transcript still fell back to preinduction levels after 40 min in MIV. Thus, CRP is a strong inducer of sxy expression, but continuing expression appears to be overridden by a repressing mechanism after 40 min. This mechanism is unlikely to be autorepression of the crp gene by CRP, because sxy repression did not depend on when cAMP was added.",

Ribosomes require that a 35-50 nt segment including the SD site be free of stable secondary structure (21). Indeed, extensive regions of double-stranded RNA at or near the SD site and start codon, like the secondary structure we have detected in sxy mRNA, are known to preclude ribosome binding to (and consequently translation of) several bacterial mRNAs (22)(23)(24)(25). Under this model of sxy expression, the moderate increase in transcript abundance in the sxy83 transcriptional fusion strain ( Figure 4A) and in hypercompetent mutants ( Figure 4B) arises because mutant mRNAs are more often occupied by ribosomes and thus protected from degradation [see (26) for a recent review of ribosome protection], rather than because hypercompetence mutations activate the sxy promoter. Furthermore, use of a T7 promoter to generate sxy mRNA for in vitro translation confirmed that the hypercompetence phenotype can be explained primarily by improved translation efficiency and not by mutational effects on sxy's native promoter.",

Rather, it has the potential to play a sensory role that explains the repression of competence by purine nucleotides (27). In bacteria, multiple regulatory mechanisms link nucleotide availability to transcription initiation, promoter escape and elongation (28)(29)(30)(31)(32). For example, translation of E. coli's pyrimidine biosynthesis operon pyrBI is contingent on nucleotide starvation (33). When cells are starved for the pyrimidine nucleotide UTP, transcription pausing in the pyrBI leader sequence allows ribosome loading to prevent folding of an mRNA-terminating hairpin (34).",

First, large mRNA secondary structures require time to fold after their synthesis is complete, especially if the final structure involves pairing between non-adjacent segments as in Stem 1 of sxy mRNA (35). Translation thus may initiate more easily on newly synthesized transcripts than on ones that have had time to fold. Even so, the ability of an oligonucleotide to compete with the secondary structure of sxy, but not sxy-7 indicates that double-stranded regions of the wild-type transcript are sufficiently dynamic to allow invasion by more stable partners ( Figure 5B), suggesting that sxy mRNA secondary structure never completely precludes ribosome binding.",

Dynamic modeling of sxy mRNA folding using the RNA Kinetics server (http://www.ig-msk.ru/RNA/ kinetics/) predicted that the segment of sxy mRNA containing the SD site and the start codon will remain largely unstructured until more than 100 nt have been synthesized. The availability of this potential landing platform for ribosomes will in turn depend on the rate of transcription, thus making the progress of RNA polymerase a potential transducer of nutritional signals.",

Transfer to MIV causes abrupt depletion of nucleotide pools, and the resulting slowing of transcription may be sufficient to allow translation to initiate on most nascent wild-type transcripts. The combination of increased translation efficiency with the increased transcription caused by rising cAMP would then lead to a burst of Sxy production, followed by expression of competence genes.",

In addition, at least one essential competence gene has a candidate PurR-binding site in its promoter, and PurR repression of purine biosynthesis genes is relaxed in MIV (2).

The average and standard deviation of three independent time courses are shown. (B) Protein production in reactions containing a ssDNA oligonucleotide complementary to the 5 0 -end of sxy mRNA. The inset illustrates the oligonucleotide (black) binding to nucleotides 2-19 of the sxy transcript (gray), thus directly competing with formation of Stem 1a. The average and standard deviation of two independent time courses using WT and sxy-7 template, and one time course using sxy-1 template are shown. All Sxy protein levels are normalized to wild type at 10 min in (A).",
