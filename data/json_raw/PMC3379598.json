In the second-less-frequent health care use category (one to three times per year), uninsured were still more likely to fall into this category than insured (38.6 vs. 27%, respectively); on the contrary, in the ADArecommended category (four or more times per year), uninsured were less likely to fall into this category than insured (49.3 vs. 70.9%). They were more likely to report no routine place to go for health care (10.4 vs. 1.7%, P , 0.001). Furthermore, frequency of health care use was associated with diabetes control (Fig. 1).

In our unadjusted model, those who reported no place to go were less likely to control their A1C than those who used doctor offices or HMO facilities for their health care. However, this association was no longer significant in the multivariate model. Race/ethnicity has been found to be related to poor access to health care (26,27). In the U.S., Hispanics have been found to have significantly less access to health care than non-Hispanics (28)(29)(30). One study found that even though access to health care differed among Caucasians, African Americans, and Mexican Americans, the health status and outcomes for adults with type 2 diabetes did not significantly differ among these groups, and health status seemed not to be influenced by access to health care (31). Although our study also found that Hispanics had less access, we also demonstrated that the uninsured had worse glycemic control profiles than those who were insured. When we adjusted for race/ethnicity in our model, the results from the adjusted model remained almost the same as those from the unadjusted model, indicating that the association of access to health care with glycemic control was independent of race/ethnicity.
