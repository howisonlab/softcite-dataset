            "text": "The metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are critically involved in enabling the persistency of forms of synaptic plasticity that are believed to underlie hippocampus-dependent memory. These receptors and in particular, mGlu5, are also required for hippocampusdependent learning and memory. In the hippocampus, synaptic plasticity is one of the mechanisms by which spatial information may be represented. Another mechanism involves increased firing of place cells. Place cells increase their firing activity when an animal is in a specific spatial location. Inhibition of factors that are essential for synaptic plasticity, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors or protein synthesis, also impair place cell activity. This raises the question as to whether mGlu receptors, that are so important for synaptic plasticity and spatial memory, are also important for place cell encoding. We examined locationdependent place cell firing i.e. place fields. We observed that antagonism of mGlu5, using 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP) had no effect on place field profiles in a familiar environment. However, in a novel environment mGlu5-antagonism affected long-term place field stability, reduced place cell firing and spatial information. These data strongly suggest a role for mGlu5 in the mechanisms underlying informational content and long-term stability of place fields, and add to evidence supporting the importance of these receptors for hippocampal function.

Furthermore, induction of both persistent (>24 h) LTP (Manahan-Vaughan et al., 2003), and the acquisition of spatial memories (Riedel et al., 2000) leads to increased hippocampal expression of mGlu5. In addition, dendritic protein synthesis is triggered by mGlu5 (Huber et al., 2000(Huber et al., , 2001. This suggests that mGlu5 contributes to synaptic restructuring that upholds persistent information storage and bridges the gap between acute NMDA receptor activation and the triggering of downstream cascades necessary for protein synthesis (Mukherjee and Manahan-Vaughan, 2013).",

There are two main features of place cells that make them important in the spatial memory system. First, place cells tend to be stable by repeated exposure to the same environment. This kind of stability can last for days, weeks, or even months (Thompson and Best, 1990). Second, when an animal enters a new environment, the firing pattern of place cells changes in an unpredictable manner (known as remapping). Place cells may shift their firing rate, change their place field location or switch on or off. Once place fields are newly formed, they are preserved, and can be stable regardless of their activity or lack of it in another environment (Bostock et al., 1991;Wilson and McNaughton, 1993).",

Animals were anaesthetized with an initial dose of sodium pentobarbital (52 mg kg 21 , i.p.) and placed in a stereotactic unit. Body temperature was monitored throughout the operation and the anaesthetic dose was adjusted to maintain surgical anesthesia. A hole was drilled (1.2 mm diameter) over the right hippocampus. The tetrodes were placed in the cortex just above the CA1 hippocampal subfield (bregma 23.8 mm AP, 3.0 mm ML, and 1.5 mm DV). They were lowered into the CA1 cell layer in the screening phase after surgery, by turning the microdrive. So as to protect exposed part of tetrodes between the skull surface and the bottom of the cannula, a sleeve made of 19-gauge tubing was pulled down over the exposed tetrodes to a depth just below the skull surface, the top of which overlapped the cannula. Three holes were drilled in the frontal, parietal and occipital bone respectively, into which small jewelers' screws were inserted. The microdrive was then anchored to the jewelers' screws and the skull surface by dental acrylic (Paladur, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH). One of screws also served as the electrical ground. The wound was dusted with chlorhexidine antiseptic powder (Riemser, Germany). The animals were treated before and after surgery with an analgesic (Meloxicam, Vetmedca GmbH, Ingelheim, Germany). The animals were allowed at least 7 days to recover from surgery before screenings were conducted. During this period, they were monitored closely for infection or distress and handled regularly.",

The headstage was linked to a pre-amplifier via lightweight hearing-aid wires. The buffered signal from the headstage was amplified 6,000-30,000 times in the pre-amplifier and then digitized (48 kHz) and bandpass filtered (0.6-7 kHz) in the dacqUSB system unit (Axona, UK). Each tetrode could be recorded differentially being referenced by one electrode of another tetrode. One of the recording channels was dedicated to EEG recording. The position of the rat was monitored by a video camera mounted directly above the platform and converted into x-y coordinates by a tracking system which detected a small light mounted on the headstage near the rat's head.",

The clusters were isolated initially by hand. Complex spike cells with one or two firing fields were separated on the basis of spike shape, firing rate, and firing location. At least 50 spikes were isolated for each cluster. Once the cluster was isolated, a boundary of cluster was automatically generated by Tint software (Axona, UK). Then the same boundary was applied for cluster cutting in all other trials. After the cluster cutting, firing rate maps for each cell were visualized and smoothed using Tint, which divided the camera view arena into 64 3 64 square bins with a side length of 2.5 cm. The firing rate for a given cell in each bin indicated the spike number divided by dwell time in that bin. The firing rate maps were presented in color with a lowest firing rate (i.e., 0 Hz) in blue and the highest in red. Place field was defined as the contiguous group of pixels possessing a firing rate higher than half of the peak firing rate and covering <60% of the size of the recording arena. If a place cell was identified with one or more place fields, recordings were repeated two to three time on the same day and at least once more on the second day to verify its stability. If no qualified cell activity was identified, the tetrodes were advanced 25-50 mm and rats were returned to their home cages for at least 2 h. The maximum movement of tetrodes per day was 150 mm.",

The size of the place field was calculated as the percentage of the recording arena by the place field. The average firing rate was determined by dividing the number of spikes that occurred over the entire trial by the duration of the trial. The peak firing rate was determined as the highest firing rate of all pixels within the place field of the cell. Mean infield and outfield firing rates were defined as the mean values for the firing rates of all pixels within (infield) and outside (outfield) the place field. The spatial information content, measured in bits/spike, is a measure of how much information about the spatial location of the animal is contained within the activity of the cell. It was calculated using the methods described by Skaggs et al. (1993). Spatial coherence is a measure of the spatial contiguity of the neuron's activity. It determines the \"smoothness\" of place fields in firing ratemaps. It was calculated in steps described by Muller and Kubie (1989).",

This was to minimize the factor that place fields were less stable during the first minutes. In the following descriptions, the code \"D\" stands for the experimental day. The \"S\" stands for the \"square arena\" which is familiar to animals and \"R\" stands for the \"round arena,\" which is novel to animals. On Day 0, at least two place cells were identified (D0S1) and confirmed (D0S2) in the square familiar box. On Day 1, cells were confirmed again in the familiar box (D1S0). If their firing pattern on the spike clusters were not shifted from the ones from last trials, rats were injected i.p. with either vehicle or MPEP. If the spike clusters were shifted, experiment stopped and returned to D0S1. After the injection, rats were kept in their home cages for 30 min before D1S1 started. Trial D1S1 was to test whether injection of vehicle/MPEP affected place fields in the familiar environment which were already established. In trial D1R1, rats were placed into a novel circular box. The question for this trial was to ask whether MPEP affected the formation of place fields for the first time in a new environment. Trial D1S2 was used to test whether, after injection with MPEP, exposure to a novel environment disrupted place fields established in a familiar environment, i.e., in D1S1. These trials took a total time of about 1 h, after which rats were returned to their home cages and were kept there for 1 h. Trial D1R2 allowed us to find out if newly formed place fields in the novel environment were still stable after an interval of 2 h, and trial D1S3 provided both a check of cell stability in familiar environment and a baseline for day 2 recordings. On day 2, trial D2S1 allowed us to check again for place field stability in the familiar environment, and trial D2R1 allowed us to examine whether newly formed place fields were stable after a long interval of about 24 h. Trial D2S2 provided yet another check of stability, and trial D2R2 allowed us to see if the place fields in the novel environment were the same as in trial D2R1.

Activation of the receptor is necessary to enable persistent synaptic plasticity (Naie and Manahan-Vaughan, 2004;Popkirov and Manahan-Vaughan, 2011) whereby the NMDA receptor preferentially enables induction of plasticity to occur. Thus, at least for the CA1 region, the NMDA receptor enables the initial calcium influx required for the immediate change in synaptic strength that occurs followed patterned afferent stimulation (Dudek and Bear, 1992;Mulkey and Malenka, 1992;Manahan-Vaughan, 1997) and which enables plasticity to endure for several minutes, whereas activation of mGlu5 strengthens the synaptic response such that it endures for at least 4 h (Naie and Manahan-Vaughan, 2004;Popkirov and Manahan-Vaughan, 2011).

            "text": "MGlu5 mediates the prolongation of synaptic plasticity through a variety of mechanisms. As a group I mGlu receptor subtype, it is positively coupled to phospholipase C (Nakanishi et al., 1994;Pin and Duvoisin, 1995) and when activated, enables that calcium is released from intracellular stores. The receptor can also facilitate calcium entry through NMDA receptors (Mannaioni et al., 2001) and activates somatic calcium transients, thus affecting frequency accommodation in hippocampal synapses (Niswender and Conn, 2010). MGlu5 also enables neuronal oscillations in the hippocampus that are presumably the vehicle for neuronal information transfer across this structure (Bikbaev et al., 2008), and is intrinsically involved in the induction and maintenance phases of both persistent LTP (Balschun and Wetzel, 2002;Naie and Manahan-Vaughan, 2004;Manahan-Vaughan and Braunewell, 2005;FIGURE 7. Spatial information contents and spatial coherence were impaired in the MPEP group. Spatial information contents (A) and spatial coherence (B) of place fields in the familiar and novel environment are illustrated. Spatial information in the control and MPEP group was equally high in the familiar environ-ment. But in the novel environment, spatial information was lower in the MPEP group. Spatial coherence in the MPEP group was significantly decreased in the familiar environment but only showed a non-significant decrease in the novel environment (ANOVA, *: P < 0.05). Bar chart shows mean value 6 SEM.  Neyman and Manahan-Vaughan, 2008) and LTD (Neyman and Manahan-Vaughan, 2008). Prolonged mGluR5 blockade leads to a decrease of both theta and gamma power in the dentate gyrus (Bikbaev et al., 2008) and activation of mGlu5 increases excitability in layer V pyramidal neurons (Sourdet et al., 2003). Both findings suggest that mGlu5 might be essential in the precise temporal encoding required for spatial memory. Changes in neuronal oscillations mediated by mGlu5 antagonism could thus have affected place cell stability by reducing available information content. In line with this, mGlu5 is essential for many forms of hippocampus-dependent learning including inhibitory avoidance learning (Simonyi et al., 2007), spatial alternation (Riedel et al., 1999;Balschun et al., 2002), spatial context (object-place) learning (Popkirov and Manahan-Vaughan, 2011), spatial working and reference memory (Naie and Manahan-Vaughan, 2004), object recognition memory (Barker et al., 2006), spatial learning in a water maze (Richter-Levin et al., 1994;Bordi et al., 1996). Alterations in mGlu5 function and/or expression are also a major factor in fragile-X mental retardation (Giuffrida et al., 2005;Fatemi et al., 2011). In light of the substantial body of evidence supporting an intrinsic role for mGlu5 in hippocampus-dependent learning and synaptic plasticity, it is perhaps not all that surprising that we identified a role for mGlu5 in place cell encoding. A not too delicate interplay between place cell encoding and LTP has been described, whereby afferent stimulation to the hippocampus to induce LTP obliterates place fields and facilitate remapping (Dragoi et al., 2003) The exact nature of the relationship between LTP and place cell encoding is unclear, but it may be that LTP serves under certain circumstances to generate a tabula rasa after which new information may be stored in the hippocampus, or that it identifies and selects synapses that engage in information encoding of a particular (spatial) experience (Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan, 2007). Nonetheless, it is clear that both LTP and LTD play an important role in the enablement of long-term information storage by the hippocampus Manahan-Vaughan, 2007, 2008) and that both plasticity phenomena require mGlu5 activation (Mukherjee and Manahan-Vaughan, 2013).",

This is consistent with reports on the effects of blocking NMDA receptors (Kentros et al., 1998), blocking protein synthesis in the brain (Agnihotri et al., 2004) or deleting the transcription factor zif268/egr1 (Renaudineau et al., 2009) on place fields. Thus, once the spatial representation had been created, mGlu5 receptors were not required. However, upon entering a novel environment, both vehicle and MPEP-injected rats readily demonstrated remapping. The degree of remapping was highly similar in both groups of animals. Our findings are distinct to a study that explored the contribution of NMDA receptors to place field stability. Here, it was reported the initial remapping process that occurs in animals injected with an antagonist of NMDA receptors, was not complete, whereby the initial firing pattern in the novel environment partially resembled the pattern observed in the familiar environment (Kentros et al., 1998). We can think of two possible reasons for the difference in our findings with regard to mGlu5 antagonism and this study that addressed the effects if NMDA receptor antagonism: the first one is that NMDA receptors, but not the mGlu5 receptors, are partially involved in the initial remapping. NMDA receptors, mGlu5 receptors and protein synthesis are essential for different and contiguous phases of persistent long-term synaptic plasticity. Exposure to a new spatial environment facilitates the expression of persistent synaptic plasticity (Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan, 2004).

This suggests that the different effects on initial remapping seen during NMDA receptor and mGlu5 receptor antagonism reflect the triggering and contribution of distinct components that parallel the temporal dynamics of long-term synaptic plasticity phenomena. The second possible reason may lie within the saliency of the novel environment. In the NMDA receptor antagonism experiment described above (Kentros et al., 1998), the difference between the novel and familiar environment derived mainly from the color of the cylinder and the color of the cue card. In our study, the shape of the environment became physically changed from a familiar square to a novel circular arena. Thus, is also possible that the difference between the two environments in our study drove complete remapping in both the control and MPEP groups of animals.",

This finding offers an interesting parallel to the key role of mGlu5 in enabling long-term plasticity (Mukherjee and Manahan-Vaughan, 2013). Most of the cells in MPEP-injected rats, which initially established place fields in a novel environment, remapped on the second experiment day, when reexposed to the same environment. This contrasts to the stable firing pattern of place cells in vehicle-injected rats. This finding suggests that mGlu5 is essential for long-term but not shortterm stability of spatial representation in the hippocampus. Moreover, in contrast to the stable place cell firing pattern observed in the familiar environment, where spatial memory had been effectively consolidated, place cells of MPEP-treated rats in the non-consolidated novel environment expressed different firing patterns after a long interval of 24 h. This finding suggests that mGlu5 is critical for the stabilization of newly formed spatial representations that have not been consolidated.",

This finding contrasts with the reports from others with regard to the lack of involvement of NMDA receptors or protein synthesis in these aspects of place cell encoding. A significant decrease in firing rate measures such as peak and infield firing rates were detected, when the animals moved from the familiar to the novel environment in the MPEP group. One possible explanation is that such changes might be correlated to elevated neuronal excitability. Activation of mGlu leads to enhanced neuronal and an increase in postsynaptic intracellular calcium (Abdul-Ghani et al., 1996). In addition, mGlu5 activates somatic calcium transients (Niswender and Conn, 2010). MGlu5 also changes calcium flow through NMDA receptors (Jia et al., 1998;Mannaioni et al., 2001;Attucci et al., 2001). We observed that antagonism of mGlu5 results in a reduction of spatial information in the novel environment, and a reduction in spatial coherence in both the familiar and novel environments. However, since the mGlu5 antagonist was applied systemically, we cannot exclude the possibility that extrahippocampal effects of the antagonist also influenced on place cell activity.",

Antagonism of NMDA receptors not only prevents the induction of many forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity (Nicoll and Malenka, 1999), it also disrupts experiencedependent place cell expansion (Ekstrom et al., 2001). MGlu5, on the other hand is required for persistent synaptic plasticity, hippocampal neuronal oscillations and long-term spatial learning (Mukherjee and Manahan-Vaughan, 2013). However, synaptic plasticity and place cell stability may require other key neurotransmitter receptors. A key role in persistent synaptic plasticity and learning has also been described, for example, for mGlu1 (Mukherjee and Manahan-Vaughan, 2013) and for group II mGlu receptors (Manahan-Vaughan, 1997;Altinbilek and Manahan-Vaughan, 2009).",

Taken together with findings of other reports as to the significance of plasticity-relevant factors such as the NMDA receptors and protein synthesis for place cell responses, this suggests that synaptic plasticity and place cell encoding may be highly intertwined.",

After the injection, rats were kept in their home cages for 30 min before D1S1 started. Trial D1S1 was to test whether pre-established place fields were compromised by the injection.
