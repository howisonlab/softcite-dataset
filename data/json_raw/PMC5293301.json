            "text": "he use of skin flaps for reconstruction is associated with a procedure-dependent risk of ischemiain the range of 0.5% to 15% in pedicled and free flaps-1-4 that may lead to necrosis and flap loss. Lack of blood supply during reconstruction procedures-because of reduced in-and outflow of blood, kinking of vessels, direct pressure on flaps, and insufficient anastomosis during microsurgery-can rapidly lead to total loss of the flap and instigation of surgical salvage. The viability of a random pattern flap depends on the anatomical location, thickness, width, and length of the flap. 5 Recent research on random pattern flaps suggests that the length and thickness of the flap may be the most important factors for the distal perfusion. 6 Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-a hormone-like substance, with antiischemic, antiinflammatory, 7-9 antiplatelet, and fibrinolytic properties 10 and tissue-protective effects (originates in the vascular endothelium)-11 has been shown to increase perfusion in a rat model of cerebral ischemia 12 and in experimental studies of animals subjected to traumatic compression/decompression damage of the spine. 13 In a study on random pattern flaps in rabbits, increased distal perfusion was found up to 60 minutes after injection of PGE1. 14 In plastic surgery, laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI)-an extension of laser Doppler flowmetry that measures capillary blood flow-has been used to evaluate the depth and healing of burn wounds, 15,16 to investigate microcirculation of pressure sores, free flaps, and perforator flaps, to monitor skin flap viability, and to reliably quantify superficial skin perfusion in flaps noninvasively. 17-19",

They were divided into intervention and control groups and were anaesthetized with a commercial solution of 50% fentanyl and fluanisone (Hypnorm, 5 mg/ mL; Abbott Healthcare Products) and 50% midazolam (Dormicum, 5 mg/mL; Roche), which both first had been diluted separately with equal parts of sterile water. The solution was administered subcutaneously (0.35 mL/100 g bodyweight), and maintenance doses of 0.1 to 0.2 mL were administered by titration. After anesthesia and shaving (with an electric shaver) of the rat's back to expose the skin, an intravenous line was inserted in the tail vein for administration of PGE1. A cranial-based random-pattern skin flap was then drawn on the back (width, 2 cm; length, 10 cm) and divided into 5 numbered zones (width, 2 cm; length, 2 cm); number 5 was the most distal part (Fig. 1).",

Kuwahara et al 21 have shown that PGE1 induces vasodilatation and increases vascular flow in axial pattern flaps in rabbits. A study on ischemia-reperfusion injuries in musculocutaneous flaps in rats indicate that PGE1 downregulates the expression of intercellular adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelium and thereby reduces the endothelial leukocyte adhesion in ischemic tissue. 22 Furthermore, PGE1 has antiplatelet and fibrinolytic properties. 10 All of these mechanisms could contribute to the antiischemic and tissue-protective effects of PGE1.",

LDPI is an extension of the laser Doppler fluximetry (LDF) and has several advantages compared with LDF. LDPI is developed for horizontal mapping of cutaneous blood flow in a large area of the skin. It provides a noninvasive measurement of the capillary blood flow and is used both clinically and for research purposes. 25,26 LDPI scans a larger area with better spatial resolution than LDF and allows the researcher to measure the blood perfusion in a specified region of tissue. Thus, reproducibility is probably increased compared with LDF. Furthermore, LDPI is better suited for interindividual comparisons than LDF. 27 The inability of LDPI to measure deep subcutaneous parts of flaps (limited to 0.5to 1-mm depth) was not a problem for our study because the outcome measure was the effect of PGE1 on microcirculation of the skin (not the subcutaneous tissue)-also, the depth measured was equal in both groups. Because temperature affects microcirculation of the skin, LDPI measurements have to be done at constant temperature 28 ; all scans in our study were made under the same light intensity and at a constant room temperature of 22\u00b0C. To avoid that hemodynamic differences in the rats affected the microcirculation and LDPI measurements, we infused the same amount of fluid in both groups. To reduce potential pain and discomfort in the animals, we chose to evaluate the early effect of PGE1 before doing survival studies.",
