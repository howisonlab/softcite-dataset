In the proposed approach, quadratic surrogate models are constructed and successively updated. The generated surrogate model is then optimized instead of the underlined objective function over trust regions. Truncated conjugate gradients are employed to find the optimal point within each trust region. The approach constructs the initial quadratic surrogate model using few data points of order O(n), where n is the number of design variables. The proposed approach adopts weighted least squares fitting for updating the surrogate model instead of interpolation which is commonly used in DF optimization. This makes the approach more suitable for stochastic optimization and for functions subject to numerical error. The weights are assigned to give more emphasis to points close to the current center point. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated by applying it to a set of classical benchmark test problems. It is also employed to find the optimal design of RF cavity linear accelerator with a comparison analysis with a recent optimization technique. \u00aa 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Cairo University.",

The desired performance of a system (design specifications) is described by specifying bounds on the performance measures of the system which is set by the designer. The conventional system design aims at finding values of the system designable parameters that merely satisfy the design specifications. In general, there will be a multitude of acceptable designs. However, for contemporary engineering design, other criterion (objective function) can be chosen for comparing the different alternative acceptable designs (optimization problem) and for selecting the best one (optimal system design). Naturally, system performance measures and the objective functions are functions of system parameters values and evaluated through system simulations. For intensive CPU engineering systems, the high expense of the required system simulations may obstruct the optimization process.",

Another difficulty is the absence of any gradient information as the required simulations cost in evaluating the gradient information is prohibitive in practice [3]. Attempting to approximate the function gradients using the finite difference approach requires much more function evaluations, which highly increase the computational cost. Another objection in estimating the gradients by finite differencing is that the estimated function values are usually contaminated by some numerical noise due to estimation uncertainty. Hence, gradient-based optimization methods cannot be applied here.",

The parameters considered for optimization depend on the power level fed to the cavity, which limit the average accelerating field, where the constraints on these parameters are imposed by the application. For low power level feed, optimization may focus on maximizing shunt impedance, however for high power operation, limiting the peak fields inside is of concern in order to minimize multipacting [22].

If the conjugate gradient method terminates at a point within the trust region, this point is a global minimizer of the objective function. If the new iterate is outside the trust region, a truncated step which is on the region boundary is considered. Also, the method treats the case where the minimum is in the opposite direction of the conjugate direction which is due to the non convexity of the model [9]. One good property of this method is that the solution computed has a sufficient reduction property, which was proved by Bandler and Abdel-Malek [25]. Let s * denotes the solution of (4), and then a new point x n = x k + s * is obtained. The achieved actual reduction in the objective function is compared to that predicted reduction using the model by computing the reduction ratio which is given by:",

This explains why the proposed algorithm is well suited for objective functions that have some uncertainty in their values or subject to statistical variations. This may occur for design of systems whose parameter values are subject to known but unavoidable statistical fluctuations [1,28]. Also, the algorithm may be useful for surrogate-based system design [2,29].

The technique is applied to an RF cavity with resonance frequency 9.4 GHz, shown in Fig. 5. The objective is to maximize effective shunt impedance per unit length. In order to do that, we optimize the axial z positions of ten points that describe the cavity curvature through a spline curve. The axial positions z = (z 1 , z 2 ,. . ., z 10 ) T in the z-direction are taken as the design parameters. The radial positions of these points are chosen on a logarithmic scale along r-direction. It is to be noted that during the variation of the curvature, the    resonance frequency is always kept at 9.4 GHz. The initial values used for the ten radial positions z 0 are all set to 0.6 cm and D 1 is set to 0.02 cm. Cavity design generally requires electromagnetic field-solver that solves Maxwell equations numerically for the specified boundary conditions. In the simulations, POISSON and SUPERFISH are used as the main solver programs in a collection of programs from LANL [18,33]. The solver is used to calculate the static magnetic and electric fields and radio-frequency electromagnetic fields for either 2-D Cartesian coordinates or axially symmetric cylindrical coordinates. The code SUPER-FISH is used to solve for axisymmetric TM0nl modes, for the field components Hphi, Er and Ez. The solution is obtained through solving Hemholtz equation using finite element method FEM over a triangular mesh subject to the proper boundary conditions and symmetries imposed [34].",

In this method, the objective function is approximated via quadratic surrogates, and using few number of initial data points than the exact number of surrogate parameters. Classical benchmark test problems were used to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. The results obtained showed the ability of the proposed method to rapidly converge to the final region containing the optimum solution when only a limited number of function evaluations is permissible and when a high accuracy is not really necessary. Least-squares fitting is used instead of interpolation which explains the inaccurate solution in case of explicit objective functions. Thus, the proposed method is suitable for stochastic optimization or objectives that suffer from numerical inaccuracy. In addition, the proposed method has been used to obtain the optimal design for the structure of RF cavity which is the major part of any linear accelerator.",
