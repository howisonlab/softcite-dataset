The latter technology identified copy number variation as a major source of variation in the human genome; moreover, copy number variants were found responsible for 10-20% of cases of intellectual disability. Recent technological advances in microarray technology have also enabled the detection of very small local chromosomal rearrangements, sometimes affecting the function of only a single gene. Here, we illustrate how high resolution microarray analysis has led to increased insights into the contribution of specific genes in disease.",

            "text": "Karyotyping, a technique to visualize banded chromosomes under a light microscope, allows for the genomewide detection of chromosomal rearrangements with a resolution up to 5 Mb, roughly corresponding to the size of a single chromosome band. This technique led to the discovery of aneuploidies, such as Down's syndrome, caused by an additional chromosome 21, as well as large structural variants, including interchromosomal translocations. The introduction of targeted methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), enabled the detection of smaller rearrangements with a resolution up to 150 kb -100 bp in selected regions of the genome. More recently, the development of microarrays has enabled the detection of small aberrations on a genome-wide scale [1][2][3]. The use of genome-wide arrays in populations of healthy controls led to the discovery of copy number variation. Copy number variants are defined as deletions or duplications not detectable by conventional karyotyping, with a size of at least 1,000 bp [4]. Currently, this technique detects very local, small chromosomal rearrangements of only a few kb in addition to large copy number variants in a routine basis. Such small aberrations may affect only a single gene and, thus, create unique opportunities to study gene function. This report highlights some recent breakthroughs in genomic research made possible by the detection of such small abnormalities and looks ahead to how the increased resolution of arrays can further contribute to gene discovery.",

            "text": "Somewhat surprisingly, the percentage of our genome that can harbour copy number variants is still the subject of debate. The first large-scale microarray study utilising a 26 K tiling path bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array platform estimated that 12% of the genome is subject to copy number variants [5]. Because of the probe size of at least 100 kb, these platforms typically overestimate individual copy number variant size and, consequently, also the total copy number variant content in our genome. However, after studying more than 2,000 individuals on higher resolution arrays containing over 550,000 probes, Shaikh et al. [6] and Itsara et al. [7] concluded that 16-19.4% of the genome is subject to copy number variants. This higher proportion is mainly a consequence of the increase in sample size compared to the previous study, as the total copy number variant content was composed of many small and rare copy number variants. Consequently, it would be reasonable to expect that the estimation of 3.7% copy number variable content in the genome, which was obtained by analysing just 41 HapMap individuals on a NimbleGen array set containing~42 million oligonucleotide probesthe microarray platform with the highest possible resolution today, would increase to a similar high percentage if the study population was sufficiently large to catalogue rare variants [8].",

This database currently holds 37 microarray studies, and is, thus, a rich catalogue of human variation in healthy individuals. According to the DGV statistics consulted in June 2012, about 50% of the human reference genome may be copy number variable in healthy individuals [4]. At the moment, it is uncertain whether the cumulative variation present in the database correctly represents the copy number variant content in our genome or whether this is an overestimation. For instance, some samples, most notably the HapMap samples, have been analysed multiple times, sometimes with strikingly different outcomes in copy number variant content between different studies.",

The increased resolution of current array platforms has enabled the identification of atypical copy number variants affecting only part of the genomic region associated with the phenotype. By careful study of the clinical manifestations of patients with small copy number variants, the role of individual genes in the disease has been elucidated in some cases (illustrated in figure 1 A-C).",

Mutation analysis of these two candidate genes, MAPT and KANSL1, was performed in patients with the clinical characteristics of this disorder but without the typical deletion. Point mutations in the chromatin modifier gene KANSL1 were found in these patients, and it was concluded that the clinical characteristics of this genomic disorder can be caused by defects in this single gene [24,25]. Similarly, a long search to determine which of the genes deleted in the Prader-Willi syndrome are key contributors to the phenotype is nearly finished following the identification of a patient with a small copy number variant inside the Prader-Willi syndrome canonical region [26]. The child manifested most of the major symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome and harboured an interstitial paternal deletion encompassing only the SNORD116 C/D box small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) cluster.",

CLIP2, along with GTF2I and GTF2IRD1, were known as the key candidate genes for the characteristic cognitive and facial abnormalities associated with the Williams-Beuren syndrome.

These small copy number variants detected in patients are submitted to databases, such as DECIPHER, ECARUCA and ISCA, along with phenotypic information [38][39][40][41][42][43][44]. A closer look at the data submitted, for instance to DECIPHER, suggests that many more causative gene identifications may lie ahead of us. In this database, currently containing publicly available data from 6,000 patients, about 80 de novo single gene aberrations are present, consisting of 55 deletions and 25 duplications. Using the DAVID annotation tools [45], we found that 55% of these genes are expressed in the brain and 15% are involved in the functioning of the glutamate or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors (unpublished observations). Furthermore, genes involved in neurogenesis, differentiation and coding for developmental proteins are enriched in this set. These data clearly suggest a role for at least some of these small copy number variants in neurological disease.",

In addition, single gene deletions of the KANSL1 gene, causal for the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome, are present in this database. There are two possible explanations for this observation. First, these regions might be false positive results, as each microarray technology inherently yields a low amount of false positive results. Second, the variants may be bona fide but are not associated with the expected clinical phenotype in these individuals, either due to genetic background or to incomplete penetrance.
