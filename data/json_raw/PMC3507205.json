The Bcl-2 family modulates sensitivity to anticancer drugs in many cancers, including melanomas. In this study, we examined whether ABT-737 is effective in killing melanoma cells either alone or in combination with a proteasome inhibitor already in clinical use (Bortezomib) in vitro and in vivo, and further evaluated the mechanisms of action. Results showed that ABT-737 alone induced modest cytotoxicity in melanoma cells, but only at higher doses. Knock-down of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-X L , or Mcl-1 with siRNAs demonstrated that Mcl-1 is the critical mediator of melanoma's resistance to ABT-737 treatment. However, ABT-737 displayed strong synergistic lethality when combined with Bortezomib. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that Bortezomib increased expression of Noxa, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 member that antagonizes Mcl-1. Additionally, siRNA-mediated inhibition of Noxa expression protected melanoma cells from cytotoxicity induced by the combination treatment. These results demonstrate that Bortezomib synergizes with ABT-737 by neutralizing Mcl-1's function via increased levels of Noxa. In a xenograft mouse model, although drug doses were limited due to toxicity, ABT-737 or Bortezomib slowed melanoma tumor growth compared to the control, and the drug combination significantly decreased growth compared to either drug alone. These data imply that less toxic drugs fulfilling a function similar to Bortezomib to neutralize Mcl-1 are promising candidates for combination with ABT-737 for treating melanomas.",

            "text": "Malignant melanoma is a devastating disease since it metastasizes early and is highly resistant to all conventional treatments including chemo-, immuno-, or radiation therapy. Virtually no progress was made over the past thirty years until the recent advent of BRAF inhibitors and new immunotherapies (Buzaid, 2004;Cummins et al., 2006;Gogas et al., 2007;Eggermont, 2010;Natarajan et al., 2011). However, as promising as these new therapies are, remission and resistance are inevitable, and thus there is still a pressing need for new treatments. These recent advances are an example of how anticancer strategies have evolved from using non-specific cytotoxic agents to rationally designed drugs that target specific signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis. This moleculartargeted therapeutic approach holds the promise of providing new and more effective treatment options with minimal toxicity (Weinstein and Joe, 2006).",

            "text": "Application of BH3 mimetics to activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is a promising approach to treating various cancers (Labi et al., 2008). Using a BH3 mimetic bypasses the need to induce endogenous expression of BH3-only proteins, an ability which is often strongly inhibited in many cancers, including melanomas. One promising BH3 mimetic is ABT-737 (developed by Abbott). ABT-737 is a mimetic of the BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein Bad, and is a potent small molecule inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-X L , and Bcl-w with an affinity 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than any previously reported compounds (Letai, 2005;Oltersdorf et al., 2005). It acts like a BH3-only protein to antagonize antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, thereby diminishing their ability to inhibit apoptosis (Oltersdorf et al., 2005). Many groups have reported on the high efficacy of ABT-737 either as a single agent or as a chemo-potentiator in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents to treat multiple types of cancers (Adams et al., 2005;Oltersdorf et al., 2005;Certo et al., 2006;Konopleva et al., 2006;Shoemaker et al., 2006;van Delft et al., 2006;Chauhan et al., 2007;Chen et al., 2007;Kang et al., 2007;Kohl et al., 2007;Olberding et al., 2010;Reynoso et al., 2010;Song et al., 2010).",

We thus examined how the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-X L , and Mcl-1 modulate melanoma's sensitivity to ABT-737 using RNA interference techniques. Fig. 1 shows that simply knocking-down protein expression of these anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members individually did not induce cell death in melanoma cells. This suggests that melanoma cells have multiple redundant anti-apoptotic defenses. In contrast, knocking-down Mcl-1 (but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-X L ) protein expression sensitized these cells to ABT-737 treatment dramatically (Fig. 1B,D), from 16.4% to 77.6% Annexin V+ cells in WM852c cells (Fig. 1B), and from 16.8% to 67.4% Annexin V+ cells in A375 cells (Fig. 1D) (note that transfection of siRNA increased background cell death by Fig. 1.

We found that ABT-737 alone at 1.1 mM caused no cytotoxicity, consistent with results shown in Fig. 1A, but ABT-737 increased the effect of Bortezomib on relative cell viability ( Fig. 2A,B). To quantify whether these drug combinations exhibited synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects, we used Calcusyn software to calculate the combination index (CI) value for each experimental combination (supplementary material Fig. S1). CI values less than, equal to, or greater than one indicate synergy, additivity, or antagonism, respectively. Most of the CI values were less than 0.7 (indicating synergy), and many CI values were less than 0.3 (indicating strong synergy). These results show that a majority of the combination conditions of ABT-737 with Bortezomib displayed strong synergistic killing effects for these melanoma cell lines (supplementary material Fig. S1).

Annexin V Assays (B) and Immunoblots (C,D) were performed with A375 and WM852c cells transfected with indicated siRNAs. 24 h post-transfection, cells were then treated for 18 h with the indicated compounds before being harvested for analyses. Total Annexin Vpositive WM852c or A375 cells were averaged6s.e.m., representing three independent experiments. One-Way ANOVA; * p,0.05; ** p,0.01. (Fig. 2C). Consistent with our MTS results, ABT-737 single treatments did not significantly increase the percentage of Annexin V+ cells compared to the DMSO control. Similarly, Bortezomib single treatments only induced a small increase in the Annexin V+ cell populations. However, the ABT-737 combination treatments significantly increased the percentage of Annexin V+ cells compared to Bortezomib single treatments for both cell lines (Fig. 2C). The killing effect of the combination treatment was significantly higher than the sum effects of the individual treatments. Thus, MTS and Annexin V assays both indicate that combining ABT-737 with Bortezomib induces synergistic killing of melanoma cells.",

Only Noxa and Mcl-1 protein levels exhibited consistent and dramatic changes induced by either the Bortezomib single treatment or the combination of Bortezomib and ABT-737 ( Fig. 3A and data not  shown). The ABT-737 single treatment had little effect on most proteins examined, while the Bortezomib single treatment increased both Noxa and Mcl-1 levels substantially (Fig. 3A). The combination treatment of Bortezomib and ABT-737 increased Noxa protein expression to levels similar to the Bortezomib single treatment. However, Mcl-1 protein levels in cells treated with the drug combination were reduced to similar levels as those treated with vehicle control or ABT-737 alone (Fig. 3A). This is very similar to what we observed for the treatment of ABT-737 combined with MG-132 (Miller et al., 2009). Thus, these data suggest that the combination treatment of ABT-737 and Bortezomib induces protein expression of proapoptotic Noxa and degradation of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1.",

To further investigate the roles of Noxa expression in cell death induced by the combination drug treatments, we used RNAi techniques in WM852c and A375 cells (Fig. 3B,C,D). When cells were treated with combinations of ABT-737 and Bortezomib, blocking Noxa expression by siRNA significantly decreased Annexin V+ cells in both cell lines (Fig. 3B) (note the higher than usual positivity, compared to Fig. 2C, in the control cells due to siRNA transfection). Further, immunoblot analyses indicate that our siRNA inhibited Noxa protein induction by ,50% under the combination treatment conditions (Fig. 3C,D). Similar results were also observed in 1205Lu cells (supplementary material Fig. S3). These results suggest that Noxa is the major mediator of apoptosis induced by the combination drug treatment of ABT-737 and Bortezomib.",

While ABT-737 alone caused no observable adverse effects, Bortezomib treatment caused weight loss, lethargy, and the appearance of flaky skin. These effects were more pronounced in mice treated with both drugs, limiting the dose sizes. Although Bortezomib at doses of 1 mg/kg and above have been used in other mouse studies (Adams and Kauffman, 2004), we found that doses above 0.8 mg/kg, when combined with ABT-737 doses above 80 mg/ kg, had a profound effect on tumor growth but also caused unacceptable weight loss (data not shown), requiring premature euthanasia of the mice. Therefore, we used relatively low drug doses (0.8 mg/kg Bortezomib, 80 mg/kg ABT-737). Since larger tumors had a tendency to ulcerate, requiring mice to be removed prior to the end of the study period, we constructed Kaplan-Meier curves (Fig. 4) to compare the rates at which individual tumors doubled their original size, which allowed the inclusion of every tumor. Both ABT-737 and Bortezomib treated mice showed significantly decreased tumor doubling rates compared to vehicle treated mice (p50.005 and 0.011, respectively). Mice treated with both drugs showed decreased tumor doubling rates significantly compared to the control (p,0.0001) and to mice treated individually with ABT-737 (p50.008) or Bortezomib (p50.0173). This indicates that ABT-737 and Bortezomib can effectively reduce melanoma tumor growth in vivo, and that combining them at these doses has a small but significant additive effect.",

Thus, Mcl-1 (or A1) may act as a barrier to ABT-737-induced cell death, and it has been shown that neutralizing Mcl-1 significantly potentiates the cytotoxicity induced by ABT-737 in treating multiple cancer types (Adams et al., 2005;Certo et al., 2006;Konopleva et al., 2006;Letai, 2006;Lin et al., 2006;van Delft et al., 2006;Tahir et al., 2007;Olberding et al., 2010;Harrison et al., 2011). Our results for treating melanomas are consistent with these studies, implying that combination treatments that antagonize multiple anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are needed.",

We found it was difficult to detect A1 protein expression in melanoma cells, probably due to low expression levels (data not shown). In addition, the dramatic increase in melanoma's sensitivity to ABT-737 with Mcl-1 protein knockdown indicates that Mcl-1 is the critical mediator of resistance to ABT-737 in melanoma cells. These results indicate that combination treatments of ABT-737 with drugs that neutralize the antiapoptotic function of Mcl-1 are good treatment strategies. Moreover, resistance of melanoma cells to Bortezomib has been shown to be mediated by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Wolter et al., 2007), making ABT-737 and Bortezomib a promising combination.",

While this effect has been observed previously in melanoma cells (Qin et al., 2006), it is in marked contrast to what is observed in multiple myeloma cells, where Mcl-1 undergoes caspase-dependent cleavage (Podar et al., 2008). Likewise, ABT-737 alone can decrease Mcl-1 in multiple myeloma (Kline et al., 2007), whereas we did not observe any Mcl-1 decrease with the concentrations used in the present study. These differences are likely due to the fact that apoptosis can induce caspase-dependent degradation of Mcl-1 (Podar et al., 2008;Miller et al., 2009), and that ABT-737 alone at 3.3 mM or less did not induce apoptosis in the present study, whereas similar concentrations induce significant cell death in multiple myeloma cell lines (Kline et al., 2007). Rather, in the present study, Mcl-1 degradation appears to have taken place only upon large-scale apoptosis induced by the combination treatment. These differences underscore the different sensitivities of various cancers to chemotherapeutic drugs, and show why, in the case of melanoma, targeting multiple cellular defenses is likely necessary.",

Noxa induction appears to be a consistent mechanism for cell death in melanoma cells treated with various proteasome inhibitors (Qin et al., 2005). These data indicate that various proteasome inhibitors function through the same mechanisms when combined with ABT-737 in treating melanoma cells. Currently, more potent and less toxic, nextgeneration proteasome inhibitors are in development for clinical use (Orlowski and Kuhn, 2008;Kuhn et al., 2011).
