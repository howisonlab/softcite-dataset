The experiments indicate that it efficiently inhibits the cleavage step of the enzyme reaction, fitting well into the catalytic site. Surprisingly the compound, when incubated with the binary topoisomerase-DNA cleaved complex, helps the enzyme to remove itself from the cleaved DNA and close the DNA gap, increasing the religation rate. The compound also induces the religation of the stalled enzyme-CPT (camptothecin)-DNA ternary complex. Analysis of the molecule docked over the binary complex, together with its chemical properties, suggests that the religation enhancement is due to the presence on the compound of two oxygen atoms that act as hydrogen acceptors. This property facilitates the deprotonation of the 5 DNA end, suggesting that this is the limiting step in the topoisomerase religation mechanism."

There are two classes of topoisomerases (types I and II), both characterized by a catalytic mechanism that involves a nucleophilic attack of a DNA phosphodiester bond by a tyrosyl residue from the enzyme, but type I cleaves a single DNA strand, whereas type II cleaves both strands. The human Top1 (topoisomerase I) enzyme is composed of 765 amino acids and has four distinct domains: the NH 2 -terminal domain , the core domain (215-635), the linker domain (636-712) and the COOH-terminal domain (713-765) [1,2].

The active site tyrosine (Tyr 723 ) starts the catalytic cycle of the enzyme through a nucleophilic attack on the DNA backbone, resulting in the breakage of one DNA strand with the enzyme covalently attached to the 3 -phosphate to form the cleavable complex. After changing the linking number a second nucleophilic attack, driven by the 5 -hydroxyl DNA end, restores an intact double-stranded DNA, and the enzyme is released. In both cases, to become a nucleophile the hydroxylic group belonging to the tyrosine or to the DNA end must donate a proton to a nearby group that has been proposed to be the lateral chain of Lys 532 [2,4].",

            "text": "DNA Top IB can be inhibited by several compounds that act through different mechanisms, such as prevention of DNAtopoisomerase binding, inhibition of DNA cleavage or stabilization of the cleavable complex. Inhibitors of Top1 are divided into two classes: poisons and catalytic inhibitors. Poisons include clinically used drugs, such as the derivatives of the natural compound CPT (camptothecin) that reversibly binds the covalent Top1-DNA complex slowing down the religation of the cleaved DNA strand, thus inducing cell death [5]. Two water-soluble CPT derivatives, topotecan and irinotecan have been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for clinical use. The 3D structure of the topotecan-enzyme-DNA ternary complex has shown that topotecan mimics a DNA base-pair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating between the upstream ( \u2212 1) and downstream ( + 1) base-pairs [6] interacting also with the enzyme, acting as an interfacial uncompetitive inhibitor [5]. On the other hand, catalytic inhibitors act through inhibiting any other step of the Top1 enzymatic cycle. They include both natural and non-natural compounds [7] and they mainly act by inhibiting the cleavage [8][9][10] or the DNA binding [11,12], although some of them are able to inhibit both cleavage and religation [13,14]. The CPT derivatives are widely used in clinics; however, they have some intrinsic limits, the main one being linked to the equilibrium of the \u03b1-hydroxylactone E-ring of CPTs with the carboxylate form, which is inactive against Top1 and tightly binds to serum albumin. For this reason, other drugs are under development, the most promising one being indolocarbazoles and the indenoisoquinolines [5].",

The polycyclic system can be considered a naphthoquinone derivative and its name is due to the structural similarities with vitamin K. In this work the Et-KuQ has been reacted with the human Top1 enzyme. The main feature of its structure is the presence of a pentacyclic skeleton (similarly to CPT) with a double-quinone functional group; the five rings consist of two naphthalene units fused through a 5-membered moiety that contains an alkyl chain ( Figure 1A). Extended electronic conjugation is proved by the intense absorption spectrum with a broad band between 400 and 600 nm. These molecules were isolated as enol tautomers stabilized by the intramolecular hydrogen bond with the nearest carbonyl group, as shown in the crystal structure of the Et-KuQ derivative [17]. The strong hydrogen-bond interaction is evidenced by the very high value of the chemical shift (18 ppm) of the enolic hydrogen in the 1 H NMR spectrum. On the other hand, the shift of the relative tautomeric equilibrium towards the keto form appears to be strongly sensitive to solvent polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity. Therefore it can be reasonably assumed that the keto tautomer is favoured in aqueous media; a complete characterization of the equilibrium is under current investigation.",

The inhibitory effect is greater when the enzyme is pre-incubated with Et-KuQ before adding DNA and the compound fully inhibits the relaxation at a concentration of 12.5 \u03bcM (Figure 2A, lane 14). An additional control has been performed (C2 Figure 2A, lane 20) by adding the drug to the DNA plasmid, demonstrating that the Et-KuQ does not permit DNA migration and so does not bind to DNA. The relaxation assay carried out as function of time at an Et-KuQ concentration of 5 \u03bcM indicated that the inhibitory effect is abolished after 15 min ( Figure 2B, lane 16), demonstrating that the binding of the compound is reversible.

            "text": "The time course of the cleavage of the wild-type enzyme in the presence and absence of Et-KuQ has been followed using a suicide cleavage substrate. In detail, a 5 end radiolabelled oligonucleotide CL14 (5 -GAAAAAAGACTTAG-3 ) was annealed to the CP25 (5 -TAAAAATTTTTCTAAGTCTTTT-TTC-3 ) complementary strand, to produce a duplex with an 11-base 5 single-strand extension that is preferentially cut by the enzyme at the site indicated by the arrow (Figure 3A, top). The religation step is precluded, because the dinucleotide, generated during cleavage, is too short to be religated, leaving the enzyme covalently attached to the 3 end of the oligonucleotide. The data indicate that in the absence of the drug the wild-type protein shows a typical time-dependent cleavage of the fragment (Figure 3A, lanes 2-7), whereas pre-incubation of the enzyme with 50 \u03bcM Et-KuQ fully inhibits the cleavage reaction (lanes 8-13). The inhibitory effect of the compound, after a simultaneous incubation with both the enzyme and the suicide substrate, is also clear (lanes 14-19), although lower than that observed for the  pre-incubation. These results can be well appreciated from the plot in Figure 3(B) where the percentage of cleavage is reported as a function of time. In detail in the absence of the drug (black line) the maximum of the cleaved product is observed after 4 min, while in the presence of the drug preincubated with enzyme (grey line with circles), no cleaved product is observed in the first 4 min and a small percentage is observed in the 8-15 min time window. This result unambiguously indicates that Et-KuQ is an inhibitor of cleavage and that its interaction with the enzyme is reversible due to the appearance of a small percentage of cleaved product at long times. In order to analyse the effect of Et-KuQ on the religation reaction, Top1 was incubated with the suicide substrate, to allow the cleavage reaction ( Figure 4A, lane 1). The religation is then followed in the absence of the compound ( Figure 4A, lanes 2-7), or by pre-incubating the cleavable suicide complex with 50 \u03bcM Et-KuQ before adding 200-fold molar excess of the complementary R11 oligonucoleotide ( Figure 4A, lanes 8-13) or adding Et-KuQ together with the religation substrate ( Figure 4A, lanes 14-19). In all the experiments, the KCl concentration is maintained at 350 mM when R11 is added to the samples, in order to avoid the religated product being cleaved again by the protein, since cleavage reaction is inhibited at high salt concentration [24]. Aliquots have been removed at different times, the reaction stopped by addition of SDS and the products analysed by PAGE ( Figure 4A). The Figure clearly shows that Et-KuQ, when preincubated for 10 min with the covalent complex, stimulates the rate of religation (lanes 8-13), the amount of product formed being much higher than in the reaction carried out in the absence of Et-KuQ, or without preincubating it with the covalent complex. A quantitative analysis of this result is shown in the graph in Figure 4(B). This is to our knowledge the first time that a small organic compound acts as a stimulator of the Top1 religation reaction. The same experiment, performed using an excess of Et-KuQ (200 \u03bcM), shows that, at this high Et-KuQ concentration, an increase of the rate of religation is observed also when the compound is added together with the R11 substrate (see Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.bioscirep.org/bsr/033/bsr033e025add.htm).",

The assay was done at two different times: 1 and 2 min, respectively, for the substrate and the enzyme alone (lanes 1 and 2), in the presence of 50 \u03bcM CPT (lanes 3 and 4), or with 50 \u03bcM Et-KuQ (lanes 5 and 6), or after incubating the reaction mixture with 50 \u03bcM CPT and then adding 50 \u03bcM Et-KuQ and stopping the reaction after another minute (lane 7), or incubating with 50 \u03bcM Et-KuQ for 1 min and then adding 50 \u03bcM CPT and stopping the reaction after another minute (lane 8). The reactions were stopped with SDS, the samples digested with trypsin and the products analysed by PAGE ( Figure 5A).  the labelled DNA strand is detected ( Figure 5A, lanes 1 and 2). When the enzyme is in the presence of 50 \u03bcM CPT the cleavage/religation equilibrium is shifted towards cleavage, since CPT reversibly binds to the covalent DNA-enzyme intermediate, stabilizing it and slowing down the religation rate, as indicated by the band indicated by the asterisk corresponding to the substrate cleaved at the preferred site ( Figure 5A, lanes 3 and 4)  [5,29,30]. The band of the cleavage complex is not observed when Et-KuQ is added to the enzyme together with the substrate (Figure 5A, lanes 5 and 6), confirming that the compound inhibits the cleavage step. In line with this, incubation for 1 min of the enzyme, the substrate and the Et-KuQ, followed by addition and incubation of CPT for another minute, shows a band ( Figure 5A   19). In lane 1 the cleaved complex, which represents time 0, has been loaded. In lane 20 no protein was added. 'Cl1' represents the DNA fragment cleaved at the preferred enzyme site; 'Religation' is the restored fully duplex oligonucleotide that is the final product of the reaction. (B) Percentage of religation, determined by ImageQuant software, was plotted as a function of time and normalized to the plateau value for the experiment with Top1 alone.

            "text": "Three molecular docking experiments were performed on the Et-KuQ deprotonated form ( Figure 1A), in order to study the molecular mechanism underlying the observed inhibition of cleavage and the enhancement of religation. The first-docking experiment was performed using as a receptor the crystal structure of the Top1-DNA non-covalent complex [3] after DNA removal. The complexes obtained have been subjected to clusterization and the largest cluster shows that Et-KuQ interacts with the Top1 catalytic pentad with an energy of \u2212 9.6 kcal/mol (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ) ( Figure 6). In this structure the Et-KuQ deprotonated oxygen molecules are at hydrogen bonding distance with the sidechains of three residues of the catalytic pentad: Arg 488 , Arg 590 and Tyr 723 . This conformation is consistent with the observed inhibition of the DNA cleavage, and with the increase of the inhibition in the case of pre-incubation ( Figure 3). The second docking experiment was performed on the Top1-DNA covalent complex [3]. Owing to the presence of DNA covalently bound to the catalytic Tyr 723 , Et-KuQ cannot bind in the position previously observed in Figure 6 for the docking with the protein alone. When the docking is made with the Top1-DNA covalent complex, Et-KuQ has a binding site in proximity of the catalytic pentad with energy of \u2212 9.8 kcal/mole ( Figure 7). In this complex the ethyl group of the drug and its aromatic scaffold show van der Waals interactions with the DNA major grove at the level of the bases in positions \u2212 1 and + 1, while the deprotonated oxygen molecules of Et-KuQ form an hydrogen bond with the lateral chain of Asn 722 (Figure 7). This structure permits us to provide an interpretation of the effect of the compound during the religation process. In fact, the deprotonated oxygen molecules of Et-KuQ that represent a strong hydrogen acceptor site [17] and that can then help the deprotonation process that the hydroxyl group of the 5 DNA terminal must undergo to reseal the cleaved DNA strand, are at an average distance from the DNA O5 of 6.7\u00c5 (Figure 7). In the crystal structure of the covalent enzyme-DNA binary complex the distance between the DNA O5 and the N\u03b6 Lys 532 , that is considered the proton acceptor site, is 7.2\u00c5 [4,6]. The relatively short distance between the DNA O5 and a proton acceptor site provides an explanation for the increase of the religation rate observed in the presence of Et-KuQ, shown in Figure 4.  In order to confirm that this mechanism can be involved in the displacement of CPT by Et-KuQ ( Figure 5), a third docking experiment was performed on the CPT + TopoI + DNA ternary complex. In this complex the CPT interfacial inhibitor intercalates between the cleaved DNA bases, making the distance between the O5 DNA end and the Lys 532 N\u03b6 proton acceptor as long as 11.9\u00c5 [6]. Docking experiments indicate that Et-KuQ can bind in proximity of the Top1 catalytic pentad with an energy of \u2212 10.7 kcal/mol (Figure 8), forming a complex where the Et-KuQ deprotonated oxygen molecules are at distance of 7.4 A from the hydroxyl of the 5 DNA end, i.e. the same distance observed between the 5 end and the Lys 532 in the X-ray covalent binary complex [3]. In the docked complex, Et-KuQ makes contacts with the DNA bases in positions + 1 and \u2212 1 through its carbon scaffold and forms a hydrogen bond with the Lys 755 of the CTD (C-terminal domain) of Top1 through the deprotonated oxygen molecules. The relatively short distance between the Et-KuQ deprotonated oxygen molecules and the cleaved DNA 5 -terminal (about 7\u00c5) makes possible the 5 deprotonation process, permitting the release of the cleaved complex even in the presence of CPT as experimentally observed ( Figure 5).",

On the other hand, the proximity between the oxydryl of the DNA 5 end and the two close oxygen atoms (Figure 7), acting as efficient hydrogen acceptors, explains the ability of the compound to act as an enhancer of the enzyme religation rate (Figure 4). The Et-KuQ pK a defining the equilibrium between the protonated and deprotonated form is 5.6 in solution ( Figure 1) and this value can be slightly modulated by the protein environment, facilitating the acceptance of an hydrogen by the two oxygen molecules that are at an average distance of 6.7\u00c5 from the oxydryl group of the DNA 5 end in the docked complex with the covalent enzyme-DNA structure (Figure 7). This distance is shorter than the one observed in the X-ray diffraction structure between the O5 and the lateral chain of Lys 532 (3), that is supposed to be the proton acceptor in the reaction in the absence of any external compound [4]. This short distance, coupled with the hydrogen acceptor property of the two oxygen molecules, explains the increased religation rate promoted by Et-KuQ.",

In this case the Et-KuQ oxygen molecules-O5 DNA distance, observed in the docked structure, is about 7\u00c5 (Figure 8), permitting the deprotonation of the DNA oxydryl group. In this latter case two possible mechanisms can be envisaged. (1) The DNA oxydryl group releases its proton to the Et-KuQ oxygen molecules and the deprotonated 5 end forces the CPT displacement promoting the religation reaction. (2) The DNA hydroxyl group releases its proton to the Et-KuQ oxygen molecules and the reversible binding of CPT finds the deprotonated 5 ready to religate during the CPT off process. In both cases, the final result is that the religation occurs and CPT is displaced.",

It is probable that the same mechanism proposed for Et-KuQ can also work for the poly(ADPribose) polymer. The complex structure of the poly(ADP-ribose), made by many phosphate groups, may facilitate the deprotonation of the 5 DNA end, again facilitating the religation. It can then be concluded that facilitation of the deprotonation of the 5 DNA end is the crucial process to promote religation.",

The most striking result is obtained upon addition of Et-KuQ to the enzyme previously reacted with the substrate in the presence of CPT. The Et-KuQ addition brings to 50 % destabilization of the cleaved complex stabilized by CPT (Figure 5A, lane 7 compared with lane 4). This result indicates that Et-KuQ is able to stimulate the religation even in the presence of CPT, overcoming the poisoning effect of the drug on inhibiting the religation. A quantification of the cleaved complex observed in the different assays is shown in the histogram of Figure 5(B), that indicates the ability of Et-KuQ to reduce the CPT stabilization of the cleaved complex (compare lane 4 with lanes 7 and 8). These data provide evidence that Et-KuQ has a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
