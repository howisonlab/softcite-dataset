Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) codifies a potent immunomodulator and pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates diverse pathological processes. A promoter 308G.A polymorphism in TNF-a has been implicated in RHD risk. However, the results remain controversial. Therefore, to evaluate more precise estimations of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. A total of 7 studies including 735 RHD cases and 926 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, our results revealed that there was a significant association with RHD risk in three genetic models (homozygous model:"

As shown in Figure 3, the shape  of the funnel plots did not show asymmetrical in the dominant model, suggesting absence of publication bias. Moreover, we did not find significant publication bias in the Egger's test (t 5 0.07, P 5 0.945 in the dominant model). Sensitivity analysis was carried out by removing each study.

In turn, TNF-a can stimulate cytokine secretion, increase the expression of adhesion molecules as well as activate neutrophils 23,24 . TNF-a has been shown to be relevant for the physiopathology of various inflammatory conditions like rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, and RHD 25 . Furthermore, the TNF-a 308G.A promoter polymorphism has been reported to be associated with high TNF production and this has been associated with increased susceptibility for many inflation diseases 26,27 . Therefore, it is biologically plausible that the TNF-a 308G.A polymorphism is associated with RHD risk. Compared with the literature by Shen et al. 22 , we also performed a stratification of ethnic and source of controls in our study, which could explain the difference results among Asians and Europeans. As a result, in the stratified analysis, we found that the main association was pronounced among Asians and Europeans, suggesting that there was no different genetic background contributing to the risk of RHD. However, there was no reported study on African populations. Therefore, additional studies are needed to elucidate the possible ethnic differences in the effect of TNF-a 308G.A polymorphism on RHD risk. Importantly, when stratifying by source of controls, a significantly elevated risk was observed among hospital-based studies but not among populationbased studies. This may be due to that the hospital-based case-control studies have some selection biases because such controls might not be a representative of the general population 28 . Thus, the selection bias and matching criteria should be considered in the design of case-control study. Some limitations of this meta-analysis should be addressed. First, the ORs extracted from each eligible study were based on unadjusted estimates, because not all studies reported adjusted ORs. Second, the number of each ethnic subgroup was relatively small, which limited the statistical power to detect the association between the TNF-a 308G.A polymorphism and RHD risk among Asians and Europeans. Third, there was significant between-study heterogeneity from studies of the TNF-a 308G.A polymorphism, and the genotype distribution also showed deviation from HWE in one study 18 .",
