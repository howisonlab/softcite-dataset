            "text": "Aims/Introduction: Our previous study found that dexamethasone-induced insulin resistance (IR) was involved in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) synthesis and 5-hydroxytryptamine 2 receptor (5-HT 2 R) in the periphery. The present study examined the effects of inhibitions of both peripheral 5-HT synthesis and 5-HT 2 R on dexamethasone-induced IR. Materials and Methods: Male rats were exposed to dexamethasone for 10 days, then treated with or without a 5-HT 2 R antagonist, sarpogrelate, a 5-HT synthetic inhibitor, carbidopa, alone or in combination for 20 days. Results: Dexamethasone-induced whole-body IR, with glucose intolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia, could be effectively abolished by sarpogrelate or/and carbidopa, whereas IR-related actions of dexamethasone in tissues were accompanied by increased 5-HT synthesis in the liver and visceral adipose, and upregulated 5-HT 2 R (5-HT 2A R and 5-HT 2B R) expression in these two tissues as well as in skeletal muscle. Sarpogrelate or/and carbidopa treatment significantly abolished dexamethasone-caused tissue-specific IR. In the liver, increased gluconeogenesis, triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein syntheses with steatosis, and downregulated expression of plasmalemmal glucose transporter-2 were markedly reversed. In the visceral adipose and skeletal muscle, downregulated expression of plasmalemmal glucose transporter-4 was significantly reversed, and increased lipolysis was also reversed in the visceral adipose. Dexamethasone-induced activations of hepatic mammalian target of rapamycin serine 2448 , and S6K threonine 389/412 phosphorylation were also abolished markedly by sarpogrelate or/and carbidopa. Co-treatment with sarpogrelate and carbidopa showed a synergistic effect on suppressing dexamethasone actions. Conclusion: Inhibitions of both peripheral 5-HT synthesis and 5-HT 2 R are expected to be a dependable target for treatment of steroid-induced diabetes. side-effect profile, such as development of type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart diseases, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, depression and especially whole-body insulin resistance (IR) 1. Chronically elevated GC levels have been linked to fatty liver development, and as a result, could contribute to hepatic steatosis 2. Insulinresistant and glucose-intolerant patients have an elevated GC",

            "text": "Serotonin, also called 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is synthesized by a two-step enzymatic pathway, in which tryptophan is first converted to 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP) by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph), and 5-HTP is next converted to 5-HT by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) 10,11 . There are two subtypes of Tph, Tph1 and Tph2, presenting in the periphery (Tph1) and center (Tph2), respectively 12 . As to 5-HT receptors (5-HTR), seven receptor classes, including 14 subtypes of 5-HTR belonging to seven subfamilies (5-HT 1 R to 5-HT 7 R), have been identified to date, reflecting the diversity of serotoninergic actions 13 . The 5-HT 2 R family including three subtypes, named 5-HT 2A, 2B, 2C receptors, are expressed predominantly in peripheral tissues, with similar structure, pharmacological properties and signaling pathways 13 . It has been found that serum levels of 5-HT are elevated in diabetic patients, and the increasing concentration in serum is a marker of diabetic complications [14][15][16] . Therefore, glucose metabolism and obesity might be etiologically associated with 5-HT 17,18 , as well as adipocyte differentiation mediated by 5-HT 2 Rs in vitro 19 . Upregulation of the 5-HT 2A R is often found in obesity and diabetes, which leads to high blood sugar level 20 , and GC treatment can increase density of serotonin 5-HT 2A R in humans 21 .",

To examine the hypothesis that GC-induced IR can be effectively treated by inhibition of both peripheral tissue's 5-HT synthesis and 5-HT 2 R, insulinresistant rats induced by long-term exposure to dexamethasone (Dex) were treated with an AADC inhibitor, carbidopa (CDP), or/and a 5-HT 2 R antagonist, sarpogrelate (Sar).

Animals were kept on a standard 12-h light/dark cycle with access to water and food ad libitum throughout the experiment. First, male Sprague-Dawley rats (10-weeks-old, purchased from B&K Universal Group Limited Shanghai, China; license number: SCXK [Hu] 2013-0006) were subcutaneously given normal saline (control rats) or 0.75 mg/kg bodyweight Dex (Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Injection; Cisen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Jining, China; diluted with normal saline) twice daily on the morning and afternoon with a 12-h interval for 10 days, to make a model of Dex-induced IR. We found that long-term treatment with 2.0 mg/kg bodyweight Dex twice daily, as had been carried out in another investigation 23 , easily led to increased mortality of rats, whereas a dose of 0.75 mg/kg bodyweight twice daily was safer, and also induced a marked IR in these rats. The consequences of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia were judged by measuring the levels of fasting blood glucose and blood insulin on day 10 after initiating Dex exposure. Then, the Dex-exposed rats were divided into four groups randomly (n = 8 per group): model group, Dex-exposed with Sar (sarpogrelate hydrochloride; Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Osaka, Japan), a broad-spectrum antagonist of 5-HT 2 R, -treated group (Sar group), Dex-exposed with CDP (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), an inhibitor of AADC, -treated group (CDP group), and Dex-exposed with Sar and CDP cotreated group (Sar+CDP group). The treatments were twicedaily, carried out for 20 days with an oral administration at 1 h before Dex exposure. In the Sar group, Sar at 25 mg/kg bodyweight was given twice daily before Dex exposure, which was lower than previously reported 24 . In order to execute a parallel comparison between Sar and CDP treatment, 25 mg/kg bodyweight CDP treatment twice daily was also carried out in the CDP group, whereas that in the Sar+CDP group was of a mixture with both (Sar : CDP = 2:1) as an equal dose with both the Sar and CDP group. The drugs were all dissolved with a vehicle 0.5% CMC-Na, and were made to the same concentration of 5.0 mg/mL with the same delivery volume (0.50 mL/ kg bodyweight), whereas rats in the control and model group were given 0.5% CMC-Na (0.50 mL/kg bodyweight).",

In agreement with a previous study 22 , the expressions of Tph1 and AADC (Figure 4a,b) were detected in the liver and visceral adipose tissues, but were not detected in the skeletal muscle (data not shown), whereas rats' chronic exposure to Dex showed markedly upregulated Tph1 and AADC expression in both tissues. Accordingly, 5-HT levels in the serum and three tissues (Figure 4d) were increased significantly by Dex, which were inhibited by CDP in a dose-dependent manner in the CDP or Sar and CDP co-treatment rats, whereas Sar alone did not obviously change 5-HT levels in the serum or in the three tissues. More importantly, the fold increases of 5-HT levels in the liver and visceral adipose tissue in the model group were higher than that in the serum, whereas that in the serum and skeletal muscle tissue were similar, showing that increased 5-HT by Dex in the liver and visceral adipose tissue come from 5-HT synthesis in the tissue itself rather than serum, which was different with 5-HT inside the skeletal muscle, which comes from the serum. Upregulated expressions of 5-HT 2A R and 5-HT 2B R by Dex in the three tissues were also detected (Figure 4a-c). In addition, we found very low content of dopamine in the liver, skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue, which was not altered by Dex exposure with or without CDP or/and Sar treatment (data not shown), suggesting that Dex-induced IR and CDP or/and Sar effects in the liver, skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue were not associated with dopamine.

            "text": "GC-induced whole-body IR involves the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. In the liver, GC stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis through induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-1 and glucose-6-phosphatase 1 , enhances insulinstimulated hepatic de novo lipogenesis by upregulation of ACCase and FA synthase 34,35 , and increases VLDL production and secretion 36 . Several indirect mechanisms also likely play a role in GC-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, including increased lipolysis in visceral adipose tissue, which results in more FFA to be delivered to the liver through the blood, and systemic hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, which drive hepatic de novo lipogenesis 37 . Ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver have been strongly associated with hepatic IR with whole-  body IR, and to represent an important marker of cardiovascular risk, such as atherosclerosis, possibly even more so than visceral fat 38,39 . Though GC-induced lipolysis in white adipose tissue is controversial, GC promotes lipolysis by increasing messenger RNA expression of the two key lipolytic enzymes, hormone-sensitive lipase and ATGL, and has been found in adipose tissue through investigations of rats exposed to GC in vivo and adipocytes exposed to GC in vitro 33,40,41 , and Cushing syndrome patients through microdialysis 42 . Increased lipolysis will result in elevated circulating FFA, which in turn can induce IR 40,43 . Though it is controversial as to whether glucose uptake is inhibited by GC in adipose tissue, one study showed that in the omental, but not in the subcutaneous, adipocytes in humans, GC decreases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake 44 . GC is also found to decrease insulin-mediated glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle, which can occur through stimulation of serine kinases, resulting in phosphorylation and inactivation of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate molecules 45 . In the present study, we found that GC-induced whole-body IR, and tissue-specific IR in the liver, visceral adipose and skeletal muscle are involved in enhanced 5-HT synthesis in the liver and visceral adipose, and upregulated 5-HT 2A R and 5-HT 2B R in these tissues. Dex-induced IR can be abolished effectively by inhibition of both 5-HT 2 R with Sar and peripheral 5-HT synthesis with CDP, and be strongly abolished by the combination of Sar and CDP in a synergistic manner, suggesting that the combination of Sar and CDP might be a dependable method for curing steroid-induced diabetes. Furthermore, the Sar or CDP effect was not owing to their impact on bodyweight or food intake, as Sar or/and CDP treatment resulted in a reversal to Dex-caused weight loss with a complete suppression to Dexinduced weight loss, but no reversal with a further decrease to the food intake in the rats. In addition to decreased food intake, the mechanisms of GC-caused weight loss are reduction in overall protein synthesis while promoting muscle proteolysis, and enhanced gluconeogenesis to result in hyperglycemia and glucose lost through urine 46,47 . Thus, we presume that Sar or/ and CDP treatment also attenuates Dex-stimulated effects on protein metabolism, as well as suppressing gluconeogenesis. Additionally, though CDP is expected to lower dopamine production, Dex or CDP did not lead to a change in dopamine level in the present study, showing that dopamine is not the cause for GC-induced IR. We presume that a major action of AADC in the liver and visceral adipose is to assist 5-HT synthesis rather than dopamine. It is presumed that the majority of 5-HT in the periphery is produced by the entero-chromaffin cells in the gut 48,49 , and 5-HT is then majorly taken up and stored in platelets in circulation 50 . Dex-induced production of 5-HT in the entero-chromaffin cells has been observed in the small intestine, especially in the duodenum of rats 51 . However, both our previous study 22 and present study found that 5-HT is also synthesized in the liver and visceral adipose tissues, which were upregulated by Dex with upregulated expressions of both Tph1 and AADC, and that increased 5-HT levels by Dex in both tissues came from tissue itself rather than the blood. 5-HT by acting on 5-HT 2A R mediates hepatic steatosis and IR has been shown in several studies 24,52 , whereas activation of the mTOR-S6K pathway has been shown to be the mechanism of 5-HT action in the liver 53 , and in the adipocytes and C2C12 myotubes by inhibition of insulin-stimulated activation of the IRS-1-AKT signaling pathway with glucose uptake 54 . The present study showed that Dex-induced activations of mTOR Ser 2448 and S6K Thr 389/412 phosphorylation in the liver tissue were accompanied by upregulations of hepatic 5-HT synthesis, and 5-HT 2A R and 5-HT 2B R expression, followed by hepatic IR, such as increased gluconeogenesis, downregulation of GLUT2 expression on the cell membrane, and increased TG and VLDL synthesis with steatosis in the liver tissue. More importantly, the aforementioned liver-IR markers induced by Dex could be abolished significantly by inhibition of 5-HT 2A R and 5-HT 2B R with Sar or 5-HT synthesis with CDP, and were more effectively abolished by the combination of Sar and CDP, suggesting that GCinduced hepatic IR is closely involved in increased hepatic 5-HT synthesis and 5-HT 2 R. In addition, the present study also suggested that Dex-stimulated lipolysis in the visceral adipose tissue resulted in increased serum FFA level, and downregulation of plasmalemmal GLUT4 expression in the visceral adipose and skeletal muscle tissue, and might very likely be involved in adipose-specific upregulation in 5-HT synthesis and 5-HT 2 R expression, and muscle-specific upregulation in 5-HT 2 R expression. We also found that it is both 5-HT 2A R and 5-HT 2B R instead of 5-HT 2A R alone 24,52 that mediate 5-HT-stimulated IR in the three tissues, both of which were upregulated by Dex. The precise mechanisms need to be studied further.",

Inhibitions of both peripheral 5-HT synthesis and 5-HT 2 R can be used in the treatment of GC-induced IR with diabetes. In addition, great elevation of HDL-c level in serum by the combination of Sar and CDP in the Dex-exposed rats, with great suppression on Dex-caused enhancement of LDL-c level in serum, showed that inhibition of both peripheral 5-HT synthesis and 5-HT 2 R might also be an effective method for the treatment of atherosclerosis, as the goal of lowering total cholesterol and LDL-c, and raising HDL-c in blood has become a very important health issue for preventing or treating atherosclerosis 55 .",
