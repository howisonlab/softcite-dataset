In experimental glomerulonephritis, however, angiotensin II (AngII) infusion has also been shown to be renoprotective. We evaluated the long-term (28 days) course of anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis in animals with suppressed AngII formation by ACE-I treatment. Methods: Brown Norway rats received perindopril (2.8 mg/kg/day, n = 12), dihydropyridine calcium-antagonist amlodipine (Ca-A; 13 mg/kg/day, n = 6) or were left untreated (n = 14). All animals were monitored for blood pressure, proteinuria, and creatinine clearance after anti-Thy1 injection. Renal histology was assessed at day 7 and 28. Results: Systolic blood pressure was equally reduced by ACE-I and Ca-A treatment. AngII suppression prevented development of proteinuria, but did not protect against glomerular microaneurysm formation or reduction in creatinine clearance. After resolution of the microaneurysms, animals with suppressed AngII production showed a modest increase in glomerulosclerosis and vasculopathic thickening of intrarenal vessels. Conclusions: In anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis, suppression of AngII formation does not protect against the induction of glomerular damage and is associated",

It therefore offers the potential to study various components of renal disease. Thy1 is expressed on glomerular mesangial cells. Binding of the anti-Thy1 antibody delivered by single injection results in complement-mediated mesangiolysis with secondary endothelial damage [1,2] . The model is self-limiting and fully reversible in healthy animals, while uninephrectomized rats injected with anti-Thy1.1 antibody develop progressive glomerulosclerosis [3] .",

            "text": "The potent antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) are well established. Angiotensin II (AngII) is a pathogenic factor in various renal diseases. However, AngII may also have renoprotective effects in early stages of kidney disease development. Stimulation of renal angiogenesis by AngII occurs during physiological postnatal kidney development [4] and drives the accelerated glomerular recovery seen after infusion of AngII during early-phase anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis [5,6] . Consistently, glomerular endothelial cell proliferation after anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis was inhibited with AngII receptor blockade [7] . The attenuated glomerular injury with AngII infusion is in apparent contrast with previous studies in the anti-Thy1 model suggesting attenuation of renal damage by treatment with ACE-I or AngII receptor blocker [7][8][9][10][11][12][13] . The latter studies reported improvement mainly in terms of reduced proteinuria and early reduction of matrix expansion. We hypothesized that the suppression of AngII formation would not improve late-stage renal function in anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis despite possible antiproteinuric effects. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of ACE-I treatment using perindopril on proteinuria, creatinine clearance, induction of glomerular damage and renal histological recovery in nephritic rats. To dissociate direct effects of ACE-I treatment from those on blood pressure reduction, we also included nephritic rats treated with the dihydropyridine calcium-antagonist amlodipine (Ca-A) in our study.",

Here, we show that ACE-I treatment during anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis effectively reduces the development of proteinuria, but does not protect against the induction of glomerular damage or decline in renal function. ACE-I treatment could not prevent glomerular microaneurysm formation and was even associated with a modest but statistically significant accentuation of glomerulosclerosis and vasculopathic thickening of intrarenal vessels. Our study indicates that the multiple pathophysiological components during the course of anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis are differentially affected by the suppression of AngII formation.",

            "text": "We show a potent protective effect of ACE inhibition on the proteinuria occurring during the development of glomerular damage. Several previous studies have similarly shown a reduction in proteinuria during anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis by treatment with ACE-I or AngII receptor blockers [7][8][9][10][11][12][13] . Consistently, proteinuria tended to stay elevated for a longer period of time when rats with anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis received AngII infusion [6] . Proteinuria is a practical and powerful indicator of the course of renal disease [18] . Preventing or reducing proteinuria by ACE-I is well-established and likely to make a major contribution to the beneficial effects of ACE-I on the course of renal disease. Proteinuria is thought to not only reflect renal damage, but also play a pathophysiological role in the progression of renal damage itself [19] . Indeed, in the aforementioned studies of ACE inhibition in anti-Thy1 glomerulonephritis, early matrix remodelling was inhibited. In our study, glomerular microaneurysm formation was not reduced by ACE inhibition. As glomerular microaneurysm formation reflects the degree of endothelial damage, the antiproteinuric effects do not appear to be attributable to endothelial protection but may be mediated through another mechanism. Such a specific antiproteinuric effect of ACE-I treatment may be explained by direct effects on the selective properties of the glomerular membrane size [20] independent of the effects on the glomerulonephritic disease process.",
