A total of 72 participants were enrolled from patients arranged for surgeries of cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy, and spinal operation. Each blood group (A, B, AB, and O) contained 18 participants. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and bispectral index (BIS) were assayed with Philips monitor. These indexes were observed before propofol anesthesia (T 0), and then were recorded when concentration of propofol was 1 mg/mL (T 1), 2 mg/mL (T 2), 3 mg/mL (T 3), and 4 mg/mL (T 4). The differences in MAP, HR, and BIS at T 0 among groups were compared with the x 2 test. Multiple comparisons were adopted to calculate the differences in MAP, HR, and BIS between groups at T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , and T 4. No significant differences in age, sex, and weight of all groups were found (P > .05). Before propofol anesthesia (T 0), all the participants exhibited no differences in MAP, HR, and BIS (P > .05). Subsequently, we found obvious differences in DMAP, DHR, and DBIS between groups. The patients in the B blood group showed highest DMAP and DHR at each time point (P < .05 for both). As for DBIS, patients in A blood group exhibited highest value at T 3 and T 4 (P < .05). The blood group remarkably affects the anesthetic effects of propofol. Abbreviations: BIS = bispectral index, HR = heart rate, IR = ischemia-reperfusion, MAP = mean arterial pressure, RSE = refractory status epilepticus, VWF = Von Willebrand factor.",

            "text": "Propofol, 2, 6-disopropylpphenol, is the most popular intravenous anesthetic drug. [1] It has many advantages above other anesthetic drugs: rapid onset, short duration, few side effects, and prompt recovery. [2] The sedative efficacy of propofol for children has been confirmed in clinical trials since the 1900s. [3][4][5] However, most patients experience unpleasant pain at its injection site. Apart from anesthesia effects, many articles reported the nonanesthetic roles of propofol, such as antiemetic effects, anxiolytic effects, immunomodulatory activity, and analgesia. [6,7] Meanwhile, propofol and thiopental sodium are commonly used for managing refractory status epilepticus (RSE). [8,9] Until now, propofol, as an anesthestic agent, is widely used in various surgeries.",

            "text": "In the study of Hari Keerthy et al, [10] propofol behaved better than midazolam in minor oral surgery for fast recovery and onset of action. Chen et al [11] reported that propofol used for the maintenance of general anesthesia greatly reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and improved the postoperative patient well-being. Moreover, it resulted in obvious cost reductions. After the hernia surgery of children, propofol could impair short-term memory postoperatively, compared to sevoflurane. [12] For the patients undergoing donor hepatectomy, propofol exerted protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. [13] According to previous studies, the efficacy of propofol is affected by many factors. Obesity is potentially associated with the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of anesthetic drugs. [14] The study of Olutoye et al [15] suggested that obese children require lower dose of propofol for induction of anesthesia than normal-weight children. Meanwhile, elderly patients might need lower doses of propofol for procedural sedation in the Emergency Department, compared with younger adults. [16] Choong et al [17] concluded that more rapid propofol metabolism may occur in women than men. However, no research investigated the influence of ABO blood group on the efficacy of propofol.",

As we all know, decreased blood flow velocity, hypercoagulable blood, and injuried vessel wall usually occurred during anesthesia performance in surgeries. Moreover, the patients with different ABO blood groups exhibited significantly different levels of Von Willebrand factor (VWF). The patients of O blood group had obviously lower content of VWF than the non-O blood group, which was directly related with incidence of thrombosis. [25][26][27][28] VWF is an adhesive glycoprotein synthesized by megakartocytes and endothelial cells. [29,30] It shows crucial roles in primary hemostasis and, moreover, has a pivotal role in thrombogenesis. [31] It has been demonstrated that the increased level of VWF is an important risk factor of thrombosis. [32,33] In vitro experiment suggested that removal of A and B antigens from purified plasma decreased VWF activity. [34] Moeller et al [35] thought that ABO antigens in vivo affected synthesis rate or proteolysis of VWF molecule rather than its structure and function. Meanwhile, many studies have demonstrated a tight correlation between the ABO blood group and hemostasis. The patients of group O are more likely to suffer bleeding complications. [36] Moreover, a number of studies reported the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in non-O individuals. [37,38] All the above-mentioned information suggests that ABO blood group might involve in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics, which was demonstrated in our study.",
