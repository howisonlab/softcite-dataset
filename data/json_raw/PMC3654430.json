            "text": "Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroidal plant hormones that play an important role in the growth and development of plants. The biosynthesis of sterols and BRs as well as the signalling cascade they induce in plants have been elucidated largely through metabolic studies and the analysis of mutants in Arabidopsis and rice. Only fragmentary details about BR signalling in other plant species are known. Here a forward genetics strategy was used in Petunia hybrida, by which 19 families with phenotypic alterations typical for BR deficiency mutants were identified. In all mutants, the endogenous BR levels were severely reduced. In seven families, the tagged genes were revealed as the petunia BR biosynthesis genes CYP90A1 and CYP85A1 and the BR receptor gene BRI1. In addition, several homologues of key regulators of the BR signalling pathway were cloned from petunia based on homology with their Arabidopsis counterparts, including the BRI1 receptor, a member of the BES1/BZR1 transcription factor family (PhBEH2), and two GSK3-like kinases (PSK8 and PSK9). PhBEH2 was shown to interact with PSK8 and 14-3-3 proteins in yeast, revealing similar interactions to those during BR signalling in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, PhBEH2 also interacted with proteins implicated in other signalling pathways. This suggests that PhBEH2 might function as an important hub in the cross-talk between diverse signalling pathways."

            "text": "The importance of steroidal hormones in mammalian development has already been known for almost eight decades. The idea that plant steroids have hormonal functions arose when scientists reported the isolation of brassinolide (BL), a steroid with strong plant growth-promoting activity, from bee-collected pollen of Brassica napus L. (Grove et al., 1979). Brassinosteroids (BRs) are widely distributed among the plant kingdom and so far they have been found in gymnosperms, monocots, dicots, a pteridophyte, a bryophyte, and a chlorophyte (Bajguz and Tretyn, 2003). The subsequent identification of several BR biosynthesis and signalling mutants further supported the importance of these compounds for growth and development, and nowadays BRs are accepted as phytohormones. BRs are involved in various growth and developmental processes such as cell division and elongation, vascular differentiation, abiotic and biotic stresses, photomorphogenesis, germination, senescence, and fertility (Clouse and Sasse, 1998;Bajguz and Hayat, 2009).",

            "text": "The sterol biosynthesis pathway can be divided into three domains (Fig. 1). In the first part, the mevalonate-derived squalene is converted via multiple steps into 24-methylene lophenol. Subsequently, the pathway diverges into two downstream branches. One branch produces sitosterol and stigmasterol, while the other produces campesterol. These sterols are integrated into cellular membrane components. In addition, the biosynthetic precursor campesterol is utilized to synthesize BRs (Lindsey et al., 2003). Plants have multiple ways to synthesize BL from campesterol. Detailed studies on the BR biosynthesis route in Catharanthus roseus and Arabidopsis thaliana led to the identification of two parallel branched routes, better known as the early and late C-6 oxidation pathways that converge at catasterone (Fig. 1). The two pathways are linked to each other, implying that they are not totally autonomous (Shimada et al., 2001). Although the early and late C-6 oxidation pathways are found throughout the plant kingdom, it seems that in species such as tomato and tobacco the late C-6 oxidation pathway is more prevalent (Nomura et al., 2001). Fujioka et al. (2002) identified an early C-22 oxidation pathway, also named the CN-independent pathway, that merges into the late C-6 oxidation pathway, constituting the major route to produce biologically active BRs as shown in Fig. 1  (Onishi et al., 2012;Zhao and Li, 2012). In addition, two shortcuts were reported that convert 22-OH-3-one and 3-epi-6-deoxoCT via C-23 hydroxylation to 6-deoxy3DT and 6-deoxyTY, respectively (Ohnishi et al., 2006).",

However, mutants that are affected in genes functioning in early steps of the sterol biosynthesis pathway such as FACKEL (FK), STEROL METHYL TRANSFERASE 1 and 2 (SMT1, SMT2), and HYDRA1 (HYD1) are embryo lethal and cannot be rescued by application of exogenous BR.

            "text": "BR signalling has primarily been elaborated by studies in Arabidopsis. The currently known BR signalling pathway in Arabidopsis runs from membrane to nucleus (reviewed by Clouse, 2011). A key event is the degradation of a negative regulator of BR signalling, the Arabidopsis GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2; Kim et al., 2009). The negative effect of BIN2 on BR signalling is performed via phosphorylation of the closely related plant-specific transcription factors BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) and BRASSINOZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1; Wang et al., 2002;Yin et al., 2002). It was shown that other Arabidopsis GSK3like protein kinases (ASKs) act redundantly with BIN2 in the BR signalling pathway (Vert and Chory, 2006;Kim et al., 2009;Yan et al., 2009;Rozhon et al., 2010). Phosphorylation of BES1/ BZR1 results in inhibition of their activity through proteasomemediated degradation, cytoplasmic retention by 14-3-3 proteins, and inhibition of their DNA binding and transcription activation activities (Li et al., 2001;He et al., 2002;Yin et al., 2002;Vert and Chory, 2006;Gampala et al., 2007;Ryu et al., 2007).",

The authors' petunia collection was browsed for mutants that exhibit a typical BR deficiency phenotype; five BR biosynthesis or signalling mutants were identified and their BR content was determined. In three cases, the tagged genes could be identified. Furthermore, several petunia homologues of key components of the BR signalling pathway in Arabidopsis were isolated and it was determined if a similar network of interactions between these factors can occur. It was also found that several components of other hormone pathways could interact with the petunia homologue of a member of the BES1/BZR1 family of transcription factors. These interactions reveal new mechanisms, not previously recognized, that suggest extensive cross-talk between BR signalling and other hormone signalling pathways."

Wildtype petunia, like tomato, does not accumulate BL, but rather castasterone (CS), as the bioactive compound (Table 2). In the cd1 mutant, the levels of CS and 6-deoxoCS were greatly reduced. The amounts of sterols were similar to those of the wild type, indicating no lesion in sterol biosynthesis. Therefore, cd1 seems to be mutated in an unknown brassinosteroid enzyme. Concomitantly with a large decrease in the CS and 6-deoxoCS levels, the cd2 mutant overaccumulated 22-OH-CR, indicating a mutation in the petunia CYP90A1 (CPD) gene. In the cd3 mutant, massive accumulation of 6-deoxoCS was observed, suggesting that this mutant has a defect in the conversion of 6-deoxoCS to castasterone, a reaction that in tomato is catalysed by the CYP85A1 enzyme (Bishop et al., 1999). In the cd9 mutant, sterols are abundant but the pathway end-products CS and 6-deoxoCS were severely reduced. In cd9, 22-OH-CR, 22-OH-3-one, and 6-deoxoCT accumulated, suggesting a mutation in a CYP90C1-or CYP90D1-like b Due to reduced fertility, cd2 allelism was confirmed molecularly as independent insertions in PhCYP90A1 (see text).",

            "text": "The obtained sequence data of petunia BR biosynthesis genes were used to determine in each cd mutant if any of these known genes is disrupted by a dTph1 insertion. When DNA isolated from cd2 plants (Fig. 3A) was used as a template, PCRs identified dTph1 insertions at different sites in the petunia homologue of the BR biosynthesis gene CYP90A1 (Szekeres et al., 1996)  (Fig. 3D, F). The dTph1 transposon insertion in allele cd2 W2254 was found in the first exon, ~80 nucleotides after the ATG. The other three mutants (cd2 P2013 , cd2 P2015 , and cd2 P2018 ) carry a dTph1 insertion at different sites in the second exon (Fig. 3D). Plants in progeny of cd2 W2254 occasionally gave rise to revertant shoots ( Fig. 3B).  PCR and sequence analysis on genomic DNA extracted from a revertant shoot (cd2 M2194-4 ) revealed excision of dTph1 from CYP90A1, leaving a 6 bp footprint (Fig. 3F). Furthermore, a stable cd2 mutant (cd2 M2194-1 ) was identified in which excision of dTph1 created an 8 bp footprint (Fig. 3F). The identity of cd3 P2014 was revealed by mining a 3D indexed petunia insertion database generated from the ENZA population (Vandenbussche et al., 2008). A transposon-flanking sequence unique for family P2014 showed homology to CYP85A1 (Bishop et al., 1999). The dTph1 element was identified in exon 6 of the petunia CYP85A1 homologue (Fig. 3E). In progeny of cd3 P2014 , a stable mutant was shown to carry a mutant allele containing a 7 bp footprint (cd3 S2007 ). In plants carrying the cd3 D2213 allele, a transposable element could not be identified in the petunia CYP85A1 homologue. However, sequencing of the CYP85A1 coding sequence from one of the progeny (family cd3-K2066) showed an 8 bp footprint in exon 1, indicating the previous existence of a transposable element at this site (Fig. 3E, F).",

In Arabidopsis, the BES1/BZR1 transcription factor family plays an important role in the regulation of BR-responsive genes (Zhao et al., 2002). A PCR-based approach was performed to identify potential petunia homologues. Primers were developed based on the sequences of all six BES1/BZR1 family members of Arabidopsis and a nested 3' RACE-PCR on petunia leaf cDNA yielded a PCR fragment of the desired size. Sequence analysis revealed high sequence identity with members of the BES1/BZR1 family. The 5' end was isolated by SOTI-PCR (see the Materials and methods). The derived amino acid sequence has the highest sequence identity to the BES1/BZR1 family member AtBEH2 (64.2%) and therefore the clone was named PhBEH2 ( Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). Like the previously characterized BES1/BZR1 family members from Arabidopsis, PhBEH2 has a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) at its N-terminus. The central part of PhBEH2 is rich in serine/threonine residues that match with the phosphorylation sites for GSK3 kinases (Wang et al., 2002). In addition a PEST motif was identified that seems to play an important role in protein degradation as BES1 and BZR1 proteins were stabilized in bes1-D and bzr1-D mutants carrying a mutation in this motif (Wang et al., 2002;Yin et al., 2002).",

As many transcription factors carry activation domains, auto-activation of the fulllength cDNA of PhBEH2 on yeast reporters was tested first. Indeed, introduction of the PhBEH2-GAL4-binding domain fusion resulted in some activation of the HIS reporter, but selection on histidine and adenine resulted in no growth ( Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online) Subsequently, the full-length cDNA of PhBEH2 was used as bait to screen a two-hybrid cDNA library made from young petunia inflorescence, and 12 interacting proteins were found (Fig. 5B, C). Sequence analysis showed that five of these proteins were 14-3-3 proteins. Another interesting interacting partner, which was named PSK8, had high similarity to the GSK3-like kinase BIN2 from Arabidopsis (Fig. 5C). Other interaction partners include proteins homologous to SECRET AGENT (SEC), which is an O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), ARIA (ARMADILLO Repeat protein Interacting with ABF2), TPL (TOPLESS), and two RRM (RNA recognition motif) proteins of which one is a homologue of FPA (Flowering Protein A; Fig. 5C).",

As numerous interactions with PhBEH2 were detected, the search was restricted to interactions known from Arabidopsis research. In addition, the aim was to verify the interaction with the potential OGT PhSEC. As positive controls, free YFP as well as a fusion between PhBEH2 and GFP were used (Fig. 5D, E). When fused to GFP, BEH2 was mainly detected in the nucleus, but clearly in the cytoplasm too. For BiFC, translational fusions of PhBEH2, Ph14-3-3k, PSK8, and PhSEC with the N-and C-terminal halves of YFP were generated. Interaction was detected between PhBEH2 and 14-3-3k (Fig. 5G), PSK8 (Fig. 5F, H), and PhSEC (Fig. 5I). The interaction between PhBEH2 and 14-3-3k occurred in the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas interaction with PSK8 and PhSEC appeared almost exclusively in the nucleus. It thus seems that at least in the case of 14-3-3k, PSK8, and PhSEC, the interaction with PhBEH2 can also occur in plant cells.",

As this clone lacked the 5' half of the cDNA, SOTI-PCRs (see the Materials and methods) were performed to isolate the remaining part. This clone was renamed PSK9. Both PSK8 and PSK9 are related to BIN2 as they group together with the other group II ASKs (Fig. 6A). Kim et al.

In order to investigate this, yeast two-hybrid assays were performed with members of the BES1/BZR1 family and the group II GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinases from Arabidopsis and petunia. AtBIN2 interacted with AtBES1, AtBZR1, and also with BEH2 from petunia (Fig. 7). A similar behaviour was found for the petunia BIN2 homologue PSK8. However, PSK9 did not bind to PhBEH2 or to the Arabidopsis members. As the interaction with PSK8/ BIN2 showed that the fusions of BES/BZR proteins with GAL4-AD are functional in yeast, it seems that either PSK9 does not interact with the BES1/BZR1 family or the fusion between PSK9 and the GAL4-binding domain is somehow not functional. The yeast-two hybrid results suggest that group II GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinases and members of the BES/BZR1 family from Arabidopsis and petunia are structurally highly homologous.",

In cd9, the levels of 22-OH-3-one, 3-epi-6-deoxoCT, and 6-deoxoCT that are substrates of CYP90C1 (ROT3)/CYP90D1 were higher as compared with the wild type, indicating a potential deficiency in a CYP90C1/CYP90D1-like activity (Fig. 1). However, the Arabidopsis CYP90C1/CYP90D1 double mutant does not accumulate 22-OH-3-one, 3-epi-6-deoxoCT, and 6-deoxoCT (Ohnishi et al., 2006). It thus seems that, in contrast to the situation in Arabidopsis, the CYP90C1 (ROT3)/CYP90D1 activity in petunia is encoded by a single enzyme. dTph1 insertions could not be found in the ROT3 homologue of cd9, but it cannot be ruled out that the insertion might be located in the 5' or 3' part that currently is lacking. Altogether, the evidence available points to unknown BR biosynthesis enzymes or perhaps regulators of BR biosynthesis enzymes mutated in cd1 or cd9. Cloning of the responsible genes can be accomplished in the future by using amplified fragment length polymorphim (AFLP)-based transposon display or high throughput sequencing of dTph1-flanking sequences (Van den Broeck et al., 1998;Vandenbussche et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The interaction spectrum of PhBEH2 in yeast supports a role in BR signalling. First, PhBEH2 is capable of interacting with Arabidopsis BIN2 (Fig. 7), a proven negative regulator of BR signalling (Li et al., 2001). Secondly, the PhBEH2 protein interacted with several 14-3-3 proteins (Fig. 5C). Previous research in Arabidopsis showed that 14-3-3 proteins increase the cytoplasmic retention of phosphorylated BES1/ BZR1 (Gampala et al., 2007). Mutation of a BIN2 phosphorylation site in BZR1 was shown to abolish 14-3-3 binding, leading to increased nuclear localization of the BES1/BZR1 protein (Bai et al., 2007;Gampala et al., 2007). Like AtBZR1 and AtBES1, PhBEH2 also possesses the conserved putative 14-3-3-binding site, suggesting that the regulation of the BZR1/BES1 family by 14-3-3 proteins might be conserved among plants. Thirdly, PhBEH2 interacted with a petunia GSK3-like kinase (PSK8) that belongs to the group II GSK3like kinases (Figs 5, 7). Arabidopsis group II GSK3-like kinases have been shown to regulate BR signalling negatively by phosphorylating the BZR1/BES1 family (Vert and Chory, 2006;Yan et al., 2009;Rhozon et al., 2010). To reveal the involvement of PSK8 in BR signalling, phosphorylation of PhBEH2 by PSK8 should be demonstrated and knock-outs might ultimately reveal their function. In addition to PSK8, another group II member (PSK9) was also identified in petunia. Based solely on similarity, it seems likely that PSK9 is also involved in BR signalling. The lack of interaction with PhBEH2 and Arabidopsis BES1 and BZR1 might be due to aberrant processing of the PSK9-GAL4 fusion RNA and/or protein in yeast.",

            "text": "Multiple links between petunia BR signalling components and other pathways were identified. For instance, PhBEH2 interacts with a protein that has high sequence homology to ARIA, a positive regulator of the ABA signalling cascade. PhBEH2 also interacts with two proteins containing RRMs. One of the RRM proteins is a homologue of FPA, a gene that regulates flowering time in Arabidopsis via a pathway that is independent of daylength (Schomburg et al., 2001). Various connections between flowering and BRs have been revealed (Domagalska et al., 2007;Lee et al., 2008a, b;Yu et al., 2008). This is consistent with the finding that BR biosynthesis mutants as well as signalling mutants are late flowering or, like the cd10 (petunia bri1) mutant, non-flowering. Although interesting, further research should confirm these findings.",

Using PhBEH2 as bait, PSK8 was isolated, but using the same cDNA library the reverse interaction was not identified. It might be that none of the BES1/BZR1 family members present in the library is in-frame with the GAL4binding domain. Nonetheless, the yeast two-hybrid screen with PSK8 might have revealed other roles of group II GSK kinases that have not been recognized yet."

So far, the action of GSK kinases in plants was found to occur via phosphorylation of transcription factors such as those belonging to the BES1/BZR family. Here, the identified interactions infer a direct role for GSK3-like proteins in the regulation of enzyme-like proteins, a mechanism that has interfaces with some of the roles of GSK3 in animals."
