Methods: Nineteen male soccer players volunteered to participate in this study. We followed the young elite soccer players during a competitive half season. Venous blood samples were collected between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. after an overnight fast (10 h) at baseline, after 45 and 90 days and hematological and biochemical parameters were measured. Results: Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were significantly reduced over the observational period (p<0.05), but erythrocyte count and iron levels remained unchanged. Bilirubin and ferritin levels significantly increased in response to regular soccer training (p<0.05). We observed a significant decrease in muscle enzyme plasma activity during the 90 days study period. ANOVA analysis revealed a significant increase in the leukocyte and neutrophil counts (p<0.05), in parallel with a significant decrease in the lymphocyte count (p<0.05) after the observational period of 90 days. Conclusions: Elite soccer players are characterized by significant changes in biochemical and hematological param-",

Metode: Devetnaest fudbalera je dobrovoljno u~estvovalo u ovoj studiji. Mlade elitne fudbalere smo pratili tokom druge polovine sezone. Uzorci venske krvi su sakupljeni nata{te, izme|u 9.00 i 10.00 ~asova, na po~etku studije i nakon 45 i 90 dana redovnih treninga, i odre|eni su osnovni biohemijski i hematolo{ki parametri. Rezultati: Nivo hemoglobina i hematokrit se zna~ajno smanjuju u toku posmatranog perioda (p<0,05), dok su broj eritrocita i koncentracija serumskog gvo`|a ostali nepromenjeni. Nivo bilirubina i feritina se zna~ajno pove -}ava kao posledica redovnih treninga (p<0,05). Zapazili smo zna~ajno smanjenje nivoa mi{i}nih enzima u serumu tokom 90 dana. ANOVA je otkrila zna~ajno pove}anje broja leukocita i neutrofila (p<0,05), kao i zna~ajno smanjenje broja limfocita (p<0,05) posle 90 dana redovnih treninga. Zaklju~ak: Elitni mladi fudbaleri pokazuju zna~ajne promene u vrednostima biohemijskih i hematolo{kih parametara tokom druge polovine sezone, koje su posledica treninga, ali i adaptacije na fizi~ku aktivnost.

In addition to intensive daily training sessions, players are involved in additional commitments such as national cups and other matches. These competitive demands may impose strains to various physiological systems, including the musculoskeletal, nervous, immune and metabolic, which might be reflected in changes in the biochemical and hematological parameters (1). Despite its diffu sion and popularity, very few studies have been performed concerning the biochemistry and hematology of soccer players. Surprisingly, hematological parameters and biochemical characteristics which can be crucial for predicting optimal physical performance have been scarcely examined in elite soccer players, who are involved in very demanding competitive seasons. We followed the young elite soccer players during a competitive half season. In the present study, we report and discuss the hematological and biochemical behavior of the athletes, in order to get more insight in the physiological characteristics of these sportsmen and to provide trainers and sports doctors with useful indicators.",

            "text": "The stability of hematologic status indices is one of the key determinants of optimal exercise performance, particularly in endurance sports such as soccer. Several investigators suggested that the value of hematologic indices and iron status measures in elite athletes varies during the season as a consequence of different training regimes (3)(4)(5). It was shown that hematological parameters were higher at the beginning of the competition season and then declined in well-trained athletes (6). Although low values of hematological variables have been observed in athletes during intensive training periods compared with clinical norms (7), other investigations have verified normal concentrations of hematological indices throughout training programmes (5,8). We observed that hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV and transferrin diminished significantly in the soccer players during the first 45 days of regular training. The decrease in Hb and Ht during a competitive season might be an indicator of heavy effort, as showed in aerobic heavy sports such as cycling and triathlon (9, 10), endurance and ultra endurance events (11), but also in football (6). However, despite the decrease in Hb and Hct, we did not detect any decrease in the red blood cell count. Accordingly, other studies showed a decrease in Hb and Hct and no changes in RBC or total red blood cell volume (12,13). Generally, training induces hemodilution due to plasma volume expansion, which is a compensatory mechanism that increases cardiac output and reduces blood viscosity, thereby optimizing microcirculation and improving oxygen delivery to the working muscle (14). In fact, we observed a plasma volume expansion from base-line to day 45 (Table III), which reinforces the pre mise that the decrement in Hb and Hct during competitive half season occurs because of the plasma volume expansion.",

In the present study, bilirubin levels in soccer players increased significantly over the 3 months of regular training. However, we did not detect any impairment at the level of the circulating erythrocyte pool. In addition, we could observe neither an increase in serum iron levels potentially reflecting hemolysis, nor an increase in transferrin levels possibly showing accelerated erythropoiesis secondary to hemolysis. On the other hand, it may be that increased myoglobin levels, due to muscle damage, and subsequent myoglobin degradation, also contribute to the increased bilirubin production.",

Other studies showed decrease in ferritin during the season in runners and swimmers (17), as well as in subjects performing a 12-week period of heavy training (18). The results of the present study are similar to those reported in the study of Banfi et al. (5), with a significant increase in ferritin levels at the end of the observational period. In addition, we observed a positive correlation between ferritin and bilirubin levels in soccer players. Increased levels of bilirubin detected in the present study could suggest hemolysis and release of free iron in the blood. Iron is essential for normal cell growth and proliferation. However, excess iron might be potentially harmful, as it can catalyze the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species via Fenton chemistry. Therefore, the increased levels of serum ferritin might be an adaptive response to increased oxidative stress mediated by iron, because ferritin sequester iron in blood or in cells and attenuate its pro-oxidant activity. The results of our study are in accordance with several results supporting a role of ferritin in the protection against oxygen free radical-mediated damage (19,20).",

Previous studies reported lower serum Cre in cyclists, Nordic skiers and swimmers (21,22) and higher serum Cre levels in soccer and rugby players than those observed in controls (23). Values of serum Cre in young soccer players exceeded the reference intervals for the general population (62-115 mmol/L) over the entire observational period. This difference may be linked to the generally higher muscle mass in athletes, because total muscle mass is the most important determinant of the creatine pool size and creatinine production (24). As previously demonstrated, we found significant correlation between the Cre concentration and BMI (21,25). Serum Cre levels in soccer players decreased significantly throughout the study, which might be associated with the increase in training and competition workloads during competitive season.

Regular soccer training induced decrease in plasma UA in soccer players, which might be related to lower release of hypoxanthine from the muscle. Enhanced capacity of muscles to regenerate ATP might be one of the reasons for this (28).

We observed increased plasma muscle enzymes in soccer players above normal values during the entire competitive season, which might indicate extensive cell damage and an impaired functional status of the muscle tissue. Exercise-induced trauma to the musculature has been shown to lead to an inflammatory response and migration of phagocytic cells into the affected area. We noticed increased neutrophil counts over the observational period, which was accompanied with increase in hs-CRP levels. Such changes implicate that regular soccer training might be associated with minor inflammatory events. Increase in CRP, if observed chronically, is associated with increased risk of coronary vascular disease (31). On the other hand, repair of muscle injury is dependent on inflammatory mediators and it is not clear whether this inflammatory response needs to be curbed for better recovery and improved function. Despite the obser ved increase in neutrophil count and hsCRP levels, the magnitude of muscle damage in soccer players was reduced significantly over the observational period, as a result of adaptation and conditioning of the muscle through regular training and was not compromised by proinflammatory changes (32).",
