Methods: Participants were conveniently sampled from malls and were given a self-completed questionnaire that collected the patient's demographic information and their knowledge about the pharmacist's dispensing service. They were then presented with a description of the pharmacist's dispensing service, the risk of medication errors in prescriptions and their consequences, and the risk reduction of medication errors associated with pharmacist intervention. The willingness to pay (WTP) of the participants was later assessed using a contingent valuation interview that asked the likelihood and maximum amount they were willing to pay. Results: In the study, 100 people participated, and 57% were aged between 18 and 35 years. Of these participants, 51% were women, and 46% of them earned more than 1000 MYR (285.71USD) per month. In addition, 8% of the participants had never visited a community pharmacy. Finally, 67% of the participants were willing to pay for the pharmacists' dispensing service, and the median amount that the participants were willing to pay was 10 MYR (2.86USD). The WTP amount was moderately correlated with their knowledge of the community pharmacist's dispensing services (r=0.377, p=0.02). Conclusion: Generally, the public valued the pharmacist's dispensing service. Their acceptance can be further improved by educating the public on the role of the pharmacist."

M\u00e9todos: Se muestre\u00f3 convenientemente a los participantes en los centros comerciales y se les dio un cuestionario de auto-cumplimentaci\u00f3n que recog\u00eda informaci\u00f3n demogr\u00e1fica del paciente y sus conocimientos del servicio de dispensaci\u00f3n de los farmac\u00e9uticos. Se les presentaba una descripci\u00f3n del servicio de dispensaci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica, el riesgo de os errores de medicaci\u00f3n y sus consecuencias, y la reducci\u00f3n del riesgo de errores de medicaci\u00f3n asociada con la intervenci\u00f3n del farmac\u00e9utico. La voluntad de pagar (VDP) de los participantes se evaluaba despu\u00e9s utilizando una entrevista de evaluaci\u00f3n del contingente que preguntaba la probabilidad y la cantidad m\u00e1xima que estaban dispuestos a pagar. Resultados: \u00a100 personas participaron en el estudio y el 57% estaban entre 18 y 35 a\u00f1os. De estos participantes, el 51% eran mujeres y el 46% de ellos ganaba m\u00e1s de 1000MYR (285,71USD) al mes. Adem\u00e1s, el 8% de los participantes nunca \u00b4hab\u00eda visitado una farmacia comunitaria. Finalmente, el 67% de los participantes estaba dispuesto a pagar por el servicio de dispensaci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica; y la mediana que los participantes estaban dispuestos a pagar era de 10MYR (2,86USD). La VDP estaba ligeramente correlacionada con su conocimiento de los servicios de dispensaci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica (r=0,377, p=0,02). Conclusi\u00f3n: En general, el p\u00fablico valoriz\u00f3 el servicio de dispensaci\u00f3n farmac\u00e9utica. Su aceptaci\u00f3n puede mejorarse educando al p\u00fablico sobre el papel del farmac\u00e9utico.",

Although the original separation intention was not based purely on public health perspective, the fact that this separation can promote a rational utilisation of medicine, reduce medication errors, and minimise ethical conflicts of physicians as prescribers and suppliers have prompted several other countries to separate these roles accordingly. 3 However, in some countries such as Malaysia, the physician is still allowed to assume the role of dispensing due to the historical shortage of pharmacists. There has now been a significant increase (6397 pharmacists in 2008) in the pharmacist workforce since the country's independence 52 years ago, with 500 pharmacists expected to graduate annually from the country's 14 schools of pharmacy. 4 Despite this increase, there remains substantial government reluctance to change the physicians' role due to the perceived negative public benefit. 5 ",

For all statistical tests performed, the significance level was set a priori at P<0.05. Table 1. Description of the nature and benefit of the pharmacists' dispensing service. Assume that you are taking your prescription to a pharmacy for filling. At first, the pharmacist will screen your prescription to identify any potential medication errors, including incorrect medicine usage or possibility of the medicine in the prescription interacting with your condition or other medicine you are taking. Research has found that three out of ten prescriptions have medication errors. It is important to identify and solve these problems because they will lead to adverse reactions, such as rash, diarrhoea or reduced effectiveness of the medicine. Other research by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that there is at least one death per day and 1.3 million people are injured each year due to medication errors, including wrong medicine and improper dose. Here, the role of the pharmacist is to assist you in the prevention of the undesired outcomes by correcting any medication errors through professional screening, counselling and evaluation. The Jonna Briggs Institute in Australia has found that community pharmacists can reduce the risk of medication errors by 20%.",

Most of the participants (54%) were educated to the tertiary education level, and 31% of the participants were unemployed. In addition, 8% of the participants had never visited a community pharmacy. Only 18% of the participants had more than 67% knowledge about the pharmacist's dispensing activities. Concerning the dispensing activities, 34 participants knew that the pharmacists validate prescriptions, 32 participants knew that pharmacists check prescriptions for interactions, 42 participants knew that pharmacists solve medicinerelated problems, 52 participants knew that pharmacists provide counselling, 16 participants knew that pharmacists document the dispensing activity, and 22 participants knew that pharmacists do drug monitoring as part of their dispensing role."

One possible explanation for this observation is that the Malaysian public may not feel comfortable paying out-of-pocket for health services that are usually free or included in the physician's fee; however, this was not explored in the present study. The mechanism of payment for dispensing the service was not stated in the survey, and this may have influenced the participants' negative decision, not because they do not value the service, but because they feel that their insurance should cover it."

However, this study also found that the more knowledgeable the consumers were about the pharmacist's dispensing service, the higher amounts they were willing to pay for the service. Once the consumers have more knowledge of the pharmacist's dispensing service, they will have better insight about the role that the pharmacists play in providing the service, which results in a higher value for the service.",
