Usually, it could be defined as a system that uses the information to produce the appropriate changes in organizational culture, systems and processes to achieve optimal performance agreement targets, allocation of resources, information management on possible modifications of business strategy or sharing the results continued individual goals. In many cases, the performance is very crucial competitive advantage in the market. Due the performance monitoring the companies can find the Key Performance Indicators, also known as KPIs that help to organization define and measure progress toward organizational goals. The main aim of the paper is to find which factors of corporate performance system are in Czech companies important. To find these factors was used theoretical information from the area of KPIs and data from primary research (questionnaire survey). This data are applied by statistical evaluation of selected indicators which can help determine the significance of the indicators in the monitored area.",

A \"high\" value of alpha is often used (along with substantive arguments and possibly other statistical measures) as evidence that the items measure an underlying (or latent) construct. However, a high alpha does not imply that the measure is unidimensional. If, in addition to measuring internal consistency, you wish to provide evidence that the scale in question is unidimensional, additional analyses can be performed. Exploratory factor analysis is one method of checking dimensionality. Cronbach's alpha is not a statistical test; it is a coefficient of reliability (or consistency). It could be written as a function of the number of test items and the average inter-correlation among the items. Below, for conceptual purposes, we show the formula for the standardized Cronbach's alpha: this article were obtained from the project funded by the Grant Agency (Czech Science Foundation), named \"Construction of Methods for Complex Multifactor Assessment of Company Performance in Selected Sector\", No. P403/11/2085. Empirical research deals with factor analysis that gives up reduction of surveyed corporate performance indicators which companies use in own measurement process. Main input into factor analysis was correlation matrix. From this matrix were obtained data that tell us, that in our case correlations exist only on four economic indicators (Free cash flow, Value added per personal costs, Value added per employee, Market share). Then we found two strongest component groups. In connection with the KPIs it is possible to insert only Market share and Value added per employee. Free cash flow and Value added per personal costs could be involved in KRIs.",
