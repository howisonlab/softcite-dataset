We selected 45 highly mutated genes with whole-exome sequencing in 10 normal matched samples of the AML-M2 subtype. To evaluate these genes, we performed concept lattice analysis and annotated these genes with existing knowledge databases.",

            "text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most wellstudied diseases in the genomic research area [1,2]. AML occurs usually in middle-aged people and is diagnosed by increasing leukemic myeloblasts in blood over 30% [3]. AML is a genetically heterogeneous disease, since 1/3 of AML patients have chromosomal rearrangements, like t(8;21) and t (15;17), but other AML patients have normal karyotypes [4]. With recent advances of high-throughput genomic technology, a favorable prognosis has been observed with some genetic changes in cytogenetically normal AML [5]. These results were reflected by the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria; the NMP1 and CEBPA mutations were included in the 2008 revision of these criteria [6]. The molecular change of AML is considered to be the accumulation of somatic mutations in hematopoietic progenitor cells [7]. Next-generation sequencing technology gave us new insights into the clonal heterogeneity of leukemic mutations so that we can make an explanation why some of these mutations are highly re-producible but others are very rare [8]. Still, in 30% of cytogenetically normal AML, the genetic causality origin or strongly associated genetic changes have not yet been discovered [9,10].",

To filter the known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we used dbSNP bulid 137. We removed PCR duplicates and filtering low-quality SNPs by Samtools 0.1.18 [13], Picard 1.68 [14], and GATK 2.3.4 [15]. After the filtering process, the SAM file was converted to VCF file by VCF Tools 0.1.10 [16]. For detecting somatic mutation candidates, we obtained the difference in VCF files between tumor and normal samples. For annotation of these somatic mutation candidates, we used the ANNOVAR tool [17].",

FCA is a useful method in conceptual clustering of objects, attributes, and their binary relationship. In FCA, the sets of formal objects and formal attributes together with their relation to each other form a \"formal context,\" which can be represented by a crosstable. In our case, the objects are 10 AML samples, and the attributes are 45 highly mutated genes. We defined the formal context as K = (G, M, I), where G is a set of objects (i.e., samples), M is a set of attributes (i.e., mutated genes), and I \u2286 G \u00d7 M is the incidence relations where (g, m) \u2286 I if object g has attribute m. For A \u2286 G and B \u2286 M, we define the operators A' = {m \u2208 M|gIm for all g \u2208 A} (i.e., the set of attributes common to the objects in A) and B' = {g \u2208 G|gIm for all m \u2208 B} (i.e., the set of objects common to the attributes in B).

SYNE1 gene encodes a spectrin repeat-containing protein expressed in skeletal and smooth muscle and peripheral blood lymphocytes that localizes to the nuclear membrane [21]. This gene is not a well-known leukemic gene but is observed in some hematological malignancies and other cancer types [22]. In glioblastoma, SYNE1 mutation is significantly correlated with the overexpression of several known glioblastoma survival genes [23]. In the case of sample 3, the ITGAX gene, encoding ankyrin repeat domain 18A, was mutated. This gene is well known by the association with leukemia [24] and lung cancer [25]. For sample 4, the possible oncogene is LAMC3. LAMC3 gene encodes laminins, which are the major non-collagenous constituent of basement membrane. LAMC3 mutations are associated with several cancers, including colon cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma, and candidate tumor suppressor genes in bladder transitional cell carcinoma [26]. LAMC3 is involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway, since it has a role in cell adhesion. The ANKRD18A gene is the oncogene candidate for sample 7 and is a novel epigenetic regulation gene in lung cancer [25]. Therefore, it is possible that the pair relationship of those genes (ITGAX-SYNE1, LAMC3-SYNE1, and ANKRD18A-SYNE1) could contribute together to evolve the leukemic cell transformation.",
