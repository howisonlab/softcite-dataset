A stochastic production function, using translog functional form, was used to compare efficiency measures of farmers in mechanized cassava-processing villages compared with the farmers in nonmechanized cassava-processing villages in 2014. Given the specification of the translog production function, the mean technical efficiencies of the farmers were 0.69 and 0.52 in mechanized and nonmechanized villages, respectively. The significant determinants of technical inefficiency among the respondents are farming experience, education, membership of farmer association, access to markets, sale of cassava to processors and farmers who planted cassava as sole crop are all negative, which confirm to a priori expectations and significant at different levels. The policy implication of the study is that mechanization of cassava processing, particularly if done at the right scale, could create demand that can transform primary production for increased yields, higher incomes and production efficiency of smallholder farmers who constitute a significant proportion of Uganda's agricultural sector."

It has tolerance to poor soils and resistance to drought, a cheap and reliable source of food that fits well into the food security strategy of smallholders (Nweke, Spencer, and Lynam 2004;FAO 2003). Cassava has, therefore, served many times as food of last resort to ameliorate the effect of food deficits which occur from erratic weather conditions and reduce the yields of cereals.",

The adoption of these simple, mechanized postharvest processing steps (such as grating, chipping and pressing) and technologies such as the production of high-quality cassava flour and cassava chips were expected to increase the demand for fresh cassava in the rural areas. In addition, they could enhance farmers' willingness to adopt improved production technologies, particularly new varieties, fertilizer and improved farming practices, which can increase cassava productivity and expand production."
