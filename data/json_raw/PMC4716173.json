            "text": "The evidence of an association between calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and cancer is conflicting. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the risk of cancer (all, breast, prostate and colon cancers) in association with exposure to CCB. Methods: This is a population-based cohort study in patients exposed to CCBs from across the UK, using two comparison cohorts: (1) patients with no exposure to CCB (non-CCB) matched on age and gender and (2) unmatched patients unexposed to CCB and at least one other antihypertensive (AHT) prescription. Cancer incidence rates computed in the exposed and the two unexposed groups were compared using HRs and 95% CIs obtained from multivariate Cox regression analyses. Results: Overall, 150 750, 557 931 and 156 966 patients were included, respectively, in the CCB, non-CCB and AHT cohorts. Crude cancer incidence rates per 1000 person-years were 16.51, 15.75 and 10.62 for the three cohorts, respectively. Adjusted HRs (CI) for all cancers comparing CCB, non-CCB and AHT cohorts were 0.88 (0.86 to 0.89) and 1.01 (0.98 to 1.04), respectively. Compared to the AHT cohort, adjusted HRs (CI) for breast, prostate and colon cancer for the CCB cohort were 0.95 (0.87 to 1.04), 1.07 (0.98 to 1.16) and 0.89 (0.81 to 0.98), respectively. Analyses by duration of exposure to CCB did not show excess risk. Conclusions: This large population-based study provides strong evidence that CCB use is not associated with an increased risk of cancer. The analyses yielded robust results across all types of cancer and different durations of exposure to CCBs.",

            "text": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a diverse group of medicines that are widely used to treat cardiovascular diseases including hypertension and angina. Antihypertensive (AHT) drugs are the most commonly prescribed class of medicines in the USA, with 97.9 million CCB prescriptions issued in that country during 2010; 1 in Europe, hypertension is one of the most common interventions in primary care, and CCBs are a first-line treatment for this. 2 However, it has been suggested that CCBs may interfere with apoptosis, leading to an increased potential for abnormal cell proliferation and tumour growth. 3 Epidemiological studies investigating the association between CCBs and cancer vary in terms of patients' characteristics, design, outcome variables and geographic location, the compound of which complicates assessment and synthesis of results across studies. While several studies showed an association between CCB use and an increased risk for all forms of cancer 4 5 and breast cancer, [6][7][8][9] others reported no risk. [10][11][12][13][14][15] Electronic healthcare databases used previously to investigate potential associations between CCB use and cancer can offer several advantages over primary data collection methods, particularly large sampling and limiting selection bias. 16 We used the Strengths and limitations of this study \u25aa This is a large-scale population-based study investigating differences in cancer risk between calcium channel blocker (CCB), non-CCB and non-CCB antihypertensive drugs users. \u25aa Extended analyses included specific cancer locations and cumulative length of exposure. \u25aa The study spanned a 14-year period (1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009) and required patients to have at least 2 years of follow-up data. \u25aa Exposure variables are unlikely to introduce bias considering physicians collected from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data while unaware of the hypothesis being tested in this analysis. \u25aa The results of this study might not apply directly to socially and ethnically diverse populations not included in the CPRD network of physicians, and generalisation therefore must be made cautiously.",

Exposure to the following AHT drugs was considered for inclusion into the AHT cohort: diuretics, \u03b2-blockers, ACE inhibitors, adrenergic neuron blockers, \u03b1-blockers, AHT vasodilators, centrally acting AHT drugs, angiotensin II antagonists and renin inhibitors.

Cox regression models were conducted to estimate the crude and multivariable adjusted relative risk by calculating HRs and 95% CIs of cancer in relation to drug exposure (ever vs never exposed). Potential confounding factors in the relation between cancer and CCB exposure were accounted for in multivariable regression models and included: age at index date and sex (matching variables in the comparison with the non-CCB cohort), smoking status, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, diabetes, hypertension, arrhythmia, angina, or heart failure, as well as the use of statins or aspirin. These factors were chosen based on previous findings linking the variables with an increased risk of cancer. For the AHT cohort, separate analyses were performed for colon cancer, breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men. Additional analyses were also conducted using the AHT cohort to account for switching drug exposure, with models stratified according to the duration of cumulative exposure to drugs (0-5, 5-10 and >10 years). All analyses were conducted using SAS software V.9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, North Carolina, USA).

This finding was consistent across all types of cancer, as well as for breast and prostate cancers. Patients exposed to CCBs were at lower risk of colon cancer than those exposed to other AHT drugs.

A repeated analysis using the same cohort, but a different inclusion criteria, found that the risk of developing cancer increased by approximately 1.7 times for CCB users compared with non-users. 4 Fitzpatrick et al 6 found a 2.6-fold increased risk for breast cancer in CCB users compared with non-CCB users in their study of 3198 women aged 65 years or older. In the majority of studies, the strength of this association appeared to be dependent on daily dosage or cumulative dose, ranging from no association in users of low dosages to a twofold (or possibly higher) increased risk when higher dosages were used. Our study found no difference in the strength of the association when considering the cumulative exposure to drugs over time; and an association was also not evident until at least 2-3 years after exposure. Furthermore, cancer risk was primarily highest for exposure to verapamil, 24 while no such relation was reported for diltiazem, and no consistent associations were shown for specific cancer sites or histological types. 25 However, in contrast to our study, a paper by Li et al 8 reported that the use of particular types of AHT medicines, including immediate-release CCBs and certain diuretics, was associated with a modest increased risk of breast cancer among 975 women aged 65-79 years.

Limitations of these studies included the use of self-reported exposure data 13 35 and lack of covariate information on relevant confounders, such as smoking, BMI and alcohol use. 10 31 32 34 Cohen et al 33 carried out three successive interviews in over 3500 individuals from North Carolina, USA, aged 65-105 years. After adjusting for baseline and time-dependent covariates such as race, diabetes, blood pressure, CCB dose, CCB class and length of follow-up, cancer risk was similar between CCB users and non-users. Our study differed from the study by Cohen et al 33 in several respects, notably, the ethnic diversity of our study population, the time period covered (more recent) and the definition of CCB user status (first-time users). Gonz\u00e1lez-P\u00e9rez et al 34 also used data from the CPRD to investigate the association between breast cancer and AHT drugs, specifically captopril, and also found that breast cancer incidence was similar for users and non-users. They also found that captopril was not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Trenkwalder et al 35 investigated the use of CCBs and incidence of fatal and non-fatal cancer in a 3-year follow-up study of over 1000 elderly patients. Similarly, they found that CCB use did not increase the risk of fatal or non-fatal cancer in their elderly central European population. The findings from the Danish cohort studies also agree with our findings related to specific cancer types. For example, the study by Fryzek et al, 10 including almost 50 000 Danish women, found no evidence that AHT drug use (including CCBs) was related to breast cancer. Olsen et al 31 reported no increased risk of colon cancer between CCB users as compared to non-users in a Danish study of almost 18 000 patients. Our findings differ from recently published findings by Li et al, 1 who found that long-term use of CCB was particularly associated with breast cancer.  ",

Extended analyses included specific cancer locations and cumulative length of exposure. Our study spanned a 14-year period (1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009) and required patients to have at least 2 years of follow-up data. The results of this study do not apply directly to populations not included in the CPRD network of physicians. However, this large, socially and ethnically diverse study population is likely to be representative of the British population, for the CPRD contains data from primary care practices across the whole of the UK. To maximise internal validity, we selected two different populations of CCB non-users for comparison. We hypothesised that patients exposed to AHT drugs other than CCBs represented the best choice; however, this population turned out to be much younger than that of CCB users. Multivariate analyses adjusted for these age differences, and other potential confounders for the association between cancer and CCB use, were performed. This was possible due to the breadth of information collected in the CPRD. Finally, exposure variables as recorded by physicians are unlikely to be biased because CPRD data has been shown to be valid and reliable, and collected while unaware of the hypothesis being tested in this analysis. 22 ",
