Recent application of deep-sequencing technologies has revealed that the transcription of asRNAs occurs genome-wide in bacteria. Although the role of the vast majority of asRNAs remains unknown, it is often assumed that their presence implies important regulatory functions, similar to those of other noncoding RNAs. Alternatively, many antisense transcripts may be produced by chance transcription events from promoter-like sequences that result from the degenerate nature of bacterial transcription factor binding sites. To investigate the biological relevance of antisense transcripts, we compared genome-wide patterns of asRNA expression in closely related enteric bacteria, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, by performing strand-specific transcriptome sequencing. Although antisense transcripts are abundant in both species, less than 3% of asRNAs are expressed at high levels in both species, and only about 14% appear to be conserved among species. And unlike the promoters of protein-coding genes, asRNA promoters show no evidence of sequence conservation between, or even within, species. Our findings suggest that many or even most bacterial asRNAs are nonadaptive by-products of the cell's transcription machinery. IMPORTANCE Application of high-throughput methods has revealed the expression throughout bacterial genomes of transcripts encoded on the strand complementary to protein-coding genes. Because transcription is costly, it is usually assumed that these transcripts, termed antisense RNAs (asRNAs), serve some function; however, the role of most asRNAs is unclear, raising questions about their relevance in cellular processes. Because natural selection conserves functional elements, comparisons between related species provide a method for assessing functionality genome-wide. Applying such an approach, we assayed all transcripts in two closely related bacteria, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and demonstrate that, although the levels of genome-wide antisense transcription are similarly high in both bacteria, only a small fraction of asRNAs are shared across species. Moreover, the promoters associated with asRNAs show no evidence of sequence conservation between, or even within, species. These findings indicate that despite the genome-wide transcription of asRNAs, many of these transcripts are likely nonfunctional.",

Many of the first bacterial asRNAs were shown to influence horizontally acquired elements by regulating bacteriophage gene expression, controlling plasmid and transposon copy number, and serving as antitoxins that promote plasmid retention (1)(2)(3)(4)(5). The recent application of deep-sequencing technologies has revealed that chromosomal antisense transcription is widespread in bacterial genomes (6)(7)(8). For example, in diverse bacterial lineages, such as Escherichia coli, Synechocystis, and Helicobacter pylori, between 20% and 50% of protein-coding genes have been found to encode asRNAs (9)(10)(11).",

To this end, we sequenced in parallel the transcriptomes of E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium and identified highly expressed transcripts arising from the opposite strand of protein-coding genes in each genome. Although antisense transcription is abundant in both species, only a small fraction of asRNAs are conserved across species, and the promoter elements associated with these transcripts show no evidence of purifying selection. The lack of evolutionary conservation between these two closely related enteric bacteria, combined with comparisons of strains within species, supports the view that many or even most of the asRNAs detected by deep-sequencing techniques are nonfunctional transcripts originating from spurious promoter-like sequences that arise nonadaptively throughout the genome.",

Among the 120 orthologous gene pairs with a highly expressed asRNA in either E. coli or Salmonella, only 8 (6.7%) showed high antisense expression in both species, and only 3 (2.5%) shared an identical antisense TSS position. Applying relaxed criteria that included any asRNA with a maximum read depth of at least 20 and an antisense TSS within 10 bp, we found that only 17 (14.2%) of the 120 gene pairs shared antisense expression at homologous positions in E. coli and Salmonella (Table 2).",

In such cases, only 26.9% of the homologous positions in E. coli and 31.5% in Salmonella had an identifiable \u03ea10 promoter element. Although these values are greatly reduced relative to the frequencies of \u03fe70% observed for expressed asRNAs, they still significantly exceed the expectation based on randomly chosen antisense positions (P \u03fd 0.05) ( Fig. 2). As expected, promoter elements were much less likely to be shared between E. coli and Salmonella if antisense expression was detected in only one of the species (37%) than if it was detected in both (90%) (P \u03ed 0.002, Fisher's exact test). Lack of purifying selection on antisense promoters. Patterns of DNA sequence divergence provide an effective tool for identifying sequences of functional importance. Such sequences typically experience purifying selection, meaning that most new mutations are deleterious and are therefore eliminated from the population. As a result, functional sequences show lower rates of sequence evolution than their nonfunctional counterparts. Promoters are necessary for the precise control of gene expression, and their sequences are typically under purifying selection and enriched in the regulatory regions of bacterial genomes (23)(24)(25). Accordingly, we found that the promoter regions for mRNAs exhibited reduced nucleotide divergence between E. coli and Salmonella relative to third codon position sites within protein-coding sequences. In particular, mRNA promoters exhibited pronounced reductions in divergence around the \u03ea35 and \u03ea10 elements, important functional regions that are involved in factor binding (Fig. 3A).",

The lack of conservation in asRNAs between these species might be taken to indicate that asRNAs function largely in a species-specific manner; however, we found no evidence of conservation or functional constraint acting within the genus Escherichia or even among different strains of E. coli (Fig. 3). Therefore, we suggest the alternative interpretation that a large fraction of antisense expression in bacterial genomes is nonfunctional. Promoter-like sequences are expected to arise spontaneously by point mutations over short evolutionary time scales in bacterial genomes because of the low information content in 70 transcription factor binding sites (16,26). The underrepresentation of transcription factor binding motifs in bacterial genomes indicates that selection acts to purge spurious promoters (23,24,27). However, Hahn et al. (27) found that the average intensity of selection against such elements is weak, falling well within the range of \"nearly neutral\" mutations, where the effects of genetic drift begin to overwhelm the strength of selection (28,29). Consequently, many spurious promoter-like sequences are expected to persist within populations and even reach fixation based purely on nonadaptive mechanisms of mutation and drift.",

In contrast to the situation in B. subtilis, we found asRNA expression in E. coli and Salmonella to be predominantly controlled by the housekeeping 70 factor, consistent with expectations given our sampling at log-phase growing conditions. It is possible that our analysis captured only a fraction of potential antisense expression, which could account for the limited overlap observed between the sets of asRNAs reported in different studies of E. coli (see Table S5 in the supplemental material). The sensitivity of spurious transcription events to minor environmental differences may also explain why antisense TSS positions are weakly but significantly enriched in promoter-like sequences, even in species for which we found no expression of the corresponding asRNA.",

The \u03ea10 element is particularly indispensable and has a core sequence with the 6-bp consensus TATAAT (43,44). This motif is highly degenerate, however, since promoter elements often have imperfect matches to the consensus and can be located anywhere in a window ranging from approximately 4 to 18 bp upstream of the TSS (44). Therefore, to identify potential \u03ea10 elements associated with antisense TSSs, we searched this 15-bp window for any hexamers that matched at least 4 of the 6 bp in the consensus sequence including the two most highly conserved positions, A2 and T6 (23). This approach could potentially miss some legitimate \u03ea10 elements because many documented promoters are too divergent to satisfy these criteria (45).",
