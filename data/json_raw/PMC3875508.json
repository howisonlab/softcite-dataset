Materials and Methods: Six 3D finite element models were created to replicate two different implant systems with peri-implant bone tissue, in which six different implantabutment configurations were represented: model XiVE-a: 3.8-mm-diameter implant and 3.8-mm-diameter abutment; model XiVE-b (platform-switching model): 4.5-mm-diameter implant and 3.8-mm-diameter abutment; model XiVE-c: 4.5-mm-diameter implant and 4.5-mm-diameter abutment; model 3i-a: 4.0-mm-diameter implant and 4.1-mm-diameter abutment; model 3i-b (platform-switching model): 5.0-mm-diameter implant and 4.1-mmdiameter abutment; model 3i-c: 5.0-mm-diameter implant and 5.0-mm-diameter abutment. vertical and oblique loads of 100 were applied to all models. Results: While the pattern of stress distribution was similar for both loading situations, oblique loading resulted in higher intensity and greater distribution of stress than axial loading in both cortical bone and implant-abutment-interface. Stress distribution at periimplant bone was almost identical with similar magnitudes for all six models. In both implant systems, platform-switching models demonstrated lower maximum von Mises stress in cortical bone than conventional models. However, in both implant systems and under both loading situations, platform-switching models showed higher stresses at the implantabutment interface than conventional models. Conclusion: In both implant systems, platform switching design reduced the stress concentration in the crestal bone and shifted it towards the area of implant-abutment interface."

            "text": "In recent years, several investigations have been carried out in order to explain the changes observed in crestal bone height. Location of the implant-abutment junction (IAJ) in relation to crestal bone [6][7][8], the bacterial colonization of the micro-gap at the IAJ [9], the establishment of a biological width or mucosal barrier around dental implants [1,[10][11][12] and the stress-strain concentration due to occlusal loading [13][14][15][16][17] are among factors that have been suggested as the most likely causes of these crestal bone-level changes. Although this 1.5-2.0 mm of bone resorption is still clinically acceptable [18], the ability to reduce this crestal bone loss may have several advantages such as improved esthetics, higher bone to implant contact and better primary stability. [1,2,19]. In order to minimize this crestal bone resorption, several techniques and procedures such as non-submerged technique [20,21], utilizing micro-roughness on implant neck surface [22] and platform switching [23] have recently been developed. The concept of platform switching was introduced by Lazzara and Porter, and refers to the use of a smaller-diameter abutment on a larger-diameter implant collar [23]. Through placement of the smaller prosthetic components on the implant platform, IAJ is moved inward from the implant shoulder and further away from the crestal bone [19,23,24]. Hypothetically, platform switching may increase the distance between the inflammatory cell infiltrate and the adjacent alveolar crest that can limit crestal bone resorption around the restored two-piece implants [25]. The results of several histomorphometric studies showed that platform switching can significantly help to maintain the peri-implant soft and hard tissue and may be especially beneficial in esthetically demanding locations that require strong soft tissue support [25][26][27][28][29]. In the past two decades, finite element analysis (FEA) has become an increasingly useful tool for prediction of the effects of stress on the implant and its surrounding bone, and has been used extensively in describing biomechanical performance of dental implant systems [30]. However, excessive simplifications of geometry will result in considerable inaccu-racy in FEA results. To produce more accurate geometries, some methods starting from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance data of actual human bones have been proposed [11]. Several studies on platform switching, using three-dimensional (3D) finite element models, reported the biomechanical advantage of shifting stress concentration area away from the cervical bone implant interface [31][32][33][34]. Some FEA studies, on the other hand, showed that platform switching may have a minimal effect on von-Mises stress in the crestal region of the cortical bone [35]. Interestingly, a new FEA investigation about platform switching demonstrated that the reduction in bone strain was mostly caused by increasing the diameter of the implant, instead of using the platform switching technique [36].",

In addition, some studies reported that the concentration of stress is greater around immediately loaded implants than around delay-loaded implants [26,27]. The present study also indicated that in both implant systems, the compressive and tensile stresses were lower in platform-switching models than conventional models at the compact bone in the vicinity of the implant neck.  Table 2). To construct a finite element model, it is usually necessary to simplify the system by making some assumptions. The implants and bone used in the models were considered to be isotropic, homogeneous and linearly elastic and the occlusal forces were static. Furthermore, in the present study, the bone-implant contact was 100%, but in vivo, bone-implant contact percentages usually range from 30% to 70%. Thus, the final models represented an average clinical situation, and generalization of its results should be done with care. Therefore, because the finite element models used in this study do not identically reproduce all clinical situations, the application of the results should be tempered with sound clinical judgment.",
