            "text": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder caused by anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR-Abs) or other etiologies. Ocular symptoms were the first presentations in 40-50% of MG patients. Ptosis and diplopia were the most common symptoms of ocular MG (OMG). Limited studies demonstrated that patients presented with initial symptoms of only ptosis in 47%, only diplopia in 14% and both ptosis and diplopia in 39% of OMG. [1] Variations of diplopia or ptosis did not significantly affect the physical or mental status of OMG. Initial presentation of concurrent ptosis and diplopia was significantly associated with insensitivity to pyridostigmine for OMG patients. However, the differences of clinical features including age of disease onset, gender, thymoma, as well as other autoimmune disease between various phenotypes of OMG remain unidentified.",

[2,3] Early thymectomy and administration of prednisolone can decrease relapse and secondary generalization of OMG. Late age of onset, anti-AChR-Ab, and thymoma increased the risk of secondary generalization. Anti-Kv1.4 antibody and thymus hyperplasia increased MG relapse. Time of diagnosis from onset and age at onset (\u226440 years) predicted MG remission. Gender does not seem to predict the course of MG. However, less attention was paid on the effect of initial OMG symptoms of disease onset such as ptosis and diplopia concurrence or alone, ptosis on one or both eyes on both MG relapse and OMG second generalization.
