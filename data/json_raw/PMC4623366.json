Targeting BAFF may not be a viable therapeutic approach. signalling. 1 Dysregulated BAFF expression contributes to autoimmunity primarily via effects on survival of immature and transitional B cells and the resulting failure to eliminate self-reactive B cells. Conversely, blocking BAFF has been shown to reverse autoimmune disease in animal models. 2 3 Furthermore, many patients with RA have elevated BAFF in blood and synovial fluid. 3 4 Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are a part of the standard of care to treat RA, including the class of biologics (bDMARDs) that target tumour necrosis factor (TNF). 5 Though numerous RA therapies are currently available, 20-50% of patients do not achieve significant clinical improvement, [6][7][8][9][10][11][12] or they fail to maintain efficacy after initial therapeutic benefit. 13 Thus, new treatment options for RA are needed.",

A separate phase 2 tabalumab study of patients with inadequate response to methotrexate, which also applied intravenous administration and the same dosing frequency, demonstrated that all tabalumab doses were significantly more effective than placebo through week 24. 15 It is notable that clinical efficacy corresponded to peak drug concentrations following infusion of tabalumab.",

The efficacy of tabalumab in special patient subgroups (eg, prior prednisolone use, smoking status, RF/anti-CCP seropositivity status and number of previous TNF inhibitor treatment failures), was inconclusive because data were insufficient due to early termination of the trial. The findings in this study corroborate preliminary reported data from other BAFF inhibitor trials in patients with RA showing a lack of significant efficacy 18 or efficacy that was restricted to a bDMARD-na\u00efve subgroup. 19 Despite the lack of efficacy, the biological activity of tabalumab was confirmed, but did not differ between the 2 dosing regimens in all parameters tested. Over the 24-week treatment period, CD20+ B-cells initially increased then gradually and significantly declined in response to tabalumab but not placebo administration, and without total B-cell depletion. This was expected, based on the mechanism of action of tabalumab: binding and neutralising BAFF, 14 an essential B-cell survival signal, and has also been reported for other BAFF/B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) inhibiting agents (belimumab, atacicept). 20 Notably, these other BAFF blocking agents also showed a lack of correlation between different dosages and biomarker changes. 21 22 In the current study, B-cell decline correlated with significant decreases in circulating IgA, IgG and IgM levels after tabalumab treatment. Despite decreases in biological parameters, there was no difference in infection rates for either tabalumab group compared with placebo. Tabalumab treatment was associated with a low incidence of ADA, and there was no association between treatment-emergent ADA and any reports of AEs.",

[15][16][17] Compared with prior phase 3 studies of other biological therapies in patients with RA, the present study of tabalumab had a similar incidence of TEAEs (range: 51.7-59.5%), discontinuations due to TEAEs (range: 2.6-2.7%), infections (range: 23.5-25.9%) and SAEs (range: 3.9-4.6%). 6 23-26 There were limitations to the design and interpretation of results of this study, which was terminated early. The effects of background DMARD treatment, and prior and concomitant RA medications, may limit interpretation of results. In addition, patients were previously treated with 1 or more TNF inhibitors and had discontinued due to treatment failure or intolerance; there may be patients in this population who are refractory to immunomodulatory biological therapy for RA, including tabalumab. In this phase 3 study in patients with previous failure of biological therapy, tabalumab did not demonstrate clinical efficacy in either dosing regimen, despite evidence of biological activity. Targeting BAFF may not be a viable therapeutic approach. Alternatively, the dose of active study drug and/or duration of the study may not have been optimal to observe a clinical effect.
