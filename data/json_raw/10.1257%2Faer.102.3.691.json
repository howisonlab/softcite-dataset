            "text": "The major new initiative of the Committee in 2011 was to launch an annual conference on teaching economics at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and research on economic education at all levels (including precollege). The first conference was an outstanding success, held June 1-3, 2011, at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. Plenary sessions featured Vernon Smith (Chapman), John Taylor (Stanford), and Douglas Bernheim (Stanford), with a dinner and fourth plenary session by John Williams at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. There were 55 papers presented in concurrent sessions, plus six panel discussions and four workshops on teaching or research. Registrations were received from 174 individuals, including 20 from international participants from 10 different countries. The second annual conference will be held in Boston from May 30-June 1, 2012, featuring plenary sessions by Daron Acemoglu (MIT), Susan Athey (Harvard), Peter Diamond (MIT), Gregory Mankiw (Harvard), and a dinner and fifth plenary session by Jeffry Fuhrer at the Boston Federal Reserve Bank.",

A final report on the Stanford conference was provided to the Executive Committee for its January 2012 meeting, and a slightly modified version of that report will be published in JEE in 2012, titled \"Changing the Landscape of Economic Education.\"",

As a follow-up to the TIP project the Committee supported a proposal for a daylong \"continuing education\" session on the interactive teaching of economics at the January 2012 meetings of AEA in Chicago. That proposal was accepted, and the session will be conducted by Michael Salemi, William Walstad, KimMarie McGoldrick (Richmond), Tisha Emerson (Baylor), and Pat Conway (North Carolina).",

The \"creativity workshop\" featured in this project was directed by David Colander (Middlebury), John Siegfried (Vanderbilt), and Avinash Dixit (Princeton). In the second Teagle extension project KimMarie McGoldrick (Richmond) and Robert Garnett (Texas Christian) developed two modules, one in microeconomics and one in macroeconomics, demonstrating how to teach enduring \"big think\" questions. Two manuscripts have been prepared describing the modules and the development process for the modules.",

The modules were developed by William Becker (Indiana), with William Greene (NYU) and John Siegfried (Vanderbilt) contributing on two modules. The modules deal with heteroskedasticity; endogenous regressors with natural experiments, instrumental variables, and two-stage estimators; panel data; and sample selection issues. Each module features \"real-world\" datasets and sample programs written in Stata, SAS, and Limdep. Information on website \"hits\" is now available for the period corresponding to the 2011 \"spring semester\" at most US schools, from January-May 2011. The monthly average over this period was 220 hits/ views, with more hits in early and middle months of the \"term.\" It appears (as supported by anecdotal accounts) that the modules and datasets are being used in many econometrics classes as general teaching tools, not just to introduce research topics in economic education.",

A presentation on this project was included in the Committee's annual poster session at the Chicago meetings in January 2012.",
