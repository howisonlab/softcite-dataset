Empirically, this specification dominates the standard model because it is consistent with the square root volatility found in macroeconomic time series. Thus it establishes an important connection between the stochastic volatility of the mainstream finance model and macroeconomic volatility of the Okun-Friedman type. This research opens the way to a richer specification of both macroeconomic and term structure models, incorporating the best features of both macro-finance and mainstream finance models."

As the name suggests the macro-finance approach allows bond yields to reflect macro-economic variables as well as latent variables representing financial market factors. It is based on the central bank model (CBM) developed by Svensson (1999), Rudebusch (2002), Smets (1999), Kozicki and Tinsley (2005), and others, which represents the behavior of the macroeconomy in terms of the output gap (g t ), inflation (\u03c0 t ) and the short-term interest rate (r t ). The model developed in this paper allows bond yields to reflect changes in macro-economic volatility related to the underlying rate of inflation.",

In particular, early macro-finance studies showed that although macro-economic variables provide a good description of the behavior of short rates they do not provide an adequate description of long-term yields Tinsley 2001, Ang andPiazzesi 2003). This finding has spawned an important macro-econometric literature that augments the CBM with latent variables, capturing exogenous changes in inflation and interest rates (Kozicki and Tinsley 2005 provide a useful summary). This literature shows that these rates are characterized by a nonstationary common trend (or unit root) that seems to be explained by the underlying rate of inflation. It follows the standard macroeconometric literature in assuming a homoskedastic (fixed) variance structure. This situation is familiar to macro-economic modelers but poses a potential problem for term structure researchers: it is well known that asymptotic (long-maturity) yields are not properly defined if the interest rate is driven by a random walk (a homoskedastic unit root process).",

Table 1 shows the means, standard deviations, and first-order autocorrelation coefficients of these data, as well as KPSS (Kwiatowski et al. 1992) and adjusted Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test results. The ADF tests show that the null hypothesis of nonstationarity for these variables cannot be rejected at the 5% level. The KPSS statistics for inflation and 1-to 10-year interest rates are only significant at the 10% level, suggesting that the null hypothesis of stationarity may just be acceptable. However, the KPSS statistic for the 15-year rate is almost significant at the 5% level. Moreover, Fama (2006) argues persuasively that the long upswing and downswing in rates evident in the figures was the result of a succession of permanent shocks that were on balance positive until 1981 and negative thereafter. In this paper, I follow Kozicki and Tinsley (2005), , and Fama (2006) in analyzing a macro-econometric model characterized by a unit root.",

The unit root EA 0 (11) specification M0 is also nested in M2, employing six restrictions: \u03b4 11 and 1 (4) are set to zero and again \u03be 1 = 1. However, its log-likelihood of L(0) = 678.2 is much lower than for the other models and it is overwhelmingly rejected against M2. This rejection is largely due to the restriction \u03b4 11 = 0. The effect of this is twofold: (i) it makes the stochastic trend homoskedastic and (ii) it removes the nonlinearity from (18), reducing it to the linear recursion (21). Theoretically, these two effects are inextricably related because the parameters of the stochastic structure structure(\u03b4 01 , \u03b4 11 , 0 , 1 , and C 22 ) are not affected by the change of measure and the conventional macro-finance assumption is that they are the same in the macro-and yield models. However further relaxing this assumption allows (i) and (ii) to be separated."

Comparing its log-likelihood L(3) with that L(0) of M0 which it nests, gives an estimate of effect (i) of heteroskedasticity in the macroeconomy. This is highly significant.

The novelty here is the introduction of the square root volatility effects implied by the CIR-based term structure model. The model is driven by a nominal factor x 1,t and a real factor x 2,t . Model estimates of these factors are shown in Figure 4, along with their 95% confidence intervals. Most of the work is done by the nominal factor, which has a unit root. Since x 1,t has a noncentral chi-square distribution, the downside variance is smaller than the upside, but this asymmetry is only apparent at the beginning of the estimation period when the underlying inflation rate is low. This variable drives the conditional heteroskedasticity in the macro-variables. Their one-quarter-ahead forecasts values and 95% confidence intervals are shown in Figure 5. The effect of heteroskedasticity is particularly pronounced in the case of the spot rate, consistent with the finding in univariate models (Chen et al. 1992, Ait-Sahalia 1996, Stanton 1997. Its variance is low over the first 4 years of the estimation period, consistent with the ex post stability of interest rates over this period 2219.6 ( \u2212) (0.87) ( Figure 5c). The behavior of the spot rate over the medium term is also influenced by the real factor x 2,t , as is clear from a comparison with Figure 4(b). As expected, this real interest series reveals a marked tightening of monetary policy in the late 1970s, with a very relaxed stance in the early 1990s and again post-millennium. The model attributes the ultra-low interest rates seen over the early years of the millennium to a relaxation of monetary policy, coming against a background of a low underlying inflation rate.",

Four pairs of roots are sinusoidal, reflecting the cyclical nature of the macro-economic data. 13 These cyclical effects are seen more clearly in the impulse responses, which show the dynamic effects of innovations in the macro-economic variables on the system. Because these innovations are correlated empirically, we work with orthogonalized innovations using the triangular factorization defined in (A1). The orthogonalized impulse responses show the effect on the macro-economic system of increasing each of these shocks by 1 percentage point for just one period using the Wold representation of the system. This arrangement is affected by the ordering of the macro-economic variables in the vector x t . Like Kozicki and Tinsley (2005), I adopt the standard ordering: x t = {y \u03c0 * ,t , y r * ,t , g t , \u03c0 t , r 1,t }. The first shock (\u03c5 1 ) reflects permanent policy or expectational changes in the inflation asymptote while the second (\u03c5 2 ) reflects structural shocks to the real interest rate. Conventionally, \u03c5 3 is interpreted as a positive demand shock and (\u03c5 4 ) as a negative supply shock. Finally, (\u03c5 5 ) represents transitory changes in monetary policy. Figure 6 shows the results of this exercise. This gives a plausible description of the macro-economic dynamics. As in the model of Kozicki and Tinsley (2005), the use of Kalman filters to pick up the effect of unobservable expectational influences seems to solve the notorious price puzzle-the tendency (noted originally by Sims 1992) for increases in policy interest rates to anticipate inflationary developments and apparently cause inflation. The nominal filter dictates the long-run equilibrium of the macroeconomy (and its volatility). These effects are persistent, but the responses of the macro-economic variables to surprises in inflation, output, and interest rates are rapid. They are largely exponential in nature, suggesting that monetary policy has been effective in securing its objectives quickly, without significant policy reversals or cycles. These results are reflected in Figure 7, which report the results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) exercise. These figures show the share of the total variance attributable to the innovations at different lag lengths and are also obtained using the Wold representation of the system, as described in Cochrane (1997). They indicate the contribution each innovation would make to the volatility of each model variable if the error process was suddenly started (having been dormant previously). So, for example, we see that the output surprise \u03b7 1,t accounts for nearly all of the short-run volatility in output, with similar results for the responses of inflation and spot rates to their own innovations. However, the effect of other innovations builds up over time.",

The spot rate loadings decline over the next few years, reflecting the adjustment of the spot rate toward x 1,t and x 2,t . The spot rate thus determines the slope of the short-term yield curve. Three-to 5-year maturity yields are strongly influenced by the behavior of the real rate factor x 2,t . The loading on this factor then fades gradually over the longer maturities, allowing this to act as a \"curvature\" factor. In contrast, the loading upon x 1,t moves up to unity and then increases gradually with maturity over the 2-to 15-year maturity range, so that it acts as a \"level\" factor. The loadings for output and inflation have a humped shape, but are relatively small.   Figure 9 shows the risk premia implied by models M0 and M1 for the 15-year yield. Although the loadings for these models are similar, the risk premia differ because they also depend upon the way that the stochastic trend affects volatility (via \u03bb 10 in M1) and the price of risk (\u03bb 11 in M0). The parameter \u03bb 10 is significantly negative in M1, so the stochastic trend has a positive effect on the asymptotic risk premium in that model (Appendix B). In M0, \u03bb 11 adopts a positive value in order to keep the model dynamics stable under Q, so the stochastic trend has a negative effect on the asymptotic premium. This means that although the stochastic trend has a positive effect on the 15-year premia in both models, this is more powerful in M1 than it is in M0. The real factor also has a strong positive effect in both models, as is clear from the figure. The effect of the macro-economic variables on the risk premia in these models is relatively small in the 15-year area. The impulse responses for the 5-year yield and ANOVA results for the 10-year yield are shown in Figures 6 and 7. These reflect the combined effect of the factor loadings and the dynamic characteristics of the model variables discussed in the previous section. The behavior of the 5-year yield depends upon the spot rate and the financial factors. The variance of the 10-year yield ( Figure  7) is dominated by the shocks to the two financial factors, reflecting the \"level\" and \"curvature\" effects. The effect of the spot rate and other macro-economic variables is negligible at this maturity.

This means that the trend affects the steady state inflation and spot rates without disturbing the asymptotic forward rate. The model was initially designed to tackle the asymptotic problem posed by the unit root, but in practice it seems that its superior performance stems from its ability to NOTES: Each panel shows the effect of a shock to one the five orthogonal innovations (\u03b5, \u03b7) shown in (1) and (2).

However, 30 year issuance has now resumed and the growing demand from pension providers is likely to keep this funding window open. Moreover, the increasing number of 50-year issues in the U.K. and French Treasury markets should generate data better suited to an empirical test of asymptotic model behavior.

In contrast to the volatility-clustering effects implied by GARCH macro-models, this conditional heteroskedasticity is persistent, exhibiting a unit root. Mathematically, it is more tractable than the GARCH model, generating linear structures that could lend themselves not just to research on the term structure but to optimal control and similar intertemporal optimization problems. Empirically, this finding helps to explain the \"Great Moderation\"-the fall in output, interest rate, and inflation volatility seen since the mid 1980s (Bernanke 2004, Kim, Nelson, andPiger 2004)-attributing it to the fall in the inflation trend associated with the recession of the early 1980s. It reminds us that this so-called moderation is actually a return to the low-inflation, low-volatility epoch that characterized the early postwar years. The \"general affine\" macro-model A 1 helps to explain both the rise and subsequent fall in volatility.",

It can also use an unrestricted specification of the price of risk, with a large number of parameters. It is particularly informative about the stochastic volatility parameters, identifying these with the volatility parameters of the macro-model, which are well determined. The relative adjustment speeds mean that the behavior of the yield curve is largely dictated by three factors: the inflation end-point, the real interest rate factor, and the spot rate. The model is consistent with the traditional three-factor finance specification in this sense but links these factors to the behavior of the macroeconomy. This research opens the way to new CBM-based studies of monetary policy and a much richer term structure specification, incorporating the best features of both macro-finance and mainstream finance models."

B13Recall that this model requires the restriction \u03bb 11 > 0. This means that the associated factor risk premium (the asymptotic premium) is negatively related to the inflation trend. This premium is shown by \u03b4 01 (\u03bb 10 + \u03bb 11 x 1,t ) in the second term. In practice, this effect has the effect of offsetting the effect of the component 2,\u03c4 \u22121 \u03d2 0 x 1,t shown in the first term (which is positive in the empirical model). Thus, the influence of the trend on the premia shown in Figure 9 is more pronounced in model M1.",

            "text": "This shows that the asymptotic behavior of the forward rate depends critically upon whether the slope coefficients converge to constants. If so, the last term vanishes and \u03b3 \u03c4 +1 and hence the forward rate asymptote ( f * t ) is constant. Since * 2 = lim \u03c4 \u2192\u221e 2,\u03c4 = (I \u2212 ( Q 22 ) ) \u22121 J 2,r is constant, this just depends upon the behavior \u03c8 1,\u03c4 . Table 3 shows the asymptotic effect on the yield model of imposing unit root restrictions (\u03be Q i 1 = 1; \u03b8 Q i 1 = 0) on x 1,t under Q. In EA 1 , \u03c8 1,\u03c4 asymptotes to a constant, so \u03b2 * 1 and f * are zero. However, (21) shows that in EA 0 : lim \u03c4 \u2192\u221e (\u03c8 1,\u03c4 +1 \u2212 \u03c8 1,\u03c4 ) = Q 0 21 * 2 = Q 0 21 (I \u2212 ( Q 22 ) ) \u22121 J 2,r . Consequently, \u03b2 * 1 = lim \u03c4 \u2192\u221e \u03c8 1,\u03c4 /\u03c4 = Q 0 21 (I \u2212 ( Q 22 ) ) \u22121 J 2,r . This expression is equal to the asymptotic effect of x 1,t on r 1,t under Q and as such it should be close to unity. Substituting these coefficients into (22) and (B14) gives the asymptotic behavior of the forward rate reported in Table 3. The final term in this expression is the Jensen effect associated with \u03c8 1,\u03c4 x 1,t , which behaves like (\u2212) 1 2 \u03b4 01 \u03b2 * 2 1 \u03c4 2 in the limit. These results illustrate the basic theorem of Dybvig, Ingersoll, and Ross (1996), which says that in an arbitrage-free framework \"the limiting forward interest rate, if it exists, can never fall.\" In other words the forward rate must either fail to converge with maturity (as in the unit root EA 0 model), or must asymptote to a constant (EA 1 ).",
