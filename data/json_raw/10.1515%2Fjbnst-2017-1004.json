Since in many cases the required information resides in different organizations, for many applications, a central linkage unit is needed as trusted third party. Because of the federal structure of Germany and the strict data protection jurisdiction, the legal requirements for a linkage operation have to be negotiated for each project separately. Due to this obstacle, no general purpose central linking unit has been available in Germany.",

They were awarded with this research grant in 2011 to establish the first academic data linkage facility in Germany. 1 The focus of the group in Duisburg was research and development of record linkage methods, while the group at the IAB primarily provided services like consulting of and conducting record linkages commissioned by academic institutions. The main goal of the GRLC was to increase the number of record linkage applications using administrative data, especially within -but not limited to -the social sciences. Furthermore, GRLC aimed for internationally leading research in record-linkage methodology.",

The choice of these blocks is an active field of research within record-linkage (Christen, 2012). The current recommendation (Schnell, 2015) for linking with encrypted identifiers are multibit-trees (Kristensen et al., 2010) with additional encrypted identifiers such as year of birth as blocking variable. Combing external blocks such as year of birth with multi-bit trees allows for privacy preserving linkage of two census scale data sets within a few hours (Schnell, 2014a). For most applications, this solution is sufficient with regard to speed, accuracy and privacy (Brown et al., 2017). Therefore, this combination is provided with the record-linkage software of the GRLC (see Section 2.2).",

Although not one real-world attack on research data bases has been reported in the scientific literature (Emam et al., 2011), academic research focuses on attacks within the linkage unit. Therefore, the resilience of PPRL encodings against all known cryptographic attacks is widely considered as essential for the successful imple-Brought to you by | The University of Texas at Austin Authenticated Download Date | 3/30/18 6:48 PM mentation of PPRL protocols. It has to be noted that the accepted practice of record linkage within cancer registries in Germany would fail these criteria. This is due to the fact that a simple alignment of the most frequent names and the most frequent encoded names would identify at least some records (Domingo-Ferrer and Muralidhar, 2016). Therefore, research on privacy within the GRLC concentrated on technical measures to prevent these kinds of attacks (Niedermeyer et al., 2014;Schnell and Borgs, 2016). The currently recommended parameter settings (Christen et al., 2017) yield encryptions which can not be successfully attacked by any known method.

Due to the federal structure, most databases are scattered across the federal states (Bundesl\u00e4nder). Therefore, only the registries of social security administrations have regularly been used as population covering databases. 2 Due to the lack of actual regular data linkages across different federal states or across different organizations, data custodians often reject research proposals since no prototype for such linkages exist in Germany. The Duisburg group of the GRLC therefore tried to implement such a prototype for more than a decade.",

Since about 110,000 newborns are assigned to further medical treatment, additional data ('neonatal data') is available for these cases. These two datasets are linked nationwide. However, about 20% of the records can not be linked due to the lack of information to discriminate between similar records . The organization responsible for this linkage is a federal institution, the Federal Joint Committee ('Gemeinsamer Bundesverband', GBA). 3 Hence it has been suggested by a technical working group consisting of medical, mathematical and record linkage experts to include more information, for example an encrypted version of the name of the mother to the two datasets . As researchers of the Federal Institute for Data Security (BSI) have been involved in the proposal, it has been adopted by the GBA (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, 2015). The Duisburg group of the GRLC is involved in the technical implementation of the procedure (Meier et al., 2017). This implementation will be the first population covering record linkage in Germany using modern methods of PPRL.",

In 2017, IPDLN started its own journal, the International Journal of Population Data Science (IJPDS). The journal's first issue contains the conference proceedings of the IPDLN conference in 2016 and contains four extended abstracts of presentations by members of the GRLC. In 2016, a British group initiated a six month workshop at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Studies in Cambridge, to which international researchers in record linkage methodology were invited. During this workshop, members of GRLC started cooperations with record-linkage research groups in Vancouver, Canberra and Perth. GRLC applied for research grants with all three groups. Due to this collaborative efforts, two joint papers have been published so far (Brown et al., 2017;Christen et al., 2017).",
