Since in many cases the required information resides in different organizations, for many applications, a central linkage unit is needed as trusted third party. Because of the federal structure of Germany and the strict data protection jurisdiction, the legal requirements for a linkage operation have to be negotiated for each project separately. Due to this obstacle, no general purpose central linking unit has been available in Germany.",

They were awarded with this research grant in 2011 to establish the first academic data linkage facility in Germany. 1 The focus of the group in Duisburg was research and development of record linkage methods, while the group at the IAB primarily provided services like consulting of and conducting record linkages commissioned by academic institutions. The main goal of the GRLC was to increase the number of record linkage applications using administrative data, especially within -but not limited to -the social sciences. Furthermore, GRLC aimed for internationally leading research in record-linkage methodology.",

The choice of these blocks is an active field of research within record-linkage (Christen, 2012). The current recommendation (Schnell, 2015) for linking with encrypted identifiers are multibit-trees (Kristensen et al., 2010) with additional encrypted identifiers such as year of birth as blocking variable. Combing external blocks such as year of birth with multi-bit trees allows for privacy preserving linkage of two census scale data sets within a few hours (Schnell, 2014a). For most applications, this solution is sufficient with regard to speed, accuracy and privacy (Brown et al., 2017). Therefore, this combination is provided with the record-linkage software of the GRLC (see Section 2.2).",

Therefore, the resilience of PPRL encodings against all known cryptographic attacks is widely considered as essential for the successful imple-Brought to you by | The University of Texas at Austin Authenticated Download Date | 3/30/18 6:48 PM mentation of PPRL protocols. It has to be noted that the accepted practice of record linkage within cancer registries in Germany would fail these criteria. This is due to the fact that a simple alignment of the most frequent names and the most frequent encoded names would identify at least some records (Domingo-Ferrer and Muralidhar, 2016). Therefore, research on privacy within the GRLC concentrated on technical measures to prevent these kinds of attacks (Niedermeyer et al., 2014;Schnell and Borgs, 2016). The currently recommended parameter settings (Christen et al., 2017) yield encryptions which can not be successfully attacked by any known method.

However, about 20% of the records can not be linked due to the lack of information to discriminate between similar records . The organization responsible for this linkage is a federal institution, the Federal Joint Committee ('Gemeinsamer Bundesverband', GBA). 3 Hence it has been suggested by a technical working group consisting of medical, mathematical and record linkage experts to include more information, for example an encrypted version of the name of the mother to the two datasets . As researchers of the Federal Institute for Data Security (BSI) have been involved in the proposal, it has been adopted by the GBA (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, 2015).

Researchers have begun to meet on international conferences on record linkage and established a first international organization, the International Population Data Linkage Network (IPDLN). GRLC has been one of the earliest institutional members of this group and attended all conferences organized by IPDLN. In 2017, IPDLN started its own journal, the International Journal of Population Data Science (IJPDS). The journal's first issue contains the conference proceedings of the IPDLN conference in 2016 and contains four extended abstracts of presentations by members of the GRLC. In 2016, a British group initiated a six month workshop at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Studies in Cambridge, to which international researchers in record linkage methodology were invited. During this workshop, members of GRLC started cooperations with record-linkage research groups in Vancouver, Canberra and Perth. GRLC applied for research grants with all three groups. Due to this collaborative efforts, two joint papers have been published so far (Brown et al., 2017;Christen et al., 2017).",

We thus encourage potential scientific clients or cooperation partners to contact the GRLC to discuss the feasibility of any linkage ideas. 4 Due to administrative constraints of the GRLC hosting institutions, any linkage project will have to cover personnel and overhead costs of GRLC staff for at least three months full-time equivalent. Even if these financial requirements are fulfilled, a requested linkage project has to be declined by the GRLC if not all legal requirements for a linkage are met.

Some of the underlying linkage operations were done by members of the GRLC, some by staff of the FDZ after consulting the GRLC.

As described above, data access of researchers that own all elements of the linked data is not affected by data linkage. In such cases, linked data can be stored and accessed within any environment permissible for the underlying data.

Therefore, research on these techniques will also increase (Schnell et al., 2017). The recently founded International Journal of Population Data Science (IJPDS) will facilitate the publication of research on data linkage. This ever more favorable research climate for linkage will yield more and more requests for linkage solutions.
