We need to have a better understanding of the predation-risk behavioral responses toward prey. This research examined prey choices by Toxorhynchites splendens by monitoring the behavioral responses of Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Anopheles sinensis larvae when exposed to the predator. The results show that Tx. splendens prefers to consume Ae. aegypti larvae. The larvae exhibited different behavioral responses when Tx. splendens was present which suggest vulnerability in the presence of predators. \"Thrashing\" and \"browsing\" activities were greater in Ae. aegypti larvae. Such active and risky movements could cause vulnerability for the Ae. aegypti larvae due to increasing of water disturbance. In contrast, Ae. albopictus and An. sinensis larvae exhibited passive, low-risk behaviors, spending most of the time on the \"wall\" position near the edges of the container. We postulated that Ae. aegypti has less ability to perceive cues from predation and could not successfully alter its behavior to reduce risk of predation risk compared with Ae. albopictus and An. sinensis. Our results suggest that Tx. splendens is a suitable biocontrol agent in controlling dengue hemorrhagic vector, Ae. aegypti.",

These cases are linked to the spread of vector Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Monath 1994, Gubler andMeltzer 1999). Three main mosquito vectors in Malaysia are Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, which are associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue fever, whereas An. sinensis is for malaria.",

Several biocontrol agents had been tested to control mosquito populations in Malaysia, ranging from the order Diptera, Odonata, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera (Shaalan and Canyon 2009). In Malaysia, Toxorhynchites predatory larva is one of the preferred choices as a biological control agent attributable to sharing same habitat with mosquito prey. Toxorhynchites and mosquito larvae, e.g., Ae. albopictus and Ae. Aegypti, frequently coexisted together and share the same habitat in common aquatic ecosystem (Steffan andEvenhuis 1981, Nyamah et al. 2011). Sulaiman and Jeffry (1994) proposed that the high population of Toxorhynchites splendens could be associated with the low population of Aedes, making Tx. splendens a good candidate for biocontrol agent. When preparing to feed or hunt, Toxorhynchites larva will position its body angle horizontally. When a prey draws near within the larva's striking distance, Toxorhynchites larva will hit and seize the prey with its mandibles. The prey is then typically consumed within minutes, and prey capture can occur either on the surface or at the bottom of the container (Steffan and Evenhuis 1981).",

Predation occurrence would most definitely change the facultative behavior of a particular mosquito larva which later on would affect its susceptibility to a predator (Juliano and Gravel 2002). The ability to identify and avoid potential predators can be considered as a survival strategy (Mirza and Chivers 2003). There is also evidence of evolution in behavioral response of prey when they are exposed to consistent predation risk, suggesting that the predator-prey behavior is adaptive (Blaustein et al. 2000, Juliano andGravel 2002). According to Juliano (2009), mosquito prey larvae have an evolved response mechanism to avoid predation by their natural enemies. In small container system, modified behavior is the basis of anti-predator reaction. In general, predation events and interspecific competition are influenced by behavior and behavioral change of an organism (Kesavaraju and Juliano 2004).",

Three different treatments were applied: 1) control; without any predator; 2) prey alongside with a free roaming predator, and 3) when prey was placed in water which contains residual predator's kairomones but without the actual predators. Kairomones was defined by Nourdland and Lewis (1976) as a substance that is released, acquired, or produced by organism which, when it comes into contact with another species in natural context. This substance will evoke the behavioral and physiological reactions of the receiver but not the emitter. In this study, the emitter refers to Tx. splendens larva, and the receivers are Aedes and Anopheles mosquito larvae. For residual kairomones preparation, a predator was released in 500 ml seasoned water and fed with 10 mosquito larvae for 24 h prior to the start of the treatment. Feeding is crucial to simulate the kairomones release by injured prey (Dodson et al. 1994, Kats and Dill 1998, Kusch et al. 2004 and production of remnants exists from predation event (Kesavaraju and Juliano 2004).

Aedes species is associated with the presence of Tx. splendens predator because both species share the same breeding habitat. Tx. splendens is a container breeder and found in a wide variety of both artificial and natural containers (Steffan and Evenhuis 1981), whereas both Aedes prey was reported to coexisted together with the predator in bamboo stumps, rubber tires, earthen-ware jars, and cans (Trpis 1973, Nyamah et al. 2011. However, shared breeding habitat does not occur between An. sinensis and Tx. splendens predator. This is due to different breeding habitat preference of Anopheles, which prefers clean and unpolluted water (Abu Hassan and Yap 2003) of running water (streams, irrigation, drainage, and slow running rivers) with dense of aquatic vegetations (Mattingly 1969). Therefore, as an initiative to control for Anopheles, Tx. splendens predator must first be introduced into the prey's natural breeding habitat.",

Holt and Lawton (1994) pointed out that an apparent mutualism can occur between competing prey species when the presence of either one would lower the predation rates on the other. For example, selective predation of Corethrella appendiculata and  Toxorhynchites rutilus on Ae. albopictus may also reduce predation on Ae. triseriatus, thus enabling this species to propagate in numbers (Griswold and Lounibos 2005). However, in this study, Tx. splendens showed preference to consume Ae. aegypti even at a lower number perratio compared with the Ae. albopictus and An. sinensis. Based on density-dependent theory, the low density population will remain safe and high population will be decimated to a minimum number. This turn of events allows the low density population to grow rapidly. However, we found no such evidence in our study to support this theory. We postulate that the predation interest by Tx. splendens is caused by the behavior and positioning of Ae. aegypti prey when confronted by the predator. The risky and active behavior and positioning attract predators making the prey to be more vulnerable.",

Because of the active \"thrashing\" behavior flaunted by Ae. aegypti in the water, preys failed to detect the presence of predator and become an easy target. This passive hunting mechanism is suitable for Toxorhynchites, which is a phytotelmata breeder, meaning that rigorous movement is not an option in a small and restricted space. According to Clements (1999), the characteristic of a striking behavior of Toxorhynchites larvae also differs according to the position of approaching prey. When prey is situated directly in front of Toxorhynchites larva's head, the strike movement involved a rapid displacement of the head toward the prey though extension of the neck by over 1 mm. Alternatively, if the prey approaches Toxorhynchites larva from the side or behind, the strike took form of a rapid, lateral bending that moved the predator's head toward the prey.",

            "text": "The dynamics in the behavior could be attributed to the \"threat sensitivity hypothesis\" which stated that a particular prey species would change their avoidance reaction according to the degree of the threat (Helfman, 1989). An. sinensis definitely displays such reaction, where there were significant behaviors displayed between An. sinensis and Ae. aegypti larvae when they were placed with predatory Tx. splendens. An. sinenis larva was seen to be \"resting\" at the \"surface\" of the container \"wall.\" According to Juliano and Reminger (1992), this resting behavior was the least risky behavior in the presence of a potential predator. However, it is also possible that the \"wall' position displayed by An. sinensis was also due to its natural larval behavior where Anopheles larvae were said to demonstrate negative thigmotaxis, a tendency to maintain bodily contact with solid object and its locomotion reduced (Clements 1999). For instance, larvae of Anopheles minimus and Anopheles maculatus, when placed in an experimental water flow channel, anchored themselves to the edge (Muirhead-Thomson 1940), and this ability is due to its dorsal brush setae modified to form hooks which can be used to cling to any solid objects (Lamborn 1921).",

            "text": "Aquatic organisms usually received warning about prospective predation events by means of visual (Chivers et al. 2001) and chemical information known as kairomones, which can be released by injured prey (Dodson et al. 1994, Kats and Dill 1998, Kusch et al. 2004, predation events, predators (Kesavaraju et al. 2007) solid residues from predation events on either conspecifics or competing prey (Kesavaraju and Juliano 2004), and feces from predator that fed on conspecifics (Brown et al. 1955a(Brown et al. ,b, 1966. There is also an evidence suggests that mosquito larval contact with solid residues while foraging were able to provide signal to the presence of predation threat (Kesavaraju and Juliano 2010). However, predation risk cues in aquatic systems can degrade if they are not replenished by additional predation events, and prey thus may alter their reactions depending on the degradation level (Ferrari et al. 2005). In our study, Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and An. sinensis seem to display risky behavior of \"thrashing\" and \"browsing\" activities in kairomones treatments. It is possible that the 24 h residual kairomones from Tx. splendens is not strong enough to elicit their avoidance behavior toward possible predator threats. Therefore, these larvae were freely exhibiting their normal activities without any concern of predator presence.",
