            "text": "Background: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is the main cause of failure following total joint arthroplasty. Until now, the diagnosis of PJI is still confronted with technical limitations, and the question of whether synovial fluid biomarker, C-reactive protein (CRP), can provide high value in the diagnosis of PJI remains unanswered and, therefore, was the aim of the study. Methods: First, we conducted a systematic review on CRP in the diagnosis of PJI by searching online databases using keywords such as \"periprosthetic joint infection\", \"synovial fluid\", and \"C-reactive protein\". Eligible studies providing sufficient data to construct 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables were then selected based on the list of criteria and the quality of included studies was assessed subsequently. Finally, the reported sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve, and the area under the SROC (AUSROC) were pooled together and used to evaluate overall diagnostic performance. Results: Seven studies were included in our review, six of which comprising a total of 456 participants were further investigated in our meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-0.96), 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87-0.93), and 101.40 (95% CI: 48.07-213.93), respectively. The AUSROC was 0.9663 (standard error, 0.0113). Conclusions: Synovial fluid CRP is a good biomarker for the diagnosis of PJI with high sensitivity and specificity.",

            "text": "Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication seen in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients. PJI accounts for 25% of failed knee arthroplasties and 15% of failed hip arthroplasties. [1] It could lead to prolonged hospitalization, repeated surgical intervention, significant permanent deformity, or even definitive loss of the implant. [2] The symptoms of PJI are often nonspecific, which makes the diagnosis of PJI quite challenging. [3] In caring for a painful joint arthroplasty, the ability to distinguish between septic and aseptic failures of the prosthesis is critical as the treatment for PJI necessitates unique surgical strategies that aim to eradicate the infecting organism(s). [4] Traditionally, the hematological diagnosis of PJI is performed by measuring inflammatory factors of white blood cell (WBC) levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum C-reactive protein (CRP). In addition, microbiology analysis of synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue using histology and synovial fluid culture [5] and imaging tests such as enhanced computed tomography bone scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography are also used. [6] However, some of these results are nonspecific for PJI, and the test results have to be combined with the clinical history and symptoms; thus, a more specific and sensitive routine for PJI diagnosis is required. [7] To address the inconsistency of different tests, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) published their first guideline in 2010 as a reference for the diagnosis of PJI, [8] in which ESR and CRP were used as screening tests and joint aspiration should be performed when the level of these markers are elevated. Then, in 2012, the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) renewed with a consensus statement providing a concise definition of a PJI. [9] Although the MSIS definition provides a standard for definitive retrospective diagnosis and research, its complexity makes it difficult to use in daily clinical practice. The ideal method of PJI diagnosis would be a single test or panel that is highly sensitive, specific, and simple to interpret. [10] In recent years, researches on PJI diagnosis have started to focus on synovial fluid instead of serum, since synovial fluid is the site of primary infection, and the diagnosis should be more sensitive than that of serum theoretically. Studies have revealed that number of antimicrobial peptides and inflammatory cytokines including CRP, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-17A, interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, defensin, cathelicidin LL-37, and so on in synovial fluid could be used as biomarkers for diagnosis. [11] CRP is a protein that has long been measured in the serum as an indicator of infection, and it has already become a well-known protein in the orthopedic community. [12] Until now, several studies have suggested that the CRP levels in synovial fluid may serve as a simple and cost-effective means for improving the diagnosis of PJI as the local CRP is thought to enhance complement activation and phagocytosis. [13] However, there are also studies concluded that CRP from synovial fluid does not offer a diagnostic advantage in the detection of PJIs after comparing the value of synovial fluid CRP with serum CRP.",

All studies were conducted prospectively, and five of the studies took the synovial fluid samples before any clinical treatment while one did not mention. However, the cutoff value of synovial fluid CRP varied in each study: 2.8, 3.65, 6.6, 9.5, and 12.2 mg/L, respectively. In addition, to determine synovial fluid CRP, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used in two studies while turbid metric immunoassay or kinetic infrared immunoassay was used in the other four. As for the standard diagnosis, MSIS and AAOS were both included since the details had an overlap with each other. Detailed characteristics of individual study are summarized in Table 1, and detailed number of patients involved in each study and their diagnosis results are illustrated in Table 2. For the included studies, the overall pooled sensitivity was 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-0.96), and the pooled specificity was 0.90 [95% CI: 0.87-0.93, Figure 3a and 3b]. The pooled PLR and NLR were 9.00 (95% CI: 6.15-13.16) and 0.10 [95% CI: 0.06-0.18, Figure 4a and 4b], respectively. The area under the SROC (AUSROC) was 0.9663 [standard error 0.0113, Figure 5] and the DOR was 101.40 (95% CI: 48.07-213.93). The results are summarized in Table 3. Spearman's correlation coefficient (\u22120.40) and the P value (0.60), which represent threshold effect were tested for the between-study variability (heterogeneity). We could also come to the same conclusion since there was no shoulder-like ROC plane curve. The heterogeneity for sensitivity and specificity was tested through I 2 range (0 and 26.8%, respectively).",

            "text": "PJI is currently one of the most common complications associated with TJA and difficult to diagnose. [26] The major reasons for this difficulty are the absence of specific clinical signs and symptoms, the relative lack of accurate laboratory tests, and low culture rate in isolation of pathogens due to prior therapy and formation of biofilms. [27,28] The accurate definition of what constitutes PJI is still controversial; [29] therefore, several orthopedic associations have established clinical guidelines for diagnosing PJI. [30] The MSIS recently responded to this diagnostic difficulty by developing a definition for PJI. [31] According to the MSIS, the diagnosis of PJI definition requires positive result in either one of two major criteria (sinus tract communication with a prosthesis or pathogen isolated by culture from two separate fluid samples) or four of six minor criteria (elevated ESR, elevated CRP, elevated WBC count, elevated percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), presence of purulence, and greater than five neutrophils per high-power field on frozen section). [32] By comparison, AAOS guideline is similar to MSIS, including the following four thresholds: ESR >30 mm/h, serum CRP value >10 mg/L, synovial WBC count >1760 cells/\u00b5l for chronic infection or 10,700 cells/\u00b5l for acute infection, and synovial PMN differential percentage >73% for chronic infection or greater than 89% for acute infection. [8] PJI should be diagnosed if 3 out of 4 thresholds were abnormal.",

[33,34] The promise of synovial fluid biomarkers to diagnose PJI has been reported during the past few years; however, the reference standard in some of these studies is not based on MSIS or AAOS, which makes the comprehensive analysis of these studies more challenging.

As for \u03b1-defensin, all qualified five studies came to the same conclusion that it was a biomarker with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of PJI. Based on the studies we have searched, opinion toward the diagnostic value of synovial fluid CRP is still in debate; thus, we focused on this biomarker. CRP release is induced by the recognition of pathogenic patterns, playing several mechanistic roles in the innate immune response [35] and is currently assayed in the serum as a common and inexpensive test to screen for the presence of PJI in MSIS. [36,37] However, elevated concentration of serum CRP is nonspecific for the diagnosis of localized infection since CRP is an acute-phase reactant in numerous noninfectious diseases. [38] After quality assessment, six articles were highly qualified for our meta-analysis, four of which used MSIS as the reference standard and the rest used AAOS as the reference standard.",

However, CRP was used solely  as a complementary biomarker and evaluated through ROC analysis with the purpose of improving the specificity of \u03b1-defensin assays used. As part of the combined algorithm, this CRP threshold was applied only to \u03b1-defensin-positive samples. After the detection of both \u03b1-defensin and CRP, the false positive \u03b1-defensin results could be reversed to true negative, which meant this CRP cutoff value was decided only for the false positive samples. Therefore, the CRP cutoff value used was relatively low and the generated 2 \u00d7 2 table was not suitable for the meta-analysis in this study.",

However, based on our meta-analysis, the diagnostic value of synovial fluid CRP is higher than that of serum CRP.

First, despite an in-depth search of several electronic databases, there were only six articles qualified for our meta-analysis and it was impossible to further analyze and divide the studies into subgroups to explore other potential factors that may affect the heterogeneity and perform meta-regression analysis. Therefore, characteristics of patients included in each study including age, basic condition before surgery, and the existence of systematic diseases could not be fully analyzed in the meta-analysis. Second, the ideal cutoff value for the synovial fluid CRP test could not be determined since the raw data were not provided in the published articles. It is hard to come to a consistent cutoff value since different laboratories used different methods to detect synovial fluid CRP, for example, ELISA and turbidimetric immunoassay, both of which performed antibody response with the target protein (CRP). As a matter of fact, there is still no standard cutoff value for the diagnosis worldwide currently even for the same method. Thus, our meta-analysis also indicates that large-scale, prospective, randomized trials with standardized reference and detecting method, strict included, and excluded criteria are in urgent requirement to generate a more precise cutoff value for clinicians.",

This systematic review has constituted a primary foundation for evidence-based guides on the diagnostic performance of synovial fluid, which can provide recommendations to clinicians for diagnosing PJI accurately and efficiently.
