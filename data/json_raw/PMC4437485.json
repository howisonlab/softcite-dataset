            "text": "Glial cells can be in vivo reprogrammed into functional neurons in the adult CNS; however, the process by which this reprogramming occurs is unclear. Here, we show that a distinct cellular sequence is involved in SOX2-driven in situ conversion of adult astrocytes to neurons. This includes ASCL1 + neural progenitors and DCX + adult neuroblasts (iANBs) as intermediates. Importantly, ASCL1 is required, but not sufficient, for the robust generation of iANBs in the adult striatum. These progenitor-derived iANBs predominantly give rise to calretinin + interneurons when supplied with neurotrophic factors or the small-molecule valproic acid. Patch-clamp recordings from the induced neurons reveal subtype heterogeneity, though all are functionally mature, fire repetitive action potentials, and receive synaptic inputs. Together, these results show that SOX2-mediated in vivo reprogramming of astrocytes to neurons passes through proliferative intermediate progenitors, which may be exploited for regenerative medicine."

Although adult neurogenesis persists in restricted brain areas (Gage, 2000;Hsieh, 2012;Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009;Lie et al., 2004), neurons do not regenerate in most regions of the adult CNS. An unmet challenge in neural injury and degeneration repair is how to replenish lost neurons for functional recovery.",

            "text": "Cell fate reprogramming provides new means for regenerating damaged or dead neurons (Arlotta and Berninger, 2014;Cherry and Daley, 2012;Matsui et al., 2014). Not only can cells in culture be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006), lineagerestricted stem cells (Kim et al., 2011a;Ring et al., 2012), and different postmitotic cell fates (Heinrich et al., 2010(Heinrich et al., , 2011Karow et al., 2012;Liu et al., 2013;Vierbuchen et al., 2010), but they are also amenable to in vivo fate conversion (Guo et al., 2014;Heinrich et al., 2014;Niu et al., 2013;Qian et al., 2012;Song et al., 2012;Su et al., 2014a, b;Torper et al., 2013;Zhou et al., 2008). In regards to the CNS, resident glial cells have been directly or indirectly converted into functional neurons in the adult brain and spinal cord (Guo et al., 2014;Heinrich et al., 2014;Niu et al., 2013;Su et al., 2014a, b;Torper et al., 2013). Glial cells are broadly distributed and comprise nearly half of the cells in the mammalian CNS. These cells become reactive, proliferate, and form glial scars in response to neural injuries and degen-eration (Karimi-Abdolrezaee and Billakanti, 2012;Sofroniew, 2009). These reactive responses are initially beneficial, restricting the spread of damage, but ultimately are deleterious, acting as both a physical and chemical barrier to neuronal regeneration (Karimi-Abdolrezaee and Billakanti, 2012; Sofroniew, 2009). Reprogramming some of these glial cells to functional neurons may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with the CNS.",

These iANBs pass through a proliferative state and generate mature neurons when supplied with neurotrophic factors. This SOX2driven in vivo reprogramming process sharply contrasts direct lineage conversion strategies (Guo et al., 2014;Qian et al., 2012;Song et al., 2012;Su et al., 2014b;Torper et al., 2013;Zhou et al., 2008), which change cell fate in a linear fashion without amplification of the induced cell population. However, the cellular mechanism underlying SOX2-dependent in vivo reprogramming of astrocytes was unclear. Furthermore, the subtypes of iANB-derived neurons were not well characterized. In this study, we reveal that SOX2-driven reprogramming of astrocytes transits through intermediate neural progenitor states before the adoption of a mature neuron fate. Immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology further show that induced neurons are functionally mature and predominantly express the marker calretinin.",

            "text": "Ectopic Expression of SOX2, but Not the Other SOXB1 Factors, Results in iANBs SOX2 belongs to the SOXB1 subfamily of high-mobility group-box transcription factors, which also includes SOX1 and SOX3 (Sarkar and Hochedlinger, 2013). These factors are critical for specifying and maintaining the undifferentiated state of neural precursors. The expression of SOXB1 factors during SOX2-mediated in vivo reprogramming were investigated using immunohistochemistry (Niu et al., 2013). The adult mouse striatum was injected with lentivirus expressing SOX2 under the human GFAP promoter. When analyzed 4 weeks post-injection (wpi), DCX + iANBs were robustly detected in the virus-injected regions, confirming our previous results (Niu et al., 2013). Interestingly, SOX1 can also be detected in striatal regions with iANBs, especially in DCX + cell clusters ( Figure 1A). However, SOX1 expression is lower in iANBs than neighboring DCX \u00c0 cells, which is consistent with previous findings that the continued highlevel expression of SOXB1 factors prohibits neuronal differentiation (Bylund et al., 2003;Niu et al., 2013). In contrast, SOX3 is only sporadically distributed in the adult striatum and is not detectable in DCX + iANBs ( Figure 1A). Due to sequence and potential functional similarity (Bylund et al., 2003), we investigated whether the SOXB1 proteins can similarly induce DCX + cells. Lentiviruses expressing SOX1 or SOX3 under the GFAP promoter were individually injected into the adult striatum. However, when examined at 4 or 5 wpi, no DCX + cells were detected in striatal regions with ectopic SOX1 or SOX3 expression, in sharp contrast to areas injected with SOX2-expressing virus that contain DCX + cells ( Figure 1B). Together, these data indicate that SOX2 has a unique property among the SOXB1 factors, enabling the reprogramming of resident astrocytes to iANBs.",

            "text": "iANBs Are Not the Progeny of Induced Neural Stem Cells Adult neurogenesis is a multistep process that starts with multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) that gradually transition into DCX + neuroblasts (Hsieh, 2012;Kempermann et al., 2004;Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009;Ma et al., 2009). Both SOX1 and SOX2 are expressed in NSCs that can give rise to neurons and glia (Suh et al., 2007;Venere et al., 2012). The residual expression of these factors in DCX + iANBs suggests that ectopic SOX2 might reprogram astrocytes into a multipotent NSC state. We surveyed the expression of several additional markers for NSCs surrounding striatal regions injected with SOX2-expressing virus at 4 wpi. Nestin (NES), an intermediate filament protein highly enriched in embryonic and adult NSCs (Lagace et al., 2007), can be sparsely detected in neighboring regions with iANBs ( Figure S2). Similarly, cells expressing brain-lipid-binding protein, a marker for radial glia in developing brain and type-1 and type-2 neural precursors of the adult dentate gyrus (DG) (Feng et al., 1994;Steiner et al., 2006), are intermingled with iANBs in the adult striatum. GFAP + cells are also found in the vicinity of iANBs ( Figure S2). GFAP is robustly induced in reactive astrocytes and also labels NSCs in the adult lateral ventricle (LV) and DG (Doetsch, 2003;Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009;Lie et al., 2004). Although the above markers were not detected in DCX + cells, these data support a hypothesis that iANBs might be derived from SOX2-induced NSCs in the striatum.",

Very interestingly, ASCL1 + cells can be specifically detected in the striatal regions around DCX + iANBs when injected with SOX2, but not a control virus, at 5 wpi ( Figure 3A). A time course analysis further showed that the number of ASCL + cells gradually increases post-injection of SOX2 virus, reaches a peak level around 5 wpi, and persists beyond 14 wpi ( Figure 3B). We used the GFAP-GFP marker to label virus-transduced astrocytes in the adult striatum and revealed specific ASCL1 expression in these GFP + cells, which clustered with SOX2-induced DCX + cells ( Figure 3C).",

We examined this possibility using Ascl1-CreER T2 mice, in which the tamoxifen-inducible CreER T2 was knocked into the endogenous Ascl1 locus (Kim et al., 2011b). After crossing to mice harboring the Cre-activity-dependent Rosa-tdTomato (tdT) reporter (Madisen et al., 2010), ASCL1 + cells and their progeny can be uniquely traced. These adult mice were injected with a SOX2-expressing or control virus, administered tamoxifen for 7 days starting at 2 wpi, and examined at 6 wpi (Figure 3D). Whereas no tdT + cells were detected in striatal regions injected with the control virus, these cells were robustly distributed in regions injected with the SOX2 virus ( Figure 3E). Consistent with the hypothesis that iANBs are derived from ASCL1 + neural progenitors, over 90% of SOX2-induced DCX + cells could be labeled by tdT. Together, these data show that ectopic SOX2 reprograms striatal astrocytes to ASCL1 + neural progenitors, which subsequently give rise to DCX + iANBs.",

The induction of ASCL1 in the adult striatum suggests that it may be critical for SOX2-driven in vivo reprogramming of astrocytes. To examine this possibility, we used genetically modified mice that contain conditional alleles of Ascl1 (Ascl1 f/f ; Pacary et al., 2011) and a tamoxifen-inducible CreER T2 transgene under the astrocyte-specific Cst3 promoter (Figure 4A)  (Niu et al., 2013). These adult mice were treated with tamoxifen or vehicle for 7 days and then injected with SOX2-expressing lentivirus. Immunohistochemistry was performed 5 wpi and revealed a dramatic reduction in the population of DCX + iANBs upon inducible deletion of Ascl1 ( Figures 4B and 4C). The few residual DCX + cells might be due to an incomplete deletion of Ascl1 in all the SOX2 virus-infected astrocytes. These data indicate that ASCL1 plays a critical role in SOX2-driven reprogramming.",

However, the subtype of neurons generated by these treatments was unclear. We surveyed the expression of markers for striatal neurons by immunohistochemistry in regions injected with SOX2 virus at 8 wpi. To promote neuron survival and maturation, some of these mice were also injected with virus expressing BDNF or BDNF-noggin or were treated with VPA for 4 weeks starting at 4 wpi ( Figures  S3A and S3B). Among all these treatment groups, we did not notice any major change in the populations of neurons expressing parvalbumin, somatostatin, choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, or DARPP32 ( Figure S3C; data not shown). In sharp contrast, we observed a dramatic induction of calretinin neurons in striatal regions of mice injected with SOX2 virus and treated with the neurotrophic factors or small molecule ( Figures S3C and S3D).

A cohort of SOX2 virus-injected mice was also treated with VPA in drinking water for 4 weeks beginning at 4 wpi. All mice were administered BrdU for 4 weeks to label newly generated cells ( Figure 5A). When analyzed at 8 wpi, 30%-70% of calretinin cells could be traced by BrdU in striatal regions injected with SOX2 virus and treated with either neurotropic factors or VPA ( Figure 5B). A majority of these BrdU + calretinin + neurons were also NEUN + , a marker for mature neurons ( Figure 5C). These neurons were not detectable in any of the control groups, confirming that the long-term survival and maturation of SOX2-induced neurons requires neurotrophic factors (Niu et al., 2013). Cell-of-origin tracing was used to map the lineage of induced calretinin + neurons in transgenic mice. Astrocytes were specifically labeled by tamoxifen-inducible expression of YFP in adult Cst3-CreER T2 ;Rosa-YFP mice ( Figure 5D) (Niu et al., 2013). Three weeks later, these mice received striatal injections of SOX2-expressing lentivirus and were treated with VPA for 4 weeks starting at 5 wpi. When analyzed at 10 wpi, calretinin + neurons were uniquely traced by YFP, indicating an origin from adult striatal astrocytes ( Figure 5E).

Type II neurons (n = 2/27) are similarly hyperpolarized around \u00c080 mV but show a much-higher input resistance (200-1,000 MU). The resting membrane potential of type III (n = 2/27) and type IV (n = 3/27) neurons is \u00c060 mV; however, the respective input resistances differ widely, $150 MU and $2,000 MU.

Interestingly, type III induced neurons spontaneously fired APs at their resting membrane potential ( Figures S3E and S4F), a phenomenon widely observed in many CNS neurons. These neurons might function in the synchronization of circuit activity or sustain modulatory inputs onto postsynaptic neurons (H\u00e4usser et al., 2004;Maccaferri and McBain, 1996). By depolarizing the induced neurons from \u00c060 mV to +60 mV in 10-mV increments, we further examined the behaviors of sodium and potassium channels (Figure S4G). The large inward current from voltage-gated sodium channels was completely blocked by the application of tetrodotoxin ( Figure S4H). These sodium currents (I Na ) varied broadly and were not considerably different between subtypes of induced neurons ( Figure S4I). The outward currents in the plateau phase of the voltage step represent delayed rectifier potassium currents (I d ; Figure S4G), which were much lower in type IV induced neurons (Figure S4J). The approximate summation of fast potassium current (I A ) and I d collectively represent the outward current immediately following the inward sodium current. I A was smaller in type IV induced neurons than the other three types ( Figure S4K). These data suggest that ion channel distributions in type IV induced neurons are different from the other three types.",

This difference highlights the critical importance of the microenvironment in cell fate reprogramming and suggests that additional factors are required to enable SOX2 to convert glial cells into multipotent stem cells in the adult (F) Representative action potential traces from each type of reprogrammed neurons. (G) All the induced neurons have a similar action potential (AP) threshold. (H and I) A majority of the induced neurons have higher AP amplitudes and frequencies. (J) Type IV induced neurons have wider AP half-width. (K-M) Properties of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs). Whereas there is a broader range of sPSC frequencies, their amplitude is rather similar (n.a., not available). For all panels, n = 20 cells from 11 mice for type I neurons, n = 2 cells from two mice for type II neurons, n = 2 cells from one mouse for type III neurons, and n = 3 cells from three mice for type IV neurons. See also Figure S4. CNS. Our initial in vivo screens for reprogramming factors included the four factors for induced pluripotent stem cells (Niu et al., 2013); however, this combination of factors has been subsequently shown to induce tumorigenesis in vivo (Abad et al., 2013;Ohnishi et al., 2014) and raised serious concerns about the therapeutic value of in vivo induced pluripotent stem cells. In contrast, we have not observed any histological signs of tumorigenesis in brains or spinal cords with ectopic SOX2 expression when examined up to 1 year post virus injection. This is consistent with a recent study showing that multiple key transcription factors are required to initiate brain tumors in vivo (Suv\u00e0 et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Adult neurogenesis is a multistep process beginning with multipotent NSCs that yield transient amplifying neural progenitors and then mature neurons (Gage, 2000;Hsieh, 2012;Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009;Lie et al., 2004). Our immunohistochemistry and genetic fate-mapping experiments demonstrate that SOX2-driven in vivo reprogramming passes through an ASCL1 + intermediate progenitor stage. These progenitors give rise to DCX + neuroblasts, which can further proliferate and expand the neuronal lineage (Niu et al., 2013). This sequential and multistage amplification process is consistent with what has been observed in the adult neurogenic niches, suggesting that the reprogrammed glial cells have adopted the behavior of endogenous progenitors (Kim et al., 2011b;Lugert et al., 2012). ASCL1 serves as a molecular marker of neural progenitors and also controls their activity, including proliferation and differentiation (Andersen et al., 2014;Battiste et al., 2007;Jessberger et al., 2008;Kim et al., 2007Kim et al., , 2008. Consistently, our conditional deletion of Ascl1 in astrocytes shows that it is critically important for robust in vivo reprogramming. Nonetheless, ASCL1 cannot replace SOX2 in the induction of neurogenesis from adult astrocytes, as DCX + iANBs are rarely detected in striatal regions with ectopic ASCL1 during a series of time course analyses. This result agrees with a recent in vivo study (Heinrich et al., 2014) and suggests that additional factors are also required in combination with ASCL1 to mediate SOX2 function in cell fate reprograming in the adult brain. In contrast, ASCL1 alone is able to transdifferentiate early postnatal astroglia (Heinrich et al., 2010(Heinrich et al., , 2012, fibroblasts (Chanda et al., 2014), and embryonic stem cells (Chanda et al., 2014) into functional neurons in culture. This discrepancy between results from in vitro and in vivo studies once again highlights the importance of the cellular milieu in cell fate specification, determination, and reprogramming.",

Interestingly, calretinin was shown to be transiently co-expressed with DCX during the early stage of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and subsequently downregulated once newly born neurons become mature 6 weeks later (Brandt et al., 2003). In contrast, calretinin is rarely detectable in iANBs but continuously expressed once they develop into mature neurons by 8 wpi, suggesting the stable generation of this neuronal subtype. The preferential reprogramming of striatal astrocytes by SOX2 to calretinin + neurons was unexpected but is most likely due to signaling cues present in the adult striatum or intrinsic factors residing in the striatal astrocytes. It will be interesting in the future to tease out these instructive factors for the generation of specific neuron subtypes.",

These neurons are diverse in morphology with limited electrophysiological characterization (Tepper et al., 2010). Electrophysiological analyses show that the induced neurons are heterogeneous, although the majority is hyperpolarized with lower input resistance and higher AP amplitude and frequency. This heterogeneity may reflect functional diversity and/or the progressive nature of neuronal maturation and integration into the local circuits. Interestingly, a minority of the recorded neurons exhibit pacemaker-like activity and fire spontaneous APs at resting membrane potential. This activity is prevalent in striatal cholinergic neurons, subthalamic nucleus neurons, midbrain dopaminergic neurons, cerebellar Purkinje and Golgi neurons, and low-threshold spike interneurons of the striatum (Beatty et al., 2012;Reynolds and Wickens, 2004;Sharott et al., 2012). The pace-making activity of these neurons can synchronize neuronal networks for higher-order brain functions (Ramirez et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Adult mice were euthanized with CO 2 overdose and sequentially perfused with ice-cold PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were collected and postfixed with 4% PFA for 4-6 hr or overnight at 4 C. Postfixed brains were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose solution in PBS for 24 hr and cut into 40-mm-thick sections with a sliding microtome (Leica). Brain sections were serially collected and stored in antifreezing solution at \u00c020 C. Immunohistochemistry was performed essentially as previously described (Niu et al., 2011). Briefly, free-floating sections were rinsed with PBS and blocked with blocking solution (3% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature. These sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for at least 24 hr at 4 C followed by three rinses with PBST buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS). They were subsequently incubated with respective secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for over 2 hr at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 when appropriate. After extensive rinsing with PBST buffer, sections were mounted onto glass slides for microscopy. The following primary antibodies were used: GFP (A-11122, rabbit, 1:500, Invitrogen; GFP, chick, 1:1,000, Aves Labs), GFAP (G3893; mouse; 1:500; Sigma), BrdU (OBT0030; rat BU1/75; 1:500; Accurate Chemical), NEUN (MAB377; mouse; 1:500; Millipore), SOX1 (4194S; rabbit; 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology), SOX2 (AB5603; rabbit; 1:500; Millipore), SOX3 (rabbit; 1:200; a gift from M. Klymkowsky; Wang et al., 2006), BLBP (AB9558; rabbit; 1:500; Millipore), NES (556309; mouse; 1:200; BD PharMingen), KI-67 (NCL-Ki67; rabbit; 1:500; Novocastra), DCX (sc-8066; goat; 1:150; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), OLIG2 (AB9610; rabbit; 1:500; Millipore), glutamine synthetase (MAB302; mouse; 1:500; Chemicon), PSA-NCAM (5A5-a; mouse; 1:250; Hybridoma bank), NG2 (MAB5384; mouse; 1:500; Milli-pore), IBA1 (019-19741; rabbit; 1:1,000; Waco), Parvalbumin (P3088; mouse; 1:1,000; Sigma), somatostatin (AB5494; rabbit; 1:500; Chemicon), CHAT (CAT; chick; 1:1,000; Aves), Calretinin (AB702; rabbit; 1:200; Novus), DARPP32 (2302; rabbit; 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology), CC-1 (OP80; mouse; 1:500; Calbiochem), and ASCL1 (TX-518; guinea pig; 1:10,000; Jane Johnson). Alexa-488-, Alexa-Fluor-594-, or Alexa-Fluor-647-conjugated corresponding secondary antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch were used for indirect fluorescence. Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. A Cell Counter software plugin in the ImageJ program was used to count cells. Data were obtained from 12 random sections from three to five mice in each group.",

            "text": "Adult mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with chilled (4 C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 11 mM D-glucose at pH 7.4, 300 mOsm, and aerated with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ), including 0.5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1% kynurenate acid. The striatum with overlying neocortex was then dissected out. Acute sagittal slices (250 mm thickness) were collected between +2 mm and \u00c02 mm from bregma on a Leica VT1200S slicer. They were then incubated in aerated ACSF with 3 mM CaCl 2 and 2 mM MgCl 2 to recover for 30 min at 35 C followed by additional incubation for over 1 hr at room temperature. A single slice was then transferred to a submersion chamber and perfused at 3 ml/min with aerated ACSF at 30 C. Lineage-traced cells in the striatum were identified under visual guidance using IR-DIC optics and tdTomato fluorescence. Whole-cell currentclamp and voltage-clamp recordings were performed using glass pipettes ($6-9 MU) filled with intracellular solution (0.2 mM EGTA, 130 mM K-gluconate, 6 mM KCl, 3 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM ATP-Mg, 0.4 mM GTP-Na, and 14 mM phosphocreatine-Tris at pH 7.2 and 285 mOsm). Intracellular solution was supplemented with 0.5% biocytin (B4261; Sigma) for biocytin labeling. All recordings were obtained with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier. Currents were filtered at 2 kHz, acquired, and digitized at 10 kHz using Clampex10.3 (Molecular Devices). APs were recorded in current clamp mode and elicited by a series of current injections starting from \u00c0160 pA with 20-, 40-, 80-, or 160-pA increments and 800 ms duration. Sodium and potassium currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode in response to a series of voltage steps ranging from \u00c060 mV to +60 mV at 10-mV increments and 100 ms duration. Delayed rectifier potassium currents (K d ) were measured 50 ms prior to the end of current step. Spontaneous synaptic currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode. In all voltage-clamp recordings, cells were clamped at \u00c060 mV or \u00c080 mV, whichever is close to the resting membrane potential of the cell except during the voltage-step protocol. In all current-clamp recordings, recordings were made at the resting membrane potential or without any current injection. Series and input resistance were measured in voltage-clamp mode with a 400 ms, \u00c010 mV step from a \u00c060 mV holding potential (filtered by 10 kHz, sampled at 50 kHz). Cells were accepted only if the series resistance was less than 30 MU and stable throughout the experiment. Data analysis was performed in Clampfit10.3 (Molecular Devices)."
