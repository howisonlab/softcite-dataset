The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of PM10 upon normal children's lung function. The subjects were 368 middle school students in two areas of Incheon Metropolitan City. One (Incheon) is in the central city and the other (Ganghwa) is in the suburbs. Air pollution data in the vicinities of two participating schools were obtained from monthly report of air quality from Korean Ministry of Environment in 2000. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) was done two times, the first one in March and the second one in December with the same students. We analyzed the relationship between the PM10 levels and pulmonary functions (FEV1, FVC) of the children. The monthly average of the PM10 level between the two areas showed no significant difference (55.3 vs. 52.3 g/m 3 ). In both regions, the difference of the PM10 level between March and December was statistically significant (64 vs. 56 g/m 3 in Incheon, 64 vs. 54 g/m 3 in Ganghwa). The findings of the PFT values in March were significantly lower than those values found in December for both regions. In conclusion, we suggest that PM10 has some adverse effect on the pulmonary function of normal children.",

            "text": "The prevalence of asthma has increased worldwide and this has been most strikingly observed in the industrialized countries during the last decade. Epidemiologic studies suggest that environmental factors including air pollution play an important role for the increasing prevalence of asthma. The major air pollutants are CO, NOX, O3, SO2 and particulate matters. Among these pollutants, PM10 can have easily access to the lung via the respiratory tract, and this matter can deposit within the lung (25). According to the study in Utah, U.S.A., during the winter when the level of PM10 was high, the number of patients with respiratory diseases was three times higher than that measured during the winter, when the level of PM10 was low since the steel factory workers went on a strike (26). Moreover, several investigators reported that not only have the number of patients at outpatient department or an emergency room increased, but also the hospitalized or expired patients increased on the days when atmospheric dust was prevalent (8,9,27). In Korea, the highest daily level of total suspended particles (TSP) was reported to be correlated with the number of hospitalization for asthma among the patients who were over 40 yr of age (15).",

These findings would be due to the yellow dust storms which refers to the wind-blown dust generated from northern China and Mongolia during the spring season. In Korea, yellow dust storms are usually observed in March and May every year, when the level of PM10 exceeds the level of environmental standard by two or three times (28). The size of particulate matter from the yellow dust is mainly 3 m (29). This range of particulate matter is easily respirable. So it is expected that this kind of particulate matter would have deleterious effects on respiratory system of normal children. Yellow dust storms occurred 4 times during March 2000 in Incheon and Ganghwa (30).",

Even when taking into consideration the increase of the children's height and weight during the nine months period, the results of pulmonary function test in December were higher than those for the grades one year older, who were checked in March, for almost all grades. Because only the level of PM10 was significantly higher for March than for December in both areas, we suggest that the decrements of pulmonary function in March for both areas   There are several limitations in this study including the lack of personal exposure data, the possibility of other air pollutant's effects, and lack of exact data of air pollutants on the day when the pulmonary function testing was performed. The levels of NO2 and SO2 were two times higher in Incheon than in Ganghwa and the levels O3 were higher in Ganghwa than in Incheon both for March and for December (Table 3). However, the levels of SO2 and O3 were similar in both May and December in each areas. The levels of NO2 were higher for December than for March in both areas. Therefore, we believe that the decrements of the value of pulmonary function in March were caused by particulate matter.",
