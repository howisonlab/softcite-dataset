Ideas of how morphogens impart spatial information have been dominated by the assumption that these molecules form concentration gradients by diffusion, inducing dose-dependent responses in the receiving field of cells. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that for some ligands, for example, Hedgehog, Wnt, and Fgf, other mechanisms, such as short-range signaling activation, transcriptional feedback, and cellular rearrangements, underlie morphogen function (Alexandre et al., 2014;Cohen et al., 2013;Durdu et al., 2014).",

Ndr1/2 are thought to form a signaling gradient by diffusion, extending up to about ten cell tiers from the margin (Dubrulle et al., 2015;Harvey and Smith, 2009;Schier, 2009). Indeed, expression of presumed long-range Nodal target genes such as ta (ntla) and fscn1a suggests low-level signaling up to ten cell tiers from the margin (Bennett et al., 2007). This appears supported by bimolecular fluorescent complementation experiments (Harvey and Smith, 2009). However, other Nodal target genes are expressed in up to five to six cell tiers from the margin, which coincides with nuclear accumulation of Smad2-GFP fusion protein (Dubrulle et al., 2015). Importantly, other signaling pathways, such as Bmp, Wnt, and Fgf, are also active at the margin, which can potentially co-regulate Nodal target genes and thus contribute to their expression domains.",

This model requires positive and negative feedback, which is provided by Nodal-induced expression of both the ligands Ndr1/2 and the antagonists Lefty1 (Lft1) and Lefty2 (Lft2) (Chen and Shen, 2004;Cheng et al., 2004). Besides these feedback mechanisms, the model requires Lft1/2 to be more diffusible than Ndr1/2 (M\u00fc ller et al., 2012;Schier and Talbot, 2005). These conditions are thought to allow Ndr1/2 to activate signaling at the margin, whereas Lft1/2 proteins would inhibit signaling in more distal cells. Overexpression studies have shown that Ndr1/2 and Lft1/2 can differentially diffuse and that Ndr1, but not Ndr2, can diffuse over a distance to activate signaling Schier, 2001, 2002;M\u00fc ller et al., 2012). However, the importance of diffusion of endogenous Ndr1/2 remains unclear, as mesendoderm can develop normally in zygotic ndr1 mutants (Dougan et al., 2003;Feldman et al., 1998;Lim et al., 2013).",

Using this line combined with immunofluorescence for phosphorylated Smad2 (P-Smad2), we show that Nodal signals exclusively in cells that express Ndr1/2, up to five to six cell tiers from the margin. This prompted us to revisit the mechanism underlying the formation of the Nodal signaling domain. Our data do not support the reaction-diffusion model, but instead, we propose that Nodal activates signaling in a temporal window that is defined by a miR-430-mediated delay of Lft1/2 translation. In this way, temporal information is converted into spatial information in the developing embryo.",

However, in addition to Nodal, Fgf signaling is also known to regulate ta expression (Griffin et al., 1995;Rodaway et al., 1999;Schier and Talbot, 2005). Genes encoding Fgf ligands, such as fgf3 and fgf8a, are expressed in the margin ( Figure S1A) and are known Nodal targets (Mathieu et al., 2004), suggesting that Fgf signaling at the margin of blastula-stage embryos is downstream of Nodal signaling (Rodaway et al., 1999). This is clearly demonstrated by treating embryos with the Nodal inhibitor SB-505124 (Hagos and Dougan, 2007), which results in a near complete loss of phosphorylated Erk (P-Erk), a readout for Fgf pathway activity (Dorey and Amaya, 2010)  (Figures 1A and 1B).",

To inhibit Fgf signaling, wild-type (WT) embryos were treated with the Fgf receptor (FgfR) inhibitor SU-5402 (Mohammadi et al., 1997) or were injected with mRNA encoding a dominant-negative FgfR (dnFgfR) (Amaya et al., 1991) ( Figure 1C). Both treatments resulted in a reduction in the size of the expression domains of ta and fscn1a in the margin of 40%-50% epiboly embryos, but not of lft1 or lft2 ( Figure 1D). In fact, lft2 expression was increased. Similarly, morpholinos (MOs) against fgf3 and fgf8a resulted in a reduction of ta expression, but not of lft1 (Figure S1B). qPCR on SU-5402-treated 50% epiboly embryos confirmed the whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) results ( Figure 1E), and as expected, inhibition of Nodal signaling by SB-505124 led to reduction in expression of all four genes (Figure 1E). Importantly, FgfR inhibition had no effect on C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2 (P-Smad2) or overall Smad2 levels, demonstrating that Nodal signaling is not affected by Fgf signaling inhibition ( Figure 1F).",

This indicated that ta expression beyond six cell tiers was due to Fgf signaling and not directly dependent on Nodal. In support of this idea, injection of increasing doses of fgf8a mRNA into a maternal zygotic (MZ) tdgf1 \u00c0/\u00c0 background confirmed that Nodal signaling is not required for induction of ta by Fgf, excluding a requirement for synergism between Nodal and Fgf signaling for ta expression beyond six cell tiers ( Figure S1C). This was further confirmed by the observation that inhibition of Nodal signaling from the 16-cell stage resulted in the loss of both ta and lft1 expression, but when Nodal signaling was inhibited from dome stage, only lft1 expression was severely reduced, whereas the expression of ta was unaffected ( Figure S1D). Thus ta expression is not dependent on Nodal activity after Fgf signaling has been initiated.",

We chose this reporter, which we have extensively characterized in a number of cell culture and developmental contexts (Germain et al., 2000;Inman and Hill, 2002;Randall et al., 2004), because Foxh1 is the primary transcription factor required for immediate early Nodal target gene expression (Pogoda et al., 2000;Slagle et al., 2011). In addition, Smad2 is the predominant receptorregulated Smad during blastula stages ( Figure S2A), and indeed MZ deletion of Smad2 results in a phenotype identical to MZtdgf1 \u00c0/\u00c0 embryos (Dubrulle et al., 2015).",

The eGFP expression domains correspond to the expression domains of Nodal ligands (Schier, 2009) and include the embryonic margin at blastula stages, axial mesoderm during gastrulation, and the left lateral plate mesoderm during somitogenesis (Figures 2A and S3). Incubation of developing Tg(ARE:eGFP) embryos with SB-505124 resulted in a strong reduction of eGFP staining ( Figure 2B). This was also the case when foxh1 MOs were injected or when the Tg(ARE:eGFP) embryos were bred into a tdgf1 \u00c0/\u00c0 background ( Figure 2B). The Tg(ARE:eGFP) reporter is therefore specific for Smad2-Smad4-Foxh1-mediated Nodal signaling during blastula stages.",

We could show that ndr1 transcripts are polyadenylated before the maternal-to-zygotic transition (Figure S4B), suggesting that maternal ndr1 is translated and may signal during blastula stages. This was demonstrated by knocking down the Mix-like transcription factor Mxtx2, which is required for zygotic ndr1 and ndr2 expression in the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) (Fan et al., 2007;Hong et al., 2011;Xu et al., 2012). Tg(ARE:eGFP) mxtx2 morphants retained only a small, dorsal domain that expressed ndr1, ndr2, and eGFP ( Figure S4C). Loss of the ventrolateral expression of ndr1/2 in the blastoderm in mxtx2 morphants suggested that this ndr1/2 expression was initiated by Nodal ligands secreted by the YSL and resulted from the ability of Ndr1/2 to induce their own expression. Indeed, embryos incubated with the Nodal inhibitor SB-505124 from the 32-cell stage exhibited complete loss of expression of ndr1/2 in the blastoderm of 40% epiboly embryos, whereas expression of ndr1/2 in the YSL was not affected ( Figure S4D) (Fan et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Cell Tiers from the Margin The Tg(ARE:eGFP) zebrafish line provides an ideal tool to investigate the dimensions of the Nodal signaling domain at the margin. To initially investigate whether there was any Nodal signaling beyond the ligand-expressing domain, we performed double fluorescent WISH for ndr2 and eGFP in 30% epiboly embryos, when the Nodal signaling domain is expanding (Dubrulle et al., 2015;Harvey and Smith, 2009). Although individual signaling cells were occasionally observed directly adjacent to ndr2-expressing cells, no eGFP-positive cells were detected further beyond the ligand expression domain ( Figure S5A). To determine the extent of Nodal signaling more rigorously, 40%-50% epiboly Tg(ARE:eGFP) embryos were stained for eGFP, ndr1, ndr2, lft1, and lft2 expression, sectioned, and quantitated ( Figures 3A and 3B). The expression of eGFP, ndr1, ndr2, and lft1 was limited to an average of about five cell tiers, whereas lft2 expression was detected in only two to three cell tiers from the margin. To confirm that these findings were not due to a lack of sensitivity of the WISH, we analyzed the expression of sox3, which is repressed by Nodal signaling in the margin  (Bennett et al., 2007). Significant repression was seen in up to six cell tiers from the margin ( Figure 3A). Importantly, staining for all induced Nodal target genes, including eGFP, was consistently stronger in a cluster of cells directly proximal to the YSL, where signaling originates ( Figure 3A). To corroborate the data obtained from the sections, we used a direct readout of the Nodal pathway, fluorescent immunostaining of whole-mount 50% epiboly embryos with an antibody against P-Smad2. For comparison, we also stained for P-Erk. Nuclear P-Smad2 staining was observed exclusively in the margin and, as expected, in a smaller domain than the P-Erk staining ( Figure 3C). To quantitate the size of the P-Smad2positive domain, we imaged the embryos at the margin, used MetaMorph software to generate normalized nuclear staining intensities, and measured the distance of each nucleus from the margin in control-and SB-505124-treated embryos. P-Smad2 staining above background was found up to five to six cell tiers (80-90 mm) from the margin in a steep gradient, which was abolished in SB-505124-treated embryos ( Figures 3D, 3E, and S5B-S5D). The staining was strongest in the nuclei of cells nearest the YSL. Taken together with our observations from the Tg(ARE:eGFP) reporter line, these data demonstrate that Nodal signaling occurs in five to six cell tiers from the margin, closely mirroring the expression of the ligands.",

Second, given that all cells are competent to signal at blastula stages and Nodal signaling induces the expression of the ligands, why does signaling not spread throughout the embryo?",

The Lft1/2 proteins are known to inhibit signaling by sequestering Tdgf1 and possibly also Nodal itself (Chen and Shen, 2004;Cheng et al., 2004). As expected, injection of lft1/2 MOs led to an expansion of the Nodal signaling domain at 50% epiboly, which was confirmed by qPCR ( Figures 4A and  4B). At dome stage, however, there was no increase in the size of the Nodal signaling domain, suggesting that Lft1/2 do not regulate Nodal signaling at early stages. Although there is an offset in the appearance of ndr1/2 and lft1/2 mRNA due to the presence of maternal ndr1 transcripts, the lack of an early role for Lft1/2 is not explained by an absence of lft1/2 mRNA at sphere and dome stages ( Figures 4C and S3). We hypothesized therefore that a delay in translation of the Lft1/2 proteins could account for the inability of Lft1/2 to regulate Nodal signaling at dome stage. Both lft1 and lft2 transcripts were readily polyadenylated by sphere stage (Figure 4D), suggesting that lack of polyadenylation could not account for any delay in Lft1/2 translation.",

Although both antibodies recognized their corresponding target protein when overexpressed ( Figure S6B), only the Lft1 antibody was able to detect endogenous protein, so we focused on this family member. The major band detected by western blot corresponding to endogenous Lft1 migrated by SDS-PAGE with a molecular weight of $40 kD ( Figure S6C). Mutation analysis indicated that this product arose from cleavage at the first Furin cleavage site (marked as C1 in Figure S6A), and we could demonstrate that this product was active ( Figures  S6D-S6F). The same 40 kD band was also detected in embryos injected with ndr1 mRNA ( Figure S6G). Levels of endogenous Lft1 were barely detectable by western blotting at dome stage and 30% epiboly but increased at 50% epiboly ( Figures 4E  and 4F). Thus, endogenous Lft1 protein levels remain low until 50% epiboly, despite readily detectable mRNA levels at all these time points. This suggested that the lack of an early role for Lft1/2 could be due to low protein abundance and led us to hypothesize that repressed Lft1/2 translation creates a window of opportunity for Nodal signaling to become established.",

            "text": "To determine whether reduced signaling in the miR-430 morphants was due to premature translation of Lft1/2 and to investigate the spatial consequences for Nodal signaling of the loss of miR-430, we injected miR-430 MOs and/or lft1/2 MOs into Tg(ARE:eGFP) embryos and assayed Nodal activity (eGFP) and ndr1 levels at 30% epiboly. Injection of lft1/2 MOs alone resulted in a modest increase in eGFP and ndr1 staining (Figure 5E), whereas injection of miR-430 MOs led to a reduction in eGFP staining in the blastoderm, consistent with the inhibition of the Nodal signaling pathway we observed using P-Smad2 levels as a readout ( Figure 5D). When lft1/2 MOs and miR-430 MOs were co-injected, signaling was activated in the entire blastoderm, and this was accompanied by a similar expansion of ndr1 expression ( Figure 5E). Importantly, this spreading of eGFP staining in lft1/2 and miR-430 MO-co-injected embryos was due to Nodal signaling, because it was completely blocked by incubating double morphants with SB-505124 ( Figure 5F). The further spreading of signaling following combined knockdown of lft1/2 and miR-430 is readily explained by the regulation of Ndr1 translation by miR-430 in the absence of Lft1/2 (see Figure 7A) (Choi et al., 2007). Together, these experiments demonstrate that miR-430 delays Lft1/2 translation to create a temporal window for Nodal to activate signaling. ",

Dissociated embryonic cells were therefore exposed to NODAL for 1 hr, and then signaling was inhibited by addition of mLEFTY1 for 2 hr. We observed that P-Smad2 levels decreased slowly, compared with the rapid termination of signaling with SB-505124 (Figure 6C). This demonstrated that although signal activation is blocked by Lefty, Nodal signaling is sustained for some time, presumably because of continued signaling from internalized receptor complexes in early endosomes (Jullien and Gurdon, 2005; Viz\u00e1 n et al., 2013).",

We show that signaling is initiated on the dorsal side because of maternally provided Ndr1. Ventral and lateral signaling arises as a result of Ndr1/2 expression in the YSL, which then spreads toward the animal pole as a result of autoregulation. Nodal signaling in the margin reaches a maximum of six cell tiers, which we demonstrate by P-Smad2 immunostaining and reporter activity. We find no evidence of signaling beyond the cells that express the ligand, and moreover, these same cells additionally express the Nodal antagonists Lft1/2. Spreading of presumed long-range Nodal target genes, such as ta, that are activated beyond the ligand expression domain, is actually due to Fgf signaling, activated downstream of Nodal. Our data support a model whereby a temporal window for Nodal signaling activation dictates the dimensions of the Nodal signaling domain (Figure 7).

            "text": "The crucial determinant of the temporal window is the delayed translation of the Lft1/2 proteins, which is mediated by miR-430. In addition, maternally provided ndr1 transcripts and the production of Ndr1/2 by the YSL allow Nodal signaling to be initiated in the blastoderm, before transcription of lft1/2 ( Figure 7C). ndr1/2 expression in the YSL activates signaling in adjacent cells in the blastoderm. Because of positive feed-back, the blastoderm cells produce more Ndr1/2, while Lft1/2 levels remain relatively low because of the ubiquitous synthesis of miR-430. In these conditions, Nodal signaling can be activated in neighboring cells until extracellular Lft1/2 levels reach inhibitory concentrations. Therefore, the duration for which Lft1/2 levels are repressed dictates the size of the Nodal signaling domain. How the repressive action of miR-430 is lifted at 50% epiboly to allow Lft1/2 translation is not yet known and requires further investigation. Although inhibitory Lft1/2 levels prevent further activation of signaling, and hence additional spreading of Nodal signaling, cells already responding to Nodal will continue to signal for several hours, because this occurs from internalized receptors that are refractory to Lft1/2 inhibition. A consequence of our proposed mechanism is that cells directly adjacent to the YSL activate Nodal signaling for the longest duration. This likely explains the more intense P-Smad2 staining in these cells relative to those further from the margin. We therefore propose that Nodal signaling at the margin at blastula stages is dictated by an interplay among ligand, ligand antagonist, and a miRNA, with a differential in timing between ligand and antagonist production being the key determining factor. The size and shape of the Nodal signaling gradient had previously been thought to be regulated by a reaction-diffusion system (Meinhardt, 2009;M\u00fc ller et al., 2012;Schier, 2009). Here we propose an alternative mechanism whereby the size of the domain is dictated by the delay in Lefty translation. Although the Nodal/Lefty ligand/antagonist pair has many features of a reaction-diffusion system, we have uncovered one aspect that is incompatible. In reaction-diffusion models, which were originally conceived as pattern-forming chemical reactions, a homogeneous distribution of activator and inhibitor are unstable, and a local elevation of activator initiates formation of a gradient (Meinhardt, 2009). Integral to this model is the ability of the diffusing antagonist to immediately inhibit activator function at a distance. For Nodal and Lefty, this cannot happen, because once Nodal signaling is activated it occurs from internalized receptors and is therefore insensitive to Lefty inhibition, except over prolonged time frames.

We observe two graded signaling domains in Tg(ARE:eGFP) embryos that are both explained by timing of ligand exposure. During blastula stages, a shallow signaling gradient runs from dorsal to ventral. This is readily explained by the fact that dorsal cells are exposed to Nodal for a longer period than ventrolateral cells, because maternally provided Ndr1 signals dorsally before Ndr1/2 produced in the YSL induces signaling in the blastoderm margin. In addition, we found a clear vegetal-to-animal gradient within the ligand-expression domain using P-Smad2 immunostaining in late blastula-stage embryos, and we also observed that cells directly adjacent to the YSL expressed higher levels of all Nodal target genes, including the eGFP reporter gene, reflecting higher levels of signaling. Again, cells directly adjacent to the YSL are exposed to Ndr1/2 for the longest period of time. The importance of duration of exposure is further supported by our ex vivo experiments with dissociated embryonic cells. The long-term functional consequences of this were demonstrated in previously published work, which linked cell fates to the duration of exposure to Nodal signals (Hagos and Dougan, 2007). Thus, our model explains how concentration and duration of signaling can be translated into positional information. Finally, the importance of timing of signaling activation also rationalizes the normal development of ndr1 mutants (Feldman et al., 1998;Heisenberg and N\u00fc sslein-Volhard, 1997;Lim et al., 2013). Mesendoderm development in these mutants is largely normal, although delayed. This is explained by the fact that Ndr2 compensates for the lack of Ndr1, but its expression is delayed, because there is no maternal Ndr2.",

This finding seems to contradict lineagetracing studies that show that some mesodermal precursors are located up to 12 cell tiers away from the margin (e.g., see Dougan et al., 2003;Warga and N\u00fc sslein-Volhard, 1999). Although these lineage-tracing studies have provided valuable insight into the overall spatial distribution of mesendoderm precursors, they cannot themselves determine the extent of Nodal signaling. This is because although Nodal signaling is required for mesendoderm formation, not all cells that become mesendoderm have necessarily experienced Nodal signaling directly.",

Although in (B) Model of temporal window for Nodal signaling activation, controlled by miR-430 and Lft1/2. Ndr1/2 protein levels increase (dark blue line) over time because of autoregulation at low Lft1/2 concentrations (red line) until sufficient Lft1/2 is translated to inhibit signaling activation (pink shading) just before the onset of gastrulation. This process is controlled by miR-430s (green line, middle), which allows slow accumulation of signaling (light blue line, right). G, gastrulation; 1K, 1,000-cell stage. (C) In vivo mesendoderm induction over time according to the Nodal temporal window model. YSL-expressing Ndr1/2 is shown in purple; cells responding to Nodal are in blue, with dark blue denoting those experiencing the longest signaling duration. Cells expressing miR-430 are denoted with green nuclei, and pink shading depicts cells in which Lft1/2 levels have reached an inhibitory threshold. Note that by 50% epiboly the cells beyond the Nodal signaling domain are responding to Fgf, and this accounts for expression of mesodermal genes such as ta and fscn1a in these cells.

For whole-mount immunofluorescence, embryos were rehydrated to PBS and incubated in cold acetone at \u00c020 C for 20 min. Blocking and antibody incubations were performed in 10% FBS and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and washes were performed in PBS/1% Triton. The following primary antibodies were used: a-P-Smad2/3 (8828; Cell Signaling Technology) and a-P-Erk (M8159; Sigma). Note that because of the lack of Smad3 at blastula stages, we solely detect P-Smad2 with the a-P-Smad2/3 antibody. DAPI was used to stain nuclei, and images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. For quantification of P-Smad2 intensity in deep cells, MetaMorph Software (Molecular Devices) was used to generate P-Smad2 to DAPI ratios from at least three single optical slices per embryo, in three individual DMSO or SB-505124 treated, 50% epiboly embryos. Care was taken not to select mitotic or overlapping nuclei or nuclei from the enveloping layer. To measure the distance of a nucleus to the margin, a line was drawn laterally at the vegetal edge of the margin, and the distance to the nucleus perpendicular to the margin was measured using the MetaMorph Software. To normalize the staining intensity for each embryo, the average ratio of an area further than 11 cell tiers from the margin (>165 mm) was subtracted from each measurement. The data were divided in 15 mm bins, representing the average size of a deep cell at 50% epiboly (unpublished data; Dubrulle et al., 2015). The averages of the binned data for each cell tier, comparing DMSO and SB-505124 treatment, were used for testing for statistical significant differences using paired t tests with a 95% confidence interval.",
