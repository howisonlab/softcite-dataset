Finally, the ANN has the ability to predict the probability of BCR. Opinions vary regarding the comparison between ANN and LR. 9-14 Most criticism arises from the limited prediction accuracy due to limitations of the algorithm. 15,16 LR is a special form of ANN. If the relationships among input parameters are nonlinear, ANN models will perform better than LR. Otherwise, the LR is preferable because the influence of each parameter can be observed much easier than in ANNs. In this study, we describe the suitability of ANNs as a prediction tools for BCR. Evaluation of the ability of a computer model to predict of BCR after radical prostatectomy is mainly based on the following parameters: the accuracy of the predicting models, the universality of the internal/external validation, correction capability, complexity, and clinical value. 17 Here, we analyzed ANN and LR performance in predicting BCR based on these criteria. In addition to the ANN and LR models immediately after surgery, we analyzed ANN and LR models that evaluate BCR risk at 6-month intervals, which allows for a more",

Treatment of localized PCa is often performed by radical surgery such as laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP). 1 The PSA value in most patients will drop to zero within 2 months after LRP. A consecutive increase of serum PSA up to 0.1 or 0.2 ng ml \u22121 is defined as biochemical recurrence (BCR). 2 BCR is considered a predictor of clinical recurrence and metastasis of PCa. 3,4 Therefore, early identification and treatment of BCR is important to improve the long-term survival.",

For example, PSA, prostate volume, DRE, and other variables are used as input parameters for diagnosing PCa. 22 ANN is also used to predict the outcome of repeat prostate biopsies, 23 and furthermore, to predict the risk of lymph node metastasis in PCa patients. 24 However, ANN applications to predict BCR are rare. 7,10 Our data on BCR prediction show that ANN and LR models including the parameters PSA, margin status, pT and GS, can correctly simulate and reflect interactions between variables in the training set. The models improve the prediction better than any single variable and thus estimate BCR more accurately for each individual patient with PCa. 25 Some studies have verified that ANN models have the ability to improve prognosis prediction for PCa patients after prostatectomy. 7,10,[26][27][28][29] These data have been summarized in Table 5. One of the first studies in 1994 demonstrated 87% accuracy. 26 Among all available studies to date, the results by Tewari et al. 7 showed the best AUC with 0.83; however, their accuracy was somewhat lower than in the present study and in other studies. Potter et al. 26 gained similar AUCs of 0.71, 0.74, 0.74 using different input parameters, but the specificity was relatively lower than in our present study. However, despite large differences in sensitivity and specificity levels there are relatively small accuracy ranges (70%-87%) and AUCs between 0.71 and 0.83 for all studies. This demonstrates that the parameters that were used do not allow a better prediction of BCR. Interestingly, PSA has been thought to improve prediction of BCR following PCa diagnosis; 30 however in our study, %fPSA did not improve prognosis. The median values were not different between the non-BCR and BCR group (10.7 vs 9.2%; P = 0.26) ( Table 1).",
