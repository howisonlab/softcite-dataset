In order to conclude acceptable and thoughtout construction contracts, effective methodologies for their evaluation and comparison must be developed. In order to solve various legal problems, electronic legal decision support systems have been developed in the world. Application of the electronic legal decision support systems can help to navigate in the legal system easier, makes additional reading of legal acts redundant, creates opportunities to analyse decision variants and to select the most favourable one, provides users with the newest and most extensive information, enables quick search and can use classification and information transfer features. In order to conclude acceptable and well-thought construction contraction agreements, effective methodologies for their evaluation and comparison must be developed. In order to prepare such methodologies, it is necessary to analyse not only technical, organisational and economic aspects in construction but also legal aspects of a construction contraction agreement. Management of construction works includes conclusion of contracts between the client and the contractor. Contract making has great influence on economic success of both parties, on their behaviour in order to increase their profit and it can protect against possible loss. This article analyses construction contraction agreements by providing a model of construction contraction agreement provisions based on their functions. Construction contraction agreements should be concluded, evaluated and compared on the basis of this model. Values of indicators are determined and a multiple criteria decision support system is developed on the basis of this model."

Therefore, selection of a contractor is a very important stage while implementing an investment project. Patrick Sik-Wah Fong and Sonia Kit-Yung Choi [1] have analysed methods of contractors' selection and noted that some methods are non-exhaustive and tend to be biased: there is a lack of opportunities to evaluate abilities of a contractor and meet time, price, quality and security requirements at the same time. These authors have analysed possibilities to apply the Analytical Hi-erarchy Process (AHP) Method for contractor's selection according to different criteria.",

            "text": "Lord Diplock [2] has defined a construction contraction agreement (CCA) as: an agreement of sale of goods and work for a certain price, according to which payment is executed in parts after goods are delivered and works performed. Periodically, important decisions must be made related to matters such as correction of orders, size of intermediate expenditures, time inputs for the work related to the project. CCA conclusion and implementation differs from other manufacturing processes. An important fact, which must be thought over before concluding a CCA, is that construction of a building differs from industrial products made in a factory. The project scope, the conditions of the place, use of many construction materials and work variety are the reasons why it is impossible to achieve the same level of perfection as in a factory. It must be a new unique building, in which each bolt and brush stroke must be exact and in place. No special rules are applicable to such contracts, whether they are construction contraction or designing agreements. Lord Reid [2] has noted that when parties want to make detailed CCAs, it is impossible to apply any main rules or principles embracing contractual relationships between such parties, except for those which are used in general cases.",

Hinze and Tada [4] have analysed general provisions of agreements used in 52 US facility companies by paying attention to legal aspects. They determined that owners should thoroughly evaluate the aim of each province by general agreement provisions. Marsh, Kerzner and Hedley [5,6] have been trying to determine what aspects an agreement should include.

For example, agreement provisions regulating guarantees, surety or forfeit have the function of liability guarantee. All provisions regulating the aforementioned function may be joined to a separate subsystem. Similarly, other agreement provisions may also be joined to subsystems. Following the aforementioned principle, a hierarchical model of CCA provisions based on their functions has been made and provided in Fig. 1. While considering functions of agreement provisions they are joined to groups or, in other words, to subsystems. In their turn subsystems according to their functions are grouped into systems of higher level. At the end of the process, the highest point of the system of agreement provisions is reached, which coincides with the aim of the decision-making process. Thus the aim is specified at the first level of the hierarchy, i.e. the construction contraction agreement. The second level of hierarchy consists of criteria which make immediate influence on the final goal. At the same time each criterion is at the top of the created hierarchy, connecting to its top. The third level consists of criteria determined by the second level. Hierarchical structures are developed on the basis of transfer of authorisation, i.e. on the basis of subordination. Therefore, they cannot include horizontal relationships. Such relationships reflect not subordination but coordination [11].",

Stability means that slight modifications in the hierarchy cause very small changes. Flexibility means that introduction of several new criteria does not change the essence of a well-developed hierarchy. The used hierarchy has its own specific features, therefore, the following presumptions are offered for use [10] to the value of one indicator of a higher level, i.e. to one; e) any indicator is related only to one indicator of a higher level; f) the \"depth\" of structuring of separate indicators is different, and the structuring \"chain\" is inconsecutive. In order to evaluate CCAs and compare their different variants, it is not enough only to develop a model of agreement provisions. Striving to the aforementioned aims, it is necessary to determine the significance of structural elements of the developed model, i.e. of agreement provisions and groups of agreement provisions (model subsystems). Thus during evaluation or interpretation of evaluation results, different provisions of a CAA may be treated differently. In turn, it may cause certain misunderstandings, create erroneous results or cause erroneous interpretation of the results. Therefore, it is very important to describe each CCA provision in detail.",

Otherwise, people will simply fail to evaluate the available information properly and to make proper choice with the increasing flood of information. This opinion is based on statistical data, which shows that the amount of information in a company increases twice annually. An employee can analyse only about 5 % of the received information effectively in such a situation and assistance becomes vital [12]. Such situation shapes a number of tasks for a decision support system.",

First, a system must be developed inside the organisation, and such system with a simple user interface would provide access to and exchange of information among company's employees. A clear link between the decision support system and various data must be provided and it must facilitate installation of various means for resource allocation. In this case, accessibility of the system can be achieved by using standard graphic user interface. Such standardisation is the main reason why Microsoft Windows and related products have become widely distributed so fast. The main problem of decision support systems is an interface with additional means that is difficult to implement. From the perspective of a user of a decision support system, the main criterion when a system for work is being selected is the simplicity of its user interface."

            "text": "A common principle dominating in Europe is that contracts are valid despite their execution; however, laws sometimes provide for formal requirements, for example, contracts must be made in writing. First, this legal requirement attempts to reduce the number of disputes, because contracts allow explicit determination of rights and liabilities of parties. Second, it is an attempt to guarantee movement of goods and services, because they make clear who must perform what actions, under what conditions and what limitations are applicable. Third, such formalities allow parties to know their rights and liabilities explicitly months and years after conclusion of a contract, because it is possible to store the contents of the document. However, laws providing for formalities may have other aims as well: they may make an attempt at a psychological effect. In this case it is attempted to make a person think about the risk and dangers before signing a contract, at least a little. A relevant example of such contracts are loan contracts; they are considered dangerous, because consumers are often allured by advertisements, etc. and thus fail to realise the accepted financial liabilities fully and fail to evaluate their economic potential. For this reason, the EU Directive No. 87/102/EEC On Consumer Loans determines that a consumer loan must be executed in the written form. E-commerce understands that e-contracts lack expressiveness and that the button \"I agree/accept\" contract provisions do not have the same psychological effect as written documents. Therefore, the European Union doubled the steps of contract conclusion (offer and acceptance) and established a four-stage process (offer, acceptance, acknowledgement that the offer is received and acknowledgement that the acceptance is received), which was reduced to three stages in the later edition of the EU Directive No. 2000/31/EC; so now the recipient must give its consent by technological means in order to express its consent to conclude a contract, and the contract is considered as concluded from the moment the service recipient receives an electronic acknowledgement of the provider, that received the consent of the recipient (acceptance). Member states supplement their laws by the provision that different steps of the process of e-contract conclusion shall be provided explicitly and defined so that parties shall be familiarized with their contents and procedure and that any steps shall be made only upon expressing consent of the parties. In such case, these requirements of explicitness shall serve for equalisation of the conventional and electronic consent and shall not provide for the reinforced consent required by the nature of some contracts (e.g. consumer loan)."

The author thinks that e-signatures are as authentic as handwritten signatures. EU Directive No. 1999/93/EC on E-signature specifies that member states shall grant secure e-signatures based on qualified certificates and created by secure e-signature development means. Such e-signatures meet legal requirements of relationship between a signature and data stored or kept in electronic form, the same as handwritten signatures meet these requirements in respect of data stored or kept on paper. Classic civil law considers a contract as a result of expression of two wills. If the will is not present or is faulty, the main element of a contract is missing. Nobody can be bound by a contract against his/her will. Should the modern law know only these features of contract making, it would become a serious barrier to validate contracts concluded by e-agents, which may be controlled by a third party (e.g. e-shop)."

Sometimes negligent actions of a party are used as a basis, for example, a party was negligent in selection of contract phrases and was not attentive enough to remove the circumstances because of which somebody was considered its representative. Sometimes it is made objective by an opinion that parties accept responsibility for the selected means of contract conclusion."

There is a considerably strong basis to claim that nobody can be exempt from an obligation to fulfil a contract only because an e-agent was an intermediary in its conclusion. The problem is related to settlement of errors made by e-agents. Another problem is related to a question whether it is allowed to exempt a party from liabilities under a contract if it proves that the error occurred due to technical problems of an e-agent."

Such conclusion can be made for the following reasons: first, experts can easier evaluate significance of agreement provisions grouped according to their functions and, second, legal power of all CCA provisions is equal, irrespective of the group they are attributed to according to any of the analysed classifications. However, the latter classification illustrates real operation of a CCA and its functions best."

The calculations provided as an example enable the following conclusion: although the aforementioned software has a number of advantages, several main disadvantages can also be distinguished. The software is designed for stationary workstations. Thus the developed hierarchical model of CCA evaluation criteria can be only an extramodule of the aforementioned software. Whereas users who do not have specialised software cannot use the developed system of criteria. Although the system foresees a possibility to place hierarchy models in the Internet, only Expert Choice software users can use them to full extent. Considering the results of the analysis, a specialised decision support system should be developed for CCA evaluation; the system would implement advantages of an Internet-based system."
