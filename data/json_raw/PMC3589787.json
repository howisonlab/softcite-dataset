Seven nuclear genomic loci were evaluated to determine those best suited for identifying species of Mycosphaerella and/or its associated anamorphs. These genes included \u03b2-tubulin (Btub), internal transcribed spacer regions of the nrDNA operon (ITS), 28S nrDNA (LSU), Actin (Act), Calmodulin (Cal), Translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1\u03b1) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2). Loci were tested on their Kimura-2-parameter-based inter-and intraspecific variation, PCR amplification success rate and ability to distinguish between quarantine species and closely related taxa. Results showed that none of these loci was solely suited as a reliable barcoding locus for the tested fungi. A combination of a primary and secondary barcoding locus was found to compensate for individual weaknesses and provide reliable identification. A combination of ITS with either EF-1\u03b1 or Btub was reliable as barcoding loci for EPPO A1/A2-listed Mycosphaerella species. Furthermore, Lecanosticta acicola was shown to represent a species complex, revealing two novel species described here, namely L. brevispora sp. nov. on Pinus sp. from Mexico and L. guatemalensis sp. nov. on Pinus oocarpa from Guatemala. Epitypes were also designated for L. acicola and L. longispora to resolve the genetic application of these names."

There are currently almost 350 pest and quarantine organisms, covering bacteria, phytoplasmas, fungi, parasitic plants, insects and mites, nematodes, virus and virus-like organisms on the EPPO A1 (currently absent from the EPPO region) and A2 (locally present but controlled in the EPPO region) lists of organisms that require standardised protocols against introduction into, and spread within, the EPPO region. Under QBOL, informative loci from the selected quarantine species and their taxonomically related species were subjected to DNA barcoding from voucher specimens in order to produce reliable DNA barcode sequences that are made publicly available through an online and searchable database called Q-bank (www.q-bank. eu) (Bonants et al. 2010). Within the QBOL project, the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre (Utrecht, The Netherlands), was tasked with barcoding the Mycosphaerella complex (order Capnodiales, class Dothideomycetes) on the EPPO A1/A2 lists and their taxonomically related closest sister species (Table 1).",

Mostly, Mycosphaerella s.l. consists of foliicolous plant pathogens which are the cause of significant economical losses in both temperate and tropical crops worldwide (Crous et al. 2001). The Mycosphaerella teleomorph morphology is relatively conserved, but is linked to more than 30 anamorph genera (Crous 2009). Although originally assumed to be monophyletic (Crous et al. 2001), phylogenetic analyses of numerous Mycosphaerella species and their anamorphs by Hunter et al. (2006) and Crous et al. (2007) have shown that the Myco sphaerella complex is in fact polyphyletic. This has since led to taxonomic redistribution of most of the phylogenetic clades within the complex, although several clades remain unresolved due to limited sampling (Crous 2009, Crous et al. 2009a.",

The ITS locus is easily amplified and gives a good species resolution in many fungal groups. Lack of sufficient ITS interspecies variation within some genera of Mycosphaerellalike fungi (e.g. Septoria, Cercospora and Pseudocercospora) DNA barcoding of Mycosphaerella species of quarantine importance to Europe W.

Fresh collections were made from leaves of diverse hosts by placing material in damp chambers for 1-2 d. Single conidial colonies were established from sporulating conidiomata on Petri dishes containing 2 % malt extract agar (MEA) as described earlier by Crous et al. (1991). Colonies were sub-cultured onto potato-dextrose agar (PDA), oatmeal agar (OA), MEA (Crous et al. 2009b), and pine needle agar (PNA) (Lewis 1998), and incubated at 25 \u00b0C under continuous near-ultraviolet light to promote sporulation. Morphological descriptions are based on slide preparations mounted in clear lactic acid from colonies sporulating on PNA. Observations were made with a Zeiss V20 Discovery stereo-microscope, and with a Zeiss Axio Imager 2 light microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination and an AxioCam MRc5 camera and software. Colony characters and pigment production were noted after 1 mo of growth on MEA, PDA and OA (Crous et al. 2009b) incubated at 25 \u00b0C. Colony colours (surface and reverse) were rated according to the colour charts of Rayner (1970).

The primary cause for the existing Kimura-2-parameter overlap within the test loci is the low interspecific variation between the Pseudocercospora species used in this dataset. Excluding the Pseudocercospora species from the analyses (data not shown) removed the existing Kimura-2 overlap for RPB2, EF-1\u03b1 and Btub, while reducing it significantly in Act. Excluding these Pseudocercospora species had only negligible effect on the ITS and LSU Kimura-2-parameter overlap (i.e. their lack of variation is more universal).

As the disease progresses, lesions coalesce and cause defoliation and dieback. Over several years this may lead to branch and tree death (Evans 1984, Barnes et al. 2004, EPPO 2012. Based on LSU data, L. acicola clusters in a unique clade within the Mycosphaerellaceae, for which Crous et al. (2009c) chose the generic name Lecanosticta (based on L. acicola). The name Mycosphaerella dearnessii is no longer applicable, as Myco sphaerella s.str. is linked to the genus Ramularia (Verkley et al. 2004, Crous et al. 2009c. The correct name for this species should therefore be Lecanosticta acicola. Quaedvlieg & Crous, sp. nov. -Myco Bank MB801940;Fig. 4 Etymology. Named after its relatively short conidia.",

Notes -Lecanosticta longispora is distinguished from the other taxa within the genus by either Btub or EF-1\u03b1.

Notes -Mycosphaerella laricisleptolepidis is the causal agent of needle cast of Japanese larch. This disease is endemic to East Asia and Japan where it occurs on indigenous Larix species. It causes brown necrotic lesions on the needles that coalesce, leading to defoliation, stunted growth and even host plant death (Kobayashi 1980, EPPO 2012. Based on LSU data, M. laricisleptolepidis clusters in a clade described as 'Polythrincium' by Crous et al. (2009c). Although the genus Mycosphaerella s.str. is distinct from the 'Polythrincium' clade, the name M. laricisleptolepidis is retained until more data becomes available. Specimens examined. anGola, Bi\u00e9, from Citrus sinensis, Dec. 1953, T. de Carvalho & O. Mendes, holotype IMI 56597, ex-type CBS 149.53. -ziMBaBwE, from Citrus sp., March 1993ibid., from Citrus sp., 2002, P.W. Crous, CPC 4111 = CBS 112748;ibid., from Citrus sp., Sept. 2002, M.C. Pretorius, CBS H-20851, CPC 4118 = CBS 112933;ibid., from Citrus sp., 2002, P.W. Crous, CPC 4117 = CBS 115645. Notes -Pseudocercospora angolensis is the causal agent of Citrus leaf spot (Citrus fruit spot) and is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, where it occurs on all major Citrus species. It causes greenish yellow lesions on leaves and fruit that coalesce and turn necrotic, leading to defoliation or abscission of young fruit (Timmer et al. 2000, EPPO 2012. Based on LSU data, P. angolensis clusters within the Pseu docercospora clade (Pretorius et al. 2003, Crous et al. 2009c). As the genus Pseudocercospora is taxonomically correct and in current use, Pseudocercospora angolensis is the correct name for the causal agent of Citrus fruit leaf spot. Notes -Pseudocercospora pinidensiflorae is the causal agent of brown needle blight of pine (Cercospora pine blight). This disease is mostly endemic to the tropics and subtropics in Brazil, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast and East Asia, where it may infect indigenous Pinus spp. It causes brown necrotic lesions on the needles leading to defoliation and is especially damaging on young saplings, on which defoliation leads to stunted growth and host plant death (Deighton 1987, Lewis 1998, EPPO 2012. Based on LSU data, isolates of P. pinidensiflorae cluster within the Pseudocercospora clade (Crous et al. In press), confirming its generic placement as reported by Deighton (1987). The generic name Mycosphaerella is considered a synonym of the genus Ramularia (Verkley et al. 2004, Crous et al. 2009c, and therefore Mycosphaerella should not be used for the pathogen associated with brown needle blight of pine. The application of the name Pseudocercospora pinidensiflorae is therefore correct.",

It causes leaf lesions that coalesce until the leaves turn necrotic, leading to defoliation and severe losses in crop production (Stevenson 2001, EPPO 2012. Based on LSU data, S. malagutii clusters within Septoria s.str. as defined by Quaedvlieg et al. (2011). The correct name for this species is therefore Septoria malagutii (Cline & Rossman 2006).    Notes -Septoria musiva is the causal agent of Septoria canker of poplar and is endemic to North America and Argentina, where it occurs on all native Populus spp. It causes severe cankering and die-back and is especially damaging to hybrid Populus species (Bier 1939, Waterman 1954, Ostry 1987, Dickmann 2001, EPPO 2012. Based on LSU data, S. musiva clusters within Septoria s.str. as defined by Quaedvlieg et al. (2011). However, ongoing work by Quaedvlieg and Verkley (unpubl. data) revealed that S. musiva is located in a cryptic phylogenetic lineage sister to Septoria s.str., and therefore the genus name of this clade might change in the future.",

The rapid advance of molecular techniques in recent years has underlined the limitations of identifications based solely on morphology and/or ITS sequencing. Examples of this are the new Lecanosticta species that have been described during this study. These isolates had previously been identified as Lecanosticta acicola based both on morphology and limited ITS sequencing. The sequencing of additional loci revealed that L. acicola actually represented a species complex rather than a single species. This is yet another example of the tenet of  which states \"Show me a plant pathogen, and I will show you a species complex\". Another example was the Cercospora apii complex, which was considered to be a single species based on morphology , but which was found to represent several species when DNA sequencing techniques where employed (Crous et al. 2004b, 2006a, In press, Groenewald et al. 2005). This inability to discriminate between cryptic species and their dependency on mature, sporulating cultures make morphology-based techniques poorly suited for the rapid and reliable identification of Mycosphaerella species on trade goods. PCR-RFLP-based methods work on a 'hit or miss' principle, and work well for identifying small groups of well-characterised fungal species with little genetic variation. Unfortunately these methods lack the inherent ability to cope with expanding natural variation. Point mutations, insertion or deletion events can lead to the loss of restriction sites, making isolates unrecognizable for PCR-RFLP based methods (Majer et al. 1996). Species of Mycosphaerella also co-colonize lesions, increasing the chance of having a mixed DNA sample if single-spored or hyphal-tipped colonies are not used in the assay .",

Hebert et al.

The authors proposed that a locus should have a mean inter-/ intraspecific distance ratio of at least 10, to be suitable as a barcoding locus. The loci tested in this study all had mean inter-, intraspecific distance ratios that were much higher than 10. Mean distribution ratios varied from 486 for LSU to 69 for ITS (Fig. 2). By these criteria alone, these loci should all be suitable barcoding loci. Almost all loci showed a Kimura-2-parameter overlap between their absolute inter-and intraspecific distribution frequencies. When the Pseudocer cospora isolates were included in the dataset, the size of this absolute inter-and intraspecific distribution frequencies data overlap varied from 12 % (LSU), 16 % (ITS), 3.4 % (Act), 1.2 % (EF-1\u03b1), 0.6 % (RPB2), 0.5 % (Btub) and 0 % (Cal), respectively.
