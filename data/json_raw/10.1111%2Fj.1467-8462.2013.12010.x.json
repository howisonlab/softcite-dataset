This was first started in 1968 on a large scale with the American Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), housed at the University of Michigan. Indeed, this dataset continues to provide invaluable data on generations of individuals in households concerning topics, such as educational attainment, housing situations and income and employment dynamics, and was described in detail by Hill (1991).",

It built upon many ideas that had been established in the American PSID and introduced a hierarchical data structure to manage the complicated data at different levels, such as person, household, roster and sampled and over time. This structure is documented in Haisken-DeNew and Frick (2005). In 1991, the British Household Panel Study (BHPS) was introduced to cover the population of Great Britain. Taylor et al.

            "text": "The key to retrieving data from a dataset is to understand the data file and variable naming scheme. The PSID system used a simple variable-naming scheme, in which variables were sequentially numbered (that is, v1 followed by v2 and v3). This reached a limit in 1993 with the variable v23363 and, in 1994, the 'early release' (er) files started a new variable name scheme with er2001, which was followed by er2002 and so on. Due to the sequential naming of the variables, a range of variables was found in the family file for 1968, another range of variables for 1969 and so on. However, one had no way of knowing the variable name of another year, given the variable name of a particular year. When the German SOEP addressed the issue of variable names, it followed the hierarchical structure of the data. Thus, the variable name ap3301 referred to the 'a' wave (1984), 'p' at the person level and the 33rd question of the person questionnaire, but specifically the first part of that multi-part question. However, there was no guarantee that the next year would follow suit in the variable naming. The BHPS went first into 'speaking variable names', in which the variable names no longer identified the order of the variable in a dataset, but rather the content and the year in which this content was collected. For instance, the variable rmovjb asked in the 'r' wave refers to 'moved for employment reasons'.",

For instance, 'ws' refers to 'wages and salaries'. The variable jwscmg asked in the 'j' wave (or 2010) deals with wages and salaries (ws) but specifically addresses 'Main job, current weekly gross wages & salary'. Indeed, the same variable 1 year previously ('i' wave) is called deterministically iwscmg. By adding a wave indicator, a broad category indicator and 'speaking names', the HILDA Survey's variable names are moderately identifiable in content, even if one has never seen the specific question or questionnaire before. Clearly, data structure and variable-naming schemes have evolved over time.",

In addition, there is a master file which contains entries for each person who has ever entered into the HILDA Survey sample. The master file allows one to use this as a starting point and define the sample immediately (that is, a sample of only men, from 2001 to 2004). The (longitudinal) person identifier xwaveid is consistent over time and data files. The HILDA Survey, on the other hand, has no concept of a longitudinal household. All persons aged 15 and over are interviewed directly. Longitudinal identifiers for spouses, mothers, fathers etc. are also available, such that one could retrieve data on individual wages and of the spouse and use the variables in the same regression. See Wooden and Watson (2007) and Wooden, Freidin and Watson (2002) for more information. Following this structure, the dataset 'Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life' (MABEL), labour market survey of doctors, also uses a longitudinal person identifier xwaveid and also a one-letter wave indicator and a two-letter classification scheme for each variable. Thus, the variable ajshw refers to the 'a' wave (2008) and 'js' to 'job satisfaction' and the remaining 'hw' refers to 'hours of work'. This variable is called bjshw in the following wave and so on.

Users are not required to write data retrieval programs, as PanelWhiz generates and runs extraction code on the fly, based on the variables selected. Due to its common interface and implementation for many datasets, it is useful for international comparative work and allows for an easy introduction to a new dataset for first-time users. As the data retrievals are standardised and used by many researchers, the chance of mistakes in the initial data-creation phase of any research is virtually reduced to zero. Updates to PanelWhiz are pushed to users and are installed in the same manner as Stata itself. PanelWhiz currently has more than 300 users and currently supports international datasets such as the German SOEP, the British BHPS (or its successor, the UK Understanding Society study), the American PSID and Current Population Survey-National Bureau of Economic Research, the American Survey of Income and Program Participation, the South African National Income Dynamics Study, in addition to the HILDA Survey, MABEL, LSAC, LSIC and CASiE. PanelWhiz runs in Windows, Mac and Linux, but needs at least Stata SE/MP 11 or later to run.",
