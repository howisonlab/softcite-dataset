Initial vital signs were: blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, pulse rate of 86/min, respiratory rate of 20/min, and body temperature of 37.1\u00b0C. Laboratory investigations showed Hb 11.2 g/dL, leukocyte count 8.61 \u00d7 10 9 / L, platelet count 188 \u00d7 10 9 /L, AST/ALT 65/123 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 151 IU/L, and elevated C-reactive protein level 155.7 mg/dL. Chest computerized tomography revealed intramural hematomas over the entire thoracic and proximal abdomi-nal aorta. On the day after admission, the patient presented with fever (38.3\u00b0C). Blood samples for culture were inoculated into 3 sets of Bact/ALERT FA and FN bottles (bioM\u00e9rieux Inc., Durham, NC, USA). Gram-positive coccobacilli from 1 pair of FA and FN bottles were isolated. After incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 hr, small-sized \u03b1-hemolytic colonies were observed on sheep blood agar (Fig. 1). The organism was identified as gram-positive coccobacilli (Fig. 2). It was negative for oxidase, catalase, pyrrolidonyl-arylamidase, and leucine aminopeptidase and had a positive bile-esculin reaction. The minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin was determined to be > 256 \u00b5g/mL by using Etest strip (AB bioM\u00e9rieux, Solna, Sweden). The isolate was initially assumed to be a Leuconostoc species because of its biochemical characterizations and vancomycin resistance. It was subsequently identified as Streptococcus equinus and Aerococcus viridans according to the gram-positive identification card of the Vitek 1 and the gram-positive card of the Vitek 2 systems (bioM\u00e9rieux Inc.), respectively. For further identification, matrixassisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS, VITEK MS system, bioM\u00e9rieux Inc.) was used. Mass spectra were acquired by using the Axima Assurwww.annlabmed.org http://dx.doi.org/10.3343/alm.2013.33.6.459 ance mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and analyzed with the VITEK MS IVD v1 database (bioM\u00e9rieux Inc.). The strain was identified as W. confusa, which has a similar biochemical profile to that of Leuconostoc [1], with a confidence value of 99.9%. In addition, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing of a PCR product sized about 1.5 kb by using the universal primers 8F (5'-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3') and 1541R (5'-AAG GAG GTG ATC CAG CCG CA-3') and compared the obtained sequence with the EzTaxon database [9] and the bioinformatic bacterial identification database [10]. When the sequence was submitted to the ExTaxon database, the isolate revealed 99.66% similarity (1, A phylogenetic tree, which was constructed with the neighborjoining method by using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 5.05 [11], revealed this isolate to be W. confusa (Fig. 3).",

Among the 43 isolates, which were identified as either Lactobacillus or Leuconostoc species using commercial identification systems, 10 isolates were confirmed as W. confusa using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and all affected patients had complex medical conditions and/or an immunocompromised status. In additional reports, W. confusa isolates could not be identified using conventional identification systems except by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, and most patients were immunocompromised [2][3][4]6]. When clinical isolates cannot be identified by using conventional methods, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis can be useful [13]. However, routine application of 16S rRNA gene sequencing has some limitations since it is relatively expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, MALDI-TOF MS can identify bacteria within a few minutes using colonies grown on culture plates, and it can reduce the turnaround time and the cost of expendables [14]. During the past several years, there have been numerous reports demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of the MALDI-TOF MS system [15][16][17][18].",
