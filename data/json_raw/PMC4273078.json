[Subjects and Methods] The study was a randomized controlled trial. Twenty-seven undergraduate nursing students were randomly selected, with 12 assigned to an exercise group and 15 assigned to a control group. The yogic exercises intervention was undertaken for 60 minutes one day a week for 12 weeks. It consisted of physical exercise (surya namaskara) combined with relaxation and meditation (shavasana and yoga nidra). Life stress was measured by the Life Stress Scale for College Students, and postprandial blood glucose levels were measured with a digital glucometer. [Results] The exercise group measurements were significantly decreased in both life stress and postprandial blood glucose levels compared with the control group. [Conclusion] These findings indicate that yogic exercises would reduce life stress and lower postprandial blood glucose levels in nursing students.",

Nursing students are constantly under various stressors such as academic performance, isolation from the group, change in environment, change in food type, irregular diet, clinical challenges, economic problems, future prospects, problems with the value system of current society, self-expectations, and expectations from family and peers etc [1][2][3][4][5][6] . If these stressors are not managed properly, they can have negative effects on the physical and psychological health of nursing students [1][2][3] . Furthermore, these problems can cause academic failure and/or limited growth as a valuable employee 2,4,7) . Therefore, it is necessary to put in place various activities and behaviors to prevent and reduce life stress in nursing students 4,[6][7] .",

The mechanisms by which yoga influences well-being are likely complex biochemical and physiological mechanisms consisting of reduced sympathetic nervous tone, activation of antagonistic neuromuscular systems, and stimulation of the limbic system 9) . Therefore, yoga has been reported to lower levels of sympathetic hormones. That is to say, breathing exercises during yoga practice reduce sympathetic tone, increases parasympathetic activity, and help to reduce stress in yoga practictioners 10) . Meditation also brings about a hypometabolic state and reduces stress induced by sympathetic overactivity 11) .",

Cyclic yoga exercises refers to surya namaskara and yoga nidra. Surya namaskara translates as \"sun salutations,\" and this type of yoga is composed of 12 postures and breathing exercises. Also yoga nidra, which means \"psychic sleep,\" is a specific yogic relaxation and meditation practice 19) . The cyclic yoga performed in this study consisted of the following practices (Table 1). Under the guidance and supervision of the yoga expert, after practicing 10 cycles of surya namaskara for 20 minutes, the subjects performed the shavasana pose for 5 minutes of relaxation. Finally, the subjects performed yoga nidra. Yoga nidra is performed in the shavasana pose.

These findings are similar to the findings of Simard and Henry, who found that Perceived Stress Scale levels significantly decreased from baseline to mid-term, an improvement that persisted to the end of the intervention 15) . They assessed the impact of a short yoga intervention on female medical students' health for a 16-week period. They also pointed out that a yoga intervention may be effective in decreasing stress and improving general well-being in medical students. Besides, the findings of Beets & Mitchell indicated that despite short yoga program exposure, acute changes in mental health indicators such as stress were observed 20) . Similarly, the findings of Yoshihara et al. suggested that yoga can improve mental health status and has implications for the prevention of psychosomatic symptoms in healthy women 17) . In addition, Sharma systematically reviewed 17 articles related to yoga for stress management 8) . As a result, they reported that of the 17 studies, 12 demonstrated positive changes in psychological or physiological outcomes related to stress. Like the previous studies, the present study also supports the paradigm that yoga exercise can have beneficial effects in reducing psychological problems such as stress in nursing students.",

Over the past 2 decades, many forms of intervention have been suggested to help nursing students with their stress. Most recently, one researcher recommended biofeedback, humor, peer instructors, mentors, and mindfulness training interventions for stress centered around academic challenges in nursing students 2,5,6,[21][22][23] . However, no recent studies have been conducted with a new generation of yoga exercises to help Table 2. Homogeneity test for age, life stress, and blood glucose level between the experimental and control group reduce nursing students' stress. Ultimately, these findings suggest that the nursing students in the yoga exercise group were able to control the same level of stress over the 12week period even though they experienced more stressors and demands from their academic conditions. It is very important for nurse educators to help nursing students manage their stress in order to prevent additional problems.",

This finding is similar to that of Shende et al., who found that both fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels were significantly improved in the yoga group, whereas there was no significant improvement in the postprandial blood glucose levels in their control group not practicing yoga pranayama 4) . They assessed the effect of pranayama on the blood glucose level of 60 medical students and found that a short-term intervention of yogic exercise helps in reducing the stress in medical students, which is reflected by improvement in both fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels. They also emphasized that the beneficial effects of yoga on fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels are well documented. As stated, most of these studies have been done on patients with known diseases. However, there is very little data available on the effect of yoga exercise composed of surya namaskara (which means sun salutations) and yoga nidra (which means psychic sleep) on the blood glucose levels in healthy subjects. The findings of the present study also support those of Jensen, Stevens, and Kenny, who stated that yoga nidra is related to psychoneuro-physiological parameters 24) . Numerous studies have shown yoga to have an immediate downregulating effect on both the pineal and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to stress [12][13][14][15] . The performance of asana led to increased sensitivity of the B cells of the pancreas to the glucose signal. It also increased the sensitivity of the progressive long-term effect of asanas. Therefore, it was also found that brief yoga-based relaxation training normalizes the functions of the autonomic nervous system 15) . As shown in previous studies, the findings of the present study suggest that yogic exercises can improve stress and stress biomarkers in nursing students. However, follow-up studies will be needed to evaluate the effect on biochemical parameters of stress such as cortisol and blood glucose in nursing students. To my knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the effect of yoga exercise on the blood glucose level of healthy nursing students.",
