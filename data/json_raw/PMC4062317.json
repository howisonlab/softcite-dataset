Materials and methods: Between-and within-day coeffi cients of variation (CVs) of both assays were calculated using control samples provided by the test manufacturers. Samples from 90 subjects were collected and INR values were determined in a double-blind parallel manner employing both systems. Results: The within-day coeffi cients of variation (CVs) in INR estimates ranged from 2.6% (INR = 1.12) to 3.1% (INR = 2.51) for the Steelex system and from 2.1% (INR = 1.09) to 1.8% (INR = 2.8) for the Pacifi c test; the between-day values ran from 3.4% (INR = 1.16) to 7.9% (INR = 2.64) and from 3.3% (INR = 1.1) to 2.3% (INR = 2.7), respectively. Passing-Bablok fi t of the of the Steelex and Pacifi c methods yielded the equation: Steelex INR = 0.85 (0.79-0.91) \u00d7 Pacifi c INR + 0.12 (-0.02-0.21), whereas the CUSUM linearity P value was < 0.01. The mean bias as determined by the Bland-Altman test was-0.156 (-0.912-0.600). Conclusion: The results obtained using Steelex reagents and the M600H coagulometer are not equivalent to those obtained using Pacifi c Hemostasis reagents and a Teco Coatron A4 coagulometer, at least in the therapeutic range.",

            "text": "Prothrombin time (PT) is the most common coagulation test performed in the clinical laboratory. PT is used to detect abnormalities in the extrinsic coagulation pathway. PT measurement is critical when thrombotic patients are on oral anticoagulant therapy. However, it can be diffi cult to compare PT test results from diff erent laboratories (1); standardization is essential. Thromboplastin, the principal reagent of the PT assay, is commercially available in diff erent forms. To achieve the required standardization, all thromboplastin preparations should be calibrated using the Internation-al Sensitivity Index (ISI) and PT results should be presented in International Normalized Ratio (INR) units (2). The WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization has decreed that standardization requires a comparison of results yielded by the test thromboplastin with those aff orded when a reference thromboplastin is employed (2,3). However, it is clear that standardization is not universally performed (4)(5)(6)(7).",

Accurate INR estimation is crucial (20). Global harmonization of INR results, and agreement on the therapeutic ranges associated with varying clinical indications, is important (21). Many factors infl uence INR values; these include the levels of various coagulation factors present and their interaction with thromboplastin reagents diff ering in composition and sensitivity to the actions of such factors (22). It can be diffi cult to obtain accurate and precise INR measurements. Both PT and INR data should be identical regardless of the reagents, instrument, or test method used. However, agreement among results yielded by many commercial INR methods is poor. Such variations may compromise patient care (1,7).",

(28) found intra-individual INR variation of 4% and inter-individual variation of 6.8%. Kjeldsen (29) recorded in-treatment intra-individual INR variation of 10.1%. Via computer simulation of serial INR measurements within the generally accepted therapeutic range (INR 2.0-3.0), the cited author concluded that analytical imprecision should be less than 5% and analytical bias less than \u00b1 0.2 INR units (29). In the present study, the overall analytical bias was indeed less than \u00b1 0.2 INR units, but, in the therapeutic range, the bias was greater than \u00b1 0.2 INR units, thus signifi cantly higher than current recommendations (28,29). It is evident that ISI strongly infl uences INR inter-laboratory variability (30). Although the ISI assigned by the manufacturer of the Steelex M600H coagulometer was relatively low (1.18), a major limitation of our study is that local ISI calibration using WHO-certifi ed plasma was not performed. Incorrect assignment of ISI values by manufacturers may cause among-method diff erences in test results.",
