However, these rigid local fragments reorient themselves with respect to one another during the conformational change, resulting in poor global alignment. A good example is large-scale domain movement. Consider the HECT domain of the human ubiquitin ligase WWP1, which is homologous to the human ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Comparing their crystal structures [PDB codes 1D5F:C (2) and 1ND7 (3)] reveals a dramatic conformational change ( Figure 1) crucial for their biological function, which is to move the ubiquitin molecule from one substrate protein to another.",

However, both rigid and flexible structural alignment methods focus on finding a single best fit between the protein structures, and may ignore small yet significant conformational changes. Consider, for example, the relatively simple case of a same protein in two conformations. Given the bound and unbound structures [PDB codes 3MBP (10) and 1LLS:A (11)] of the maltose-binding protein, two popular structural alignment methods, CE (12) and FATCAT (13), align the entire structures together without recognizing the hinge-like conformational change occurring between the two domains of the protein. FlexProt 14, on the other hand, requires the user to know the number of hinges in order to interpret its results. What we need in this case is a method that automatically detects the 'discontinuity' in structural similarity at the hinge due to the conformational change and matches the two domains on each side of the hinge separately. See Figure 2 for a comparison between the results from FATCAT and pFlexAna. In general, pFlexAna aims to detect such conformational changes for two related, but different proteins. Furthermore, it tries to identify and group together those protein fragments that move in tandem.",

The parameter k is the desired number of clusters for grouping  the aligned fragments together, and is the noise parameter, which determines how strictly structural similarity is applied. For low -values, pFlexAna matches only fragments that are highly similar. For high -values, it also matches fragments with weak similarity and ignores small differences. Based on our experiences, -values between 0.2 and 0.4 work well for proteins with reasonably highsequence homology (40% or higher). For proteins that are even more distantly related, we find -values up to 0.8 to be useful as well, though this may lead to false positive matches in some cases."

In the second step, pFlexAna clusters the aligned fragment pairs into 'super-alignments', according to the similarity of geometric transformations that align two fragments in a pair.

First, we match the residues of the two proteins by 'sliding' one protein against the other (Figure 4). For each sliding position, let P and P 0 represent the matched residues from the two proteins, respectively. We generate all contiguous fragments of P and P 0 and check their structural similarity by applying a reliable statistical test (4). Briefly, this test uses a Gaussian noise model to represent acceptable deviations in atomic coordinates between two putatively similar protein fragments. Two fragments are considered statistically different if their coordinates deviate too much according to the Gaussian model. We then assign to each residue a flexibility score that incorporates information from all fragment comparisons that involve this residue. A high score indicates greater rigidity. Finally, each pair of aligned fragments must pass the following filter: the fragments must consist entirely of residues whose flexibility scores are above a threshold, and they must be longer than a given minimum length. Intuitively, this filter ensures that such a pair of fragments and all subfragments contained in them are structurally identical up to statistical variations. The minimum length requirement is imposed to avoid accidental structural matches. One advantage of our method is that it highlights the genuine conformational changes by suppressing the spurious ones due to noise. More details on this method and its advantages are available in ref. (  exhaustive comparison of all contiguous fragments in the two protein structures, our method can detect structurally similar fragments that are in opposite order along the protein sequences.",

There is an edge between every two vertices, and the associated edge weight represents the similarity between the fragment pairs corresponding to the two vertices.

Figure 5 shows the alignments of 1MOQ and 8ABP. pFlexAna finds two independent domains. Each aligned domain centers around a parallel b-sheet buried by a-helices. In this figure, each alignment is rotated for viewing down the plane of an aligned sheet. To see the magnitude of the domain movement, note that the N-terminal domain of 8ABP (magenta) appears in the upper-right of both views, and 1MOQ (orange) is dramatically shifted between the two alignments.

In particular, we set parameter k = 1 when we expect only a single cluster corresponding to the aligned protein core. For example, Figure 6 compares two PX domain proteins [1KMD (19) and 1GD5 (20)]. The N-and C-termini of the two proteins are conserved, but the loop region in between contains several insertions/deletions. Most structural alignment methods attempt to align these two proteins by superimposing their entire backbones globally. While this may be useful for some purposes, single global alignments may be skewed as they include the loop region. A more informative view of the evolutionary impact on conformational structure is shown by aligning only the conserved segments. On the PX domains, pFlexAna automatically finds the fragments of tightest similarity, distinct from the loop region, and it presents the clustered alignment result without skew from the inserted amino acids.",

It also clusters the protein fragments that move in tandem. The clustering helps in finding domains comprised of fragments that are discontiguous and out of order along the sequences, e.g. in the case of the maltose-binding protein (Figure 3). Visualization of such information, provided in pFlexAna's output, helps the user to scan for hinge locations, active binding sites, domain movements, etc. For more detailed analysis, the user may use the quantitative information provided in pFlexAna's output, e.g. use the provided transformation matrix for alignment to compute the angle of bending at a particular hinge. pFlexAna's output may also help users interested in predicting conformational motion. They may use the information that pFlexAna provides as a starting point and combine it with other methods such as targeted molecular dynamics (21), where an MD simulation trajectory is 'directed' from an inital conformation towards an alternative target conformation.",

While this is often advantageous as it does not rely on sequence homology, it can potentially cause false positive matching. For example, for proteins with many secondary structure elements (SSEs), it is possible for unrelated long alpha helices or other common motifs comprised of multiple SSEs to be identified as aligned fragment pairs. Comparing glutamine amidotransferase (1MOQ) with a ubiquitin ligase (1ND7) matches two pairs of highly similar a-helices, with RMSD values of 0.22 \u00c5 and 1.64 \u00c5 , respectively. While such aligned pairs are justified based on purely structural similarity, they may not be biologically significant to form a basis for inferring conformational changes. In the future, we intend to filter out such false positives by incorporating secondary structure or sequence information during the matching."
