            "text": "The Hsp90 molecular chaperone, in collaboration with a plethora of co-chaperones, is involved in the assembly and stabilization of key regulatory proteins in the eukaryotic cell (Pearl and Prodromou, 2006). Although the protein clientele of Hsp90 covers a broad range of structural classes, it is nonetheless selective and specific; the biochemical basis for this remains one of the least understood aspects of Hsp90 biology. Recruitment of one important class of Hsp90 clients, protein kinases, requires the adaptor co-chaperone Cdc37, which interacts simultaneously with the kinase and Hsp90, and regulates Hsp90s ATPase cycle in the process (Roe et al, 2004;Pearl, 2005;Caplan et al, 2007). Coupling of the Hsp90 chaperone system to the ubiquitin-regulated signalling and targeted destruction systems is mediated by a dimeric cochaperone adaptor, CHIP (Connell et al, 2001), which binds to Hsp90 through its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes through its U-box domain (Zhang et al, 2005). Other co-chaperones, such as p23 and Aha1, have no apparent role in mediating interactions with clients or other systems, but exert an effect instead as regulators of Hsp90s inherent ATPase cycle (Sullivan et al, 1997;Panaretou et al, 2002;Meyer et al, 2004;Ali et al, 2006).",

            "text": "One of the most recently recognized co-chaperones of Hsp90, Sgt1 (Takahashi et al, 2003), was originally identified as a suppressor of a temperature-sensitive defect in the budding yeast Skp1 protein (Kitagawa et al, 1999). Sgt1p associates with Skp1p as an essential component of the CBF3 kinetochore complex, and is required for the assembly of yeast and human kinetochores (Bansal et al, 2004;Steensgaard et al, 2004). Sgt1p also associates with Skp1p in the context of the SCF (Skp1p-Cdc53p-F-box protein) class of E3 ubiquitin ligases (Kitagawa et al, 1999). Sgt1 is not exclusively associated with Skp1 and interacts independently of Skp1 with adenylate cyclases (Dubacq et al, 2002;Schadick et al, 2002), the CHORD-domain protein RAR1 (Azevedo et al, 2002), and members of a family of proteins including plant disease resistance R-gene products (Bieri et al, 2004;Leister et al, 2005) and animal Nod-like receptors (Mayor et al, 2007;da Silva Correia et al, 2007), that mediate innate immunity to parasites and infection. The ability of Sgt1 to bind to Hsp90 and simultaneously interact with other proteins (Takahashi et al, 2003;Lingelbach and Kaplan, 2004;Catlett and Kaplan, 2006;Mayor et al, 2007;da Silva Correia et al, 2007) implicates it as a client protein adaptor cochaperone in a similar manner to Cdc37, albeit with a more structurally varied clientele.",

            "text": "Sgt1 consists of three identifiable domains: an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain similar to those found in many other Hsp90 and Hsp70 co-chaperones; a central 'CHORD and Sgt1' (CS) domain related to the b-sandwich domain of small heat-shock proteins, a-crystallin and the Hsp90 co-chaperone p23/Sba1; and a C-terminal Sgt-specific (SGS) domain. All three domains mediate protein-protein interactions. The SGS region has been implicated in interaction with leucine-rich repeat domains in the yeast adenylate cyclase Cdc35p (Dubacq et al, 2002), plant R proteins (Bieri et al, 2004;Leister et al, 2005) and the mammalian Nod1 receptor (da Silva Correia et al, 2007). Although initial studies implicated the TPR domain as essential for interaction with both Hsp90 and Skp1 (Bansal et al, 2004), further analysis suggests that the N-terminal TPR domain mediates interactions with Skp1, whereas the central CS domain is responsible for the recruitment of Sgt1 to Hsp90 (Lee et al, 2004;Lingelbach and Kaplan, 2004;Catlett and Kaplan, 2006). Immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays identify the N-terminal half of Hsp90 as sufficient for interaction with Sgt1 (Takahashi et al, 2003).",

The structure of the complex was solved by molecular replacement with the crystal structure of yeast Hsp90-N domain and the NMR structure of human Sgt1-CS domain.

It is most likely that one of the Hsp90-Sgt1 interfaces is the biologically significant interaction, whereas the other is a lattice contact necessary for crystal formation. To identify the biologically significant interface, we analysed the conservation of the residues involved. In the case of Hsp90, which is highly conserved throughout, there was no clear difference between the two points of contact with Sgt1-CS in the crystal. However, Sgt1 showed a marked difference, with the residues involved in one interaction being very much more conserved overall, and with some contributing residues (Tyr157, Lys221 and Glu223) identical in all species ( Figure 1B; Supplementary  Figure 2).",

The core interaction is provided by Tyr157 from AtSgt1a, the hydroxyl group of which hydrogen bonds to the side chains of Glu6 and Lys88 of HvHsp90, whereas its aromatic face packs into a hydrophobic recess on HvHsp90 formed by the side chains of Phe8, Val92 and Lys88, and the main chain of Ser89. Sgt1 Tyr157 is absolutely conserved, as are all the interacting residues in Hsp90, apart from Ser89, which is alanine in non-plant Hsp90s. Phe168 provides a second hydrophobic interaction, packing between the side chains of Thr87, Asp144 and Asp145 on Hsp90. Phe168 is also highly conserved, being phenylalanine in plants and yeast, and methionine in metazoa. These hydrophobic interactions are supported by an extensive network of polar interactions involving Arg153, Glu155, Thr166, Lys170, Lys221 and Glu223 from Sgt1, and Ser89, Asn93, Asp144, Asp145 and Glu146 from Hsp90 ( Figure 1C). All the Sgt1 residues involved are at least very highly conserved, whereas the Hsp90 residues, with the exception of Ser89, are invariant. The Sgt1-CS interaction site on Hsp90 does not involve the mobile lid segment nor does it impinge upon the ATPbinding pocket at the heart of the N domain ( Figure 1D). ",

Mutations of AtSgt1a-Tyr199, at the heart of the nonconserved crystal lattice contact, had no effect on the Y2H interaction with Hsp90, nor did mutation of AtSgt1a-Thr220 on the periphery of the conserved interface. However mutations of Tyr157, Phe168, Lys221 and Glu223, in the conserved interface, all significantly diminished the interaction, confirming its functional significance (Figure 2A).

Previous studies have shown that interaction with Skp1 is mediated by the TPR domain of Sgt1 (Catlett and Kaplan, 2006). As TPR domains are also helical-coil structures, we considered the possibility that Sgt1 might be a cryptic 'F-box' protein and interact with the same site on Skp1. To test this, we co-expressed human Skp1 with Skp2, an F-box protein that mediates the recruitment of p27 kip1 to SCF complexes (Hao et al, 2005), which would therefore compete with Sgt1 if it interacted with the F-box-binding site on Skp1. We found that the Skp1-Skp2 complex or a Skp1-Skp2(F-box) complex was fully able to co-precipitate Sgt1, without competitive displacement of Skp2 with increasing concentrations of Sgt1 ( Figure 3C). This suggests that Sgt1 interacts primarily with the N-terminal lobe of Skp1 and can coexist in Skp1 complexes with Skp2 (and probably other F-box proteins), the binding site of which is in the C-terminal lobe.",

Cullins couple Skp1 to the Rbx1 ring-finger protein that catalyses transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin conjugate, to a lysine on the target protein bound by the F-box protein, or to a ubiquitin molecule already attached to the target. Again, we considered the possibility that the TPR domain of Sgt1 might bind to Skp1 in competition with Cul1. Although GST-Sgt1 was able to co-precipitate Skp1 in isolation, the presence of Cul1 in the reaction decreased the co-precipitation of Skp1 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3D). In the inverse experiment, Cul1 co-precipitated Skp1, but not Sgt1 present in the same reaction ( Figure 3E), confirming that Cul1 and Sgt1 do not interact directly, and that they bind to Skp1 with mutual exclusion. However, we were not able to decrease the amount of Skp1 co-precipitated by Cul1 with increasing amounts of Sgt1. To analyse this further, we directly determined the affinities of Sgt1 and of Cul1, for Skp1, using isothermal titration calorimetry ( Supplementary Figure 3). Although Sgt1 bound in the low micromolar range (K D \u00bc 1.64 mM), Cul1 bound Skp1 B70-fold more tightly, with a dissociation constant of B24 nM, so that Cul1 could not be competed off a Cul1-Skp1 complex by comparable levels of Sgt1. Taken together, these data are fully consistent with Sgt1 and Cul1 binding in mutual exclusion at a common or at least overlapping binding site on the N-terminal half of Skp1.",

Using a GFP-tagged fluorescent virus propagation assay, as described earlier (Azevedo et al, 2006;Boter et al, 2007), we determined the Rx-protein-mediated resistance to infection by potato virus X (PVX), of tobacco leaves (Nicotiana benthamiana) silenced for endogenous Sgt1, and heterologously complemented with wild-type or mutant AtSgt1a (see Materials and methods). Alanine mutations of Tyr199 on the three-stranded face of AtSgt1a-CS domain or of Thr220 on the four-stranded face, but not involved in direct contact with Hsp90, had no effect on the ability of the mutant protein to confer resistance to infection. Alanine mutations of Glu223 or Thr166, which are part of the Hsp90-interacting surface, also had little effect on resistance. However, alanine mutation of Tyr157, at the heart of the interface with Hsp90, or a charge reversal mutation of Lys221 close by, caused a substantial loss of resistance, comparable to an Sgt1a null ( Figure 4A). The ability of a single missense mutation in Sgt1 that specifically disrupts its interaction with Hsp90 in vitro, to disrupt R-gene-mediated viral resistance in vivo, provides definitive evidence for the direct dependence of this class of innate immunity system on the Hsp90 chaperone system, with Sgt1 acting as a molecular scaffold coupling the two.",

To determine whether essential Sgt1 functions in yeast are also dependent on its interaction with Hsp90, we engineered similar interface-disrupting point mutations, singly and in combination, into yeast Sgt1 and determined their ability to confer viability in the absence of a wild-type Sgt1 allele (see Materials and methods). Unlike the plant system, single-point mutations in either of the main hydrophobic Sgt1 interface residues (Tyr190, Phe201Tyr157, Phe168 in plants) had little effect ( Figure 4B). However, double mutants abrogated viability. This is consistent with the observation of multiple missense mutations in previously identified ts SGT1 alleles (Kitagawa et al, 1999). Furthermore, although viable under normal conditions, yeast harbouring Sgt1 single-point mutants were significantly more sensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, than wild type ( Figure 4C). Taken together, these data confirm the dependence of essential Sgt1 functions in yeast on its ability to form a stable complex with Hsp90.",

Although the CS domain of Sgt1 and the globular core domain of p23/Sba1 have similar three-dimensional structures, they bind to different regions of the Hsp90 surface, using different parts of their own structures. Sgt1 utilizes residues on the surface of the fourstranded b-sheet, whereas a C-terminal strand, not present in Sgt1-CS, provides the majority of p23/Sba1a interaction with Hsp90-N ( Figure 6A). Most significant mechanistically are the different sites of interaction of p23/Sba1 and Sgt1-CS on Hsp90-N, and their effect on the conformational changes associated with Hsp90s ATPase cycle. p23/Sba1 interacts with residues on the lid segment of Hsp90 that are only available in the ATP-bound conformation of the chaperone (Ali et al, 2006), explaining the strongly ATP-dependent binding of p23/Sba1 (Sullivan et al, 1997;Siligardi et al, 2004). Sgt1-CS binds to Hsp90-N away from the lid and ATP-binding pocket, so that its preferential binding in the absence of ATP (Lee et al, 2004;Catlett and Kaplan, 2006) is difficult to explain at first sight. However, part of the interaction is provided by Glu6 and Phe8 from the N-terminal strand of Hsp90, which undergoes a large movement during the ATPase cycle, swapping from its own N domain in the open ATP-free state (Prodromou et al, 1997) to bind to the other N domain in the closed ATP-bound conformation (Ali et al, 2006), recapitulating its previous interactions. Although Sgt1-CS could interact with the Nterminal strand in the ATP-free or ATP-bound states, it would certainly be displaced during the ATP-driven conformational change, so that in the presence of ATP the equilibrium concentration of Hsp90-Sgt1 complexes would be lower than in its absence. Furthermore, when the Hsp90-N-Sgt1-CS complex is used to model binding of Sgt1-CS domains to both Hsp90-N domains in the closed ATP-bound Figure 5 Co-binding of TPR domain E3 ligase CHIP and Sgt1. His 6tagged human Hsp90b efficiently co-precipitates Sgt1 and CHIP, confirming that the TPR domain of Sgt1 does not interact with the C-terminal MEEVD sequence of Hsp90, which provides the binding site for CHIP, and other TPR domain co-chaperones. Figure 4 Functional dependence of Sgt1 on Hsp90 interaction in vivo. (A) Functional assay of SGT1a mutants in Rx-mediated resistance against potato virus X (PVX). Rx-containing N. benthamiana plants silenced for NbSGT1 were co-infiltrated with Agrobacterium expressing wild-type AtSGT1a (lower left, positive control), or AtSGT1a mutants as indicated (right half of the leaf) or GUS (upper left, negative control) together with PVX-GFP. Virus accumulation was monitored by GFP fluorescence under UV illumination 5 days after inoculation. Mutations in residues not involved in the core interface (Tyr199 and Thr220) with Hsp90 had little effect on the ability of AtSgt1a to facilitate viral resistance. Mutations of the hydrophobic Hsp90 interface residues Tyr157 or Phe168, and charge-reversal mutations in polar interface residues Lys221 or Glu223, severely impaired the biological function of Sgt1a. (B) Single-point mutations in Hsp90-interacting residues did not significantly impair essential Sgt1 functions in yeast (left), but double mutants abolished viability (right). (C) Single-point mutations in Hsp90-interacting residues in yeast Sgt1 sensitize yeast to killing by the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA). structure of the dimer (Figure 6B), there is a steric clash between the two Sgt1-CS domains. This may be exacerbated by the presence of the N-terminal TPR and C-terminal SGS domains, the disposition of which within the overall Hsp90-Sgt1 complex is not currently known.",

Unlike Cdc37 however, it does not appear to regulate the ATPase activity of Hsp90 (Catlett and Kaplan, 2006). In plant innate immunity systems, Sgt1 is essential not only for the activity of R-proteins but also for their stable accumulation (Bieri et al, 2004;Azevedo et al, 2006;Boter et al, 2007). However, the related mammalian Nod-like receptors lose activity, but not stability, when Sgt1 is knocked down (da Silva Correia et al, 2007). They are nonetheless depleted by pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90, suggesting that this biologically widespread family of proteins are bone fide Hsp90 clients.",

A variety of different SCF subassemblies can be expressed in a functional state in bacteria, which argues against a stringent client dependence on Hsp90, and no depletion of SCF components on Hsp90 inhibition has been reported. Sgt1 physically couples Hsp90 and Skp1 (Catlett and Kaplan, 2006) and we have extended that observation to show that Sgt1 binds Skp1 in the presence of an F-box protein. Thus, Sgt1 links Hsp90 to the target-specific 'arm' of an SCF complex. The ability of Sgt1 to bind Skp1 alongside an F-box protein explains the association of Hsp90-Sgt1 with the yeast CBF3 kinetochore complex (Kitagawa et al, 1999;Stemmann et al, 2002;Bansal et al, 2004;Lingelbach and Kaplan, 2004;Rodrigo-Brenni et al, 2004;Steensgaard et al, 2004), as the Ctf13 component of CBF3 is an F-box protein, that is itself the target of ubiquitin-dependent degradation (Kaplan et al, 1997).",

At first sight, this appears to be in contradiction to a reported co-precipitation from yeast lysates of the cullin Cdc53p, as well as Skp1p, by Sgt1p (Kitagawa et al, 1999). However, when SCF components were expressed in insect cells in the same study, the amount of Sgt1p co-precipitated by the F-box protein Cdc4p was decreased when Cdc53p was also present, consistent with our clear observation using purified human proteins that Cul1 and Sgt1 compete for Skp1 binding.",

            "text": "Association of the cullin arm with the specific arm of SCF complexes, through binding to Skp1, is regulated by a complex cycle of reversible modification involving covalent attachment of NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, to Cul1. Neddylated Cul1 in complex with Rbx1 associates with Skp1 and its attendant F-box protein and is fully competent to recruit E2 ubiquitin conjugates and ubiquitinate the substrate protein bound to the F-box protein (Wu et al, 2006). This active SCF complex is inactivated when NEDD8 is removed by the COP9 signalosome complex (Lyapina et al, 2001). De-neddylated Cul1 is then bound by Cand1 with concomitant displacement of the Skp1-F-Box subcomplex Figure 6 CS domain interactions. (A) Comparison of the binding surfaces used by the structurally homologous CS domains of the Hsp90 co-chaperones Sgt1 (left) and p23/Sba1 (right). Sgt1-CS uses residues on the face of its four-stranded b-sheet, whereas p23/Sba1 interacts with Hsp90-N through a C-terminal extension not present in Sgt1. The interaction site on Hsp90-N (bottom, magenta) is also completely different, with Sgt1-CS binding the side of the domain, whereas p23/Sba1 binds directly to the lid segment in its closed ATP-bound conformation. (B) Hypothetical model of Sgt1-CS binding to Hsp90 in the closed ATP-bound conformation, made by superimposing the Hsp90-N domain from the present structure on to the crystal structure of the full-length Hsp90-AMPPNP-p23/Sba1 structure (PDB code 2CG9). Consistent with the preference of Sgt1 for binding to the open ADP-bound state of Hsp90, the docked Sgt1-CS domains clash sterically, and this is likely to be exacerbated in the context of the full-length protein by the TPR and SGS domains, which extend from the N-and C terminus, respectively. and blockade of the NEDD8 attachment site on the cullin (Goldenberg et al, 2004). Regeneration of an active SCF complex thus requires displacement of Cand1, neddylation and association with a new Skp1-F-Box substrate complex (Wu et al, 2006). The ability of Sgt1 to couple Hsp90 to the specific arm of SCF complexes, along with its competitive displacement by the cullin arm, suggests a clear chaperone role for Hsp90-Sgt1 in binding and stabilizing a Skp1-F-Box substrate complex in the absence of Cul1-Rbx1. This is fully consistent with the observation of the B70-fold higher affinity we observe with Cul1, as compared with Sgt1, for binding to Skp1, which would ensure efficient displacement of Hsp90-Sgt1 from a new Skp1-F-Box substrate complex by Cul1, once freed of its inhibitory association with Cand1. The ATPase cycle of Hsp90 could have a function in facilitating the release of Cul1 from Cand1, and allowing its re-association with Skp1 to regenerate an active SCF complex ( Figure 7A and B); however, further work will be required to test this possibility. A role for Hsp90-Sgt1 in facilitating the assembly of SCF complexes is fully consistent with observations that defective SGT1 alleles in yeast impair SCF-dependent turnover of Sic1p in vivo, and extracts from SGT1impaired strains are defective in cyclin ubiquitination in vitro (Kitagawa et al, 1999).",

            "text": "Hsp90 might also have a function in facilitating or regulating access of the substrate protein to the SCF system. A number of proteins known to be Hsp90 clients are degraded through SCF complexes, most significant of which is probably the cell cycle regulatory tyrosine kinase Wee1 (Aligue et al, 1994;Watanabe et al, 2004). However, the interplay between these two Wee1-interacting pathways has not so far been characterized, although both are required for proper mitotic entry. It has long been known that inhibition of Hsp90 promotes ubiquitin-dependent degradation of its client proteins (Mimnaugh et al, 1996), but the E3 systems responsible, particularly for protein kinases, have not been unambiguously identified. The TPR domain U-box protein CHIP is an E3 ubiquitin ligase able to associate with Hsp90 or Hsp70 through the C-terminal EEVD motif (Cyr et al, 2002;Zhang et al, 2005), and is a clear candidate for that role, although there are only a few clear demonstrations of CHIP's involvement in the degradation of major Hsp90 clients such as protein kinases (Xu et al, 2002;Zhang et al, 2007). The ability of CHIP to bind to an Hsp90-Sgt1 complex raises the possibility that it could have a function in ubiquitination of Skp1-F-Box-bound substrate proteins, possibly as a backup under stress conditions, or in some circumstances in direct collaboration with the SCF system (Nelson et al, 2006).",

Initial multiple crystals were grown by vapour diffusion at 41C against 26% w/v PEG4000, 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5) and 200 mM magnesium sulphate. Subsequent streak seeding into solutions of 16% w/v PEG4000, 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5) and 200 mM magnesium sulphate produced single thin plates. Crystals were harvested into reservoir solution with addition of glycerol (20% v/v) before flash cooling to 100 K. X-ray data were collected on beamline ID23 at the ESRF, Grenoble, from single crystals, and processed by using MOSFLM (Leslie, 1995) and the CCP4 package (CCP4, 1994). Crystals had space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , with three copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit. The thin plate crystals have a high solvent content (59% v/v) and only gave useful diffraction to 3.3 \u00c5 . The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (McCoy, 2007) using ADP-bound yeast Hsp90-N (PDB code: 1AMW) and the solution structure of human Sgt1-CS domain (PDB code: 1RL1) as search models, built using COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004), and refined with CNS in PHENIX (Adams et al, 2002), using NCS restraints.
