            "text": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and promotes degradation of the LDLR. Inhibition of PCSK9 either by reducing its expression or by blocking its activity results in the upregulation of the LDLR and subsequently lowers the plasma concentration of LDL-cholesterol. As a modality to inhibit PCSK9 action, we searched the chemical library for small molecules that block the binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR. Materials and Methods: We selected 100 chemicals that bind to PCSK9 where the EGF-AB fragment of the LDLR binds via in silico screening of the ChemBridge chemical library, using the computational GOLD algorithm analysis. Effects of chemicals were evaluated using the PCSK9-LDLR binding assay, immunoblot analysis, and the LDL-cholesterol uptake assay in vitro, as well as the fast performance liquid chromatography assay for plasma lipoproteins in vivo. Results: A set of chemicals were found that decreased the binding of PCSK9 to the EGF-AB fragment of the LDLR in a dose-dependent manner. They also increased the amount of the LDLR significantly and subsequently increased the uptake of fluorescencelabeled LDL in HepG2 cells. Additionally, one particular molecule lowered the plasma concentration of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol significantly in wild-type mice, while such an effect was not observed in Pcsk9 knockout mice. Conclusion: Our findings strongly suggest that in silico screening of small molecules that inhibit the protein-protein interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR is a potential modality for developing hypercholesterolemia therapeutics.",

However, the most preferred approach in terms of pharmaceutical development would be small molecules targeting PCSK by reducing either the amount or the activity of PCSK9. Structure-based screening of small molecules targeting the protein-protein interaction is a powerful tool in drug development when the structure of the target protein is well established. 12 The structure of PCSK9 and its binding motif to the EGF-A domain of the LDLR is well-characterized by several researchers.

As shown in Table 1, the order of docking scores correlated closely with the inhibition of PCSK9-LDLR binding (relative inhibition; \u03c1=0.444, p<0.01). However, being different from what we expected, the order of docking scores did not correlate significantly with changes in the Dil-LDL uptake and the amount of LDLR. A weak relationship of the order of docking scores with the increase in the amount of PCSK9 was observed (\u03c1=0.192); however, this correlation was insignificant statistically. Most notably, the inhibition of PCSK9-LDLR binding by chemicals correlated with all parameters significantly: fluorescence-labeled LDL-cholesterol uptake (Dil-LDL uptake, \u03c1=0.400, p<0.01), the amount of LDLR (\u03c1=0.334, p<0.01), and the amount of PCSK9 (\u03c1=0.409, p<0.01). The Dil-LDL uptake correlated with the amount of LDLR (\u03c1=0.516, p<0.01) most strongly, and there was also a correlation with the amount of PCSK9 (\u03c1=0.478, p<0.01). The amount of PCSK9 showed positive correlation with the relative inhibition of PCSK9-LDLR binding (\u03c1=0.409, p<0.01), the Dil-LDL uptake (\u03c1=0.313, p<0.01), and the amount of LDLR (\u03c1=0.478, p<0.01). These results suggest that the docking score alone is insufficient for functional validation of candidate chemicals; however, it has strong potential for the prediction of blocking ligands for PCSK9 when one of the in vitro experiments, particularly the PCSK9-LDLR binding assay, is carried out concurrently.",

The structures of these chemicals are depicted in Fig. 1. The concentrations of chemicals applied were determined experimentally and set as low as possible. All three chemicals increased the expression of the LDLR and PCSK9 in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2A). The decrease in the LDLR and PCSK9 by the compound #7632817 at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/mL appeared to be due to cytotoxicity ( Fig. 2A, lane 12). The uptake of Dil-LDL was increased accordingly with the increase in LDLR and PCSK9 expression ( Fig. 2B). When the intensity of the fluorescence in cells was quantitated using flow cytometry analysis, CB_36 at 5 \u03bcg/mL increased the uptake of Dil-LDL by a factor of 1.69 compared to the vehicle (DMSO) (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, #7632817, the compound that had the most similar three-dimensional structure (94%) and was predicted not by the GOLD algorithm but by ChemBridge, increased the Dil-LDL uptake most strongly by a factor of 2.13. Chemical #7338220 (75% similarity) was relatively less effective in increasing the LDL uptake (by a factor of 1.37 at a concentration of 30 \u03bcg/mL). These results suggest that CB_36 and its analogs function to increase the uptake of LDL cholesterol in HepG2 cells despite the simultaneous increase in the amount of PCSK9.",

The chemical #7338220 was not evaluated due to its weak effect on the uptake of Dil-LDL in HepG2 cells. C57BL/6J male mice (six per group) and Pcsk9 -/mice (five per group) were injected with CB_36 via tail vein at a concentration of 1 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days, and metabolic parameters were evaluated ( Table 2). CB_36 significantly lowered the concentration of TC in wildtype mice by 18% compared to that in vehicle-treated mice (p <0.05), while the other phenotypic parameters in wild-type mice remained unchanged. More importantly, CB_36 had no effect on any parameters in Pcsk9 -/mice, suggesting that the action of CB_36 may involve a PCSK9-dependent pathway. The decrease in the plasma concentration of TC by CB_36 in wild-type mice was re-defined as a consequence of the decrease in LDL fractions in the lipoprotein profile determined by FPLC in wild-type mice ( Fig. 3A; fraction numbers 15-22), while no change was observed in Pcsk9 -/mice. In wild-type mice, CB_36 also lowered the cholesterol level in fractions containing high-density lipoprotein ( Fig. 3A; fraction numbers 23-30), of which the ApoE was also the ligand to the LDLR. 22 However, in contrast to the results from HepG2 cells, CB_36 showed no differences in the amounts of LDLR and PCSK9 in the livers of wild-type or Pcsk9 -/mice (Fig. 3B). These results strongly suggest that CB_36 has the effect of lowering the TC level in plasma, particularly by lowering the LDL fraction of lipoproteins in a PCSK9-dependent manner, although amounts of LDLR and PCSK9 in the liver remained unchanged.",

As almost all patents of statin drugs expired recently, numerous pharmaceutical industries are devoting effort to developing new drugs that can be used in patients with hypercholesterolemia in combination with statins. The other advantage of PCSK9 inhibition is possible augmentation of the cholesterol-lowering effect by statins, which induce simultaneously the expression of PCSK9 and LDLR. Among several strategies applied for the development of PCSK9 inhibitors, it is evident that the most up-to-date approach is the use of monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9. However, the cost-effectiveness and the injection route of antibody therapeutics into patients with hypercholesterolemia alone would be the major obstacles to overcome. In this respect, recent advances in public computational algorithms and open chemical databases have en- abled standard laboratories to carry out a large-scale screening of small molecular inhibitors of protein-protein interaction for drug development at ease. In silico virtual screening has been used to discover many small-molecule inhibitory ligands for enzymes such as BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, 23 P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase, 24 and inhibitors of proteinprotein interaction such as interaction between insulin-like growth factor-1 and the N-terminus of the IGF-binding protein-5 25 or the C-terminal tail of myosin A and the myosin-tail interacting protein in P. falciparum. 26 However, without any evident reason, there have been no known reports involving searches for small chemical molecules that inhibit PCSK9-LDLR interaction.",

Detailed kinetic studies on the mechanism of inhibition by CB_36 were not carried out, as the required research resources were unavailable and the purpose of this study was limited to the overall evaluation of the application of in silico screening. Direct evidence by mapping the ligand-binding site by site-directed mutagenesis of PCSK9 or by performing NMR studies, for example, needs to be obtained in future studies. CB_36 and its two analogs, which were proposed by Chem-Bridge's web-based information, inhibited the PCSK9-LDLR interaction and increased the amount of LDLR, PCSK9, and the uptake of LDL-cholesterol in vitro. Most importantly, CB_36 lowered the total plasma cholesterol level in wild-type mice, particularly LDL cholesterol. Several additional chemicals other than CB_36 showed similar results both in vitro and in vivo (data not shown). However, the mechanism for this cholesterol-lowering effect by CB_36 could not be elucidated in mice, as the amounts of LDLR and PCSK9 remained unchanged by CB_36. It is possible to assume that additional mechanisms exert a feedback reconstitution of the LDLR after an increase in the metabolism of LDL cholesterol in the liver as in lovastatin-treated wild-type mice, which showed a decrease in plasma LDL cholesterol despite a slight decrease in LDLR expression. 22 Additional concrete evidence for the usefulness of these chemicals remains to be provided, for example, whether these chemicals bind to PCSK9 directly, whether their effects are mediated by PCSK9 in a specific-manner, whether they are safe enough for practical application in patients, and why the decrease in blood cholesterol level by chemicals is minimal compared to that caused by statin drugs. However, this study provides strong support for in silico screening of chemical libraries for the development of new cholesterol-lowering agents that inhibit the interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR.  3.
