Characterization of DREB genes and development of functional markers for effective alleles is important for marker-assisted selection in foxtail millet. Here the characterization of a cDNA (SiDREB2) encoding a putative dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2 from foxtail millet and the development of an allelespecific marker (ASM) for dehydration tolerance is reported. A cDNA clone (GenBank accession no. GT090998) coding for a putative DREB2 protein was isolated as a differentially expressed gene from a 6 h dehydration stress SSH library. A 5' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was carried out to obtain the full-length cDNA, and sequence analysis showed that SiDREB2 encoded a polypeptide of 234 amino acids with a predicted mol. wt of 25.72 kDa and a theoretical pI of 5.14. A theoretical model of the tertiary structure shows that it has a highly conserved GCC-box-binding N-terminal domain, and an acidic C-terminus that acts as an activation domain for transcription. Based on its similarity to AP2 domains, SiDREB2 was classified into the A-2 subgroup of the DREB subfamily. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed significant up-regulation of SiDREB2 by dehydration (polyethylene glycol) and salinity (NaCl), while its expression was less affected by other stresses. A synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with dehydration tolerance was detected at the 558th base pair (an A/G transition) in the SiDREB2 gene in a core set of 45 foxtail millet accessions used. Based on the identified SNP, three primers were designed to develop an ASM for dehydration tolerance. The ASM produced a 261 bp fragment in all the tolerant accessions and produced no amplification in the sensitive accessions. The use of this ASM might be faster, cheaper, and more reproducible than other SNP genotyping methods, and thus will enable marker-aided breeding of foxtail millet for dehydration tolerance.",

            "text": "Foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.), an elite drought-tolerant crop, is an important food and fodder grain crop in arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. Its genome is being sequenced by the US Department of Energy Joint Genomic Institute and BGI (formerly the Beijing Genomics Institute), China. Foxtail millet together with proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) ranks second in the total world production of millets (FAO STAT data 2005; http://faostat. fao.org/). It is a diploid (2n\u00bc2x\u00bc18), self-pollinating, C 4 panicoid crop, with a small genome of ;490 Mb having a low repetitive DNA content (30%) and a highly conserved genome structure relative to the ancestral grass lineage, making it a suitable model species for genetic and molecular studies (Devos et al., 1998;Jayaraman et al., 2008). Further, it is a close relative of several important biofuel crops such as, switchgrass, napiergrass, and pearl millet, and hence has been suggested to represent an appropriate model for this class of crop species (Doust et al., 2009). Water use efficiency of foxtail millet has been shown to be higher than that of maize, wheat, and sorghum (Gu et al., 1987). The adaptation of foxtail millet to low water conditions has been ascribed to its relatively small leaf area, the cell arrangement in its epidermis, its thick cell walls, and its ability to form a dense root system (Li, 1987). However, the molecular mechanism of its drought adaptation is still not clear. To gain a better understanding of the molecular responses of this crop to dehydration stress, two SSH forward libraries were constructed (Lata et al., 2010). A differentially expressed expressed sequence tag (EST) from a 6 h dehydration stress library was found to encode a dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2 (DREB2).",

            "text": "The DREBs are important transcription factors that induce a set of abiotic stress-related genes and impart stress tolerance to plants. They could broadly be grouped as DREB1 and DREB2, involved in two separate signal transduction pathways under low temperature and dehydration, respectively (Agarwal et al., 2006). They belong to the ERF (ethylene-responsive element-binding factor) family, a subfamily of AP2/EREBP (APETALA2/ethyleneresponsive element-binding protein) plant-specific transcription factors (Riechmann et al., 2000). These proteins share a conserved DNA-binding domain of ;58-59 amino acids that bind to two cis-elements, namely a GCC box and a CRT/DRE (C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element) motif playing an important role in regulating gene expression in response to dehydration, high salinity, and cold in plants (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 2005;Agarwal et al., 2006). The 14th and 19th amino acids of the AP2/ ERF domain are highly distinctive as they distinguish the DREB (valine and glutamic acid, respectively) from the ERF (alanine and aspartic acid, respectively) gene classes (Sakuma et al., 2002). Abscisic acid (ABA)-independent stress-responsive gene expression is generally regulated by DREBs that bind to DRE cis-elements (5#-TACCGACAT-3#). The first cDNA clone for a DREB, CBF1 (CRTbinding factor 1) was isolated in a yeast one-hybrid screening (Stockinger et al., 1997). Since then several DREBs have been identified from Arabidopsis, rice, maize, and other plants that specifically interact with the DRE sequence (Liu et al., 1998;Dubouzet et al., 2003;Chen et al., 2007;Qin et al., 2007). Overexpression of Arabidopsis DREB2A results in significant drought stress tolerance, water stress, and heat stress tolerance, but only slight freezing tolerance in transgenic plants (Sakuma et al., 2006a, b). GmDREB2 also conferred drought and highsalinity tolerance to transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco plants (Chen et al., 2007). However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies on AP2/EREBP transcription factors in foxtail millet have been reported.",

SNPs can serve as a powerful tool for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and map-based cloning since they are considered as highly stable markers and often contribute directly to a phenotype (Andersen and Luebberstedt, 2003;Kim et al., 2005).

Secondary structure prediction of the SiDREB2 protein was performed using the program PSIPRED (Jones, 1999). The ab intio structure prediction of the protein was done with the help of I-TASSER (Zhang, 2008). Automated homology model building of the DNA-binding domain was performed using the protein structure modelling program MOD-ELLER which models protein tertiary structure by satisfaction of spatial restraints. The input for MODELLER consisted of the aligned sequences of 1gcc and the SiDREB2, a steering file that gives all the necessary commands to the MODELLER to produce a homology model of the target on the basis of its alignment with the template. Energy minimization was performed by the steepest descent followed by the conjugate gradient method using a 20 \u00c5 non-bonded cut-off and a constant dielectric of 1.0. Evaluation of the predicted model involved analyses of the geometry and the stereochemistry of the model. The reliability of the model structure was tested using the ENERGY commands of MODELLER (Sali and Blundell, 1993).

The total amount of TBAreacting substances reflects the level of LP resulting from oxidative stress (Guo et al., 2006). The increased accumulation of lipid peroxides upon oxidative stress indicates enhanced production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are responsible for stress-induced peroxidation of membrane lipids and are often used as an indicator of increased oxidative damage (Smirnoff, 1995). The level of MDA increased significantly in the sensitive accessions during 24 h of dehydration stress with respect to the control (sensitive, <100% increase; highly sensitive, >100% increase; P <0.05), whereas the level of LP in the tolerant accessions declined significantly in comparison with the control (highly tolerant, >30% decline; tolerant, <30% decline; P <0.05) (Table 1). Sreenivasulu et al. (1999) also observed an increase in MDA content in the sensitive foxtail millet cv. Lepakshi as compared with the tolerant cv. Prasad in response to 150 mM salinity stress in 5-day-old seedlings. LP was demonstrated as a function of membrane integrity in chickpea plants exposed to dehydration stress for 7 d and, together with electrolytic leakage, has been shown to be a direct indicator of dehydration stress tolerance (Bhushan et al., 2007). Further, enhanced H 2 O 2 scavenging ability and low levels of LP provide tolerance to various crop plants including pigeonpea, sesame, and alfalfa (Shigeoka et al., 2002;Fazeli et al., 2007;Kumutha et al., 2009).",

Although having the same water potential, genotypes may vary in their RWC due to the respective difference in osmotic adjustment. Leaf RWC was determined in 45 foxtail millet accessions exposed to 24 h of PEG-induced dehydration stress. Stress treatments significantly decreased the RWC in all accessions ( Table 1). The tolerant accessions showed the capacity to maintain a relatively high RWC in comparison with the sensitive accessions during stress (0-60% decline in highly tolerant, 61-66% decline in tolerant; 70-75% decline in sensitive, >75% decline in highly sensitive; P <0.05). The above observations are in accordance with previous reports on several other water-stressed crop plants such as Cenchrus sp., chickpea, groundnut, wheat, sorghum, and maize (Nagy et al., 1995;El Hafid et al., 1998;Madhusudan et al., 2006;Bhushan et al., 2007;Chandra and Dubey, 2010).",

GT090998) coding for putative DREB2 was isolated from a 6 h SSH library as a differentially expressed sequence in response to PEGinduced dehydration stress. The original 529 bp truncated cDNA clone was complete at its 3' end and aligned to a maize gene encoding a DREB2. Hence, a 5' RACE was carried out to obtain the 5' end of the cDNA. Finally the open reading frame (ORF) of this gene was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned. This gene, designated as SiDREB2 (GenBank ID HQ132744), had a full-length cDNA of 1119 bp, with an ORF of 705 nucleotides. The deduced protein contained 234 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 25.72 kDa and a theoretical pI of 5.14. The SiDREB2 protein has a highly conserved AP2/ERF DNAbinding domain of 58 amino acids. It also had two conserved functional amino acids (valine and glutamic acid) at the 14th and 19th residues, respectively, in the DNAbinding domain, thought to be crucial sites for the binding of DREBs and DRE core sequences (Liu et al., 1998). An alkaline N-terminal amino acid region (RRK), which might act as a nuclear localization signal, and a conserved Ser/ Thr-rich region adjacent to the AP2/ERF DNA-binding domain were also present (Fig. 1A). The protein contained an acidic C-terminal region which might be functional in trans-activation activity (Stockinger et al., 1997). Most of the positively charged residues are found to be conserved in the N-terminal domain of SiDREB2.",

To create a 3D structure of SiDREB2, a BLAST search was performed in protein databases for proteins with similar sequence and known 3D structure, but no significant homologous template was found to model the complete sequence. Thus, ab initio modelling of SiDREB2 was done with the help of the I-TASSER server. In brief, this is a hierarchical protein structure modelling approach based on the secondary structure-enhanced Profile-Profile threading alignment (Zhang, 2008). The model structure was validated with PROSA (z-score of -5.58) which was in the range of native conformations of other experimentally determined protein structures of the same size (Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007).

The sequence alignment between the target and the template is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online. In addition, the secondary structure of this domain as predicted by several secondary structure prediction servers (PHDsec: www.predictprotein.org/; PSIPRED: http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac. uk/psipred/) is quite similar to the secondary structure of 1gcc ( Supplementary Fig. S1, and Fig. 1E). This finding supports the results obtained from several fold recognition servers (FUGUE: www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/;fugue/; 3DPSSM: www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/), suggesting that SiDREB2 has the fold of the DNA-binding domain of the DREB superfamily. Based on the above information, the 'A' subunit of 1gcc was used as a template to predict the 3D structure of SiDREB2 by applying the comparative modelling strategy as described in the Materials and methods. The overall rmsd (root mean square deviation) between the template and the target structure is 0.2 \u00c5 . The calculated angle between the b-sheet and a-helices is ;172\u00b0. The amino acid residues Arg6, Arg8, Trp10, Glu16, Arg18, Arg25, and Trp27 that are known to make direct contact with the DNA double helix for deciphering the DNA-binding activity are also fully conserved.",

These results indicate that this gene has a low copy number in the foxtail millet genome; however, the minor bands indicate the presence of a low number of homologous copies of SiDREB2. Such an observation has also been confirmed in wheat for Wdreb2 (Egawa et al., 2006).

The up-regulation of this gene (up to 12-fold) in tolerant accessions suggests that it might impart drought tolerance capacity to the tolerant accessions in comparison with the sensitive ones.

The strong responsiveness of the SiDREB2 gene to dehydration and salinity implies that its role in the transduction of abiotic stress signals is very similar to those of Arabidopsis and rice, and occurs more or less through an ABA-independent pathway (Liu et al., 1998;Sakuma et al., 2002;Dubouzet et al., 2003).",

All the accessions were subjected to 24 h of dehydration stress as compared with the respective controls. The amplified genomic DNA sequence (SiDREB2 FL_F and SiDREB2 FL_R primers) analysis of SiDREB2 from four highly dehydration-tolerant (GS-464, IC-403579, Prasad, and IC-403476) and four highly sensitive (IC-403521, IC-404178, Lepakshi, and IC-480117) accessions revealed the synonymous SNP at base pair 558 (A/G transition) (Fig. 5A). This A/G transition was further validated by sequencing of the SiDREB2 gene with the same primers in an additional 11 and 26 dehydration-tolerant and sensitive accessions, respectively (Table 1). Based on this sequence analysis, locus-specific primers (LSPs) and allele-specific primers (ASPs) were developed (Table 2). PCR products of LSPs (SiDREB2 FL_F and SNP.TS_R) and ASPs (DREB.AP2_F and SNP.Tol_R) in all 45 accessions were generated at the same time and checked by resolving them on a 1% agarose gel independently. Later, the PCR products were mixed and resolved on an agarose gel for both locus-specific markers and ASMs (Fig. 5B). LSPs gave a 558 bp fragment in all the accessions, while ASPs gave a 261 bp fragment in 15 dehydration-tolerant accessions only. Therefore, the dehydration-tolerant accessions were proven to be linked to the 'A'-specific allele (Table1).",

Introduction of additional mismatch bases has improved the specificity of this technique (Drenkard et al., 2000). Its application is especially important for an accurate discrimination of different alleles in MAS. In the present study, only one pair of ASPs was used to amplify the specific products from the dehydration-tolerant and sensitive accessions. Therefore, the ASM can be effectively used to type SNPs as well as to avoid unambiguous false scoring. The functional differences in trait performance mainly caused by SNPs has also been reported in previous studies on several cloned genes (Peng et al., 1999;Takahashi et al., 2001;Liu et al., 2002;Jin et al., 2003;Toshiyuki et al., 2003;Kim et al., 2005;Garc\u00e9s-Claver et al., 2007;Fan et al., 2009). Molecular markerassisted breeding technology is a rapid and accurate method for any candidate gene, providing a very effective tool for backcross breeding (Collard and Mackill, 2008). MAS efficiency is influenced by several complex factors such as recombination between the marker and the candidate gene, a low level of polymorphism between the parents with contrasting traits, and lower resolution of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) due to environmental interactions. In the present study, the ASM is part of the candidate gene, thus eliminating the main disadvantage of MAS. However, the ASM developed in this study is a dominant marker, and therefore it cannot distinguish the heterozygotes. The marker has high reliability and efficiency, and the desired PCR product can be identified easily on a simple agarose gel. With the help of this marker, dehydration-tolerant accessions can be selected at a variety of life stages. This is particularly true when the target is the dehydration-tolerant allele in backcross breeding and thus the foxtail millet breeding process can be accelerated. Further, the ASM identified would facilitate allele mining of foxtail millet germplasm resources, thereby leading to identification and utilization of newer alleles in crop improvement.",

            "text": "In summary, the findings from the current study suggest that SiDREB2 is a novel DREB2-like transcription factor of the AP2/EREBP family since the sequence transition of A-G in this gene was associated with the differences in the dehydration tolerance levels among the foxtail millet accessions. It mediates various stress responses and developmental processes in foxtail millet. The structure determination of the SiDREB2 gene and the DNA-binding domain may provide the framework for understanding the functions of DREBs at the molecular level. The higher expression level of SiDREB2 in tolerant accessions in comparison with sensitive accessions could probably be due to some deficiency of a stressresponsive regulatory cis-element in the promoter regions of the sensitive accessions or due to post-transcriptional modification of its gene. However, this remains to be demonstrated before any conclusions can be reached. The ASM developed in this study requires validation before it can be implemented routinely to assist selection for dehydration tolerance in foxtail millet breeding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of molecular cloning, characterization of a DREB2-like gene SiDREB2 in foxtail millet, and development of an ASM for dehydration tolerance. We are also currently exploring the biological functions of SiDREB2 in stress and developmental responses of foxtail millet using overexpression, gene silencing, and promoter analysis. Fig. 4. Expression patterns of SiDREB2 in various intact tissues of foxtail millet. Total RNAs were extracted from whole seedling, leaves, roots, young spikelets, and mature spikelets. The results are relative to expression in whole seedlings. Actin was used as endogenous control. Bars indicate the standard error (6SE) calculated from three independent experiments. Table 2.

Asterisks denote similar sequences, the box represents the SNP, solid arrows represent allele-specific primers (DREB.AP2_F and SNP.Tol_R), and the dashed arrow represents the locusspecific reverse primer (SNP.TS_R). The locus-specific forward primer is shown as a dashed arrow in Fig. 1A. (B) Agarose gel image of the allele-specific and locus-specific SNP-derived allele-specific marker (ASM) associated with dehydration tolerance. The ASM can distinguish the A allele (tolerant), which generates a 261 bp fragment, from the G allele (sensitive), which generates no PCR fragment. The 558 bp fragment is common to both alleles and it is used as a positive control. The order of samples is the same as in Table 1. ",
