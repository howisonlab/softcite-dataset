            "text": "The coagulase-negative bacterium Staphylococcus condimenti and closely related species are commonly isolated from or found in starter cultures of fermented sausage as well as fish and soy sauces, and have traditionally been considered nonpathogenic. Recently, however, a case of catheter-related bacteraemia caused by S. condimenti was reported. In the present study we identified and characterized a strain of S. condimenti isolated from a patient with a severe soft tissue infection, comparing it to S. condimenti and S. carnosus type strains in order to elucidate the virulence potential of the clinical strain. Genome comparison showed high degree of conservation between the clinical strain and the type strain used in food industry, as well as with S. carnosus. The genome of the clinical S. condimenti strain contains few horizontally transferred regions and 37 putative virulence genes, including genes with similarity to leucocidin and genes involved in immune evasion, proinflammatory and cytolytic activity. However, it remains to be tested whether these putative virulence genes are expressed and functional. Although uncommon, S. condimenti may cause severe infection in previously healthy persons.",

            "text": "The genus Staphylococcus consists of more than 50 species, which have traditionally been grouped in coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). The majority of CoNS are commonly found on human and animal skin and mucous membranes, and these have been regarded as nonpathogenic or less virulent compared to the coagulasepositive staphylococci, most notably S. aureus. However, some CoNS, especially S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, are major nosocomial pathogens frequently causing biofilmassociated infections related to prosthetic and other indwelling devices [1]. S. carnosus, S. piscifermentans and S. condimenti make up a phylogenetic subgroup of CoNS that are commonly isolated from or are used in starter cultures of fermented sausage as well as fish and soy sauces [2,3]. These species have until recently not been associated with human disease. The first reported case of a human infection caused by S. condimenti was catheter-related bacteraemia in a 17-year old female patient with severe dilated cardiomyopathy [4]. Given their role in food production, investigating the potential pathogenicity of these species is of importance.",

PCR analyses for mecA, nuc, TSST-1, ETA and ETB genes were negative. The isolate was found to be susceptible to all antibiotics tested (Table 1).

            "text": "We identified 37 putative virulence factors in S. condimenti StO 2014-01, most of which were also found in either S. condimenti DSM 11674 and to a lesser extent in S. carnosus TM300 (Table 4). Notably, S. condimenti StO 2014-01 encodes two proteins containing leukocidin domains that may form a putative bicomponent \u03b2-barrel toxin and have close homologs in S. condimenti DSM 11674. The S. condimenti clinical strain furthermore contains a number of genes which appear to encode functions related to immune evasion and suppression (Table 3). These include proteins encoding domains conserved in staphylococcal superantigens and toxins involved in modulation of T-cell responses [16], immunoglobulin-binding domain B of staphylococcal protein A (SpA), as well as a putative staphopain, extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb), staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN) and secreted von Willebrand factor-binding protein (VWbp). As is common in staphylococci, S. condimenti StO 2014-01 encodes a number of cell wall-anchored proteins, including microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) [17]. The strain furthermore encodes two putative phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), which have been implicated in proinflammatory and cytolytic activity, as well as in biofilmassociated infections [18].",

This is the first reported genome of a S. condimenti strain involved in human disease. We compared the genome of the clinical strain with those of closely related staphylococci, i.e. the S. condimenti type strain DSM 11674 and three strains of S. carnosus, all of which have been isolated from food sources and have been considered to be nonpathogenic, in an attempt to elucidate which virulence traits contributed to the severity of disease observed in this case. S. condimenti was isolated in pure culture from both synovial fluid and several soft tissue samples collected via biopsy during the first revision surgery 4 days after the first treatment for knee injury. S. condimenti must therefore be considered as the definite cause of infection in this case. The infection must also be classified as a severe, life-threatening condition because it progressed, necessitating multiple surgical revisions despite adequate intravenous antibiotic treatment. The 7-year-old patient did not have any known underlying disease or history of infections indicating primary immunodeficiency which could explain her susceptibility to a low-virulent bacterium, in contrast to the recently reported case of catheter-related bacteraemia in a patient with severe dilated cardiomyopathy [4].",

            "text": "Except the single case of infection mentioned earlier, S. condimenti has not previously been reported as a cause of infection in humans. This could reflect the low virulence of the species, but it may also be a consequence of the difficulty in identifying the species by phenotypic methods available in routine laboratories before matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was recently introduced [19]. Regardless, S. condimenti seems to be a rare cause of infections in humans. In a study including 8388 CoNS identified by MALDI-TOF MS from clinical samples in a hospital in France, only three isolates were identified as S. condimenti [19]. Similarly, this bacterial species was identified in only one other clinical sample (one of four blood cultures) in addition to this case in the period since MALDI-TOF MS was introduced in our university hospital laboratory in 2011. Both the clinical isolate and the S. condimenti type strain were susceptible to all antibiotics tested, which is in accordance with previous findings reporting low prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this phylogenetic lineage of Staphylococcus [20]. The protracted course of infection in this patient was therefore not due to lack of susceptibility to the antibiotics used but rather to the aggressive nature of the infection.",

Among these were proteins with similarity to leukocidin, involved in immune evasion, and with proinflammatory and cytolytic activity. However, to what extent these putative virulence factors are expressed and functional was not tested. In a previous study of CoNS isolated from food and starter cultures, no toxin production was found in the two S. condimenti strains tested; however, one strain displayed moderate haemolytic activity on human blood agar [2]. Since most of the putative virulence genes identified in the strain StO 2014-01 were also present in  the type strain S. condimenti DSM 11674, it seems likely that the virulence potential of our clinical strain may also apply to strains associated with food and food production.",
