Incorporating information available at the time of first presentation, this CDR would effectively risk-stratify patients and immediately identify: (A) patients for whom hospitalisation may be safely avoided; and (B) high-risk patients, facilitating judicious use of resources."

            "text": "Methods In two sequential prospective observational cohort studies at heterogeneous centres, we included ED patients with suspected cardiac chest pain. We recorded clinical features and drew blood on arrival. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, prevalent or incident acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation or new coronary stenosis >50%) within 30 days. The CDR was derived by logistic regression, considering reliable (\u03ba>0.6) univariate predictors ( p<0.05) for inclusion. Results In the derivation study (n=698) we derived a CDR including eight variables (high sensitivity troponin T; heart-type fatty acid binding protein; ECG ischaemia; diaphoresis observed; vomiting; pain radiation to right arm/shoulder; worsening angina; hypotension), which had a C-statistic of 0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.97) implying near perfect diagnostic performance. On external validation (n=463) the CDR identified 27.0% of patients as 'very low risk' and potentially suitable for discharge from the ED. 0.0% of these patients had prevalent acute myocardial infarction and 1.6% developed MACE (n=2; both coronary stenoses without revascularisation). 9.9% of patients were classified as 'high-risk', 95.7% of whom developed MACE. Conclusions The Manchester Acute Coronary Syndromes (MACS) rule has the potential to safely reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and facilitate judicious use of high dependency resources."

This has great potential benefit for patients, who could be immediately reassured that they do not have AMI and that any appropriate follow-up can safely be arranged on an outpatient basis. Given the large number of patients affected (over a quarter of acute medical admissions), use of the MACS rule may help to relieve the increasing pressure on EDs, where overcrowding is associated with more patient safety incidents and rising mortality. 19 The potential cost saving for health services is also substantial. In addition to identifying very low risk patients for whom unnecessary hospital admission may be avoided, the MACS rule risk stratifies the remaining patients. While the low and moderate risk patients still require further inpatient investigation before an acute coronary syndrome can be confirmed or excluded, patients in the high-risk group had a very high prevalence of AMI and incidence of MACE, potentially facilitating selective specialist referral and targeting of high dependency resources with high specificity and PPV.",

Several CDRs have been derived for use in the ED population, although their usefulness is limited by low specificity and none were derived in the era of high sensitivity troponins. 20 21 Serial biomarker testing over 60-120 min could facilitate safe early discharge of low-risk patients with chest pain, [22][23][24][25] although such strategies may not always be cost-effective. 26 Using high sensitivity troponin alone it may be possible to exclude AMI within 60-180 min of presentation. 27 28  The model estimates the probability (p) of MACE as follows (rounded values are presented): p=1/(1+e \u2212(0.068a + 0.17b + 1.75c + 1.85d + 1.72e + 1.46f + 0.92g + 0.87h \u2212 4.83) ). For each categorical variable, a value of 1 is assigned if the characteristic is present and 0 if absent. *ORs are presented for a 1 unit increase (ng/L for hs-cTnT; ng/mL for H-FABP).

It has the potential to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions by facilitating the immediate discharge of over a quarter of patients using a single blood test at the time of arrival. The MACS rule also effectively risk stratifies the remaining patients, identifying high-risk patients with high PPV and suggesting courses of action to the clinician. We hope that this will prevent a rebound overuse of resources, as has happened with previous rapid rule-out strategies that have high sensitivity but relatively low specificity. 26 The MACS rule has several novel features. It combines clinical and biochemical data and incorporates contemporary biomarker levels, which are considered as continuous variables. This maximises the richness of diagnostic information that may be lost by dichotomisation and enables levels even below the 99th centile to influence the initial risk stratification, building and improving upon a previous analysis from our derivation cohort. 4 We also consider that inclusion of a second prospective external validation study is a strength of this report. This work enabled the performance of the MACS rule to be verified in a heterogeneous (as demonstrated in table 1) and independent population, reducing the potential for statistical overfitting and overestimation of diagnostic performance.",

This strategy has shown promise when used with biomarker panels and serial troponin testing, particularly in low-risk patients. 22 23 27 Future work should explore whether refinements to include early serial sampling will enhance diagnostic performance of the MACS rule.
