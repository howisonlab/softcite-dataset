            "text": "Methods In two sequential prospective observational cohort studies at heterogeneous centres, we included ED patients with suspected cardiac chest pain. We recorded clinical features and drew blood on arrival. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, prevalent or incident acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation or new coronary stenosis >50%) within 30 days. The CDR was derived by logistic regression, considering reliable (\u03ba>0.6) univariate predictors ( p<0.05) for inclusion. Results In the derivation study (n=698) we derived a CDR including eight variables (high sensitivity troponin T; heart-type fatty acid binding protein; ECG ischaemia; diaphoresis observed; vomiting; pain radiation to right arm/shoulder; worsening angina; hypotension), which had a C-statistic of 0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.97) implying near perfect diagnostic performance. On external validation (n=463) the CDR identified 27.0% of patients as 'very low risk' and potentially suitable for discharge from the ED. 0.0% of these patients had prevalent acute myocardial infarction and 1.6% developed MACE (n=2; both coronary stenoses without revascularisation). 9.9% of patients were classified as 'high-risk', 95.7% of whom developed MACE. Conclusions The Manchester Acute Coronary Syndromes (MACS) rule has the potential to safely reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and facilitate judicious use of high dependency resources.",

Based on the estimated probability assigned by the model, The MACS rule stratified patients into four risk groups (figure 2). The MACS rule successfully stratified patients according to their risk of MACE and AMI. Its use could have enabled the 35.5% of patients in the MACS rule 'very low risk' group to be immediately discharged with zero (0.0%) missed AMIs and one (0.4%) missed MACE (a patient with normal ECG and normal troponin who underwent inpatient coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention to lesions in the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries).

This has great potential benefit for patients, who could be immediately reassured that they do not have AMI and that any appropriate follow-up can safely be arranged on an outpatient basis. Given the large number of patients affected (over a quarter of acute medical admissions), use of the MACS rule may help to relieve the increasing pressure on EDs, where overcrowding is associated with more patient safety incidents and rising mortality. 19 The potential cost saving for health services is also substantial. In addition to identifying very low risk patients for whom unnecessary hospital admission may be avoided, the MACS rule risk stratifies the remaining patients. While the low and moderate risk patients still require further inpatient investigation before an acute coronary syndrome can be confirmed or excluded, patients in the high-risk group had a very high prevalence of AMI and incidence of MACE, potentially facilitating selective specialist referral and targeting of high dependency resources with high specificity and PPV.",

The MACS rule also effectively risk stratifies the remaining patients, identifying high-risk patients with high PPV and suggesting courses of action to the clinician. We hope that this will prevent a rebound overuse of resources, as has happened with previous rapid rule-out strategies that have high sensitivity but relatively low specificity. 26 The MACS rule has several novel features. It combines clinical and biochemical data and incorporates contemporary biomarker levels, which are considered as continuous variables. This maximises the richness of diagnostic information that may be lost by dichotomisation and enables levels even below the 99th centile to influence the initial risk stratification, building and improving upon a previous analysis from our derivation cohort. 4 We also consider that inclusion of a second prospective external validation study is a strength of this report.

Again, two (1.6%) patients in the very low risk group developed MACE, which were both coronary stenoses not deemed to warrant revascularisation. The AUC was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.95). As a dichotomous tool for facilitating immediate hospital discharge, the MACS rule had an overall sensitivity of 98.4% (94.3% to 99.8%) and NPV 97.9% (92.8% to 99.8%) for MACE. For AMI, the sensitivity was 100.0% (95.3% to 100.0%) and NPV 100.0% (97.0% to 100.0%).",

External validation The performance of the MACS rule on external validation is shown in figure 3. Again, the MACS rule effectively stratified patients according to their risk of MACE and AMI. The rule had an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.95) for MACE. The 125 (27.0%) patients in the 'very low risk' group could have been immediately discharged with zero (0.0%) missed AMIs and two (1.6%) MACEs within 30 days. Both of these events were coronary stenoses detected at angiography but that were not deemed to warrant coronary intervention. Thus the MACS rule would have enabled decisions to admit or discharge patients to have been made with a sensitivity of 98.0% (95% CI 93.0% to 99.8%) and NPV 98.7% (95.3% to 99.8%) for MACE. For AMI, the MACS rule had a sensitivity of 100.0% (95% CI 95.4% to 100.0%) and NPV 100.0% (97.1% to 100.0%). Of the 'high-risk'",
