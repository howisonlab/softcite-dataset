Capture-recapture analysis was performed on specific industries and occupations when the number of overlapping reports was \u22657.

Capture-recapture models allow the estimation of the true number of cases and the assessment of the completeness of the surveillance data. This methodology has been used in a variety of public health areas. 23,35 The NIOSH in the United States used capture-recapture methods and estimated that the \"true\" number of WRA cases was approximately 6-to 7-fold higher than the number reported using surveillance data.26 In our study, the estimated \"true\" number of cases was approximately double the reported number. Approximately 80.1% (n=189) of all reported WRA cases were found in the manufacturing sector, including furniture manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, vehicle manufacturing, and food and beverage manufacturing. The rates in these manufacturing industries were higher than those in almost all other industries. The WRA incidence was highest in the furniture manufacturing industry (67.62/million), likely due to the high rate of isocyanate use, which is the leading cause in the development of WRA.",

            "text": "As in other countries, 7,8,25,27,[38][39][40] the most common cause of WRA in Korea was exposure to isocyanates, but the proportion of WRA cases attributed to isocyanates in Korea (46.6%) was much higher than that in other countries (13.6%-23.1%). Possi-  ble reasons were that claims for compensation are generally approved whenever isocyanate is present at the workplace regardless of the actual WRA cause and reporting physicians are familiar with the processes leading to isocyanate exposure. The second most common cause of WRA in our study was grain dust, which was possibly due to a large number of WRA cases identified during an epidemiological investigation at a bakery. 41 Approximately 5%-10% of bakery workers are thought to have WRA. 42 Moreover, the actual number of cases of WRA caused by grain dust may have been much higher, considering that agriculture workers in small companies (<5 workers) and the self-employed are not eligible for workers' compensation in Korea. 33 Some new and emerging causes of WRA were also identified by the KOWAS. Examples include azodicarbonamide 43 (used as a plastic foaming agent) and cyanoacrylate 44 (used as an instant glue), both of which had not previously been observed to cause WRA in Korea. The pattern of isocyanate exposure being the dominant cause of WRA in Korea tended to diminish over time. Factors responsible for this decrease may include recent increased awareness and recognition of other causes of WRA, and a true reduction in the incidence of isocyanate-induced WRA, a sensitizer-induced OA. Reductions in the incidence of isocyanate-induced WRA were also observed in France. 32 Few cases of irritant-induced OA were identified by the KOWAS. This may be because an understanding of the role of respiratory irritants in the etiology of OA is too recent a phenomenon to be captured by the KOWAS data. 45 This analysis has several limitations. Although isocyanates were the most common cause of WRA, in some instances of isocyanate-caused WRA, an agent other than isocyanates may have caused the asthma. Second, the reported rates are likely to be underestimates. Many cases of WRA are never ascertained or reported. This is because many workers are not covered by workers' compensation, or because many physicians fail either to diagnose WRA or to report WRA to the KOWAS. Third, detailed information on the specific objective diagnostic tests that were used to assess the work-relatedness criteria were often not available to the KOWAS. In these instances, the KOWAS relied on the work-relatedness assessment made by the reporting source. Fourth, the specific causal agent of WRA could not be identified because objective tests on the specific agents were either not conducted or the test results were not available to the KOWAS. A similar lack of specificity is present in WRA reports from other countries. 7,8,24,25,[27][28][29] The effectiveness of the KOWAS could be improved if it was supported by active and ongoing work-related disease surveillance schemes and occasional company-wide health evaluations. The latter, prompted by findings made during the course of our surveillance study, helped to identify many additional WRA cases in a bakery. After a sentinel case of baker's asthma from an industrial bakery was reported to the KOWAS in Octo-Allergy Asthma Immunol Res. 2015 January;7(1):51-59. http://dx.doi.org/10.4168/aair.2015.7.1.51 ber 2005, a thorough epidemiological investigation was performed by the KOSHA in 2006-2007. 41 As a result, 12 additional workers were diagnosed with baker's asthma and reported to the KOWAS. In other cases where the causal agents could not be identified, or their work-relatedness could not be established, the KOWAS findings prompted additional epidemiological investigations. 46,47 Before the KOWAS was established, the only method to estimate rates of WRA in Korea was by analyzing data from workers' compensation reports. However, many WRA patients do not apply for workers' compensation. The KOWAS scheme was designed to overcome this limitation. From 1997-2003, the number of cases of WRA from workers compensation ranged from 4-29. During the study period (2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009), the total number of WRA cases identified by the KOWAS was more than double the number of cases identified by the worker's compensation scheme alone. As a public health surveillance system, the objective of the KOWAS is not only to estimate the magnitude of WRA, but to also analyze WRA trends in Korea, to detect emerging causes of WRA, and to guide policy changes and workplace interventions in order to prevent WRA and promote worker health.",
