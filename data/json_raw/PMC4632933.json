The relationship between UGT1A1 genotypes and patient outcomes was also assessed. Method: Patients with untreated ES-SCLC were randomly assigned to receive either IP or EP, and blood specimens were collected to test the genotypes of UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6. The association of efficacy and toxicity of an IP regimen with UGT1A1 genotype was analyzed. Results: Of the 62 patients enrolled from three institutions, 30 patients were in the IP and 32 patients were in the EP arms, respectively. Disease control rates with IP and EP were 83.3% and 71.9%, respectively (P = 0.043). Median progression-free survival for IP and EP were both six months. Median overall survival for IP and EP were 18.1 and 15.8 months respectively, without significant difference. Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia was more common with EP (18.8% vs. 6.7%; P = 0.035), while the incidence of diarrhea was higher with IP (70% vs. 15.6%; P = 0.008). The incidence of grade 1-4 late-onset diarrhea of wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous UGT1A1*28 were 65.0%, 85.7%, and 66.7%, respectively (P = 0.037). UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and chemotherapy cycles were essential factors affecting grade 1-4 late-onset diarrhea in logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: The efficacy of the IP regimen was similar to the EP regimen for untreated ES-SCLC. UGT1A1 polymorphisms were associated with late-onset diarrhea; however, there was no influence on efficacy.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in China with an estimated 610 000 new cases in 2010. 1 Smallcell lung cancer (SCLC) now accounts for 10-15% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer cases, and 60-70% of patients present with extensive stage (ES). 2 Over the past 20 years, standard therapy for most patients with ES-SCLC has been either carboplatin or cisplatin in combination with etoposide. 3 In 2002, Japanese investigators reported superior results with the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan combined with cisplatin (IP) compared with standard therapy with etoposide plus cisplatin (EP) in a randomized phase III trial comprising 154 patients with ES-SCLC. 4 Prolonged median overall survival (OS) (12.8 vs. 9.4 months; P = 0.002) and a non-significantly higher two-year survival rate of 19.5% versus 5.2% were observed in the IP treatment arm compared with the EP arm. Patients in the EP arm experienced significantly higher rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, but lower rates of grade 3/4 diarrhea than those in the IP arm. However, two subsequent large phase III trials performed in the United States (US) comparing IP with EP failed to show a significant difference in response rate or OS between the regimens. 5,6 Moreover, grade 3/4 hematological toxic effects were more frequent in both EP and IP arms in Japanese compared to Western patients. 7 It is possible that the differences in efficacy and toxicity in these randomized trials may partly be because the polymorphisms of genes involved in the metabolism or transport of chemotherapy vary among ethnic populations. 6 The present study was designed to compare the efficacy of EP and IP in untreated patients with ES-SCLC in a multicenter setting. Additionally, we sought to explore the distribution of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) polymorphisms and to find out the relationship between UGT1A1 genotypes and patient outcomes, as well as incidence of diarrhea after chemotherapy.",

Disease control rate (DCR) was calculated as the percentage of patients who achieved CR, PR, and stable disease (SD). Assessment was conducted at least every two cycles. Safety was evaluated using treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) graded according to National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). All patients were counseled about the importance of early recognition and treatment of diarrhea. OS was measured as the date of treatment to the date of death or the date of the most recent follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured as the date of treatment to the date of the first observation of disease progression or the date of death from any cause if there had been no progression. After all cycles of treatment, routine follow-up by imaging analysis was performed every two months until the date of death. The last follow-up date was 30 December 2012.

            "text": "The current standard chemotherapy for ES-SCLC is an EP or IP regimen. Noda et al. first reported a phase III study (JCOG9511) of an IP compared with an EP regimen in 154 patients with ES-SCLC. During interim analysis, they found significant differences in OS and a toxicity profile in favor of the IP arm and, thus, prematurely closed the study. However, large randomized trials conducted in North America, including the Southwest Oncology Group trial (SWOG S0124) using almost the same eligibility criteria and identical   treatment regimens as JCOG9511, did not confirm the JCOG9511 results. Despite several negative trials, two metaanalyses using non-individual patient data showed a significant survival improvement with IP compared with EP in patients with ES-SCLC. 9,10 This multicenter, phase II, randomized study did not reveal a statistically significant difference in OS and PFS between the IP and EP regimens; however, the DCR in the IP arm was 83.3%, higher than the EP arm (71.9%; P = 0.043) and similar to JCOG9511 results. Non-hematological adverse events were much the same between the two groups, except the incidence of diarrhea was 70.0% in the IP arm and 15.6% in the EP arm (P = 0.008). However, the IP arm was associated with significantly lower rates of grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia (P = 0.035). Our results are consistent with previous trials, which reported that the IP regimen produced more nonhematological toxicities and less hematological toxicities compared with the EP regimen. [4][5][6][7] A comparative analysis of response rates and toxicities between the IP arms of JCOG9511 and SWOG S0124 suggests that pharmacogenomic factors may account for differences in the efficacy and toxicities seen in the two trials. 7 In the IP arms, the incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia was 65% in the JCOG 9511 trial and 34% in the SWOG S0124 trial (P < 0.001). Many studies have indicated that SN38 glucuronidation activity and irinotecan-induced toxicity are associated with UGT1A1*28, which generates a repeat polymorphism in the TATA box promoter of UGT1A1, demonstrating a lower allele frequency in Asians compared with Caucasians. 11 There is fairly strong evidence that individuals with the homozygote UGT1A1*28 genotype tend to have a higher prevalence of irinotecan-induced neutropenia. [12][13][14] Ferraldeschi et al. observed an association between the UGT1A1*28 genotype and diarrhea; however, other studies have reported no statistically significant association. [15][16][17] A meta-analysis reported that patients carrying UGT1A1*28 alleles are at an increased risk of severe diarrhea, and this increased risk is only apparent in those who are administered medium or high doses of irinotecan. 18 Moreover, there was a significant linear correlation between irinotecan doses and related odds ratios (ORs) of severe diarrhea; however, this association was only observed when comparing the risk of diarrhea between patients with a homozygous UGT1A1*28 genotype and those carrying wild-type alleles. 18 In the present study, the incidence of grade 1-4 diarrhea was related to UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms (P = 0.037); however the relationship of the severe diarrhea (grade 3-4) and UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms was not observed.",

However, a reduction in dosage might also be associated with reduced tumor response and/or increased morbidity. 22 In 2009, the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention Working Group reported that routine UGT1A1 genotyping for guiding irinotecan dosing is not recommended. 23 Definitive evidence of whether the UGT1A1*28 genotype is associated with clinical outcomes of irinotecan-based chemotherapy is not yet available to assist in a clinical setting. As for the correlation between efficacy and the UGT1A1 genotype, we did not observe a significant difference in our study. Our result was consistent with Liu et al.'s meta-analysis, in which no association between UGT1A1*28 genotypes and IP response was found. 24 However, the UGT1A1*28 allele showed significant or marginal association with poorer OS, especially in the low dose irinotecan subgroup of the homozygous model. Furthermore, the irinotecan dose also did not impact upon therapeutic response or PFS according to UGT1A1 genotype. 25 In conclusion, the present study failed to show a significant superiority in efficacy for the IP regimen compared with the standard of care EP for ES-SCLC. The UGT1A1 genotype has an influence on late-onset diarrhea, but there was no evidence of UGT1A1 having an impact on the efficacy of the IP regimen for SCLC.
