A 3 factor 2 level design was used to derive a polynomial quadratic model and construct contour plots to predict responses. the independent variables selected were concentration of drug (A), concentration of pLGA/peG-pLGA (B), pVA concentration in aqueous phase (C) and sonication time (D) and evaluated for percentage drug entrapment (pDe) and particle size (pS). A 3 4 factorial design was used with 4 factors (A, B, C and D) at 3 levels and experimental trials were performed at all 82 possible combinations. In the present work, 28 runs are considered as the preliminary trials revealed that on increasing drug concentration from 2.5 to 5 mg the percent drug entrapment increases, but on further increasing the drug concentration (i.e., to 7.5 mg) no significant effect on the percent drug entrapment and particle size was observed. the 3 4 factorial design was used to derive a polynomial quadratic model and construct contour plots to predict responses. Contour plots were constructed to show the effects of A, B, C and D on the pDe and pS.",

DOE is an approach for effectively and efficiently exploring the cause and effect relationship between numerous process variables and the output. A sequence of experiments were performed that would yield the most information about the factors and their interactions in as few experiments as possible. A 4-factor 3-level factorial experimental design technique was employed to investigate the variables like particle size and percent drug entrapment using the statistical software package (Version 7). This technique was applied to quantify the influence of operating parameters on the production of nanoparticles.",

However, it would be difficult visually to make predictions as to whether the interactions actually existed between the variables, or which single variable had the most dominant effect. To achieve this, factorial statistical design methods were applied and these designs are good alternatives to a full factorial design, especially in the initial screening stage. In this study a 4-factorial design was used where main factor effects are confounded with two factor and higher order interactions. The main effects and interaction effects calculated for the responses of particle size and entrapment efficiency. 1,2 In the present study emulsification solvent evaporation method was used for preparation and optimization of temozolomide loaded Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles, as this method is widely used for the encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs.

The independent variable selected were, concentration of drug (A), concentration of PLGA/ PEG-PLGA (B), PVA concentration in aqueous phase (C) and sonication time (D). Hence, a 3 4 factorial design was used with 4 factors (A, B, C and D) at 3 levels and experimental trials were performed at all 82 possible combinations which reveals that on The main effect of A, B, C and D represents the average result of changing variable at a time from its low level to high level. The interaction terms (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, A 2 , B 2 , C 2 and D 2 ) show how the PDE changes when 2 variables are simultaneously changed. The negative coefficient for all the independent variables (D, AC, BD, A 2 , C 2 and D 2 ) indicate unfavorable effect on the PDE while others are exhibiting positive interaction which indicate favorable effect on the PDE as its concentration in all selected formulation is kept unchanged. Among the four independent variables the lowest coefficient value is for D (\u22120.36 and p < 0.05) indicating that this variable is insignificant in the prediction of PDE. It is also observed that the PDE does not significantly change (p < 0.05) because as on changing sonication time from 30 sec to 90 sec there is very little decrease in the PDE which shows very less amount of drug loss due to size reduction of the nanoparticles. Similarly, the effect of PVA on the PDE of various nanoparticles was observed and as on increasing the PVA concentration from 0.5 to 1% in nanoparticles the PDE increases significantly while on further increasing PVA concentration of PEGylation of nanoparticles. The PDE (dependent variable) obtained at various levels of 4 independent variables (A, B, C and D). The response surface quadratic models were generated using Expert Design Software. These were subjected to multiple regression to yield a second order polynomial equations (full model). The correlation coefficient for the models were also calculated which are found to be > 0.94 indicating good fit. The PDE values measured for various batches showed wide variation i.e., ranges from a minimum of 52.89% to a maximum of 77.96% in case of temozolomide bearing Non-PEGylated nanoparticles, while a minimum of 49.62% to a maximum of 75.91% in case temozolomide bearing PEGylated nanoparticles. It is clearly indicated that the PDE is strongly affected by the variables selected for the study. It is observed that as on increasing the concentration of PLGA polymer in the matrix of nanoparticles the percent drug entrapment was found to increased up to the level of medium (i.e., 50 mg) at 5 mg of drug concentration then very little change in PDE was observed which could be due to completely entrapment of the drug into the polymer matrix. is desirable. In our case the Adeq-Precision value is in range of 26-28 which indicates an adequate signal ( Tables 5 and 6). Particle size. Nanoparticles are formed when specific concentration of PLGA and PVA were mixed together. All the batches of Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles within the experimental design were also evaluated for their particle size. The transformed values for particle size of all the batches (28 each) of Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles bearing temozolomide TMZ along with the results are shown in Tables 1  and 2. The results show that formulations no. 10, 19, 20 and 22 from each class of formulations are exhibiting minimum particle size, i.e., < 114 nm for Non-PEGylated nanoparticles, while it is increased about 6 nm more in case of PEGylation of nanoparticles which might be due to the diffusion of the copolymer solubilized in the organic phase leads to an homogenous distribution of the PEG chain on the surface of the droplets and on the surface of the NPs after solvent evaporation. The PS (dependent variable) obtained at various levels of 4 independent variables (A, B, C and D). The response surface quadratic models were generated using Expert Design Software. These were subjected to multiple regression to yield a second order polynomial equations (full model). The correlation coefficient for the models were also calculated which are found to be > 0.96 indicating good fit. The particle size of various nanoparticles formulations showed wide variation i.e., ranges from a minimum of 111.91 nm to a maximum of 120.88 no significant change in PDE was observed in all the cases of nanoparticles formulations. This shows an appropriate concentration of PVA (surfactant 1%) for the better formation of emulsion. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) measures how much the variance of that model coefficient is inflated by the lack of orthogonality in the design and calculated for Non-PEGylated and PEGylated formulations for temozolomide which is found to be near 1 indicating good estimation of the coefficient (Tables 3  and 4). Similarly Ri-squared is near to zero which is leading to good model. The model F value calculated in the range of 75.15 to 81.00 which implies the models are significant. The values of Prob > F less than 0.05 are indicating that model terms are significant. In all cases A, B, C, D, AB, A 2 and B 2 are significant model terms. The lack of fit values \"F-value\" for Non-PEGylated nanoparticles was found to be 61.86, which implies the lack of fit is not significant relative to the pure error and there are only 10-11% chances of large lack of fit \"F-value\" which could occur due to noise and non-significant lack of fit \"F-value\" is good fit of model. Similar results were obtained in PEGylated nanoparticles bearing temozolomide where lack of fit \"F-value\" was found to be 11.44% which is non-significant related to pure error. In both these cases 17-23% chances of large lack of fit \"F-value\" could occur due to noise. In both cases \"Pred R-squared\" values are in reasonable agreement with the \"Adj R-squared\" values. The Adeq-Precision is the measures of the signal to noise ratio.

This compound is the most widely used initiator as it provides high reaction ratio, and high molar mass even under relatively mild conditions. 4 Briefly, lactide and glycolide in a molar ratio of 4:1 and the specified amount of Bis-PEG were put in thick-walled glass tubes. The total weight of the feed was about 3 g. Stannous octoate was dissolved in hexane and added at a concentration of 0.03% by the weight of the feed. Then, the tubes were heated at 190\u00b0C for the 2 h. The resulting copolymer was purified by dissolving in chloroform and then precipitating in an excess methanol. The purified copolymer was dried under vaccum. 5 Preparation of non-PEGylated nanoparticles. Drug loaded Non-PEGylated nanoparticles were prepared using emulsification solvent evaporation method (Avgoustakis, 2004) which is widely used for the encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs. Briefly, temozolomide (5 mg) and PLGA (50 mg) were dissolved in acetone (5 ml) (organic phase). The organic phase was added at a constant flow rate (0.3 ml/min) into 20 ml of aqueous phase containing 1% of PVA under intense shear using probe sonicator (Lark Innovative Fine Tecknowledge). The resultant mixture was further stirred for 2 h using magnetic stirrer. The organic solvent was then evaporated off under vacuum using a rotavapor (Steroglass). Then NPs were lyophilized (Heto Drywiner) at \u221246\u00b0C, 0.001 atm for 24 h with 5% w/w mannitol which was used as cryoprotectant (Yin et al., 2006). 6 Preparation of PEGylated nanoparticles. PEGylated nanoparticles were also prepared by emulsification solvent evaporation method. All the parameters were kept same except the PLGA polymer was replaced with PEG PLGA Copolymer. These Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles were stored in a tightly closed container until further evaluation.",
