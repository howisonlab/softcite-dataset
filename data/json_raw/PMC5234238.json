            "text": "Background Although intravenous acyclovir therapy is recommended for varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection in immunocompromised children, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of VZV infection in the acyclovir era have rarely been reported. Methods The medical records of children diagnosed with varicella or herpes zoster virus, who had underlying hematologic malignancies, were retrospectively reviewed, and the clinical characteristics and outcomes of VZV infection were evaluated. Results Seventy-six episodes of VZV infection (herpes zoster in 57 and varicella in 19) were identified in 73 children. The median age of children with VZV infection was 11 years (range, 1-17), and 35 (46.1%) episodes occurred in boys. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the most common underlying malignancy (57.9%), and 90.8% of the episodes occurred during complete remission of the underlying malignancy. Acyclovir was administered for a median of 10 days (range, 4-97). Severe VZV infection occurred in 16 (21.1%) episodes. Although the finding was not statistically significant, a previous history of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) appeared to be associated with the development of more severe episodes of herpes zoster (P=0.075). Conclusion Clinical characteristics of VZV infection in immunocompromised children were not significantly different from those without it, and clinical outcomes improved after the introduction of acyclovir therapy. However, risk factors for severe VZV infection require further investigation in a larger population and a prospective setting.",

            "text": "Primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) in children causes varicella, after which VZV maintains latency in the dorsal root ganglia [1]. The latent VZV may be reactivated and cause herpes zoster when host cellular immunity is weakened [1], and 27.9% of children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experience herpes zoster during their primary chemotherapy course [2]. Most immunocompetent patients spontaneously recover from varicella and herpes zoster with only symptomatic therapy and rarely experience complications [3], whereas morbidity and mortality due to varicella and herpes zoster are increased in immunocompromised patients [4][5][6][7]. Before the introduction of antiviral therapy for VZV infection, 31.7% of children diagnosed with varicella during chemotherapy for acute leukemia experienced visceral dissemination of VZV, and 6.7% of these children died [4]. Without antiviral therapy, complications and deaths due to herpes zoster in children with cancers occurred in 11.9% and 3.0% of patients, respectively [5]. Although a decrease in severe infections and deaths due to VZV infection has been noted in immunocompromised children treated with antiviral therapy, reports on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of VZV infection in immunocompromised children after the introduction of antiviral therapy are rare [2].",

Among this group, children with underlying hematologic malignancies (acute/chronic leukemia and lymphoma) were included in the present study. Demographic characteristics including gender and age and clinical characteristics including the type and status of underlying hematologic malignancy, chemotherapy administered before the development of VZV infection, symptoms accompanying VZV infection, severe infections involving organs or multiple dermatomes, and the duration of antiviral therapy were investigated. Laboratory test results including white blood cell (WBC) count; absolute neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts (not shown); erythrocyte sedimentation rate; and C-reactive protein level at the time of diagnosis of VZV infection were also investigated. In addition, the presence of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM against VZV, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for VZV in the serum, and Tzanck test results were investigated. The enrolled children were divided into two groups based on the development of complications associated with each of the VZV infections: varicella and herpes zoster; complicated infections were defined as proven or probable organ involvement without evidence of diseases other than VZV, or cutaneous dissemination of herpes zoster. The investigated demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were compared between the two groups for each presentation of VZV infection. The present study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, and the requirement for informed consent was waived (Approval No.: KC15RISI0233).",

The diagnosis of varicella and herpes zoster were performed by two independent pediatricians based on clinical manifestations. Herpes zoster was diagnosed when pruritic papulovesicular skin lesions developed with a dermatomal distribution, and varicella was diagnosed when the characteristic skin lesions were scattered and without a dermatomal distribution [8]. Cutaneous dissemination of herpes zoster was diagnosed when two or more separated dermatomes were involved. Visceral organ involvement was diagnosed based not on the histologic findings of the biopsied tissue but on the clinical and laboratory findings. Pneumonia was diagnosed in cases when abnormal breathing sounds were heard on auscultation and chest radiography revealed abnormal infiltrations in a child with respiratory symptoms. Hepatitis was diagnosed when the serum aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase levels increased two-fold or more during VZV infection compared with the levels measured before VZV infection in a child with symptoms consistent with acute hepatitis, such as abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Cases in which other causes of hepatitis or pneumonia were ruled out via respiratory viral PCR or serologic studies were considered complicated VZV infections. Meningitis was diagnosed when a cerebrospinal fluid sample collected from a child with neurological symptoms such as headache, seizures, and paralysis showed pleocytosis (WBC count \uff1e5 cells/\u03bcL), and encephalitis was diagnosed when seizures or mental dysfunction was present in a child with meningitis. Severe infections due to VZV were associated with visceral organ involvement, cutaneous dissemination of herpes zoster, and intensive care unit (ICU) care and/or deaths.",

Herpes zoster occurred more frequently in children with ALL compared to those with acute myeloid leukemia or solid tumors [5,6], and more than half of the enrolled children in the present study had underlying ALL. In children with ALL, the rate of occurrence of herpes zoster differed according to the children's risk groups [2], and most of the children with underlying ALL in the present study were included in a very high-risk group (data not shown). This result may be attributable to differences in the intensity of administered chemotherapy according to the risk group [2]. In addition, older children were included in the higher-risk groups, and VZV infection tends to occur more frequently in older children compared with younger children. In previous studies, VZV infection was found to be more severe among HCT recipients than in other immunocompromised patients [9,10], but no statistically significant difference was observed. Abdominal pain preceding the development of skin lesions has been associated with an increased severity of VZV infection [7,11], and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred more frequently in children with complications than in those without complications in the present study, although the difference was not statistically significant. Some previous studies reported that low absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is associated with development of visceral dissemination and increased mortality in children with cancer and varicella [4,6]; similarly, in the present study, a low ALC was related to the development of complicated varicella (P =0.047).",

            "text": "Currently, intravenous acyclovir has been recommended for the treatment of VZV infection in children with underlying acute leukemia who are receiving HCT [1]; therefore, all children enrolled in the present study received intravenous acyclovir therapy and were hospitalized immediately after the clinical diagnosis of VZV infection. However, universal hospitalization for intravenous acyclovir therapy caused increase of hospital costs and complications related to injection as well as concern of the development of hospi-tal-acquired infection. Considering the favorable therapeutic effect of acyclovir on VZV infection in immunocompromised children, oral acyclovir therapy could be an option in cases of uncomplicated VZV infections. S\u00f8rensen et al. [2] reported that there were no cases of visceral involvement and no deaths in children with ALL and herpes zoster receiving oral acyclovir therapy for 5 to 10 days. Because of its low bioavailability in oral acyclovir, studies have been conducted on the therapeutic effect of valacyclovir and famciclovir, which have improved oral bioavailability [12,13]. The use of oral famciclovir and valacyclovir has been approved for varicella and herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults, and the therapeutic effect of these agents has been proved in immunocompromised adults with VZV infection [12,13]. Although there has been no randomized controlled study that has examined the therapeutic effect of valacyclovir and famciclovir in immunocompromised children with VZV infection, a therapeutic effect of famciclovir on VZV infection in immunocompetent children has been reported [14]. In immunocompromised children, it was reported that a therapeutic blood drug level could be maintained with oral valacyclovir therapy [15]. Therefore, further studies evaluating the clinical therapeutic effect of oral famciclovir and valacyclovir in immunocompromised children with varicella and herpes zoster should be performed. Until then, oral acyclovir therapy may be applicable in immunocompromised children without risk factors for complicated VZV infection. Although our study failed to show significant association between previous history of HCT and development of complicated VZV infection, some studies reported that a previous history of HCT was related to severe VZV infections [9,10], and severe VZV infection increased in patients with ALL who received steroid therapy within 3 weeks [16]. Accordingly, oral acyclovir therapy can be tried in cases of immunocompromised children who have not undergone HCT and have not recently received steroid therapy.",

If we consider that varicella vaccination has been universally administered in Korea since 2005 as part of the National Immunization Program, future studies should be performed to evaluate the effect of previous vaccination on the incidence of VZV infection in immunocompromised children. However, some children who were seropositive for VZV at the time of diagnosis of leukemia became seronegative after chemotherapy [18], and 59.5% of the children tested for IgG against VZV in the present study were seropositive for VZV despite the development of VZV infection. Considering that the cellular immunity has an important role in controlling VZV infection [1], an estimation of cellular immune responses to VZV rather than humoral immunity may be useful for predicting the development of VZV infection and its complications. In the present study, cases of clinically diagnosed VZV infection were investigated. It is known that VZV PCR is a very sensitive tool for detecting VZV infection, VZV PCR tests with serum were performed in only 35 (46.1%) episodes of our study and the results were positive in 51.5% of tests.The VZV PCR using blood samples is helpful to verify the potential risk for viral dissemination, and VZV PCR using vesicular swabs is a more accurate tool for the diagnosis of VZV infection [19]. Therefore, in future studies, the relationship between VZV PCR in the serum and complicated VZV infection should be investigated.",
