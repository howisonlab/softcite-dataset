            "text": "Ranibizumab is a fragment of humanized anti-VEGF antibody specifically designed for ophthalmic use. Recent randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy, tolerability and safety of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy in eyes with DME, and that the benefit is maintained for over 2 years [3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. Bevacizumab is a full-length antibody. Although it is an off-label option, its intravitreal use in DME is supported by prospective studies [10,11] and has risen exponentially because of economic considerations [3,12]. Current first-line treatment of DME is primarily based on a loading dosage of anti-VEGF compounds, followed by a pro re nata treatment regimen with monthly monitoring [13]. Either ranibizumab or bevacizumab serve as first line therapy in these cases [12].",

This suggests that switching the compound in DME may benefit in cases with primary failure ( fig. 1) bevacizumab and ranibizumab properties are thought to explain the positive action of ranibizumab in cases of bevacizumab failure in patients with AMD [18]. Such differences include the smaller size of the ranibizumab molecule and its higher affinity for VEGF that may be of potential importance in diabetic retinopathy. Ranibizumab is thought to have a greater affinity for binding VEGF and that might be advantageous in diseases featuring high concentrations of VEGF, such as diabetic patients [26]. Positive effects of ranibizumab after bevacizumab failure have been described in central retinal vein occlusion, a condition also characterized by high concentrations of VEGF [27]. Four eyes that were included in the study demonstrated a secondary failure of response to bevacizumab. In AMD, such a condition has been attributed to tachyphylaxis [25,28]. The cases described in this paper suggest that tachyphylaxis should also be investigated in DME. It also implies that tachyphylaxis might be an eye rather than a patient phenomenon as shown on the 3 patients who had both eyes injected simultaneously, 2 patients had 1 eye responding initially, and the fellow one was non-responding at all. As recently demonstrated in AMD [25][26][27][28][29], our study suggests that in patients with DME experiencing a waning effect of bevacizumab, they may respond favorably to a switch to ranibizumab.",
