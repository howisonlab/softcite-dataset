            "text": "Background: Continuous epidural analgesia with catheterization is a useful technique, because it has a wide adaptation range and provides prolonged analgesia. Problems that may arise from long-term epidural analgesia are changes in the analgesic area, duration of analgesia and catheter-related problems. Few articles have evaluated gradual changes of long-term epidural analgesia. In the animal models used in those studies, the catheter was inserted by an invasive surgical procedure. In the present study, we evaluated changes in a canine model in which the catheter was inserted by a minimally invasive procedure. Objectives: To evaluate long-term changes in the efficacy of epidural analgesia in an improved canine model in which the epidural catheter was inserted and fixed for 5 weeks using a minimally invasive procedure. Materials and Methods: Six beagles underwent epidural catheterization under general anaesthesia. The catheter tip was located in the sixth lumbar region; the catheter peripheral end was passed subcutaneously through the neck. Physiological saline was continuously infused (1.0 mL/h) via the catheter throughout the study. The efficacy of epidural analgesia was assessed weekly with 2% lidocaine once a week in 5 weeks. Peripheral blood analysis including interleukin-6 (IL-6) level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), histological evaluations and epidurography were performed to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the changes. Results: No dog died and the catheters were kept in place. The efficacy of analgesia was well maintained until 4 weeks; at 5th week, the efficacy decreased by half. The spread of injected medium was not observed in the cranial direction at 5th week and the tip of catheter was capped with granulation tissue. Throughout the study period, white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels were slightly high for catheterization and the IL-6 level in CSF was below detectable limits. Conclusions: This was the longest study period with continuous epidural analgesia administered in canines. The effective period of epidural anesthesia was 4 weeks in this study. We speculate that time-dependent decrease in the anaesthetic efficacy was attributed to formation of granulation tissue surrounding the catheter tip.",

After puncture, immediately, a skin incision was necessary to fix the mesh subcutaneously. A puncture was made by inserting an epidural needle into the canine epidural space from L7 to S1. This method was confirmed in our pilot study to be a relatively safe and easy epidural catheterization method. To be precise, an 18-gauge Tuohy needle (Epineed; Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the epidural space by the hanging drop method. An epidural catheter was advanced 5 cm through the needle, because approximately 5 cm of indwelling catheter is associated with a lower incidence of protrusion or bending (7,8). The position of catheter was confirmed radiographically with an injection (1.5 mL) of iohexol (Omnipaque 300; Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The tip of the catheter was located in the sixth lumbar (L6) region. The monofilament polypropylene mesh (BardMesh; Bard, Crawley, England, UK) used for reconstruction of tissue defects (9-12) was attached to the catheter near the puncture site with cyanoacrylate adhesive, sutured and secured to the subcutaneous tissue. The peripheral end of the catheter was passed subcutaneously from the puncture site to the neck and connected to a syringe-type disposable infusion pump. Finally, the lumbar skin incision was sutured. The infusion pump was placed in the dog jacket. All dogs received 1.0 mL/h physiologic saline solution via the catheter for 5 weeks.",

Knuckling of the hind limb was the primary experimental parameter for measuring the level and duration of epidural anaesthesia. Knuckling involves motor and sensory nerves and results from proprioceptive impairment of the hind limb. The duration of knuckling of the hind limbs at 4th week was approximately 80% of that observed at the first week; by 5th week, the duration of knuckling decreased to half of that observed at the first week. Thus, anesthetic efficacy did not significantly differ from the fourth week.",

            "text": "Results of CT performed immediately before the catheter was removed, showed no contrast medium at the L5 side of the epidural space. Nagaro (4) reported that the contrast medium spread only to the cephalad side of the catheter tip after long-term catheterization. Differences between their report and the present study are the methods of catheterization and fixation and interval of administration. In their report, the epidural catheter was directly attached with cyanoacrylate adhesive to a hole drilled at a surgically exposed vertebra. The catheterization method that required invasive surgery may have induced inflammation. In our study, the catheter was inserted and fixed with minimal tissue damage and minimal hemorrhage. Furthermore, our study fixation method, fixing the catheter on subcutaneous soft tissue with mesh, can replicate catheter movement in the epidural cavity. In a previous report on epidural anaesthesia in dogs, swalander and colleagues fixed the epidural catheter to the skin with suture and butterfly-patterned adhesive tape and could maintain the catheter at the site for 1.85 days (median 2.0 days) (14). In contrast, the present study secured the catheter tip at the targeted epidural space at 5th week, as confirmed by CT. Mesh reinforcement is thought to be an effective method for securing the position and replicating the catheter movement. Moreover, Nagaro (4) intermittently injected lidocaine daily via epidural catheter. Physiologic saline solution was infused continuously for 5 weeks and lidocaine was injected weekly. The difference in inflammation levels around the catheter tip may have been due to the interval of lidocaine administration. The difference in radiological findings between their report and our study may be due to the amount of inflammation caused by differences in the methods of catheterization and catheter fixation and different administration interval. Tissues around the tip of the catheter were examined at 3 and 5 weeks. Histological evaluation indicated that the catheter tip was capped with fibrotic granulation tissue, which was confirmed by CT. These results suggested that this granulation tissue prevented the contrast medium from spreading over the cephalad and caused leakage of contrast medium from the intervertebral foramen. This similarly suggested that the spread of local anaesthetic administered via the catheter into the epidural space was blocked by granulation tissue. In specimens collected at the 3rd week, there were neutrophils indicative of acute inflammation in the granulation tissue layer. At the 5th week, both acute and chronic inflammation were observed. The formation of granulation tissue is thought to be caused by slight movement of the catheter, foreignbody reaction to the catheter, continuous dosing of saline, chemical stimulation with lidocaine or infection. Furthermore, the specimens of L6 samples collected at the 3rd and 5th weeks suggested that continued inflammation may have led to thickening of the granulation tissue. An inflamed area shows acidic conditions, as demonstrated by a low alkalinity (pH); thus, this widens the gap between the ionization constant (pKa) of lidocaine and the pH of tissue around the catheter. Therefore, the anaesthetic efficacy of lidocaine was reduced. Consequently, we concluded that granulation tissue surrounding the tip of catheter decreased the efficacy of anaesthesia. Suppression of inflammation around the catheter tip to prevent granulation is considered important for successful long-term epidural anesthesia. Previous studies have reported that adding various drugs to the epidural solution can decrease clinical unwanted effects (15)(16)(17). Long-term epidural analgesia requires comparative studies with other drug groups.",

The sampling of vein blood and CSF is minimally invasive and repeatable. WBC and CPR increased 4 days after catheterization, but there was no significant difference. WBC count and CRP level recovered to normal levels within one week. This change may have been attributable to the irritation from subcutaneous passage of the catheter. The CSF reflects an inflammatory response in the subarachnoid space and IL-6 in CSF is one of the important indicators of meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage and spinal cord injury (18)(19)(20)(21)(22). To our knowledge, no report has measured the IL-6 concentration in CSF after long-term epidural catheterization. The unremarkable level of IL-6 in CSF, coupled with lack of signs in any dog with neurological impairments, may suggest the absence of inflammation in the subarachnoid space. Catheterization produced granulation tissue in the epidural space, but it may have been below the level to induce inflammation in the subarachnoid space. The catheterization and fixation method used in this study seems safe and useful for future studies on longterm epidural catheterization. Furthermore, this study may have followed clinical changes more closely than conventional models since the gradual changes were monitored. To our knowledge, this is the longest study period performed regarding continuous epidural anesthesia in dogs.",
