Many drugs act to inhibit autophagic flux by targeting lysosome function, while others were developed to activate the pathway. Here, we report the surprising finding that many therapeutically relevant autophagy modulators with lysosomotropic and ionophore properties, classified as inhibitors of canonical autophagy, are also capable of activating a parallel noncanonical autophagy pathway that drives MAP1LC3/LC3 lipidation on endolysosomal membranes. Further, we provide the first evidence supporting drug-induced noncanonical autophagy in vivo using the local anesthetic lidocaine and human skin biopsies. In addition, we find that several published inducers of autophagy and mitophagy are also potent activators of noncanonical autophagy. Together, our data raise important issues regarding the interpretation of LC3 lipidation data and the use of autophagy modulators, and highlight the need for a greater understanding of the functional consequences of noncanonical autophagy.",

            "text": "The canonical autophagy pathway is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation pathway, through which intracellular proteins and organelles are degraded and recycled. Autophagy plays a major role in cell and organismal homeostasis and autophagic dysfunction contributes to the pathology of many diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. 1 Recent research efforts have focused on the development of drugs to either activate or inhibit the canonical autophagy pathway, with many high-throughput drugs screens having been performed to identify new targets. [2][3][4][5][6] Canonical autophagy can be initiated by various cellular stresses, including nutrient withdrawal. The pathway is orchestrated by multiple proteins including an upstream complex (ULK1/2, RB1CC1/FIP200, ATG13 and ATG101) hereafter referred to as the ULK complex, a class III phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PIK3C3/VPS34) and a ubiquitin-like conjugation system (including ATG3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 16L1). These autophagy proteins act in concert to form compartments termed phagophores that engulf intracellular constituents; completion and maturation into double-membrane autophagosomes allows them to be targeted for degradation. 7 Upon fusion with lysosomes, autophagosomes and their contents are degraded and essential nutrients recycled. As such, the canonical autophagy pathway can be split into 2 stages; first, initiation of autophagosome formation and second, their flux through the lysosome. Autophagosome formation, and therefore autophagy itself, is often measured using the protein MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3). LC3 is a cytosolic ubiquitin-like protein that becomes conjugated to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on forming autophagosomes. Therefore, the appearance of LC3 puncta by microscopy, or the intensity of fastermigrating lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) on SDS-PAGE gels, gives an indication of pathway activity, and are widely used to assay autophagy. Autophagosome number, and levels of lipidated LC3, can differ depending on the point at which the pathway is disrupted. Inhibition of early formation, for instance via inhibition of or depletion of the ULK complex, will reduce autophagosome numbers. Conversely, inhibition of flux, via lysosome inhibition, will accumulate lipidated LC3 on undegraded autophagosomes. 8 It is now well established that autophagy proteins can also target and modify non-autophagosome compartments through a noncanonical pathway. [9][10][11] This noncanonical autophagy pathway mediates the lipidation of LC3 to single-membrane intracellular compartments, including those of the endolysosomal system, following a range of macroendocytic engulfment events. The noncanonical autophagy pathway functions during the physiological process of LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP); [11][12][13][14][15] during which LC3 is lipidated to phagosomes housing a variety of pathogens or dead cells. Similar endolysosomal LC3 lipidation is observed on macropinosomes and during entosis, 9 a live-cell engulfment process. 10 LC3 lipidation in these processes is thought to regulate the fusion of vesicles with lysosomes. In the case of LAP this has important implications regarding the killing and clearance of pathogens, processing of antigens and macrophage cytokine responses following phagocytosis. 11,[14][15][16][17] Mechanisms underlying regulation of the noncanonical pathway are now being explored. Recently, we reported that noncanonical autophagy and endolysosomal LC3 lipidation can be promoted by certain lysosomotropic drugs, such as chloroquine, and the bacterial toxin VacA. 18 Osmotic imbalances generated in endolysosomal compartments by these agents promote the recruitment of some autophagy proteins and lipidation of LC3. Indeed, simply altering extracellular tonicity induces an osmotic flux of water into endolysosomal compartments, which is sufficient to promote noncanonical autophagy. Physiological and drug-induced examples of noncanonical autophagy share the same features of being morphologically and genetically distinct from canonical autophagy. Indeed, noncanonical autophagy and endolysosomal LC3 lipidation proceed in the absence of autophagosomes.",

            "text": "Lysosomes are acidic intracellular compartments where low pH is generated and maintained by the vacuolar-type H C -translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) proton pump and an array of ion channels. 19 We tested the effect of a range of ionophores and lysosomotropic drugs (Table S1) for their effect on lysosomal pH by measuring LysoTracker Red fluorescence in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells. As expected, direct inhibition of V-ATPase activity using bafilomycin A 1 (Baf) raised lysosomal pH and reduced LysoTracker Red staining ( Fig. 1A and 1B). Nigericin (Nig) and monensin (Mon) are ionophores that drive the exchange of potassium and sodium, respectively, for hydrogen ions across membranes. In agreement with published work both nigericin and monensin dissipated lysosome pH ( Fig. 1A  and 1B). 20 Lysosomotropic drugs are basic lipophilic compounds with certain physiochemical properties that promote their accumulation in acidic compartments. 21 Some classic lysosomotropic drugs include chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which are weak base amines used therapeutically as antimalarials and more recently as anticancer drugs. 22 Ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) is another weak base amine lysosomotropic drug. All 3 act to raise lysosome pH by sequestering hydrogen protons ( Fig. 1A and 1B), and are extensively used to inhibit the canonical autophagy flux. Several pharmaceuticals also fall into the lysosomotropic drug category. Lidocaine hydrochloride (LH) and procainamide (ProA) are local anesthetics, also commonly used as antiarrhythmic drugs. Betahistine (BH) is a histamine receptor antagonist with lysosomotropic properties, used in the treatment of vertigo. 23 Lidocaine hydrochloride, procainamide and betahistine all raised lysosomal pH ( Fig. 1A and 1B). Alongside raising lysosomal pH, all of the drugs tested induced extensive formation of vacuoles (vacuolation) in cells. This observation has previously been reported and attributed to osmotic swelling of endolysosomal compartments driven by ionic imbalances or increased solute content of the compartments. 24 These data demonstrate that the panel of commonly used drugs, of different classes, all raise lysosomal pH, and, importantly, achieve this without inhibiting the V-ATPase directly.",

To establish whether this LC3 lipidation was associated with noncanonical autophagy and endolysosomal membranes, we used confocal microscopy to image LC3 localization during drug treatment. Using Atg13 (atg13 \u00a1/\u00a1 ) and Atg9 (atg9 \u00a1/\u00a1 ) knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines, both of which are deficient in autophagosome biogenesis, 26,27 we stained endogenous LC3 and the lysosome marker LAMP1 following drug treatments. In both knockout cell lines, bafilomycin A 1 has no obvious effect, whereas the other drug treatments induce dramatic LC3 relocalization ( Fig. 3 and 4). LC3 was frequently colocalized with enlarged LAMP1 compartments ( Fig. 3 and 4 crops). Similar results have been found in epithelial cells, using a GFP-LC3-expressing MCF10A cell line in which ATG13 has been deleted ( Fig. S1C and S1D and Fig. S3A). These structures are unlikely to be autophagosomes in nature given their large size and the genetic backgrounds of the cell lines used. Corroborating this, there is no detectable increase in the early autophagosome marker WIPI2 following drug treatment ( Fig. S4). Together, these findings indicate that a range of drugs induce LC3 lipidation of endolysosomal compartments distinct from autophagosomes. Interstingly, activation of lipidation did not appear to be restricted to LC3 family members as we also detected relocalization of GFP-GABARAPL2 in atg9 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs upon drug treatment ( Fig. S5).",

            "text": "application of the local anesthetic EMLA before biopsy. EMLA cream is an anesthetic containing the active ingredients lidocaine and prilocaine, and has previously been reported to induce cellular vacuolation of subcutaneous keratinocytes and epithelial cells at the site of application. 30,31 Using ATG13 \u00a1/\u00a1 MCF10A cells, we confirmed that lidocaine can activate noncanonical autophagy by promoting GFP-LC3 recruitment to swollen LAMP1-positive vesicles (Fig. 5A). We next stained control and EMLA-treated skin biopsies for LC3 by immunofluorescence. In agreement with published work, we found the most intense LC3 staining within the stratum granulosum (SG) layer. 32,33 In 5/5 control samples, LC3 staining appeared as a diffusely grainy pattern. However, in 8/11 EMLA-treated samples LC3 localized to larger punctate compartments often observed as ring-like LC3 structures ( Fig. 5B), reminiscent of those seen in lidocaine-treated MCF10A cells. To attempt to determine the identity of these EMLAinduced LC3-positive structures, we stained samples for CDSN (corneodesmosin), a marker for lamellar granules. Lamellar granules are acidic single-membrane lysosome-related organelles found in SG cells, 34,35 and, as such, represent the type of compartment that can be targeted by noncanonical autophagy. Similar to LC3, EMLA treatment promoted a swelling of CDSNpositive structures (Fig. 5C). By costaining samples for LC3 and CDSN, we observed LC3 staining on some enlarged CDSN-positive structures following EMLA treatment (Fig. 5D). Finally, using transmission electron microscopy, we detected enlarged single-membrane compartments in EMLA-treated samples (Fig. 5E). Together these data support the idea that EMLA application promotes LC3 lipidation to non-autophagosome membranes, likely to represent lamellar granules in skin epidermal cells. These data are the first to propose that lysosomotropic drug-induced noncanonical autophagy and endolysosomal LC3 lipidation can be induced in vivo. This raises important questions regarding the consequences following activation of this pathway in vivo, which need to be addressed in the future.",

            "text": "Considering our data using inhibitors of canonical autophagy flux, we next sought to test whether published activators of canonical autophagy have any effect on the noncanonical pathway. CCCP is a proton uncoupler that acts as an ionophore for hydrogen. 36 Treatment of cells with CCCP promotes mitochondrial dysfunction by dissipating proton gradients between inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. The E3 ubiquitin ligase PARK2/parkin is then recruited and regulates the engulfment and degradation of damaged mitochondria through a selective autophagic process termed mitophagy. 37 Previously, LC3 lipidation observed following CCCP treatment has been attributed to ATG13-dependent autophagosome formation during mitophagy or bulk autophagy. 38,39 However, in addition to eliminating proton gradients at mitochondria, CCCP will also dissipate proton gradients at lysosomes. 40 In light of our results using the ionophores nigericin and monensin, we questioned whether CCCP could induce noncanonical autophagy and endolysosomal LC3 lipidation. We found that CCCP induced LC3 lipidation in a dose-dependent manner in both wild-type and ATG13 \u00a1/\u00a1 HEK293 cells, which could be inhibited by bafilomycin A 1 pretreatment ( Fig. 6A and 6B). Entotic corpse vacuoles are single-membrane acidic compartments formed following the live engulfment and killing of epithelial cells by the process entosis. These vacuoles represent the type of compartment that can be targeted by noncanonical autophagy. 9,18 Using confocal microscopy we observed that CCCP promoted the robust recruitment of GFP-LC3 to LAMP1-positive entotic corpse vacuoles in wild-type and ATG13 \u00a1/\u00a1 MCF10A cells, in a bafilomycin A 1 -sensitive manner (Fig. 6C and 6B and Fig. S4B). We also noted a strong colocalization of GFP-LC3 with LAMP1-positive lysosomes upon CCCP treatment, which was resistant to a PIK3C3/VPS34 inhibitor (IN-1) able to inhibit starvation-induced GFP-LC3 puncta (Fig. 6E). Taken together, the ATG13-and PIK3C3/VPS34-independent lipidation of LC3 to non-autophagosome membranes clearly demonstrates that CCCP can activate noncanonical autophagy. CCCP did induce WIPI2 puncta in wild-type but not atg13 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs suggesting some activation of canonical autophagy (Fig. 6F). Bafilomycin A 1 inhibited CCCP-induced LC3 lipidation ( Fig. 6B and 6D) but not CCCP-mediated mitochondria depolarization and fragmentation (Fig. 6G). Thus, CCCP's ability to activate noncanonical autophagy is separate to its ability to promote mitochondria dysfunction. These data strengthen the conclusion that while CCCP does induce mitophagy, it is also a potent inducer of endolysosomal LC3 lipidation in parallel. ",

This in turn activates autophagy, potentially through an MTOR-independent pathway. 42 However, amiodarone also has lysosomotropic properties, accumulating in lysosomes and inducing their osmotic swelling. 43 Considering our new data, we investigated whether noncanonical autophagy participates in amiodarone-induced LC3 lipidation.",

We also noted swelling of intracellular LAMP1-positive vacuoles. Using wild-type and ATG13 \u00a1/\u00a1 HEK293 cells we found that amiodarone could induce a dosedependent induction of LC3 lipidation in both cell lines by western blotting, which was inhibited by bafilomycin A 1 pretreatment. (Fig. 7A-C). By immunofluorescence staining of endogenous LC3 we found that amiodarone could promote the relocalization of LC3 to swollen LAMP1 compartments in autophagy-deficient atg13 \u00a1/\u00a1 and atg9 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs (Fig. 7D). Amiodarone-induced GFP-LC3 relocalization was not inhibited by a PIK3C3/VPS34 inhibitor (Fig. 7E). These data provide clear and strong evidence that amiodarone can activate noncanonical autophagy. However, as with CCCP, we do detect amiodarone-induced WIPI2 puncta in wild-type, but not in atg9 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs, indicating that amiodarone induces both canonical and noncanonical autophagy in parallel (Fig. 7F).",

Increased LC3 lipidation by these drugs has previously been attributed to inhibition of canonical autophagic flux or promotion of autophagosome formation (Table S1). However, our data clearly shows that these drugs can also induce LC3 lipidation in the absence of ATG13 and ATG9 or PIK3C3/VPS34 activity, all of which are required for autophagosome formation. It is highly unlikely that the observed LC3 lipidation is a result of alternative routes of autophagosome formation, such as BECN1/Beclin 1-or ULK1/2independent pathways, as these mechanisms still require some autophagy machinery not necessary for the described noncanonical pathway. Instead our data indicate that LC3 is lipidated directly onto non-autophagosome membranes associated with the endolysosomal system.",

In human skin biopsy samples where the anesthetic cream EMLA containing lidocaine had been applied topically, we observed swollen LC3-positive vesicles in epidermal cells of the stratum granulosum layer, which bear markers of lamellar granules, lysosome-like organelles in skin. While we cannot exclude a role for canonical autophagy in these human samples, the single-membrane, low pH nature of the lamellar granules represents the characteristic type of compartment targeted by noncanonical autophagy. Indeed EMLA has previously been shown to induce vacuolation of singlemembrane structures based on electron microscopy. 30 We also report that CCCP, commonly used to induce mitophagy, can activate noncanonical autophagy in parallel. Interestingly, one study reported CCCP-induced LC3 lipidation occurring in the absence of RB1CC1/FIP200, ATG13 and ATG14; however, the authors did not determine what this lipidated LC3 represented. 44 We now demonstrate that CCCP can promote LC3 lipidation to endolysosomal membranes completely independent from canonical autophagy. This is achieved at higher concentrations than those reported to induce mitophagy, but are still within levels commonly used in the study of autophagy. The requirement for higher concentrations may reflect the differences in sensitivity between mitochondria and lysosomes to proton permeability.",

Considering that all of the drugs tested in our study have previously been shown to induce an osmotically driven swelling of single-membrane endolysosomal compartments, and our new data show that drug-induced LC3 lipidation is suppressed by inhibitors of the V-ATPase, we conclude that the same mechanism activating noncanonical autophagy is functional.",

Many genetic and pharmaceutical based high-throughput screens for autophagy modulators have been conducted with LC3 lipidation or puncta formation used as the readout. It should now be appreciated that LC3 is not a specific autophagosome marker and can be lipidated to non-autophagosome membranes. While not applicable to all known autophagy modulators, our results show that many drugs used to modulate the canonical autophagy pathway, primarily with lysosomotropic or ionophore properties, can also act as potent inducers of noncanonical autophagy and endolysosomal LC3 lipidation. This finding is an important consideration in the design and interpretation of future autophagy screens. Related to this, tandem RFP-GFP-LC3 constructs are now commonly used to measure autophagosome flux, whereby an increased dual signal is assumed to reflect a block in autophagosomelysosome fusion. However, considering that LC3 associated with endolysosomal membranes will also retain both RFP and GFP signals, our findings on noncanonical autophagy further complicate the interpretation of such results. Therefore, we would recommend that in addition to assays measuring LC3 lipidation, autophagy screens should include other markers associated with autophagosome formation, such as autophagosome-associated phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate effectors ZFYVE1/DFCP1 and WIPI2, to infer an effect on canonical autophagy induction. Similarly, measurement of autophagosome receptors such as SQSTM1/p62 or protein aggregates would give an accompanying indication on the degradation capacity of the autophagy pathway.",

LC3 present on autophagosomes and endosomes have recently been shown to modulate MAPK/ERK signaling, enabling these compartments to act as a signaling platform. 49,50 Whether noncanonical autophagy could generate similar endolysosomal signaling hubs would be of great interest and possibly inform on the efficacy and function of some autophagymodulating drugs that possess endolysosomal LC3 lipidation properties.",
