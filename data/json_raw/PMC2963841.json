There is no comprehensive instrument to study these issues in India. This study reports on development and standardization of a new instrument to fill this lacuna. Family Interview for Stress and Coping in Mental Retardation (FISC-MR), a semi-structured interview schedule, was developed as a part of two years prospective study of efficacy of brief family intervention for 157 children with mental retardation (funded by ICMR). The tool consists of 2 sections-one measuring stress (daily care, emotional, social and financial) and the other measuring mediators of stress or coping strategies (awareness, attitudes, expectations, rearing practices and social support). Results indicate moderate to high reliability (internal consistency, inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability) and validity (factorial, criterion and construct) of the instrument. It is concluded that FISC-MR is a useful, reliable and valid instrument for both clinical and research purposes.",

These are (i) child specific variables such as age, sex and severity of retardation, (ii) socio-demographic variables such as social class, family income and domicile and (iii) family coping resources and strategies. It is interesting to note that studies have consistently shown that coping by the families has a more decisive effect on the stress experienced by them than the other 2 sets of variables (Byrne & Cunningham, 1985;Beresford,1994). Though it is clear that coping plays a key role in family adaptation, it has been a difficult research question to study. Several theoretical models have been utilised for examining this intricate process of family stress, coping and adaptation, such as the stress and coping theory of Folkman & Lazarus (1984), the ABCX model of McCubbin (Orr et al.,1991) and eco-cultural model (Gallimore et al.,1993).",

For instance, in their review, Gallagher and colleagues (1983) identified the following as important mediator variables (or coping strategies) which influence the stress felt by the families: expectations, attributions, parents' view of the causation of the handicap, nature and quality of daily interactions with the child, parents' notions about their own efficacy as 'change agents' in facilitating child's development, attitudes and social support. Other such mediating factors which have been identified include family beliefs and perceptions, religious and moral beliefs, overall philosophies and ideologies held by the families, family lifestyles and extent of harmony in the family (Byrne & Cunningham,1985;Beresford,1994). The role of these issues in the family focussed intervention in mental retardation is evidently of crucial importance and has been reviewed elsewhere (Cunningham, 1985;Davis & Rushton, 1991;Girimaji,1993;Beresford,1994).",

The focus of these methods has varied and included areas such as mothers' well-being, marital adjustment among parents, stress of parenting, parental attitudes, care-taking demands, perceptions and expectations. However, there is no one standardized instrument to study the variety of stresses experienced by the families and coping strategies available to them. Such an instrument is required not only for research purposes but also to facilitate family focussed intervention. Keeping this lacuna in mind, the authors developed a new instrument to evaluate stress and its mediators in the families of children with mental retardation. This work was carried out as a part of the initial preparation for two years prospective study funded by Indian Council of Medical Research, titled \"a study of the evaluation of the effectiveness of brief inpatient family intervention versus outpatient intervention for mentally retarded children'. For this study, stress was defined as those aspects of the family's response to its member with mental retardation that are experienced as distressful. Mediators of stress, or coping strategies were defined as those aspects of family's beliefs, attributions, expectations, resources and practices that are likely to influence the stress experienced by the family. These definitions were adapted along the lines suggested by Galfagheret al.(1983).",

Accordingly, FISC-MR has 2 major Sections : Section-I is meant for elicitation of perceived stress in different area and Section-ll for exploration of certain mediating factors or coping strategies. The structure of these two Section is laid out in table 1. In short, Section-I has 4 areas and a total of 11 sub-scales, whereas Section-ll has 5 areas and a total of 9 sub-scales. A four or five point rating scale with scoring instructions are provided for each sub-scale. The sub-scales on stress are rated on a 5 point scale (no or minimal stress to very high level) and those in the Section-ll are rated on a 4 point scale (most favourable to most unfavourable). Table 2 and  3 give details of the scoring patterns for Section I and II respectively. The approximate time required for the administration of the instrument was around 45 minutes.",

Interrater reliability of 3 raters for 9 families was computed. The intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) for any single rater was 0.81 and average reliability for all 3 raters was 0.93, indicating good inter-rater reliability. Test-retest reliability was calculated for a sub-sample of families who were evaluated at intake and again after a mean duration of 4.5 months (N=110). Pearson's Yfor Section-I was 0.71 (p<.01) and for Section-ll was 0.36 (p<.01), indicating moderate to high testretest reliability.",

A principal components analysis with varimax rotation followed by factor extraction with eigen values more than 1 was carried out separately for Section-I and Section-ll. All the sub-scales (11 for Section-I and 9 for Section-ll) were included for factor analysis. Section-I yielded two factors. On inspection of the loading, factor 1 has been labelled as socio-emotional stress and factor 2 as stress of daily care demand. Similarly, Se'ction-ll yielded 3 factors and have been named as awareness/expectations, attitudes/ rearing practices and social support respectively. The loading of sub-scales on these factors have been given in table 5. Criterion Validity : Since FISC MR is a newly developed instrument, it was decided to concurrently evaluate all the families with another well established instrument. For this purpose, Questionnaire on Resources and Stress -Short Form (QRS-SF) developed by Friedrich and his colleagues (Friedrich et al.,1983) and widely used in USA was chosen. This is a self-report Questionnaire of family stress completed by a key family member and has 52 items. The criterion or concurrent validity, as measured as Pearson's Y between Section-I and QRS-SF score for 157 families at intake was 0.63 (p<.01), indicating moderate criterion or concurrent validity. Construct Validity : It was hypothesized that measure of stress (total score on Section-I) should correlate with measure of mediators (total score on Section-ll), which was indeed so, Pearson's Y between-Section-I total score and Section-ll total score was found to be 0.51, (p<.001), indicating a moderate degree of evidence for construct validity.",

The coefficients of measures of reliability were between 0.36 to 0.9. Some loss of association may have occurred in test-retest reliability due to the possibility of intervention acting as a confounding variable. The coefficients of validity measures were between 0.51 and 0.63, indicating a reasonable degree of validity. In the factorial study, though there was some overlap of items between the factors, the overall factor loading of items revealed meaningful factors. The emergence of two factors in the Section-I viz., emotional/social and stress of care demand, is in keeping with the findings reported by others (Crnic et al.,1983;Friedrich et al.,1983). Section 2 yielded 3 factors as already mentioned, with sub-scales of awareness and expectations hanging together in the first factor, those of attitudes and rearing practices coming together in the second and social support and global adaptation in the third. These findings shed some light on the process of coping and adaptation in these families. It is also worthwhile to note that total score on Section-ll (signifying the extent of coping in the families), correlated significantly with total score on Section-I (signifying the extent of stress in the families), indicating the importance of coping as a determinant of perceived stress in the families. Further refinement of the instrument based on the results of the factor analysis was not attempted in this study. However, it is worth noting that all the sub-scales loaded significantly on one or other factor, indicating that none of the sub-scales were redundant.",

So, the instrument, to our mind, can not only serve for research purposes but also for planning management.
