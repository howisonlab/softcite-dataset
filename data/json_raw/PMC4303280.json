In addition, there are an increasing number of reports that the endplate degeneration influences the lumbar spinal fusion. The object of this retrospective controlled study was to evaluate how the endplate degeneration and the bisphosphonate medication influence the spinal fusion through radiographic evaluation. Methods: In this study, 44 patients who underwent single-level posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using cage were examined from April 2007 to March 2009. All patients had been diagnosed as osteoporosis and would be recommended for alendronate medication. Endplate degeneration is categorized by the Modic changes. The solid fusion is defined if there was bridging bone between the vertebral bodies, either within or external to the cage on the plain X-ray and if there is less than 5\u00b0 of angular difference in dynamic X-ray. Results: In alendronate group, fusion was achieved in 66.7% compared to 73.9% in control group (no medication). Alendronate did not influence the fusion rate of PLIF. However, there was the statistical difference of fusion rate between the endplate degeneration group and the group without endplate degeneration. A total of 52.4% of fusion rate was seen in the endplate degeneration group compared to 91.3% in the group without endplate degeneration. The endplate degeneration suppresses the fusion process of PLIF. Conclusion: Alendronate does not influence the fusion process in osteoporotic patients. The endplate degeneration decreases the fusion rate.",

            "text": "Alendronate medication has been the standard treatment for patients with osteoporosis 2,24) . Alendronate binds to resorption surfaces of the bone and is locally released during acidification, and the rise in concentration stops resorption and membrane ruffling without destroying the osteoclasts 23) . Alendronate altered the density distributions, thereby decreasing the area with a high fracture risk, resulting in increased vertebral strength 7) . Despite these good effects on treating osteoporosis, using alend-ronate after spinal fusion is the controversial issue due to the inhibition of osteoclast mediated bone resorption. Many in vitro studies show the negative effect of alendronate to the lumbar spinal interbody fusion 6,9,13) . However, recent prospective randomized control studies showed that alendronate overcame its detrimental biological effect on the healing process of spinal fusion 18. The endplate degeneration of the lumbar spine has been thought as the source of back pain, but it also influenced the lumbar spinal fusion 12) . Signal intensity changes of vertebral endplates and subchondral bone are often observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with spinal degenerative diseases. In 1988, Modic et al. 16,17) summarized these changes and classified them into three types, and then Modic changes (MC), as a medical term, were used in the studies on spinal degenerative diseases. Although the etiology of MC remains poorly understood, some progress has been achieved in basic research during the past two decades, including studies of the prevalence and some clinical significance.",

Effects of spinal biomechanics are hard to quantify, whereas the bone quality can be easily measured by using bone densitometry and differentiated by using MRI according to Modic 16,17) . Most of spine surgeons believe that osteoporosisrelated bone fragility is the primary reason for implant fixation failure 11) , and it leads to fusion Failure 4,14) . Both osteoporosis and MC related spinal fusion rate has been known to be low compared to normal or osteopenic patients 12,18) . The only available human study shows osteoporosis and alendronate influence the spinal fusion rate 18) . This study demonstrates a solid fusion was achieved in 95% of patients in the alendronate group, and 65% of those in the control group 18) . Most animal studies 1,3,5,13,19,21,[26][27][28][29] evaluating the impact of bisphosphonates on fusion rate have not found statistically significant changes with treatment, although this fact may be attributable to low statistical power. The animal literature does suggest that bisphosphonate therapy results in a less histologically mature fusion mass; however, the impact of these changes on fusion mass biomechanics is unclear. There are many studies about the endplate degeneration correlating with the symptoms, but few studies report a correlation between MC and spinal fusion. Kwon 12) shows that the bony fusion rate was 97% in patients without degeneration and 83% in patients with MC. The bony fusion rate in each group was 81% in type 1, 84% in type 2, and 55% in type 3. The clinical success and fusion rates were significantly lower in patients with type 3 degeneration 12) . Generally accepted fusion rate of lumbar spine is around 85-95% 10) . In our study, the overall fusion rate was 75%. Since half of the patients had MC in lumbar spine endplate, which could lower the fusion rate, fusion rate of our study could be acceptable.",

There was the statistical difference of fusion rate between the endplate degeneration group and the group without endplate degeneration. Endplate degeneration had potential to decrease the lumbar interbody fusion. We also compared the fusion rate of endplate degeneration by MC. There was no statistical difference of fusion rate between MC. The degeneration itself influenced the fusion rate, but there was no difference between fusion rates of the MC subtypes. Small sample size and surgical technique might influence the outcome. Most of the spinal surgeons use endplate decortications technique, a process of making microfracture of fusion bed, during lumbar interbody fusion. This process would eliminate the cortical bone and sclerotic endplate degeneration, such as MC type 3, to making bone marrow surface in fusion bed. However, endplate degeneration seems to influence the biological environment for those osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The limitation of this result is that the thickness of sclerotic endplate had not been measured. The thicker at the endplate sclerosis, the harder to make good fusion bed.",

(2) Could the current findings in a single-level posterior lumbar interbody fusion be applied to other situations, including multi-level spinal fusion, or correction of spinal deformities? (3) How will different types of spinal fusion, especially posterolateral lumbar fusion, affect the fusion process under alendronate medication? (4) Does bridging bone under alendronate treatment have sufficient mechanical properties and bone quality?",
