The database delivers a unified query interface and API to query sample information across EBI's databases and provides links back to assay databases. Sample groups are used to manage related samples, e.g. those from an experimental submission, or a single reference collection. Infrastructural improvements include a new user interface with ontological and key word queries, a new query API, a new data submission API, complete RDF data download and a supporting SPARQL endpoint, accessioning at the point of submission to the European Nucleotide Archive and European Genotype Phenotype Archives and improved query response times.",

            "text": "The EBI's BioSamples database provides a single point of entry to sample data stored in EBI assay databases and delivers a dedicated query interface and API for accessing sample data. Samples are arranged into sample groups for ease of query, submission and to allow attributes to be added at the group level rather than at the sample specific level. This supports cases where values or attributes must be expressed as binned values across samples. This happens when the information is not available or cannot be provided at the sample level for ethical reasons (1). When querying BioSamples users are offered links to assay databases, for example, to sequence information in the European Nucleotide Archive or ENA (2), gene expression microarrays in ArrayExpress (3) or proteomics data PRoteomics IDEntifications database or PRIDE (4). The EBI's BioSamples database is developed in parallel with the NBCI's BioSamples database (5), which fulfils a similar function at the NCBI. This article describes data growth and new features implemented since our previous publication in 2011 (6).",

The core attributes list will be used to facilitate data exchange, provide improved searches across attributes and drive context specific displays to ensure like attributes are displayed together for specific experiment types, e.g. latitude, longitude and depth for ocean samples.
