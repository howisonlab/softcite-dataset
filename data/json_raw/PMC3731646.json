Nevertheless, the good performance of exhaust gas purification catalysts often requires the high consumption of noble metals such as platinum. Here we report that the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites on the external surface of a microporous silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) act as a promoter for exhaust gas purification, effectively cutting the loading amount of platinum in the catalyst without sacrifice of performance. It is revealed that in the Pt-loaded SAPO-CHA catalyst, there exists a remarkable synergistic effect between the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites and the Pt nanoparticles, the former helping to adsorb and activate the hydrocarbon molecules for NO reduction during the catalytic process. The thermal stability of SAPO-CHA also makes the composite catalyst stable and reusable without activity decay.",

Platinum-containing catalysts have attracted increasing attention in the past decades because of their superior activity as a catalyst not only for redox reactions but also for purification of automobile exhaust gases [1][2][3][4][5] . Many researches have been focused on the development of Pt-loaded catalysts that are desired to effectively eliminate the emission of harmful gases under practical operation conditions 4 . Despite great efforts to date with significant successes, the good performance of catalysts usually leads to high consumption of expensive noble metals, and recovery of noble metals from spent catalysts is required. In general, the performance of a catalyst is also heavily dependent on the physical and chemical properties of its support, which should possess not only a considerable surface area to sustain a uniform dispersion of noble metals, but also strong interaction with the metals to promote the redox reactions 6 . In this context, the selection of suitable supports is very critical in determining the performance and the cost of Pt-containing catalysts for purifying emission gases.",

            "text": "To optimize catalyst supports for stabilizing Pt nanoparticles, materials that allow access to activating substrates and/or elevating the activity of Pt nanoparticles are preferred. Microporous crystalline silicoaluminophosphates (SAPOs) are an important class of molecular sieve materials which have been widely used in adsorption, separation and catalysis. Among the SAPOs, chabazite-type SAPO (SAPO-CHA) 7 with small pores and fairly strong Br\u00f8nsted acidity has shown excellent catalytic activity and shape selectivity in methanol-to-olefin (MTO) conversion [8][9][10] and HC transformation [11][12][13] . It is thus rather promising to integrate the catalytic activity of SAPO-CHA with rich Br\u00f8nsted acid sites and Pt nanoparticles for efficient removal of automobile exhaust gases, which also contain HCs, under even mild conditions. Although previous studies have used SAPO-CHA containing metal cations for removal of NO x through a selective-catalytic-reduction (SCR) pathway [14][15][16] , the exploitation of rich Br\u00f8nsted acid sites in SAPO-CHA support for activating noble metal nanoparticles to simultaneously purify the major pollutants CO, NO x and HC of a gasoline engine emission has not been described yet. In this report, we demonstrate the remarkable promotion effect of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites of SAPO-CHA on the catalytic performance of supported Pt catalyst for purification of automobile exhaust gases. Accordingly, the catalyst cost may be reduced markedly by decreasing the Pt-loading amount on the SAPO-CHA material without sacrifice of catalytic performance.",

Pt nanoparticles were loaded on the surface of AlPO-CHA and SAPO-CHA through an impregnation approach, and the resulting materials are designated as Pt/AlPO-CHA and Pt/SAPO-CHA, respectively. For comparison, a Pt-loaded alumina material (Pt/Al 2 O 3 ) was also prepared similarly and used as a reference. Pt nanoparticles were mainly dispersed on the external surface of the molecular sieves as the size of Pt nanoparticles observed in the TEM image ( Figure S2) is much larger that the pore size of the molecular sieves.",

            "text": "Distribution of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. The distribution of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites was initially investigated by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements ( Fig. 1a), where NH 3 and pyridine were used as the probe molecules. The NH 3 -TPD profiles with two strong desorption peaks at temperatures of 680 and 850 K reveal a rich amount of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites on the surface of SAPO-CHA based materials and also the Br\u00f8nsted-acid-free nature of AlPO-CHA materials (Figure 1a). This observation has been doubly confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of dehydrated SAPO-CHA with strong absorptions at 3630 and 3600 cm 21 (Fig. S3). Pyridine molecules with a large dynamic diameter (0.65 nm) cannot diffuse into the micropores (window size 0.43 nm) of SAPO-CHA, and were thus used as probe molecules to characterize the acidity of the external surfaces of SAPO-CHA. The strong signal at 1540 cm 21 , arising from protonated pyridinium cations, in the FTIR spectrum ( Fig. 1b)  . For conventional Pt-containing catalysts (e.g. Pt/Al 2 O 3 ), a pre-activation process to reduce the PtO 2 component to metallic Pt has to be conducted at an elevated temperature before practical use and/or reuse, resulting in additional cost due to the consumption of H 2 gas and electric energy. The stability of the metallic Pt should also be seriously considered in designing new sustainable catalysts. Both the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra ( Figure  S4) and Fourier transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Figure 1c) of the Pt species dispersed on SAPO-CHA and AlPO-CHA are similar to those of Pt foil, rather speaking for the formation of metallic Pt nanoparticles. As described previously, the Pt species on Al 2 O 3 exist mainly as Pt oxide 21,22 . The representative schematic illustrations for the Pt species dispersed on different supports are shown in the inset of Fig. 1c. It can be envisaged that the nature of the support gives a significant impact on the state of Pt species generated on the support. No obvious reduction peaks were observed for Pt/SAPO-CHA and Pt/AlPO-CHA materials in the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments ( Fig. S5), and this is to say that the hightemperature activation process in H 2 is not essential for Pt/SAPO-CHA catalyst. It is thus quite convenient for Pt/SAPO-CHA to be directly used in purification of automobile exhaust gases.",

The conversions of exhaust gases (NO, CO and C 3 H 6 ) over Pt/SAPO-CHA and control catalysts were monitored at gradually increased reaction temperatures. Previously, C 3 H 6 has been widely applied as a typical model of HCs to evaluate the catalytic performance of catalysts in purification of automobile exhaust gases, and it was thus used in this work accordingly. As shown in Figure 2, the conversions of C 3 H 6 , NO and CO over Pt/ SAPO-CHA are all higher than those of Pt/AlPO-CHA and Pt/Al 2 O 3 with the same Pt-loading content (0.5 wt%). The temperature at a conversion of 50% of C 3 H 6 over Pt/SAPO-CHA is 549 K, nearly 100 and 50 K lower than that over Pt/Al 2 O 3 and Pt/AlPO-CHA respectively (Fig. 2), while the temperature at a conversion of 90% of C 3 H 6 is about 578 K for Pt/SAPO-CHA, also much lower than those of Pt/AlPO-CHA (630 K) and Pt/Al 2 O 3 (655 K). Moreover, bare SAPO-CHA as the catalyst gave no conversion of C 3 H 6 , NO and CO, suggesting that only Pt particles acted as the active cites for such a catalytic reaction. The turnover frequencies (TOF) over Pt/SAPO-CHA were calculated to be 0.014, 0.019 and 0.217 s 21 respectively for C 3 H 6 , NO and CO at a temperature of 575 K. These TOF values are distinctly higher than those of all the other catalysts (including the Pt/Al 2 O 3 -aging material) used in this work, and than those of Pt-, Pd-, or Rh-NPs based catalysts reported in the literature under similar conditions (Table S1)  [23][24][25][26][27] . Furthermore, products of NO conversion have been identified through gas chromatograph (GC) and gas-phase FTIR measurements. As shown in Figure S6, typical IR bands of N 2 O gas at 2212 and 2235 cm 21 were detected in the spectra of products catalyzed over Pt/AlPO-CHA and Pt/Al 2 O 3 , showing the moderate selectivity of these catalysts. The fact that the peaks of N 2 O gas were not present in the spectra of purified gases over Pt/SAPO-CHA reveals the high selectivity of this catalyst in the purification of exhausting gases, again speaking for the advantage of SAPO-CHA as the catalyst support here.",

            "text": "To find out how the Br\u00f8nsted acid affects the catalytic activity, it is essential to understand the nature of the acid sites in the SAPO-CHA molecular sieve. Individual Br\u00f8nsted acid site is a hydroxyl proton located at bridging oxygen between tetrahedrally coordinated silicon and aluminum atoms (Figure 3b). Previous studies indicated that adsorption of olefins (e.g. C 3 H 6 here) on Br\u00f8nsted acid sites tend to be transformed to alkoxy species with a carbeniumion-like feature, which can undergo further reactions to become other derivative products in various task-specific catalytic reactions [28][29][30] . We thus calculated the structure of the SAPO-CHA using relativistic density functional theory (DFT) to elucidate the function of Br\u00f8nsted acid in the catalytic transformation of C 3 H 6 . The simulation results suggest a very high electron density around the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites (Fig. 3b), which facilitates the adsorption and activation of C 3 H 6 molecules for conversion into covalent alkoxy species in the catalytic reactions 31 . Moreover, the high electron density of the Pt nanoparticles will also be enhanced once Pt nanoparticles form a contact at the electronrich surface of SAPO-CHA, promising a possibility to improve the catalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles. The facts that the bare SAPO-CHA with rich Br\u00f8nsted acid sites offered no obvious activity for purifying exhaust gases ( Figure S7) and gave much better catalytic performance as catalyst support than that of Br\u00f8nsted-acid-site-free AlPO-CHA reveals an obvious synergistic effect between the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites and the Pt nanoparticles. Such a synergistic effect facilitates conversion of C 3 H 6 and NO gases via simultaneously lowering the energy barrier of the oxidation reaction of HCs and enhancing the activity of Pt nanoparticles (Fig. 3c, Supplementary  Movie S1).",

The structure and crystallinity of SAPO-CHA remains unchanged after reaction as confirmed by the FTIR (Fig. S9) and XRD (Fig. S10) analysis. As conventional catalysts for hydrogen transformation, zeolitic catalysts, including SAPO-CHA here, generally suffer from deactivation induced by the formation of coke inside the micropores. As expected, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) result reveals formation of coke (20 wt%) in the used Pt/ SAPO-CHA catalyst (Fig. S11). Nevertheless, the conversions of CO, NO and C 3 H 6 over Pt/SAPO-CHA at a space velocity of 34,000 mL gcat 21 h 21 , do not show any obvious decay over a 1,000-minute run at 620 K (in Fig. S12), suggesting that the coke formed during the catalytic reaction has no influence on activity of the Pt/SAPO-CHA catalyst. The NH 3 -TPD ( Fig. S13) and pyridine-TPD ( Fig. S14) results suggest that coke forms only inside the micropores of SAPO-CHA and the amount of the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites on the external surface is not varied. This observation well explains why the formation of coke leads to negligible deactivation as the Pt nanoparticles are mostly distributed on the external surface of the Pt/SAPO-CHA catalyst. On the other hand, it is exactly the Pt nanoparticles that catalyzes the complete transformation of propene to CO 2 and H 2 O with concomitant NO reduction, and prevents the formation of coke on the external surface of the SAPO-CHA material.",
