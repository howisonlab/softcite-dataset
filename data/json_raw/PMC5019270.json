            "text": "During the past several decades, resistance to single or multiple anticancer agents has posed a great challenge in cancer therapy. Dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (DOCK1), the first identified member in DOCK family, plays diverse roles in cellular processes, including tumorigenesis. In this study, we explored the biological role of DOCK1 in the chemotherapeutic resistance in bladder cancer and its underlying mechanism. Our results showed that the bladder cancer cell lines UM-UC-3 and J82 with higher DOCK1 are more resistant to cisplatin, whereas B87 cells with the lowest expression of DOCK1 exhibited the highest sensitivity to cisplatin. Downregulation of DOCK1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased the cisplatin sensitivity in bladder cancer cells. Moreover, treatment with cisplatin induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while transfection with Twist siRNA restored the chemosensitivity to cisplatin. In addition, we found that downregulation of DOCK1 reversed EMT program in bladder cancer cells. However, cotransfection with DOCK1 siRNA could not further enhance the cisplatin sensitivity and cellular phenotypic changes in tumor cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that downregulation of DOCK1 could increase the chemosensitivity in bladder cancer cells via preventing cisplatin-induced EMT, suggesting that DOCK1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in bladder cancer.",

            "text": "Bladder cancer is the most common urinary tract malignancy and remains one of the costliest diseases to manage from diagnosis to death. 1 In accordance with the invasion degree, patients with bladder cancer can be diagnosed as nonmuscle-invasive or muscleinvasive tumor. 2 In addition to the radical cystectomy, cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy serves as an important therapy option and shows increased response rate and prolonged survival in patients with bladder cancer. 3 However, cisplatin resistance in the past several decades has become a great challenge for clinical treatment of bladder cancer, highlighting the urgency to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the drug resistance. 4 The dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK) family with eleven mammalian members belongs to the atypical Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Emerging evidences reported the critical roles of DOCK in various cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion and migration. 5,6 As the first identified member of DOCK protein family, DOCK1 plays crucial roles in cytoskeletal organization, myoblast fusion, and phagocytosis via Rac1 activation in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila.

[12][13][14] However, the biological function of DOCK1 in bladder cancer has not been investigated. Thus, this study aimed to explore the role of DOCK1 in the chemotherapeutic resistance in bladder cancer and its underlying mechanism.",

Western blot analysis revealed that cisplatin treatment promoted the expression of DOCK1 in UM-UC-3, J82, and B87 cells ( Figure 5A). However, cisplatin addition failed to induce EMT in DOCK1-knockdown cells ( Figure 5B), suggesting that EMT induction by cisplatin was dependent on DOCK1 in bladder cancer cells. To further elucidate the effects of DOCK1-regulated EMT on cisplatin sensitivity, bladder cancer cells were transfected with Twist siRNA alone or in combination with DOCK1 siRNA. CCK-8 assay showed that DOCK1 inhibition could not further sensitize tumor cells to cisplatin after transfection with Twist siRNA (Figure 6A-C). On the molecular level, Western blot analysis showed that Twist knockdown led to a reduction of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in bladder cancer cells. However, cotransfection with DOCK1 siRNA had no obvious effects on the expression of cellular phenotype markers in Twist siRNA-transfected bladder cancer cells ( Figure 6D). Taken together, these results confirmed that downregulation of DOCK1 sensitized bladder cancer cells to cisplatin via regulation of EMT.",
