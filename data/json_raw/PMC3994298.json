However, the pain-relieving effects of acupuncture may be different depending on acupoints. In the present study, the effects of acupuncture on behavioral responses and c-Fos expression were evaluated using a formalin test in male Sprague-Dawley rats in order to clarify the analgesic effects of three different acupoints. Each rat received manual acupuncture at the ST36 (Zusanli), SP9 (Yinlingquan) or BL60 (Kunlun) acupoint before formalin injection. Flinching and licking behaviors were counted by two blinded investigators. Fos-like immunoreactivity was examined by immunohistochemistry in the rat spinal cord. Manual acupuncture treatment at BL60 acupoint showed significant inhibition in flinching behavior but not in licking. Manual acupuncture at ST36 or SP9 tended to inhibit flinching and licking behaviors but the effects were not statistically significant. The acupuncture at ST36, SP9, or BL60 reduced c-Fos expression as compared with the control group. These results suggest that acupuncture especially at the BL60 acupoint is more effective in relieving inflammatory pain than other acupoints.",

            "text": "Acupuncture, which has a 3,000-year-old history, is the process of stimulating skin regions called meridians or acupoints [1] and has been used to treat pain-related symptoms caused by diseases such as rheumatic arthritis and osteoarthritis [2,3]. Although acupuncture was originated from Oriental countries, the pain-relieving effect of acupuncture stimulation has been widely recognized. As a result, acupuncture became one of the complementary and alternative medicinal treatments in even Western countries [4][5][6][7]. Acupuncture has also been suggested to be effective in relieving inflammatory pain. ST36 (Zusanli) and SP9 (Yinlingquan) acupoints have been tried for pain-relieving effects of acupuncture stimulation [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. For example, Oh et al. [13] reported that manual acupuncture or electroacupuncture at ST36 and SP9 relieves arthritic pain in rats. Cha et al. [8,9] observed that electroacupuncture at ST36 and SP9 relieves neuropathic pain in rats. According to Shou et al. [14], electroacupuncture at ST36 and BL60 (Kunlun) inhibited thermal hyperalgesia in adjuvant arthritis model of rats. Our previous study [10] reported that electroacupuncture at BL60 relieved formalin-induced pain in rats.",

The formalin-induced pain model has more advantages than other chemicals because it is a better method for visually verifying pain behaviors [16]. Subcutaneously injected formalin produces moderate and continuous pain generated by affected tissue [17], while not requiring anesthesia [18]. Formalin-induced pain produces biphasic behavioral responses that last for approximately an hour, including flinching, licking, biting, and shaking. The early phase starts immediately after the injection of formalin and decreases gradually; then the late phase begins with increase in pain again after approximately ten minutes [16]. The early phase in the biphasic responses is likely caused by direct tissue damage, while the late phase is due to peripheral inflammation and central sensitization [19]. In other words, the early and late phases have distinctive attributes, which allow the formalin-injected pain model to be one of the most effective methods for identifying the mechanism of pain.",

The ST36 acupoint is located between the tibia and fibula at approximately 5 mm lateral and 5 mm lower to the anterior tubercle of the tibia [15]. The SP9 acupoint is located in a depression between the posterior border of the tibia and the gastrocnemius muscle near the knee joint or the inferior border of the medial condyle of the tibia [9]. The BL60 acupoint is located at the ankle joint level and between the external malleolus and tendon [26]. A lipid tissue found along the border of the body's trunk at the thigh on the ipsilateral side was selected as our non-acupoint [9].",

Yuan et al. [32] recorded neural responses of neurons from the primary somatosensory cortex to electroacupuncture or manual acupuncture at ST36. And they found that the neurons responded to manual acupuncture and electroacupuncture but the extent of action of manual acupuncture was smaller than that of electroacupuncture, suggesting the difference of analgesic effects of manual acupuncture and electroacupuncture. Furthermore, Leung et al. [33] reported that the de qi sensation may be qualitatively and quantitatively different between manual acupuncture and electroacupuncture. Electroacupuncture has been known to be more effective in relieving pain than manual acupuncture [34][35][36]. These studies suggest that electroacupuncture may be more effective in relieving pain than manual acupuncture. However, we observed the analgesic effect of manual acupuncture at BL60 in the present study similarly to our previous study in which electroacupuncture at BL60 produced the analgesic effect.",

Therefore, a change in the spinal cord may reflect the physiological and behavioral correlates produced by acupuncture analgesia. According to Coderre et al. [37], central neural changes which are essential for the expression of pain during the late phase occur during the early phase in the formalin-induced pain model. For example, tonic formalin pain is reduced by brief spinal anesthesia given before the formalin injection. Spinal anesthesia after the early phase did not reduce behavioral responses in the late phase. In brief, the pain-suppression effect that results from acupuncture stimulation prior to the injection of formalin or before starting the early phase is stronger in the late phase rather than the early phase. In addition, the acupuncture stimulation appears to be highly related to the central components rather than the peripheral ones.",

Therefore, flinching may be a more robust parameter because it is less contaminated by other non-nociceptive behavioral changes [16].

Laminae I, II and V in the spinal cord dorsal horn, where primary afferent nerves are projected, show a prominent increase in c-Fos expression after noxious stimulation [24]. The suppression in c-Fos expression is closely related with the activation of endogenous opioid peptides. Previous studies have reported that in a formalin-induced pain model, c-Fos expression decreases by injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-R1 antigens [40] and that c-Fos expression in the spinal cord due to nociceptive stimuli can be suppressed not only by analgesics like morphine [41] but also by noradrenaline [42] and NMDA-receptor antagonists [43]. Other reports have implied that the analgesic effects of acupuncture are related with the endogenous opioid system [44,45] as well as monoamine secretion in the midbrain and the activity of the autonomic nervous system [46][47][48].",

These results suggest that acupuncture analgesia against inflammatory pain induced by formalin was related to behavioral responses in the late phase rather than the early phase. In addition, the analgesic effects of acupuncture stimulation at ST36 and SP9 acupoints cannot be excluded even though behavioral analgesia produced by acupuncture at ST36 and SP9 was less than analgesia by acupuncture at BL60. However, the fact that the c-Fos expression in the early-phase-related laminae I-II significantly decreased for all acupuncture groups including acupuncture at ST36, SP9, BL60, and non-acupoint compared to the group that received formalin injection only was not explained by the specificity of these acupoints. This result indicates that acupuncture stimulation may be influential to diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC) at least in part [15].",

Acupuncture at ST36 or SP9 acupoint tended to inhibit flinching behavior, but the analgesic effect was not statistically significant while it significantly inhibited c-Fos expression. These results suggest that the acupuncture stimulation at BL60 may be more effective in relieving inflammatory pain compared to the acupuncture at ST36 or SP9 acupoint.",
