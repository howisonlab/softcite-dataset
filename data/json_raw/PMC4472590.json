Overview of Literature: The spine supports the body during different activities by maintaining appropriate body alignment and posture. Normal alignment of the spine depends on its structural, muscular, bony, and articular performance. Methods: Two hundred forty-one students participated in this study. A single examiner evaluated the angles of lumbar lordosis and thoracic kyphosis by using a flexible ruler. To determine the severity and frequency of pain in low-back and inter-scapular regions, a tailor-made questionnaire with visual analog scale was used. Finally, using the Kendall correlation coefficient, the data were statistically analyzed. Results: The mean value of lumbar lordosis was 34.46\u00b0\u00b112.61\u00b0 in female students and 22.46\u00b0\u00b19.9\u00b0 in male students. The mean value of lumbar lordosis significantly differed between female and male students (p<0.001). However, there was no difference in the level of the thoracic curve (p=0.288). Relationship between kyphosis measured by using a flexible ruler and inter-scapular pain in male and female students was not significant (p=0.946). However, the relationship between lumbar lordosis and low back pain was statistically significant (p=0.006). Also, no significant relationship was observed between abnormal kyphosis and frequency of inter-scapular pain, and between lumbar lordosis and low back pain. Conclusions: Lumbar lordosis contributes to low back pain. The causes of musculoskeletal pain could be muscle imbalance and muscle and ligament strain.",

Many studies have proved the validity and reliability of using flexicurve in comparison with radiographic data. A systematic review of validity and reliability of the nonradiographic method showed high to very high levels of reliability of the Flexicurve. This study suggested that flexicurve is an easy to use, hand-held tool, and it could replace radiography in evaluating lumbar lordosis [17]. However, with respect to cervical lordosis, there are some studies that showed that the flexicurve sagittal skin contour measurement has poor concurrent validity compared to radiographic measurements [20]. It seems that postural or X-ray positioning and radiographic analysis lead to appearance of confounding variables, which affects the results. Also, obesity, muscular development, previous trauma, and biomechanical complexities of the cervical spine could result in some differences in the measurement of surface contour compared to lateral radiographs [20]. According to previous research, the flexicurve kyphosis angle provides strong validity and reliability. Furthermore, it is inexpensive and can be easily used by the entry-level research staff, requires short measurement time, and does not expose the patients to high radiation risk. It seems that the use of this measurement method for detection of spine abnormalities and examination of the posture in healthy subjects is quite beneficial [21].",

However, there are limited evidences to illustrate the causes of age-related lumbar lordosis, and further research is required to determine the influence of age on lordosis [22]. Therefore, in the present study, as all participants were young (aged between 19 to 21 years), we did not aim to evaluate the effect of age on the amount of kyphosis and lordosis. Lumbar lordosis showed a significant difference between both genders (p<0.001); however, no difference was seen in the thoracic curve (p=0.288).

Several factors are involved in causing low back pain such as disc degeneration, muscle stretch, age, and occupation [25]. Clinical observations indicate the role of postural anomalies in low back pain [13]. In this study, lordosis in the students was significantly related to low back pain, and this finding corresponded with that in the study by McKenzie [26] which showed that low back pain occurred as a result of long and inaccurate over-stretching of the soft tissue in an abnormal posture. That is, as the extensor muscles become overloaded during lordosis, low back pain may emerge.",

It could be concluded that through a simple examination of the spine, such abnormalities can be identified as well as chronic spinal pain can be prevented.",
