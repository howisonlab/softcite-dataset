            "text": "The necessity of multilocus data sets for phylogenetic analysis is now largely taken for granted. Low-copy nuclear sequences have long been advocated for the future of plant phylogenetic reconstruction, especially at low taxonomic levels where their high rate of evolution (particularly for introns) results in moreresolved phylogenetic hypotheses ( Sang, 2002 ). These types of markers are also critical for accounting for phylogenetic discord across the genome, caused by such widespread phenomena as lineage sorting and hybridization. From the coalescent point of view, the canonical nonrecombining organellar genome (such as the typical angiosperm plastome, which has been heavily relied upon for developing Sanger markers) is essentially a single long phylogenetic marker with a single underlying history. This means that recent progress in the massive sequencing of entire organellar genomes (e.g., Ruhfel et al., 2014 ) does not necessarily equate in itself to adequate genomic sampling of phylogenetic signal for some questions, particularly at lower taxonomic levels, although such data sets may achieve high levels of phylogenetic resolution. The cost of whole genome shotgun sequencing has fallen dramatically in recent years, yet it remains costly to produce complete eukaryotic genomes at the scale typical for population and phylogenetic study (but see Cao et al., 2011 ), necessitating economical methods for broad subsampling of genomic loci. Genome skimming ( Straub et al., 2012 ) is simple and can result in large amounts of rDNA, chloroplast, and mitochondrial data, yet this alone may not offer enough independent loci if either coalescent methods or the gene trees themselves are of interest.",

Restriction-based methodologies such as RADSeq are most commonly used for population studies, and targeted sequencing methods, usually based on target enrichment via synthesized RNA probes, have gained traction at higher levels for phylogenetics ( McCormack et al., 2013 , table 1;Cronn et al., 2012 , table 5). For the taxonomic middle ground, at the level of species complex, appropriate methodologies remain unclear. While the best methodology may be lineage-specifi c to some extent, there remains a paucity of literature examining NGS methodology performance for 1 Manuscript received 6 April 2015; revision accepted 9 July 2015.

To address this gap, we present a method for enriching long loci spanning intron-exon boundaries in the genus Heuchera . \u2022 Methods: Two hundred seventy-eight loci were designed using a splice-site prediction method combining transcriptomic and genomic data. Biotinylated probes were designed for enrichment of these loci. Reference-based assembly was performed using genomic references; additionally, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes were used as references for offtarget reads. The data were aligned and subjected to coalescent and concatenated phylogenetic analyses to demonstrate support for major relationships. \u2022 Results: Complete or nearly complete (>99%) sequences were assembled from essentially all loci from all taxa. Aligned introns showed a fourfold increase in divergence as opposed to exons. Concatenated analysis gave decisive support to all nodes, and support was also high and relationships mostly similar in the coalescent analysis. Organellar phylogenies were also wellsupported and confl icted with the nuclear signal.",

Paired-end sequencing was performed by The Ohio State University Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center in six multiplexed runs with samples from unrelated projects (fi ve Illumina MiSeq runs with 300-bp reads; one Illumina HiSeq lane with 100-bp reads; all data uploaded to the Short Read Archive, accession SRP058301). This level of sequencing corresponds to approximately 7.5 \u00d7 expected average nuclear genomic coverage using 2C values from Godsoe et al. (2013) . While over-sampling of high-copy loci will reduce the actual coverage of the single-copy portion of the genome, most nuclear contigs consistently showed 5-8 \u00d7 coverage. These data were assembled in Velvet ( Zerbino and Birney, 2008 ) using a kmer length of 64, expected insert length of 700 bp, standard deviation of insert length 100 bp, and minimum contig length of 1000, to develop reference contigs for the low-copy portion of the genome. This resulted in 18,344 contigs between 1000 and 7360 bp; a longer kmer length results in longer contigs, but these were not necessary for marker development. A BLAST search against organellar references confi rmed that organellar and rDNA sequences were not present in this batch of contigs.",

The chloroplast genome was assembled by mapping all reads (trimmed with Geneious default settings) using the native Geneious assembler (version 7, Biomatters; available from http://www.geneious.com/ ) with medium sensitivity, using the chloroplast genome of H. sanguinea Engelm.

The resultant contig was manually screened for regions of mis-mapped reads (always due to large indels in intergenic spacers); at these points the consensus sequence was broken into subsequences. These subsequences were subjected to iterative assembly in Geneious (25 iterations), repeated until all consensus sequences of these assemblies overlapped (by de novo assembly in Geneious with default settings) and could be combined into a single circle. The read mapping was repeated on this resultant genome draft, and the complete lack of mis-mapping regions was confi rmed.",

The closest of these three references to each sample based on a preliminary Sanger chloroplast phylogeny (unpublished data) was used for reference-mapping to assist in assembling long, divergent intergenic regions. Development of a third plastome reference was necessary for the divergent intergenic regions of H. parishii , H. elegans Abrams, and H. abramsii Rydb.; this was constructed by mapping the H. parishii reads to the H. parvifl ora var. saurensis plastome in BWA and repeating the assembly refi nement methods used for the H. parvifl ora plastome assembly. Mitochondrial assembly used the fully assembled reference from H. parvifl ora var. saurensis . Because we desired purely mitochondrial signal for the mitochondrial phylogenetic analysis, this genome was blasted against the H. parvifl ora chloroplast genome and any hits were deleted from the mitochondrial assembly reference. Whole chloroplast genomes were aligned in MAFFT as with the single-copy markers; however, this was computationally infeasible for the much longer mitochondrial sequences. For these we used Mauve, setting an assumption of collinear genomes (which was enforced for our contigs by the read-mapping method) but otherwise using default settings.",

It is important to note that for these retained loci, we had two sources of assurance of their low-copy (likely single-copy) status: (a) they are single-copy in Arabidopsis , and (b) they had coverage consistent with singlecopy status in the H. parvifl ora Bartl. genome skimming work. This means that a fully or mostly assembled genome is not needed to identify low-copy targets, although such resources are useful when they are available ( Weitemier et al., 2014 ). We used GeneSeqer ( Brendel et al., 2004 ) to identify intron-containing loci among these hits. GeneSeqer aligns transcriptome sequences to genomic sequences using several available splice-site models, evaluates putative alignments based both on sequence similarity and splice-site strength, and outputs gapped sequence alignments. In our experience, these alignments are more accurate in the context of large indels (= introns) than those based on simple sequence alignment such as BLAST. The splice-site model we used was based on Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Our transcriptome sequences came from a SOAP assembly of H. sanguinea (courtesy of the 1KP project, D. Soltis, and G. Wong; assembly parameters available at https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/ wiki/display/iptol/Access+to+OneKP+data+set ), and the genomic data were the set of H. parvifl ora Velvet contigs that matched the COS marker data set. All GeneSeqer alignments were evaluated by eye to verify acceptable exon sequence identity (i.e., no obvious paralogy or spurious alignment) between H. sanguinea and H. parvifl ora var. saurensis. We mostly favored loci with at least two introns >100 bp long for locus development. A minority of chosen loci had a single longer intron, and two loci were included that were entirely exonic but appeared unusually variable based on alignment. We designed a 278-locus panel, synthesized by MYcroarray (Ann Arbor, Michigan) as 8634 120-bp oligomers tiled at 3 \u00d7 coverage of the target loci. The mean locus length was 1362 bp (range 555-3672 bp), for a total targeted length of 378,553 bp.",

Rooting is not as straightforward for the chloroplast data set because Heuchera is known to be polyphyletic for chloroplast markers due to frequent hybridization with closely related genera such as Tiarella L. Folk, Mandel, and Freudenstein, unpublished data). If a supposed outgroup had captured a Heuchera chloroplast genome, this would result in incorrectly rooting the tree within Heuchera . While a mitochondrial analysis has never been undertaken for the Heuchera group of genera, these concerns could also apply to the mitochondrial data. To address these concerns, we repeated the chloroplast and mitochondrial read-mapping approach for publicly available short read data from Saxifraga granulata L. (one individual from Meer et al., 2014 ) to develop an appropriate outgroup sequence well outside the Heuchera group of genera.",

The H. parvifl ora var. saurensis mitochondrial genome (541,954 bp; mean coverage 141.9 \u00d7 , draft map in Fig. 5 ) is much less conserved in terms of structure, as is typical for plant mitochondrial genomes ( Sloan, 2013 ), with only a few very short regions of synteny and only short stretches of similar sequence preserved when compared to the closest reference, V. vinifera (Appendix S2). It has all functional mitochondrial protein-coding genes that are present in Vitis , as well as numerous interspersed sequences of chloroplast origin. BLAST searches against the Marchantia polymorpha L. mitochondrial genome showed that all conserved mitochondrial genes absent in Vitis were also absent in Heuchera. Processes of intramolecular recombination and multiple conformations of the plant mitochondrial genome are thought to be mediated by moderately long repeat regions ( Alverson et al., 2011 , and citations therein), of which we found four. These repeat regions were independently supported by locally higher read coverage. Unusually , the smaller three repeat regions (6428 bp, 1196 bp, 550 bp) that we found overlap with the largest repeat (32,849 bp), but with a single copy of each elsewhere in the genome. The issue of multiple genome conformations is not critical for assemblies intended for analysis with phylogenetic methods. Using these two organellar references, we were able to infer resolved between samples. Even for the outgroup Mitella pentandra , where slight signs of intron dropout are apparent (~1% lower assembly completeness, Table 1 ), it remained possible to assemble the vast majority of intronic sequences.",

Coloring of branches represents the taxonomic sections recognized in Folk and Freudenstein (2014) : orange = sect. Holochloa ; blue = sect. Heuchera ; green = sect. Bracteatae ; magenta = sect. Rhodoheuchera. Values plotted on branches are support values based on 5000 bootstrap replicates. Varietal assignments in sections Heuchera and Rhodoheuchera refl ect the taxonomy of the treatments by Rosendahl et al. (1936) and Wells (1984) ; taxon labels in sect. Holochloa refl ect Folk and Freudenstein (in press).  ( Folk and Freudenstein, 2014 ); however, the increase in support was remarkable in several instances. The improvement in support over earlier work was most remarkable for section Rhodoheuchera ( Fig. 1 , marked in magenta), the largest in the genus (~17 species). In Folk and Freudenstein (2014) , this section was the most problematic group for phylogenetic inference; there was weak or no support for all relationships in the section, and at best moderate support for the monophyly of the section as a whole. The new data set confi dently confi rms the monophyly of sect. Rhodoheuchera and resolves relationships in this group. The analysis of the reduced Folk and Freudenstein (2014) matrix (Appendix S3) showed that higher support values were due to a mixture of reduced taxon sampling and more informative data. The average nodal bootstrap (BS) proportion was 100% for the entire phylogenomic data set and 78.4% for the Sanger data set; several nodes in the Sanger data set were higher than in earlier work. Nevertheless, the improvement caused by greater locus sampling is apparent; the addition of further taxa would infl ate the tree search space, likely causing a greater disparity between the two data sets. It is important to note that the Sanger tree was incongruent in several places with the phylogenomic data set; particularly, section Heuchera (blue, Appendix S3) is sister to the rest of the genus (BS 76). Likewise, the positions of H. rubescens var. versicolor (BS 45) and H. parvifl ora var. parvifl ora (BS 99) differed.

Fully assembled genomes are not required for marker development. At minimum, however, intronic locus design for targeted sequencing requires the researcher to obtain a large number of contigs at least as long as the desired marker length, as well as transcriptomic sequences to identify splice sites. Finally, some method must be used to select putative low-copy genes, such as curated genome drafts from the study organism ( de Sousa et al., 2014 ;Weitemier et al., 2014 ) or, when this information is absent, panels of loci derived from model organism genomes ( Mandel et al., 2014 ;this study). In the latter case, if genome skimming data are available from one of the study organisms, coverage data are effective as an independent source of evidence for low-copy marker status.",

Examining confl icting histories necessitates sequences long enough to infer resolved gene trees. The ability to assemble large amounts of off-target organellar data with such methods further results in a robust sampling of alternative genomic histories. Likewise, sequence divergence will usually be low in recent radiations, with the result that targeting more conserved portions of the genome may waste sequencing effort. Compounding these diffi culties for any inferential method is the effect of missing data; we have shown that this method results in essentially no missing data for targeted nuclear markers and chloroplast data (in contrast to a typical RNA-seq or RAD-seq experiment; see also Weitemier et al., 2014 ).",

As systematists grapple with gene tree heterogeneity in the most diffi cult systems, targeted methods optimized for gene tree resolution are poised to address all of these concerns. Introncontaining low-copy sequence markers, long-favored for Sanger sequencing ( Folk and Freudenstein, 2014 , and citations therein), will be increasingly important in genera and species complexes for a robust sampling not only for a total-evidence phylogeny, but more critically for individual gene histories.",
