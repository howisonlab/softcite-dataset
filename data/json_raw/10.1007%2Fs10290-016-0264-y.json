            "text": "In May 2012 the Spanish government announced a debt-financed recapitalization of the undercapitalized Spanish banking system. Although there was a wide consensus among economists and policymakers that this was key to solving Spain's economic troubles, both bank CDS and sovereign CDS further increased in the days following the announcement while lower bank CDS spreads were expected. Higher sovereign debt discounts deteriorated the fiscal position of the Spanish government. We propose a mechanism that can explain the events in Spain, namely the interaction whereby weak banks that are heavily exposed to risky domestic sovereign debt and weak government finances set off a negative amplification cycle: additional debt issue leads to higher sovereign debt discounts, resulting in capital losses on existing sovereign debt, deteriorating the capital base of banks, additional rounds of interest rate increases, a perverse amplification cycle substantially offsetting the initial recapitalization. We construct a DSGE model with balance-sheetconstrained financial intermediaries that finance private loans to the real economy, as well as sovereign debt subject to sovereign default risk. We calibrate the model to Spanish data, and find that our model is capable of matching the developments in the sovereign bond market in Spain in May/June 2012 quite well.

Conventional theory predicts that such a recapitalization should decrease bank CDS spreads, as happened in the US after the forced recapitalization of the larger US banks under the SCAP program of May 2009 (Hoshi and Kashyap 2014). And since the main risk to the Spanish government at the time seemed to be the risk of having to bail out the banking system, expectations were that CDS spreads on sovereign debt would fall as well. But contrary to predictions and apparently at variance with the US 2009 experience, CDS spreads for the banks, after a short temporary dip immediately following the recap announcement, continued their rise after the announcements, and so did sovereign CDS spreads, as can be seen from Fig. 1. This is remarkable since, under normal circumstances, a recapitalization increases loss absorption capacity of the bank concerned and should result in lower CDS spreads. In turn looser leverage constraints for banks should lead to increased loan supply to non-financial firms, eventually generating higher tax revenues for the government. In addition, better capitalized banks reduce the probability of the need for a fiscally costly bail out. Both factors would lead one to expect lower CDS spreads for sovereigns too. Yet in Spain CDS spreads continued their upward drift with consequent effects on interest rates, deteriorating the fiscal position of the Spanish government further. In June 2012, the Spanish government applied for emergency funding from the EFSF/ESM. We will argue that the observed response can be explained by a negative feedback loop arising between undercapitalized banks that hold risky sovereign debt on the one hand and weak government finances on the other: 1 issuing additional risky sovereign debt to fund a government bailout of commercial banks will lead to falling bond prices everything else equal; when commercial banks have a large exposure to this debt, they will therefore incur capital losses on these bonds. So falling bondprices imply that bank capital will take a hit, thereby limiting the headroom for new loans. Credit spreads and interest rates increase, and lead to lower private credit provision. Higher interest rates on government debt further increase the amount of debt the government needs to issue to fund its operations.But higher debt issue leads to a second round of bond price drops, and so on, setting off a vicious cycle whereby weak banks and weak sovereigns get into a negative amplification cycle. In such an environment, the capital losses on existing holdings of sovereign debt can potentially offset the initial increase in bank capital due to the recapitalization by the government.",

            "text": "A key feature of this negative feedback loop is the fact that Spanish commercial banks were undercapitalized after the end of the housing and construction boom of the 2000s (International Monetary Fund 2011; Hoshi and Kashyap 2014). We therefore follow Gertler and Karadi (2011) and introduce balance-sheet-constrained financial intermediaries into a standard New-Keynesian DSGE model. 2 We extend their setup in two directions: The first extension is to allow financial intermediaries to hold sovereign debt in addition to loans to the private sector. To allow for the possibility of capital losses on sovereign debt holdings, we introduce long-term maturity government bonds in a setup which is very similar to Woodford  The blue slotted line depicts the CDS spread for Spanish sovereign debt with a maturity of 5 years, while the red solid line depicts the average CDS spread for Spanish banks (5 years, fully restructured, senior unsecured). The first vertical line is May 9th, 2012, at which the Spanish government announced the restructuring of the Spanish financial sector, while the second vertical line depicts June 25th, 2012, at which the eurogroup approved financial sector aid to Spain. Banks in the sample include Banco Popolare Espanol, Banco Santander, Caixa Bank and BBVA. Source: Datastream, own calculations (color figure online) (1998,2001). Such a setup avoids the escalating dimension of the state space that a less parsimonious approach to lengthening maturity would lead to. The second extension is to introduce endogenous sovereign default risk following Schabert and Van Wijnbergen (2014), which is a second channel that gives rise to potential capital losses on sovereign debt. The resulting default model is also used in Van der Kwaak and Van Wijnbergen (2014). The production sector contains price-stickiness and monopolistic competition to have real effects from monetary policy. Households consume, provide labor and save through deposits placed at financial intermediaries. Because our goal is to investigate whether the negative amplification cycles between weakly capitalized banks and weak sovereign finances can explain the failure of the Spanish government to recapitalize the Spanish financial sector, we calibrate the model to Spanish data by using parameters from the Bayesian estimation results by Burriel et al. (2010) where applicable, using in addition several specific sources for aggregate Spanish data (see the calibration appendix) to match moments in the data. The main contribution of our paper is that we provide an explanation for the inability of the Spanish government to implement a debt-financed recapitalization of the Spanish financial sector in May/June 2012. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first paper to do so within a DSGE framework specifically calibrated to capture the dynamics of the Spanish economy. A second contribution of our paper is to investgiate the effectiveness of alternative recapitalization policies by foreign entities such as the EFSF/ESM.",

If Spain indeed fell victim to the two-way feedback loop between a distressed financial sector and increased sovereign credit risk, our model has important policy implications for countries that are in a similar position as Spain was before the attempted intervention. That would be most Southern European countries, such as Italy, Portugal and Greece, who also face issues related to sovereign debt sustainability, while commercial banks in these countries are heavily exposed to the domestic sovereign, as can be seen from Fig. 2, which shows the exposure to the domestic sovereign as a percentage of Tier-1 capital. Spanish banks have an exposure to Spanish sovereign debt of 150 % of Tier-1 capital while Italian banks and Greek banks have an exposure of 200 % respectively 250 % of Tier-1 capital. From these figures it is clear that domestic sovereign debt holdings of commercial banks are substantial and that stress in the sovereign debt market will seriously and negatively affect the financial sector. Countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal could face the same troubles should they attempt to recapitalize their financial sector through additional debt issue. The potential failure of such a recap severely limits the policy options for these governments, and might leave them in a situation where only a direct recapitalization by a foreign entity such as the EFSF/ESM is capable of breaking the feedback link between weak banks and weak sovereigns. Such a direct recapitalization is the final policy experiment we will perform with our model. A major conclusion is that without such Eurozone institutions, weak banks and weak governments would form a much more poisonous mix.",

Strong economic growth and low interest rates led to a booming construction sector, with banks massively pooring funds into Spanish real estate. The subprime mortgage crisis spilled over from the United States into Europe in 2008 through the international banking system. Even though Spanish commercial banks had experienced relatively few losses during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, due to a regulatory prohibition to invest in subprime mortgage products, the global financial crisis ended the housing boom that had endured in Spain during most of the 2000s. Falling real estate prices and losses on mortgages and construction loans resulted in significant bank losses, which first started to hit the Spanish financial sector in late 2010, with output falling after the first quarter of 2011. The burst of the real estate bubble left Spanish banks undercapitalized, which together with the broader sovereign debt crisis that had erupted in Greece in May 2010, started a vicious cycle exposing the negative link between losses on the balance sheets of banks, exploding borrowing costs, increases in public debt and a decrease in access to credit. A shrinking economy and vast unemployment were the result (International Monetary Fund 2011, 2014).",

            "text": "In response to the financial crisis which had substantially hurt its national banks, Spain committed in May 2012 to provide new capital to banks (through additional debt issue) in case they failed to raise it privately. At the time, the government expected that an injection of public capital in the hurting Spanish banks would restore financial markets confidence, and relax the leverage constraints of banks, creating more space on bank balance sheets for loans to the Spanish private sector. Expectations of a significant increase in Spanish public debt, however, put upward pressure on Spanish bond yields and drove bond prices down, as can be seen from Fig. 3: we clearly see financial markets reacting to announcements regarding financial aid for Spanish banks during this timespan, with the bond yield increasing by 1.2 % and the CDS spread by 100 basis points. These are significant numbers, especially given the timespan of \\2 months. When the Spanish government nationalized BFA-Bankia on May 9th, both the yield and CDS spread experienced a sharp increase the very same day. The announcement of plans to restructure the bank with an additional capital injection of 19 billion Euro on May 23th reversed a downward movement in the yield and CDS spread, indicating a new perception on the markets of increased risk. When it became clear at the beginning of June 2012 that Spain would not be able to fund a recapitalization on its own as a result of dampening demand for its debt papers, the yield and CDS spread again started to increase rapidly, driving borrowing costs to unsustainable levels, thereby preventing the Spanish government from obtaining the necessary funds for the recapitalization on the financial markets (Reuters 2012). Instead, the Spanish government was forced to apply for a loan from the EFSF/ESM (European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism) to perform the much needed recapitalization of the financial sector (Eurogroup 2012). The announcement by the Spanish government that it would need up to 100 billion Euro from the EFSF/ESM on June 9th marked the start of an extended period of sharply increasing bond yields and CDS spreads. On June 25th, 2012 the Spanish government submitted an official request to obtain the necessary funds from the EFSF/ESM. This request was approved by the Eurogroup and the responsibility for the financing of the bank rescue programme was transferred to the newly established ESM (European Stability Mechanism) in November 2012. The most important aspect of the programme was the recapitalization of banks with a capital shortfall. An independent stress test of the balance sheets of all Spanish banks identified ten banks that were unable to reach a Core Tier-1 capital ratio of 6 % by the end of 2014 under an adverse scenario. The identified capital shortfalls totalled 56 billion euros, or 5.5 % of GDP. Public capital injections in the first quarter of 2013 accounted for approximately 70 % of these shortfalls, while the remaining capital shortfalls were addressed by bailing-in junior debt and private capital injections (International Monetary Fund 2014). Although the exact days in which the recapitalizations took place are unknown, a similar trend as in May/June 2012 can be discerned around January 2013, the month in which the bulk of the capital injections was completed. This can be seen in Fig. 4. After a drop in the yield and CDS spread till January 11th, a slight upward trend is visible during the next month while the Spanish government increases its debt and transfers capital to its banks. After February, the yield and CDS spread shows a decreasing trend, indicating the positive effects of the recapitalization.",

The sovereign defaults after an unanticipated large shock drives the debt over a maxumum level compatible with the maximum tax revenue cosntraint the sovereign faces. The defaults are not a strategic choice, as they are for example in Arellano (2008) and in much of the recent debt crisis literature surveyed in Aguiar and Amador (2013), our default model is closer in spirit to the debt overhang literature in corporate finance. Also, in line with that latter literature, defaults are partial, while most of the strategic default literature assumes default to be a 0-1 decision, once a sovereign defaults it defaults on all outstanding debt. However this is mostly an ad hoc assumption made to avoid having to endogenize post-default bargaining, and in striking contradiction of almost all actual sovereign defaults (Cruces and Trebesch 2013). Finally since we do not model default as the outcome of a strategic choice, there is no need to incorporate an explicit punishment mechanism (like exclusion of capital markets after a default). Our focus is on the bond price impact after an increase in ex ante sovereign default risk, rather than the losses arising from an actual default.",

We take the standard deviations of the cyclical components of Spanish real GDP and gross fixed capital formation to match the standard deviations of the cyclical components of output and investment from the simulated model. For the credit spread, we take the timeseries described in Sect. 5.1. Simulated moments from the model are then compared to the data. In addition, we report the first order autocorrelations for the same variables. 6 The results of this exercise are reported in Table 2. We indicate the statistical significance of differences between the empirical moments and the simulated moments by reporting the associated t-statistics in square brackets. We see that the standard deviations for GDP, credit spread and investmentl are matched well by the model, as indicated by an absolute value of the t-statistic below 2. This is not surprising, as these were the three moments we targeted in our simulation. In addition, we report the standard deviation of bank capital for both the data and the simulated model, and we find that the model matches the data in this dimension as well, as the accompanying t-statistic is below 2 in absolute value, in spite of the fact that this variable was not included in the target list.",

Similar to the standard deviation for bank capital, we did not target these moments in the moment matching exercise. We nevertheless find that the first order autocorrelations of the simulated model and the data do not differ statistically significant, as the tvalues for all variables are below 2 in absolute value. We conclude that our calibrated model captures the dynamics observed in the data reasonably well. For output and investment we take data from the Eurostat website. We take quarterly data that are seasonally and calendar adjusted, chain linked volumes (2010) in million euros. For the credit spread, we take the timeseries described in Sect. 5.1, which comes from the ECB website. Bank capital is also retrieved from the website of the ECB (''Capital and reserves''), which is a monthly timeseries. First we convert bank capital to real terms by dividing by the monthly CPI level in Spain. A single model simulation starts from the non-stochastic steady state and lasts for a 1020 periods. We discard the first 1000 observations as a burn-in. We perform 10,000 simulations for each gridpoint of the state space. Next we take the natural logarhitm of output, investment and bank capital for both the empirical and the simulated data, but not for the credit spread. The quarterly timeseries are obtained by taking an unweighted average of the monthly data, insofar as needed. We then find the cyclical components of the empirical data and the simulated data by applying the Hodrick-Prescott filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600. The estimation consists of minimizing g T \u00f0h\u00de 0 g T \u00f0h\u00de, where g T \u00f0h\u00de is a vector with the difference between the standard deviation from the data and the simulations for output, credit spread and investment, and T the number of observations, in our case 20.

We compare the case with no additional government policy, and contrast the results with the case where the government issues additional debt to fund a recapitalization of the Spanish banking system (Sect. 6.1). Next we compare the debt-financed recap with the case where the recap is executed by an external party outside Spain, such as the EFSF or ESM (Sect. 6.2). We pin down the timing of our simulation by looking at the unfolding of the events in Spain. Losses on mortgages and construction loans first started to hit the Spanish financial sector in late 2010, with output falling after the first quarter of 2011. The first period in our simulations therefore coincides with the beginning of 2011. The actual recapitalization of the Spanish banks mainly took place at the start of 2013. We therefore set the recapitalization to occur 8 quarters after the start of the financial crisis. Since 70 % of the total costs of the financial reform was accounted for by direct injections of public capital, we set the size of the recapitalization to 39.2 billion Euros. This is approximately equal to 3 % of annual Spanish GDP before the start of the financial crisis. Our policy intervention will therefore in both simulations consist of a capital injection of 12 % of quarterly steady state GDP, announced when the crisis erupts but implemented 8 quarters later. As to the financial crisis to which the policies are a response, we follow a different approach than most of the Financial Frictions literature sofar. Following Gertler and Karadi (2011), the crisis is typically modeled as a quality shock lowerering the effective stock of capital and its price, which in turn leads to capital losses on the banks' asset portfolio. In this setup the crisis originates in the real sector and spills over into the financial sector. Instead we let the original shock occur within the financial sector itself, with subsequent negative real sector effects through the ensuing credit tightening. In particular the original crisis is mimicked by a shock to the diversion parameter k k t for private loans, the closest we can come to a confidence shock in the financial sector. 7",

However that would run into the problem outlined in the previous session as the sovereign debt would increase too, to another creditor perhaps, but debt levels would rise. An alternative has been considered after these problems did in fact emerge during the interventions in the Spanish banking crisis: one of the proposed solutions to break the vicious cycle between weak banks and weak sovereigns in the Eurozone is allowing the ESM to directly recapitalize banks that face a capital shortfall. Such a restructuring method would not force a sovereign to issue additional bonds to finance the recap, and recapitalize banks without the sovereign incurring additional debt. The positive effects from a bank recap remain, while the negative consequences of increased sovereign default risk are absent. In order to simulate this scenario, we set the parameter j e equal to zero. Banks are now recapitalized by an external party (ESM), and receive external assets s e t , together with an increase in net worth.

Taking the interest rate at the start of May 2012 of 5.9 % in Fig. 3, which already includes sovereign default risk (see the accompanying CDS spread), this still constitutes an increase of 20 %. The negative feedback mechanism between the sovereign and the domestic commercial banks, whereby an increase in sovereign debt to fund the recap causes bond prices to drop and further impair commercial bank balance sheets, therefore seems to be apparent in the data during the restructuring of the Spanish financial sector, which is also indicated by a marked increase in the sovereign CDS spread.",

The negative feedback mechanism might substantially affect the effectiveness of conventional recapitalization operations to the point where such a recap harms the recovery in the short run. In that case unconventional ways of recapitalizing the banking system are necessary.

In that case alternative policies have to be considered, such as assistance by another actor with a stronger balance sheet. We look at one such approach, namely a direct recapitalization by a foreign entity such as the ESM. We find that the results of such an external recap are positive: bond prices do not experience the steep fall that occurs after a debt-financed recap, and there is less crowding out of private loans, leading to a faster recovery. Although the economic benefits of such an external assistance seem clear, political factors might of course complicate this option, vide the resistance by Germany to direct recaps by the ESM.",

The intuition for the leverage constraint is straightforward: a higher shadow value of assets m k t implies a higher value from an additional unit of assets, which raises the continuation value of the financial intermediary, thereby making it less likely that the banker will steal. A higher shadow value of net worth g t implies a higher expected profit from an additional unit of net worth, while a higher fraction k a t implies that the banker can steal a larger fraction of assets, which induces the household to provide less funds to the banker, resulting in a lower leverage ratio everything else equal.",

The subjective discount factor b, the share of effective capital in production a and the coefficients of the Taylor rule j p and j y are taken from Burriel et al. (2010). The smoothing parameter of the nominal interest rate q r is set to 0.8, in line with the literature. We set the inverse Frisch elasticity of labour supply u equal to 0.1, and adjust the disutility of labor coefficient W to have steady state labor supply of 1/3. Parameters that have been approximated using Bayesian estimation include habit formation t, the elasticity of substitution between intermediate goods , the Calvo probability w and the investment adjustment parameter c. Burriel et al. (2010) find a value for the Calvo probability w of 0.898. This, however, gives only explosive solutions. Therefore, the Calvo probability is reduced to 0.8, for which the model has a unique, stable solution. The price-indexation parameter c P is set to 0.241, following Gertler and Karadi (2011). We follow the value from Gertler and Karadi (2011) for the investment adjustment cost parameter c. We assume the average lifetime of bankers to be equal to 24 quarters, resulting in a survival rate h of 0.9583. The maturity structure parameter q is calibrated to reflect the weighted average maturity of government bonds in Spain between 1998 and 2008, which is 6,1 years according to the OECD Stats database. q is therefore set to 0.97 (duration in quarters \u00bc 1=\u00f01 \u00c0 bq\u00de). The annual fixed real payment on longterm government bonds is set to 4.1 %, which is the 1998-2008 average of the interest rate on Spanish government bonds with a maturity of 10 years found in the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank (2014).

The 15-year average percentage of GDP that can be ascribed to private investment and government consumption is taken between 1994 and 2008. This results in steady state ratios of 22.6 per cent for investments over GDP and 17.8 per cent for government consumption over GDP. This pins down the depreciation rate d at a quarterly 3.55 per cent. The steady state ratio of government debt to output is set to 53.2 per cent, which is the 1995-2008 average of Spanish government debt to GDP ratio. For the steady state credit spread C, the difference between the loans to non-financial corporations (''Total'') and the deposit rate on ''Household deposits redeemable at notice, Total, New Business'' for the period between 2003 and 2007 is taken. Loan rates are not available before 2003. We end the sample at the end of 2007 to exclude data from the Great Recession. For the 2003-2007 period we arrive at an average annual credit spread in Spain of 188 basis points (annually), which amounts to a steady state quarterly spread of 47 basis points. We calibrate the ratio of the diversion parameter for government bonds k b t and the diversion rate for private loans k k t to be constant and equal to 0.5 times, as in Gertler and Karadi (2013). To make sure that this value does not drive our results, we investigate the model response for different values of k b t =k k t in the Online Appendix. We set the diversion rate for external bonds equal to zero, as we assume that these bonds are be safe and liquid assets that cannot be diverted. This results in a bank balance sheet of which approximately 25 % consists of sovereign debt. The target value of gross inflation p is set to 1.005, implying a 2 % net inflation target, which is in line with the ECB inflation target.",

Leverage ratios go as high as 34 for Banco Santander, whereas other financial institutions clearly have lower leverage ratios. To attempt to average across these different segments of the financial sectors, the average ratio of consolidated equity to consolidated financial assets of the Spanish financial sector is taken between 2001 and 2008 from the OECD Stats database. This results in a steady state leverage ratio of 5.1, which resembles the leverage ratio chosen by Gertler and Karadi (2011) of 4. Given the fact that the loans to the private sector are state-contingent, and thus more equity like, more volatility is generated in bank net worth everything else equal. hence a lower steady state leverage ratio can compensate the higher volatility induced by the equity like debt contracts, just as Gertler and Karadi (2013), who choose a lower steady state leverage ratio for the same reason. This leverage ratio results in a sovereign debt exposure of approximately 146 % of net worth, which is slightly lower but close to the number in Fig. 2.  ",

The calibration of the real economy is not affected by the introduction of sovereign default risk. For the financial sector, the steady state bond price q b changes, and hence b. We calibrate the maximum level of government liabilities q b b max = y to be at 70 % of annual steady state GDP. Different values could have been chosen, but the main point of the paper is to show the mechanisms that interplay when debt levels get close to the maximum level of debt. We leave the steady state fraction of government liabilities q b b= y at 53.2 % annual steady state output target. The reason for this freedom is the fact that we have a new variable, the level of debt in case of no government debtb t , and the steady state tax rate that we can adjust in order to still be able to hit our original targets. The steady state default probability is set at a rather conservative estimate of D \u00bc 0:0025, which implies an annual default probability of 1 %, which is small given the observed bond spreads in the European periphery. We now apply calibration strategy 1 to find the parameters of the (option) approximation. Calibration strategy 1 cannot go further than a maximum level of government liabilities of 65 % of annual steady state GDP. We therefore use the option parameters that we found for a maximum level of government liabilities equal to 70 % of annual steady state GDP, and change to calibration strategy 2 which can still be applied, and calibrate the model at a maximum level of government liabilities of 60 % of annual steady state GDP. This changes the steady state default probability to D \u00bc 0:0128.",
