            "text": "Background While electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment has been found to ameliorate migraine-like symptoms, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that the brainstem descending pain modulatory system, comprising the periaqueductal grey (PAG), raphe magnus nucleus (RMg), and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), may be involved in migraine pathophysiology. We hypothesised that EA would ameliorate migraine-like symptoms via modulation of this descending system. Methods We used a conscious rat model of migraine induced by repeated electrical stimulation of the dura. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: an EA group, which received EA at GB20 following dural stimulation; a sham acupuncture (SA) group, which received manual acupuncture at a non-acupuncture point following dural stimulation; a Model group, which received dural stimulation but no acupuncture; and a Control group, which received neither dural stimulation nor acupuncture (electrode implantation only). HomeCageScan was used to measure effects on behaviour, and immunofluorescence staining was used to examine neural activation (c-Fos immunoreactivity) in the PAG, RMg, and TNC. Results Compared to the Model group, rats in the EA group showed a significant increase in exploratory, locomotor and eating/drinking behaviour (p<0.01) and a significant decrease in freezing-like resting and grooming behaviour (p<0.05). There was a significant increase in the mean number of c-Fos neurons in the PAG, RMg, and TNC in Model versus Control groups (p<0.001); however, this was significantly attenuated by EA treatment (p<0.001). There were no significant differences between the SA and Model groups in behaviour or c-Fos immunoreactivity. Conclusions EA pretreatment ameliorates behavioural changes in a rat model of recurrent migraine, possibly via modulation of the brainstem descending pathways.",

            "text": "Migraine is a debilitating neurological disease that affects millions worldwide, including up to 12% of American and 9.3% of Chinese people. 1 2 It is characterised by recurrent attacks of unilateral headache that can be aggravated by routine physical activity, 3 resulting in reduced function. 4 The brainstem descending pain modulatory system has been shown to play a vital role in migraine pathophysiology via effects on trigeminovascular nociceptive information transmission and central sensitisation. 5 Current drug treatments include migraine-specific medications (ergotamine, 5-HT 1B/1D/1F receptor agonists) and prophylactic treatments including antiepileptic drugs, lisuride, \u03b2-blockers, and ergot derivatives. However, these pharmacological agents have been associated with suboptimal efficacy, poor adherence and side effects, and have many contraindications. 6 7 Overall, an efficacious clinical treatment for migraine is lacking, particularly for prophylaxis and to delay progression of recurrent to chronic migraine.",

            "text": "We found that EA at GB20 reversed c-Fos immunoreactivity changes in migraine-related brain areas (compared to the Model group). These results provide neurophysiological support for the assertion that the effects of acupuncture pretreatment are mediated via the regulation of imbalances in the descending pain modulatory system. c-Fos is a protein marker of neuronal activation that has been used in diverse nociception research, including migraine. 23 The TNC, which receives input from peripheral sensory nerves, is the second-order neuron of the trigeminovascular system. Activation of the   TNC is regarded as a standard for activation and sensitisation of the trigeminovascular system and a reliable marker for the successful establishment of experimental models of headache. [23][24][25] Meanwhile, TNC inhibition has proven to be predictive of therapeutic anti-migraine efficacy.  Numerous investigations over the past half-century have established that the descending pain modulatory system arises in the brainstem from the PAG-rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVM) circuit to the spinal and medullary dorsal horn, and can exert bidirectional effects leading to both inhibition and facilitation of pain. 22 26 Electrophysiological studies by Fields and colleagues 27 have demonstrated that there are two distinct groups of RVM neurons producing opposite pain modulatory effects: (1) 'on'-cells mediating inhibition; and (2) 'off '-cells mediating facilitation. On-cells and off-cells form the neural basis for bidirectional control by the RVM and imbalance between these two cells types is implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of pain disorders, including migraine. For migraine, the descending pain modulatory pathway that is mainly involved is believed to be the PAG-RMg circuit to the TNC. The RMg is one of the important pain modulatory nuclei in the RVM region. On-cells and off-cells of the RMg project descending fibres to the TNC, suppressing or enhancing transmission of peripheral nociceptive information to the higher brain structures. 5 22 In agreement with previous studies, 25 28 our results showed significant increases in c-Fos immunoreactivity within the PAG, RMg, and TNC after repeated dural stimulation, supporting the notion that activation of the PAG-RMg pathway in the descending pain modulatory system contributes to migraine pathophysiology through impaired descending inhibition and/or enhanced descending facilitation. 22 Pretreatment with EA strikingly decreased c-Fos immunoreactivity within these structures. The alterations in c-Fos expression and positive behavioural changes in the EA group may reflect either an improvement of impaired descending inhibition and an enhancement of anti-nociception\u2500that is, decreased descending pain facilitation (through inhibition of off-cells) and/or increased descending pain inhibition (through facilitation of on-cells). This supports previous experimental work suggesting that acupuncture analgesia is mediated in part by the descending pain modulatory system. 29 ",
