We examined 7,240 adults aged 40-69 yr without MetS at baseline over a 45.5-month follow-up period. They were taken from the Anseong and Ansan cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Dairy product intake including milk, yogurt, and cheese was assessed with food frequency questionnaire. At the follow-up, the incidence of MetS was 17.1%. The incidences of MetS components were as follows: low HDL cholesterol (16.2%), abdominal obesity (14.0%), hypertriglyceridemia (13.8%), hyperglycemia (13.3%), and hypertension (13.1%). Adjusting for potential confounders, dairy product consumption frequency was inversely associated with the risk of MetS and abdominal obesity. Hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval) for dairy product consumption more than 7 times/week compared to never was 0.75 (0.64-0.88, P for trend < 0.001) for MetS and 0.73 (0.61-0.88, P for trend < 0.001) for abdominal obesity. HR for milk intake was 0.79 for MetS and 0.82 for abdominal obesity. The results of this study suggest that daily intake of dairy products protects against the development of MetS, particularly abdominal obesity, in middle-aged Koreans.",

            "text": "Obesity has become a global public health concern in recent decades. The prevalence of diet-related chronic diseases, including obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS), are increasing worldwide (1). In accordance with lifestyle changes following economic development, the leading causes of death in Korea are cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and liver disease (2). The prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and other adverse cardiometabolic outcomes has increased among Koreans. According to the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), the prevalence of obesity among adults was more than doubled from 20.5% in 1995 to 30.9% in 2009 (3,4). The prevalence of MetS in adults has increased primarily as a result of changes in lifestyle and diet, such as automobile use and fast food consumption (4). Obesity and MetS have become primary targets for public health intervention owing to the rapid change in mortality and chronic disease prevalence among Koreans.",

A review of 10 cross-sectional studies and 3 prospective studies of the relationship between dairy product consumption and MetS suggested a protective effect of dairy product consumption on MetS, but the evidence was inconclusive (7). The effects of dairy product consumption on obesity have been extensively explored. A recent meta-analysis suggested a protective effect of dairy product consumption on obesity; however, the effect was small (6). In general, dairy product consumption in Asia is much lower than in Western countries. There is little evidence that increasing dairy product consumption has protective effects against obesity and MetS in Asians.",

The FFQ was developed based on dietary intake data from the KNHANES (9) and has been previously validated using dietary records taken over 3 days during each of the four seasons in 124 participants as described elsewhere (10). The amount and frequency of milk, yogurt, and cheese intake were summed to calculate dairy product intake. For example, the amount of each food item was categorized into three serving sizes, 1/2, 1 (standard), and 2 servings. For milk, 1/2 cup equals to 100 mL. For the analyses, food intake was recoded into serving categories considering both frequencies and the amount. Intake frequency was regrouped into five categories from none to more than 7 times per week for the statistical analyses. The frequency of milk intake was analyzed separately from the other dairy products.",

According to the age-and sex-adjusted model, the risk of MetS was inversely associated with dairy product consumption (P for trend < 0.001, Table 3). In this model, the risk of MetS was significantly decreased in participants who consumed dairy products two to three times per week with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.99) as compared with those who never consumed dairy products. For participants who consumed dairy products seven or more times a week, the HR was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.62-0.84). Using the multivariate model, the HR for MetS for participants who consumed dairy products seven or more times a week was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.64-0.88), which was slightly higher than the HR of the age-and sex-adjusted model. The trend test in the multivariate model was statistically significant across the frequency of dairy product consumption (P < 0.001, Table 3). Analyses of the individual MetS components revealed that only abdominal obesity showed an inverse relationship with the frequency of dairy product consumption. The consumption of dairy products seven or more times per week was associated  with a decreased risk of abdominal obesity in both models (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.88, P for trend < 0.001 with multivariate model). The age-and sex-adjusted model showed that participants who consumed dairy products seven or more times per week had a significantly lower risk of hypertriglyceridemia (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.96) with marginal significance in the trend test. However, we found no significant association between dairy product intake and MetS components other than abdominal obesity in the multivariate-adjusted model. A similar trend was observed for milk intake ( Table 4). The multivariate model revealed that milk intake was inversely associated with the risk of abdominal obesity and MetS and showed a dose-response relationship such that the more frequently milk was consumed, the lower the risk of abdominal obesity and MetS was. The HR of the most frequent milk intake (> 7 times/ week) compared to none was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67-0.92) for MetS and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68-0.97) for abdominal obesity.

Literature reviews of the effects of dairy products on MetS and risk factors for cardiovascular disease suggest that dairy products play a role in the prevention of MetS development (16,17). van Meijl et al. (16) reported that various cross-sectional studies support an inverse association between dairy product consumption and the prevalence of MetS in some, but not all, populations. Recently, Otsuka et al. (18) examined the association between the number of MetS components and dietary factors in community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly Japanese subjects. In this cross-sectional study, a low intake of calcium, milk, and dairy products was associated with a high number of MetS components after adjusting for possible confounders, particularly in women. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that the majority of epidemiological studies showed an association between dairy product consumption and a lower risk of MetS.",

The results of present study are consistent with those of previous studies (6,20) suggesting a protective effect of dairy product consumption on obesity. Furthermore, a systematic review of prospective cohort studies concluded that dairy product consumption had a protective effect on the risk of obesity (6). Calcium, one of the many nutrients in dairy products, has been extensively investigated for its effect on weight loss. In a recent review of dairy product consumption and weight loss, Abargouei et al. (21) reported that epidemiological studies demonstrated low calcium intake was a risk factor for obesity in various population groups. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study comprising 3,157 black and white adults aged 18 to 30 yr of age (22), found that the odds ratio for lowering the risk for obesity by adding one serving per day of dairy products was 0.82 (0.72-0.93) over the next 10 yr. A recent crosssectional study on supplementary or dietary calcium intake and the risk of obesity in 8,127 Chinese men and women found an inverse relationship in women with a 14% reduction in abdominal obesity with the increase of each quartile of dietary calcium (23). Our finding of a significant inverse association between dairy product intake and abdominal obesity is consistent with these results.",

A study analyzing US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 data for adult population revealed an inverse association between whole milk, yogurt, calcium, and magnesium intake, and metabolic disorders (20). These investigators reported that the intake of one more daily serving of yogurt, but not other dairy products, lowered the risk of MetS by 60% (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.89). Furthermore, the authors suggested that ethnic differences in dairy product consumption and nutrient intake from dairy products, such as magnesium or phosphorus, might explain variations in the effect of dairy products on MetS. Moreover, they suggested that because of the complexity of the effect of dairy products and their nutrient contents on health, MetS might not have been a useful endpoint for the study. Although some studies resulted in the positive effect of conjugated linoleic acid in dairy fat on protecting metabolic syndrome, low fat dairy product is recommended to reduce cardiovascular risks (16). Overall, different components of diary products act synergistically, showing beneficial effects on prevention of metabolic syndrome. In the present study of Korean adults, most of the dairy product consumed was whole milk and yogurt because low-fat milk is not popular. Thus, the lack of significant association between dairy product intake and the lipid related components of MetS in this population may be explained by the lack of variation in dairy products consumed.",

Furthermore, the high response rate, comprehensive data collection through face-to-face interviews, inclusion of demographic and lifestyle factors, and the use of a validated FFQ all strengthened the results of our study. In the statistical analysis of this study, most well-known factors affecting MetS were included in the analysis as covariates, such as age, sex, physical activity, alcohol consumption, total energy intake, smoking status, education, and income . Due to the multicolinearity problem among dietary factors, we took parsimonious model for the statistical analysis by including total energy intake as one of the covariates. However, our follow-up period may have been a limitation. An average of 45.5 months follow-up period may not have been long enough to observe a dietary effect on components of MetS other than abdominal obesity. Thus, the possibility of a type 2 error existed and our study may lack enough power to detect other associations. However, the substantial incidence of abdominal obesity and MetS indicated sufficient statistical power to detect these differences. Future studies with greater statistical power are warranted to further examine the relationship between dairy product consumption and the risk of MetS components other than abdominal obesity.",
