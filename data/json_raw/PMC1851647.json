            "text": "Over the past few years, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification has emerged as an important regulator of diverse pathways and activities including protein localization and transcriptional regulation. We identified a consensus sumoylation motif (IKEE), located within the N-terminal activation domain of the ATF7 transcription factor and thus investigated the role of this modification. ATF7 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, homologous to ATF2, that binds to CRE elements within specific promoters. This protein is able to heterodimerize with Jun or Fos proteins and its transcriptional activity is mediated by interaction with TAF12, a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID. In the present article, we demonstrate that ATF7 is sumoylated in vitro (using RanBP2 as a E3-specific ligase) and in vivo. Moreover, we show that ATF7 sumoylation affects its intranuclear localization by delaying its entry into the nucleus. Furthermore, SUMO conjugation inhibits ATF7 transactivation activity by (i) impairing its association with TAF12 and (ii) blocking its binding-to-specific sequences within target promoters."

            "text": "In eukaryotic cells, post-translational protein modifications are crucial mechanisms to regulate protein function. Polypeptide conjugation to substrate proteins is one of these known mechanisms. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins are small polypeptides of about 8-11 kDa that covalently modify various intracellular proteins. Among these, the small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMO-1-4) are covalently linked as a 93-97 amino-acid polypeptides to specific target lysine residues (1)(2)(3)(4). Sumoylation is catalyzed by an enzymatic machinery analogous to that of ubiquitin-modification (2) and usually takes place at sites matching the sequence fKXE (where f stands for I, L or V and X for any amino acid residue). In addition to this core consensus motif, an extended sequence encompassing several acidic residues clustered within the 10-amino-acid region located immediately downstream has been recently described to play an important role in determining the efficiency of substrate sumoylation (5). Sumoylation depends on an activating SAE1/SAE2 E1-enzyme heterodimer, the SUMO conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and recently identified E3 SUMO ligases. In contrast to ubiquitination that targets the conjugated proteins to 26S proteasomemediated degradation, the biological consequences of SUMO modification include nuclear targeting, the formation of subnuclear structures, the regulation of transcriptional activities and the control of protein stability (1,4,6).",

            "text": "The family of ATF7 (formerly ATFa) transcription factors, structurally and functionally related to ATF2, is composed of at least three members (ATF7-1, 2, 3) (7,8) translated from alternatively spliced messengers issued from a single gene (9). Although the three ATF7 isoforms differ by the presence of small motifs within their N-terminal region, they exhibit indistinguishable activities. Their transcriptional activation domain has been delineated within the N-terminal part of the protein and shown to include a critical zinc-binding element and two conserved threonine residues (T51 and T53, corresponding to the T69 and T71 homologs in ATF2) (10,11). This region, together with sequences located in the C-terminal portion of the ATF7 proteins, contributes to their interaction with the adenovirus E1a oncoprotein (8). ATF7, like ATF2, can also associate with c-Jun or c-Fos proteins through their C-terminal leucine-zipper (b-ZIP) region. While ATF proteins usually bind as homodimers to ATF/CRE promoter elements, they also can bind TRE sequences if heterodimerized with members of the Jun family (10,12). ATF7 proteins also strongly interact with the JNK2 protein kinase (13), although they do not constitute substrates for this kinase but rather serve as a JNK2-docking site for ATF7-associated partners like JunD, (11). Collectively, these data suggest that ATF7 proteins play important functions early in cell signaling.",

In this screening only the N-terminal portion of ATF7 lacking the leucine-zipper (b-ZIP) was chosen to avoid potential interactions with other b-ZIPcontaining molecules. Among the selected clones, one corresponded to mBLM, a DNA helicase implied in the Bloom Syndrome disease (30), another one to mAM (29) a recently described protein shown to facilitate conversion from dimethyl to trimethyl lysine 9 of histone H3 by ESET and cause transcriptional repression (31). Interestingly, a third one corresponded to Ubc9, the SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme (32,33). In addition, protein sequence analysis revealed that ATF7 contains a potential sumoylation target site (I-K-X-E) matching the consensus sequence ( Figure 1A) (1,34,35). To investigate whether ATF7 could be sumoylated, we first used an in vitro assay ( Figure 1B). Purified bacterially expressed ATF7 proteins were incubated with a minimal SUMO-1 conjugation system composed of purified recombinant human E1 (SAE1/2), E2 (Ubc9) enzymes and purified mature SUMO-1 (aa 1-97) (36,37). Immunoblot analysis revealed an additional band of slower mobility when the ATF7 protein was the substrate (ATF7WT) but not when its sumoylation site was mutated (ATF7K118R). As a negative control, ATF2, a protein closely related to ATF7 that lacks the consensus sumoylation site ( Figure 1A), was shown not to be sumoylated in this assay ( Figure 1B).",

For this reason, SUMO conjugation is generally investigated using cells overexpressing SUMO proteins. To verify SUMO-1 modification of ATF7 in a cellular context, we thus transfected a human cell line (HeLa-SUMO) that constitutively expresses elevated levels of 6His:Myc:epitope-tagged human SUMO-1 protein (22) with plasmids expressing either the ATF7WT or the K118R derivative ( Figure 1C). Transfected cells were lysed in the presence of SDS and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to inhibit SUMO-specific proteases activity. Cellular extracts were passed over nickel-charged agarose resin (Ni-NTA agarose, Qiagen) to purify 6His:Myc:SUMO-1 conjugated proteins. Analysis of Ni-NTA bound fractions was first performed by immunoblotting using SUMO-1 specific antibodies ( Figure 1C, left panel). Ladders of many SUMO conjugated proteins retained on the Ni-NTA beads could be observed, but interestingly a major band with an apparent molecular weight compatible with that of a mono-sumoylated form of ATF7 was detected only into the cells transfected with ATF7WT. The same blot was and in vitro synthesized 35 S-labeled ATF2 (lanes 5 and 6) were subjected to in vitro SUMO-1 conjugation, as indicated (System refers to the complete assay reaction as described in Materials and Methods-AU refers to arbitrary unit). Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using ATF7 (2F10) monoclonal-antibodies (lanes 1-4) or autoradiography (lanes 5 and 6). (C) HeLa-SUMO cells were transfected with 0.5 mg px-ATF7WT or pXATFK118R. Extracts (500 mg) from transfected cells were passed through Ni-NTA agarose (affinity-purification). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and the presence of sumoylated ATF7, and then ATF7 was revealed by western blotting (WB) using specific antibodies, as indicated. (D) Extracts (500 mg) from Raji cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-ATF7 (2F10) antibodies.

            "text": "Previous studies had correlated SUMO modification with the recruitment of target proteins to specialized subnuclear domains, (1)(2)(3)34,35,38). To address this issue, we transiently expressed ATF7WT and ATF7K118R mutant into HeLa-SUMO cells and followed their intracellular localization by fluorescence microscopy. Immunostaining of transfected cells with anti-ATF7 antibody revealed two patterns of localizations: 90% of the transfected cells mainly showed a nuclear localization for ATF7WT, with a diffuse distribution excluding the nucleoli (Figure 2A) while 10% of the transfected cells showed a distinct pattern restricted to the periphery of the nucleus ( Figure 2B). On the other hand, expression of ATF7K118R proteins that cannot be sumoylated showed exclusively the nucleoplasmic localization pattern ( Figure 2C). These results suggest that sumoylation may trap the protein at the vinicity of the nuclear envelope. In order to check this hypothesis, we engineered a constitutively sumoylated form of ATF7 by covalently attaching SUMO-1 to ATF7 by gene fusion as previously described for Sp3 or TAF5 (25,39). We therefore generated a ATFK118R derivative composed of the protein SUMO-1 (amino acids 1-96) directly fused N-terminus of ATF7. The C-terminal Gly of full-length SUMO-1 was replaced by an Ala in order to prevent cleavage of the fusion proteins by C-terminal SUMO hydrolases (39). As shown in Figure 2D and E, 20% of the cells transfected with this construct displayed an immunofluorescence staining localized at the periphery of the nucleus. This represents a 2-fold increase compared to the number observed with wild-type ATF7. The observation that not all the cells showed such a perinuclear localization pattern suggests that sumoylation may only transiently block the protein at this level.",

Since it has been shown that the nuclear pore complex (NPC) RanBP2 protein strongly enhances SUMO-1 modification of the nuclear body-associated SP100 protein (40) and HDAC4 deacetylase (41), we tested whether this protein could function as a SUMO E3 ligase for ATF7. To verify this hypothesis, our reconstituted in vitro modification assay (see Figure 1) was performed with recombinant ATF7 in the presence or absence of a bacterially produced RanBP2 fusion protein (GST-RanBP2iFG). This truncated protein was previously described to exhibit an E3 ligase activity (40). As shown in Figure 3A, although the sumoylation of ATF7 occurred to some extent in the absence of SUMO ligase (lane 3), the reaction was strongly stimulated by addition of the RanBP2 derivative (lane 5). To confirm the specificity of the assay, we used GST-PIAS1 instead of RanBP2 in a similar in vitro modification experiment. PIAS1 also exhibits E3 ligase activity but directed towards different transcription factors, like c-jun or p53 (42,43).",

Whole cell extracts were then submitted to immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibodies against ATF7 and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by western blotting using anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Figure 3B, RanBP2 was detected in the immunoprecipitates only when coexpressed with the constitutively sumoylated ATF7 construct, but not in the presence of ATF7WT or ATF7K118R. Therefore, these results strongly suggest that sumoylation promotes the interaction between ATF7 and RanBP2, supporting the idea that RanBP2 is the ATF7 specific E3 ligase.

These results indicate that a large part of the WT protein activity is due to its non-sumoylated form. Identical results were obtained with the three ATF7 isomers (9), namely ATF7-1, ATF7-2 and ATF7-3 (not shown).

            "text": "We previously showed that the transcriptional activity of ATF7 is potentiated by expression of TAF12 and that the two proteins are interacting in vivo (14). We investigated the ability of the fusion SUMO-GA-ATF7 and TAF12 proteins to interact within a cellular context. To that end, HeLa-SUMO cells were transfected with plasmids expressing p-hsTAF12 together with px-ATF7, px-ATF7K118R and px-SUMO-GA-ATF7K118R ( Figure 5B). Whole cell extracts were then submitted to immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibodies against ATF7, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by western blotting using anti-TAF12 antibodies. As shown in Figure 5B (lanes 1-4), TAF12 was detected in the immunoprecipitates only when coexpressed with ATF7WT or ATF7K118R, but not when coexpressed with the constitutively sumoylated ATF7 construct. In HeLa-SUMO transfected cells, the majority of the overexpressed ATF7WT protein is not sumoylated. Therefore, these results strongly suggest that sumoylation may prevent the interaction between ATF7 and TAF12, and this loss of interaction would thus account for the transcriptional inhibitory effect of ATF7 sumoylation. To gain some insight into the molecular mechanism of this differential action on transcription, we first performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment on the E-selectin gene. ATF7 has previously been shown to specifically bind to the NF-ELAM1 promoter element of the E-selectin gene and to interact with TAF12 (14). HeLa-SUMO cells were transfected with vectors expressing either ATF7WT, K118R ATF7, or SUMO-GA-ATF7K118R under conditions where equal levels of proteins were expressed, as verified by immunoblotting with specific antibodies ( Figure 6A). We also checked by gel-shift assays that the three proteins were able to bind the NF-ELAM1 promoter element with very similar efficiencies ( Figure 6B). As shown in Figure 6A, the E-selectin promoter was immunoprecipitated more efficently in ATF7K118R expressing cells than in ATF7WT or SUMO-GA-ATF7K118R transfected cells. These results clearly indicate that, in the context of a natural promoter (and in a steady-state level), non-sumoylated ATF7 form is more strongly associated with the chromatin. Therefore sumoylation prevents the association of ATF7 with the target promoter or facilitates its removal in vivo. In addition, a direct measurement of transcription was performed to analyze the changes in an ATF7 target gene expression upon the changes in ATF7 sumoylation. RT-PCR analysis clearly shows that transcription of the E-selectin gene is enhanced in the  presence of ATF7K118R ( Figure 6C) whereas the expression level of the control gene (b-actin) is unaffected. Altogether, these observations clearly confirm the inhibitory effect of sumoylation of ATF7 on the transactivation process: sumoylation not only impairs the interaction between ATF7 and TAF12 but blocks the access of ATF7 to promoters. turnover (for reviews, see References (1,3,35)). In the present article, we demonstrate that the ATF7 transcription factor is sumoylated in vitro and in vivo, and that sumoylation affects its intranuclear localization and its transcriptional activity by impairing the interaction between ATF7 and TAF12, thereby blocking the access of ATF7 to its specific promoters.",

            "text": "Since their discovery, ATF7 and ATF2 although encoded by distinct genes (9,45) have always been described as two closely related proteins, with very similar properties (7,46). For example, the two proteins mediate transactivation by the adenovirus oncoprotein E1a (8,47) and heterodimerize with Jun or Fos proteins (10). They are also phoshorylated by p38 and JNK MAP-kinases (11,48,49) and their transcriptional activity is mediated by TAF12 (14). By contrast, a survey of the protein sequences derived from all sequenced eukaryotic genomes clearly reveals a consensus sumoylation site (fKXE) within all known ATF7 protein sequences, whereas it is absent in all ATF2 proteins. We clearly show here that ATF7, but not ATF2, is sumoylated in vivo at the lysine residue (K118) belonging to this element. Though this sequence is located in the previously described transactivating domain, it is the first time that such a striking difference is observed between the activity of the two proteins. This indicates that, notwithstanding their high functional and structural homologies, these two ATF proteins likely play distinct roles in the cell. It has been suggested that SUMO modification could affect the subcellular localization of proteins (3). As shown for many nuclear proteins, sumoylation can direct some transcription factors to the so-called PML nuclear bodies (50), thus sequestering them away from the DNA and taking them out of action (50)(51)(52). Furthermore, sumoylation can also be coupled with the transport of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (53,54).",

            "text": "As revealed by our localization studies, the wild-type ATF7 (ATF7WT) is dispersed throughout the nucleoplasm in the majority of the cells (about 90%), while it is restricted to a perinuclear distribution in approximately 10% of the cells. The fact that a non-sumoylatable mutant protein (ATF7K118R) never accumulates at the nuclear periphery, strongly suggests that the nucleoplasmic ATF7 corresponds to the non-sumoylated fraction of the protein. On the other hand, the in vivo perinuclear localization is in good agreement with the fact that the ATF7 sumoylation process requires (i) Ubc9, a conjugating enzyme which is associated to both cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in vivo (55), and (ii) the E3 ligase RanBP2, a protein also belonging to the NPC (40). Thus, it appears that the ATF7 localization is affected by sumoylation, as previously reported for other transcription factors, like Sp3 (39), CtBP (56), Elk-1 (57) or SATB2 (58). In the latter case, a very similar correlation between sumoylation and subnuclear localization has also been observed: sumoylated SATB2 was predominantly localized at the nuclear periphery, whereas a sumoylationdeficient SATB2 protein had a more diffuse nuclear localization (58).",

Time laps microscopy further extended our views. Indeed, the stably sumoylated protein takes twice as long as the non-sumoylated form (ATF7K118R) to enter the nucleus and evenly to redistribute over the nucleoplasm. These kinetic experiments strongly suggest that ATF7 sumoylation is a dynamic process that affects its in vivo localization behavior. Thus an equilibrium between the relative amounts of sumoylated and non-sumoylated forms of the protein might exist in the cell.  Where indicated, reactions were further incubated (30 min, 08C) with the anti-ATF7 antibody before loading on the gel. The black arrowhead points to the specific complex and the white one to the supershifted one. (C) Recombinant pX-based vectors (0.5 mg) directing the expression of the various chimeras were transfected into HUVEC-C-cells. Two days later, RNA was isolated and E-selectin mRNA expression was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR method using b-actin as internal control. Ethidium bromide-stained gel is shown in the figure."

            "section": "Sumoylation affects ATF7 transcriptional activity",
            "text": "Besides its contribution to the subcellular localization of ATF7, a functional role for the sumoylation was inferred from the analysis of the SUMO-deficient mutant protein (ATF7K118R). First, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the SUMO-deficient mutant ATF7 derivative associates more efficiently than ATF7WT with the CRE promoter element of the endogenous E-selectin gene. Second, SUMO-deficient ATF7 stimulated expression from a cotransfected reporter plasmid more efficiently than ATF7WT. By contrast, fusion of SUMO to the K118R mutant of ATF7 (as in SUMO-GA-ATF7K118R) resulted in a decrease of its transcriptional activation potential, an observation most likely related to the negative effect of SUMO on the ability of ATF7 to interact with its TAF12 partner. As previously shown, TAF12 potentiates ATF7-induced transcriptional activation through direct interaction with the N-terminal ATF7 transactivation domain (14). It appears therefore that the SUMO modification clearly contributes to the regulation of the ATF7 transcriptional activity by impairing the interaction between ATF7 and TAF12. Interestingly, both TAF5 and TAF12-TFIID subunitshave been shown to be sumoylated (25). However, only SUMO conjugation of TAF5 interferes with binding of TFIID to promoter DNA, whereas modification of TAF12 has no detectable effect in this respect. Furthermore, SUMO conjugation has also no detectable effect on nuclear import or intranuclear distribution of these two TAFs. Clearly sumoylation may differentially affect proteins involved in a same function, i.e. transactivation of target genes. It is difficult to directly correlate the functional differences observed between native ATF7WT and its non-sumoylatable counterpart (ATF7K118R), in terms of transcriptional activity or occupation of its target promoters, with their actual respective sumoylation levels. Indeed, the action of endogenous SUMO proteases (Senp1 and/or 2), released into the cell extracts, likely alters the apparent proportion of sumoylated proteins. This is best illustrated in Figure 5, where ATF7WT and ATF7K118R exhibit significantly different transcriptional and promoter binding activities (panels A and D), while showing equally low levels of sumoylation, compared to the Senp-resistant SUMO-GA-ATF7K118R derivative (panel B). A model has recently been proposed (4), in which the pool of sumoylated transcription factors constitutes a built-in portion of more general transcriptional repression complexes. Within these structures, factors could be desumoylated while remaining associated with the complex of repression, independent of SUMO. Thus, SUMO would be required to initiate but not to maintain repression (4). However, upon sustained desumoylation, the overall number of repression complexes might ultimately decrease. Such a scenario has been described in the case of the Elk-1 transcription factor whose phosphorylation by MAP-kinases is concomitant with its desumoylation and the activation of transcription (59). The fact that transcriptional activity of ATF7 is enhanced when the p38 MAP-kinase pathway is stimulated supports this model. Consequently, it would be advisable to check the relationships between phosphorylation and sumo/desumoylation of ATF7.",
