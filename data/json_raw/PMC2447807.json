In this cascade, biogenesis of ta-siRNA clusters requires 21-nt intervals (i.e. phasing) and miRNA (phase-initiator) cleavage sites on its TAS transcript. Here, we report a novel web server, pssRNAMiner, which is developed to identify both the clusters of phased small RNAs as well as the potential phase-initiator. To detect phased small RNA clusters, the pssRNAMiner maps input small RNAs against user-specified transcript/ genomic sequences, and then identifies phased small RNA clusters by evaluating P-values of hypergeometric distribution. To identify potential phaseinitiators, pssRNAMiner aligns input phase-initiators with transcripts of TAS candidates using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. Potential cleavage sites on TAS candidates are further identified from complementary regions by weighting the alignment expectation and its distance to detected phased small RNA clusters. The pssRNAMiner web server is freely available at http://bioinfo3.noble.org/pssRNAMiner/.",

            "text": "The ta-siRNA, a newly identified class of 21-nt short siRNAs, play an essential role in bridging the miRNA and siRNA pathways, which were previously believed to be two independent processes (2)(3)(4)(5). Phase-initiators direct the cleavage of ta-siRNA gene (TAS) primary transcripts (precursors) and subsequently initiate the production of ta-siRNA clusters (4). To date, only a few known phase-initiators are ta-siRNAs as most of reported phaseinitiators are miRNAs. Following cleavage of the precursor, the 3 0 (or 5 0 )-cleavage products are converted into double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by RDR6 and SGS3. The dsRNA is then processed into 21-nt increments, relative to the original cleavage site on both strands, by DCL4 in order to produce ta-siRNA clusters (3,4). The ta-siRNAs form an essential component of the RISC complex responsible for guiding AGO-dependent cleavage of the target transcript. Based on these data, several researchers have proposed a 'miRNA ! ta-siRNA ! target gene' cleavage cascade as an element of gene regulatory network in the model plant Arabidopsis (4-7). In this paper, we describe the development of the pssRNAMiner, a plant short small RNA regulatory cascade analysis server that is able to identify potential ta-siRNAs clusters and their phase-initiators.",

Therefore, as compared to miRNA, there is no effective computational approach to identify siRNAs from either genomic or transcript sequence. Since 21-nt phased ta-siRNAs are generated from TAS precursors, it is possible to map known small RNA molecules to candidate TAS precursors and then cluster these small RNAs based on their 21-nt phase properties (8,9).

            "text": "Finally, to evaluate the performance of pssRNAMiner, we downloaded RDR small RNA MPSS libraries from the  Arabidopsis MPSS Plus database (http://mpss.udel.edu/ at/) (13,14). A total of 11 767 distinct small RNA signatures were analyzed based on the Arabidopsis TAIR7 cDNA release (ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/ TAIR7_genome_release/). When these data were investigated, pssRNAMiner detected 124 significantly phased small RNA clusters (P < 0.005) at 19 gene loci. Moreover, pssRNAMiner detected all the reported ta-siRNA gene loci with significant P-value, including TAS1a (AT2G27400), TAS1b (AT1G50055), TAS1c (AT2G39675), TAS2 (AT2G39681), TAS3a (AT3G17185) and PPR proteins (AT1G63080 and AT1G63130) (see Supplementary Material for the list of detected phased RNA clusters and gene loci). To investigate the ability of pssRNAMiner to identify valid cleavage site of phase-initiators, a reported phase-initiator, miRNA 'ath-miR390', was submitted for cleavage site analysis on TAS candidate precursors. The pssRNAMiner reported two complementary regions (expectation 5) with one region having a valid cleavage site on TAS3a. These results are consistent with previously published studies that demonstrated that the ath-miR390 initiates production of phased small RNA clusters on TAS3a by guiding precursor cleavage (2,4) (see detailed alignment in the Supplementary Material).",
