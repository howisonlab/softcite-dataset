            "text": "Diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent in the USA. 1 Diabetes research has produced clear evidence that blood glucose, lipid and blood pressure (BP) control forestall the vascular complications witnessed with uncontrolled diabetes. Thus, control of such diabetes care measures are well-accepted indicators-as intermediate process outcomes of high quality of care, 2 3 However, diabetes care measures of their appropriate control lag behind; only 7% of diabetes patients in USA meet the American Diabetes Association recommendations for glycated haemoglobin (A1c), BP and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) control. 4 Furthermore, diabetes is more endemic in the Southern USA and individuals with diabetes in this area have worse control. [5][6][7][8] Hence, public health interventions, which consider distance barriers in rural setting and aimed at improving diabetes control in patients living in rural areas, are warranted. [9][10][11] The Rural Diabetes Online Care (R-DOC) study was a rigorously tested cluster-randomised clinical trial comparing a multicomponent physician intervention including web-based continuous medical education (CME), performance feedback [12][13][14] and quality improvement tools 13 to a concurrent control website in rural Southeast USA. 15 The primary outcomes were measures of acceptable and optimal control for A1c, BP and LDL; the secondary outcomes were process measures (rate of assessment and group means of A1c, BP and LDL). Despite the nonsignificant effect attributable to the intervention for any of the primary outcomes in the R-DOC study, we observed an absolute increase in the rates of assessment of A1c and LDL in both study arms (A1c, intervention 30%, control 29%, p<0.001; LDL, intervention 35%, control 38%, p=0.05). 15 However, whether physicians in rural areas adjust medications to control A1c, BP or LDL has not been examined in wide-reach, low-intensity interventions [9][10][11] such as the one utilised in the R-DOC study.",

[15][16][17][18] Briefly, participants were family, general and internal medicine physicians located in rural areas of 11 Southeastern US states (population size <25 000 habitants). Physicians were enrolled in the study sequentially from September 2006 to September 2008, provided informed consent online, and were randomised to the intervention or control arms using block randomisation which was concealed to the investigators and statisticians. The unit of randomisation was the physician (and not a practice); however, for physicians working in a group practice, only one physician per practice could enrol in the study. The protocol was approved by the local institutional review boards at The University of Alabama at Birmingham and Tuscaloosa medical campuses.",

The relationship between the main and secondary outcomes and the effect of the intervention were examined with generalied linear mixed models (GLMM), accounting for clustering of patients within physicians. ORs for follow-up versus baseline within the two groups were calculated, adjusting for covariates that differed between baseline and follow-up patient populations; thus, the covariates included in these adjusted analyses included race, and clinical diagnosis of hypertension or depression. GLMM was implemented by PROC GLIMMIX in SAS and was adjusted for race, and clinical diagnosis of hypertension or depression. Thus, the group coefficient represented differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline; the time of coefficient represented changes in the control group over time, thus capturing temporal trends. Finally, the group-by-time interaction coefficient represented the difference-of-differences for over-time change in the intervention versus control group, and was a direct comparison of over-time change for the intervention versus the control group. A positive OR meant that the odds of a patient being in control increased more over time for the intervention versus control group.

However, the absolute rate of intensification of medications to control A1c increased in both study arms at the end of the study by a modest amount (\u223c6%). Although the study was not designed to perform subgroup analysis, the rate of intensification was greatest among the worst-controlled patients (A1c >9%) in both study arms (\u223c25-28%). Plausible explanations for our findings include the low engagement with the intervention, higher-than anticipated attrition rate, Hawthorne's effect or no effect of the intervention 15 18 Medication intensification is emerging as a process measure for quality improvement efforts among patients with diabetes mellitus; pharmacotherapy intensification is strongly linked to improved A1c, BP and LDL. For example, in a study of over one million members with hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes mellitus at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Selby et al 21 found that a 5% improvement in treatment intensification led to a 1.0-1.9% improvement in control for the entire population. However, the association of treatment intensification rates to improved risk factor control in rural populations has not been examined. Further evidence and reviews of the importance of medication intensification among patients with diabetes are available elsewhere [22][23][24][25][26][27] .",

[9][10][11] The components of the framework include reach ('How many participate?'), effectiveness ('Does it work in usual settings?'), adoption ('How many use it?'), implementation ('Is it used as intended?') and maintenance ('Is it sustained over time?') (RE-AIM). In this study, using a wide-reach approach, we examined the effectiveness of a potential public health intervention. Effective interventions may be limited by their low-reach, specificity to fewer settings, expense and limited sustainability-thus limiting their generalisability. Testing less intensive interventions with wider reach in rural settings has been advocated in public health interventions. 11 Finding effective strategies to accomplish continuing professional development for physicians practising in remote locations is also an important objective. 31 In contrast, higher-intensity interventions in rural and community settings have shown promising results.

Despite low engagement in the web-based programme, intensification measures improved in both arms of the study. Our study raises important issues for wide-reach, low-intensity CME programmes that seek to improve patient outcomes."
