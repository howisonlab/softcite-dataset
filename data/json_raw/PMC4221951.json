            "text": "Objective: To evaluate how an online toolkit may support ePrescribing deployments in National Health Service hospitals, by assessing the type of knowledge-based resources currently sought by key stakeholders. Design: Questionnaire-based survey of attendees at a national ePrescribing symposium. Setting: 2013 National ePrescribing Symposium in London, UK. Participants: Eighty-four delegates were eligible for inclusion in the survey, of whom 70 completed and returned the questionnaire. Main outcome measures: Estimate of the usefulness and type of content to be included in an ePrescribing toolkit. Results: Interest in a toolkit designed to support the implementation and use of ePrescribing systems was high (n \u00bc 64; 91.4%). As could be expected given the current dearth of such a resource, few respondents (n \u00bc 2; 2.9%) had access or used an ePrescribing toolkit at the time of the survey. Anticipated users for the toolkit included implementation (n \u00bc 62; 88.6%) and information technology (n \u00bc 61; 87.1%) teams, pharmacists (n \u00bc 61; 87.1%), doctors (n \u00bc 58; 82.9%) and nurses (n \u00bc 56; 80.0%). Summary guidance for every stage of the implementation (n \u00bc 48; 68.6%), planning and monitoring tools (n \u00bc 47; 67.1%) and case studies of hospitals' experiences (n \u00bc 45; 64.3%) were considered the most useful types of content. Conclusions: There is a clear need for reliable and up-todate knowledge to support ePrescribing system deployments and longer term use. The findings highlight how a toolkit may become a useful instrument for the management of knowledge in the field, not least by allowing the exchange of ideas and shared learning.",

            "text": "Despite growing interest in and financial support for the deployment of ePrescribing systems [1][2][3][4] that offer varying degrees of functionality in the supply, administration, recording and prescribing of medication, 4 there is relatively little experience of implementing and using these systems in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK. [4][5][6] The recently announced NHS 'Safer Wards, Safer Hospitals Technology Fund' 7 marks the beginning of a \u00a31 billion investment in Information Technology (IT) over the next three years by the UK government and NHS organisations and provides strong evidence of the policy drive to support the establishment of health IT systems across NHS hospitals. This push for the digitisation of NHS hospitals has been driven by expectations that the introduction of new IT systems, or eHealth systems, may increase safety, [8][9][10] organisational efficiency in the delivery of care and medication, 11 as well as improved communication, 2,12 both within the hospital and between primary and secondary care settings. Efforts to establish paper-light environments across the NHS risk, however, being hampered by the lack of experience and knowledge of implementing eHealth systems in NHS hospitals. 6,13 Appropriate knowledge-based support may go some way to addressing the immaturity of the UK eHealth landscape. The NHS Connecting for Health Programme has until recently provided an authoritative online resource to help promote and deliver eHealth services across the NHS, 14 including ePrescribing. Many of these resources have now migrated to the Health and Social Care Information system portal, 15 a gateway to a wider range of health informatics-related data and material. The availability and use of such knowledge is essential to support an organisation's ability to change and innovate. 16,17 It also facilitates the transfer and exchange of knowledge between research and practice and is a key underpinning of successful eHealth deployments. 18,19 In line with such understandings, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has commissioned us to undertake a programme of research evaluating the implementation and adoption of ePrescribing systems in English hospitals. Part of this has included the development of a toolkit 13 that reflects the various stages and associated needs of users to successfully deploy, use and integrate a hospital ePrescribing system. Building on the preliminary recommendations made in earlier work, 13 a study was designed to guide the subsequent toolkit prototype development. Since it is now well established that user involvement and participatory design are absolute requisites in the planning and design of userfriendly learning technologies and resources, 20,21 the study sought to map participants' information and knowledge needs in relation to ePrescribing implementation and adoption, in order to support the toolkit's usability. We report here on findings from this study.",

Second, it was suggested that supporting local needs through the use of a toolkit may be complicated by an aspiration to provide generic support to all hospitals in England, aiming to implement an ePrescribing system. This tension between a designed-for-all toolkit versus one addressing local needs was further echoed in requests for content to be tailored to specific areas, sectors and specialities. Third, there was demand for   a toolkit that is up-to-date in its content and application. Novel uses, including interactive and visual capabilities, such as in situ simulation training or videos to provide visual support, were cited. Constantly updated material relating to technical and infrastructure guidance, as well as evaluation and audit requirements, were also highlighted as particularly important areas.",

            "text": "The findings from this study suggest a high degree of interest in developing a toolkit to support the roll-out of ePrescribing systems in NHS hospitals. This should be of little surprise given the relatively nascent state of ePrescribing deployments in NHS hospitals and the patchy knowledge and unproven track-record of many hospitals implementing and adopting ePrescribing systems. The complexity and lengthy timescales needed to implement EHRs and associated challenges 6,22 clearly align stakeholders' needs to those of the aims of the toolkit. We should also be mindful when interpreting these findings of the study's limitations, notably the use of a convenience sample that had a relative over-representation of pharmacists (even if not atypical for such a study given this group's early involvement in ePrescribing projects) 4,23 as well as the low levels of use of existing ePrescribing support websites reported by the respondents. That said, we believe representatives from the majority of hospitals who are either planning to implement or have implemented ePrescribing systems attended this national event. Furthermore, the limited range of participants is a reminder of the need and opportunity for the toolkit to act as a vehicle for wider engagement with all those involved in the use of ePrescribing from patients right through to the Trust Board. The study's findings underline the demand for a toolkit that provides highly practical resources to help plan ePrescribing deployments as well as support their continued use, to a broad base of users. Such findings mirror the calls made by MacFarlane et al. 19 who conclude in their work that there is indeed an immediate need to address 'the translational gap by developing tools . . . to promote implementation . . . in the field of eHealth'. The considerable interest in ensuring the toolkit can become both a practical resource centre, as well as a repository for ePrescribing knowledge and research in the UK and internationally, may go some way to help achieve this, by supporting improved knowledge exchange [16][17][18] in the field. Notwithstanding such aims, the study demonstrates how content is only one aspect of this exchange of knowledge: how ideas and expertise are shared and used matters too. The real value of the toolkit will thus come from its actual use, and further research is needed to evaluate how valuable this toolkit will become once in use, and whether support mechanisms such as mentoring could further promote applying usefully expert knowledge.",

            "text": "The toolkit's potential role in helping address the knowledge gap facing hospitals in their deployment of ePrescribing systems is significant. This study has arguably provided a better understanding of users' needs and aspirations for the toolkit which will enable it to offer a suitable range of resources to facilitate the introduction and longer term integration of ePrescribing systems. While helpful for the further elaboration of the tools and content of the toolkit itself, this is only a first step. Indeed the online and publicly accessible prototype of the ePrescribing toolkit 24 that this work has supported will now need to be further evaluated and critiqued by its users. It also remains essential for future work in this area to involve a broader base of ePrescribing knowledge users than those surveyed in this study. More attention will need to be paid in particular to groups, such as patients, whose knowledge needs have not been clearly addressed so far, and to establishing the best ways to reach out and engage with those who are at present not closely involved in the implementation and adoption of ePrescribing systems.
