            "text": "The last 30 years have seen a proliferation of international bilateral or plurilateral agreements covering the flows of trade, investment and people. While the scope of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) tends to be the widest, with currently around 300 PTAs in force and each PTA having an average of around 12 members (see WTO, 2011), Bilateral investment treaties (BITs) have also increased in popularity. At the end of the 1960s, there were only 75 BITs in force. This increased to 167 by the end of the 1970s, and 389 by the end of the 1980s. Today, there are 2,954 BITs in existence, with 2,319 in force, and 362 other investment agreements (with 293 in force). 1 Investment agreements have become an important policy tool with many proposed deep PTAs including an investment chapter (e.g., the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), EU-Canada, EU-India). 2 Understanding their impact both on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and on economic performance more generally is therefore an important issue.",

            "text": "The aim of BITs is to encourage flows of FDI from generally high-income suppliers to lowerincome recipients. FDI is expected to benefit host countries through a number of channels. In addition to the inflow of capital, FDI is often accompanied by the movement of firm-specific assets such as technology, managerial ability, corporate governance and access to networks connecting foreign markets. FDI is also expected to encourage competition among domestic firms, hopefully increasing efficiency. Spillovers from FDI may also be expected through the leakage of proprietary knowledge (see G\u20ac org and Greenaway, 2004 for a review). These potential gains from FDI lie behind the decision of policymakers in developing countries to sign BITs, despite such agreements impinging on their national sovereignty (Elkins, Guzman, & Simmons, 2004;Guzman, 1998;Neumayer, 2005).",

Most controversially, BIT parties agree to be bound by dispute settlement provisions that are intended to ensure basic requirements of credible protection of property and contract rights, but which often result in foreign investors being granted greater security and better treatment than domestic investors (Vandevelde, 1998). 3 The investor settlement procedure potentially involves considerable interference in domestic policy, with practically any public policy being subject to challenge. 4 For individual hosts, there are likely to be benefits from being able to provide credible commitments to investors, which can lead to a competitive advantage as long as not all potential hosts have signed such treaties. The costs of BITs can generally be justified if the outcome of the BIT is to increase FDI inflows, and if these FDI inflows provide the benefits discussed above.",

Empirical research addressing the impact of BITs on FDI flows 5 generally adopts one of two approaches. Some studies explain bilateral flows of FDI, usually estimating a gravity-type equation and including as one of its arguments a dummy variable for country-pairs that have a BIT. Others move away from a bilateral focus and examine whether countries that sign BITs see an increase in aggregate FDI inflows. While, in principle, BITs only protect investors from the signatory states to whom binding commitments have been made, their existence may also signal to potential investors elsewhere that this host country protects the interests of foreign investors more generally. If this is the case, then BITs encourage FDI inflows from both BIT partners and non-BIT sources.",

Controlling for country size and other country-specific factors, she finds no direct evidence that the existence of a BIT between a developed and a developing country increases the flow of FDI to the latter. If interactions between the BIT dummy and measures of institutional quality are included, however, the estimated coefficients are positive and often significant, a result implying that BITs are complementary to institutional quality. Perhaps BITs might seem credible in an environment of good institutional quality. Alternatively, as noted earlier, BITs might substitute for host institutional quality by providing a certain standard of treatment to foreign investors where domestic institutions fail to do so. 6 An example of the aggregate approach is Tobin and Rose-Ackerman (2005) who examine 5 year averages of aggregate FDI inflows for 63 countries over the period 1980-2000. They find that a higher number of BITs (either in total or signed with a high-income country) lowers the share of global FDI a high-risk country receives, but raises the FDI share for low-risk countries, results consistent with a complementary relationship between BITs and institutional quality. Neumayer and Spess (2005) follow a similar approach, using aggregate FDI inflows to individual 3 Through this mechanism foreign investors can avoid national legal systems, opting instead for international arbitration, where they can choose one of the three panellists, and where consensus is required for one of the other two (Elkins et al., 2004). Recently, there has been a strong increase in the number of arbitration cases (Bellak, 2013) and the presence of international arbitrage clauses has caused concern amongst citizens in the EU regarding the proposed TTIP agreement.",

This variable is related to the cumulative number of BITs signed with developed countries (weighted by their share in total OECD FDI) and other explanatory variables. Their results indicate that a higher number of BITs raises FDI to developing countries, a result that is robust to changes in model specification, estimation technique and sample size. The authors also report some evidence suggesting that BITs might act as substitutes for good domestic institutional quality, although this result is not robust to alternative specifications of institutional quality. 7 Whatever the approach adopted, the evidence from this literature is mixed. Some estimated coefficients are negative (e.g., Gil-Pareja, Llorca-Vivero, & Paniagua, 2013;Tobin & Rose-Ackerman, 2011); some are insignificant (e.g. Blonigen & Davies, 2004); and others are positive (e.g., Neumayer & Spess, 2005). Bellak (2013) summarises much of the empirical literature, undertaking a meta-analysis showing that 11% of the estimated coefficients on the BIT dummy are actually negative (2% being significantly so), with 76% of the coefficients being positive and significant. In addition, he finds that more recent studies have been more likely to find a negative coefficient and that the dispersion of the estimated coefficients has tended to increase over time. Bellak (2013) reports an un-weighted mean semi-elasticity of 17.6% in the papers he considers, but the standard deviation is found to be 37.4 with some estimates above 100% and others below \u00c050%.",

BIT formation was treated as exogenous, with country-pairs implicitly assumed to be randomly assigned into BITs, rather than self-selecting into them. Recent work by Bergstrand and Egger (2013) has shown that the economic fundamentals often found to determine FDI flows are also determinants of BIT membership. This can lead to a self-selection bias in the estimated impact of BITs on FDI flows. Some existing studies do control for this endogeneity, with Aisbett (2009), for example, using country-pair fixed effects in a model of bilateral FDI to control for self-selection and finding that their inclusion reduces the coefficient on the BIT dummy and renders it insignificant. In contrast, Busse, K\u20ac oniger, and Nunnenkamp (2010) and Kerner (2009) use an instrumental variables (IV) approach to control for endogeneity and still find a positive and significant impact of BITs on FDI inflows. Their data are not restricted to positive FDI flows. 8 This paper extends the existing literature in two main ways. First, we adopt an explicit difference-in-difference (DiD) approach to identify a causal effect of the formation of new-BITs on bilateral FDI flows. The DiD approach allows for unobserved differences in treated and non-treated observations and thus controls for the potential self-selection of country-pairs in forming a BIT. In",

Berger, Busse, Nunnenkamp, and Roy (2013) consider the guarantees of market access provided by means of national treatment and most-favoured-nation treatment in the pre-establishment phase; and credible commitments against discriminatory and discretionary treatment provided by international dispute settlement mechanisms in the postestablishment phase. They conclude that liberal admission rules promote bilateral FDI, but that dispute settlement provisions play only a minor role. In related work, Myburgh and Paniagua (2016) show that the effect of a host country increasing access to international commercial arbitration (by signing the Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards) has a positive effect on FDI. This effect largely works through the size rather than the number of investment projects. Two recent papers have looked at the effects of disputes and international arbitration. Allee and Peinhardt (2011) show that FDI flows to a developing host country decline if it is brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. Aisbett, Busse, and Nunnenkamp (2016) consider the effects of disputes and arbitration settlements on FDI flows from BIT partner and non-partner countries. They find that BITs signed before any dispute involving the host country have a positive impact on bilateral FDI flows; that bilateral FDI flows from unprotected sources fall less than those from BIT-partners following a dispute and that the FDI boost a host receives from ratifying another BIT is smaller if it has been involved in a dispute. this respect, Aisbett (2009) is the work most closely related to ours, as her use of country-pair and time fixed effects, as well as country-pair time-trends in some cases, creates a difference-in-difference type estimator. She found, as we do, that once endogeneity had been controlled for there is no evidence of a statistically significant effect of BIT formation on FDI flows at the positive intensive margin. But her approach did not permit explicit consideration of the extensive and negative intensive margins. We also combine the DiD approach with matching to control for observed differences in characteristics between BIT and non-BIT country-pairs. Second, and most importantly, we distinguish between the impact of BITs on existing FDI relationships between countries (i.e., the intensive margin) and their impact in creating new FDI relationships (i.e., the extensive margin), finding that the development of new FDI relationships and the reinvigoration of deteriorating FDI relationships are the important sources of the observed increase in FDI in response to BIT formation. The econometric approach that we adopt follows very closely the study of Egger, Egger, and Greenaway (2008), in which the authors use a DiD analysis of the effects of PTA formation on (intra-industry) trade based on narrow windows either side of the PTA signing. This approach has the advantage of allowing us to examine whether BITs work along both the extensive and intensive margins.",

The method is particularly useful when the sample of untreated individuals may not provide an appropriate control group. In such a case, differences in the outcome between treated and untreated will reflect the effects of treatment, but also of other intrinsic differences between the two groups. Difference-in-difference relies on the common trend assumption, which states that in the absence of treatment the average difference in the outcome variable between the two groups would have stayed roughly constant, meaning that the average difference in outcomes between the two groups prior to treatment can be used to approximate that part of the difference in the average outcomes after the treatment that is due to intrinsic differences between the two groups. 9",

To get a sense of whether this might be an issue for our analysis, we calculated the average growth rate over the previous 8 years of FDI flows for country-pairs that formed a BIT and for those that did not (and were not already in a BIT) for each year over the period [1993][1994][1995][1996][1997][1998][1999][2000][2001][2002][2003]. While the growth rate of FDI in the previous 8 years was higher for new-BIT country-pairs than for non-BIT country-pairs in the majority of years (7 of 11), a simple t test reveals that these differences are not statistically significant. Figure 1 provides a graphical illustration of the standard DiD estimator. In the initial period (t1), FDI for the treated and untreated groups is given by the average pre-agreement FDI levels, PAFDI\u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de and PAFDI\u00f0BIT \u00bc 0\u00de respectively. Assuming a common trend, the corresponding outcomes in the second period (t2) would be given by SAFDI 0 \u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de and SAFDI\u00f0BIT \u00bc 0\u00de, if the effect of the treatment was zero. In the case pictured, the actual value of FDI in period t2 for the treated group is given by SAFDI\u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de, with the distance SAFDI\u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de \u00c0 SAFDI 0 \u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de then representing the estimated treatment effect.

Egger et al. (2008), for example, find that the treatment effects of PTAs are downward biased by around 50% when relying on a simple DiD analysis. To consider this possibility, we adopt a second component of their work and combine DiD with propensity score matching to undertake a matched-DiD analysis. 13 Matching allows us to compare outcomes for treated and control observations that are similar in terms of their observable characteristics, and when combined with DiD potentially provides strong evidence of the causal effects of BITs on FDI flows by accounting for both observed and unobserved differences between BIT members and non-members.",

Few studies to date consider this issue, although Egger and Merlo (2012) report some evidence of the impact of BITs on the two margins using firm-level data for Germany. They base their arguments on recent models of heterogeneous firms (e.g., Melitz, 2003), with the signing of a BIT between two countries expected to lower the entry costs associated with FDI, thereby causing new firms to undertake FDI in the BIT partner (i.e., the extensive margin) and encouraging existing multinationals to increase production (i.e., the intensive margin). Using data on the foreign activity of German multinationals, they find evidence suggesting that BITs work along both margins, with the results suggesting that the signing of a BIT increases the number of German firms active in a typical host by around 10%. Paniagua, Figueiredo, and Sapena (2015) decompose bilateral FDI flows into the number of investments projects and the average size of an investment in each flow. Using data on bilateral firm-level greenfield investments from 120 source countries to 161 host countries over the period 2003-12, they apply a quantile regression in a gravity framework. They conclude that a BIT can have a positive effect but only for average FDI levels above the median. 17 Given our focus on aggregate data, our hypothesis and argumentation is somewhat different. To the extent that BITs act as a means of substituting for weak domestic institutions in the host, then we would expect that multinational firms concerned about weak domestic institutions would not invest (or would withdraw previous investments) in that country without the protection of a BIT.",

It also allows for a comparison of the meta-analysis results in Bellak (2013). Unfortunately, a routine application of the log transformation will exclude from consideration the large number of zero flows along with the negative values of FDI flows which involve instances of reverse or disinvestment. Furthermore, in our DiD analysis, where we use the difference in the log of the average values of FDI between two time periods, all observations in which FDI changed from zero (or a negative value) to some positive number following the formation of a BIT would be excluded. 20 This would exclude precisely those cases where we suspect a BIT might have the greatest impact, as well as leading to the possibility of sample selection bias. To deal with this problem, we make use of the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (for more 18 Obviously, within a northern country some MNCs may choose to undertake FDI, while others choose not to.

            "text": "In the analysis that follows we consider FDI flows from a sample of 22 OECD source countries (i.e., the \"North\") to a sample of up to 110 host countries (i.e., the \"South\"). 22 We consider unidirectional flows from the North to the South, with up to 2,420 observations per year. 23 Flows of FDI have grown more rapidly than trade for much of the last three decades. FDI inflows were around $400 million in 1995, $1.4 trillion in 2000 and, following slumps in the early 2000s and the recent global crisis, rose to $1.45 trillion in 2013 (UNCTAD, 2014). In our analysis, we use the OECD's International Investment Statistics, which report data on bilateral FDI flows (inflows and outflows) for OECD reporting countries and a much larger sample of partner countries from 1982 onwards. Since we use data on the 5 years prior to and subsequent to a particular year in the DiD analysis, we are restricted to the years 1990-2006 for our regression analysis. In our analysis, we use data on deflated FDI outflows from the North to the South, with the values of current FDI reported in the OECD data set being deflated by the GDP deflator of the OECD source country. 24 Data on BITs are taken from UNCTAD's Investment Policy Hub (http://investmentpolicyhub. unctad.org/IIA), with data on ratified BITs being used in the subsequent analysis. 25 To give some indication of how important BITs have become in our data set, Figure 2 reports, by year, data on the frequency of new-BIT formation and the share of potential country-pairs (i.e., the maximum of 2,420) that are subject to a BIT. The figure shows that just 7% of country-pairs were subject to a BIT in 1985. Throughout the period considered, however, and during the 1990s and early 2000s in particular, a large number of new-BITs were agreed (an average of 44.5 per year during the 1990s and 41.8 over the period 2000-05). 26 By the end of the period therefore, around 40% of the country-pairs were subject to a BIT. One implication of this figure is that country-pairs subject to BITs are not a unique, select group, although the share of country-pairs forming a new-BIT each period is on average low, being just 1.2%.",

New-BIT country-pairs tend to experience larger changes in their combined GDP, are more likely to form a PTA following BIT formation and form more BITs with other countries. For other variables (e.g., GDP similarity, KURatio, KUDiff, the similarity variables and the change in political constraints), there is less evidence of a significant difference in the average change in these variables, although often there remain significant differences in distributions between new-BIT and non-BIT members. Overall, these descriptive results point to significant differences between the non and new-BIT countrypairs, which justifies the use of the DiD approach. 31 The DiD estimator relies on the assumption that the outcome variable follows a common trend in the pre-treatment period for the treated and control groups. One test of the common trend assumption is to run a regression of FDI flows on time fixed-effects, individual fixed-effects and interactions of the time fixed effects with the treatment (BIT) indicator (excluding the interaction for the period immediately prior to BIT formation). A test of whether the interaction terms for the pre-BIT period are jointly zero is then a test of a common trend (i.e., there are no significant differences in the difference in the intercept for treated and non-treated observations prior to treatment). We estimate such a model using the average values of FDI for non and new-BIT country-pairs for 8-year windows each side of BIT formation. Combining data for each year between 1993 and 2003 gives us 352 observations, with 16 time periods (eight pre and eight post-BIT formation) and 22 individuals (i.e., an individual is considered the average of either the treated or untreated country-pairs in each of the 11 years). Estimating this regression results in coefficients on the interaction terms in the pre-BIT period that are neither jointly nor individually significant, thus providing evidence in favour of the common trend assumption.",

We then combine the data for the different years and calculate the average value of FDI flows for treated and non-treated country-pairs in the year that a BIT was formed and for each of the 8 years either side of the new-BIT. Finally, we create an index with the value of FDI flows equal to 100 for the non-BIT group in the year that a new-BIT was formed and compare the values to those for the new-BIT group. The resulting figure provides information on the developments in FDI prior to and following the formation of new-BITS, both for the country-pairs that formed BITs and the comparison group that did not. Figure 3 indicates that FDI flows increased relatively rapidly for new-BIT country-pairs following entry into a BIT, which is suggestive of there being a relationship between BIT formation and FDI flows. More importantly however, the figure also suggests that the trend in FDI for new-BIT and non-BIT country-pairs looks fairly similar prior to BIT formation. There is some evidence to suggest a relative decline in FDI flows for new-BIT pairs 5 years prior to BIT formation and perhaps more interestingly an increase in FDI preceding the entering into force of the new-BIT, which may have been a response to the expectation of BIT formation. This is something we return to in our robustness tests. But this aside, Figure 3, along with the more formal econometric test, suggests that the assumption of a common trend existing prior to new-BIT formation cannot be rejected.",

Before turning to these results it is necessary to discuss the results from the initial matching analysis. The dependent variable in the probit analysis is equal to one if a country-pair formed a BIT in time t and zero otherwise. 32 The set of explanatory variables we use are those described above, but rather than using the change between two periods we use the (average) values in the 5 years prior to year t, i.e., the initial values. Since we use the level rather than the change in these explanatory variables we are also able to include country-pair specific variables, such as distance, common language and a common border. The explanatory variables are therefore grounded in the theoretical model of Bergstrand and Egger (2007) and subsequently used by Bergstrand and Egger (2013). Our assumption is that once these characteristics have been controlled for, country-pairs are effectively randomly assigned to the BIT and non-BIT groups. We estimate the probit model for the full sample of observations, matching a BIT country-pair to any non-treated observation based on the set of explanatory variables, irrespective of the initial value of FDI in the non-treated country-pair (i.e., treated observations along a particular margin can be matched to non-treated observations across any margin).",

This is largely for illustrative purposes, but allows us to compare our Probit results with those of Bergstrand and Egger (2013). In general, the sign of the coefficients that we find are similar to those of Bergstrand and Egger,32 Our approach is slightly different to Bergstrand and Egger (2013) in that they were interested in the probability that a country-pair had a BIT at a particular point in time, rather than in the probability that they formed a BIT at a particular point in time. with positive coefficients reported on the sum and similarity of country-pairs' GDPs, on KUDiff, Ssim, and political stability. Consistent with Bergstrand and Egger we find negative coefficients on the log of distance and on the common border dummy. In general therefore, the results from the probit model show a great deal of consistency with those of Bergstrand and Egger.

Second, we have shown above in Figure 2 that country-pairs that join a BIT are not a specific, select group of observations. While in a typical year, the number of country-pairs joining a BIT is relatively small (around 1.2%), over the period of our study around 33% of country-pairs in our sample formed a BIT. Third, we use the theoretical model of Bergstrand and Egger (2007) to construct the counterfactual, which provides an appropriate framework for selecting the control group. Finally, we show that there is little evidence of statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups for all the conditioning characteristics.",

            "text": "We now turn to the results when considering the different margins, with Table 3 reporting results from both the matched and unmatched samples. In considering BIT events along the three different margins we find disparate outcomes. The first four columns report results for the positive intensive margin (i.e., for country-pairs for which FDI flows were positive prior to BIT formation). Coefficients on the BIT variable in this case are consistently negative and, in the matched sample, are significant. These results thus suggest that forming a BIT between country-pairs where FDI was already growing has at best an insignificant effect and at worst a negative impact upon FDI flows. In contrast, we find large, positive and significant coefficients on the BIT dummy in the case of BIT events along the negative intensive margin-i.e., in country-pairs that formed a BIT after a period of disinvestment (the middle four columns of Table 3). The coefficients in this case suggest an increase in FDI flows due to BIT formation of more than 10,000%. 34 Outlandishly large though this seems, it does suggest at least that large reversals in FDI outflows can be achieved if investors perceive a positive change in the environment. Finally, when considering the extensive margin we again find coefficients that are positive and that tend to be significant, with the significant coefficients ranging between .540 and .750, and implying an increase in FDI flows along the extensive margin of between 71 and 113%. Only a few of the other explanatory variables are found to be significant at any of the margins. The unmatched results at the positive intensive margin are similar to the unmatched results for the full sample. The matched results at the extensive margin bear some similarity to the matched results for the full sample, although the (changes in the) GDP sum and GDP similarity variables are also significant in the former. It appears that (the change in) investments at the positive intensive margin and (the change in) divestments at the negative intensive margin are determined by different variables. This outcome is consistent with the conclusions of Paniagua (2013), who estimates a gravity equation using data on disinvestments from Spain. He also concludes that a BIT deters divestments. 35 The results in Table 3 suggest that the effects of BIT formation on FDI flows occur mainly along the negative intensive and the extensive margins. While this outcome seems reasonable enough, one can object that the implied percentage increases, particularly that for the negative intensive margin seem implausibly large. But whether this is indeed the case depends on the magnitudes of the implied FDI flows. To provide some quantification of these effects, we refer to Figure 1 and note that we have estimates for d, from Table 3, as well as information on the average value of FDI flows for years after the BIT \u00c0 SAFDI\u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de \u00c1 . To estimate the change in FDI flows due to BITs, we require an estimate of what this average value would have been in the absence of the BIT ( \u00c0 SAFDI 0 \u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de \u00c1 ), which we calculate as d SAFDI 0 \u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de \u00bc SAFDI\u00f0BIT\u00bc1\u00de exp d . Given this, the estimated change in average FDI flows due to BIT formation is given by FDI \u00bc SAFDI\u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de \u00c0 d SAFDI 0 \u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de. Adopting this approach, we find that the average increase in FDI for all BITs ranges between $66 and $123 million. The average increase in FDI for the non-BIT country-pairs was around $70 million, meaning that BIT formation more than doubled the increase in FDI that would have been expected if the country-pairs had not formed a BIT. Considering the different margins, the coefficients on the positive intensive margin were found to be negative and occasionally significant, while those on the negative intensive and extensive margins were both positive and significant. In the case of the positive extensive margin, the results suggest a decline in FDI flows of between $222 and $1,011 million. The large estimated coefficients found in the case of the negative intensive margin imply an increase in FDI flows in response to BIT formation ranging between $197 and $199 million, which, while larger than the values of around $66-$123 million found for all new-BIT country-pairs on average, no longer seems particularly extraordinary. 36 The coefficients along the extensive margin suggest a more modest increase in FDI flows ranging between $15 and $26 million on average. While this average effect is relatively small, it does suggest that forming a BIT does allow for positive FDI flows into countries not previously considered viable for FDI flows.",

Figure 3 above raised the possibility that some anticipatory increase in FDI flows might take place in the 2 years preceding a BIT's entry into force. If this is the case, then it could explain our inability to find a significantly positive effect at the positive intensive margin if a significant part of the adjustment had already taken place. It could also mean that some observations which would otherwise be at the negative intensive or the extensive margins are included at the positive intensive margin, again potentially weakening the estimated impact of the BIT. To examine whether this is affecting our results, we repeat our analysis excluding the 2 years prior to BIT formation. In other words, rather than calculating the differenced variables using the 5 years prior to and after our year of interest, we make a comparison of the average value of our variables in the 5 years after our year of interest with averages of our variables in years three to seven prior to our period of interest, thus removing the 2 years in which FDI flows may begin to increase prior to BIT formation. Results are reported in Table 4. The results in Table 4 are quite similar to those reported in Table 2 in that we find a large, positive and significant impact of BIT formation on FDI flows, both in the case of the unmatched and matched samples. The coefficient estimates are not dissimilar to those reported in Table 2 and suggest that BIT formation is associated with an increase in FDI flows of between 91 and 98%. In the case of the positive intensive margin, we find that BITs play no significant role in increasing FDI flows, while we again observe large positive and significant coefficients along the negative intensive margin. Coefficients on the extensive margin also remain positive and significant, with BIT formation implied to increase FDI flows by between 144 and 160%.",

When viewed collectively, we found that BIT formation had a positive and significant impact on FDI flows of somewhere between 50 and 95%. However, this aggregate outcome was shown to mask quite different experiences at the different margins. Where FDI flows were already positive prior to the BIT, we found no significant effect of BIT formation, a result consistent with the view that host institutions were already sufficiently strong so as to render the BIT largely superfluous. Where a BIT was shown to have strong, significant positive effects was where no FDI relationship was present prior to its formation (the extensive margin) or where an existing FDI relationship was disintegrating as evidenced by disinvestment prior to the BIT (the negative intensive margin). These outcomes are consistent with the view that host institutions were viewed as providing insufficient protection to foreign investors in these cases. These results were confirmed by our robustness tests.",

The table reports results based on SAFDI\u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de for all observations, as well as for only those observations for which FDI flows were positive in the period after BIT formation. Note that we use the average value of SAFDI\u00f0BIT \u00bc 1\u00de for all observations also when using coefficients from the matching analysis. Note that for the non-BIT country-pairs (i.e., the control group) the average value of FDI flows in the postperiod (i.e., SAFDI BIT \u00bc 0 \u00f0 \u00de) was $146.28 million ($622.49 million for the non-zero observations in the postperiod). The average value of FDI flows in the initial 5 years (i.e., PAFDI BIT \u00bc 0 \u00f0 \u00de) is $76.55 million ($625.81 million), meaning that the average change between the two periods was $69.73 million ($\u00c03.32 million).",
