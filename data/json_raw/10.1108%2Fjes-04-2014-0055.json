            "text": "It is now generally accepted that well-being and policy are best viewed in many dimensions, and related indices. However, there is an inevitable lack of consensus on which attribute dimensions to include, the relative weights for each, and the substitution between the attributes. In Decancq and Lugo's (2013) paper, a discussion is given of different approaches to determine the relative weights in multidimensional indices of welfare, one of 4 JES 42,1 which is to infer information on weights based on self-reported \"happiness. \" Nardo et al. (2005) proposed a regression of life satisfaction on various variables to derive the relative weights. However, this approach suffers from a number of disadvantages. First, there is over reliance on self-reported indicator of \"happiness.\" Second, it is complex to take into consideration explicit non-linear relationships in regressions. Third, this approach does not handle the substitution relationship among different attributes in a satisfactory manner. In this paper we propose a different strategy. First, we adopt ideal aggregation functions that combine different attributes so as to minimize general entropic divergence between the aggregate's distribution, and the distributions of the constituent attributes. This procedure leaves the parameters of the aggregator function undetermined. But these parameters can be obtained to, again, minimize the entropic divergence between the distribution of the aggregates and the distribution of any desired measure of \"happiness.\" A metric entropy measure is a proper measure of \"distance\" and suitable to compare two or more distributions, with a minimand that identifies weights and other parameters uniquely. This offers an aggregation formula, as in Maasoumi (1986), which is extended in this paper by a numerical optimization routine to identify suitable numerical values for weights and other parameters. These numerically identified well-being measures provide a basis for multidimensional consideration of poverty and inequity.",

We should incorporate more attributes (especially non-tradable ones) to obtain more comprehensive information. However, including more attributes brings in the problem of aggregation, that is how to aggregate different indicators of well-being to represent the welfare level. Maasoumi (1986) proposed a two-step measure of multivariate inequality. In the first step, he used different attributes to construct a welfare aggregate or \"average,\" and in the second step, he calculated the inequality index using each person's welfare evaluation obtained in the first step.

By minimizing the \"divergence measure\" D \u03b2 , we make the welfare vector S \u00bc (S 1 , S 2 , \u2026, S n ) as close to their corresponding multivariate attributes as possible. From Information Theory, the vector S absorbs all the objective information from data, and any deviation from S will cause some distortion. The underlying assumption in this step is that we know the exact weights for different attributes(\u03b1 j 's) and substitution degree between attributes( \u03b2). However, in reality, we do not know. Finding out the parameters is one main issue in this paper, and we will discuss it later. There is also a welfare theoretic basis for this conundrum. Every scalar aggregator endows individual attributes with weights, and levels of substitution, that reflect social valuations. Arrow's impossibility theorems speak to the difficulty of reaching consensus. Generalized entropy measures are equivalent, up to monotonically increasing transformations, very flexible welfare functions. But this merely identifies a family of aggregator functions. The choice of a metric entropy which satisfies the triangularity property of distances resolves some of this indeterminacy, but not all. Here \"calibrating\" toward the distribution of observed \"happiness\" will find parameter values that would be required to \"match\" the underlying attributes and their valuations to the \"happiness\" observation.

The first and second attributes are household per capita income (income for short later)[4] and household per capita net asset (net asset for short later), which represent \"economic\" conditions. For income, it is net income, and we adjust it for provincial CPI and household composition (children count as one half). In Maasoumi and Nickelsburg (1988) and Pasha et al.'s (2005) papers, they both used annual nominal income. And because in CHIPS there is information about assets and debts, we also choose household per capita net asset to capture \"permanent income.\" For urban residents, CHIPS has information about annual personal income, and we calculate household per capita income by taking the average of personal incomes in the same household. For migrants, we calculate household per capita income by dividing the answer to \"total household income from working in cities and family production in 2002\" by the size of household. For rural residents, we use total annual household income divided by family size. For net asset, we first calculate the household net asset by total household financial asset (for rural residents, we also include fixed productive assets) minus total household debt and then divide it by household size. The third attribute is household per capita usable house area (house area for short later) [5], which reflect the housing conditions. In Pasha et al.'s (2005) paper, they used building area. In this paper, we use usable house area for two reasons. First, usable house area reflects better how much space the person can use and live in. Second, most migrants cannot afford buying or renting a whole apartment in cities so they share apartments or rooms with other people. Thus, CHIPS only has data on usable house area for migrants. To calculate household per capita usable house area, we divide the usable house area by family size for urban residents and by the number of family members living together for migrants and rural residents. The fourth attribute is health. It is the answer to body conditions, which contains five categories, \"Worst,\" \"Worse,\" \"Just so-so,\" \"Good,\" and \"Very good,\" and we assign number 1-5 to them, respectively.

Given the data, the choice of parameters determines everyone's welfare and then the distribution, which can be used to conduct some research on inequality or implement some policy analysis. However, there is no wide consensus on how to choose these parameters. In this paper, we will choose the parameters using a method similar to calibration, which can be included in the category \"Hedonic Weights\" in Decancq and Lugo's (2013) paper. Simply speaking, we search the whole parameter space to find the set of parameters making the distance of reported happiness and objective measures of individual welfare smallest. To measure the distance between reported happiness and welfare, we adopt the two methods mentioned in Section 3. Given individuals' attributes and parameters, we can calculate individuals' welfare S i 's, which can be seen as continuous variables across observations. To compare the individuals' welfare with their reported happiness, we transform individuals' welfare into discrete variables. The procedure is as follows: first, we normalize S i into the range [0, 1] by:",

First, it seems the average substitution degrees across different attributes in different groups are relatively similar, and they are different from perfect substitution, which suggests that it may be problematical assuming perfect substitution (as in linear aggregators and regressions). Second, migrants' preference is very similar to urban residents other than for education. Education does not contribute to migrants' utility. A possible explanation is that this phenomenon is related to the Household Registration (Hukou) system in China. There are segregated labor markets in Chinese cities, and migrants are discriminated against for entry in mainly the \"good\" industries, where \"good\" means higher wages combined with higher demand for education and skills (Chen et al., 2009(Chen et al., , 2012Meng and Zhang, 2001). Thus, the contribution of migrants' education to welfare is nearly zero. Third, compared with urban residents and migrants, rural residents put most of their weights on health and less on economic factors (income, net asset, and house area) and education. On the one hand, from happiness literature (Clark et al., 2008;Luttmer, 2005), relative income matters a lot for happiness, which means people would like to compare their income and asset with others. Rural residents are less exposed to external world due to lack of media so they are less likely to compare their income or property with others [11]. Thus, economic factors matter relatively less to their utility. On the other hand, the relatively poor medical conditions and lack of medical security in rural area may be another reason why rural residents care more about health [12].",

We use the obtained parameter sets to calculate inequality in the three groups. In addition, we compare the differences among the three groups and attempt to link them to institutional factors. Main findings in this paper are as follows: first, substitution among attributes matters for multidimensional indices of well-being; second, there are significant group differences in relative weights of attributes in China, which may be related to some social and institutional factors; third, inequality in calculated welfare from metric entropy measure 2 is less than reported happiness inequality. From this study, we learn that we should incorporate substitution among attributes and take into consideration group heterogeneity in multidimensional assessments of well-being and poverty. This would seem to suggest that one size-fits-all policies are not appropriate for China, and perceptions of well-being, objectively and as self-reported, reflect very different concerns, requiring very different approaches. For example, health issues dominate rural perceptions of well-being, whereas education and income are more prominent among other groups. Based on finite and different substitution values, it is safe to assume that different groups place very different monetary values on nonmonetary attributes. This is quite significant for policy analysis going forward.",
