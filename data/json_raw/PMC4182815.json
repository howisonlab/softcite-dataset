            "text": "About 150,000 patients per year suffer moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the USA. All of these are at risk for intracranial hematomas including extra-axial hematomas (both subdural and epidural), as are some of the 1.35 million patients per year who suffer mild traumatic brain injury. Subdural hematomas result from bleeding between the arachnoid mater and dura mater, while epidural hematomas results from bleeding between the dura mater and the skull. Extracranial hematomas are also common in TBI patients, but pose less risk compared to intracranial hematomas. All acute neurologic emergencies require rapid identification of pathophysiologic processes that are amenable to surgical or medical treatment [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. For example, patients with acute intracranial hematomas that are sufficiently large to compromise cerebral blood flow require emergent surgical drainage in order to increase the likelihood of an acceptable neurologic outcome. Evacuation of acute intracranial hematomas within four hours is recommended [3].",

Instead of circulating in blood vessels, blood accumulates in tissues and can induce damage, in particular, damage to brain tissue directly exposed to blood in intracranial hematomas [1][2][3][4]. Before the advent of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), acute intracranial hematomas were diagnosed using physical examination and cerebral angiography. The development of CT and MRI permitted rapid, high-resolution, noninvasive diagnosis, but could not be used until a patient arrived at a major health-care facility.

Although CT and MRI permit hematoma diagnosis, they can be used only at a major health-care facility. This delays hematoma diagnosis and therapy. We proposed to use an optoacoustic technique for rapid, noninvasive diagnosis of hematomas. In this study we developed a near-infrared OPO-based optoacoustic system for hematoma diagnosis and cerebral venous blood oxygenation monitoring in rats. A specially-designed blast device was used to inflict TBI in anesthetized rats. Optoacoustic signals were recorded from the superior sagittal sinus and hematomas that allowed for measurements of their oxygenations. These results indicate that the optoacoustic technique may be used for early diagnosis of hematomas and may provide important information for improving outcomes in patients with TBI. \u00df 2014 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Unlike CT or MRI, heavy shielding and avoidance of magnetic objects is unnecessary. Although diagnosis of delayed intracranial hematomas in hospitalized patients can be definitively accomplished using CT or MRI, more rapid optoacoustic assessment that does not require transport to the radiology department could save time and reduce morbidity in hospitalized patients who suffer sudden neurologic deterioration. Optoacoustic technology that can detect intracranial hematomas can also recognize abnormalities in overall brain perfusion because of associated reductions in oxygen saturation, including that in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) [10][11][12][13][14][15][17][18][19]. The same pre-hospital device can both diagnose intracranial hematomas and document inadequate cerebral perfusion by detecting low SSS hemoglobin saturation.",

Formulating a preliminary diagnosis during pre-hospital transport could provide invaluable information to guide emergency diagnosis and treatment after hospital admission. For instance, if a patient with a deteriorating level of consciousness before hospital admission had an optoacoustic diagnosis of epidural hematoma, surgeons and other hospital personnel could initiate preparations for emergent craniotomy. If that patient were located in a rural area remote from a major medical center, evidence of an intracranial hematoma could prompt transport by helicopter rather than ambulance to speed arrival at a center that could provide emergency neurosurgical treatment."

This spectral range includes the 700-1064 nm spectral range which is best for accurate oxygenation monitoring in deeper blood vessels as shown in our previous studies in large animals (sheep) when we validated our noninvasive method using invasive measurements of the SSS blood oxygenation (blood sampling followed by Co-Oximeter measurements) [11,12,15]. As in the previous works, the ratio of peak-to-peak optoacoustic amplitudes was used for accurate oxygenation measurements. Although direct validation of noninvasive oxygenation measurements in small animal studies is impossible with the invasive measurements due to the size limitations, the high accuracy of SSS blood oxygenation measurements obtained with the system in thicker tissues in our large animal studies justified its application in the rat studies.",

To demonstrate the feasibility of the blast-induced hematoma formation monitoring with this technique, the rat model was best because the blast-induced TBI has been studied in rats by many groups. Blast-induced TBI in large animals is less reproducible and practical and is not well established yet. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the UTMB. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 15, weight = 370-520 g) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in an induction chamber, intubated and mechanically ventilated with a mixture of 70:30 air:oxygen and 1.5-3% isoflurane (2-3% during surgery, 1.5-2% during monitoring). A tail artery was cannulated for continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure via a Biopac MP-100 system (Biopac Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). The instantaneous blood pressure (with a sampling interval of 50 ms) was acquired, displayed and logged by AcqKnowledge 3.9 software running on a Macintosh PC. The current mean arterial pressure (MAP, averaged over the last 30 sec) was periodically calculated and entered in the AcqKnowledge journal. Body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe. The dorsal surface of the head was shaved, and any remaining hair removed with Nair lotion, to minimize the attenuation of the blast wave, the laser pulses, and the acoustic signals during oxygenation monitoring."

The SSS oxygenation (SO 2_SSS ) was measured continuously and in real time for 10 min to provide a baseline. Then the optoacoustic probe was removed and the rat was transferred onto a 5 cm thick foam pad to minimize tertiary blast injuries. Using high-speed video recordings, we had previously confirmed that the force of the blast presses the rat into the foam pad. To block both debris (e.g. unburned powder) and heat from reaching the animal, a 1.5 mm thick silicone rubber pad was placed on the head over a layer of ultrasound gel (which conducted the blast wave). Earplugs were inserted to protect the eardrums. The rat was positioned under the Vandenberg device, with the opening of the barrel 15 mm above the protective pad and directly over the right hemisphere of the brain. A single blast was fired, the rat was returned to its original position, and optoacoustic monitoring was resumed as quickly as practical (typically within 5 min). The OA probe was placed as close as possible to its pre-blast location, while maximizing the SSS signal. MAP monitoring was continued during the blast. Whenever the MAP began to drop rapidly, or if it fell below 60 mmHg, the OA probe was lifted, proper ventilation was verified, and the arterial catheter was flushed with saline. To maintain body temperature in the 37-38 8C range, we placed a warm-water blanket under the rat and a 100 W halogen lamp above it; the lamp was raised or lowered as needed."

            "text": "As the blast-induced swelling progressed, the distance from the skin to the hematoma and SSS peaks increased steadily (Fig. 4). Here we divide the tissue into 3 hypothetical layers, separated by the peaks in the optoacoustic signal. Layer ''scalp'' extends from the skin peak to the extracranial hematoma, layer ''skull''-from extrato intracranial hematoma, and layer ''intracranial''-from intracranial hematoma to SSS. Let d X (t) denote the thickness of layer X, and d total -the total thickness of all layers (the distance from the skin to the SSS). To calculate d X , we multiply the time difference between the optoacoustic peaks by 1.5 mm/ms, the speed of sound in soft tissue. (This will underestimate the skull thickness, but will not affect the % swelling result.) Let t 0 be the time (in minutes) of the start of the monitoring period, and t end -the end of the period. Fig. 4 defines s X (t) (the percent swelling in layer X, relative to initial thickness), Dd X (the absolute change in thickness from start to end of monitoring), and Ds X (total % swelling). The average rate of swelling (in %/min) is given by Ds X /Dt. All results are presented in Table 1. We can see that the rate of swelling before the blast was within measurement error (considering only the total tissue thickness since there were no hematomas yet), but after the blast it was significant. As expected, the skull layer experienced almost no swelling. The intracranial layer did not swell as much as the scalp, probably because it was constrained by the cranium. Fig. 5 shows the blood oxygenation measured in the SSS, intracranial hematoma, and extracranial hematoma of the above mentioned rat. Cerebral blood flow, and hence SSS oxygenation, increases with cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP-ICP), where ICP is intracranial pressure. Before the blast, the ICP was constant but MAP decreased quickly before stabilizing, leading to a gradual decrease in SSS oxygenation. It should be noted that even before the blast MAP was often unstable in the rats due to anesthesia. After the blast, the SSS blood oxygenation gradually decreased from 70% to 60%. While the MAP increased gradually, the ICP increased greatly due to hematoma formation, leading to lower CPP and slowly declining SSS oxygenation. The oxygenation of both hematomas started low and rapidly increased (from 40% to 68% in the intracranial hematoma, and from 40% to 83% in the extracranial hematoma). The decrease of SSS blood oxygenation was due to the blast-induced brain injury resulting in insufficient cerebral blood flow. The higher increase of oxygenation in the extracranial hematoma was due to low oxygen consumption in skin tissue compared to that in brain tissue. In general, skin tissues have higher oxygenation compared to that of other tissues (including brain tissues) because of the lower oxygen consumption. We speculate that the hematoma oxygenation was low (40%) immediately after the blast because: 1) the fresh hematomas consisted primarily of venous blood (70% of cerebral blood is venous) and 2) the blast may result in rapid and transient vasoconstriction within a few minutes after blast. Over time, the pressure gradient between arterial and venous blood resulted in leakage of more highly saturated arterial and capillary blood into the hematoma. The strong correlation between the MAP and the oxygenation of each hematoma supports this hypothesis.",

However, we have already measured SSS oxygenation in adult human volunteers [17] and TBI patients [18] through intact scalp and skull. The penetration depth of our technique in these cases is 2 cm (up to 1 cm scalp and 1 cm skull). In real clinical settings an optoacoustic array may be used to provide real-time, fast data acquisition for hematoma detection.",

            "text": "Our observations have clinical diagnostic significance. Not only will the optoacoustic device detect intracranial hematomas, it also will provide valuable information regarding hemoglobin saturation in the hematoma. Most subdural hematomas result from venous bleeding and would be expected to have relatively low hemoglobin saturation. In contrast, many epidural hematomas result from arterial disruption and would be expected to be associated with hemoglobin saturation similar to arterial saturation. Diagnosis of hematomas with an apparent arterial source could prompt more rapid intervention because arterial bleeding may be more rapidly progressive."

After the blast, new peaks appeared indicating to formation of new areas with blood. The acoustic signal is amplified by a low-noise 40 dB second-stage amplifier and recorded by a high-speed digitizer (NI USB-5132, National Instruments, Austin, TX) at 8 bits resolution and 50 MS/s. The operator interface is a laptop (Dell Precision M4500) running Windows 7 and custom LabVIEW software. The software controls the OPO and analyzes signals in real time to allow for unattended monitoring once the probe is secured."
