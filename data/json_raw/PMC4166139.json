It is reported that mental illness affects up to 50% of older people living in residential aged care, up to 48% in hospital settings and 20% in community dwellings. 2 Furthermore, many individuals above 65 years will experience multiple chronic mental and physical health conditions, making healthcare delivery more complex. 3 4 In Australia 36% of the population aged 65 and above live outside major cities, with reported poorer health outcomes and unmet",

Owing to the complexity of health problems experienced by older people, there is widespread support internationally for the provision of a more integrated approach to care, with a growing evidence base for the effectiveness of this. [11][12][13][14][15] Benefits of a more integrated approach to care include: better outcomes for the client and carer; improved access to and experience of services; and better use of existing resources. 16 Governments and professional groups have prioritised mental health service delivery based in primary care with the need for integration and the provision of the 'right service' at the 'right time', which includes transition between various service sectors. 6 17-20 To address the need for more integrated services through planning, networking and coordination, the Australian Government established a model of regional primary healthcare organisations, called Medicare Locals. i State Governments in Australia have also developed Local Health Networks to manage the delivery of public hospital as well as some out-of-hospital services. Together, Medicare Locals and Local Health Networks, along with a range of general practice, aged care and social care organisations, plan and provide care for older people with mental health problems.",

In part this problem relates to the use of the term 'integration' without specifying its interpretation, which could cover a range of levels from the total integration of organisations or functions under one umbrella through to the formation of loose networks or alliances. 21 In addition, the management of integrated health servicing across numerous organisations requires different management dynamics than for traditional bureaucratic and marketbased forms of healthcare organisation, because organisational independence is retained but cooperation is required. A network approach, whereby a number of independent organisations cooperate to achieve mutual goals has been suggested; but to make change in a network a manager needs to engage in the ongoing negotiation of commitment to the network through facilitating the development of trust and reciprocity between partners. 22 A recent review examining the effectiveness of links in primary mental healthcare identified a paucity of real world testing of practical management models of integrated health servicing. 23 This means that there are not clear and well-understood processes through which a network of organisations can work together to meet the mental healthcare needs of older people.",

From this starting point of reflective practice we drew from a previous narrative review of the first author on the linkage strategies and enablers in primary mental healthcare. Ten linkage strategies were identified 11 as well as the factors that enable the development of these strategies. 23  Table 1 describes the linkage strategies and figure 1 shows the enablers. The process that brings the enablers together is evaluation feedback (reflective practice), which in this proposed study will occur through facilitated reflection.

This region has a growing older population with a 52% increase in those aged 65 years and above from 2001 to 2011. 32 The region is typical of many Australian rural locations that are within 100 km of metropolitan centres, but which still face difficulties in service access, coordination and follow-up because of differences in funding criteria and boundaries between services. While there is no purposive or managed network of services related to older people's mental health in the region, there are a number of regular interagency meetings and there is a 'Positive Ageing Taskforce' involving a range of service providers that is managed by the local government and funded by the national government. There is no binding commitment made by local services to the Taskforce and it has no formal decision-making function or specific resources. Hence, the network of services is best described as loose, informal and not explicitly defined. Specialist mental health services are delivered to older people living in the region by the local communitybased mental health team with a consultation liaison service available at the large mental health hospital some 80 kms away in the capital city. Acute inpatient units providing psychiatric inpatient treatment for persons 65 years and above are also located in the capital city, but these are run by metropolitan networks of the South Australian Government health system. At the request of the Positive Ageing Taskforce we recently undertook a study in this region exploring the views of health and social care providers about the barriers to mental healthcare for older people. 33 We found a wide range of organisations provide care to older people and that while collaborative arrangements tended to be informal, these arrangements were well regarded. Barriers to more integrated services related to the difficulty in getting all relevant agencies to become involved in these collaborative arrangements, insufficient knowledge about available services, inadequate referral processes, competition for funding and also gatekeeping that restricts which clients a service will accept. The lack of attention to the client's physical and mental health issues by services was thought to be a problem.",
