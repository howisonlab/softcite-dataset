            "text": "Human age-related diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), have long been associated to mitochondrial dysfunction; however, the role for adipose tissue mitochondria in these conditions remains unknown. We have tackled the impact of aging and T2DM on adipocyte mitochondria from obese patients by quantitating not only the corresponding abundance changes of proteins, but also the redox alterations undergone by Cys residues thereof. For that, we have resorted to a high-throughput proteomic approach based on isobaric labeling, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The alterations undergone by the mitochondrial proteome revealed aging-and T2DM-specific hallmarks. Thus, while a global decrease of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits was found in aging, the diabetic patients exhibited a reduction of specific OXPHOS complexes as well as an up-regulation of the anti-oxidant response. Under both conditions, evidence is shown for the first time of a link between increased thiol protein oxidation and decreased protein abundance in adipose tissue mitochondria. This association was stronger in T2DM, where OXPHOS mitochondrial-vs. nuclear-encoded protein modules were found altered, suggesting impaired mitochondrial protein translocation and complex assembly. The marked down-regulation of OXPHOS oxidized proteins and the alteration of oxidized Cys residues related to protein import through the redox-active MIA (Mitochondrial Intermembrane space Assembly) pathway support that defects in protein translocation to the mitochondria may be an important underlying mechanism for mitochondrial dysfunction in T2DM and physiological aging. The present draft of redox targets together with the quantification of protein and oxidative changes may help to better understand the role of oxidative stress in both a physiological process like aging and a pathological condition like T2DM.",

White adipose tissue, the main adiposity regulator, is not merely a fat reservoir, but also a complex, essential endocrine organ [6]. Detrimental accumulation of the major intra-abdominal fat depot, the visceral adipose tissue (VAT), significantly increases the risk for metabolic comorbidities, like insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [7].",

Some of the key factors contributing to IR are: i) excessive nutrient supply to adipocytes, which leads to ROS production; ii) pro-inflammatory processes; iii) endoplasmic reticulum stress; iv) cell aging; and v) altered mitochondrial dynamics (such as fusion and fission events) [9][10][11]. Thus, mitochondrion is both the origin and target of multiple metabolic signals whose integration maintains insulin sensitivity. Importantly, it has been suggested that mitochondrial redox signaling has a key role in white adipose tissue, regulating different processes such as adipocyte differentiation or adiponectin secretion through the modulation of redoxsensitive transcriptional factors [12,13]. Not surprisingly, given that white adipose tissue is the greatest endocrine organ in the human body any alteration in adipocyte mitochondria could result in significant homeostatic disturbances.",

Cys is considered the most important redox-responsive amino acid due to its chemical properties and the range of its different oxidation states, together with its involvement in highly conserved functional positions in proteins. Additionally, due to their relevance and specificity, reversible Cys modifications have been suggested to play a main role in the regulation of protein activity and signal transduction [25,26]. In spite of their enormous potential, the function of oxidative modifications under physiological and pathophysiological conditions remains largely unknown. For these reasons, in this work we have further coupled our proteomic analysis with the study of dynamic alterations of oxidized Cys residues (oxCys) using a GELSILOX-based method [27].",

None of the non-diabetic patients suffered T2DM or other obesity-associated comorbidity (hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome or cardiovascular disease). Inclusion criterion for the diabetic group was suffering T2DM for at least two years. T2DM was defined by fasting plasma glucose > 7 mmol/L and HbA1c > 6.5%. All T2DM subjects were being treated with oral anti-diabetic drugs and in one case with insulin in order to control the comorbidities. Exclusion criteria encompassed: i) clinically significant hepatic, neurological, or other major systemic disease, including malignancy; ii) history of drug or alcohol abuse, defined as > 80 g/day, or serum transaminase activity more than twice the upper normal range limit; iii) elevated serum creatinine concentrations; iv) acute illnesses and current evidence of chronic inflammatory or infectious diseases; and v) mental illness rendering the subjects unable to understand the scope of the analysis.",

Peptide and protein abundance changes were assessed using the iTRAQ reporter ion intensities retrieved from MS/MS scans by QuiXoT software [30,31] as inputs to the WSPP model [32]. This model circumvents the statistical issues reported for protein quantitation from iTRAQlabeled peptides [33] and, by decomposing the different variance components, takes into account variance non-homogeneity and the highly unbalanced structure of this kind of data [32]. The model also provides a robust framework for the full integration of quantitative and error information from a given level to a superior level (e.g. peptide to protein); thus, the standardized variable, Zq, is defined as the meancorrected log 2 ratio expressed in units of standard deviation at the protein level. For the quantitation of Cys oxidation, oxCys peptide abundance was evaluated by the corresponding standardized log 2 ratio, Zp, therefore avoiding biased calculations due to changes in the abundance of the proteins from which these peptides originated [27]. The threshold for differential protein and peptide abundance was set at |Zq|\u22652 and |Zp|\u22652, respectively. For the analysis of coordinated protein responses [34] a standardized log 2 ratio, Zc, was calculated for each functional protein category.

To further define the hallmarks of aging and T2DM in obese adipocyte mitochondria, we have resorted to a high-throughput proteomic procedure based on peptide iTRAQ labeling and LC-MS analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 2). Mitochondrial samples were obtained from adipocytes previously isolated from VAT biopsies from 32 obese subjects ( Fig. 1A). For proteome profiling, a subgroup of 12 obese women was selected according to the most homogeneous clinical features, and split in three different groups: diabetic over 45 years (n=4); non-diabetic over 45 years (n=4) and non-diabetic under 35 years (n=4) (Fig. 1B, Table 1). This facilitated two differential proteomic studies in a single experiment: diabetic vs. non-diabetic women over 45 years (T2DM differences), and older (mean age 50 years) vs. younger (mean age 32 years) non-diabetic women (age differences). For orthogonal validation analyses, a second cohort of patients (n=20) was independently considered.",

Co-isolated non-mitochondrial proteins were excluded from statistical analysis based on GO mitochondrion annotation (GO:0005739) and the Human MitoCarta database. Furthermore, since protein functional categories often result from non-experimental annotations [40], several additional proteins were filtered out based on their canonical functions and other sources of evidence such as The Human Protein Atlas [41]. Thus, 706 bona fide mitochondrial proteins were finally subjected to quantitative statistical analysis. The distribution of protein content across the main organelle compartments revealed a consistent and reliable mitochondrial proteome, as expected Table 1 Clinical characteristics of obese patients considered for mitochondrial proteome profiling.

These analyses revealed that global OXPHOS down-regulation is a key hallmark of age progression in adipocyte mitochondria (Fig. 2 A, Supplementary Table 3). These results were confirmed by Western Blot (WB) in an independent set of mitochondria samples using selected OXPHOS markers ( Supplementary Fig. 3A). Additionally, the up-regulation of Vitamin D metabolism was also found associated with aging. In the T2DM comparison, protein-coordination analyses highlighted an up-regulation of Response to oxygen levels process, among other protein functional categories (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Table 3). The Response to oxygen levels is illustrated by a significant increase of relevant components of the cellular antioxidant machinery like mitochondrial thioredoxin (TXN2) or mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2), which were found up-regulated in the T2DM assessment (Zq=4.02 and Zq=4.45, respectively). SOD2 is a key scavenging enzyme that converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen in the mitochondrial matrix. SOD2 levels were also found increased in diabetic compared to non-diabetic patients by WB, using a second cohort of patients ( Supplementary Fig. 3B), in agreement with earlier studies [47,48]. To further illustrate the above-described degree of coordinated behavior in aging and T2DM comparisons, the cumulative frequency distribution of protein changes (Zq) was plotted for the least redundant categories within the aging and T2DM clusters (Fig. 2C, D). Altogether, the coordinated responses highlight that the proteome alterations follow well-differentiated patterns of adipocyte mitochondrial dysfunction in both conditions, supporting our previous studies based on whole VAT [38].",

Protein changes in two of the most wellknown ETC complexes, I and IV, were studied in detail (Fig. 3B, C). Complex I is the largest enzyme complex of the respiratory chain encompassing 45 different subunits and requiring at least 13 specific assembly factors, and its activity facilitates the main entry of reducing power (through NADH) into the oxidative machinery [49,50]. Its Lshaped structure is made up of a peripheral arm containing two functional blocks, the N (NADH binding) and the Q (ubiquinone binding) modules, and a membrane arm consisting of the P (proton pumping) element [51]. Complex IV is the terminal oxidase set of ETC enzymes, where the electrons are transported by four redox-active centers to molecular oxygen [52]. Complex IV relies on a dimeric structure where the three core components (MT-CO1, MT-CO2 and MT-CO3), translated within the organelle, must be assembled with the rest of nuclear-encoded components to reach an active form [53]. The schematic representation of protein abundance along complex I and IV structures, according to up-to-date information [49,50,53,54], clearly evidenced the down-regulation of most of the protein components of these complexes as obese patients age (Fig. 3B, C). Interestingly, this effect is more pronounced in the N module of complex I, involved in NADH binding (Fig. 3B), as well as in the two core proteins (MT-CO1 and MT-CO2) and two peripherally localized subunits (COX6B1 and COX6C) of complex IV (Fig. 3C). Since the decreased level of these proteins could contribute not only to the instability of both complex structures but also to their activity decline, our data could suggest an impairment of the electron flux within the mitochondrial ETC in the adipocytes from older compared to younger obese subjects.",

Notably, the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), the main player in the regulation of mtDNA copy number [55], and involved in mtDNA stability, replication and transcription [56], was also found significantly diminished in older compared to younger obese patients (Zq=\u22123.05). These results were confirmed by WB analyses ( Supplementary Fig. 3A). The involvement of TFAM in aging is tissue-specific [57] and has been mainly investigated in several rodent tissues. Remarkably, an aged-related decrease in TFAM amount in muscle and liver tissues of rats has been reported [57,58], further validating our results. Noteworthy, we previously described nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein reduction in whole VAT biopsies with aging [38]. Altogether, our data support the decrease of ETC complexes with aging progression in adipocyte mitochondria.",

Earlier studies in subcutaneous adipose tissue also reported the down-regulation of mitochondrial complex III, IV and V in obesityassociated IR [59], in agreement with our results. Protein changes in the different complex I modules are illustrated in the schematic representation shown in Fig. 4B. Results highlighted a distinctive protein expression pattern depending on the complex modules. Thus, the P module was found up-regulated while the Q and N modules were mostly down-regulated. Moreover, a pronounced increase of succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b560 protein (SDHC) was uncovered. SDHC is the membrane-anchoring subunit C of complex II in charge of transferring electrons from succinate to ubiquinone, and also participates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). On the other hand, complex II is the minor site of entry of reducing equivalents into the ETC (from FADH 2 ). Our data suggest that complex II increase could be a compensatory response for the reduction of the oxidative capacity in diabetic compared to non-diabetic patients, due to the down-regulation of complex III, IV and V. In consonance with our results, complex II increased activity together with complex I, III and IV deficiencies, have been reported in the adipose tissue from a mouse model [60]. These authors also reported an enhancement of citrate synthase (CS) activity. Similarly, our results revealed that CS, a key enzyme of TCA, was upregulated in the T2DM comparison (Zq=3.28; Supplementary Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table 2), suggesting a metabolic shift favoring succinate (complex II)-driven respiration in the adipose tissue of our diabetic patients.",

            "text": "Noteworthy, and in contrast with the results found in the age comparison, the mtDNA-encoded proteins were mostly found upregulated in T2DM ( Supplementary Fig. 5B). This may be accounted for by the alteration of mtDNA-encoded protein translation [61] and/ or underline the impairment of complex assembly owing to abnormal accumulation of specific modules. Our hypothesis about defective complex assembly is in agreement with the protein changes observed for complex I and IV structures, where clear differences between modules are observed in the relative abundance of nuclear vs. mtDNA-encoded proteins (Fig. 4B, C). Thus, the P module from complex I, which contains the highest number of mtDNA-encoded proteins, is up-regulated while the N module, which is exclusively made up of nuclear-encoded subunits, was found down-regulated (Fig. 4B). Likewise, in complex IV data revealed differences in the relative abundance between mtDNA (core module) and nuclear-encoded proteins (Fig. 4C). Of note, both the P module in complex I and the core module in complex IV are gathered in the first steps of the complex assembly process [49,53], strengthening our premise about defects in the accumulation of specific modules during complex assembly. This defective accumulation of mtDNA-encoded protein modules may be due, in part, to an impaired translocation of nuclear-encoded subunits to the mitochondrion in diabetic compared to non-diabetic subjects that would consequently lead to deficient complex assembly. Nuclear-encoded proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and transported to the mitochondrion mainly via chaperones like heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and into the mitochondrion via mitochondrial membrane transporters (mostly TOM and TIM complexes) [62,63]. Interestingly, we have previously reported significantly lower levels of HSP70 in diabetic compared to non-diabetic patients [17], and in the present study we have found a down-regulation of several TOMM proteins, like TOMM70A (Zq=\u22123.31) and TOMM20 (Zq=\u22122.07) ( Supplementary Table 2), further supporting our hypothesis.",

The oxCys proteins were mainly oxidoreductases involved in Antioxidant activity or Nucleotide binding functions representing key mitochondrial processes such as Oxidative phosphorylation, Tricarboxylic acid cycle or \u03b2-oxidation among others (Supplementary Table 5). Of note, 44 of the oxCys peptides identified (about 20%) pertained to OXPHOS subunits. Some of these oxCyscontaining proteins belonged to complex I and IV, as shown in red color in Figs. 3B-C and 4B-C. It is noteworthy that no oxCys sites were identified in mtDNA-encoded proteins (intra-membrane subunits); only proteins located in the inter-membrane or the matrix spaces exhibited these modifications (Figs. 3B-C, 4B-C). The WSPP statistical model revealed 21 and 30 oxCys peptides differentially abundant in the aging and the T2DM comparisons, respectively ( Table 2, Supplementary Table 4). Remarkably, a considerable number of the altered oxCys sites corresponded to known disulfide bonds or to C-X 9 -C type motifs (e.g. Cys 30 and Cys 65 of COX6B1 and Cys 36 of NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 8, NDUFA8) ( Table 2). These C-X 9 -C domains are localized in nuclear-encoded proteins that are imported into the mitochondrion through the evolutionary conserved redox-active MIA (Mitochondrial Intermembrane space Assembly) pathway [67]. This minor pathway depends on redoxregulated folding events that stabilize, trap and finally import into the mitochondrion the C-X 9 -C domain-carrying proteins like NDUFA8, NDUFS5 and COX6B1. NDUFA8, NDUFS5 are important accessory molecules that take part in the last stages of complex I assembly [68], whereas COX6B1 is a key protein involved in the biogenesis [69] and the stabilization of complex IV subunits [43]. Noteworthy, our redox proteomics data revealed that in T2DM comparison Cys-peptides from the aforementioned C-X 9 -C domain-carrying proteins were significantly oxidized; likewise, in the aging comparison several oxCyscontaining peptides from COX6B1 were significantly increased (Table 2). Altogether, these data suggest an inadequate import of nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitochondria through the MIA pathway, with consequent compromised complex assembly. Since aging has long been associated to IR progression [70,71], the alteration of MIA pathway emerges as a connecting link between the pathology (i.e. IR) and the physiological aging. To our knowledge, this is the first time that defective protein transport alongside the organelle is pointed out as a hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and T2DM.",

Our data have revealed that oxCys abundance follows distinctive patterns concerning OXPHOS complexes in the two comparisons. In aging, the oxidation was mainly localized in complex III and IV, which also comprised the most downregulated proteins (Fig. 6A). In T2DM, however, the oxidation was restricted to complex I and IV (Fig. 6B), where most oxidized proteins showed down-regulated and oxCys peptides were significantly more abundant. This outcome is particularly pronounced in COX6B1, where oxidative changes in the C-X 9 -C domains could lead to its defective import into the mitochondrion through the MIA pathway, as earlier pointed out. Accordingly, our data suggest that COX6B1 oxidation could contribute to complex IV dysfunction. To further investigate this issue, we examined complex IV activity in a different set of mitochondrial samples. Interestingly, our data showed a significant decrease of complex IV activity in diabetic compared to non-diabetic patients (Fig. 7A). Remarkably, previous studies had evidenced that resveratrol, an anti-oxidant metabolite, improves complex IV activity [43], thus strengthening our results. In addition, Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analyses of digitonin-solubilized adipocyte mitochondria revealed that complex IV was found significantly decreased in diabetic compared to non-diabetic patients (Fig. 7B), potentially accounting for the reduction of complex IV activity in T2DM. Consequently this alteration may support the respiratory dysfunction postulated for T2DM, since complex IV is associated to complex I and III in the different supercomplexes (SCs) [73]. Thus, 2D BN-PAGE assays revealed a trend toward the down-regulation of these SCs in diabetic patients (Fig. 7C). In agreement with these observations, impaired SCs assembly has been reported in muscle mitochondria from diabetic subjects [74].",

            "text": "In the current work we have used adipose tissue from obese patients to address two different events previously related to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction: aging, a physiological situation, and T2DM, a severe obesity-associated disorder. In these two comparisons Cys oxidation levels correlated negatively with protein abundance, notably in T2DM, where a greater number of these proteins were OXPHOS subunits. In diabetic patients the proteomic signature of mitochondrial dysfunction comprises: i) a decrease of specific OXPHOS subunits together with reduced complexes and SCs; ii) an increase of the antioxidant response; iii) adjustment of mitochondrial-vs. nuclearencoded protein modules suggesting a dysfunctional protein translocation into the mitochondria; and iv) oxidative Cys modifications related to defects in protein import through the MIA pathway. We have demonstrated an impaired activity of complex IV, which brings together the most down-regulated and, at the same time, the most oxidized OXPHOS protein components. Oxidative damage and protein changes undergone by the OXPHOS system may compromise the metabolic status of the adipocyte due to an imbalance of NADH/ NAD + and/or ATP/ADP levels. In addition, the modifications of proteins related to mitochondrial transport could also impact intraand inter-organelle crosstalk, severely disrupting adipocyte homeostasis and therefore leading to aberrant insulin sensitivity. The hallmark of age progression on mitochondrial remodeling also includes down-regulation of OXPHOS components together with increased Cys oxidation levels, albeit to a lesser extent as compared with the T2DM condition. It is not surprising that ROS and oxidative modifications play a more relevant role in a pathological condition like T2DM as compared to a physiological event like aging. In this sense, Complex IV emerges as a common target connecting the oxidative hallmarks of T2DM and aging progression, potentially accounting for the progression of insulin resistance over time in obese individuals.",

The unprecedented capacity of this methodology has generated a vast amount of biologically relevant information, producing a molecular picture of the complex interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and aging, obesity and T2DM. Furthering our knowledge about reversible oxidative modifications and their implications would help to develop advanced integrative models of proteome regulation and redox signaling pathways, providing a basis for improved redox-based therapeutics in obese patients.
