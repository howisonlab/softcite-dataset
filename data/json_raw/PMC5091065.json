Twelve individuals (6 men and 6 women) were submitted to a maximal incremental test (to determine maximal aerobic power [MAP] and V. O2peak [peak oxygen uptake]), high-intensity intermittent all-out exercise (60\u00d7 8-sec bouts interspersed by 12-sec passive recovery) and fixed high-intensity intermittent exercise (100% maximal aerobic speed, consisted of 1-min repetitions at MAP [70 rpm] separated by 1-min of passive recovery). Blood samples were collected pre, immediately, 45 and 90-min postexercise. Serum was analyzed for total cholesterol and its ratio, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and triacylglycerol (TAG). For TAG there was a main effect of moment with higher values immediately postexercise compared to 45-min postexercise. For VLDL there was a main effect to moment with higher values immediately post exercise than pre and 45-min postexercise; higher values 90-min postexercise than 45-min postexercise. There was no effect for HDL-c, LDL-c, and cholesterol. For area under the curve there was no difference for any variable. Our results indicated that both kinds of acute exercise session lead to no improvement in the acute response of serum lipid profile of healthy young.",

However, an alternative protocol, 1-min cycling efforts interspersed with 1 min of recovery, has showed positive results by fixed exercise intensity based in maximum indexes (i.e.,. maximum oxygen uptake or maximum load attained in incremental test) (Helgerud et al., 2007;Little et al., 2010), and also is feasible for healthy, overweight/obese and individuals with higher risk for cardiometabolic disorders (Gillen et al., 2013;Hood et al., 2011).",

Cadence was set at 70 rpm, and subjects were instructed to perform the test until they could no longer continue. The test was finished when subjects could not maintain the load for 5 sec in the fixed cadence. Strong verbal encouragement was given during the test. The oxygen uptake was measured (MetaMax 3B, Cortex, Leipzig, Germany) throughout the test and the average of the last 30 sec was defined as V . O2peak. The maximal load reached in the test was defined as the maximal intensity attained (MAP). When the subject was not able to finish the 1-min stage, the power was expressed according to the permanence time in the last stage, determined as the following: MAP=power of last stage completed + [(time, in seconds, remaining in the last stage multiplied by 25 W or 15 W)/60 sec].",

As previously discussed the energy expenditure in two HIIE protocols was not able to induces changes in HDL concentrations. However, it should be emphasized that the HDL concentration is a measurement of the total cholesterol content alone, carried in plasma HDL. Moreover, there is a heterogeneity in the HDL composition (Fruchart et al., 1993), as well as, there are HDL subfractions that are more likely to suffer the effects of acute exercise (Campbell et al., 2011;Frey et al., 1993;Park and Ransone, 2003).

Freese et al. (2015) showed that four all-out bouts (Wingate test), performed acutely prior and after 6-week training, resulted in no changes in fasting triacylglycerol in middle-aged women with metabolic syndrome. However, when postprandial lipemia was analyzed all-out bouts resulted in 13.1% decrease in this group. Such outcome probably occurred because women with metabolic syndrome present higher postprandial lipemia than their healthy peer (Kolovou et al., 2006), and thus, be more likely to show changes.",

Furthermore, there are sustainable evidences showing that aerobic exercise is one of the most effective in improving lipoprotein profile regarding the population (Tambalis et al., 2009). However, since obesity rates remain increasing in several countries and the free-living time for exercise practice is diminishing, the HIIE protocols emerge as a low financial cost and time-efficient exercise and way to help in the prevention and probably treatment for many chronic diseases, especially by its ability to improve physical fitness and body composition. However, the most efficient HIIE protocol to improve lipid profile remains yet not established.",
