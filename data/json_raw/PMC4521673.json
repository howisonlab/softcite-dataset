            "text": "Poor adherence to cardioprotective medications after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) hospitalization is associated with increased risk of rehospitalization and mortality. Clinical trials of multifaceted interventions have improved medication adherence with varying results. Patients' perspectives on interventions could help researchers interpret inconsistent outcomes. Identifying factors that patients believe would improve adherence might inform the design of future interventions and make them more parsimonious and sustainable. The objective of this study was to obtain patients' perspectives on adherence to medical regimens after experiencing an ACS event and their participation in a medication adherence randomized control trial following their hospitalization. Patients and methods: Sixty-four in-depth interviews were conducted with ACS patients who participated in an efficacious, multifaceted, medication adherence randomized control trial. Interview transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative approach. Results: Participants described their post-ACS event experiences and how they affected their adherence behaviors. Patients reported that adherence decisions were facilitated by mutually respectful and collaborative provider-patient treatment planning. Frequent interactions with providers and medication refill reminder calls supported improved adherence. Additional facilitators included having social support, adherence routines, and positive attitudes toward an ACS event. The majority of patients expressed that being active participants in health care decision-making contributed to their health. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that respectful collaborative communication can contribute to medication adherence after ACS hospitalization. These results suggest a potential role for training health-care providers, including pharmacists, social workers, registered nurses, etc, to elicit and acknowledge the patients' views regarding medication treatment in order to improve adherence. Future research is needed with providers to understand how they elicit and acknowledge patients' views, particularly in the face of nonadherence, and with patients to understand how to empower them to share their opinions with their providers.",

[2][3][4][5][6] Multifaceted interventions targeting medication adherence and health behaviors have demonstrated varying results. 7,8 Understanding patients' perspectives on their experiences following an ACS event and their opinions of the effectiveness of such interventions may support adherence behaviors. 9 correspondence: Anne lambert-Kerzner Veterans health Administration (VA) eastern colorado health care system, 1055 clermont st, Denver, cO 80220, UsA Tel +1 720 857 5129 email anne.lambert-kerzner@va.gov The high prevalence of medication nonadherence following an ACS event is not surprising considering that evidence-based treatment plans are often complex and lifelong. [2][3][4][5][6] Adherence declines over time following hospital discharge, with one-third of patients stopping at least one medication within 1 month [3][4][5][6] and 40% of patients discontinuing statins within 1 year. 2,3,10 Mitigating the consequences of poor adherence to cardiac medications remains a major public health challenge. 11 Therefore, understanding and identifying factors that support positive adherence behavior in a predominately older male population, who are at a higher risk for an ACS event, 1 is needed to shed light on this pervasive issue. While the literature identifies barriers to adherence, including health systems, condition, patient, therapy, and socioeconomicrelated factors, 11 no prior studies have identified patients' perspectives on supportive adherence factors after an ACS event and their participation in a medication adherence randomized control trial (RCT). Recommendations of the International Expert Forum on Patient Adherence 9,12 support exploring patients' beliefs about adherence. Moreover, intervention experts such as the Medical Research Council [13][14][15] support exploring participants' perspectives on the effectiveness of the interventions.",

All those approached agreed to participate in the interviews. Then to assess new or different data from the other three sites, the project managers at their respective sites randomly chose participants and asked if they would participate in the interviews. In Seattle, seven patients were approached and all of them agreed; in Little Rock, five were approached and three of them agreed; and in Durham, three of them were approached and all of them agreed. This sample was interviewed in person or through telephone by a member of the trained qualitative team (ALK, MSM, KMF, and MK). Qualitative interview data were collected from August 2011 to May 2013. The purpose of the interview was to gather 1) in-depth understanding about the experience after an ACS event; 2) the effect of relationships with providers on their adherence behaviors; and 3) opinions about the RCT study. The 45-60-minute interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Baseline demographics, including age, sex, race, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, were obtained to characterize the study population. This qualitative study was approved as part of the RCT by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board. 2,3 ",

Emergent codes were added throughout the analysis. The remaining interviews were divided among the team and coded using ATLAS.ti (ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH). The consistency of coding/interpretation was checked at biweekly meetings where discrepancies were addressed through consensus. Triangulation of the qualitative findings, observations, and the RCT quantitative findings were integrated and documented with an audit trail.

[20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] Mulder et al 28 and Apollo et al 29 highlight that HIV patients desire to go beyond just sharing in the decisionmaking process. They want to be collaborative in the process of medication decision-making. Our study contributes to the literature by identifying similar findings within patients with cardiovascular disease, specifically ACS. In fact, adherence experts have emphasized that understanding adherence behaviors in relation to each disease condition was an important aspect of adherence to the prescribed medications. [22][23][24][25] In contrast to prior studies that have focused on nonadherence behaviors, our unique study focuses on facilitators of adherence. Understanding this unique population of predominately older males, who remain at higher risk for an ACS event, 1 provides a contemporary perspective into adherence behaviors. The distinctiveness of the male adherence behavior indicates that worse health outcomes are due in part to men's health-related beliefs and behaviors, which include denial of weakness or vulnerability, control, and the appearance of being strong with the dismissal of need for help. 30,31 Men may believe it is unacceptable to express emotional or physical pain with other men. 30 These male-specific factors may explain the post-ACS reactions of participants that resulted in their inability to adhere to prescribed medications, activities, and/or stopping previous exercise routines and discomfort sharing their feelings with their providers.",

ACS events can evoke complex psychological reactions, as described by the veterans. Patients vary in their capacity to use this information about their health productively to develop and maintain new health behaviors. When patients struggle to adhere to medications, they may have difficulty communicating this information to their physician. [32][33][34][35] Therefore, the importance of patients' and physicians' shared sense of purpose and effort around treatment goals is paramount to the quality of the patients' outcomes. Our findings demonstrated that when patients were more engaged and participated in the development of the treatment plan, they were more likely to implement the treatment plan. Consequently, patients were empowered, gaining greater control over decisions and actions that affected their health. 36 Yet, despite the importance of increased patient involvement and empowerment around health-care decisions, such as in Patient-Centered Care and Shared Decision Making 37,38 paradigms, not all practitioners are successful implementing these shared and collaborative decision-making concepts. 39,40 Mulder et al found that when patients failed to adhere, providers reverted to a more paternalistic approach, using risk communication about consequences of nonadherence. 28 Moreover, when providers fail to utilize a collaborative process with patients, they are unaware of the actual adherence behavior of the patient. When the provider is aware the patient will not follow through with the prescribed treatment plan, the collaborative process allows the provider the opportunity to offer alternative options, which may not be optimal but ultimately may be better than no care.",
