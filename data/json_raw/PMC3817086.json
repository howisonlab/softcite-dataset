In this study, we characterized the expression of MLKL in ovarian carcinomas and evaluated the prognostic value of MLKL in patients with ovarian cancer. Materials and methods: The ovarian cancer tissue specimens were collected from 153 patients diagnosed as primary ovarian cancer after operation at The Second Xiangya Hospital from January 2005 to December 2008. Immunohistochemistry was performed for MLKL and the protein expression score was quantified using an established scoring system. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for all patients. MLKL expression levels were correlated with DFS and OS using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results: Seventy-five patients (49%) were defined as having high MLKL expression and 67 patients (43.7%) had .80% of cells staining for MLKL. Remarkably, low MLKL expression was significantly associated with decreased DFS (median 40 months versus 25 months, P=0.0282) and OS (median 43 months versus 28 months, P=0.0032). In multivariate analysis, retained significance was also observed. Conclusion: Low MLKL expression was significantly associated with both decreased DFS and OS in patients with primary ovarian cancer. MLKL expression may serve as a potential prognostic marker in patients with ovarian cancer.",

            "text": "Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in women, and it is the third most common gynecological cancer. 1 In the People's Republic of China, the age-standardized incidence and mortality rates of ovarian cancer are 3.4 and 1.6 per 100,000, respectively. 2 Despite advances in surgical resections and systemic chemotherapies, the prognosis of ovarian cancer remains poor and the 5-year survival rate is only approximately 30% after the initial diagnosis. 3 The main reason for the poor rate of survival is that early symptoms of malignant ovarian tumors are silent and most of the patients have an advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis. In addition, primary or secondary multidrug resistances also account for failure in treatment of ovarian cancer. 4 Thus, identifying novel molecular markers with prognostic value is important for improving therapeutic methods and extending survival of ovarian cancer patients.",

            "text": "Necrosis is a type of cell death and is morphologically characterized by a gain in cell volume, swelling of organelles, plasma membrane rupture, and subsequent loss of intracellular contents. 5 Necrosis is often observed in solid tumors with overgrowth and many cancer treatments can induce necrotic cell death. 6,7 Necrosis can occur in a controlled and regulated manner, which is called necroptosis. 8 The initiation of necroptosis can be induced through death receptors including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1, TNF receptor 2, and cluster of differentiation 95 (FasR). The serine/threonine kinases, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), and receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) are key regulators of necrotic signaling. 8 The mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) has been recently identified as a key RIP3 downstream component of TNF-induced necrosis. 9,10 MLKL is phosphorylated by RIP3 and is recruited to the necrosome through its interaction with RIP3. In addition, it has been shown that prolonged c-Jun N terminal kinase activation contributes to TNF-induced necrosis. 11 Several studies demonstrated that the activation of c-Jun N terminal kinase is associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. 12,13 However, the prognostic values of RIP1 and RIP3, the key components of the necroptosis pathway, have not been evaluated in cancer patients. Interestingly, a recent study suggested that MLKL expression can serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for patients with early-stage resected pancreatic cancer. 14 However, the prognostic value of MLKL in other types of cancers and the role of MLKL in cancer necroptosis is unknown. In this study, we investigate the expression and prognostic value of MLKL in patients with ovarian cancer.  (Table 1). Disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated from the date of the first cycle of first-line chemotherapy to the first radiological evidence of recurrence. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of histological diagnosis to the date of cancer-caused death or to the date of the last follow-up examination.",

After washing three times with PBS, the slides were stained with the ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories Inc). Finally, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared, and then mounted with Permount mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Histological images were captured from the microscope (Carl Zeiss AX10; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) with an objective magnification of X40, and high-resolution digital images were acquired and processed with Axionvision software (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). MLKL staining was scored independently by two pathologists and was calculated using a previously defined scoring system. 15,16 Briefly, the proportion of positive tumor cells was scored as: 0= less than 5%; 1+=5%-20%; 2+=21%-50%; and 3+.50%. The intensity was arbitrarily scored as 0= weak (no color or light blue), 1= moderate (light yellow), 2= strong (yellow brown), and 3= very strong (brown). The overall score was calculated by multiplying the two scores obtained from each sample. A score of $4 was defined as high MLKL expression and a score of ,4 was defined low MLKL expression.",

            "text": "As all of the patients in our study received cisplatin-based chemotherapy, our study provides a potential biomarker for clinicians to better select chemotherapies based on MLKL expression. Patients with low MLKL expression in tumor tissues may be less likely to benefit from the regular cisplatin-based chemotherapy. However, these patients may benefit from combination chemotherapy or participation in clinical trials. Thus, future studies should examine the role of MLKL in predicting response to different therapies for better treatment selection. Recently, there have been reports of several other proteins that may serve as a prognosis biomarker for ovarian cancer patients such as steroid receptor coactivator-3, high-mobility group AT-hook 2, c-Abl, and centromere protein A. 16,[19][20][21] These proteins have been shown to be involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis in cancer. Our study demonstrated that expression of a protein involved in necroptosis exhibits prognostic value in ovarian cancer patients, suggesting that necroptosis may play an important role in determining cancer cell death and patient outcome with chemotherapy. Future studies need to evaluate the association between MLKL and other prognostic biomarkers and may identify a prognostic panel including multiple prognostic biomarkers in ovarian cancer patients.",

This study suggests that MLKL may serve as a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer patients. However, since relatively little is known about the detailed role of MLKL in necroptosis or in other signaling pathways, future studies need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MLKL in cancer cell death with chemotherapy.  that cisplatin can induce both apoptosis and necrosis in cancer cells, which is dependent on the profile of proteins involved in cell death and cell cycle. 17,18 Because MLKL was a key mediator in necroptosis signaling, low expression of MLKL may suggest decreased necroptosis signaling in patients with chemotherapy. Thus, one possible underlying mechanism for the association of low MLKL expression with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients may be a result of decreased necroptosis signaling in these patients. In the future, it would be interesting to examine the necroptosis-specific",
