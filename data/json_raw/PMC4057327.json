            "text": "A functional polycation nanonetwork was developed for delivery of water soluble chemotherapeutic agents. The complexes of polyethyleneimine grafted methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEI-g-mPEG) and Zn 2+ were utilized as the micellar template for cross-linking with dithiodipropionic acid, followed by an acidic pH dialysis to remove the metal ion from the micellar template. The synthesis method was optimized according to pH, the molar ratio of Zn 2+ , and the cross-link ratio. The atomic force microscopy showed soft, discrete, and uniform nano-networks. They were sensitive to the simulated reductive environment as determined by Ellman's assay. They showed few positive \u03b6 potential and an average hydrodynamic diameter of 162\u00b110 nm, which decreased to 49\u00b111 nm upon dehydration. The ionic character of the nano-networks allowed the achievement of a higher-loading capacity of methotrexate (MTX), approximately 57% weight per weight, depending on the cross-link and the drug feed ratios. The nano-networks actively loaded with MTX presented some suitable properties, such as the hydrodynamic size of 117\u00b116 nm, polydispersity index of 0.22, and a prolonged swelling-controlled release profile over 24 hours that boosted following reductive activation of the nanonetwork biodegradation. Unlike the PEI ionomer, the nano-networks provided an acceptable cytotoxicity profile. The drug-loaded nano-networks exhibited more specific cytotoxicity against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells if compared to free MTX at concentrations above 1 \u00b5M. The enhanced antitumor activity in vitro might be attributed to endocytic entry of MTX-loaded nano-networks that was found in the epifluorescence microscopy experiment for the fluorophore-labeled nano-networks.",

            "text": "The colloidal stability of ionomer complexes is highly dependent on the environmental parameters, such as pH and ionic strength. 23 The low structural stability of ionomer micelles in biological media could be problematic for their biomedical applications. Thus, there is an interest in the stabilization of ionomer micelles by introducing cross-links between the polymer chains, either within the core domain or throughout the corona layer. Bronich et al 14,19 developed a procedure in which ionomer micelles were initially prepared by the self-assembly of the ionic blocks of PEO-bpolymethacrylic acid (PMA) or pluronic-PAA copolymers with an oppositely charged condensing agent (Ca 2+ ) that was followed by the chemical cross-linking of the ionic blocks in the core by ethylenediamine. Similarly, reversible core-crosslinked micelles were synthesized with cystamine. 15 Branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a cationic polyelectrolyte that contains primary, secondary and tertiary amino groups with the average pKa value between 8.5-9. 24 The polymer has a high content of amine nitrogen able to donate electrons and coordinate with transition metal ions. 25,26 This property may be applied for the immobilization of proteins and enzymes, [27][28][29] anchoring metal nanoparticles, 30 or drug delivery. 31,32 Different authors have reported ionomer complex micelles of PEI grafted with methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) and anionic surfactants, 9,33 metal ions (AuCl 3 or PtCl 6 2-), 26,34 oligonucleotides, 35 or plasmid DNA. 36 The covalent attachment of mPEG is commonly used to improve aqueous solubility and to reduce immunogenicity and cytotoxicity of polymeric systems. 37,38 The different copolymers of PEI and mPEG form PEI ionomers with a hydrophilic steric shield, which improves the stability of the PEI complexes and prevents aggregation. 39 The mPEG-grafted PEI has been shown to display decreased interactions with proteins, a reduced activation of the complement system, and an enhanced circulation time in the bloodstream. 40 Moreover, less safety problems are associated with mPEG grafted than unmodified polymers in vitro and in vivo. 41 Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most widely studied and effective therapeutic agents available to treat many solid tumors, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune diseases; 42 however, the poor pharmacokinetics, the narrow safety margin, and the impaired cellular uptake of the drug have limited the therapeutic outcomes of conventional delivery systems. Large amounts of the administrated MTX are eliminated by the kidneys within a short period of time, resulting in a short plasma half-life of 5-8 hours and a low drug concentration in target tissues. 43 Increasing the dose of MTX may result in a higher therapeutic efficacy, but it also leads to a higher risk of side effects; 44,45 moreover, MTX resistance appears due to impaired cellular uptake. 46 For an improved MTX delivery, several unique pathophysiological features of the diseases can be used either as targets or as tools for drug delivery, such as angiogenesis, 47,48 enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, 49 acidosis, and the expression of specific antigens and receptors. 50,51 Some delivery systems have been developed to improve the pitfalls of MTX therapy that ranged from polymeric conjugates, such as human serum albumin, liposomes, microspheres, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, polymeric micelles, in situ forming hydrogels, carrier erythrocyte, and nanotechnology-based materials, including carbon nanotubes, magnetic nanoparticles, and gold nanoparticles. They are successful in providing a prolonged and nonfluctuating plasma profile or an enhanced activity in vitro and in vivo; nevertheless, many of them still need different complementary studies to fine-tune the carrier in terms of pharmaceutical properties, as well as safety and efficacy. 52 Following our recent study on the synthesis of homogeneous nano-networks via the core cross-linking of the complexes of Zn 2+ and the PEI ionomer and the subsequent removal of Zn 2+ from the micellar template, 53 we aimed to study the application of the developed carrier for the active encapsulation and delivery of MTX in vitro. The effect of different physicochemical and formulation parameters was investigated on colloidal (particle size distribution and morphology) and pharmaceutical (drug-loading and release kinetic) properties of the MTX-loaded nano-networks. It was hypothesized that the cross-linked polyamines core of the nano-networks can encapsulate the negatively charged chemotherapeutic agents, such as MTX, efficiently.",

The reaction media were supplemented with 1% triethylamine and the required volumes of methanol to obtain the constant volume ratio of methanol/DCM of 2:1. Then, the vessels were incubated for 3 hours while mixing at 25\u00b0C. The products were concentrated using rotational speed-vacuum (RVC 2-18; Martin Christ GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany) until a yellowish white wax was obtained. The reconstituted products in deionized water were dialyzed using the Float-A-Lyzer 6-8 kDa (Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, the product solutions were lyophilized (Alpha 1-2 LD; Martin Christ GmbH). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR) spectroscopy was performed for the characterization of the PEI ionomer. It showed multiple peaks at 2.3-3.1 ppm attributed to the ethyleneimine proton and the peak of the ethylene glycol proton at 3.6 ppm in deuterium oxide (D 2 O) (data not shown). Relative yields of the reactions were about 86%-100%.",

A relatively high level of the molar ratio of Zn 2+ resulted in more homogeneous particles that might occur due to the crosslink action of Zn 2+ , though the PDI values were still high. An increase of the salt concentration brought about a higher PDI at the low level of Zn 2+ ; however, the lowest PDI was attained at the high level of salt concentration (150 mM) if the molar ratio of Zn 2+ was 0.4. This controversial effect of salt concentration might be due to displacement of Zn 2+ from their complexes at the high NaCl concentration during the phaseseparation step. This phenomenon was reported previously for PEO-g-PEI/surfactant complexes. 60,61 Nevertheless, the salt might stabilize the lyophobic complexes of Zn 2+ at the molar ratio of 0.4, possibly through the formation of the salt bridges on the interface of the lyophobic complexes.",

Following the reaction, acid dialysis was performed to remove Zn 2+ . The 1 H-NMR spectra of the nano-networks showed the total integral intensity of the signals due to \u2212S\u2212CH 2 CH 2 \u2212C=O protons of DTDP (m, \u03b4: 2.4-2.9) increased by the cross-link ratio in comparison to the ethylene glycol peak of the PEI ionomers in the swollen state (data not shown). The estimated degree of cross-links per primary amines with the nominal cross-link ratio of 0.3 was calculated as 7.36%. This value gradually increased and reached 15.72% for the nominal cross-linking ratio of 1.2. It is noteworthy to mention that DTDP can also form a loop within a single chain; therefore, the calculated degrees of cross-linking can be overestimated. Figure 3A shows the sizes increased after removing Zn 2+ to about 150-250 nm at the relatively lower cross-link ratios (0.3 and 0.6). These observations are consistent with the swelling nature of the nano-networks. It was understood from Table 2 that the average volumes of the swollen nanonetworks changed more than ten times upon the removal of Zn 2+ at C=0.3, while the volumes exhibited only a modest increase at the higher ratios compared to those of the precursor complexes of Zn 2+ and PEI ionomer. The average sizes of the nano-networks decreased by increasing C from 0.3-1.2.",

This could be explained by an increase of the hydrophobicity of PEI ionomer/Zn 2+ complexes, due to the amide bond formation mediated by DTDP and the failure of the mPEG chains to prevent aggregation. Figure 3B shows that an increase of PDI happened upon the removal of Zn 2+ that was less pronounced at C=0.6. The changes of PDI could be explained by the positive physical cross-link action of Zn 2+ , which disappeared after acid dialysis. Taking into consideration these results, the synthesis method produces a hydrophilic network with a relatively more uniform population of small particles if compared to other methods, such as polyionic complexation, desolvation, emulsion droplet coalescence, and direct cross-linking. 62 remote loading of MTX MTX, a weak bicarboxylic acid with pKa values of 3.8 and 4.8, could be immobilized into the PEI nano-networks (apparent pKa approximately 8.5) by the simple mixing of the MTX solution with the aqueous dispersions of the nano-networks. Although it seems that the MTX loading was mainly governed through electrostatic charge complexation, we cannot exclude the possibility that the drug molecules can be physically entrapped and retained in the networks, due to nonspecific hydrophobic interactions. Table 3 shows full-factorial design optimization of the MTX loading into the nano-networks. The drug loading was expressed as a function of pH, C and the R in terms of the loading efficiency (LE%) and the loading capacity (LC%). The results of analysis of variance revealed that MTX loading follows the two-factor interaction statistical model (P,0.0001 similarly for LE% and LC%). The main effects of C and R and their interaction (C \u00d7 R) were determined as the significant terms included in the corresponding models.  Figure 4A shows that an increase of R led to a significant decline of LE% of the PEI ionomer (P=0.001), while LE% was little changed by R for the nano-networks; however, Figure 4B shows that LC% was almost constant for the PEI ionomer (P\ue02e0.05), but increased for the nano-networks (P=0.001). The increase was more pronounced for R in the range of 0.15 and 0.30, but less at R=0.6, possibly due to reduced binding sites for MTX loading.",

Upon adsorption of the nano-networks on a glass surface, they exhibited a high aspect ratio, suggesting that the particles were flattened on the substrate as previously addressed. 59 In vitro release study Figure 6 shows the release profiles of the MTX loaded nano-networks (C=0.6; R=0.3) in isotonic-balanced release media (pH 5.5 or 7.5 + 140 mM NaCl). A prolonged release of MTX achieved over 24 hours is consistent with the previous reports of a sustained MTX release for 8-24 hours. 65,66 No burst release or very significant lag-time was recognized (P\ue02e0.05) for the MTX-loaded nano-networks if compared to free MTX, although the initial burst behavior has been reported in several studies, due to the fast escape of the free MTX out of the nanoparticles. 67,68 The better control of the initial burst release might be explained by the formation of a core-enriched model of an active MTX loading within the closely packed amine moieties. The release data were analyzed, according to the mathematical power function (Korsmeyer-Peppas model) to understand the mechanisms by which the drug release happened and to calculate the corresponding constants ( Table 5). The MTX release was determined swelling-controlled, that means the reduced drug concentration gradient over the time period was compensated by an increased swelling of the nano-network which happens following MTX release. It was found that the nano-networks show a control over the MTX release, since n was calculated to be near the value of one, especially at the physiologic pH of 7.5. It could be explained by the reservoir action of the nanonetwork for the negatively charged molecules, such as MTX. The effect of pH and the cross-linking reaction on the rate constant (K) and n were not found significant (P\ue02e0.05). MTX is a weak acidic drug that exhibits more solubility at pH 7.5 than at 5.5. The lower solubility of MTX at the acidic environment of inflamed tissues can be considered as a hurdle for the delivery of MTX. The negative solubility behavior of MTX was improved most likely by a pronounced swelling of the nano-networks that compensates the reduced solubility of the drug in the relatively acidic pH of 5.5.",

            "text": "MTT assay is a sensitive method for determination of the cytotoxicity of nanostructures, since they primarily exert toxicity on the mitochondrial compartment following cellular internalization. 70 The assay was performed to compare cytotoxicity of native PEI, the PEI ionomer, or the nano-networks at C=0.3 (cross-linked 1) or C=0.6 (crosslinked 2) in the HepG2 cell line after incubation for 24 hours ( Figure 8A). PEI demonstrated a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity while the PEI ionomer showed a reduced cytotoxic effect. In contrast, the nano-networks showed practically no cytotoxic effect at concentrations below 100 \u00b5g/mL. This interesting result could be explained by the substantially reduced \u03b6-potentials of the nano-networks and the shielding effect of the mPEG shell, as discussed by different authors. 71,72 Prior to evaluating the activity of the MTX-loaded nanonetworks, the cytotoxicity of free MTX was studied as a function of the drug concentration after 24, 48, and 72 hours ( Figure 8B). The incubation of HepG2 cells with increasing concentrations of MTX in the range of 0.1-100 \u00b5M did not result in significant changes in cell viability at each time interval; however, a time-dependent cytotoxic effect was observed (P,0.001), as previously reported, 73 since MTX is a cytostatic chemotherapeutic agent that mainly inhibits cell proliferation. The toxicity on HepG2 cells was augmented for the MTX loaded in the nano-networks (P,0.05), especially at the concentrations above 1 \u00b5M ( Figure 8C), though the empty nano-networks did not demonstrate cytotoxicity. The finding might be related to the mechanisms by which free MTX transports into cells. The cellular entry of MTX is restricted to saturable mechanisms, such as the reduced folate transmembrane carrier and the folate receptor. 74 Unlike free MTX, the MTX-loaded nano-networks can enter the cells via a parallel endocytic pathway. Moreover, the drug molecules that escaped from the endosomal compartment are less accessible to efflux pumps; therefore, a higher cellular accumulation of MTX and an enhanced cytotoxicity can be achieved. The issue was similarly addressed for different nanoparticulate systems. 75,76 ",

The nano-networks exhibited some appropriate pharmaceutical properties, such as small sizes, uniformity, globular morphology, and flexibility without using high shear forces or organic solvents for manipulation. They were able to accommodate negatively charged molecules, such as MTX, efficiently featured with a higher encapsulation capacity than the corresponding polyionic micelles and a prolonged MTX release in a swelling-controlled manner; moreover, the strategy of reductive activation of nanonetwork biodegradation boosted the release rate in the simulated intracellular medium. Taken together, these observations and the enhanced antitumor activity in vitro might imply the potential application of the nano-networks for the successful delivery of MTX that should be tested in vivo.",
