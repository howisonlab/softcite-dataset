Knowledge on factors associated with disallowance could improve the practice of compulsory mental health care. This study aims to examine such factors, placing particular emphasis on the impact of referring agents. Method: This study utilized data from the prospective, longitudinal cohort study 'Suicidality in Psychiatric Emergency Admissions' conducted at a Norwegian psychiatric emergency unit which served approximately 400 000 inhabitants. Data on referral, admission and patient characteristics were retrieved on compulsory admissions conducted between 1 May 2005 and 30 April 2008. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses and structural multilevel modelling were performed. Results: Among 2813 compulsory admissions, 764 were disallowed. Low competence in the referring agent, high GAF S score, observed alcohol or drug intoxication, reported suicide risk, and the presence of neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders, personality disorders and other non-specified diagnoses were associated with above average disallowance frequency. Non-Norwegian ethnicity and schizophrenia spectrum disorders were associated with below average disallowance rates. Conclusion: Among several factors associated with disallowance, low symptom load was the strongest, whilst referring agent competence modestly affected disallowance rate.",

It is practised under the presumed ethical justification that the negative consequences of compulsory mental health care on autonomy, integrity and comfort are outweighed by the benefits of treatment or protection (1). There is considerable interdisciplinary agreement that under certain conditions involuntary measures are justifiable (2). However, there is yet no international consensus on which conditions to apply, in spite of attempts to standardize the practice (3). The subject remains controversial.",

In Norway, severely mentally ill patients may be placed under such care when voluntary treatment has either failed or been deemed futile. Two medical examinations are required. Both must conclude that the patient is (i) a danger to themselves and/or (ii) a danger to others and/or (iii) in a condition that is likely to worsen substantially, or their chance of recovery is reduced in the absence of treatment (5). The first examination often takes place in primary health care and is performed by a physician unaffiliated to the admitting institution (6). If the physician finds the requirements met, the patient is referred and admitted, by force if necessary. The second medical examination takes place at the admitting institution. Within 24 h after admission, a psychiatrist or an authorized specialist in clinical psychology, hereafter referred to as 'specialist', must decide whether to establish compulsory mental health care or not. This decision is based on the findings from the examination, in addition to information from observations in the ward, findings from previous examinations and other available information. If the specialist decides not to establish it, the patient is admitted voluntarily or discharged (Norwegian underkjenning). Hereafter, such outcome will be referred to as 'disallowed referral' for compulsory mental health care or as 'disallowance'.",

Admissions of patients who were sentenced to civil commitment or transferred from other wards or institutions were excluded since disallowance was not a possible outcome in those cases. In this time period, approximately 95% of all adult patients in the catchment area who were referred for emergency psychiatric admission were received at this psychiatric emergency unit (6). They were assessed and given emergency treatment at the unit before discharge or transfer to other wards for long-term treatment. The remaining 5% were wellknown patients who were directly admitted to open wards, without an initial stay at the emergency unit.",

Additionally, the opportunity to ensure follow-up of the patient, for example by observation when in doubt, could affect the urgency of a final decision and was therefore also included as a key factor. Services that were expected to hold similar properties were merged to form single categories or competence levels, as shown under 'included services' in Table 1. Emergency specialist psychiatric care was held apart from other specialist psychiatric services because, although holding the same level of expertise, clinicians in this service would normally have no or scarce previous knowledge of the patient and no opportunity for follow-up. Emergency primary health care was in many cases staffed by general practitioners, and Table 1 thus reflects a similar level of expertise in these two agents. However, the circumstances in the two services differ substantially as previous knowledge of patient and follow-up availability is absent or scarce in emergency primary health care, whilst general practitioners mostly know and are obliged to follow up their enlisted patients. For the analyses, the resulting table was applied as a scale variable, hereafter referred to as 'referring agent competence' or simply 'competence'.",

Mplus 7.2 (Muth en & Muth en, Los Angeles, CA, USA) was used for structural multilevel modelling, with logistic regression to estimate associations between the included predictors and the dichotomous outcome variable, disallowance. Admission-specific predictors were analysed as level 1 variables, whilst level 2 included static patient factors. Hence, at level 2, patient-dependent mean values for disallowance were used in the statistical analyses. Competence and GAF F were expected to be predicted by other variables and were therefore modelled as intermediating variables. The standardized and unstandardized regression coefficients were reported as well as odds ratio values for the dichotomous disallowance variable. Robust maximum likelihood estimator was used to adjust for deviations from normal distributions. By a linear regression function, GAF F was regressed on GAF S, admission count, suicide risk and diagnosis variables. The GAF variables were originally continuous variables ranging from 0 to 100. Ahead of the multivariate analyses, the range in these variables was reduced by dividing by 10. Competence level was predicted by GAF F and GAF S, alcohol or drug intoxication, some diagnostic groups and cross-level interactions between gender and GAF scores. The main outcome variable, disallowance, was predicted by competence, GAF S, diagnostic group variables, suicide risk and alcohol or drug intoxication.",

This was in large part due to the similarity between GAF F and GAF S (12), demonstrated in the results by a strong association between these two factors. The apparently inverse correlation between GAF S and disallowance was the most robust relation in the model. Correspondingly, GAF score was one of two significant predictors of a comparable outcome among African American youth (15). Furthermore, the results showed that when patients with diagnoses of neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders or personality disorders were admitted, the likelihood of disallowance was elevated. These diagnostic groups are associated with lower mean symptom load than, for example, schizophrenia disorders, bipolar disorders and severe depression. In summary, several associations served to indicate that compulsory referrals of individuals with relatively low symptom load were at increased likelihood of being disallowed. This could imply that more emphasis should be put on symptom load when considering compulsory referrals of mentally ill patients.",

Accordingly, referring agents that were given a low score on the key factors 'knowledge of patients' and 'follow-up availability' had the highest rates of disallowance. This provides some support to the appeal that severely mentally ill patients should be referred through institutions where they are already known (14). In comparison, the third key factor, expertise, appeared to be of less impact on disallowance rate. This seems to differ from reports of substantial differences in assessment accuracy between healthcare personnel found in an Australian study, where professional expertise appeared to be an important factor (9). In our study, however, all referring clinicians were physicians. Hence, the subtle impact of diverging psychiatric expertise on disallowance rate could have been a result of the physicians' communal general training. Perhaps, when the assessor possesses a certain level of training, a further increase in the quality of referral assessments could be achieved by improving judgement of specific patient traits, for example symptom load and suicidality (16).",

Thus, patient selection probably accounted for part of the variation in disallowance rate between competence levels. It seemed that although referring agents had different features, only a subtle part of the variation in disallowance likelihood was attributable to those differences. This appears contrary to previous reports where traits held by the referring agents significantly impacted the referral pattern. However, most other studies investigated general referrals for psychiatric care (17) or involuntary referrals, without investigating eventual disallowance rates (14).

This might be appropriate overtriage, preventing fatal outcomes. However, it could also reflect the clinicians' uncertainty in judging risk of suicide. Policy makers in institutions and individual clinicians alike should discuss the benefits of hedging against adverse outcomes vs. the risk of unwarranted compulsory referrals. Additionally, training and application of structured assessments could increase assessment confidence in healthcare professionals and contribute to preventing unwarranted referrals (16,19).",

Accordingly, a decreased rate of disallowance was perhaps a natural consequence of more severe illness at presentation. These findings appeared in line with the findings regarding symptom load in this study. Additionally, communication problems can interfere with psychiatric assessments (23), necessitating compulsory observation, thus reducing the disallowance rate.
