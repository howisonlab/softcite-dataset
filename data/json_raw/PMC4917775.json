Overview of Literature: Few articles have addressed the impact of neurological recovery in patients with tuberculosis who were treated by two different operative methods via the posterior-only approach. Methods: Clinical and radiographic results of one-stage posterior instrumented spinal fusion for treatment of tuberculous spondylodiscitis with neurological deficits were reviewed and analyzed from 2009 to 2013. The extensive (E) group consisted of patients who received transforaminal debridement and interbody fusion, whereas transpedicular decompression was performed on limited (L) group. Rapid recovery was improvement of at least one Frankel grade within 6 weeks after operation. Otherwise, it was slow recovery. Results: All 39 patients had improved neurological signs. The median follow-up period was 24 months. Proportionately younger patients (under 65 years of age) received extensive surgery (15 of 18, 83.3% vs. 11 of 21, 52.4%; p=0.04). The mean operative time and blood loss in the group E were higher than in the group L (both p<0.01). With regard to type of procedure, especially at thoracic and thoracolumbar spine, patients who underwent extensive surgery had rapid neurological recovery significantly different from those of limited surgery (p=0.01; Relative Risk, 3.06; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.13 to 8.29). Conclusions: Transforaminal debridement and interbody fusion provides more rapid neurological recovery in patients with thoracic and thoracolumbar spinal tuberculosis compared to transpedicular decompression.",

            "text": "Spinal tuberculosis accounts for approximately 50% to 66% of all cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis and imaging is important for characterizing lesions, as osteolytic patterns and destructive behaviors likely to produce ky-phosis and instability [1,2]. The response to non-operative treatment is occasionally slow and kyphotic deformity is likely to progress during the follow-up period [3]. Therefore, surgery is superior, particularly in cases when nonoperative management has failed or severe kyphosis/ instability has developed with or without neurological deficit [4,5]. Anterior radical surgery (i.e., the Hong Kong operation) for spinal tuberculosis reported by Hodgson and Stock has been considered the gold standard [6,7]. The most important advantage of the traditional approach is that it allows a full radical resection of the infectious focus [5]. However, a review of the recent literature shows the evidence supporting autofusion of anterior spinal segment affected by tuberculous (TB) disease can be obtained without anterior surgery [8][9][10][11].",

Laminectomy was done and the entire space between the medial walls of the pedicles was exposed. Articular process removal and pediculectomy on the severely affected side of lesion were performed to reach the diseased portion of vertebral bodies. Unilateral costotransversectomy was utilized in thoracic spines and thoracic nerve roots on the focal level were sacrificed for better exposure. In lumbar lesions, sufficient exposure for debridement was obtained deliberately by unilateral total facetectomy. The location of the lumbar nerve root was identified to ensure that postoperative nerve palsy would not be encountered from iatrogenic injury. Curettes and burr drills were used to remove lesions including the infected vertebral body sequestrum, necrotic intervertebral disc, pus and caseous granulation tissue as thoroughly as possible. Autogenous corticocancellous chips were placed around the anterior two-thirds of the space created by debridement and a tricortical iliac bone graft was inserted to reconstruct the anterior column. Finally, posterolateral arthrodesis of the instrumented levels with local autologous bone was undertaken (Fig. 1).",

Initial VBL was significantly higher in group E vs. group L (0.6, IQR 0.5 to 1.1 vs. 0.4, IQR 0.2 to 0.7; p=0.02). The mean correction of sagittal index and the final loss of correction in both groups showed significant differences (both p<0.01). Anywise, the differences between the groups were not statistically significant. All the patients demonstrated solid fusion at the 12-month follow-up. The E group had a significantly higher incidence of respiratory complications according to the using of postoperative ventilator when compared to the L group (61.1% vs. 23.8%, p=0.02), although the incidence of overall perioperative complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the results of a comparative analysis between the groups. In group L, pseudarthrosis was suspected in one case due to broken rods which was observed on plain radiograph 4 months after surgery. This patient did not complain of any back pain or pain in his legs while posterolateral fusion was still achieved radiographically by the longer time of greater than 12 months of follow-up; threedimensional reconstructions of computed tomography scan were used to confirm fusion evidence in this 29-yearold male patient at 24 months postoperatively (Fig. 2). Another patient from group L (a 64-year-old male) was recommended to undergo repeated operation when a kyphotic deformity of adjacent segment abruptly progressed and the sites of noncontiguous relapse were seen on magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan 12 months after surgery, but he refused reoperation. Eventually, he was treated successfully with anti-TB drugs that extended an extra 12 months of therapy.",

            "text": "The surgical trend for Pott's paraplegia has constantly evolving as modern posterior spinal instrumentation which provides immediate stability and allows rapid patient mobilization [24]. With the minimal risk of anesthesia and with the less invasive spinal techniques, several investigators have started to report a wide variety of surgical procedures from this posterior approach and fixation to the treatment of TB spondylitis [8,[10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. Moreover, with the evidence suggesting that TB lesions that almost always affect the anterior column may achieve spontaneous fusion, the posterior approach represents a possible alternative surgical procedure in patients with less involved spinal tuberculosis [9,10]. Several spinal surgeons have advocated primary placement of transpedicular instrumentation for providing posterior stability and recovering activities of daily living after the operation [24]. Additionally, posterior pedicle screw instrumentation with fusion may be able to encourage neurological recovery because rigid stabilization enhances neurological improvement in traumatic spinal cord injury [25]. In the past, studies comparing the posterior approach with the anterior approach for spinal tuberculosis observed no difference in the outcomes between groups. Pu et al. [13], investigated 47 cases of thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis patients; 25 cases were treated by posterior debridement combined with interbody bone grafting and instrumentation, and the loss of kyphosis correction was also present in both groups (6.1\u00b0 vs. 4.6\u00b0 in posterior and anterior groups respectively). Lee et al. [15] studied 17 individuals with established TB on thoracic and thora- columbar spine and reported that two or more vertebrae were involved in 94% of the patients, 10 of whom had undergone single-stage transpedicular decompression and posterior instrumentation. When the angle of kyphosis was <30\u00b0, significant kyphosis correction was found. But, the loss of correction was considerable in both groups (6.1\u00b0 and 4.5\u00b0 in posterior and anterior group, respectively).",

[12] studied 14 patients with upper thoracic tuberculosis; excellent neurological results were observed after one-stage debridement, combined interbody and instrumented fusion via posterior-only approach, and there was no significant loss of deformity correction at the final follow-up, with loss of correction being only 1.3\u00b0. The reasons for higher correction loss in the present study might be that TB lesions were not confined to only one segment, and placement of pedicle screws were attempted to fix inside the pedicle of the pathological vertebral body to reduce the extent of fixation, and also preserve more motion segments at the lumbar level [10]. The radiographic superiority of one-stage circumferential fusion using cage, especially in patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis, might result in more favorable long-term outcome [26]. Similar findings were also published by other researchers, while the total operative time was longer, blood loss was higher and the titanium mesh cage that was used was more costly in cases of circumferential fusion [27,28]. We offer several thoughts concerning the current onestage posterior surgery performed as follows. The pos-  terior approach was relatively uncomplicated. The longsegment instrumentation and posterolateral fusion could be successfully obtained stability in such a way that the spinal cord or nerve roots were not irritated and may promote efficient neurological recovery, thereby increasing mobility to hospitalized patients and decreasing complications of being in bed. The extensive clearance of caseous tissues that cause inflammatory response correlated with rapidly progressing recovery of function. Finally, the abrupt reduction of inflammation of neural elements was related to the improvement of disease activity and neurological grading.",

The overall incidence of complications in the two groups was not statistically different. But, the incidence of postoperative mechanical ventilation was significantly higher in group E compared with group L. This difference might be due to more complicated operative process, longer operative time and higher blood loss. Furthermore, the improvement in VAS scores on weeks 2 after surgery was significantly lesser in the E group. This might be because postoperative pain was slowly reduced for extensive surgery. The determination according to the type of the surgery should be individualized depending on the basis of the patient's general condition. Transforaminal approach in combination with internal fixation and posterolateral fusion with placement of interbody graft procedures were reserved for young (age <65 years) patients who could tolerate more complex reconstructive surgery. Performed extensively, these surgical procedures were suitable with lesions at spinal cord level because of wider exposure and more aggressive debridement of all infected tissues. So it might be assumed that there is the likely benefit of surgery to relieve myelopathy; rapid early neurological recovery was presently evident. Limited surgery with posterior transpedicular decompression in combination with pedicle screw instrumentation and posterolateral fusion procedures were better suited to less destructive forms of TB in aging adults with multiple comorbidities. Lastly and most importantly, completion of a full course anti-TB therapy and surgeon's surgical experience were the two key points to achieve success in reaching the goals of the treatment, regardless of the type of operation.",

The combination of extensive resection and stable reconstruction with interbody autografting via posterior-only approach seems to accelerate neurological recovery in thoracic and thoracolumbar spinal tuberculosis. Patients with poor general medical condition achieve acceptable neurological outcomes and kyphosis correction by shorter operative time and less blood loss through transpedicular decompression with instrumentation techniques.",
