            "text": "Articular cartilage defects are a major clinical burden worldwide. Current methods to repair bone defects include bone autografts, allografts and external fixation. In recent years, the repair of bone defects by tissue engineering has emerged as a promising approach. The present study aimed to assess a novel method using a biological reactor with platelet-rich plasma to construct tissue-engineered bone. Beagle bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated and differentiated into osteoblasts and chondroblasts using platelet-rich plasma and tricalcium phosphate scaffolds cultured in a bioreactor for 3 weeks. The cell scaffold composites were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and implanted into beagles with articular cartilage defects. The expression of osteogenic markers, alkaline phosphatase and bone \u03b3-carboxyglutamate protein (BGLAP) were assessed using polymerase chain reaction after 3 months. Articular cartilage specimens were observed histologically. Adhesion and distribution of BMSCs on the \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) scaffold were confirmed by SEM. Histological examination revealed that in vivo bone defects were largely repaired 12 weeks following implantation. The expression levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and BGLAP in the experimental groups were significantly elevated compared with the negative controls. BMSCs may be optimum seed cells for tissue engineering in bone repair. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) provides a rich source of cytokines to promote BMSC function. The \u03b2-TCP scaffold is advantageous for tissue engineering due to its biocompatibility and 3D structure that promotes cell adhesion, growth and differentiation. The tissue-engineered bone was constructed in a bioreactor using BMSCs, \u03b2-TCP scaffolds and PRP and displayed appropriate morphology and biological function. The present study provides an efficient method for the generation of tissue-engineered bone for cartilage repair, compared with previously used methods."

A previous study revealed that the application of a single growth factor was not sufficient to achieve the desired effect on BMSCs (10). The aforementioned proteins and growth factors have confirmed efficacy in the osteogenic induction in BMSCs (11). Several of these proteins are involved in wound healing and tissue regeneration (12)(13)(14)(15). Tissue engineering scaffolds are 3D substrates that provide the structural microenvironment required for the cultivation of BMSCs (14). Additionally, tissue engineering scaffolds are used in drug delivery, absorbable sutures, surgical orthopedic devices and cell tissue engineering applications (15). Porous bioceramics, such as \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP), are excellent scaffolds for tissue engineering; they are easy to combine with BMSCs, and are suitable for the repair of bone defects in articular cartilage injury (16). In the present study, BMSCs and \u03b2-TCP scaffolds were used in a perfusion bioreactor to simulate in vivo conditions that promote cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. The current study may present a novel platform for the generation of tissue-engineered bone that is suitable in bone-repair applications.",

            "text": "In the present study, autologous PRP was used as a cytokine source to promote bone formation. PRP is a concentrate of platelets in a small volume of plasma. Once activated by an agonist, growth factors contained in platelets may be released and exert their biological functions. The initial clinical study using PRP for bone reconstruction therapy was performed by Marx et al (17). In this randomized study, 88 patients with mandibular defects were treated with autogenous cancellous bone grafts with or without the addition of activated PRP. Both the radiographic and the histomorphometric evaluation revealed a significantly greater percentage of bone generated in the presence of PRP (17). PRP therefore appears to exert a positive effect in the early phase of bone healing in combination with autogenous cancellous bone grafts (21)(22)(23), and in diabetic fracture healing (24). Other studies support the hypothesis that PRP has the ability to promote bone healing (25,26) and strongly advocate its use in bone regenerative therapy (27,28). The identification of the potential of PRP in the promotion of bone regeneration in recent years has generated a novel field of research in orthopedics. The effect of PRP in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects in humans has also been investigated (29) and its beneficial effects in both periodontal and cosmetic surgical procedures have been suggested (30)(31)(32). In vitro studies have demonstrated the effects of platelet concentration on the proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblasts and fibroblasts (33,34). In two other in vivo studies (35,36), goat PRP was prepared and activated with bovine thrombin and calcium chloride. PRP is currently used clinically in several countries and curative effects have been achieved (36). In addition, it has been demonstrated that PRP may enhance the healing of osteochondral defects and that the benefits may be detected at early stages of the healing process (37,38). Froum et al (39) observed histomorphometric differences in bone regeneration among the samples of three surgical cases. Another study examining human PRP demonstrated upregulation of collagen synthesis in osteoblasts (39). Growth factors and BMSCs attract other progenitor cells or osteoclasts, and therefore initiate bone remodeling (40,41). It is accepted that, subsequent to a bone injury, growth factors and host precursors are released (42). In addition, cell adhesion to extracellular matrices is essential in the development, maintenance and remodeling of osseous tissues (42,43). The extracellular matrix component released by platelets is fibronectin, and the latter mediates adhesive interactions and has a central role in osteoblast survival, proliferation, differentiation and matrix mineralization, in addition to bone formation (44)(45)(46). The degranulation of PRP and release of growth factors may be achieved by the addition of thrombin in the presence of calcium chloride or by thawing the platelets (47). Studies have demonstrated that, in this combination, calcium sulfate acts as an activator of platelets and also as a delivery system for the platelet-released growth factors (48,49). Therefore, it may be concluded that the endogenous growth factors released by platelets promote the healing process.",

This composite was used in the repair of osteochondral defects in beagles. It was found that certain grafts did not completely integrate into the areas of bone cartilage defects, indicating that the constructed osteochondral composite was not completely vascularized. In the present study, in the process of bone construction in the three-dimensional perfusion bioreactor, autologous PRP was used as a cytokine source to promote bone formation and vascularization. Autologous PRP is a convenient, economical and sustainable source of high-quality cytokines. The novel method for constructing tissue-engineered bone using BMSCs, \u03b2-TCP scaffolds and PRP can construct efficient tissue-engineered bone for cartilage repair.",

SEM displayed good adhesion and distribution of BMSCs on the \u03b2-TCP scaffold. Concurrently, extracellular matrix secretion was observed on the scaffold. Favorable cell proliferation and morphology was also detected using SEM, suggesting that the \u03b2-TCP scaffold has a high affinity for BMSCs. In brief, \u03b2-TCP scaffolds display several benefits in tissue engineering which as as follows: i) The \u03b2-TCP scaffold is able to provide a 3D space that may support BMSC growth, expose cells to shear force and improve unit expansion rate, thus promoting the differentiation of cartilage and bone; ii) a 3D structure may improve the biocompatibility of scaffolds and promote adhesion of BMSCs; iii) bone inducing growth factors will be gradually released by \u03b2-TCP in the process of cell culture due to the characteristics of the material. Overall, the \u03b2-TCP scaffold may be able to synchronously improve all three of the basic components required for bone and cartilage engineering. However, although the present study indicates that the \u03b2-TCP scaffold is an efficient biomaterial for BMSC adhesion and chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation, further animal experiments are necessary to fully assess the scaffolds."

            "text": "The present study indicated that the use of a bioreactor and PRP was able to synergistically enhance cell proliferation and biosynthetic responses on scaffolds. Cell behavior is influenced by shear stress, tension and hydrostatic pressure stimulation. The continuous mechanical stimulation provided by the bioreactor, including shear stress stimulation, tension stimulation and hydrostatic pressure stimulation has effects on the morphology and function of BMSCs (51,52). In the present study, BMSCs were cultured on a 3D scaffold in a perfusion bioreactor, a culture model that possesses several advantages compared with traditional planar 2D culture models. Firstly, it may provide mechanical stimulation to the BMSCs promoting their functionality. Secondly, the use of a bioreactor improves the distribution of nutrients within the scaffold. In addition, using the bioreactor provided a 3D growth environment, which promotes cell adhesion, growth and differentiation simultaneously, thereby reducing the effect of contact inhibition between the cells. Furthermore, the culture medium in a 3D bioreactor does not need to be replaced frequently, while the medium in a traditional 2D cell culture model requires intermittent replacement. The predominant advantage of the system is a result of the mechanical stimulation provided by the flowing fluid that may synergistically enhance cell proliferation and biosynthetic response on scaffolds, which is able to simulate a cell stress environment highly similar to that observed in vivo (51)(52)(53). In addition, cells may be fully combined with, or adhered to, the scaffold materials in the bioreactor, making cell culture closer to physiologic 3D growth (54,55). The fluid shear stress provided by the bioreactor has a range of effects on cellular morphological and functional organization. It has previously been established that the fluid shear stress provided by a bioreactor is able to enhance the proliferation of MSCs (56). Notably, in the present study, it was revealed that PRP and the application of mechanical stimulation resulted in a greater number of cells and total collagen present on scaffolds after 21 days, compared with the use of PRP alone. The aforementioned findings suggested that mechanical stimulation is able to synergistically enhance cell proliferation and biosynthetic response on scaffolds. In addition, mechanical stimulation maintained the expression levels of ALP and BGLAP, the most important indicators of osteogenic differentiation (57). ALP has a critical role in the calcification process and has been used as a conventional marker of early osteoblast differentiation. BGLAP predominately appears in the mineralized formation as an indicator of osteoblast maturation. The expression levels of ALP and BGLAP therefore reflect the process of bone formation.",

The tissue-engineered bone constructed using this method displayed active biologic characteristics in morphology and in function, and may therefore provide an improved approach for the repair of osteochondral defects."
