            "text": "Background: Amenorrhea is a common adverse effect of treatment with antipsychotic medications that influences both fertility and adherence to medication regimens. Most research suggests that medication-induced prolactinemia is the main cause of amenorrhea but few prospective studies have assessed this hypothesis. Aim: Identify risk factors for amenorrhea following treatment with antipsychotic medication. Methods: The study used a prospective, nested case-control design. First-episode, drug na\u00efve female patients with schizophrenia who were in the middle of their menstrual cycle at the time of admission were enrolled. Serum levels of six reproductive hormones were assessed before and after a 12-week course of treatment with risperidone: progesterone, estradiol, prolactin, follicular stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone. The hormone levels of 31 patients who had no menstruation during the entire 12 weeks of treatment (the amenorrhea group) were compared to those of 31 age-matched subjects who had normal menstrual periods over the 12 weeks of treatment (the control group). Results: We found a dramatic 4-fold increase in prolactin levels in women of childbearing age treated with risperidone, but the pretreatment and posttreatment levels of prolactin were not different between patients who did and did not develop amenorrhea with treatment. However, there were significantly lower pretreatment levels of estradiol and progesterone in patients who subsequently developed amenorrhea with risperidone treatment than in patients who did not develop amenorrhea. A conditional logistic regression analysis found that pretreatment levels of estradiol remained significantly associated with the development of amenorrhea during treatment even when adjusting for the pretreatment levels of the other five reproductive hormones assessed. Conclusion: These findings do not support the suggestion that amenorrhea associated with the use of antipsychotic medication is the result of hyperprolactinemia. If our finding of the predictive power of pretreatment levels of estradiol is confirmed in larger studies, this information would be of use to clinicians in selecting antipsychotic medications for female patients with schizophrenia; patients at highest risk of developing amenorrhea could be preferentially treated with the medications that are at lowest risk of inducing amenorrhea.",

            "text": "Amenorrhea is a common side effect of treatment with antipsychotic medication that can affect both the fertility and compliance of female patients with schizophrenia. [1][2][3][4][5][6] Defining amenorrhea as three months or longer without menstrual periods in individuals who previously had regular menstrual cycles, a study in China reported amenorrhea in 11 to 35% of female patients being treated with various antipsychotic medications and found that risperidone was associated with higher rates of amenorrhea than other antipsychotics. [7] Amenorrhea is presumed to be caused by medicationinduced hyperprolactinemia, but only a minority of antipsychotic-treated patients with hyperprolactinemia develop amenorrhea. [1,2,[8][9][10] Other reports find that some female patients with schizophrenia have low levels of estrogen (estradiol), another potential cause of amenorrhea. [8,11,12] The risk factors and protective factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of amenorrhea in females treated with antipsychotic medications remain unknown. Identifying high-risk patients prior to the selection of an antipsychotic would help clinicians avoid the use of medications that are most likely to result in amenorrhea. Information about risk status for amenorrhea would also be useful in deciding whether or not to provide concurrent treatment with metformin, which has recently been proven to be effective in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced amenorrhea. [13] The current study uses a nested case-control design to compare pretreatment levels of reproductive hormones in first-episode, drug-na\u00efve female patients (with regular menses) with schizophrenia who do and do not subsequently develop amenorrhea during an initial 12-week course of treatment with risperidone.",

Almost all first-episode patients with schizophrenia were initially treated with risperidone, the most widely used antipsychotic medication in China. Initial doses of risperidone were gradually increased to therapeutic levels (2-6mg/d) over the first two weeks of treatment (based on the judgment of the treating clinician). The occurrence of side effects was assessed monthly using the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS).

These findings do not support the suggestion that amenorrhea associated with the use of antipsychotic medication is the result of hyperprolactinemia. [8][9][10] The most dramatic finding was the significantly lower pre-treatment level of estradiol in the patients who subsequently develop amenorrhea with risperidone treatment. This was a robust finding that persisted even when the pre-treatment levels of the other five reproductive hormones assessed were adjusted for in a conditional logistic regression model. We matched cases with controls by age, and had selected subjects without prior menstrual problems (specifically excluding those with polycystic ovarian syndrome who may have irregular menses [19] ) who had regular menses for at least six months prior to admission and who were all in the endometrial proliferation phase of their cycle, so it is unlikely that our results are confounded by differences in the menstrual history or menstrual phase of the subjects.",
