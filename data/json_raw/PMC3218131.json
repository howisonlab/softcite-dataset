The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the lymph node ratio (LNR) in patients with stage III colorectal cancer. Methods: We included 186 stage III colorectal cancer patients who underwent a curative resection over a 10-year period in one hospital. The cutoff point of LNR was chosen as 0.07 because there was significant survival difference at that LNR. The Kaplan-Meier and the Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the prognostic effect according to LNR. Results: There was statistically significant longer overall survival in the group of LNR > 0.07 than in the group of LNR \u2264 7 (P = 0.008). Especially, there was a survival difference for the N1 patients group (LN < 4) according to LNR (5-year survival of N1 patients was lower in the group of LNR > 0.07, P = 0.025), but there was no survival difference for the N2 group (4 \u2265 LN) according to LNR. The multivariate analysis showed that the LNR is an independent prognostic factor. Conclusions: LNR can be considered as a more accurate and potent modality for prognostic stratifications in patients with stage III colorectal cancer.",

As the survival rate has been shown to increase after adjuvant chemotherapy [2,3], the existence of lymph node metastasis is grounds for advocating postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Therefore, reporting the status of lymph nodes (both the number of nodes harvested and the number of metastatic lymph nodes) accurately is very critical in deciding the postoperative treatments and in giving a prognosis. However, the expected prognosis when determined by the number of metastatic lymph nodes is not consistent in the patients whose stage is same. In addition, it is difficult to determine lymph node metastasis objectively as lymph node metastasis depends on the individual characteristics of the patient, the competence of the surgeon and the ability of the pathologist to isolate and collect lymph nodes [4,5]. Current studies have found that the number of harvested lymph nodes is related to the disease-free and the overall survival rates of colorectal cancer patients [6][7][8]. In other words, a higher harvested lymph node number is associated with a higher survival rate in patients treated with a radical tumor resection [9,10].",

Earlier studies have shown that the prognostic factors for colorectal cancer are early detection, age at diagnosis, location of tumor, histological differentiation, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, preoperative and postoperative plasma carcino embryonic antigen level, and degree of venous and neural invasion. Of these factors, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and metastasis to other organs [1], as reflected in the current TNM staging (T, depth of invasion; N, lymph node metastasis; M, ported to be meaningful for reducing stage migration and for giving a prognosis for other types of solid cancers (stomach [11][12][13], breast [14], bladder [15], pancreas [16] and lung cancer [17]). Studies on the clinical meaning of the LNR as a prognostic factor have been performed for colorectal cancer patients [16,[18][19][20][21][22][23]. However, the clinical meaning of the LNR in colorectal cancer patients is still controversial as some researchers found no correlation between the LNR and the survival rate while others insisted that the LNR was a more critical prognostic factor than simple lymph node metastasis. Therefore, we conducted this study to determine whether the LNR is a stronger prognostic factor than the absolute number of metastatic lymph nodes in patients with stage III colorectal cancer.",

In the N1 group with three or less metastatic lymph nodes, the survival rate of the group with a LNR of less than 0.07 was significantly higher than that of the group with a LNR of 0.07 or greater. In the N2 group, the difference in the survival rates between the two groups was not significant. When colon cancer and rectal cancer were compared, the fiveyear survival rates of colon cancer patients were different with a LNR of 0.07 as the standard, but the difference did not have a statistical meaning (P = 0.143) (Fig. 4A). The rates of rectal cancer patients showed a statistically significant difference with the same standard (Fig. 4B). A multivariate analysis of the clinicopathological characteristics, which were found to be significant with a P-value of less than 0.05 on the univariate analysis, of stage III colorectal cancer patients revealed that LNR, T staging and neural invasion had a significant correlation with the prognosis. Of them, LNR was found to be one of the most critical prognostic factors, with an odds ratio of 4.3 (Table 3).",

            "text": "Amongst the prognostic factors, the depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and metastasis to other organs have been found to be closely related with the prognosis for colorectal cancer [1]. The status of lymph node metastasis has been recognized as the one factor exerting the strongest influence on the prognosis. However, the lymph node metastasis depends on the individual characteristics of the patient and the competence of the surgeon and the pathologist, thus making it difficult to assess the status accurately [4,5]. For example, more lymph nodes are harvested in young patients, females and thin patients when considering the demographic characteristics, from the right colon when considering the location of the tumor and at larger hospitals and by more experienced surgeons  in general [4,6,24,25]. In addition, lymph node metastasis is found through RT-PCR in patients without metastasis in the current TNM staging [26], and stage migration (reported first by Feinstein and called Will Rogers phenomenon; the current AJCC TNM staging says that the same number of metastatic lymph nodes leads to the same prognosis even though the numbers of harvested lymph nodes are different [27]) can be shown, even in stage III colorectal cancer patients, to cause a deviation in the survival rate when only the absolute number of metastatic lymph nodes is considered [18]. Because giving a prognosis for colorectal cancer based on the above criteria has led to some criticism, the concept of the LNR, which has been accepted as a clinically meaningful prognostic factor for other types of solid malignant tumors, has been introduced in studies on colorectal cancer [19][20][21][22][23]28].",

That shows that the patients divided by N staging based on the absolute number of metastatic lymph nodes are not distributed consistently and that the use of LNR, along with the current TNM staging, can give a better prognosis. Unlike our expectation, the fiveyear survival rates of the patients in N2 stage were not different by LNR ( Fig. 3B) and that is thought to have been due to cut off of 0.07 not being appropriate for showing a significant difference in the survival rates among the patients in N2 stage. This study compared the survival rate by LNR after dividing the colorectal cancer patients into colon cancer and rectal cancer patients. When the LNR (0.07) used for rectal cancer was applied to colon cancer, the accuracy of predicting the survival rate was slightly reduced (Fig. 4). A cut-off point to present a statistically significant difference in survival rate of colon cancer patients must be different from the value of 0.07 used for rectal cancer; thus, appropriate the cut-off points need to be determined to obtain a significant difference in the survival rate by the location of the tumor.",

This study also performed statistical analyses with the various cut-off points of the LNR applied in previous studies and found that 0.07 and 0.20, as suggested by Peschaud et al. [20], produced the largest difference in the survival rate when all patients were divided into three groups with the cut-off points. In each study, including this study, the survival rate, the diseasefree rate and cancer-related survival rate were significantly differ-ent among the patients classified by cut-off points. However, the studies utilized various cut-off points. Thus, if the LNR is to be used as a prognostic factor, a standardization of cut-off points for the LNR is necessary for stratification of stages with better correlation with the prognosis.",
