            "text": "Currently, there are no data available concerning quality-of-life outcomes and other long-term effects of intravenous versus oral iron therapy on anaemia during pregnancy. In addition to the physical impact of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) on pregnant women, [1][2][3] IDA is a potential risk factor for preterm delivery and subsequent low birth weight, and may be associated with inferior neonatal health. 3 4 Infants born to women with IDA are more likely to become anaemic themselves, which in turn is known to have a potential effect on an infant's mental and motor development. [5][6][7][8][9] Although iron supplementation during pregnancy is a widely practised public health measure, there are some concerns regarding iron replacement therapy and its long-term effect, especially the intravenous form. 10 11 Therapeutic response to oral iron therapy is not always adequate in pregnant women, due to difficulties associated with oral intake of the tablets and their side effects, which impacts negatively on compliance. 3 10 11 In the past, intravenous iron was associated with undesirable and sometimes serious side effects that limited its use. 12 Recently, new type II iron complexes have been developed with the potential to reverse iron deficiency with less side effects than their predecessors. [12][13][14] Despite increasing evidence for the safety of the newer preparations in both pregnant and general populations, intravenous iron continues to be underutilised. 15 Earlier, we reported on a randomised controlled trial (PMID: 20546462) of intravenous followed by oral iron therapy versus oral iron therapy only for moderate IDA in pregnancy. 14 The results of the earlier analysis showed that intravenous iron polymaltose was associated with greater improvements in haemoglobin (Hb) levels and iron stores compared to oral iron alone in pregnancy-related IDA. 14 Here, we report the results of a follow-up assessment of the same cohort of patients. We studied the effects of both treatment types on the perceived health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by a modified SF-36 questionnaire. The effect of iron therapy on breastfeeding rates and on the general well-being of the babies born to these women was measured by child growth charts set by the Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group (APEG).",

The oral-only treatment arm comprised iron sulphate 250 mg tablets once daily, (elemental iron 80 mg, Abbott, Australasia Pty Ltd) to be taken daily within 2 days after booking until delivery. The intravenous arm required a single intravenous infusion of iron polymaltose (Ferrosig, Sigma Pharmaceuticals, Sydney, NSW, Australia) within 1 week after first antenatal visit followed by oral iron identical to the other arm. Pre-enrolment, there were no significant differences in the dietary iron intake or supplement intake between the two groups based on a specially designed questionnaire addressing these issues. 14 Patients assigned to intravenous iron polymaltose received a 100 mg test dose dissolved in 50-100 ml normal saline infused over 30 min. Clinical observation and vital signs were assessed initially and every 15 min from the start of the infusion. After the test-dose was tolerated, the remainder of the iron polymaltose dose was infused. The total dose of intravenous iron polymaltose was calculated according to the patients' body weight at their first antenatal visit and entry Hb level according to the product guidelines; iron The primary hypothesis examined the change in haemoglobin levels between the time of booking and immediately prior to delivery; an 'intention-to-treat' analysis was performed according to original randomisation group on those patients who had blood samples taken before delivery, whether or not the treatment was completed as per the protocol. \u2021 Twenty-one patients withdrew from the trial treatments, and all but one of these patients agreed to continued collection of haematological and other trial data; eight patients gave no reason for withdrawal. \u00a7 Five patients did not complete the intended treatments, but did not choose to withdraw themselves; three patients in the oral iron group were treated with intravenous iron when their haemoglobin was judged not to have responded adequately to oral iron, while one patient was unable to attend for intravenous iron treatment.",

First, a clinical questionnaire was completed prospectively by trained midwives at 4 weeks after initiation of treatment, at 28 and 34 weeks gestation, and then 6-8 weeks postdelivery. This questionnaire assessed four aspects: energy levels, activity, tolerance and side effects of the treatment. This was used to guide individual patient clinical decision-making as well as to provide a safety audit of the trial treatments. 14 Second, a prospective/retrospective survey was conducted between June and October 2010 by trained research personnel via phone interview using a modified version of the SF-36 HRQoL questionnaire, similar to a version published previously. 16 17 Additional modifications for this study included: (1) use of eleven of the 36 questions (table 2) and (2) the women were asked to recall their response to each of the questions at four timepoints; pretrial prior to commencement of iron therapy during the pregnancy, 4 weeks after the start of iron therapy, 1 week after delivery and the last 4 weeks prior to the telephone questionnaire contact (table 2). This was compared in a retrospective manner to the same questions answered earlier prospectively by the participants at these different timepoints. In order to validate the retrospective use of the modified SF-36 questionnaire to assess the women's HRQoL during and after pregnancy, we estimated the associations of the physical activity component of the prospective monitoring questionnaire following entry into the trial with the Physical Component Scale values of the modified SF-36 at each of the timepoints. We hypothesised that the association would be greatest at 4 weeks after enrolment compared to trial entry, time of delivery or at the time of questionnaire completion. In addition, data concerning breastfeeding and the health of the child were collected from the baby's growth booklet. This included breastfeeding duration, baby gender, age, weight and previous hospitalisation, if any, in addition to the baby's sleep quality since birth and specific growth data for the children as set by the APEG. Hb and ferritin levels for participants at delivery were available for all participants; however, no further testing was performed during the follow-up.

There were no significant differences in demographic or iron status measurements between any of the groups of women recruited to the trial. All participants were Caucasians. As reported in the original study, 14 at delivery the proportion of women with lower than normal ferritin levels was 53 of 67 (79%) for women with analysable iron status measurements who were treated with oral iron as compared to 3 of 66 (4.5%) for women who received intravenous iron (Fisher's exact p<0.001). The pretreatment mean serum ferritin levels were low in both groups at 17 \u00b5g/l. However, the serum ferritin of those in the intravenous iron group increased markedly within 4 weeks of the intravenous therapy with a mean level of 222 \u00b5g/l; 95% CI 194 to 249 \u00b5g/l (p<0.001). This substantial improvement was maintained after delivery with a mean level of 108 \u00b5g/l; 95% CI 43 to 209 \u00b5g/l (p<0.001). 14 On the other hand, ferritin levels did not show a significant increase in the oral iron group through pregnancy and after delivery. Furthermore, the percentage of women at delivery with Hb levels <116 g/l was 29% (25 of 85) in the oral iron group versus 16% (14 of 87) in the intravenous iron group (p=0.04) incidence rate ratio 0.55 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.98; p=0.043). After delivery, the mean Hb levels declined to 111.6 g/l (SD 14.2) in the oral iron versus 115.5 g/l (SD 10.8) in the intravenous iron group. This showed a continuing favourable effect of intravenous iron therapy (95% CI 2.5 to 9.1; p=0.004) despite the loss of blood at delivery. 14 There were no significant differences in the birth weights of the babies in the two treatment groups, with an average birth weight of 3.42 kg in both groups with a difference of 0.03 kg ( p=0.77). There were also no differences in the gestational age at delivery in both treatment groups with a mean of 39.1 weeks in the oral iron versus 38.9 weeks in the intravenous iron group, with only a slight difference of 0.2 weeks ( p=0.74). There were no significant differences in placental cord Hb or ferritin levels in both treatment groups. The mean cord Hb was 165 g/l (SD 9.6) in the oral iron group versus 157 g/l (SD 14.1) in the intravenous iron group (difference \u22127; 95% CI \u221218 to 3; p=0.17).

There was a substantial improvement of iron status in women who received intravenous iron compared to oral iron as demonstrated during the trial analysis ( p<0.001). Limitations of our study include the modified questionnaire being in part a retrospective HRQoL evaluation that should ideally have been conducted within a shorter period of time. However, a correlation to a prospective evaluation of the studied subjects has been made in our study in order to overcome a possible recall bias. Therefore, we were able to minimise the number of retrospective questions, since the women were asked to recall their responses to each question at four different timepoints. The full SF-36 was impractical and may have been judged to be an excessive burden on the women. Thus, we attempted to provide a retrospective form of validation by showing that the clinical HRQoL questions in the physical domain, recorded prospectively at week 4 after trial, were most strongly associated with the Physical Component Scales of the recall of modified SF-36 at week 4 compared to the other timepoints. This indicates that the retrospective methodology was able to provide an acceptable degree of accuracy in the differentiation of HRQoL levels at different timepoints despite the concerns that may have arisen with this issue. The assumption being made is that the way those patients judge their physical and mental condition will be relatively stable over time, 18 an assumption with which we agree may occur in patients with chronic diseases. However, this assumption may not hold for women during and after pregnancy. The expectations by the woman about how she should be feeling at the different stages of pregnancy, around the time of delivery, and when she is caring for one or more young infant or child may differ substantially at those different timepoints. At least in our analysis, the judgement the woman is making about how to answer the questions is likely to be the same for each timepoint, since she had made that judgement at one point in time: the repeated measures analysis compares each woman with herself, thus substantially reducing the impact of variation between women in this judgement.",

Nevertheless, prior to our study there was a lack of research that addressed HRQoL during and after pregnancy, and particularly the association between iron status and postnatal clinical depression as well as breastfeeding duration in our cohort of patients provides a novel finding and a basis for further research. An incidental finding of our study was a trend for unfavourable mental health component outcomes for women with male babies. There is only a single report in the literature that addressed this issue and reported similar findings. 19 Perhaps this may be explained with the observation that male babies are usually more active, and this may be associated with postnatal depression. 19 However, due to lack of more detailed data, this issue should be addressed separately and studied in future research.",
