It contains over 3.7 million pages of content; with many pages written on scientific subject matters that include peerreviewed citations, yet are written in an accessible manner and generally reflect the consensus opinion of the community. In this, the 19th Annual Database Issue of Nucleic Acids Research, there are 11 articles that describe the use of a wiki in relation to a biological database. In this commentary, we discuss how biological databases can be integrated with Wikipedia, thereby utilising the pre-existing infrastructure, tools and above all, large community of authors (or Wikipedians). The limitations to the content that can be included in Wikipedia are highlighted, with examples drawn from articles found in this issue and other wiki-based resources, indicating why other wiki solutions are necessary. We discuss the merits of using open wikis, like Wikipedia, versus other models, with particular reference to potential vandalism. Finally, we raise the question about the future role of dedicated database biocurators in context of the thousands of crowdsourced, community annotations that are now being stored in wikis.",

            "text": "Over the recent years of the NAR Database Issue, there has been an increasing trend of articles being submitted where the database makes substantial use of a wiki. A wiki is a web-based tool for the curation and editing of a set of web pages. So, why have wikis become so popular? This trend is not specific to biological databases and the popularity of wikis stems from their simplicity and availability. A wiki provides a simple framework for capturing and sharing of data, generated by any user with a web browser and the appropriate permissions to edit the wiki content. Indeed, Ward Cunningham, developer of the first wiki software, described it as being 'the simplest online database that could possibly work' (see http://en .wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiki&oldid=457195 237). The most famous wiki on the web today is Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia. Wikipedia currently contains over 3.7 million pages of content, most of which can be edited by anyone. A large proportion of search engine queries return a Wikipedia article as one of the top hits. Consequently, most users of the web have come across a wiki in some shape or form, even if they did not realise it.",

            "text": "So, how do wikis relate to biological databases? Traditionally, these databases have employed small teams of expert curators, typically based at one (or maybe a few sites), to write the scientific content regarding the entries in the database. However, with the advent of wikis, the curation burden can be distributed to many more people, unrestricted by geographical location, or simply 'crowdsourced'. Moreover, wikis allows the scientists who are experts on a given topic to be engaged and to share their knowledge, rather than a biological curator having to generate content based on published literature. The openness of wikis seems odd to many scientists who are used to the peer-review model used for publications. Some scientists may assume, incorrectly, that because anyone can edit a wiki at any time, the content must be flawed, especially if they do not know who that user is.",

One of the main reasons that we came to this decision is because we believed that the openness and profile of Wikipedia embraces the highest number of potential editors. As there is no need to log-in, users can more readily edit the text, even for simple typographical corrections. There is then instant user gratification of seeing the change appear in the article. Furthermore, this approach takes advantage of 'hot topics' as they suddenly spike in public interest. Huss et al. (1) elegantly showed the correlated trend between hot topics in the news (as measured by Google searches) and the number of edits in Wikipedia in relation to the GeneWiki project. We have observed similar trends between the release of prominent papers and the number of edits to pages pertaining to those articles.",

            "text": "However, the open nature is also a potential drawback of using Wikipedia, as anyone can freely edit the content, in any way they see fit. Articles in Wikipedia have little provenance on each editor, and the lack of editing restrictions increases the likelihood that content will be inappropriately edited. Inappropriate editing falls into two broad categories, (i) blatant, malicious defacing of the content or addition of spam links and advertising; and (ii) the more subtle errors introduced, either intentionally or due to mis-understanding, resulting in misleading content. The former are obvious to someone reading the content and may cause offence. This sort of editing is a common problem for high profile wikis, such as Wikipedia. However, due to the large community of editors and the use of bots (programs that automatically edit pages) most vandalism of this nature is promptly reverted. It is the second type that is more worrying to a scientist. For example, on 3 June 2007, an anonymous Wikipedian (a user who has not logged in) modified the article on the regulatory RNA 'Riboswitches' to include a reference to an episode of the cartoon 'The Simpsons' that featured Ribwiches. It was not until 17 June 2007 that this was removed. It is unclear whether this was done maliciously, or whether it was caused by a confusion between Ribwiches and Riboswitches. Overall, inappropriate editing is rare for pages related to biology and occurs at very low rates. Since Rfam started to use Wikipedia to manage the textual annotation of RNA families in 2007, 1% of all edits have been reverted, by the Rfam curators or the greater Wikipedia community, suggesting that they may be vandalism (2). Similar numbers are presented for the GeneWiki project (3), with these authors estimating that vandalism is observed less than one page view in every 3000, a rate much lower than other articles in Wikipedia.",

While this undoubtedly helps ensure the validity of the content, there is an 'energy barrier' to overcome. Any new user must first obtain a username and password and this initial, albeit small, energy barrier will deter many casual browsers who might only want to make a small change. This undoubtedly restricts the user base, probably to those who have a vested interest in the database-this may be the desired effect.

The GeneWiki project is completely contained within Wikipedia as a portal, which acts like a homepage to the project-there is no standalone database. Each gene annotated by the project corresponds to a full article. But, full articles are not the only way to contribute to Wikipedia and expose biological databases. For example, the 'infoboxes' found on the right side on many Wikipedia pages provide a more structured way of adding data. The PDB database of protein structures (8) has a large number of links from infoboxes in Wikipedia. So, although it would not make sense to have a Wikipedia article about any particular protein crystal structure, the information is very relevant to readers of articles about biological molecules. Biological databases such as UniProtKB (9) are increasingly adding links to Wikipedia articles because the information is recognized as valuable. Pfam and Rfam adopt a model where having identified relevant articles in Wikipedia, we not only link to them, but we also import the articles back into our web pages. This is made possible by the open license used by Wikipedia. If a user wishes to change the annotation that Pfam or Rfam displays then they only need to go to Wikipedia to edit that article.",

Keep in mind that your main focus should be improving Wikipedia and not promoting your sphere of influence or getting more people to view your product. It is worth starting by editing some articles to get an idea of how Wikipedia works, as well as building up a history of trusted edits.

Where annotations do exist, the use of wikis can help to improve the annotation and keep it relevant. But, wikis are extremely simple and are unlikely to replace the complex relational organisation of many biological databases. Furthermore, when using Wikipedia, the database that uses a particular article has no control over future revisions even though they may have created it. We have already mentioned editing, but there is a more substantial control issue. An article, if the Wikipedia community considers it appropriate, can be deleted or merged into another article. Although page-redirects are maintained, the article may be substantially different to the original article that was cited. In our experience, the deleting or merging of entries is a rare event and tends to improve content for articles used by Pfam or Rfam.

Adopting a wiki means that a particular resource is no longer a closed, static resource (between public data releases) that cannot be improved by its users.

Assuming they work on the subject area, wiki articles provide them an opportunity to showcase their work in context of the field at the very least. Curation of biological data must be crowdsourced if there is any chance to comprehensively annotate the vast datasets that are being generated and the scientific community should feel responsible. Hopefully this article has provoked thoughts as to how a wiki, especially Wikipedia, may work for a resource that you are responsible for or use.
