            "text": "To evaluate the current use of Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool (AUSDRISK) as a screening tool to identify individuals at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes for entry into lifestyle modification programs. Research Design and Methods: AUSDRISK scores were calculated from participants aged 40-74 years in the Greater Green Triangle Risk Factor Study, a crosssectional population survey in 3 regions of Southwest Victoria, Australia, 2004-2006. Biomedical profiles of AUSDRISK risk categories were determined along with estimates of the Victorian population included at various cutoff scores. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and receiver operating characteristics were calculated for AUSDRISK in determining fasting plasma glucose (FPG) \u22656.1 mmol/L. Results: Increasing AUSDRISK scores were associated with an increase in weight, body mass index, FPG, and metabolic syndrome. Increasing the minimum cutoff score also increased the proportion of individuals who were obese and centrally obese, had impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and metabolic syndrome. An AUSDRISK score of \u226512 was estimated to include 39.5% of the Victorian population aged 40-74 (916 000), while a score of \u226520 would include only 5.2% of the same population (120 000). At AUSDRISK\u226520, the PPV for detecting FPG\u22656.1 mmol/L was 28.4%. Conclusions: AUSDRISK is powered to predict those with IFG and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, but its effectiveness as the sole determinant for entry into a lifestyle modification program is questionable given the large proportion of the population screened-in using the current minimum cutoff of \u226512. AUSDRISK should be used in conjunction with oral glucose tolerance testing, fasting glucose, or glycated hemoglobin to identify those individuals at highest risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, who should be the primary targets for lifestyle modification.",

Its scoring includes questions based on age, sex, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, history of abnormal glucose metabolism, smoking status, current hypertensive treatment, physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and waist circumference. The Federal DPP was discontinued in 2011 due to poor recruitment and other implementation problems. 11 The Victorian Life! program is a statewide DPP established by Diabetes Australia-Victoria in 2007. 12 AUSDRISK was chosen as the screening tool for Life!, with an entry score of \u226515 initially selected, but low recruitment rates led to a decision to lower the entry score to \u226512. 13 The Australian experience with AUSDRISK will be relevant to other countries wanting to develop a national instrument for screening.",

Although 2 h postglucose load data was not collected in this study, with the prevalence of IGT or IFG previously estimated at 16.4%, 23 the expected PPV for detecting IGT or IFG would be slightly greater than that for IFG alone. These results demonstrate that a diabetes risk assessment tool alone cannot be used to determine glucose metabolism status, and additional testing with OGTT, fasting glucose, or HbA1c is required for those who are identified to be at elevated risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes, as suggested by international guidelines. 15 16 Previous research has also demonstrated that this two-stage screening strategy is a more cost-effective method to identify individuals with undiagnosed diabetes, IFG and IGT than laboratory testing alone. 25 Even though clinicians may opt to proceed directly to laboratory testing, setting an appropriate and cost-effective cut-off score for entry to lifestyle modification programs is important, given that Life! has seen a significant proportion of individuals recruited through a variety of methods not involving physicians or other health professionals. 12 Early involvement of family physicians represents an important opportunity to identify additional comorbidities and chronic disease risk factors. Our results demonstrate that a significant proportion of individuals at high risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes also have key cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and MetS (table 3). Previous research has demonstrated the existence of treatment gaps in treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia among those participating in lifestyle modification programs. 26  Therefore, in addition to lifestyle modification, addressing these risk factors is essential to reducing future disease burden, as cardiovascular disease contributes disproportionately to the morbidity as a result of diabetes. 27 The baseline risk of diabetes among participants in lifestyle modification programs has important implications for the cost-effectiveness. Those at highest risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes represent the greatest potential for absolute reduction of incident cases of type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of 30 studies found that annual rate of progression to diabetes was 10-15% in those with IGT and IFG, 4.4-6.4% in those with isolated IGT, and 6.1-9.2% in those with isolated IFG. 6 These values are similar to the estimated annual rate of progression to type 2 diabetes for those scoring AUSDRISK\u226520 (7.8%).

Further study is warranted on the performance of AUSDRISK in the detection of IGT, elevated HbA1c, and undiagnosed diabetes where OGTT and HbA1c data are available from an Australian population. This research would complement our current study to identify a suitable AUSDRISK cut-off score for entry into Life! or any subsequent national DPP. Analysis of AUSDRISK performance in relation to detecting elevated HbA1c levels is particularly significant given the future transition away from performing OGTT and towards HbA1c and FPG testing. Data in the GGT RFS was collected in Southwest Victoria from 2004 to 2006. There were no systematic differences in the prevalence of IFG, MetS, and obesity among age and gender groups to those reported in the Victorian Health Monitor, a cross-sectional population health measurement survey collected between May 2009 and April 2010. 34 This suggests our sample for the purpose of these analyses remains a satisfactory indicator of population health characteristics in Victoria.",

Moreover, lifestyle modification programs represent one part of a targeted approach to reducing the burden of type 2 diabetes, that ideally should be accompanied by a range of population-level approaches to diabetogenic environments. 35 36 Where lifestyle medication programs are not available, screening individuals for risk of developing type 2 diabetes remains warranted, provided that simple lifestyle advice is provided and appropriate follow-up testing for those at high risk is offered, where appropriate.",

Relying on AUSDRISK at a relatively low cut-off, while recruiting large numbers of people, hinders the long-term effectiveness of the program. A multifaceted approach is required. Initial screening with AUSDRISK, followed by OGTT, fasting glucose, or HbA1c for those at high risk to detect IFG, IGT, and undiagnosed diabetes is needed. Those with IFG and IGT should be invited into Life!, while those at high risk but with normal glucose metabolism should be offered lifestyle information and rescreened in the following 3 years. To reliably establish and justify these thresholds, economic modeling is required to determine the most effective strategy.",
