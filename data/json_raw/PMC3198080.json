The retina was investigated for glial dysfunction, microglial activation, and neuronal DNA damage. The vasculature was dual stained with isolectin and collagen IV. Retinal cytokine expression was quantified using real-time RT-PCR. In parallel, oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) was used to evaluate the effects of pHBSP on retinal ischemia and neovascularization (1-30 mg/kg pHBSP or control peptide).",

EPO is highly expressed in many organs (2), and its upregulation can prevent apoptosis and associated inflammation (3). Preclinical studies demonstrate that exogenous recombinant EPO can prevent ischemia-related damage in the brain (4) and heart (5).",

Blockade of EPO expression using interference RNA (16) or antagonism of EPO-R (17) can effectively prevent neovascularization, and this has raised concerns that using EPO in diabetic patients could serve to accelerate proliferative retinopathy. This assertion has been countered by recent studies that show some forms of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent could prevent lesions associated with early stage diabetic retinopathy (18,19) and reverse retinal ischemia (20) in rodent models.

Classically, EPO binds to the homodimeric EPO-R, with high affinity on cells within the bone marrow, and controls erythrogenesis. In other tissues, a heterodimer of EPO-R and the b-common receptor can form similarly to receptors for other type I cytokines (21). This so-called tissue-protective receptor (TPR) is primarily expressed only during metabolic stress and tissue injury, and since it binds with lower affinity than to the EPO-R dimer, it responds only to local rather than circulating EPO (22). The nature of the TPR has been exploited by recent studies that demonstrate a helix B-surface peptide (pHBSP) mimics the three-dimensional structure of EPO. This does not bind to the EPO-R dimer and is nonerythrogenic (23) but is tissue protective (24).",

TUNEL-positive cells, indicating DNA strand breaks, were apparent in the GCL, INL, and ONL. Treatment with pHBSP decreased TUNEL positivity in the GCL by 49% when compared with diabetic controls (P , 0.01) (Fig. 3B). In terms of overall diabetes-related TUNEL positivity in the retina, pHBSP provided significant protection when compared with diabetic with scrambled peptide (P , 0.005) (Fig. 3C). Caspase-3-positive cells were observed in the INL mainly, but there were no differences observed between the groups ( Supplementary Fig. 2). And 8-OHdG-positive cells were found only in the diabetic retinae on the border of the ONL both in those that received the scrambled peptide and to a lesser extent in those that received the active pHBSP ( Supplementary Fig. 3). pHBSP regulates microglial activation and cytokine expression in the diabetic retina. As depicted in retinal sections, diabetes was associated with an increase in CD11b-positive microglia in the neuropile, especially within the IPL (P , 0.05) ( Fig. 4A and B). There was also a significant shift in phenotype toward activated, amoeboid cells ( Fig. 4C-F). pHBSP had no influence on overall microglia numbers, but this treatment significantly increased the proportion of cells with a dendritic phenotype and reduced amoeboid cells when compared with diabetic rats treated with the scrambled pHBSP (P , 0.05) ( Fig. 4A  and B). Lectin-stained microglia also showed that diabetes was associated with an increase in microglia compared with the controls in the inner plexus in the central (P , 0.01) and peripheral retina (P , 0.05) ( Supplementary  Fig. 4).",

By contrast, mRNAs for the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-6 were significantly elevated in diabetic retina (P , 0.001), and pHBSP prevented this increase and restored expression to normal levels in both cases (Fig. 5B  and C). STZ-induced diabetes caused a reduction in IL-1b levels when compared with control tissue treated with scrambled peptide (P , 0.001). Treatment with pHBSP caused a reduction in IL-1b levels both in nondiabetic tissue and diabetic tissue (P , 0.001) (Fig. 5D). pHBSP protects retinal capillaries during diabetes. As diabetes progresses, the death of retinal pericytes and endothelium results in acellular capillary formation, a lesion that takes ;5-6 months to become obvious in diabetic rats (30). While various approaches have been used to visualize acellular capillaries, we used the fact that such naked basement membrane tubes remain positive for collagen IV and negative for isolectin and can be quantified using confocal microscopy (Fig. 6A). The diabetic retina contained approximately fourfold increased numbers of acellular capillaries when compared with nondiabetic control retina (P , 0.05) ( Fig. 6A and B). pHBSP treatment for 1 month, after 6 previous months of diabetes, significantly reduced acellular capillaries in the retina, and there were no differences between these treated patients with diabetes in comparison with nondiabetic control groups (Fig. 6B). pHBSP does not exacerbate ischemia-induced neovascularization. As determined in the murine OIR model, pHBSP did not increase the percentage of reticulocytes in peripheral blood over an acute time frame (Supplementary Fig. 5). A dose of 1 mg/kg of pHBSP resulted in a decrease in the ischemic region of the retina. The higher doses of the peptide returned the ischemic region to normal ( Fig. 7A). Consistent with the well-characterized OIR response, hyperoxia induced a temporal pattern of central retina vascular insufficiency upon return to room air at P12, which led to a reproducible preretinal neovascularization observable on flat mounts (Fig. 7B). Over a dose response range, pHBSP administered from P12 to P16 inclusive demonstrated no significant increase in ischemia-driven preretinal neovascularization (Fig. 7B-D).",

When administered for 1 month after 6 previous months of diabetes, pHBSP can prevent several important lesions of diabetic retinopathy. These include GFAP upregulation in the M\u00fcller glia, neuronal death, retinal inflammatory responses, and capillary degeneration. The current investigation builds on a previous study using a full-length pHBSP, which demonstrates prevention of BRB dysfunction during diabetes (22), and adds compelling evidence that elements of EPO-R signaling can be harnessed for treating diabetic retinopathy. Many previous studies have used an array of therapeutic approaches and shown effective protection against various pathological end points during diabetic retinopathy. However, these treatments were commenced at establishment of experimental diabetes, and very few studies have evaluated efficacy once diabetes is well advanced. It is significant that the current investigation provides evidence that an intervention strategy, evoking EPO-mediated tissue protection in the diabetic retina, has significant benefits. Such a regimen has considerable clinical relevance since many diabetic patients have established retinopathy at diagnosis.",

A typical dose for treatment of anemia in patients is ;100 IU/kg, although to achieve tissue protection, much larger doses are needed (;500 IU/kg). While EPO can sometimes be delivered directly to a damaged tissue, this therapy can result in unwanted elevations in hematocrit with associated vascular thrombosis and hypertension (31). Although delivered systemically in both models, pHBSP induced no changes in reticulocytes or hematocrit in the mouse or rat, respectively, despite the latter being delivered over a 28-day period. Such a delivery method appears valid since EPO crosses the BRB (14) and, therefore, it is likely that this 11aa peptide also crosses the retinal vascular endothelium. As demonstrated, this EPO analog appears to possess the tissue-protective advantages of EPO without the disadvantages.",

While EPO-mediated angiogenesis can significantly improve wound repair (32), postinfarction myocardial vascular remodeling (33), and reperfusion of cerebral ischemia (34), such angiogenic responses in the context of retinopathy raise significant concerns. This is reinforced by reports that EPO levels are raised in the vitreous of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (17). However, several experimental studies show that early administration of EPO can protect neurons, prevent vessel degeneration, and subsequently suppress the stimulus for hypoxia-induced neovascularization (15) by evoking beneficial intraretinal angiogenesis (20). Nevertheless, the disease phase at which EPO is introduced may alter the outcome, and EPO treatment-while the retina is experiencing hypoxia-may enhance pathological, preretinal neovascularization (15). Therefore, a major finding of the current study is that pHBSP not only prevents early stage pathology but also fails to evoke preretinal neovascularization and, thus, carries considerably less risk than recombinant EPO if used in diabetic patients.",

Microglia in particular are the resident immune cells of the retina, and their activation, combined with infiltration of circulating monocytes into the neuropile, could play an important regulatory role in diabetic retinopathy through cytokine expression and related cell responses (38). It is interesting that pHBSP reduced constitutive expression levels of some cytokines in normal retina, for example, IL-1b. The reason for this is unclear but may be related to slightly elevated levels in older rats and the potential for pHBSP to interfere with proinflammatory signaling. In brain ischemia, microglial responses have been shown to be suppressed by EPO-related therapy (39), and there may be similar dampening of microglial activation, and associated proinflammatory cytokine expression is suppressed by pHBSP in diabetic retinopathy.",

There are likely to be comparable benefits for the diabetic retina since progressive retinal neuronal and M\u00fcller cell dysfunction, DNA damage, and cell death have been previously demonstrated (40), although in rats this may take .4 months to become evident (25). In the current study, the TUNEL-positive cells in the retina are likely to represent DNA damage in a range of neurons and glia but not necessarily apoptotic death. This argument is strengthened by the caspase-3 data in this study. The 8-OHdG staining observed in the ONL of the diabetic retina suggests that there is extensive DNA damage, which is also indicated by TUNEL. While EPO can inhibit neural cell apoptosis (14), it can also upregulate enzymes that scavenge oxygen radicals during brain ischemia (41) and protect against DNA damage (42). Wang et al. (18) have recently reported EPO-mediated protection against oxidative damage in the diabetic retina long before ischemia is present, and this may account for the observed reduction in DNA damage evoked by pHBSP treatment. In the current study, pHBSP (1 mg/kg) reduced retinal ischemia in the murine model, although the response was more apparent at the lower concentration. This may reflect commonly observed cytokine responses that are likely related to receptor dynamics and are often characterized by a U-shaped dose response curve (hormesis).",

While pHBSP treatment could significantly modulate all these pathways, it is perhaps surprising that 1 month of treatment with pHBSP after 6 previous months of diabetes FIG. 6. pHBSP prevents retinal capillary degeneration during diabetes. The retinal vasculature was visualized in flat mounts using concomitant labeling of endothelium (isolectin) and basement membrane (collagen IV).

(A high-quality digital representation of this figure is available in the online issue.) could have such a marked effect on reversal of acellular vessels. Death of retinal capillary component cells during diabetes is not necessarily linear, and the progressive nature of many pathogenic pathways indicates that endotheliopathy and pericyte death are the result of accumulative abnormalities in the early stages of diabetes. Indeed, acellular capillaries are not usually evident until at least 4-5 months of hyperglycemia (44). Although not evaluated in the current investigation, it should also be considered that activation of the EPO-Rs could mobilize vasoreparative endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into the circulating blood to target areas of hypoxia. The mechanism(s) by which EPCs mobilize and home to areas of ischemia are complex but involve stimulatory factors such as EPO (45) and VEGF (46). Diabetes causes EPC dysfunction, and this is associated with impaired vascular repair in diabetic retinopathy (47); it is possible that systemic delivery of pHBSP in diabetic rats could have enhanced EPC mobilization and thereby improved reparative function in a comparable manner to that described for EPO (48). This requires further study.",
