Professionals perceived no increase in the volume of patient queries or clinical consultations as a result of Record Access; indeed some believed that these had decreased. Most clinicians and patients believed that the service had improved mutual trust, communication, patients' health knowledge and health behaviour. Inhibiting factors included concerns about security, liability and resource requirements. Non-adoption was most frequently attributed to competing priorities, rather than negative beliefs about the service."

Central to the 'eHealth' vision espoused by many governments is the promise of networked ICT (internet and mobile) to help engage citizens as partners in healthcare, chiefly through increasing the accessibility of relevant information and services. 1 This reflects a growing emphasis, in many Western nations, on patient-centred healthcare models and complements wider citizen-centric policy initiatives around public engagement, freedom of information and civic transparency.",

            "text": "Electronic Health Records (EHR) represent the central pillar of eHealth strategies worldwide, since they offer the capacity to support patient care, quality improvement, population health surveillance and research. 2 Until recently the topics of EHR and 'Consumer Health Informatics' tended to be considered separately; discussions of the former being mainly centred on healthcare institutions. Across North America and Europe there has been a gradual realization of the synergies between these two areas, manifested in the growing attention that is being paid to Personal Health Records (PHR) in both the scientific and policy literatures. The PHR is a complex construct and many have bemoaned the lack of consensus on its precise definition. 3 The central feature is a patient-accessible Electronic Health Record, although models vary in the source and controller of the information (healthcare provider or patient; single or multiple providers), the medium (e.g. web, kiosk, USB) and the additional functionalities associated with the software (e.g. education, prescription reordering, provider messaging, decision support). 4,5 This report is concerned with one particular aspect of the PHR concept, namely online access by patients to provider-generated information that is specific to their health history and current conditions, and held in the computer systems of primary healthcare centres. We refer to this as Record Access, in line with the language adopted in recent guidelines from the Royal College of General Practitioners, 6 although similar applications have also been characterised as 'tethered Personal Health Records'. 7 The idea of patients accessing their own health records is not a new one. 8 However, the accessibility afforded by the Internet, and the capacity of emerging PHR to integrate personal health applications with provider-owned record systems, creates interesting new challenges and research questions.",

Moreover the majority had shared their record with a partner or family member, indicating that patients and clinicians may have rather different views of the costs and benefits of data transparency, an observation also made in the recent evaluation of the Summary Care Record in England. 21 Despite some concerns about operational resourcing, the relative ease with which record access appears to have been integrated into work practices and its lack of impact (or its positive impact) on administrative time and clinical workflow bode well for more widespread use. It is noteworthy that practices which had yet to implement the service remained positive about it and intended to do so in the future.",

Our survey also gives early signals to the potential efficiency gains that may come from record access once it has become more widely embedded. For example, some clinicians felt that it had reduced the frequency and length of consultations, and some patients reported having used it to help make more effective use of hospital appointments."

Those agreeing to participate and then proceeding to implement the service and complete our survey may conceivably be more patient-centred, more technologically literate or have more patients with long term illnesses, than the others. Little is known about how the practices recruited patients to complete the questionnaire, and their decisions may have been influenced by knowledge of individuals' health characteristics or involvement in relevant groups. In this respect the high proportion of over 40s with long-term conditions is noteworthy. Nevertheless, such factors may, paradoxically, increase the ecological validity of this study, since these technologies are most likely to be adopted by those for whom the potential benefits are greatest and who are most interested. 22 Meaning of the study: possible mechanisms and implications for clinicians or policymakers Mindful of these caveats, our results indicate that online record access offers great potential to address patient and citizen-centred agendas in the UK.",

The UK primary care sector is in an excellent position to integrate these services at relatively low cost, given the universal use of electronic health record systems, state-mandated interoperability requirements and competition between suppliers for the lucrative general practice systems market, in which patient-facing services are likely to offer an advantage.",
