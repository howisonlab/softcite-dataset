Professionals perceived no increase in the volume of patient queries or clinical consultations as a result of Record Access; indeed some believed that these had decreased. Most clinicians and patients believed that the service had improved mutual trust, communication, patients' health knowledge and health behaviour. Inhibiting factors included concerns about security, liability and resource requirements. Non-adoption was most frequently attributed to competing priorities, rather than negative beliefs about the service.",

Across North America and Europe there has been a gradual realization of the synergies between these two areas, manifested in the growing attention that is being paid to Personal Health Records (PHR) in both the scientific and policy literatures. The PHR is a complex construct and many have bemoaned the lack of consensus on its precise definition. 3 The central feature is a patient-accessible Electronic Health Record, although models vary in the source and controller of the information (healthcare provider or patient; single or multiple providers), the medium (e.g. web, kiosk, USB) and the additional functionalities associated with the software (e.g. education, prescription reordering, provider messaging, decision support). 4,5 This report is concerned with one particular aspect of the PHR concept, namely online access by patients to provider-generated information that is specific to their health history and current conditions, and held in the computer systems of primary healthcare centres. We refer to this as Record Access, in line with the language adopted in recent guidelines from the Royal College of General Practitioners, 6 although similar applications have also been characterised as 'tethered Personal Health Records'. 7 The idea of patients accessing their own health records is not a new one. 8 However, the accessibility afforded by the Internet, and the capacity of emerging PHR to integrate personal health applications with provider-owned record systems, creates interesting new challenges and research questions.",

None expressed concerns about litigation, citing confidence in the information held in their systems, although there was some uncertainty about their position if record access were to reveal third-party information.

Moreover the majority had shared their record with a partner or family member, indicating that patients and clinicians may have rather different views of the costs and benefits of data transparency, an observation also made in the recent evaluation of the Summary Care Record in England. 21 Despite some concerns about operational resourcing, the relative ease with which record access appears to have been integrated into work practices and its lack of impact (or its positive impact) on administrative time and clinical workflow bode well for more widespread use. It is noteworthy that practices which had yet to implement the service remained positive about it and intended to do so in the future.",

In this respect the high proportion of over 40s with long-term conditions is noteworthy.
