However, most post-processing methods of this type of data have been focused on detection of protein complexes and not its subcomplexes. Here, we review the results of some existing methods that may allow subcomplex detection and propose alternative methods in order to detect subcomplexes from AP-MS data. We assessed and drew comparisons between the use of overlapping clustering methods, methods based in the core-attachment model and our own prediction strategy (TRIBAL). The hypothesis behind TRIBAL is that subcomplex-building information may be concealed in the multiple edges generated by an interaction repeated in different contexts in raw data. The CACHET method offered the best results when the evaluation of the predicted subcomplexes was carried out using both the hypergeometric and geometric scores. TRIBAL offered the best performance when using a strict meet-min score.",

Traditionally, it has been argued that these methods produce high levels of noise 1 although this claim has been contested 2 . Either way, complex detection from affinity-purification (AP) high-throughput (HT) data is not a straightforward process and to convert such data to a list of complexes demands the application of a series of post-processing steps that are still an open field of research 3 .",

Such a list is subject to false positives and false negatives (see Supplementary file, section 1, for a detailed review) and it is traditionally corrected by scoring the interactions according to different methods that measure the propensity of two proteins to interact given the background of interactions. Reliable interactions are integrated into a network which is then clustered to generate protein complexes 3,4 . These methods became very relevant as it was noticed that the differences between the conclusions of the first two main comprehensive maps of the yeast complexome were mainly a result of the pre-processing methods they employed 3,5 .",

The socio-affinity index (SA) scored the interaction between proteins i and j by including terms for how often i retrieves j and a term for how often pairs of proteins are seen together as preys. These were calculated as the log-odds of the number of times the proteins were observed together relative to what would be expected from their frequency in the data set 6 . Hart et al. postulated a scoring system based on the use of a hypergeometric distribution relative to a matrix model of interactions 7 . The Purification Enrichment score (PE) pointed out the limitants of the SA method, such as to include only positive evidence and not the inability of a protein to be identified by another, and as being suitable mainly for cases where all proteins were both baits and preys. Alternatively, the authors used a na\u00efve Bayes classifier, which estimates the probability of one hypothesis (interaction is reliable) relative to the probability of a second hypothesis (interaction is not reliable). The score was the log-ratio of these probabilities, computed using Bayes' theorem 5 . Finally, the Dice score was suggested as a simple alternative that focuses on comparing the copurification patterns of two proteins across all different purification experiments; this is, constructing a pulldown matrix of proteins versus experiments and using a Dice index to compare each pair of protein profiles 4 . Additional scoring systems have been proposed in recent years 8,9 .",

            "text": "Protein subcomplex detection is an interesting special case of the more general complex prediction problem. A subcomplex can be defined as a functional (or predicted) complex which is a subset of a larger functional (or predicted) complex. In other words, the protein subunits of the subcomplex must be a subset of the protein subunits of the larger complex. Subcomplexes have been approached in different ways in the literature. One line of work depict them as clusters lying inside bigger network clusters, this is, the most connected region inside a bigger connected region, which is found using clustering strategies tailored for that purpose 10 . Other authors pay attention to the ''cores'' that repeat in several complexes and the ''attachments'' that make them different to each other 6 . Here the core of a core-attachment structure could be considered as a subcomplex. A similar approach focuses on studying multi-cluster and monocluster proteins after applying overlapping clustering algorithms to protein interaction networks 11 . Together with all these approaches, the ''subcomplex'' term can also be used to strictly define a biologically-relevant subcomplex, i.e., the subcomplexes that have been experimentally found to be functional and independent from the complex that contain them. Examples of subcomplexes are the TFIIK complex (related to the TFIIH complex), ADA-GCN5 complex (with SAGA complex), pre-replication complex (with replication complex) and ribonuclease MRP (with ribonuclease P). We will reserve the name ''subcomplex'' for these biologically meaningful macromolecular structures, while we will refer to ''subcomplex predictions'' to denote specific subcomplex representations.",

For example, the iRefIndex, which is a consolidation of 13 of the most popular protein interaction databases, contains 8145 cases of complex-subcomplex pairs 12 . But, at the same time, some of the algorithms used in the AP complex prediction pipeline, such as MCL, are non-overlapping clustering algorithms, making impossible any subcomplex detection. New methods that face the subcomplex detection problem have recently appeared but they need to be assessed and compared. The first line of research would be the incorporation of overlapping clustering algorithms to the complex detection pipeline. The second type of methods is based on the core-attachment model.

Most have been proposed following the assumption that complexes can be reconstructed from highly densely connected regions in the network 13 : RNSC and MCL are some important examples 14 . A review of twelve of these algorithms 15 claim that the best prediction method is ''Infomap'', followed by ''Fast modularity'', and ''Potts model approach''. However, it has also been argued that densely connected regions do not reflect functional units; hence, alternative ways to look at the complex prediction problem have been proposed 13,16,17 . In addition, complex prediction algorithms have also evolved from algorithms that generate non-intersecting or non-overlapping clusters to algorithms that take into account the fact that protein complexes share subunits with other complexes, i.e., overlapping community detection algorithms.

Two recent papers, 22 and 23 , present a review of current clustering methods applied to protein complex identification. A group of methods, including CORE 24 , COACH 25 and CACHET 26 , deserve a special mention for explicitly incorporating the above-mentioned ''coreattachment'' model (other methods include: Markov random fields 27 and CODEC 28 ).",

We will evaluate the use of some recent methods that are able to detect ''nested communities'' or ''hierarchies'', in order to prove whether or not these nested communities can detect biologically meaningful subcomplexes, while we introduce a new method to identify subcomplexes from AP data. We start from the premise that most of the previous procedures remove the multi-edge nature of pull-down data in an interaction network (i.e., bait-prey co-occurrences), which is the network signature of a subcomplex. For example, some scoring methods reduce all co-appearances of a bait and a prey protein to one single weighted interaction, whereas some clustering methods explicitly remove any subcomplex candidates. An example of this is the Leu4-Leu9 interaction from Gavin's dataset 6 : This interaction does not end up in any complexes when using the PE score, whilst the SA scores produce three complexes and the Dice score produces 2 complexes containing Leu4, Leu9 and a few more subunits. A Leu4-Leu9 complex does not appear in the results with any scoring method and, in fact, Leu4 and Leu9 are the subunits of the alpha-isopropylmalate synthase. This demonstrates how a highly scored copurification, which happens to be a complex, may get filtered out by the clustering method. Here we introduce TRIBAL (TRIad-Based ALgorithm), a novel method to identify subcomplexes from AP data that preserves and exploits this co-occurrence information.",

This range was selected due to the size of the resulting PIN: Below 0.001, the size of the PINs does not increase, whereas, after 0.2, PINs then contain a small amount of edges (less than 1000).

There are several computational methods to do that, and two of the most popular are the F-measure and the area under the ROC curve. In the following tables, we show the first one.

These assumptions can be partially validated through the performances of the methods. The results show that CACHET gives the best results in terms of similarity (geometric or hypergeometric indexes) to the MIPS reference set (this is mainly due to its better recall), while TRIBAL offers the best precision in terms of similarity and the best performance in terms of containment metrics (meet-min index).

Besides problems due to coverage, false positives and inconsistencies regarding mutual pull-down (see Supplementary File), most traditional methods are not able to detect subcomplexes due to decisions made in the scoring and clustering steps. Based on this knowledge, we have identified the best strategies to detect subcomplexes, including the development of TRIBAL, a simple strategy that improves the precision of subcomplex prediction compared to previous methods. These strategies are the initial attempts to specifically address the subcomplex detection problem in co-purification data. This paper suggests that overlapping clustering methods fail to detect subcomplexes from AP data while the core-attachment model used by CACHET and similar software seems to be the best option to this date. However, it also suggests that alternatives such as the co-purification matrix introduced by TRIBAL deserve more attention, as they show potential thanks to a high precision, especially when we evaluate the meet-min index, i.e., subcomplexes absolutely contained by larger complexes. Finally, research in subcomplex identification demands the generation of curated gold standards for subcomplexes, which will be an important step to achieve a better validation of predictions.",
