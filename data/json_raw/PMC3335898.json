            "text": "Background: Opium use in diabetic populations is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study was designed to investigate the relationship between opium use and severity of depression in Iranian diabetic patients. Methods: In this case-control study, 642 type 2 diabetic patients were recruited from those presenting at two outpatient clinics at the Akhavan Hospital in Kashan, Iran; of them, 600 diabetic patients were included in the study and divided into two groups: opium-abusers (150 patients) and non-opium-abusers (450 patients). Clinical and demographic information was obtained through a detailed questionnaire. Depression symptomalogy and severity were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and a corresponding diagnosis was made based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV, Text Revision, 2000 (DSM-IV TR) criteria. Results: The mean depression score was higher in the opium abuse group than in the non-abuser group (29.27\u00b11.44 vs. 18.29\u00b1 1.31, P<0.001). In general, a significant association was found between opium abuse and depression among patients (odds ratio [OR], 4.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.87 to 7.44; P=0.001). No significant relationship was found between dysthymia and opium abuse (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.18 to 1.192; P=0.155), while MDD was significantly higher in the opium abuser group (OR, 7.32; 95% CI, 5.20 to 12.01; P<0.001). Conclusion: Depression is more frequent in opium-dependent diabetic patients, and its severity is also greater. Given these findings, opium-dependent diabetic patients should be advised about the increased risks of depression and related comorbidities."

            "text": "Opium has traditionally been consumed in Iran as a treat-ment for pain, diarrhea, insomnia, and premature ejaculation. It is also used for enjoyment and elimination of tension [5,6]. Some Iranian patients consume opium for their diabetes, although the reasons and prevalence are not clear. The pain reduction effects of opium and a lack of adequate knowledge may explain their opium usage to some extent, but research is needed to gain a better understanding. However, it is known that opium abuse among diabetics is associated with an increased risk of severe depression [7]. Overall, about 90% of opioid-dependent patients are recognized to have a psychiatric disorder, which most typically include depression [8], antisocial character, anxiety [9], and memory and psychosomatic disorders [10,11]. Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders [12]. Initial presenting symptoms tend to include an increasingly reduced sense of self-efficacy, reduced self-care behaviors, mood swings, and in some cases increased suicidal ideation [9,13]. These symptoms, although significant in and of themselves, can also exacerbate problems for patients with diabetes [3], such as poor medical adherence, functional impairment, and high health care costs (up to 86% in primary care) [14].",

However, all opium abusers reported having regularly used opium for at least 12 months prior to admission (as indicated by the question, \"Has the client continued to use opium despite recurrent problems aggravated by the substance use within the last 12-month period?\") [15].

The reason why opium abuse appears to worsen depression severity in diabetic patients has not been clarified. Although opium use was once recommended as a treatment for diabetes mellitus [35], studies have demonstrated that opium addiction adversely affects some serum factors in diabetic patients by increasing serum glucose, decreasing high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and thus adding to metabolic derangements [36]. Further, serum glucose elevation in diabetics appears to be   [3]. Association between opium and depression or diabetes and depression has been discussed in several studies, and recent studies have found a significant association between opium abuse and depression in diabetic patients [7]. The current study also found this association to be significant, with 74.3% of opium abusing diabetic patients diagnosed with MDD, compared to 36.1% of non-abusing diabetic patients. In contrast, Shiri et al. [7] detected MDD in only 22.8% of diabetic men which was 1.7 times more than non-abuser diabetics. The reason for this considerable difference in results is not clear, but study design differences and confounders are likely contributors. In another study, Khamseh et al. [1] reported a 71.8% prevalence of MDD in all diabetic patients (abuser or non-abuser), just slightly less than the 74.3% in our study's abuser group. Their study included both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, while only type 2 diabetics were enrolled in our study. This appears to highlight the direct impact of opium consumption on diabetics' depressive symptoms compared to the effects of diabetes alone.",

Group differences were adjusted for unmatched variables, but there are many possible confounders which were not measured or presented in this study. These include other aspects of physical health, mental health, and social support which might have modified the observed association between opium addiction and depression. Similarly, other possible con-founders, such as thyroid function and folate levels, which may impact depression, were not matched between the groups. Findings could also have been enhanced by adding another control group consisting of non-diabetic opium abusers to assess the direct effects of opium abuse on depression."
