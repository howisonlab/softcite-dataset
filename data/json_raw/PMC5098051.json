However, little information currently exists regarding precooling effects in Iranian young soccer players. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of precooling (water immersion) on exhaustive performance in the heat (temperature = 32-34\u00b0C, humidity = 50%). Patients and Methods: Sixteen young male soccer players from the provincial competitive teams were divided into two equal groups and were randomly assigned to precooling (age = 16.5 \u00b1 1.1 year, height = 171.7 \u00b1 6.4 cm, BMI = 21.5 \u00b1 3.3, VO2max = 50.6 \u00b1 6.9 mL/kg/min) and non-precooling (age = 16.1 \u00b1 1.1 year, height = 170.0 \u00b1 4.7 cm, BMI = 21.3 \u00b1 3.6, VO2max = 50.6 \u00b1 6.8 mL/kg/min) groups. An exhaustive treadmill run test was conducted after warm-up (non-precooling) or warm-up + water immersion (temperature = 22-24\u00b0C). Oral temperature, plasma lactate and plasma volume were measured at the baseline (fasting state), mid test (immediately after warm up or warm-up + water immersion) and post test (immediately after exhaustive test). Mixed repeated measures analysis of variance and independent t test were used for data analyzing. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: There were no significant differences between two groups at baseline, mid test and post test regarding oral temperature and plasma lactate. The time to exhaustion was considerably higher in the precooling group compared with the non-precooling group, but the difference was not statistically significant. No significant differences were found between the two groups on measures of the baseline and mid test plasma volume, but post test plasma volume was significantly higher in the precooling group compared to the non-precooling group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: These results show that precooling effectively attenuates dehydration, but has no positive effect on exhaustion time in the hot environment.",

            "text": "The function of all organs and health status are dependent on the body water and electrolyte balance (1,2). Water facilitates biochemical reactions within cells and tissues and is critical for maintaining the blood volume (3). Body water compartments contain electrolytes, which are essential for moving fluid between extracellular and intracellular space and for producing cell membrane potentials (4). One hour of moderate physical activity produces 0.5 to 1.5 L of sweat and considerable water loss occurs during several hours of vigorous exercise in a hot environment (4), which can lead to the loss of electrolytes such as sodium (5,6). The loss of body fluid impairs thermoregulation, circulatory system and athletic performance (7,8). Soccer is the most popular sport among the Iranian high school students. Hundreds of high school students in Iran participate in soccer training programs during summer holidays which last for three months. Soccer is a combination of aerobic and anaerobic activities, leading to high rates of metabolic heat production and may cause dehydration during hot summer days (9). We are unaware of any studies about dehydration in the Iranian young soccer players, but a recent study by Da Silva et al showed that mean sweat losses were approximately 2.5 L in young soccer players during a match played in the heat (31.0 \u00b1 2.0\u00b0C) and the players replaced less than 50% of their sweat loss (10). Recent data indicated significant water deficit in young soccer players, when water or sport drinks were available, an indication of involuntary dehydration (11). It is well documented that dehydration reduces plasma volume (12) which in turn will lead to active muscles blood flow restrictions and core temperature rising, both of which compromise athletic performance and thermal regulation during physical activity un-der hot conditions (13). In general, water and electrolytes replenishment before, during and after exercise and precooling are approaches which have been used to prevent the athletic performance impairment and heat related injuries in a high ambient temperature. Water-immersion, cool water showering, the wearing of ice-cooling garments and cold air exposure are different methods of pre-cooling. Reduction of body temperature prior to a subsequent exercise bout under high temperature condition is the underlying rationale for all the methods.",

Two groups of the young soccer players performed an exhaustive treadmill run test after warm up or warm up + precooling. No significant difference was found in the exhaustion time between the precooling and non-precooling groups. In contrast to our result, previous studies had reported endurance performance improvement after precooling in hot condition. Booth et al. and Marino et al. reported endurance performance ( distance run or cycle) improvement after water immersion (15,21). Cold air exposure (as a precooling maneuver) was found to increase the work output during an exhaustive or endurance type test (21). The authors interpreted the results in light of reduced thermoregulatory strain (21), decreased reliance on anaerobic energy production (22) and attenuated plasma volume reduction (16) in precooled condition. Greater heat storage rate has been reported in precooling trail than in control trail (23), which allows greater margin for metabolic heat production. Booth et al observed deep body temperature increment immediately after precooling which significantly decreased at the commencement of the exercise (15). We found no significant change in the oral temperature immediately after precooling, and there was no significant between group difference in mid test oral temperature (Table 2). Based on these results, it can be said that the lack of significant difference in exhaus-tive performance between precooling and control trails might be due to the fact that precooling did not create any heat storage capacity prior to the exhaustive test. Ten minutes of water immersion was conducted in this study, compared with the 60 minutes in the other studies (24). It seems that the immersing duration was not high enough to create thermal gradient for heat dissipation.",

            "text": "In the present study, precooling attenuated the plasma volume decrement during exhaustive test in the heat condition. At the same time, non precooling group showed reduction in plasma volume, which lead to the significant between group differences following exhaustive test (Table  2). Given this result, it can be said that the amount of fluid loss as sweat was higher in the non-precooling than that of in the precooling. Reduced plasma volume in the nonprecooling group following exercise in hot condition, that is characterized as hypovolemia (decrease in the volume of blood plasma) (25), is in line with similar other studies which found a decrease in plasma volume (26,27). During exercise in the heat, active muscles' blood flow must be maintained at a high level to supply oxygen and substrates, On the other hand, high blood flow to the skin must also be maintained to convert heat to the body surface, but hypovolumia can restrict these tissues blood flow (28,29). It is well established that acute anemia induces increased lactate concentrations in animals during exercise (22), and there is strong evidence that the hypovolumia is responsible for the increase in heat storage and a decrease in heat loss during exercise (3). These effects can limit the exercise performance in the heat (1). Compared with the nonprecooling trail, our precooling maneuver attenuated the plasma volume reduction, but could not induce any positive effects on plasma lactate and exhaustive performance, since no significant differences were found in the post test plasma lactate and exhaustive performance between the two groups (Table 2). In an earlier study, blood lactate was decreased despite an increase in endurance performance following precooling (30). It was speculated that decreased blood lactate following precooling might in part be associated with altered muscle metabolism due to the marked reduction in tissue temperature (30). We did not find any difference in the oral temperature between two groups following precooling. Oral cavity temperature is considered as a reliable index of core temperature when the thermometer is placed into the sublingual pocket, because the sublingual pocket is close to the sublingual artery and tracks changes in core body temperature (31). In this study, oral temperatures were recorded in the sublingual pocket. Therefore, we can probably say that the similar exhaustion time in two study groups was because of the fact that cold water immersing did not affect the core body temperature to induce positive metabolic change.",

Non-precooling group showed a body water loss of about 1% of body weight (data not presented) immediately after exhaustive test. It seems that the level of dehydration was not high enough to cause an adverse effect on exhaustive performance in the non-precooling group.",
