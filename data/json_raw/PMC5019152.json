Methods Three Data Partners provided their earliest available (\"fresh\") cumulative claims data on influenza vaccination and health outcomes 3-4 times on a staggered basis during the 2013-2014 influenza season, collectively producing 10 data updates. We monitored anaphylaxis in the entire population using a cohort design and seizures in children \u22644 years of age using both a self-controlled risk interval design (primary) and a cohort design (secondary). After each data update, we conducted sequential analysis for inactivated (IIV) and live (LAIV) influenza vaccines using the Maximized Sequential Probability Ratio Test, adjusting for data-lag. Results Most of the 10 sequential analyses were conducted within 6 weeks of the last care-date in the cumulative dataset. A total of 6 682 336 doses of IIV and 782 125 doses of LAIV were captured. The primary analyses did not identify any statistical signals following IIV or LAIV. In secondary analysis, the risk of seizures was higher following concomitant IIV and PCV13 than historically after IIV in 6-to 23-month-olds (relative risk = 2.7), which requires further investigation. Conclusions The Sentinel System can implement a sequential analysis system that uses fresh data for medical product safety surveillance. Active surveillance using sequential analysis of fresh data holds promise for detecting clinically significant health risks early. Limitations of employing fresh data for surveillance include cost and the need for careful scrutiny of signals.",

            "text": "The H1N1 pandemic of 2009 created an urgent need to stand up multiple vaccine safety surveillance systems to support public health efforts to safely vaccinate the U.S. population. 1 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sponsored Vaccine Safety Datalink 2 had already pioneered the development and application of sequential analysis methods using timely data from managed care organizations, [3][4][5] and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had developed the technical and methodological capability to use weekly Medicare administrative data for safety monitoring. In conjunction with the existing VSD and CMS systems, 6,7 H1N1 vaccine safety surveillance by the FDAsponsored Post-licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) system was launched in the fall of 2009, using data from large health insurers and state immunization registries. 1,8 A major challenge was the critical need to obtain and analyze recent data on a frequent basis in order to detect safety problems in time to intervene, as influenza vaccines are typically given within a short span of time. 9 Subsequently, FDA wished to determine the feasibility of conducting timely sequential analysis for influenza vaccine safety as an integral part of the Sentinel System (formerly the Mini-Sentinel Pilot 10 ). Currently, Sentinel data are refreshed on a quarterly basis and contain relatively settled and complete data, the most recent of which are 6-9 months old. The time required for data to settle would limit the ability to inform regulatory decisions about the use of influenza vaccine in a timely manner. The goal was to access, use, and evaluate fresh data for timely influenza vaccine safety surveillance in the Sentinel population in order to develop a potentially sustainable infrastructure to apply to other FDA-regulated medical products requiring faster access to safety information.",

The cumulative numbers of cases in pre-specified risk and control intervals are compared, adjusting for unequal interval lengths. The analysis is conditioned on the individual, and only those with a seizure in either the risk or the control interval contribute to the analysis. This self-controlled design is our preferred approach for influenza vaccine safety monitoring, because it controls for all fixed potential confounders, such as sex and co-morbidities. A limitation of the method is that time-varying confounders, such as age and seasonality, may bias the findings. However, such confounding was mitigated here by the lessthan-3-week-long follow-up period (Table 1). Another limitation is that for rare outcomes, power to detect signals in a timely fashion may be low, particularly if the effect size is modest. We used current-vs.-historical comparison as a secondary method for seizures to detect any increased risk earlier than would have been possible with the SCRI method alone.",

The comparison group was IIV vaccinees (largely without concomitant PCV13) in prior seasons. No statistical signal was seen in the primary, SCRI analysis, which compared the risk between exposed and unexposed time from the same concomitant vaccinees. Although our signal investigation found that 6-to 23-month-old concomitant vaccinees had a greater risk of post-vaccination seizures compared to those receiving IIV without PCV13, this was not a self-controlled analysis and thus was subject to potential residual confounding. Moreover, the analysis was not designed to examine the effect of PCV13 vaccination by itself. The historical rates used were from prior to July 2010, which is also largely prior to any concomitant PCV13 usage. The purpose of this restriction was to exclude influenza seasons in which the risk of post-IIV seizure was elevated and to exclude most concomitant PCV13.  vaccine safety surveillance using fresh data  w. k. yih et al.  vaccine safety surveillance using fresh data  Indications have emerged of a possible increased risk of febrile seizures after IIV vaccination in young children in the U.S. in some prior seasons. 13,22,23 Given the usual annual change in influenza vaccine antigenic composition, the relevance of results from earlier seasons to our finding of 2013-2014 is unclear. PRISM did not find a statistically significant elevated risk for febrile seizures in the 2010-2011 season. 12 VSD found an increased risk of seizure after IIV in 2010-2011 13 and 2011-2012 23 (in which seasons the antigenic composition of the vaccine was the same) but not in 2012-2013 23 or 2013-2014. 24 In 2013-2014, unlike PRISM, VSD did not stratify the exposure for the 6-to 23-month-olds into IIV with and IIV without concomitant PCV13. This difference may explain the apparently different findings between the two systems that season -indeed, if we pool our 6-to 23-month-old IIV vaccinees (i.e. without regard to concomitant PCV13), the number of observed cases is 20 vs. 18.38 expected, for a RR of 1.09 (derived from Table 2, Analysis #10). (In the future, when the safety of the same vaccine is to be monitored by more than one system, it would be worthwhile to harmonize certain features of the methods, such as exposure and health outcome definitions, so as to facilitate comparison and interpretation of the results. Although a case could be made for combining data to maximize statistical power, comparing results from different observational studies and designs can be informative, after which meta-analysis can be employed to obtain a composite result. 25 ) The independent risks of IIV and PCV13 with respect to seizures will be examined in a separate study, 26 using the SCRI design retrospectively on mature data and implementing adjustments similar to those used in the PRISM study of 2010-2011 IIV. 12 Although the signal did not appear until Analysis 7, conducted on 10 March 2014, 19 it is worth considering if and when the system would have signaled under circumstances of a true increased risk of the magnitude found for Fluvax and Fluvax Junior in Australia in 2010. The ratio of observed to expected in that instance was approximately 9. 27 This is an important example, because the risk identified was sufficiently high to result in changes to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for the U.S.-equivalent of the Fluvax vaccine (Afluria, CSL Limited) 27 and to lead to label changes mentioning the seizures risk and restricting the FDAapproved usage of Afluria to children aged 5 years or older. 28 Through simulations, we found that, if the true RR of seizures among 6-to 23-month-olds receiving concomitant IIV and PCV13 vaccines had been 9, as it was for Fluvax, the probability of seeing a vaccine safety surveillance using fresh data signal would have been 90% by Analysis 4 (Figure 2), which was conducted on 9 January 2014. 19 By Analysis 6, conducted on 18 February 2014, 19 the power to see a signal in the case of a true RR as low as 4 was almost 80%. Instead of restricting ourselves to the relatively small group of 6-to 23-month-olds receiving PCV13 concomitantly with IIV in which our signal occurred, we could consider all 6-to 23-month-olds, summing the expected counts for the children with IIV with and without concomitant PCV13 and repeating the simulations. As can be seen in the resulting Figure 3, the probability of detecting a signal for a given true RR was higher at earlier looks than in Figure 2. For example, by Look 4 the probability of detecting a signal in the case of a true RR as low as 4 was 90%.",

            "text": "There are some significant limitations to conducting surveillance using fresh, frequently updated data, particularly for influenza vaccine safety monitoring. One is cost. Processing, quality-checking, and analyzing fresh data were resource-intensive for both Data Partners Figure 1. Trajectories of IIV doses, seizure relative risks (RRs), and log likelihood ratios (LLRs) for 6-to 23-month-olds with concomitant PCV13 over the course of sequential analysis. The LLR was set to 0 where RR < 1. CvsH refers to the current vs. historical analysis, SCRI to the self-controlled risk interval analysis. The LLR critical values for the two analysis methods were too close to distinguish from each other; the horizontal purple line represents the LLR critical values (CV) of both. A statistical signal emerged from the current vs. historical analysis in Test #7, and the RR was 2.7 by Test #10. No statistical signal appeared with the SCRI analysis; the RR at Test #10 was 1.4 Figure 2. Probability of signaling with the Poisson maxSPRT for a given relative risk at a given look, using the actual expected counts for the 6-to 23-monthold IIV+PCV13 concomitant vaccinees in 2013-2014 and a required minimum-number-of-observed-cases-to-signal of 3. The midpoint of the color scale, yellow, was set to correspond to 0.50, such that values >0.50 are greenish and values <0.50 are reddish. * The expected count at each look was based on Data Partner-specific background rates and the cumulative number of IIV doses administered concomitantly with PCV13 to 6-to 23-month-olds as of that look, with data lag adjustment applied. and coordinating center because of the non-routine nature of the work and the frequency of data-processing. To institutionalize such a system would require developing new infrastructure capabilities. Doing so would lower the incremental cost of monitoring additional products. Another problem is the unpredictability of events affecting data quality and timeliness. Although two serious data quality problems were found and resolved during the 2012-2013 pilot season, there were a number of system-wide changes or other events at the Data Partners in the 2013-2014 surveillance season, 19 which, if not noticed and addressed, would have affected data quality and which did lead to delays in data provision. Related to the dynamic, unsettled nature of fresh data, using such data requires particularly careful scrutiny of statistical signals. The comparison of fresh vs. mature data for the 2012-2013 season identified some differences in dose counts, case counts, and risk estimates between the two data types. 19 Risk estimates were more divergent between fresh and mature data for SCRI analyses than for current-vs.-historical analyses. These differences between results from fresh and mature data were likely related to low case counts in the SCRI analysis and consequent instability of risk estimates. Inaccuracies in the lag adjustment might have been a factor, too, considering that the lag characterization was necessarily conducted on older data, and timeliness of claims data-processing may have changed.",

Even with the more timely currentvs.-historical analysis, the statistical signal for seizures in 6-to 23-month-old concomitant IIV and PCV13 vaccinees was not discovered until March 2014, after the influenza season was essentially over. Statistical power and time-to-signal would be more favorable if the sample size were larger, achievable with a larger surveillance system (more data partners), longer surveillance, a wider age range, or a more common outcome. Longer surveillance seems a particularly feasible option where products other than influenza vaccine are concerned.",

The potential for detecting clinically significant risks in a timely fashion, even in a quite small age group, is illustrated by Figures 2 and 3. The true advantage of fresh data is best viewed by comparing a surveillance system that can detect safety concerns at levels that might impact policy just months after initial product uptake with a system using mature data that must wait a year or more to assess the safety of a product.",
