            "text": "Background Data on the prevalence of adverse drug event (ADE)-related emergency department (ED) visits in developing countries are limited. Malaysia is located in SouthEast Asia, and, to our knowledge, no information exists on ADE-related ED visits. Objective The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence, preventability, severity, and outcome of drug-related ED visits. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted in consenting patients who visited the ED of Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia over a 6-week period. The ED physician on duty determined whether or not the visit was drug related according to set criteria. Other relevant information was extracted from the patient's medical folder by a clinical pharmacist. Results Of the 434 consenting patients, 133 (30.6 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 26-35 %) visits were determined to be ADE related; 55.5 % were considered preventable, 11.3 % possibly preventable, and 33.1 % not preventable. Severity was classed as mild in 1.5 %, moderate in 67.7 %, and severe in 30.8 %. The most common ADEs reported were drug therapeutic failure (55.6 %) and adverse drug reactions (32.3 %). The most frequently implicated drugs were antidiabetics (n = 31; 23.3 %), antihypertensives (n = 28; 21.1 %), antibiotics (n = 13; 9.8 %), and antiasthmatics (n = 11; 8.3 %). A total of 93 patients (69.9 %) were admitted to the ED for observation, 25 (18.8 %) were discharged immediately after consultation, and 15 (11.3 %) were admitted to the ward through the ED. Conclusion The prevalence of ADE-related ED visits was high; more than one-half of the events were considered preventable and one-third was classed as severe. As such, preventive measures will minimize future occurrences and increase patient safety. Key Points Three in ten patients seeking care at the emergency department of a teaching hospital in Malaysia were for events associated with drug use. Drug therapeutic failure due to medication nonadherence was the most commonly reported adverse drug event.",

ADEs have been identified as a major public health concern and are responsible for a high level of morbidity and mortality worldwide [2]. In the USA, ADEs accounted for 17 million emergency department (ED) visits and 8.7 million hospital admissions annually [3]. ADEs occur in all clinical settings and are responsible for 0.77-37.6 % of ED visits [4][5][6]. They also contributed to an increase in healthcare cost, loss of productivity, increased hospital stay and time away from work, as well as lower patient satisfaction [7][8][9]. In Canada, ADEs were responsible for a total annual cost of $Can35.7 million in 2008 [10].",

If the patient had other symptoms related to drug use, and the chief presenting complaint was not related to these, the ED visit was considered not ADE related. ADE-related ED visits were classified into the following five categories. (1) Adverse drug reaction (ADR)-a ''response to a drug that is noxious or unintended, and that occurs at doses normally used for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease'' [9]. (2) Drug therapeutic failure (DTF)-an absence of therapeutic response (deterioration of disease state or condition) to a drug that could be linked causally either to a prescribed dose that was too low, medication non-adherence, recent dose reduction and interaction, or inadequate monitoring [16]. The visit was regarded as due to DTF when caused by medication nonadherence where the patient's drug-taking behavior did not correspond with agreed recommendations from the healthcare provider, resulting in a disease or condition not stabilizing or symptoms worsening [17]. (3) Accidental drug overdoseunintentional administration of a drug (set at an amount higher than the normal recommended therapeutic dose, that has the potential to cause harm, e.g., a young child or an adult with impaired mental abilities swallowing medication left within their grasp or an adult mistakenly taking an incorrect drug or dose) [3]. (4) Intentional drug overdose-deliberate administration of a drug at an amount higher than the normal recommended dose, that has the potential to cause harm (e.g., for the purpose of self-harm, suicide attempts, or to achieve euphoric state) [3]. (5) Untreated indication-when the chief presenting complaint is related to a disease or condition that requires a drug therapy and the patient did not seek or receive such therapy (possibly due to mental illness or ignorance of the disease condition) [3].",

A prevalence of 30.6 % (95 % CI 26-35) for ADE-related ED visits was determined within the 6-week period. More than one-half of the ADEs were determined to have been preventable, and almost one-third had a severe outcome. The prevalence rate found in the current study is consistent with results of previous studies  [23][24][25][26]. In contrast, the prevalence rate was higher than in other studies performed in England, Finland, Canada, and Taiwan, which were in the range of 0.77-4.0 % [24,[27][28][29][30]. In the current study, the rate of ADE-related admissions to the ward through the ED was 11.3 %, which is similar to rates found in a study conducted in Malaysia (12.7 %) [31]. The high prevalence rate found in this study may be due to a broader definition of ADE, eligibility criteria, and study population used. This was adopted to ensure a comprehensive knowledge of ADE-related hospitalization. Moreover, the high proportion of patients with DTF may also be responsible for the high prevalence rate.",

This was in agreement with previous studies [27,32,33]. The female sex has been identified as a risk factor associated with ADE-related ED visits [23,25,34,35]. This is possibly due to the increased bioavailability of drugs, greater sensitivity of female target organs to drugs, and polypharmacy due to gender-specific treatments [36]. ADE-related complaints at the ED in the current study were higher among the elderly. This was consistent with findings of previous studies [4,7,24,37]. This could possibly be because the body's ability to handle drugs diminishes with age, leading to changes in drug pharmacokinetics, altered organ responses, and homeostatic counter-regulation to drug effects [38]. More patients without formal education had ADE-related ED visits than patients with higher education. Similar studies have shown that patients with a higher level of education have a better perception of the risks of ADEs [39]. A higher level of education brings a greater conscious awareness of the risks associated with drug use. Many previous studies on prevalence of ADEs did not evaluate marital status [13]. However, our study reveals a significant difference in ADE occurrence within married, divorced, and single patients, with a married population having a higher percentage of patients with ADE-related ED visits. Similarly, Chrischilles et al. [40,41] and Hema et al. [40,41] also found that a higher proportion of patients with ADE were married. An explanation for this within the current study may be that over 40 % of the patients with ADEs were elderly and more than one-half were females, who were earlier found to have a higher incidence of ADE-related hospitalization.",

            "text": "The ADE category with the highest prevalence rate in the current study was DTF, which accounted for more than one-half of ADE-related ED visits. This is consistent with a similar study conducted in a hospital ward in Malaysia [22]. In the current study, medication non-adherence was the major cause of DTF-related ED visits. The prevalence rate of DTF due to medication non-adherence reported was higher than that found in previous studies [8,15,[42][43][44]. This variation may be due to more patients with chronic diseases visiting our ED with ADE-related complaints. However, patients with underlying chronic illness were found to have a higher chance of medication non-adherence [43]. Another reason for the higher prevalence rate of DTF due to medication non-adherence may be associated  with the busy and overcrowded nature of some public hospitals in Malaysia, which may not allow adequate patient counseling, especially regarding medication adherence [45,46]. Medication non-adherence has become a silent burden of healthcare [39,44,47]; thus, many intervention measures have been made to improve adherence to increase patient safety. Such interventions include patient education via verbal and written instructions, illustrations, and audiovisuals by healthcare providers, and reminders such as medication calendars, medication schedule alerts, stickers, box alarms, and pill timers. In Malaysia, efforts have been made to improve medication adherence, including the use of short message alerts, called MySMS \u00d2 , in some hospitals [48] and the establishment of Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) services operated by pharmacists in some public hospitals. These services have resulted in significant improvements in medication adherence [49]. Studies have shown that pharmacist interventions have played a major role in improving medication adherence, especially among patients with chronic illness. The pharmacist is an expert on drugs and has the skills and expertise to improve medication adherence and potentially minimize the prevalence of DTF-related ED visits [50,51]. More intervention measures are needed to improve medication adherence.",

            "text": "In the current study, ADRs account for one-third of the ADE-related ED visits. This rate is consistent with similar studies conducted in India [52] and in hospital wards in Malaysia and Germany [33,38]. Hypoglycemia was the most common complaint associated with ADRs, mainly related to antidiabetic therapy (gliclazide and insulin). The high rate of ADRs in the current study may be explained by the poor ADR monitoring and reporting system in Malaysia. Despite the establishment of the Malaysian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee (MADRAC) in 1987 to receive and monitor ADR reporting, the response is still very low compared with other countries [53]. Reports have identified some of the factors associated with under-reporting of ADRs in Malaysia, including (1) lack of awareness on the importance of and the need for ADR monitoring and reporting, (2) uncertainty about whether or not the event was an ADR, (3) opinion that the reaction was too trivial or well known to report, (4) lack of knowledge on how to report, and (5) inadequate time for reporting [54]. If ADRs are not reported, then, predictably, the extent of the occurrence, the people at risk, and the drugs involved will not be well known. As such, preventive interventions will be hampered, leading to increasing numbers of ADRs. Another reason for the high ADR prevalence rate in our study may be related to the current treatment guidelines for DM and the poor glycemic control associated with oral antidiabetic drugs. In Malaysia, prevalence of DM is high, at 20 % [55,56], and the majority of patients have experienced sub-optimal glycemic control with oral hypoglycemic drugs. Thus, early insulin therapy has been included in the current treatment guidelines for DM, and this has led to increased levels of insulin use [57,58]. However, this may be responsible for the high prevalence of ADRs related to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in the current study. Healthcare providers should therefore discuss and monitor insulin therapy with their patient, with regards to possible ADRs and how to manage hypoglycemia associated with the therapy.",

A high proportion of females experienced severe outcomes from ADEs due to ADRs and DTF, which is also consistent with previous studies [42,62]. These findings have shown the healthcare challenges posed by DTF and ADRs, and hence, the urgent need for interventions to prevent further occurrences. There were no reports of death or permanent disability within the current study, although two patients presented with SJS, involving oral cloxacillin and a topical skincare cream containing collagen (Dnarz \u00d2 ). This is similar to a retrospective cohort study among patients of Asian descent, which found cloxacillin to be among the drugs causing SJS [63]. The pathogenesis of SJS was believed to be due to genetic susceptibility, therefore, more pharmacogenomics studies are needed to determine the drugs and groups of people at high risk of SJS [63].",

Therefore, a need exists for a clinical pharmacist in the ED, for adequate detection, reporting, and preventing of ADEs. Pharmacists, as drug experts, specialize in recognizing ADEs in all clinical settings. Consequently, most physicians lack adequate knowledge and expertise to detect and report ADEs, and it has been reported that over 40 % of ADEs presented at EDs were misdiagnosed by ED physicians [64].",

This may be associated with the higher number of patients with chronic illness reported in the study. Insulin, furosemide, salbutamol, gliclazide, and amlodipine were the most commonly reported drugs. Similar studies have shown that these drugs have been associated with an increased likelihood of ADE-related ED visits [50,69,70]. Amphetamine was commonly associated with intentional drug overdose among male patients. This indicates a need for close monitoring and patient counseling when prescribing and dispensing such drugs given their potential to cause ADEs leading to ED visits.",
