            "text": "N-acetyl serotonin (NAS) as a melatonin precursor has neuroprotective actions. Nonetheless, it is not clarified how NAS protects neuronal cells against oxidative stress. Recently, we have reported that N-palmitoyl serotonins possessed properties of antioxidants and neuroprotection. Based on those, we hypothesized that NAS, a N-acyl serotonin, may have similar actions in oxidative stress-induced neuronal cells, and examined the effects of NAS based on in vitro and in vivo tests. NAS dose-dependently inhibited oxidative stress-induced cell death in HT-22 cells. Moreover, NAS suppressed glutamate-induced apoptosis by suppressing expression of AIF, Bax, calpain, cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3, whereas it enhanced expression of Bcl-2. Additionally, NAS improved phosphorylation of tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) and cAMP response elementbinding protein (CREB) as well as expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whereas the inclusion of each inhibitor of JNK, p38 or Akt neutralized the neuroprotective effect of NAS, but not that of ERK. Meanwhile, NAS dose-dependently reduced the level of reactive oxygen species, and enhanced the level of glutathione in glutamate-treated HT-22 cells. Moreover, NAS significantly increased expression of heme oxygenase-1, NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase-1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit as well as nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor-2. Separately, NAS at 30 mg/kg suppressed scopolamine-induced memory impairment and cell death in CA1 and CA3 regions in mice. In conclusion, NAS shows actions of antioxidant and anti-apoptosis by activating TrkB/CREB/BDNF pathway and expression of antioxidant enzymes in oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity. Therefore, such effects of NAS may provide the information for the application of NAS against neurodegenerative diseases."

            "text": "Alzheimer's disease, one of the neurodegenerative diseases, is induced by accumulation of amyloid \u03b2-peptides in neuronal cells [1]. In early stage, patients of Alzheimer's disease have memory impairment clinically [1]. Besides, the accumulation of amyloid \u03b2-peptides in neuronal cells is known as generating elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1]. Consequently, oxidative stress leads to cell death in neuronal cells [2]. Therefore, the regulation of ROS generation is very important to prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, gluta-mate (PubChem CID: 611) treatment of neuronal cells is known to cause generation of ROS through receptor-mediated excitotoxicity [3] or non-receptor-mediated cytotoxicity [2]. Therefore, the glutamate treatment for in intro assay is commonly used for screening antioxidant activity of a novel drug candidate in neuronal cells. Scopolamine (PubChem CID: 5184) is known as an antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor [4], and causing memory impairment in rodents [5,6] and humans [7]. In addition, scopolamine induces oxidative stress in brain [8], and reduces formation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neuronal cells [9]. Therefore, administration of scopolamine for in vivo experiment is generally used as a model of memory impairment for Alzheimer's disease.",

Therefore, it was hypothesized that NAS might have similar properties of N-palmitoyl serotonin.

Finally, we propose novel molecular mechanisms for neuroprotective properties of NAS using immunoblotting analysis, and hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining assay.

As shown in Fig. 4, NAS dramatically reduced ROS level at \u226550 \u03bcM (Fig. 4a), and significantly recovered GSH level at \u2265100 \u03bcM (Fig. 4b) in glutamate-treated HT-22 cells.

As shown in Fig. 4c, NAS dose-dependently enhanced the expression of the enzymes at 12 h. Meanwhile, in early stage (2 h), it enhanced nuclear translocation of Nrf2 while decreasing the Nrf2 level in cytosol (Fig. 4d).

Thus, we further examined effect of NAS on activation of intermediate proteins such as ERK, JNK, p38 or Akt, because the activation of the proteins is known to be related to Nrf2 translocation in neuronal cells [2]. When HT-22 cells were preincubated with NAS in combination with each inhibitor of ERK (PD98059), JNK (SP600125), p38 (SB203580) or Akt (MK-2206) before glutamate treatment, SP600125, SB203580 or MK-2206 significantly neutralized neuroprotective effect of NAS, but not PD98059 (Fig. 5a). Especially, MK-2206 among those inhibitors remarkably reversed the action of NAS. Moreover, it significantly reduced nuclear translocation of Nrf2 induced by NAS, and increased the levels of cytosolic Nrf2 (Fig. 5b). Collectively, these results suggest that the activation of Akt is closely associated with nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in neuronal cells. Therefore, NAS can regulate expression of antioxidant enzymes mainly through activation of Akt/Nrf2 pathway.",

When mice were orally administrated with NAS (1 or 30 mg/kg) 30 min prior to scopolamine challenge, NAS at 30 mg/kg not only reduced the escape latency time (Fig. 6a), but also improved the number of platform (Fig. 6b) as well as the latency time (Fig. 6c) in scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice. Moreover, NAS at the same dose enhanced the number of neuronal cells in CA1 (Fig. 7a) and CA3 regions (Fig. 7b). Taken together, NAS exerts neuroprotective action by protecting neuronal cells in the animal model of Alzheimer's disease.",

In support of this, NAS not only reduced formation of apoptotic cells, but also restored mitochondrial membrane potential by regulating pro-apoptotic factors such as Bax, calpain, cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3 and AIF as well as antiapoptotic factor such as Bcl-2 in glutamate-treated neuronal cells.

Consistent with this, we reported that N-acyl serotonins reduced ROS generation, and enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes in neuronal cells and the brain tissue of mice [2,9]. Such effect of N-acyl serotonins is concerned with nuclear translocation of Nrf2 [2]. In the present study, NAS not only inhibited ROS generation, but also enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes through activation of Akt/Nrf2 pathway in neuronal cells. Therefore, it is suggested that NAS may activate expression of antioxidant enzymes mainly through activation of Akt/Nrf2 pathway. Such effect of NAS is another important mechanism for its neuroprotective actions, although the expression of antioxidant enzymes by NAS is not clarified in the relation with TrkB signaling pathway. Although NAS shows a neuroprotective action similar to that of N-palmitoyl serotonin, the effective concentration of NAS is much higher than that of N-palmitoyl serotonin. Thus, there may be a great difference in the fate of NAS.

The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, AIF, calpain, cytochrome c (Cyto C), cleaved caspase-3 (CleaCas-3), phospho-TrkB, TrkB, phospho-CREB, BDNF or \u03b2-actin was determined as described in materials and methods. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 versus Glutamate-treated group.

HT-22 cells were preincubated with or without N-acetyl serotonin in combination with each inhibitor of intermediate proteins for 30 min before glutamate challenge. After 12 h, cell viability was measured as described in materials and methods. Data are the mean \u00b1 SD values of triple determinations. Separately, HT-22 cells were preincubated with or without N-acetyl serotonin and MK-2206 (5 \u03bcM) for 30 min before glutamate challenge. After 2 h, the expression of Nrf2 or LaminB was determined as described in materials and methods. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, or #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 versus Glutamate-treated group, or glutamate with NAS-treated group, respectively.
