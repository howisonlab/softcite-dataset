MUMMALS improves alignment quality by using pairwise alignment hidden Markov models (HMMs) with multiple match states that describe local structural information without exploiting explicit structure predictions. Parameters for such models have been estimated from a large library of structure-based alignments. We show that (i) on remote homologs, MUMMALS achieves statistically best accuracy among several leading aligners, such as ProbCons, MAFFT and MUSCLE, albeit the average improvement is small, in the order of several percent; (ii) a large collection (.10 000) of automatically computed pairwise structure alignments of divergent protein domains is superior to smaller but carefully curated datasets for estimation of alignment parameters and performance tests; (iii) reference-independent evaluation of alignment quality using sequence alignmentdependent structure superpositions correlates well with reference-dependent evaluation that compares sequence-based alignments to structure-based reference alignments."

For each domain pair from the same superfamily of SCOP40, we computed a structural alignment using the program DaliLite (26). Alignments with coverage (fraction of aligned region to the length of the shorter sequence) less than 0.6 were removed. The remaining alignments were divided into four datasets corresponding to four sequence identity bins: <10, 10-15, 15-20 and 20-40%. The method for calculating sequence identity that takes into account unaligned regions is described in Supplementary Data. To apply cross validation training and testing, we divided the domain pairs in each identity bin into four subsets at the SCOP fold level, so that no domains belonging to the same SCOP fold were shared by any two subsets. We estimated HMM parameters using alignments in three subsets and tested the programs on representative domain pairs of the remaining fourth subset. This procedure was performed four times corresponding to four ways of partitioning into training and testing datasets. To obtain representative alignments from a subset for testing, we randomly selected one domain pair from each SCOP fold in that subset. The number of domain pairs in each training dataset is larger than 10 000 (Supplementary Table S1).",

(a) An illustration of structure-based sequence alignment and hidden state paths. In Sequences 1 and 2, uppercase letters and lowercase letters represent aligned core blocks and unaligned regions, respectively. If two corresponding unaligned regions bounded by the same two core blocks are of different length, we split the shorter one into two pieces and introduce contiguous gaps in the middle. For both N-and C-terminal ends, the shorter unaligned region is pushed toward the core blocks. Secondary structure (ss) types (helix, 'h'; strand, 'e'; coil, 'c') are shown for Sequence 1. The hidden state paths for three models are shown below the amino acid sequences. (b) Model structure of HMM_1_1_0. Residue pairs in unaligned regions are modeled using the same match state ('M') as those in the aligned blocks. Insertions in the first sequence and second sequence are modeled using states 'X' and 'Y', respectively. (c) Model structure of HMM_1_1_1. Residue pairs in the unaligned regions are modeled using a different match state ('U') than the match state in the core blocks ('M'). (d) Model structure of HMM_1_3_1. Residue pairs in aligned core blocks are modeled using three match states ('H', 'S', 'C') according to three secondary structure types of the first sequence. In (b), (c) and (d), match states are shown as squares and insertion states are shown as diamonds. Begin state, end state, and transitions from or to them are present in these models, but are not shown. (Figure 1a). Residue pairs in aligned core blocks can be modeled by a match state ('M'). If the two unaligned regions in between two core blocks have different and non-zero lengths, they can be modeled using a different 'match' state ('U', for unaligned) ( Figure 1c) and 'X' or 'Y' state. This is done by evenly splitting the unaligned residues in the sequence with the shorter unaligned region into two segments, placing them beside the two adjacent core blocks and separating them by a single stretch of gap symbols. In this way, transitions between 'X' and 'Y' do not occur. The residue pair emission probabilities of these artificially forced matches in unaligned regions ('U') are expected to be different from those in the core blocks ('M'). This model (HMM_1_1_1) has two distinct match states: 'M' and 'U' (Figure 1a and c).",

Secondary structure types were assigned using program DSSP (27) for SCOP domains. The model that incorporates three secondary structure types ('H': helix, 'S': strand and 'C': coil) of the first sequence and unaligned match state ('U') is named HMM_1_3_1 (Figure 1d). Similarly, multiple match states can be introduced based on several solvent accessibility categories, or a combination of solvent accessibility categories and secondary structure types. Solvent accessibilities of residue sidechains were calculated by program NACCESS (28). Three solvent accessibility categories were used based on our previous studies (29). The model that incorporates three solvent accessibility categories and unaligned match state is named HMM_3_1_1. Combination of three solvent accessibility categories and three secondary structure types results in nine classes of match states for the core blocks (model HMM_3_3_1).",

The Q-score is the fraction of the number of correctly aligned residue pairs in the test alignment to the total number of aligned residue pairs in the reference alignment. Additional series of smaller datasets constructed by MAFFT authors (11) were 55 HOMSTRAD (34) structural alignments with various numbers of close homologs added ('HOM + X', 'X' is the number of close homologs added and is 0, 20, 50 or 100). To obtain more balanced datasets from 'HOM + 100', we used BLASTCLUST to cluster sequences in any 'HOM + 100' alignment at 50 or 60% identity level, and selected up to two homologs in each sequence cluster. The resulting datasets are called 'HOM + 100_bcl50' and 'HOM + 100_bcl60'. We also tested programs on 218 BAliBASE3.0 (35) alignments with full-length sequences. The column scores (the fraction of entirely correct columns) were reported in addition to Q-scores for BAliBASE3.0. Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests were performed to calculate statistical significance of comparisons between alignment programs, which include ProbCons (version 1.10) (23), MAFFT (version 5.667) (11) with several options, MUSCLE (version 3.52) (10) and ClustalW (version 1.83) (7).",

Given a test sequence alignment of two SCOP domains with known structures, corresponding Ca atoms in aligned residue pairs were used as equivalent points for structural superposition to minimize the root mean square distance (RMSD). The structural similarity scores were calculated based on this forced superposition of the aligned residue pairs. The following scores were used: DALI Z-score (36), GDT score (37), TM-score (38), 3D-score (39) and two LiveBench contact scores (39) (see Supplementary Data for the equations of 3D-score and LiveBench contact scores). An alignment with better quality should have a higher similarity of the two structures superimposed in a sequencedependent way described above, and thus have a larger structural score. Two reference-independent sequence similarity scores were also calculated for aligned residue pairs in a test alignment: sequence identity and average BLOSUM62 scores (16). Additionally, each of the scores was rescaled to take into account a random model (the reversed alignment), self-comparisons and alignment coverage (see Supplementary Data for details). Such rescaling places each score between 0 (random match) and 1 (self-match) and makes different scoring schemes more comparable to each other.",

            "text": "Several conclusions can be drawn from Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3. (i) For each testing dataset, the best performance is usually achieved with parameters estimated on the training dataset with the same identity range ( Supplementary Table S3). For example, models trained on alignments with the highest identity range (20-40%) exhibit best performance on testing alignments in that range. Thus residue substitution and insertion/deletion statistics are different for sequence pairs with different degrees of similarity, in agreement with other reports (16,17). Although models trained on pairs with the lowest identity range can perform slightly better (2%) on representatives in that range, they perform much worse on alignments with the highest identity range (nearly 10% decrease as compared to models trained on pairs with the highest identity range). (ii) More complex HMMs improve alignment quality. For example, HMM_1_3_1 performs better than HMM_1_1_1 in almost every case. HMM_1_3_1 performs almost equally well to HMM_3_3_1. (iii) Our models trained on pairs with 20-40% identity range perform better than several other aligners, such as ProbCons (23), MAFFT (11) with several option, MUSCLE (10) and ClustalW (7) on any testing dataset. Although the simplest model HMM_1_1_0 has the same model structure as the one used in ProbCons, it gives 3-4% increase over ProbCons for every testing dataset. The best models HMM_1_3_1 and HMM_3_3_1 give 4-5% increase over ProbCons. (iv) When trained on BAliBASE2.0, HMM_1_1_0 and HMM_1_1_1 exhibit inferior performance compared to the same models trained on SCOP domain pairs with identity above 20%, suggesting that SCOP domain pairs with above 20% identity is a better training dataset than BAliBASE2.0. The two models (especially HMM_1_1_1) trained on BAliBASE2.0 nevertheless give slightly better performance than ProbCons, which was also trained on BAliBASE2.0 but with a different training method (unsupervised learning) (23).",

The results of MUMMALS on 'HOM + 100' are inferior to those on 'HOM + 50', which is in contrast to MAFFT that shows consistent increase of accuracy when more homologs are added. We reason that such a problem of MUMMALS is due to excessive number of close homologs in some sequence subgroups in 'HOM + 100' test cases, since our consistency measure does not take into account similarities among the testing sequences. To test this hypothesis, we removed closely related sequences in 'HOM + 100' alignment at 50 or 60% identity level (datasets 'HOM + 100_bcl50' and 'HOM + 100_bcl60'). The remaining sequences are more balanced in terms of similarities among them. We indeed obtained the best MUMMALS performance after removing closely related sequences (Supplementary Table S5).

            "text": "Recently, BAliBASE3.0 multiple alignment benchmark has been released (35). We tested the programs on 218 BAliBASE3.0 alignments with full-length sequences. These alignments represent difficult cases since N-or C-terminal non-homologous regions are included for some sequences. The average Q-scores and column scores (the fraction of entirely correctly columns) in manually defined core blocks are reported in Table 2. For Q-score measurement of alignment quality, the Wilcoxon signed rank tests show that MUMMALS with best-performing models (HMM_3_3_1 or HMM_1_3_1) is statistically better than other programs, albeit MUMMALS does not have the highest average Q-score. For column score measurement of alignment quality, MUMMALS with HMM_3_3_1 or HMM_1_3_1 has a lower average column score than MAFFT-[le]insi and ProbCons, but the difference between them is not statistically significant. In fact MUMMALS with HMM_3_3_1 outperforms MAFFT-linsi (having the best average scores) in 106 cases while MAFFT-linsi performs better in 67 cases, measured by column score. We found that the major cause of lower average column score of MUMMALS is due to a few alignments that MUMMALS gives considerably lower scores as compared to MAFFT-linsi (10 alignments with a score difference larger than 0.5). Manual inspections of these alignments revealed some interesting scenarios. In some cases, the low scores of MUMMALS are due to wrong alignment of a few divergent sequences, some of which have long extensions at the ends. Column score is very sensitive in such situations, since a low score is produced even if only one sequence is incorrectly aligned in many places. MAFFT alignments with local options ([le]insi) indeed show advantage in these situations (11). In several other cases, MUMMALS produces structurally meaningful alignments that are scored very low since they are not consistent with the reference alignments (Supplementary Figure S1). One example is testing case BB40037, for which the reference alignment aligns the 'fer2' domain [2Fe-2S iron sulfur cluster binding domain, named by Conserved Domain Database (42)] that is present in every sequence. Inspection of the sequences revealed two groups of sequences with different domain architectures in BB40037 (Supplementary Figure S1a). One group contains three domains in the order of 'fer2', 'FAD_binding_6' (oxidoreductase FAD-binding domain) and 'NAD_binding_1' (oxidoreductase NAD-binding domain). The other group contains the same three domains, but in the order of 'FAD_binding_6', 'NAD_binding_1' and 'fer2'. MUMMALS aligns 'FAD_binding_6' and 'NAD_binding_1' for the two groups and thus misaligned the 'fer2' domain. Since the reference-dependent evaluation is based on 'fer2' domain, MUMMALS alignment gets a column score of zero. Another evaluation problem is caused by domain duplication or repeats, as exemplified by test case BB40040. Most of BB40040 sequences have a single domain of carbonic anhydrase. However, the sequence 'CAH_DUNSA' has two such domains (Supplementary Figure S1b). The reference alignment aligns the first domain of 'CAH_DUNSA' to other sequences while MUMMALS aligns most of the second domain to other sequences, resulting in a low column score.",

It is unclear how the quality of reference 'gold' alignments influences the ranking of alignment programs (45). Several examples from BAliBASE3.0 show some problems with referencedependent evaluation. Since the structures of all domains in our testing datasets are known, we can evaluate the quality of a test alignment using reference-independent scores that reflect the similarity between two structures after they are superimposed according to aligned residues in the test alignment. The structural scores we have used are: DALI Z-score, TM-score, GDT-TS score, 3D-score and two LiveBench contact scores. From Table 3, it is clear that MUMMALS with the best-performing models (HMM_1_3_1 and HMM_3_3_1) produces higher average referenceindependent structural scores than other programs for divergent domain pairs (identity below 20%), suggesting that our HMM models produce potentially more useful alignments in terms of structure modeling. Interestingly, MUMMALS does not produce the highest reference-independent sequencebased similarity scores (sequence identity and BLOSUM62 scores of aligned residue pairs). This result suggests that minimization of these sequence similarity measures alone does not lead to better alignment quality for divergent sequences. Our experiments with reference-independent evaluation shows good correlation with reference-dependent results described above, thus rendering a 'gold standard' reference unnecessary for alignment evaluation.",

Although this improvement is statistically significant and does not depend on the testing dataset (assembled by us, or by other researchers) or alignment quality measure (referencedependent Q-score, or reference-independent DALI Z-score, TM-score, GDT-TS, etc), it is not clear what these average scores actually represent. To gain more understanding, we directly compared alignment scores of different programs for individual domain pairs. Table 4 shows the number of alignments where one program performs better than another program by 10% or more (measured by Q-score or normalized TM-score) for 1207 divergent SCOP40 pairs with added homologs (sequence identity <20%). The numbers for such differences among MUMMALS family of programs with five different HMMs are relatively small, suggesting that MUMMALS with different HMMs generates alignments not that different from each other. The differences between MUMMALS and other programs are significantly larger. For example, MUMMALS with HMM_3_3_1 has a large Q-score increase (>10%) over ProbCons on 201 alignments, while ProbCons is better by 10% or more on 62 alignments. For MUMMALS with HMM_3_3_1 and MAFFT-ginsi, these numbers are 199 and 117, respectively. Our comparisons thus suggest that different programs can explore somewhat different regions in alignment space, and the program giving lower average performance may be capable of generating better alignments in many cases. However, selection of a better alignment in the absence of structural comparison is still a difficult task (46).",

Recent versions of MAFFT enhance performance by exploring aligned core regions with a simple consistency measure (11). However, the time-consuming ProbCons-type consistency operations on sequence triplets are not implemented in MAFFT.

Second, we have estimated model parameters from DaliLite structural alignments of divergent SCOP domains (<40% identity), while the training data of ProbCons are from BAliBASE2.0. Third, we applied a supervised learning approach to estimating model parameters from structural alignments that have known hidden state paths. ProbCons applied an unsupervised learning approach (expectation maximization) to derive parameters without using reference alignments. Trained and tested on DaliLite structural alignments of SCOP40 domain pairs and on BAliBASE2.0 alignments, our models give better alignment quality than ProbCons and a number of other programs.

HMM_3_3_1 (modeling both secondary structure and solvent accessibility) has the largest number of hidden states and is the most timeconsuming model, running about three times slower than HMM_1_3_1 (modeling only secondary structure). However, the performance of these two models is fairly similar in pairwise or multiple sequence alignment tests (Tables 1-3). HMM_3_1_1 (modeling only solvent accessibility) has the same time complexity as HMM_1_3_1, but usually shows slightly inferior performance to HMM_1_3_1. These observations suggest that HMM_1_3_1 (modeling only secondary structure) is most efficient in balancing alignment accuracy and speed. For MUMMALS, the rate-limiting steps are the computation of match probabilities using forward and backward algorithms (time order is N 2 *L 2 *K 2 , N: number of sequences, L: average length, K: number of hidden states), and the computation of the consistency-based scoring function, which requires operations on all sequence triplets (time order is N 3 *L 2 ). If probabilistic consistency measure is applied to every sequence pair, MUMMALS is much slower than MAFFT, MUSCLE and ClustalW (Supplementary Table S9). For example, the median CPU time of MUMMALS with model HMM_1_3_1 on 1785 SCOP40 pairs with added homologs is 174s per alignment, as compared to 2.5s for MAFFT with 'ginsi' option (on Redhat Enterprise Linux 3, AMD Opteron 2.0 GHz). Applying a two-stage alignment strategy similar to the one used in the program PCMA (32), we were able to make MUMMALS almost an order of magnitude faster while still maintaining the same level of alignment accuracy on SCOP testing datasets ( Supplementary  Table S9). Since highly similar sequences can be aligned accurately with a general scoring function (8), there is no need for all of them to be subject to the time-consuming consistency measure. Although adding homologous sequences can in general improve alignment quality, our results on HOMSTRAD datasets suggest that proper balance of the similarity among the added homologs is also critical for MUMMALS as well as ProbCons.",

Even though structure-based alignments can serve as high-quality references, there are several well-known drawbacks. First, structural alignments generated by automatic programs could still contain errors, especially for pairs with relatively low structural similarity, i.e. careful expert-driven multilateral research may generate alignments more meaningful than those obtained by programs. Second, defining the optimal structural alignment in certain regions is difficult for structurally divergent pairs, i.e. it is simply not possible to identify a single 'correct' alignment, which may not even exist. Third, for multi-domain proteins, especially those with repeats or duplications, multiple ways of aligning structurally similar parts exist, resulting in a variety of reference  Table 1.

Some problems of referencedependent evaluations are illustrated by examples from BAliBASE3.0. For SCOP40 testing datasets, we found about 20 domain pairs for which all sequence-based programs failed to align a single position correctly according to DaliLite reference alignment. Manual inspection of these instances suggests that most of these domains involve structural repeats. Many alignments produced by the tested programs did produce structurally meaningful results, but they had zero scores because they matched different repeats than those aligned by DaliLite."

Although reference-independent evaluation is routinely used for assessing structure prediction models (50,51), it has not been frequently used in assessment of multiple sequence alignment programs (10,45). Our results show that reference-independent evaluation using various structural similarity scores produces similar, if not identical, rankings of the programs compared to reference-dependent evaluations using DaliLite alignments (Table 3). On the one hand, this result suggests that a large collection of reference alignments generated by structure alignment program DaliLite are on average well-suited for assessment of alignment quality. On the other hand, it is probably unnecessary to have a set of 'gold standard' reference alignments. Reference-independent evaluation through scoring superpositions generated according sequence-based alignments is an easier and maybe more fair method to assess alignment quality and to compare different aligners. Therefore, particularly when the size of a testing dataset is large, improving reference alignment quality either by manual inspection and adjustment (30), or by using the consensus of structural aligners (10,33) is probably not necessary. With reference-independent evaluation techniques, we even suggest bypassing the step of generating reference alignments.",

Although the best programs (MUMMALS, MAFFT and ProbCons) have limited differences in terms of average alignment quality score, they can produce quite different alignments for some sequence pairs (Table 4). It can be a good practice to use several aligners to generate alignments for divergent sequences. Manual examination of these alignments can be helpful in making expert judgments. Exploration of the consensus among programs is fruitful as well and is frequently used in meta-servers for structure prediction (52)(53)(54). Results of the meta-aligner M-COFFEE (46) as well as ours (data not shown, MUMMALS package contains a meta-program similar to M-COFFEE) suggest that combining different multiple sequence aligners can give significant but limited improvement of alignment quality.",

Our model HMM_1_3_1 gives low secondary structure prediction accuracy. Providing real secondary structure information to this model can further improve alignment quality by a few percent.

Exploration of database sequence homologs and available 3D structures was also shown to be helpful (11,55,56). Further enhancement of multiple alignment quality could be achieved by effective integration of existing alignment techniques and various evolutionary and structural information resources.",
