            "text": "Objectives. Autologous costal cartilage is a promising alternative for mastoid obliteration. However, donor-site morbidities of the chest wall limit the use of this graft. To address this issue, we have developed a minimally-invasive technique of harvesting costal cartilage and report donor site morbidity associated with the procedure. Methods. Donor site morbidities were evaluated for 151 patients who underwent costal cartilage harvest, canal wall down mastoidectomy, and mastoid obliteration. Pain and cosmetic concern were evaluated via visual analogue scale (VAS). Scars were evaluated via the modified Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Postoperative complications were assessed during the follow-up period. Results. The mean duration of noticeable pain was 5.3 days post operation. The mean VAS score for pain was 3.0 of 10 on the first day after the operation and gradually declined. At the 6 months post operation, the mean VAS cosmetic score at the costal cartilage harvest site was 0.6 of 10. The mean VSS score was 9.5 out of 10 total, and the mean POSAS score was 23.27 out of 110 total. Conclusion. The minimally-invasive chopped costal cartilage harvest technique resulted in acceptable pain, cosmetic concern, and postoperative complications for most patients. There were no major postoperative complications. Costal cartilage is an acceptable donor for mastoid obliteration in canal wall down mastoidectomy, especially in the context of the extremely low donor site morbidity of the minimally-invasive technique presented in the study."

In addition, the final hearing gained after staged ossiculoplasies in patients who have undergone CWD is usually 5-10 dB worse than the patients who have undergone canal wall up (CWU) tympanomastoidectomy due to its ineffective sound transmission [2,3].",

            "text": "Various techniques of mastoid obliteration or canal wall reconstruction have been reported to overcome cavity problems. Several kinds of muscular flap [4,5], fat [6], cortical bone pate [7], hydroxylappatite [8], \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate and polyphosphate [9], demineralized bone matrix [10,11] and silicone blocks [12] are used. However, all of these techniques have its advantages and disadvantages. Bone pate is restricted by its insufficient amount in material and it is vulnerability to infection [13,14]. Fat and muscular flaps have unpredictable absorption rate over the time [6]. Synthetic materials are limited by the need for vascularized flap coverage, infection, incomplete osteointergration, and late extrusion [15]. Black  [13] reported that autologous cartilage is excellent material for canal reconstruction and mastoid obliteration. However, he reported that inadequate amount for filler work from the ear locality and complication risk from the costal supplies limited its appeal as filler [13].",

In this study, the Mexameter was used for two purposes. First, for the sake of objectivity in scoring, the authors score the vascularity and pigmentation of OSAS according to Mexameter value. Second, the Mexameter values were compared between the costal cartilage harvest site and the retroauricular skin incision site, which revealed no significant difference across the two surgical incisions."

However, the authors of the study believe that to perform conventional costal cartilage harvest techniques is perhaps unethical, considering the clinical experiences with the minimally invasive technique. To overcome this limitation, we have adopted various kinds of scar evaluation scales, such as VAS, VSS, POSAS, and Mexameter assessments. In addition to various scar scales, we have compared the costal cartilage harvest site to the retroauricular skin incision site."

However, the PSAS score of costal cartilage harvest site was significantly lower than that of retroauricular skin incision site. We have wondered why some patients scored the costal cartilage harvest site lower, even though they had answered that the overall cosmetic burden of costal cartilage harvest site was less than that of retroauricular skin incision site. We speculate that this discrepancy arises from the difference in a patient's ability to make first-hand observations of the costal cartilage harvest site, where a close observation of the retroauricular site is difficult. Similar values which were evaluated by observer (OSAS) had no statistically significant difference."
