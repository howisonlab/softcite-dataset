To address this issue, we have developed a minimally-invasive technique of harvesting costal cartilage and report donor site morbidity associated with the procedure. Methods. Donor site morbidities were evaluated for 151 patients who underwent costal cartilage harvest, canal wall down mastoidectomy, and mastoid obliteration. Pain and cosmetic concern were evaluated via visual analogue scale (VAS). Scars were evaluated via the modified Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Postoperative complications were assessed during the follow-up period. Results. The mean duration of noticeable pain was 5.3 days post operation. The mean VAS score for pain was 3.0 of 10 on the first day after the operation and gradually declined. At the 6 months post operation, the mean VAS cosmetic score at the costal cartilage harvest site was 0.6 of 10. The mean VSS score was 9.5 out of 10 total, and the mean POSAS score was 23.27 out of 110 total. Conclusion. The minimally-invasive chopped costal cartilage harvest technique resulted in acceptable pain, cosmetic concern, and postoperative complications for most patients. There were no major postoperative complications. Costal cartilage is an acceptable donor for mastoid obliteration in canal wall down mastoidectomy, especially in the context of the extremely low donor site morbidity of the minimally-invasive technique presented in the study.",

In addition, the final hearing gained after staged ossiculoplasies in patients who have undergone CWD is usually 5-10 dB worse than the patients who have undergone canal wall up (CWU) tympanomastoidectomy due to its ineffective sound transmission [2,3].",

            "text": "Various techniques of mastoid obliteration or canal wall reconstruction have been reported to overcome cavity problems. Several kinds of muscular flap [4,5], fat [6], cortical bone pate [7], hydroxylappatite [8], \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate and polyphosphate [9], demineralized bone matrix [10,11] and silicone blocks [12] are used. However, all of these techniques have its advantages and disadvantages. Bone pate is restricted by its insufficient amount in material and it is vulnerability to infection [13,14]. Fat and muscular flaps have unpredictable absorption rate over the time [6]. Synthetic materials are limited by the need for vascularized flap coverage, infection, incomplete osteointergration, and late extrusion [15]. Black  [13] reported that autologous cartilage is excellent material for canal reconstruction and mastoid obliteration. However, he reported that inadequate amount for filler work from the ear locality and complication risk from the costal supplies limited its appeal as filler [13].",

The overlying perichondrium was incised longitudinally along the midline of costal cartilage axis. Using a newly devised cartilage gouge (Fig. 1B), a portion of upper central costal cartilage was harvested. Cartilage and perichondrium of lateral and inferior locations was left intact.

In this study, the VSS score was 8.3\u00b11.2 on postoperative day 1 and gradually increased to 9.5\u00b11.0 by 24 weeks post operation. As a score of 10 indicates an excellent donor site while a score of 0 indicates the worst possible, the 24-week score represented extremely satisfactory donor site outcomes (Fig. 4). Although a direct comparison is not possible, the VSS scores were reported to be 2 and 8.5 on days 1 and 90 post operation in the study on conventional costal cartilage harvest technique [19]. These findings suggest that the minimally-invasive technique presented has resulted in more acceptable scars than that after the conventional harvest procedure.",
