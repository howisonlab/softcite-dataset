Objectives: The presence of VRE isolates from food samples and typing of these isolates with Phene plate, a biochemical fingerprinting method, were investigated. Materials and Methods: Thirty samples of meat, chicken and cheese were analyzed for VRE during 2010. Antibiotic susceptibility tests and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were also examined. VRE isolates were typed with the Phene plate system (PhPlate), a biochemical fingerprinting method. Results: A total of 70 VRE isolates were obtained and identified as Enterococcus faecium by species-specific PCR. All the isolates carried vanA, while none of them harbored vanB. The VRE isolates included 35, 27, and 8 isolates from meat, chicken and cheese, respectively. Typing with the PhPlate revealed a diversity index of 0.78 for E. faecium, containing 10 common and four single types. The results of antibiotic susceptibility and MIC tests showed an increased resistance to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, ampicillin and gentamicin, to which, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 95% of VRE isolates were resistant, respectively. Only 5% of the isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol and the MIC of the isolates for vancomycin and teicoplanin was \u2265 256 \u00b5g/mL and for gentamicin-resistant isolates it was 1024 \u00b5g/mL. Conventional and molecular identification tests exhibited that all the isolates were E. faecium carrying vanA. None of the isolates harbored vanB. Conclusions: The results showed that enterococci are common contaminants in food. Indeed, this study indicates a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant enterococci in food of animal origin in Iran. Isolating some persisting enterococcal isolates revealed that continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci from food is essential.",

            "text": "Enterococci are pervasive and predominant inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, found in soil, water and food (1). For many years, they were considered as normal flora and unharmful to man (2). However, over the last years, enterococci have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens, representing an increasingly important problem for public health (3). Indeed, these bacteria have a great ability to acquire resistance to some antimicrobial agents such as glycopeptides, in particular vancomycin, which are important for human therapy (4). Although enterococci are normally of relatively low virulence, they can transfer their antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors to other intestinal microflora and/or virulent bacteria, resulting in an increased pathogenicity (5).",

The presence of large numbers of enterococci, in particular multidrug resistant ones, occurs commonly in vegetables, dairy and animal products (7). This dilemma, in part, is because of extensive usage of antimicrobial agents in modern farm industry (8). Due to limited therapeutic options for treating vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), they are considered as a major cause of concern. VRE has been isolated from hospital sources, food animals, environment, and waste water. Previously, we investigated more about VRE from clinical samples, surface water and sewage treatment plants in Iran. The results of our prior studies showed isolation of a high number of VRE isolates from water and sewage (9, 10).",

Preparation and inoculation of the plates were according to the manufacturer instruction. Briefly, a loopful of a fresh bacterial culture was inoculated in PhPlate growth media containing 0.2% (w/v) protease peptone, 0.05% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl and 0.011% (w/v) bromothymol blue.

Furthermore, high-level glycopeptide-resistant VanA-type strains from supermarket-purchased chicken were detected in England (15). On the other hand, absence of VRE from meats was reported in studies performed in the US (16,17) which reflected the absence of VRE isolation in animal food product. Elimination of VRE, in part, may have been resulted during the food processing. On the contrary, in European countries, VRE have been frequently isolated from meat products, which might be due to the usage of glycopeptides avoparcin antibiotic in food animal production environments before banning this antibiotic (18,19).

In contrast, in a study by Giraffa and Sisto, there was no evidence of VRE in dairy products (20). However, some years later, Giraffa and colleagues in Italy found that 50% of the cheeses examined were contaminated by VRE (7). E. faecium was the only species isolated in all the samples in our study, while in most of the studies E. faecium and E. faecalis were simultaneously isolated from food samples. Klein et al. reported a total of 34 VRE strains isolated from raw minced beef and pork and 38% of VRE isolates were identified as E. faecium, 35% were E. faecalis, and the remaining isolates were from the E. faecium group (21). Moreover, similar results were detected in the UK in fresh and frozen chicken, 58% and 40% of which were E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively (15).",

This has been confirmed by other studies which have found the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in farm animals and their meat to be higher than 60% (22,23). These studies showed that extensive agricultural use of glycopeptides or other antibiotics has created animal reservoir of resistant enterococcal species to antibiotics which has complicated the control of infections caused by enterococci. Here we determined that resistance to gentamicin was very high among the animal products (95%). Using the synergism between aminoglycosides and B-lactams or glycopeptides eliminated owing to high-level aminoglycoside resistance, which is of vast clinical importance (24). Peters and colleagues have reported a very low gentamicin resistance in food from animal origin in Germany (25). The difference in the reported antibiotic resistance among animal products could be due to geographical differences and the policy as well as production practices performed in these countries.",

The reason for the absence of resistance to tetracycline in this study may be due to the fact that tetracycline is not used as a therapeutic antimicrobial in veterinary medicine in Iran. In consistent with another study, here we reported that the prevalence of chloramphenicol resistance was very low among E. faecium strains (26).We found no resistant isolate to oxazolidinone, linezolid and Q-D in this study (25). Although surveillance of enterococci from food sources for resistance to linezolid has not been reported extensively (26), there are some resistance reports to Q-D in the USA, given the use of the analogue virginiamycin since 1974 (27,28).",

The level of antibiotics in animal product, in turn, may be due to treatment regimens used for infections in animals. Controlled use of antibiotics in animal husbandry is highly suggestive in Iran.",
