            "text": "Objective: To quantify the effects of cognitive training (CT) on cognitive and behavioral outcome measures in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Methods: We systematically searched 5 databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CT in patients with PD reporting cognitive or behavioral outcomes. Efficacy was measured as standardized mean difference (Hedges g) of post-training change. Results: Seven studies encompassing 272 patients with Hoehn & Yahr Stages 1-3 were included. The overall effect of CT over and above control conditions was small but statistically significant (7 studies: g 5 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.014-0.44, p 5 0.037). True heterogeneity across studies was low (I 2 5 0%) and there was no evidence of publication bias. Larger effect sizes were noted on working memory (4 studies: g 5 0.74, CI 0.32-1.17, p 5 0.001), processing speed (4 studies: g 5 0.31, CI 0.01-0.61, p 5 0.04), and executive function (5 studies: g 5 0.30, CI 0.01-0.58, p 5 0.042), while effects on measures of global cognition (4 studies), memory (5 studies), visuospatial skills (4 studies), and depression (5 studies), as well as attention, quality of life, and instrumental activities of daily living (3 studies each), were not statistically significant. No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Though still small, the current body of RCT evidence indicates that CT is safe and modestly effective on cognition in patients with mild to moderate PD. Larger RCTs are necessary to examine the utility of CT for secondary prevention of cognitive decline in this population."

            "text": "Cognitive impairment is increasingly recognized as an important nonmotor symptom of Parkinson disease (PD). 1 Neuropsychological impairments in PD are common, with the majority of patients showing at least some evidence of cognitive decline, while many progress to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 2 or dementia. 3 These changes have a significant impact on quality of life in patients, as well as increasing caregiver burden and health care costs. Therefore, investigating potential methods of cognitive restoration is vital. 4 Medications have been shown to have only limited benefit in the treatment of cognitive impairment in PD 5 and nonpharmacologic interventions are of interest because the majority of patients with advanced PD are already burdened by complex polypharmacy. Cognitive training (CT) is one such option, which involves structured and theoretically driven teaching of strategies or guided practice on tasks that target particular cognitive domains. 6 A recent metaanalysis has shown that computerized CT is efficacious on cognition in healthy older adults when supervised, 7 and a systematic review found evidence for efficacy in MCI. 8 Reviews of CT in PD have been reported previously. [9][10][11] However, the literature has grown considerably since their publication, and meta-analytic techniques had not been previously employed. Furthermore, these reviews were not restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and combined results from CT studies with other cognitive interventions. Therefore, this study aims to quantitatively and systematically examine whether RCTs of strictly defined CT can improve cognitive and psychosocial outcomes in patients with PD.",

We considered studies that lacked assessor blinding or did not adhere to intention-to-treat analysis (i.e., those with high risk for incomplete outcome data 14 ) as having high risk of bias. In addition, we used an adapted version of the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro-P) Rating Scale 15 to assess the methodologic quality of the individual studies. The original PEDro scale consists of 11 items; however, 2 of the scale's items that assessed blinding of therapists and patients were not considered due to impracticality in CT trials, and so the maximum possible PEDro score was set at 9. The assessment of each article was conducted by multiple independent reviewers (I.H.K.L., C.C.W., and H.H.). Disagreements were solved by a senior reviewer (A.L.).

Eighty-one outcomes were used to generate effect sizes. Mean age across samples ranged from 59.8 to 69.1 years. Approximately 57% of patients were male. Participants' disease severity ranged between Hoehn & Yahr Stages 1 and 3. Five studies were conducted in Europe, 20,[22][23][24]27 1 in the United States, 21 and 1 in Brazil. 25 Five of the studies compared CT to an active control intervention (for description of individual studies, see table 1). The average PEDro score was 6.57/9 (SD 1.18). Six of the 7 studies were found to have a high risk of bias due to lack of adherence to intention-to-treat analysis, and lack of assessor blinding was noted in 2 studies 21,27 (table e-2).",

Interestingly, improvements in executive functions were not shown in a recent metaanalysis in healthy older adults, 7 possibly because deterioration in these domains is less pronounced in normal cognitive aging than in PD. Processing speed is another cognitive domain that is vitally important for everyday functioning, and typically shows declines in PD. 32 Effects in this domain are consistent with those found in healthy elderly. 7 Memory did not demonstrate any statistically significant effect. Similarly, lack of effect on visuospatial skills, a key domain of PD-related cognitive deficits 33 that responds well to CT in healthy older adults, 7 warrants development of new CT exercises that target these domains. An analysis of depression yielded a negligible effect size after one outlier study was removed. However, depression scores in the samples were low; for example, the average Geriatric Depression Scale-15 score of the CT in the 2 studies that reported this outcome 22,23 was 2.33 (SD 1.51), while the average Beck Depression Inventory-II score was 8.90 (SD 3.1) in 2 other studies 20,24 ; neither indicates depressive symptoms in the cohorts and thus a ceiling effect is likely.",

            "text": "The findings of the current meta-analysis are of particular interest given the lack of efficacy illustrated in pharmacologic treatments for cognitive decline in PD. An extensive evidence-based medical review of the area in 2011 5 showed that with the possible exception of rivastigmine there is insufficient evidence for pharmacologic therapy for dementia in PD. Thus, given its efficacy, safety, and relatively low cost, implementation of CT should be pushed forward as a pragmatic approach for maintaining cognition in PD. 4 The current body of evidence is thus compelling and warrants further studies aiming at establishing standards for CT in PD populations and clinical implementation. To achieve this goal, future studies will need to ensure adherence to the highest RCT standards, as several recent studies were excluded for non-RCT criteria (e.g., references 34-36), and while RCTs in this review reported relatively low attrition rates (all # 15%), intention-to-treat analyses were not performed in 6 studies, thereby potentially inflating the results to some extent. Not least important is to ensure assessor blinding, mask interventions as much as possible by using active control groups or head-to-head comparisons of different CT interventions, and include large enough sample sizes to sufficiently power studies to detect effects on key clinical outcomes. Indeed, the typical trial in this review was modest in size (median n 5 39), while the sample size needed to provide 80% power at the 0.05 level for an anticipated effect size of g 5 0.23 is approximately 129, allowing for 15% attrition rate. Given objective difficulties recruiting and working with a PD population on a consistent basis as required for CT, the field might benefit from the inception of large, multicenter trials.",

Similarly, we could not perform subgroup analyses that could indicate the relative efficacy of intervention design elements, due to the small number of studies as well as the lack of true heterogeneity (i.e., I 2 5 0%) in overall cognitive results. Further, neuropsychological classification into independent domains cannot accurately reflect the complex nature of these tasks, which often tap into multiple areas of cognition. Replication of this metaanalysis in the future will be crucial once further studies have been completed."
