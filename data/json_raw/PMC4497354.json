            "text": "Several exocrine drainage procedures have been successfully developed to perform pancreas transplantation (PT). Retroperitoneal graft placement allows exocrine drainage via direct duodenoduodenostomy (DD). This technique provides easy access for endoscopic surveillance and biopsy. A total of 241 PT procedures were performed in our centre between 2002 and 2012. DD was performed in 125 patients, and duodenojejunostomy (DJ) in 116 patients. We retrospectively compared our experience with these two types of enteric drainage, focusing on graft and patient survivals, as well as postoperative complications. With a mean followup of 59 months, both groups demonstrated comparable patient and graft survivals. 14 (11%) of 125 cases in the DD group and 21 (18%) of 116 cases in the DJ group had pancreatic graft loss (P = 0.142). Graft thrombosis [5 (4%) vs. 18 (16%) P = 0.002], anastomotic insufficiency [2 (1.6%) vs. 8 (7%) P = 0.052] and relaparotomy [52 (41%) vs. 56 (48%) P = 0.29] occurred more frequently in the DJ group, whereas gastrointestinal bleeding [14 (11%) vs. 4 (3%) P = 0.026] occurred more often in the DD group. DD is a feasible and safe technique in PT, with no increase in enteric complications. It is equivalent to other established techniques and extends the feasibility of anastomotic sites, especially in recipients who have undergone a second transplantation.",

            "text": "Pancreas transplantation (PT) has undergone remarkable development since its first implementation in 1966. It has become an accepted therapeutic option for diabetes mellitus owing to improvements in the procedure, progress behind organ conservation and intensive care medicine, and the increase in the availability of improved immunosuppressants [1]. Regarding surgical techniques, the bladder drainage method favoured until the mid-1990s has been increasingly replaced worldwide by enteric drainage [2]. Enteric drainage of the pancreas graft is considered the current standard method in PT; hence, in 2010, more than 90% of the patients with simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation were treated with enteric drainage [2]. The most common method of enteric drainage is performing an anastomosis between the donor duodenum and the recipient jejunum, with the pancreas graft in an intraperitoneal position. This particular method has been modified in recent years.",

Exploration in the mesenteric root area of the superior mesenteric vein follows to assess the feasibility of anastomosis. In case of a small calibre mesenteric vein or distinct mesenteric root steatosis, venous anastomosis is created alternatively to the inferior caval vein. The pancreas is inserted vertically with the head upright. The arterial anastomosis is then created end-to-side between the donor's Y-iliac graft and the recipient's right CIA. After sufficient mobilization of the recipient duodenum, both duodena are approximated side-to-side, roughly at the level between the second and third portions of the recipient's duodenum. The external suture line is then applied to the posterior wall using 4-0 polydioxanone in a running suture style. Subsequently, a 2.5-to 3-cm longitudinal incision of both duodena is made (Fig. 1a). The inner layer is performed with a full-thickness running suture using 4-0 nonabsorbable polypropylene in consequence of the highly vascularized duodenum. Finally, the second external running suture line of the anterior wall is applied, again using 4-0 polydioxanone (Fig. 1b). The mobilized right colon is returned to its native position, thus completely covering the pancreas and making it a retroperitoneal organ. We do not routinely perform appendectomy. After reperfusion of the pancreatic graft and completion of the enteric anastomosis in cases of combined pancreas-kidney transplantation, the kidney transplantation is performed with arterial and venous anastomosis to the recipient's left-sided pelvic vessels. Finally, two Jackson-Pratt drains are inserted routinely. One drain is placed in a retroperitoneal position beside the pancreas graft, ending behind the DD.

The drainage of exocrine secretions into the urinary bladder dominated the 1980s and 1990s. This technique allows immunological monitoring of the graft through the determination of pan-creatic enzymes in the urine or via cystoscopic biopsy [13,14]. In most centres today, bladder drainage is no longer used because of significant urological problems, reflux pancreatitis and potentially considerable bicarbonate loss. Bladder drainage has been increasingly replaced by enteric drainage; the proportion of patients undergoing PT with enteric drainage currently accounts for approximately 91% in the SPK transplantation group, 89% in the PAK transplantation group and 85% in the PTA group as per transplantation procedure [1]. Enteric drainage PT is usually performed as proximal DJ with or without Roux-en-Y limb [11]. Furthermore, exocrine drainage into the distal ileum [15] and gastric-exocrine drainage [9,10] were reported. DD emerges as another option for enteric drainage if the pancreas graft is placed in the right retroperitoneal space. DD in PT has already been described in single case reports and case series [4][5][6][7][8], all of them having in common a small number of patients.",

            "text": "The objective of this study was to describe our experience with 125 DD cases in PT to assess the comparative advantages or disadvantages between this technique and DJ. The study focused on cases in which pancreatic graft loss resulted in a duodenal leak that required treatment. This complication requires sophisticated surgical treatment and is the focal point of arguments from opponents of DD, thus spurring a controversy in the field. Compared with the results from high-volume centres in the United States [16,17] and summarized data from the International Pancreas Transplant Registry [2], similarly good 1-and 5-year patient and graft survival rates could be achieved. In comparison with the US data, the complication rate (graft thrombosis, bleeding, rejection and relaparotomy rates) was slightly higher in this study. However, it must be noted that our recipient and donor groups had a significantly older age and that the donors exhibited a high proportion of death by cerebrovascular causes (>70%). In our opinion, the main reason for the relatively high rejection rate is a result of including the borderline rejections. For the overall collective of the study, there are at least 24 cases; that means exactly onethird of all reported rejections. If the borderline rejections are not included and rejection is defined as starting from stage BANFF I, as many authors do, there is a 1-year rejection rate of 18.4% (23/125) for the DD group and 21.5% (25/116) for the DJ group, respectively. Complications such as graft pancreatitis, intra-abdominal infections and required relaparotomies, which occurred more often in our patients, frequently necessitate a reduction in immunosuppressive therapy. It is also conceivable that the increased rejection rate could be due to this fact. After having analysed our data in 2009, we already noticed the increased rejection rates. For this reason and based on our positive experience with a repeated thymoglobulin dose in kidney transplantation within the Eurotransplant Senior Program, we extended the induction therapy in SPK from a single-shot therapy with 1.5 mg/kg/BW to two further postoperative administrations. The hospital stay of our patients is relatively long in relation to international standards, especially in the US. In our institution, we still have the opportunity to implement part of the rehabilitation during patients' initial admission, which results in a longer hospitalization period. The inpatients' stay is reported as a mean of 42 days in both groups. However, this value is distinctly inflated by 'long-stay patients' with a complicated recovery period. The median inpatient stay is 33 days in the DD group and 34 days in the DJ group. This value of inpatient hospitalization following pancreas transplantation can be found in most of the German transplantation centres.",

[3], applying retroperitoneal placement of pancreas grafts, the first DD cases in our centre were performed in patients with retransplantations or previous abdominal operations presenting distinct interenteric adhesion. Owing to the close anatomical location of both duodena, placement of a DD was the easiest and safest solution. Increasing experience with this technique and comparative results with DJ have established this surgical method as standard practice in our centre since 2007. The 1 (DD, 82% vs. DJ, 78%)-and 5-year pancreas graft survival rates (DD, 82% vs. DJ, 73%) were slightly better in the DD group, although this difference was not statistically significant (log-rank test, P = 0.202). This is interesting because the patients in the DD group were on average older, showed longer diabetes and dialysis durations and had higher BMI compared with the DJ group. In addition, most of their organs were perfused with HTK Custodiol. All these factors are well known for their negative impact on the results of PT [18][19][20][21][22][23].",
