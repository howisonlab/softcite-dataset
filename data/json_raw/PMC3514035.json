Although there are variations among different epithelia, junction formation is generally induced by filopodia or lamellipodia initiating cell-cell contact followed by junction formation and maturation, leading to the establishment of mature tight and adherens junctions (Vasioukhin et al., 2000;Matter and Balda, 2003b;Miyoshi and Takai, 2008;Nelson, 2009). Actin remodeling underlies these morphological transitions and needs to be carefully controlled to allow the coordinated assembly of a functional apical junctional complex (Vasioukhin et al., 2000;Redd et al., 2004;Chhabra and Higgs, 2007).",

            "text": "RhoGTPases are central regulatory switches that guide actin organization, junction formation, and epithelial differentiation (Braga and Yap, 2005;Jaffe and Hall, 2005;Ridley, 2006). They are regulated by factors that catalyze the switch between the active, GTP-bound state, and the inactive, GDP-bound state: activation is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and inactivation by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs; Bos et al., 2007). The RhoGTPase Cdc42 is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of cell polarization and regulates different steps of junction formation from filopodial extension to junctional maturation; hence, mechanisms must exist that activate and inactivate Cdc42 in a temporally controlled manner at specific subcellular sites to permit progression of dynamic morphological processes (Matter and Balda, 2003b;Iden and Collard, 2008). Although activation of Cdc42 is generally seen as the critical step, expression of dominant-negative and constitutively active mutants of Cdc42 revealed that inhibition as well as overstimulation of Cdc42 signaling prevents normal junction formation and differentiation (Kroschewski et al., 1999;Rojas et al., 2001;Bruewer et al., 2004). Hence, negative regulation of Cdc42 is important for the successful completion of complex sequential Cdc42-driven processes. This is supported by E pithelial cell-cell adhesion and morphogenesis require dynamic control of actin-driven membrane remodeling. The Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Cdc42 regulates sequential molecular processes during cell-cell junction formation; hence, mechanisms must exist that inactivate Cdc42 in a temporally and spatially controlled manner. In this paper, we identify SH3BP1, a GTPase-activating protein for Cdc42 and Rac, as a regulator of junction assembly and epithelial morphogenesis using a functional small interfering ribonucleic acid screen. Depletion of SH3BP1 resulted in loss of spatial control of Cdc42 activity, stalled membrane remodeling, and enhanced growth of filopodia. SH3BP1 formed a complex with JACOP/paracingulin, a junctional adaptor, and CD2AP, a scaffolding protein; both were required for normal Cdc42 signaling and junction formation. The filamentous actincapping protein CapZ also associated with the SH3BP1 complex and was required for control of actin remodeling. Epithelial junction formation and morphogenesis thus require a dual activity complex, containing SH3BP1 and CapZ, that is recruited to sites of active membrane remodeling to guide Cdc42 signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics. and then analyzed by immunoblotting (A) and immunofluorescence (B). Shown are epifluorescence images. (C) Caco-2 cells were transfected with myctagged Cdc42L61, a constitutively active mutant, and then stained for ZO-1 and the transfected protein. (D) Summary of RhoGTPases and GAPs identified in the functional siRNA screen (see also Table S1). (E-L) Caco-2 cells were transfected with siRNAs as indicated and then analyzed by immunofluorescence (E and G-L) or immunoblotting (F). Apart from F-actin, shown are images of markers for tight junctions (E and G), adherens junctions (H), and basolateral and apical cell surface domains (K). Shown are epifluorescence (D and F-K) and confocal (L, xy and z sections are provided) images. For F-actin, apical and basal focal planes are shown. Panel I shows a quantification of the effect on the subcellular distribution of F-actin (counting cells with strongly induced basal F-actin; mean basal actin intensity increased by >60% in SH3BP1-depleted cells) and three junctional markers (counting cells with discontinuous, irregular junctional staining). Shown are means \u00b1 1 SD, representing the cells in at least five different fields per condition (n \u2265 5). Note that assembly of tight and adherens junctions is affected, but different components are affected to different extents. (M-O) Complementation of SH3BP1 siRNA transfection with a siRNA-resistant cDNA. Caco-2 cells were first transfected with siRNAs as indicated and then, after 3 d, with a plasmid carrying the siRNA-resistant cDNA. Cells were then analyzed by immunoblotting (M) or immunofluorescence (N). Panel O shows a quantification of the ZO-1 staining (six fields for each condition).

However, Rich1 is thought to regulate polarization once junctions are assembled, as it is not required for membrane dynamics and adherens junction assembly. Whether specific GAPs are required for junction assembly and are important to maintain actin dynamics and membrane remodeling is not known. Moreover, it is likely that GTPase regulation is tightly connected to other regulators of actin dynamics; however, little is known about specific molecular cross talk that would mediate such cooperative regulatory mechanisms.",

SH3BP1 is a GAP for Rac and Cdc42 (Cicchetti et al., 1995;Parrini et al., 2011), and our data show that its depletion leads to spatial and temporal deregulation of Cdc42 and, depending on the cell model, a modest effect on Rac activation. SH3BP1 forms a complex with two scaffolding proteins and the F-actin-capping protein CapZ, suggesting that this regulatory complex represents a dual activity module that links regulation of Cdc42 and actin dynamics during membrane remodeling and junction formation.",

The siRNA-mediated depletion of Cdc42 was efficient and led to flatter cells with a disrupted distribution of ZO-1, a tight junction protein, and \ue062-catenin, a component of adherens junctions as well as reduced and disorganized expression of the apical marker DPPIV and the basolateral protein Na + K + -ATPase (Fig. 1, A and B). Similarly, overexpression of constitutively active Cdc42, myc-Cdc42L61, disrupted the normal organization of cell junctions and the actin cytoskeleton in Caco-2 as well as in the epidermal carcinoma cell line A431 ( Fig. 1 C and Fig. S1 A). Hence, inhibition as well as overstimulation of Cdc42 interferes with normal epithelial junction formation and differentiation as previously observed in other epithelial cell systems (Kroschewski et al., 1999;Rojas et al., 2001;Bruewer et al., 2004).",

Regulation of RhoA is crucial during epithelial junction formation (Terry et al., 2011), and both identified RhoA GAPs MYO9A (Abouhamed et al., 2009;Omelchenko and Hall, 2012) and OPHN1 ( Fig. S1, C-E) localize to the junctional complex. OPHN1 has also GAP activity for Rac and Cdc42 in vitro; however, its main function in vivo seems to be regulation of RhoA (Billuart et al., 1998;Khelfaoui et al., 2009).",

Subsequent analysis in Caco-2 cells using different siRNAs resulted in monolayers that failed to assemble a normal junctional actin belt and exhibited a strong induction of basal F-actin, often in an astral shape along cell borders (Fig. 1, E and F). Similar patterns of disorganized actin were observed when cells were stained with \ue062-actin antibodies instead of phalloidin ( Fig. S2 A). Tight and adherens junctions were also affected, as markers such as ZO-1, cingulin, E-cadherin, and p120 catenin exhibited enhanced cytoplasmic staining and were less concentrated along cell-cell contacts (Fig. 1, G-I). Cells also failed to differentiate normally, as the distributions of DPPIV and Na + K + -ATPase were disrupted, although expression levels were not affected (Fig. 1 K and Fig. S2 B). Depleted cells remained flat and did not form columnar cells with distinct tight and adherens junctions and, hence, were less densely packed (Fig. 1 L). Similarly, in SH3BP1-depleted human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells, a squamous epithelial cell type, ZO-1, did not form a continuous junctional belt, and the adherens junction marker \ue062-catenin accumulated in filopodia-like structures (Fig. S2 C). In the epidermal carcinoma cell line A431, depletion also triggered a reorganization of F-actin, resulting in accumulation of filopodia ( Fig. S2 D). SH3BP1 is thus required for normal junction formation in epithelial cell models originating from different tissues and representing different types of epithelia. The accumulation of filopodia suggests that depletion may lead to deregulation of Cdc42.",

Time-lapse microscopy with cells expressing GFP-actin further indicated that depletion of SH3BP1 strongly attenuated EGF-induced actin remodeling. Whereas control siRNA-transfected cells formed extensive and dynamic dorsal ruffles that exhibited the same morphology as in fixed cells, SH3BP1-depleted cells showed little signs of actin dynamics apart from the slow growth of filopodia (Fig. 6 B and Videos 1,2,3,and 4).",

Fig. 8 A shows that 20-and 30-nM Cdc42-specific siRNAs led to a partial depletion of the GTPase; depletion of the GAP was not affected by the cotransfection of different siRNAs. Partial depletion of Cdc42 already interfered with normal junctional assembly but, as expected, not as efficiently as at optimal siRNA concentrations (Fig. 8, B and C). In SH3BP1-depleted cells, partial Cdc42 depletion counteracted the phenotype, and cells formed more regular monolayers with assembled junctions, indicating that Cdc42 is a major functional target of SH3BP1. These data thus indicate that SH3BP1 is an important regulator of epithelial Cdc42 signaling by controlling the spatial organization of the active RhoGTPase, which is supported by the accumulation of SH3BP1 in areas enriched in active Cdc42 during EGF-and calcium-induced junction assembly (Fig. S4, G and H).",

            "text": "We next asked whether junctional signaling scaffolds are important for SH3BP1 localization and function. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that SH3BP1 formed complexes with JACOP/paracingulin, a junctional protein known to affect RhoGTPase signaling, and CD2AP, a scaffolding protein implicated in actin remodeling, in Caco-2 and A431 cells (Fig. 8, A and B; Ohnishi et al., 2004;Bruck et al., 2006;Guillemot et al., 2008;van Duijn et al., 2010;Roldan et al., 2011). JACOP antibodies coprecipitated not only the GAP but also CD2AP, suggesting that the three proteins may exist in a triple complex. Coprecipitation of JACOP with other proteins was not detected, possibly reflecting the low signal obtained in immunoblots of total cell extracts. Coprecipitation of SH3BP1 with several other major components of tight and adherens junctions was not observed (Fig. S5, A and B). Nevertheless, there was coprecipitation of afadin/AF-6, a protein that associates with nectins (Takai et al., 2008), in Caco-2 but not A431 cells, suggesting that SH3BP1 and afadin do not exist in stable complexes in all epithelial cells (Fig. S5 C). SH3BP1, JACOP, and CD2AP not only form a stable complex but were also found to colocalize at established and forming cell junctions (Fig. 9, C and D) and in EGF-induced dorsal ruffles (Fig. 9 E). Complex formation did not require EGF stimulation (Fig. S5 D), and recruitment of JACOP and CD2AP to cell junctions was, like SH3BP1, attenuated when the EGF receptor was inhibited (Fig. 9 F). Expression levels of the GAP were affected by depletion of JACOP and CD2AP, suggesting that complex formation may be important for stabilization of SH3BP1 (Fig. S5 E). Complex formation was further supported by the enhanced recruitment of CD2AP and SH3BP1 to cell junctions upon overexpression of JACOP (Fig. S5 F).",

In control A431 cells, higher mean FRET activities were measured along the apical surface than along the base of the cells (Fig. 7, B and C).

In serum-starved A431 cells, staining intensity was low, reflecting the low levels of active Cdc42 and indicating that the antibody background was low ( Fig. S4 C and Fig. 7 A, Cdc42 levels). Stimulation with EGF resulted in staining of dorsal ruffles within 5 min, in agreement with the previously reported quick and sustained accumulation of active Cdc42 in ruffles (Kurokawa et al., 2004;Kovacs et al., 2006;King et al., 2011). Active Rac1 also increased in response to EGF and was more prominent along the dorsal aspects of the cells; however, it did not accumulate in the large ruffles as active Cdc42 (Fig. S4 D). This is also in agreement with the biosensor experiments by Kurokawa et al. (2004), demonstrating that Rac is transiently activated during ruffle initiation in A431 cells (Kovacs et al., 2006;King et al., 2011). Hence, the results obtained with these antibodies are in agreement with previous work on Rac and Cdc42 activation in the same model system.",

Analysis of the spatial distribution of Cdc42 activity supported the importance of SH3BP1 in the regulation of RhoGTPase signaling, as active Cdc42 was enriched apically in control cells but preferentially basal and reduced along cell-cell contacts in depleted cells (Fig. 7, E and F). Staining with the antibodies recognizing active Cdc42 led to the same conclusion, as the staining was enriched at junctions in control cells and dispersed in depleted cells (Fig. 7, G and H; and Fig. S4 F, Cdc42 siRNA control). Lateral or Figure 7. Spatial regulation of Cdc42 activity by SH3BP1. (A) Levels of active Cdc42 and Rac1 were measured after serum starvation and stimulation with EGF in total cell extracts after transfection of either control or SH3BP1-targeting siRNAs. Shown are means \u00b1 1 SD (n = 3). (B and C) A431 cells were first transfected with siRNAs and then with a biosensor to measure Cdc42 activity. The cells were then serum starved before stimulating for 10 min with EGF. FRET efficiency was then measured by confocal microscopy. Shown are apical and basal sections. A FRET efficiency scale is shown for the color coding (high FRET efficiency reflects high Cdc42 activity). B shows a quantification of the FRET images, using apical sections to compare internal and cell-cell contact signals and ratios of apical versus basal mean FRET signals. Shown are means of different fields \u00b1 1 SD (n = 11). (D) HA-tagged SH3BP1 constructs encoding the wild-type or a GAP-deficient mutant (R312A) were transfected, and effects on F-actin and \ue062-catenin were analyzed by immunofluorescence and epifluorescence microscopy. (E and F) Caco-2 cells were first transfected with siRNAs and then with the Cdc42 biosensor. FRET efficiency was then measured by confocal microscopy. Shown are apical and basal sections. FRET images were quantified as in C. Shown are means of different fields \u00b1 1 SD (n = 12). (G and H) Caco-2 cells were transfected with siRNAs and then analyzed by immunofluorescence using antibodies against GTP-bound Cdc42 and ZO-1. H shows a quantification of the number of cells with a defined lateral Cdc42 staining as opposed to the diffuse lateral staining observed in SH3BP1depleted cells. Shown are means \u00b1 1 SD from six different fields (n = 6). Bars, 10 \u00b5m.",

Recombinant full-length SH3BP1 as well as a fusion protein containing the C-terminal domain, which includes the SH3-binding domain, pulled down CD2AP (Fig. 9 G). JACOP was only pulled down by the N-terminal domain, suggesting that the recombinant full-length protein might be in a confirmation that does not allow efficient binding. These binding experiments suggest that SH3BP1 might serve as a bridge, linking JACOP to CD2AP. Indeed, coprecipitation of CD2AP with JACOP required SH3BP1, whereas depletion of CD2AP did not affect the coprecipitation efficiency of SH3BP1 with JACOP ( Fig. 9 H). The N-terminal domain of SH3BP1 has recently been shown to associate with the exocyst in cells overexpressing the GAP (Parrini et al., 2011); however, we could not detect specific coprecipitation of endogenous proteins.",

Therefore, we asked whether the SH3BP1-JACOP-paracingulin complex contains two actin-modulating activities: a Rho GAP and an F-actin-capping activity. Indeed, CapZ\ue0611 was detected in precipitates of SH3BP1 and the two scaffolding proteins (Fig. 9 B). CapZ\ue0611 was recruited to dorsal ruffles along with SH3BP1 in EGF-stimulated A431 cells but remained diffusely distributed in SH3BP1-depleted cells (Fig. 10 E). CapZ\ue0611 depletion indeed disrupted formation of a junctional actin belt and induced filopodia (Fig. 10, F and G). Thus, the identified SH3BP1 complex contains two activities that regulate the actin cytoskeleton: a GAP and a capping activity.",

This is supported by results with dominant-negative and constitutively active Cdc42 that Figure 8. Cdc42 is a functionally important target of SH3BP1. Caco-2 cells were transfected with control, SH3BP1-, and Cdc42-specific siRNAs. For Cdc42, two different suboptimal concentrations, 20 and 30 nM, were used. (A and B) Depletion of SH3BP1 and Cdc42 was then analyzed by immunoblotting (A), and the effect on cell morphology and junction assembly was analyzed by immunofluorescence (B). (C) The effect on the ZO-1 distribution was then quantified as in Fig. 1 C. Shown are means \u00b1 1 SD from three independent experiments (n = 3). The indicated p-values for double knockdown data are for comparisons with single SH3BP1 and Cdc42 depletions. Figure 9. SH3BP1 forms a complex with CD2AP and the junctional scaffold JACOP.

An IgG control from the same species as each of the specific primary antibodies is shown. The JACOP antibody recognized only a weak band in total cell extracts, and coprecipitation of this protein could not be detected.

Similarly, depletion of the GAP corrected the phenotype caused by partial Cdc42 depletion; hence, Cdc42 seems to be the main substrate of SH3BP1 during epithelial junction formation.

This sequential process requires continuous membrane remodeling driven by the actin cytoskeleton. RhoGTPases play essential roles in these processes, and proper regulation of RhoGTPases is required for successful junction assembly (Braga and Yap, 2005). Our data now show that SH3BP1 is a crucial negative regulator of RhoGTPase and, in particular, Cdc42 signaling, which is required for normal junction assembly and differentiation of epithelial cells from different tissues, and indicate that SH3BP1 is required for the morphological transition from early, immature cell-cell contacts to continuous cell-cell junctions.",

The Cdc42 GAP Rich1 associates with tight junctions via the Par3-6 complex and regulates apical polarization, not junction assembly (Wells et al., 2006). Thus, epithelial junctions recruit GAPs for Cdc42 with fundamentally different roles: SH3BP1 is recruited early during junction formation and regulates junction assembly, whereas Rich1 regulates polarization once junctions are assembled. Accordingly, we could not detect a defect in junction assembly upon transfection of Rich1-targeting siRNAs in the screen that has led to the identification of SH3BP1 (Table S1).",

Although keratinocytes use filopodia, the kidney epithelial cell line MDCK relies on lamellipodia (Vasioukhin et al., 2000;Ehrlich et al., 2002). As filopodia are induced by Cdc42, whereas lamellipodia require Rac, different GTPases can initiate cell-cell contacts and, as they can both regulate polarity complexes, lead to successful epithelial differentiation (Matter and Balda, 2003b;Nelson, 2009). SH3BP1 was originally identified as a GAP with similar activities toward Cdc42 and Rac1 in vitro (Cicchetti et al., 1995). This was recently confirmed using cell-based biosensor assays (Parrini et al., 2011). The latter paper also demonstrated that SH3BP1 regulates Rac at the front of migrating cells (Parrini et al., 2011). Together with our data, this indicates that SH3BP1 can stimulate GTP hydrolysis by both Rac and Cdc42 in vitro and in vivo and that the activities toward both GTPases are relevant for specific biological processes. Moreover, it could be that SH3BP1 regulates junction formation not only in epithelia that rely on filopodia but also in those that use lamellipodia.",

Although during migration, SH3BP1 is targeted to the front of the cells and regulates Rac, which is active at the leading edge, it is targeted to cell-cell contacts during junction formation and regulates Cdc42, which is active at cell junctions. Similarly, in dorsal ruffles, SH3BP1 strongly affects Cdc42 and, to a lesser extent, Rac1; both GTPases are stimulated during dorsal ruffle formation. Targeting to subcellular sites that are enriched in the active form of either Cdc42 or Rac thus seems to be a major determinant of the GTPase selectivity of the GAP, and its activity seems to prevent the diffusion of active GTPase away from specific sites. Complex formation seems to play a fundamental role for junctional targeting of SH3BP1 and its function, as depletion of JACOP and, to lesser extent, CD2AP resulted in loss of junctional SH3BP1, deregulation of Cdc42, and inhibition of junction formation.",

Depletion of JACOP had a strong effect on the junctional recruitment of SH3BP1 and CD2AP and led to a strong reduction in Cdc42 activity, indicating that it is important for recruitment of the complex and the control of the GAP activity of SH3BP1. In MDCK cells, JACOP has been linked to the regulation of Rac and RhoA via two different GEFs (Guillemot et al., 2008); however, this is the first study that links JACOP to the regulation of a GAP and of Cdc42.",

CD2AP is a regulator of actin dynamics and binds to the barbed-end binding protein CapZ (Mejillano et al., 2004;Bruck et al., 2006). CapZ is also part of the SH3BP1 complex, and its depletion induces filopodia, as has previously been demonstrated by genetic ablation (Mejillano et al., 2004). CD2AP and CapZ thus provide the SH3BP1 complex with a second cellular activity that can guide actin reorganization and membrane remodeling. Given the link of CD2AP to renal disease, it will be important to determine whether and how SH3BP1 and JACOP contribute to normal renal physiology and, if deregulated, play a role in disease development. Because of its association with CapZ, we propose that the SH3BP1 complex represents a dual activity feedback complex required for the coordination of actin-driven morphological processes that is recruited to sites of active membrane remodeling by the scaffolding components JACOP and CD2AP to terminate individual steps, enabling activation of subsequent GTPase-activated processes and junctional maturation.

For immunofluorescence staining, the sections were permeabilized with acetone/methanol (33:67) for 10 min at \ue03220\u00b0C and then transferred to methanol/DMSO (4:1) for 20 h at 4\u00b0C. The samples were then rehydrated with sequential changes of methanol decreasing from 75 to 50 and 25 to 0% in PBS at room temperature for 5-10 min each. Next, the samples were further permeabilized and blocked for 8-10 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber in BSA permeabilization buffer (3% BSA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.2% Na-dodecylsulfate, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 5% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich). The samples were then incubated with goat anti-SH3BP1 and rabbit anti-ZO-1 for 16 h at room temperature in BSA permeabilization buffer containing 5% donkey serum in a humidified chamber. Afterward, samples were washed with PBS and BSA permeabilization buffer sequentially for 10-15 min in two cycles. Incubation with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33258 in BSA permeabilization buffer was for 6 h at room temperature in BSA permeabilization buffer in a humidified chamber followed by washing with PBS and BSA permeabilization buffer for 10-15 min in two cycles and mounting with ProLong (Life Technologies). All fixed samples were embedded in ProLong Gold antifade reagent. All epifluorescent images of fixed specimens were acquired with a fluorescent microscope (DM IRB; Leica) using a 63\u00d7/1.4 NA oil immersion objective fitted with a camera (C4742-95; Hamamatsu Photonics) and simplePCI software (Hamamatsu Photonics). Confocal images were acquired with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 700; Carl Zeiss) or a confocal microscope (SP2; Leica) using 63\u00d7/1.4 NA immersion oil objectives. Immersion oil (518 F; Carl Zeiss) was used for all objectives. Images were acquired at ambient temperature using ZEN 2009 (Carl Zeiss) or LCS (Leica). Images were adjusted for brightness and contrast with Photoshop (Adobe). For FRET experiments, siRNA-transfected cells were plated into eight multiwell chamber slides (ibidi), transfected with pRaichu-Cdc42, and analyzed using a microscope (SP2; 63\u00d7/1.4 NA objective, 37\u00b0C, in medium with 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) and LCS FRET software using the donor recovery after acceptor bleaching protocol (YFP was bleached to 30%; Yoshizaki et al., 2003;Terry et al., 2011). The shown FRET efficiency maps were then generated using the LCS software by calculating the FRET efficiency according to the formal [(D post \ue032 D pre )/D post ] \u00d7 100 (D represents donor intensity). For quantification, CFP images were subtracted, and mean FRET intensities were",

To generate a mutant allele defective in GAP activity, arginine-312 was replaced by an alanine residue using the mutagenesis kit (QuikChange; Agilent Technologies). For SH3BP1 GST fusion protein constructs, the sequences encoding the indicated domains were cloned into pGEX-4T-3 (GE Healthcare) to generate SH3BP1 full-length, N-terminal domain (containing the BAR [Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs] domain), and C-terminal domain (containing the SH3-binding domain) fusion proteins. The HA-tagged JACOP cDNA was provided by M. Furuse (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan; Ohnishi et al., 2004), the HA-tagged OPHN1 was provided by P. Billuart (Institut Cochin, Paris, France;Billuart et al., 1998), and the Asef2 cDNA was obtained from D. Billadeau (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, NY;Hamann et al., 2007). The DBL isoform 1 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA-TO with an N-terminal myc tag (Komai et al., 2002). Sequences targeted in the siRNA screen are provided in Tables S2 and S3. siGENOME and ON-TARGETplus siRNAs were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. For subsequent RNAi experiments, cells were transfected with individual or pools of siGENOME siRNAs for SH3BP1, CGNL1 (JACOP), CD2AP, and CapZ\ue0611 as well as nontargeting control siRNAs (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following sequences were targeted: SH3BP1, 5\ue039-GAUGACAGCCACCCACUUC-3\ue039 and 5\ue039-UGGAGA-UUCAGGCCGAUUA-3\ue039; CGNL1, 5\ue039-GCAGGGAGCUCGCAGAAAU-3\ue039, 5\ue039-CGGAGUACCUGAUUGAAUU-3\ue039, 5\ue039-CGAGUAAAGUGCUGGAUGA-3\ue039, and 5\ue039-GGGAGAAAUACGACAGUUA-3\ue039; CD2AP, 5\ue039-GGGCGAACUU-AAUGGUAAA-3\ue039 and 5\ue039-GAGCAAAUGAAGUGUAAUA-3\ue039; CapZ\ue0611, 5\ue039-GAUGGGCAACAGACUAUUA-3\ue039, 5\ue039-UGAAAGACCAUUAUUCCAA-3\ue039, 5\ue039-CACUAACUGUUUCGAAUGA-3\ue039, and 5\ue039-UCUGUACUGUUUAUGC-UAA-3\ue039; and Cdc42, 5\ue039-CGGAAUAUGUACCGACUGU-3' and 5\ue039-GAU-GACCCCUCUACUAUUG-3\ue039. To generate a SH3BP1 cDNA resistant to siRNA2, the sequence 5\ue039-GATGACAGCCACCCACTTC-3\ue039 was changed to 5\ue039-AATGACAGCAACACACTTC-3\ue039. For siRNA transfections, transfection reagent (INTERFERin; Polyplus-transfection, Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions using a total final siRNA concentration of 20-80 nM (Terry et al., 2011). Samples were collected and processed 3-4 d after transfection.

EGF was used at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml (PeproTech), and PD153035 (Tocris Bioscience) was used for EGF inhibition. For calcium switch and permeability assays, cells were cultured in 6-well plates for the siRNA transfections and were then replated in low calcium medium containing dialyzed FBS after 24 h (Balda et al., 1996;Terry et al., 2011). Junction formation was then induced by replacing the low calcium with normal medium after another 24 h. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance was measured with a silver/silver-chloride electrode to determine the voltage quantified with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). For each image, all cell-cell contacts were quantified and as many internal areas; means of all cell-cell contacts and all internal areas in a field then gave one value each per imaged field, and these values were used for the final statistical analysis. Normalizations were performed by dividing mean values obtained for specific fields by the mean values obtained for the entire field imaged.

Samples were washed twice with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and once with PBS before adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For GST pull-down experiments, cells were extracted with the same buffer at 4\u00b0C and preadsorbed with inactive beads as described for immunoprecipitations. Extracts were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads coated with fusion proteins and incubated for 2 h at 4\u00b0C before washing as described for immunoprecipitations. For RhoGTPase activation assays, cells were transfected with the appropriate siRNAs in 12-well plates, and after 72-96 h, the protein was harvested and analyzed for levels of active Cdc42 and Rac1 using the respective G-LISA assay kits (Cytoskeleton; Terry et al., 2011).",
