            "text": "Background.-Cluster headache (CH) is a severe neurovascular disorder and an increasing amount of evidence points to a genetic contribution to this disease. When CH was first described, it was observed that alcohol may precipitate an attack during the active phase of the disease. The alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (ADH4) gene encodes an enzyme which contributes to the metabolization of alcohol and is, therefore, an interesting candidate gene for CH. Two Italian groups have reported association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1126671 located in the ADH4 gene with an increased risk of CH in Italy. In addition, one of the groups found an association between the ADH4 SNP rs1800759 and CH. Objective.-To perform a replication study on the ADH4 SNPs rs1126671 and rs1800759 in a large homogeneous Swedish case-control cohort in order to further investigate the possible contribution of ADH4 to CH. Methods.-A total of 390 unrelated patients diagnosed with CH and 389 controls representing a general Swedish population were recruited to the study. DNA samples from patients and controls were genotyped for the two ADH4 SNPs rs1126671 and rs1800759 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analyses of genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies for the two SNPs were performed and compared between patients and controls. Results.-For rs1126671, the minor allele frequency (A allele) was 32.8% (n 5 254) in controls compared with 31.9% (n 5 249) in CH patients. The minor allele frequency (A allele) of rs1800759 was 42.3% (n 5 324) in controls and 41.9% (n 5 327) in CH patients. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in allele as well as in genotype or haplotype frequencies between the patient and control group for either SNP. This was also seen after stratifying the patient group for experiencing alcohol as a trigger factor. Conclusions.-The data did not support an association of the ADH4 SNPs rs1126671 and rs1800759 with CH. A comparison with previous studies revealed variance in genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies among the different populations which might contribute to the contradictory results. Although a significant association with CH in Swedish casecontrol group was not found, ADH4 as a candidate gene for CH could not be excluded."

            "text": "Cluster headache (CH), also known as Horton's headache, is a severe neurovascular disease characterized by an intense, unilateral head pain and is generally accompanied by autonomic symptoms, such as swelling of the eye, tearing, nasal congestion, or a sense of restlessness. Attacks occur in episodic bouts, lasting weeks or months, separated by remission periods of months to years. About 10%-15% of the patients suffer from a chronic subtype where remission lasts less than 1 month/year. 1 CH has a prevalence of up to 0.1%, 2 and is three times more common in men than in women. 1 An increasing number of studies show a genetic contribution to CH, and 7%-20% of the patients have a positive family history, defined as having at least one first-, second-, or third-degree relative also diagnosed with CH. 3,4 The causes of CH and those factors that might trigger the onset of an active period are still unknown. However, already in 1941 Bayard Horton observed that alcohol may elicit an attack in CH patients during the active phase. 5 More recently, it has been reported that 52%-79% of the patients experience alcohol to trigger an attack when in a bout. [6][7][8][9] However, the study reporting a frequency of 79% included only male patients with episodic CH. 6 Among others, this observation has led to investigations on genes for CH susceptibility which are involved in alcohol metabolism. One family of enzymes with a primary role in the breakdown of alcohol is the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) family. They are predominantly expressed in the liver as well as gastrointestinal tract, 10,11 and catalyze the oxidation of alcohols, such as ethanol or retinol. There are several subunits of ADH encoded by different genes. Specifically ADH4, which is located on chromosome 4q22-23, has been implicated in a number of diseases and traits, for instance, Parkinson's disease, 12 alcohol and drug dependence, 13,14 personality traits such as extraversion and agreeableness, 15 and moreover it has been associated with CH. 16,17 The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1126671 located in exon 7 of the ADH4 gene was associated with an increased risk for CH in two Ital-ian studies, whereas rs1800759 located in the promoter region of ADH4 could only be associated with CH in the smaller case-control study. 17 The rs1126671 SNP induces an amino acid change from isoleucine to valine in the corresponding protein. It is hypothesized that this amino acid change could produce altered enzyme functionality by possibly interfering with an adjoining phosphorylation site. 16 For the ADH4 SNP rs1800759, it has been demonstrated that promoter activity in hepatoma cells is drastically increased in the mutant allele and could therefore alter ADH4 p-subunit expression. 18 In expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis using the Gtex Portal (http://www.gtexportal.org/ home/), both rs1126671 and rs1800759 have been found to have a significant correlation to the transcript levels of ADH4. In esophagus muscularis tissue, the risk alleles (A for both SNPs) were associated with higher ADH4 expression levels, while in fibroblast cells the risk alleles were associated with lower ADH4 expression levels (data sources GTEx Analysis Release V6; dbGaP Accession phs000424.v6.p1).",

Logistic regression with sex as a covariate was run in order to exclude any bias introduced by the skewed sex ratio in the patient group. We could not find a genotypic association with CH for either rs1126671 (P 5 .753) or rs1800759 (P 5 .985) when applying sex-corrected logistic regression. To take into account variability in subgroups of patients, we additionally performed a stratified analysis with respect to whether the patient regarded alcohol as a trigger factor or not (information retrieved from the questionnaire). When comparing controls with only patients that have reported alcohol to trigger an attack (n 5 196; 56.2% of patients who filled out the questionnaire), there were no significant differences in the genotypes of the two groups for either SNP (Table 3). Furthermore, we did the following observations from the patients who answered the questionnaire: 58.1% of the male (n 5 236) and 52.2% of the female (n 5 113) CH patients reported alcohol as a trigger factor. In addition, 55.7% of the episodic (n 5 309) and 60.5% of the chronic (n 5 38) CH patients experienced alcohol to elicit an attack. There were no significant differences in the proportions of male and female, or episodic and chronic, patients who reported alcohol as a trigger factor (data available upon request).

            "text": "This is the largest study on ADH4 and CH reported so far. Genotypic and allelic analyses of the investigated ADH4 polymorphisms rs1126671 and rs1800759 in CH patients suggest that there is no association between these genetic variants and CH in Sweden. The power of this study is much higher compared with previous studies where an association between ADH4 and CH has been found. 16,17 The two previously reported studies have been carried out on comparably small cohorts including only 110 and 54 CH patients, respectively. However, it is possible that population differences may lead to these varying results. Genotype and allele frequencies observed in controls from our study roughly correspond to the ones reported in the two Italian studies. Yet, for rs1800759 the mutant allele seems to be less common in the Italian cohorts (31.0%-33.7%) compared with our Swedish cohort (42.3%). From our questionnaire data, 56.2% of the patients reported that alcohol may trigger an attack which corresponds to what other groups have reported (52%-63%). [7][8][9] When performing a statistical analysis for control individuals and CH patients reporting alcohol as a trigger factor, there were no significant differences in the genotypes of the two groups for either SNP. A comparison between the haplotype analysis from one of the Italian studies 16 and our Swedish analysis emphasizes the deviation in haplotype frequencies among these two populations. For example, the diplotype A-C, corresponding to the mutated allele of rs1126671 and the wild-type allele of rs1800759, is very rare in our Swedish material (0.6%), whereas in the Italian cohort (27.9%) it is much more common.",

Although we did not find a significant association with CH in our Swedish case-control material, we could not exclude ADH4 as a candidate gene for CH. More studies on additional ADH4 SNPs as well as novel candidate genes will be needed to answer the question why and how alcohol may precipitate attacks during a bout in more than half of the patients with CH."
