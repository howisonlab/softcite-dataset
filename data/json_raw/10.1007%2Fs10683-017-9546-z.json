In the literature there are a variety of methods used for such elicitation; the concern of the experiment reported in this paper is to compare them. The methods we investigate are the following: Holt-Laury price lists; pairwise choices, the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak method; allocation questions. Clearly their relative efficiency in measuring risk aversion depends upon the numbers of questions asked; but the method itself may well influence the estimated risk-aversion. While it is impossible to determine a 'best' method (as the truth is unknown) we can look at the differences between the different methods. We carried out an experiment in four parts, corresponding to the four different methods, with 96 subjects. In analysing the data our methodology involves fitting preference functionals; we use four, Expected Utility and Rank-Dependent Expected Utility, each combined with either a CRRA or a CARA utility function. Our results show that the inferred level of risk aversion is more sensitive to the elicitation method than to the assumed-true preference functional. Experimenters should worry most about context."

This can be done in two ways: either directly, using the context of a particular experiment to estimate the risk-aversion that best explains behaviour; or indirectly, eliciting risk aversion in a separate part of the experiment, and using the elicited value to explain behaviour in the main experiment. It is to those experimenters that use the latter approach to whom this paper is addressed."

            "text": "Economic theory posits that decisions under risk depend on how people evaluate, and hence decide between, risky lotteries. By these we mean lotteries where the outcomes are risky, and where the probabilities are known. Clearly how people evaluate lotteries depends not only on the lotteries, but also on the preference functionals of the decision-maker (DM). In the literature there are a number of proposed preference functionals, the best-known of which is the Expected Utility functional. All of these embody the idea of an underlying utility function u(.); it is the degree of concavity of this when it is defined over money that indicates the degree of risk-aversion. It is this that we are trying to elicit."

            "text": "There are a number of methods that are used in the literature to elicit risk aversion. Possibly the most popular is that known as the Holt-Laury Price List, introduced by Holt and Laury (2002), and which we will refer to as HL. While the detail may vary from application to application, the basic idea is simple: subjects are presented with an ordered list of pairwise choices and have to choose one of each pair. The list is ordered in that one of the two choices is steadily getting better or steadily getting worse as one goes through the list. There are many variants on the basic theme: sometimes one of the two choices is a certainty, and that is getting better or worse through the list; sometimes either just one or both of the choices are risky choices and one of them is getting better or worse through the list. Because of the ordered nature of the list, subjects should choose the option on one side up to a certain point thereafter choosing the option on the other side. Some experimenters force subjects to have a unique switch point; others leave it up to subjects. 1 A second method is to give a set of Pairwise Choices, but separately (not in a list) and not ordered. We will refer to this as PC. Typically the pairwise choices are presented in a random order. This has been used by Hey and Orme (1994), amongst many others. Some argue that this method, whilst being similar to that of Price Lists, avoids some potential biases associated with ordered lists. Usually the pairwise choices are chosen such that they are distributed over one or more Marschak-Machina triangles. 2 A method which is elegant from a theoretical point of the view is the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism proposed by Becker et al. (1964). This we will later denote by Lottery Choice (LC) because of the way that we implement it. The method centres on eliciting the value to a subject of a lottery-if we know the value that a subject places on a lottery with monetary outcomes, we can deduce the individual's attitude to risk over money. There are two variants of this mechanism that are used in the literature: one where the DM is told that they own the lottery, and hence have the right to play it out or to sell it; and one where the DM is offered the chance to buy the lottery, and, if so, to then play out the lottery. The subject's valuation of the lottery as a potential seller is the minimum price for which they would be willing to sell it, while the subject's valuation of the lottery as potential buyer is the maximum price for which they would be willing to buy it. Here we describe the mechanism as it relates to a potential buyer-the mechanism is the same, mutatis mutandis, if it relates to a potential seller. The subject is asked to state a number; then a random device is activated, which produces a random number between the lowest amount in the lottery and the highest amount. If the random number is less than the stated number, then the subject buys the lottery at a price equal to the random number (and then plays out the lottery); if the random number is greater, then nothing happens and the subject stays as he or she was. If 3 the subject's preference functional is the expected utility functional then it can be shown that this mechanism is incentive compatible and reveals the subject's true evaluation of the lottery. Analytically it is equivalent to a Second Price Auction. The problem is that subjects do seem to have difficulty in understanding this mechanism, and a frequent criticism is that subjects understate their evaluation when acting as potential buyers and overstate it when acting as potential sellers. So in our experiment we implement this mechanism in a new way, which, we hope, is easier for subjects to understand, and which we will explain later.",

The chosen probability is an indicator of risk aversion. In an obvious sense the subject is choosing a distribution of his or her payment. The same is true with the Allocation method (which we have described above), the Becker-Degroot-Marschak method (which we have described above and which is analytically equivalent to a Second Price Auction), the 'Distribution Builder' task (in which subjects are asked to state a preferred distribution), the First Price Auction method (in which subjects have to state their valuation of a lottery), the Gneezy and Potters method (in which subjects are asked to allocate some money between a safe asset and a risky asset), and the 'Sequential Investment Task'."

(2007) This   Table 2: namely the very small number of observations per subject: in most of them (16 out of the 23 excluding the present paper) only one task is implemented for each subject. So for each method there is only one observation. Moreover, in most of these (depending upon the elicitation method), this observation can lead only to an interval estimate of risk-aversion. In stark contrast, our paper has many tasks for each elicitation method and we can get a point estimate of risk attitude. Loomes and Pogrebna come closest to what we do, but they make a different use of the data, carrying out comparisons across tasks within an elicitation method. In contrast we use all our data from each method to estimate risk-aversion. True, it may be the case, that with large numbers of tasks, subjects get fatigued and hence possibly noisier, but offsetting that is the increased precision from having more observations. There are slight differences in the way that different methods were implemented in these papers. For example the number of rows in the price lists of HL (usually 10 or 11), but these are relatively unimportant. There is a common theme to the way that the data is analysed in many of these papers: usually it is assumed that the preference functional of the subjects is CRRA; under this assumption, intervals for the subjects' risk aversions can be derived from the subjects' decisions. This is then compared across elicitation methods. Some papers go further-trying to fit a CRRA preference functional to the data. One example is Crosetto and Filippin (2016). To do this they have to convert their one observation from each method into several observations. Take, for example HL. They have one price list with 10 rows and thus 10 'decisions'. They then interpret these in their econometrics as 10 independent observations. We (as will be seen) go to the opposite extreme-interpreting them as completely dependent-our view being that subjects will choose a 'switch point' and then fill in the table. It is not clear which is the correct assumption. Crosetto and Filippin (2016) go even further with their Gneezy and Potters data where they say that ''we transformed the GP data into 40 binary choices''-assumed to be independent choices. Some papers estimate an average risk-aversion index (rather than estimating subject-by-subject) and some try to explain this with various demographics and control variables. Crosetto and Filippin (2016) also include something particularly interesting when they write: ''We show by means of a simulation exercise that part of the often observed heterogeneity of estimates across tasks is due to task-specific measurement error induced by the mere mechanics of the tasks.'' This, we suspect, is due to the way that the data from the different methods is analysed-using just one task to elicit an (interval) estimate of risk-aversion. Our method avoids this possible bias as we estimate across a number of tasks.  186 188 1Dave et al.",

Our paper is different, not only in the elicitation methods considered and contrasted, but also in our experimental design and in the number of tasks posed to subjects. We illustrated lotteries as pictures, rather than in words, believing that a pictorial representation aids understanding, with a consequent reduction in noise. We have a different way of implementing the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak method. Our data analysis also differs from virtually all of the previous literature: we fit preference functionals to the data. We use maximum likelihood techniques to estimate the parameters of our preference functionals. We consider not only EU (Expected Utility) preferences but also RD (Rank-Dependent Expected Utility), and also two different utility functions-CRRA and CARA. Thus we estimate different preference functionals, EU-CRRA, EU-CARA, RD-CRRA, and RD-CARA; and not only compare the four elicitation methods, but also the four preference functionals. We can do this as we have a lot more data than most studies."

If a particular lottery was chosen by this mechanism for paying out at the end of the experiment, the subject would draw a disk from a bag of 100 disks numbered from 1 to 100. The subject got paid the amount of money corresponding to the number on the disk. Let us give an example. Take the lottery in Fig. 1; this represents a lottery where there is a 1 in 2 (50 in 100) chance of gaining \u00a35 and a 1 in 2 (50 in 100) chance of gaining \u00a315. If this was played out at the end of the experiment, if the numbered disk was between 1 and 50 inclusive, the subject was paid \u00a35; if it was between 51 and 100 inclusive the subject was paid \u00a315. One of the possible advantages of this way of portraying lotteries is that the area indicates the expected value of the lottery.",

These are screen shots from the experimental software; they appeared full-screen in the experimental interface. In Fig. 2a, the thing that is staying constant is the lottery on the left (which is a 70% chance of \u00a315 and a 30% chance of \u00a30); the thing that is changing is that on the right-in this case a certainty-which increases from a certainty of \u00a31.50 to a certainty of \u00a315. Subjects were asked, for each pair in the list, to click on the preferred item; when doing so, the item on the other side turned grey. Figure 2b shows a possible set of responses-with the lottery being preferred to the certainty until the value of certainty reached \u00a36. To avoid problems with subjects switching at several points 9 within the list, the software forced subjects to choose a unique switching point. The 48 Price Lists spanned a variety of cases; details in https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/. We denote this method HL (as it comes from Holt-Laury mechanism).",

Typically subjects are shown a lottery and asked to state their maximum willingness-to-pay or minimum willingness-to-accept for the lottery. Many experimenters have reported confusion among subjects with understanding this mechanism, so we adopted a new way of implementing it. Suppose that we want to find the subject's certainty equivalent of a lottery which pays \u00a3x with probability p and \u00a3y with probability 1p, where x [ y. The subject is asked to choose a number \u00a3z. We want z to be the certainty equivalent. To obtain this in an incentive compatible way, 12 we could tell the subjects that a random number Z will be generated from a uniform distribution over the interval (y, x) and that they will get paid Z if Z [ z and will get to play out the lottery if Z B z. The optimal choice of z is the subject's certainty equivalent of the lottery. Consider the implications in terms of what they are choosing: their choice of z implies the choice of a lottery, which is a compound of the original lottery and the uniform distribution. To illustrate this, consider the lottery in Fig. 4a, where the payoffs are \u00a35 and \u00a315. If they state z = 5 they get to play out the lottery; if they state z = 15, they are opting for the lottery in Fig. 4b-that is a uniform 13 distribution over (5,15); if they state some number in between, for example 11, they are opting for the lottery in Fig. 4c. As z is varied from 5 to 15, the lottery in Fig. 4c varies from that in Fig. 4a to that in Fig. 4b. We simply asked them to choose their preferred lottery; they did this by moving the slider below the graph and then clicking on 'Confirm'. The implied   Fig. 4c is 11; this is the observed certainty equivalent.",

Then in Sect. 7.2 we compare the estimated parameters across preference functionals for given elicitation methods; finally in Sect. 7.3 we compare the estimated parameters across elicitation methods for given preference functionals. Table 3 presents some summary statistics. 19 It is very clear from this that the estimated parameters vary widely across the different elicitation methods. For example, using AL the risk-aversion index elicited in the RR specifications is, on average, much higher that found with the other methods, and also has a much higher spread. It may well be that the elicitation method is affecting the way that subjects process the problems. For example the allocation method may be focussing subjects' minds on what outcome they might obtain for different states of the world. The problematic parameter was often the g in the probability weighting function for RD. We imposed a lower limit of 0.3 (below which the weighting function is not monotonically increasing, and an upper limit which varied from subject to subject. 19 Note that the r value for the RR specifications cannot be compared with the r value for the AR specifications. The parameters of the various specifications are the risk-aversion index r (for both the EU and the RD functionals), the weighting function parameter g (for the RD functional) and the precision parameter s for all specifications. Some of these parameters are comparable across preference functionals (in that they have the same definition and interpretation) and some are not (like r with RR and r with RA-as the first measures the degree of relative risk aversion and the second the degree of absolute risk aversion). Table 4 shows the relationships between them for those that are comparable; Table 5 shows the relationships for those that are not comparable. Let us start with Table 4 where estimates are comparable. We can compare g across RRRD and ARRD, and similarly we can compare s across the various preference functionals. Also we can compare the r between RREU and RRRD, and between AREU and ARRD, though clearly if the true preference functional is Rank Dependent then assuming Expected Utility preferences may lead to bias. Table 4 reports the correlation (q) between the estimated parameters for different elicitation methods and the intercept (a) and slope (b) of a linear regression of one against the other. If they were consistently producing the same estimates then a should be zero, and b (and the correlation coefficient) should be one. Table 4 shows that the estimated values of s, across preference functionals, are generally not too far apart. For example, the estimated values of s (the precision parameter) using the AL method are very close whether we fit RREU or RRRD. This is less true for the estimated values of g (the weighting function parameter), though they are very similar using the LC method whether we fit RRRD or ARRD. However this is not always the case: for example, there are big differences between the estimated values of g using the PC method depending on whether we fit RRRD or ARRD. The estimated r values differ more markedly across the elicitation methods, though once again there are cases (using LC and comparing RREU and RRRD) where the fit is good. Even though it is difficult to summarise a whole table in one sentence, one could say that the correlations are all positive and reasonably large, and certainly larger than in Table 5 (comparisons across elicitation methods), which we shall come to shortly.",

Table 6 gives a summary, while Figs. 7, 8 and 9 present a subset of graphical comparisons (the full set of 60 sets of comparisons can be found in https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/). Let us start with Fig. 7 which shows the 6 scatters for the estimated r value for the RRRD functional; each scatter being the estimated values using one elicitation method plotted against the estimated values using another elicitation method, for all the nonexcluded subjects. Figure 7 corresponds to rows 13-18 of Table 6. As the scales on the two axes differ, it helps to fit a regression line to the scatter. Table 6 gives the intercept (-0.230) and slope (0.340) of this line. The intercept is significantly different from zero (at the 5% level) and the slope is significantly different from one (at 1%), as the asterisks indicate. As can be seen, the risk-aversion index elicited by AL is generally greater than that elicited by LC. This could result from what might be called a built-in bias with the allocation method-subjects tend to make allocations to avoid large differences in their payoff depending on which state occurs (thus encouraging risk-averse behaviour), while the BDM mechanism does not make so explicit the possible consequences of their actions. Indeed generally the risk-aversion elicited under allocation is generally higher than for the other three methods.",

Here the precision seems to be lower with the allocation method, and possibly highest on the Pairwise Choice method, though a direct comparison does not make much sense as the error on PC is on the utility difference (between the two lotteries) while the error on AL is on the difference in the amounts of implied money. The figure of the estimated g values in RRRD across elicitation methods (corresponding to rows 25-30 of Table 6, available in https://www.york.ac.uk/ economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/) is arguably the worst, usually showing very little relationship between the elicited g values for RRRD.

If that is true, then, if one is planning to use the elicited risk attitudes to explain behaviour in some economic problem, it would seem sensible to elicit the risk attitude in the same context as the economic problem. The simplest way of doing this is by eliciting the risk attitude from behaviour in the economics problem itself-that is, by finding the risk attitude which best explains their behaviour in that problem.

            "text": "If, however, one believes that there is a risk attitude out there, one can criticise what we have done on other grounds. There are several dimensions to the problem. We have studied two: the elicitation method and the functional specification. But there is also the dimension of the stochastic assumptions used when analysing the data. As Wilcox (2008) points out ''choices of stochastic models may be far more consequential than choices of structures such as expected utility or rank-dependent utility.'' But notice that he is comparing different functionals (which is what we do) and not different elicitation mechanisms. In that paper he shows that, when using the pairwise choice method for eliciting risk attitudes, the stochastic assumptions can lead to markedly changed elicited values. Once again one does not know the 'true' risk attitude, so one cannot declare one stochastic specification to be the 'best'. Chapter 6 of Bardsley et al. (2010), Blavatskyy and Pogrebna (2010) and Stott (2006) make the same point. Wilcox (2008) looks solely at pairwise choice problems. He considers a variety of stochastic specifications, most varying in their heteroscedasticity. Our stochastic specifications are all homoscedastic. Given the different nature of our methods, it is clearly not the case that we can apply the same set of heteroscedastic models to each method, so it is not clear what comparisons one can make. But to go some way to meeting this criticism we have refitted our allocation data with an heteroscedastic specification-a Beta distribution. 21 The figure of the results can be found in https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/exec/ research/zhouandhey1/. In the figure, the left-hand graph is a scatter of the riskaversion estimates for RREU obtained using the allocation method with a beta stochastic specification against that with the normal specification that we have used. The right-hand graph is the corresponding graph for RRRD. It will be seen that the estimates do differ a little with the stochastic specifications but the correlations are high (0.985 and 0.933 respectively). So there are variations in the estimates produced with the different elicitation methods, and (smaller?) variations with different stochastic specifications. The latter may cancel out the former, and indeed it may be the case that with each pair of elicitation methods there is a pair of stochastic specifications for which the same estimates are produced. This is unlikely but suggests an interesting project for future research.",

            "text": "This appears to send a clear message: risk-aversion should be elicited in the context in which it is to be interpreted. This suggests that one should estimate the risk-aversion index along with the other parameters of the model being fitted to the data; eliciting them in another context could lead to mis-interpretations of the data. As Loomes and Pogrebna (2014) write ''In the short run, one recommendation is that researchers who wish to take some account of and/or make some adjustment for risk attitude in their studies should take care to pick an elicitation procedure as similar as possible to the type of decision they are studying\u2026''. We would even go as far as suggesting modifying ''as similar as possible'' to ''in the same decision problem''. To give an example, in an experiment on First price auction behaviour, testing whether subjects are following the Nash-optimal risk-averse strategy, one can find the risk-aversion which best explains the bidding decisions of the subjects. This is effectively what Isaac and James (2000) do.",

            "text": "In summary, our results suggest something that has been found elsewhere (largely in the psychological literature): namely, that subjects do not have a stable preference functional for making decisions under risk. One thing that could be done, as we have hinted above, is to investigate more carefully the stochastic component of decision-making, and make the stochastic specifications specific to the method. Or we could take up Loomes and Pogrebna's call to understand better ''how contextual or procedural factors interact with that process [of decisionmaking].'' This is an important point. It suggests that economists should look at the process of decision-making, try and understand how people take decisions, and come up with behaviourally plausible preference stories relevant to particular elicitation methods. This suggests that risk-aversion might only have a meaning with a particular elicitation method, or, as we put it, in a particular context. Payne et al. (1992) make a similar point when they argue that ''preferences are often constructed rather than merely revealed'': that the strategy used to make a decision can be affected by the characteristics of the decision problem. They suggest that the selection of the strategy may be based on the tradeoff between effort and accuracy. This might be one possible explanation of our findings: for complicated elicitation methods, subjects might not be willing to expend sufficient effort to work out the 'correct' solution. In contrast, for simple elicitation methods, where less effort is required, subjects are more likely to reveal their 'true preferences'. This point is echoed by Sher and McKenzie (2006), who argue that the 'frame' (the elicitation method) may affect decision-making, and by Hsee (1996), who reinforces Payne et al.'s point above. In our terminology, the context, or the frame, or the elicitation method, may affect decisions, and hence matter.",
