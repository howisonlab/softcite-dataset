We have used a systems-based approach to examine the effects of acquired loss of Pkd1 in adult mouse kidney as it transitions from normal to cystic state. Methods: We performed transcriptional profiling of a large set of male and female kidneys, along with metabolomics and lipidomics analyses of a subset of male kidneys. We also assessed the effects of a modest diet change on cyst progression in young cystic mice. Fatty acid oxidation and glycolytic rates were measured in five control and mutant pairs of epithelial cells. Results: We find that females have a significantly less severe kidney phenotype and correlate this protection with differences in lipid metabolism. We show that sex is a major determinant of the transcriptional profile of mouse kidneys and that some of this difference is due to genes involved in lipid metabolism. Pkd1 mutant mice have transcriptional profiles consistent with changes in lipid metabolism and distinct metabolite and complex lipid profiles in kidneys. We also show that cells lacking Pkd1 have an intrinsic fatty acid oxidation defect and that manipulation of lipid content of mouse chow modifies cystic disease. Interpretation: Our results suggest PKD could be a disease of altered cellular metabolism.",

While advances have been made in slowing the progression of some other forms of chronic kidney disease, standard treatments have not reduced the need for renal replacement therapy in ADPKD (Spithoven et al., 2014). Unfortunately, several experimental interventions also have recently failed to show significant benefit in slowing the rate of functional decline (Serra et al., 2010;Walz et al., 2010;Schrier et al., 2014;, and the only positive study reported very modest effects (Torres et al., 2012). These findings suggest new treatment strategies are required.",

            "text": "A central dogma of molecular genetics is that discovery of the causative genes will lead to identification of key pathways and potential targets for intervention. In the case of ADPKD, the two genes mutated in the disorder, PKD1 and PKD2, were identified almost 20 years ago and yet their functions remain poorly understood. The PKD1 gene product, polycystin-1 (PC1), encodes a large membrane protein that requires the PKD2 gene product, polycystin-2 (PC2), for its trafficking to the primary cilium where the two are thought to form a receptor channel complex (Kim et al., 2014;Cai et al., 2014). What the complex senses and what it signals remains controversial. The primary cilium has emerged as a key player in the pathogenesis of PKD as mutations in dozens of different genes that encode either essential ciliary components or factors in ciliary signaling pathways result in PKD. A recent report suggests that the relationship between the polycystin complex and ciliary signaling is complicated, however. While ablation of primary cilia by mutation of core ciliary components results in cysts, these same perturbations done in the setting of Pkd1 or Pkd2 inactivation results in significant attenuation of cystic disease (Ma et al., 2013). These data suggest that the polycystin complex provides a suppressive signal for a novel, cilia-dependent growth-promoting pathway that is independent of MAPK/ERK, mTOR, or cAMP pathways, three effector pathways previously implicated as major drivers of cyst growth. The identities of the growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting pathways remain unknown.",

Building on our previous work identifying markedly different outcomes in animals with induced Pkd1 inactivation before or after P12 and correlating this susceptibility with metabolic status (Piontek et al., 2007;Menezes et al., 2012), we now show that female sex is partially protective in adult-induced Pkd1 inactivation, that sex differences in metabolic status may account for this effect, and that cells lacking Pkd1 have abnormal fatty acid oxidation. Finally, manipulating diet in Pkd1 mouse models, we demonstrate a positive correlation between lipid content in mouse chow and cystic kidney disease severity. Our results therefore suggest that abnormal lipid metabolism is an intrinsic component of PKD and an important modifier of disease progression.",

Detection of differentially expressed genes was performed using linear models and empirical Bayes methods implemented in the limma package (Smyth, 2004) in R. For time course analysis, splines and limma packages in R were used to fit separate curves in mutant males and females for each gene, and then the parameters corresponding to the interaction of time and sex were evaluated to identify genes with different temporal profile. Comparisons between mutant and control within sex were done in limma analyzing contrasts comparing samples collected at three different time intervals.

While this is perhaps to be expected, we were surprised to find that control kidneys were clustered in separate male and female groups. In fact, roughly the same number of genes was differentially expressed between control male and female kidneys (3502) as between all mutant and control male samples (3721; Fig.  1c). To verify if these transcriptional sex differences were present in other kidney datasets, we identified a large published dataset (GSE25506 (Derry et al., 2010)) including 706 control kidney samples. Comparing male and female kidneys in this set, we again detected differential expression in approximately 60% of the expressed genes ( Figure S2), strongly suggesting that in mice kidney gene expression patterns are sexually determined.",

Comparing three different disease stages (pre-cystic: P100-P139; cystic: P140-P190 and severely cystic: P190-P210) we identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes and confirmed that many differences become significant as disease progresses, few are unique to one sex, and in cystic samples the percentage of genes that are differentially expressed in both males and females increases (Fig. 1, e and f). This suggests that progression mechanisms are similar in males and females, just retarded in the latter. Gene ontology of differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table 2), in agreement with previous findings (Menezes et al., 2012;Rowe et al., 2013), suggests that metabolic pathways are dysregulated, including lipid (p = 9.13E-06) and fatty acid (1.28E-05) metabolism. Other notable categories include inflammation and cell locomotion/adhesion.",

In addition, we used shRNA to knock-down Pkd1 in a mouse collecting duct cell line (mCCD (Gaeggeler et al., 2005)). Measuring oxygen consumption rate (OCR) with an extracellular flux analyzer, we showed that in five different epithelial cell lines Pkd1 inactivation resulted in lower fatty acid oxidation (n = 5 pairs, p-value = 0.0001367; Fig. 3, a and b). Changes in glycolysis were not observed (Fig. 3, c and d, and Supplementary  Figure S5).

Since breast milk fatty acid composition can be manipulated through diet (Oosting et al., 2015), we tested the hypothesis by feeding nursing dams two chows that differ mainly in their lipid composition (NIH31 and NIH37; supplementary files 1 and 2) to nursing moms and young pups in two mouse models of Pkd1 inactivation: a tamoxifen-inducible line (ER-Cre), induced at 7 days of age (P7) and harvested at P21; and a Ksp-cre line, expressing the cre-recombinase under the control of Ksp and resulting in epithelial deletion of Pkd1 in mid-gestation, harvested at P14. The change in diet had no significant effect on body weight (p = 0.52 and p = 0.2, respectively; Fig. 4) and on both diets kidneys were quite cystic. However, in both lines, decreasing the lipid content of the diet by what seemed a trivial amount (from 7.47% fatty acids to 5.62%) resulted in a small but statistically significant improvement (ER-Cre model: p = 0.04, Cohen's d = 0.78; n = 19(NIH31) and 14(NIH37); 95% confidence interval reduction in KBW between 1.4% and 46.4%); Ksp-Cre model: p = 0.03, Cohen's d = 0.62; n = 26 (NIH31) and 26 (NIH37); 95% confidence interval reduction in KBW between 1.1% and 19.1%; Fig. 4).",

The current study significantly extends the prior work but also has important differences. Using a systems-based approach to examine the effects of acquired loss of Pkd1 in mouse kidney as they transition from normal to cystic state, we again found that differentially expressed genes showed enrichment for metabolic pathways and that these were associated with global metabolic differences in cystic kidneys. Importantly, we also found that sex was an important determinant of disease severity, that the transcriptional profiles of normal male and female kidneys differed almost as much as those of normal and cystic kidneys, and that differentially expressed gene modules were greatly enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolism.",

In addition, other groups have reported slower progression of many kidney diseases in females (reviewed in (Silbiger and Neugarten, 2008)) and that impaired fatty acid oxidation is a component of chronic kidney disease (Kang et al., 2015;Silbiger and Neugarten, 2008). We tested a role for lipid metabolism in PKD in two ways: a) fatty acid oxidation assay using cell lines (to differentiate between changes secondary to renal damage versus intrinsic defects in Pkd1 ko/ko cells); and b) the effects of dietary lipid on PKD progression in Pkd1 ko/ko mice. We found that renal epithelial cells lacking Pkd1 have cell autonomous defects in fatty acid oxidation. Notably, consistent with Warner et al., but not Rowe et al., (Warner et al., 2015;Rowe et al., 2013), we did not find elevated lactic acid levels in cystic kidneys nor enhanced glycolytic activity in renal epithelial cells lacking Pkd1.",

            "text": "There are a number of other lines of evidence that suggest that altered cellular metabolism might be a primary factor in PKD: 1) drugs known to have significant metabolic effects, like rapamycin and metformin, slowed cyst growth in Pkd1 ADPKD mouse models (Shillingford et al., 2010;Takiar et al., 2011); 2) ciliary signalingbelieved to be a major player in PKDplays an important role in regulating cellular metabolism via a number of different mechanisms, including direct control of mitochondrial function (Boehlke et al., 2010;Oh et al., 2015;Hoff et al., 2013); 3) mutations of several genes that encode proteins with primary metabolic functions have been reported to cause renal cysts, including fumarate hydratase (OMIM 150800) (Lehtonen et al., 2006;Adam et al., 2011) and, in glutaric acidemia type II (OMIM 231680), genes encoding proteins involved in electron transfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (ETFA, ETFB, ETFDH (B\u00f6hm et al., 1982;Wilson et al., 1989); 4) finally, a recent report describing that Fat (ft), an atypical cadherin, long-studied as a prototypical member of the planar cell polarity pathway (PCP) (Sing et al., 2014), undergoes proteolytic cleavage to release a soluble 68 kDa fragment that is imported into mitochondria where it binds directly to and stabilizes the activity of NADH dehydrogenase ubiquionone flavoprotein 2, a core component of complex I activity. As defects in planar cell polarity (PCP) can cause PKD, usually believed as secondary to disrupted mitotic spindle orientation or convergent-extension processes during development (Fischer et al., 2006;Karner et al., 2009), this finding is particularly interesting and may provide another link between cilia, metabolism and PKD. The observation that sex is an important determinant of disease severity in orthologous models of ADPKD has not been previously reported, but it is not surprising given that human studies suggest that males with autosomal dominant PKD have worse renal cystic disease but less severe liver cystic disease (Reed et al., 2008;Cnossen and Drenth, 2014). The interplay between sexual dimorphism and PKD severity likely occurs on multiple levels, as previous studies have identified inflammatory pathways and cAMP signaling as both important progression factors in PKD (Torres et al., 2004(Torres et al., , 2012Menon et al., 2011;Klawitter et al., 2013;Karihaloo et al., 2011) and subject to sex effects (Grimble, 2002;Barton and Prossnitz, 2015;Davis et al., 2014;Auger, 2003;Abrah\u00e1m and Herbison, 2005;Liu et al., 2011;Juul et al., 2014). Our data suggest that sexual differences in fatty acid metabolism may be another important disease-modulating factor.",

Gene expression analysis of samples of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was reported enriched for genes involved in inflammatory and metabolic pathways, particularly fatty acid oxidation (FAO), a pattern somewhat similar to the findings presented here (Kang et al., 2015). Similarly, transgenic mice overexpressing in proximal tubules PPARalpha, a known regulator of FAO, seemed to have reduced morphological damage after ischemic injury (Li et al., 2013). These effects are postulated to involve modulation of fibrotic responses. If and how such cascades relate to the metabolomics of PKD, if microcystic changes commonly found in CKD contribute to its metabolic component and what is unique or shared in the metabolic trigger or response of different kidney diseases remain to be studied.",

It should be noted that our study is unusual in that the diet manipulation was trivial: while many high-fat diet manipulations aim for fat as the primary source of energy, NIH-31 (~5.6% fat) and NIH-37 (~7.5%) can be used interchangeably in mouse colonies, the latter being sometimes preferred for lactating moms. That we can detect a difference should be a reminder that research conducted asynchronously or in different animal facilities within the same institution could not be directly comparable if diet is not standardized.

Data points are the rates measured between vertical lines C and D of the OCR profile (shape interior color: genotype). Paired t test: n = 5 pairs, p-value = 0.0001367. c and d) Plots showing extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as a readout for glyocolysis. c) ECAR as a percentage of baseline in two epithelial cell lines. The vertical dashed lines represent the sequential addition of 10 mM glucose, 1.5 \u03bcM oligomycin, 1.5 \u03bcM oligomycin and 50 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). d) Violin plots showing the glycolytic capacity of the experiment in the c panels, calculated as the increase over baseline after the addition of oligomycin (shape interior color: genotype). Paired t test: n = 2 pairs, p-value = 0.691.",
