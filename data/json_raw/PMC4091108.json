In this method, volatiles are pulled out through a trap that contains specific adsorbent. The collected volatiles are eluted with an organic solvent and analyzed using GC-MS.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare estimated volatiles in different treatments as a percentage (proportion) or normalized (amounts). Post hoc pairwise comparisons between treatments were performed with the Tukey honestly significant different test. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were used to discriminate among treatments. The PCA and CA were performed using the normalized data of individual VOCs and 3 main groups. PCA was used to summarize the pattern of correlation among the detected compounds in the different treatments. CA based on the Mahalanobi's squared distance between groups from the discriminant function analysis (DFA), with 95% confidence, was used to construct the similarity dendograms."

Terpenoids represent the largest VOCs in most plant leaves. 9,25 Both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes protect plants against biotic or abiotic stresses. 24,26 Plant infestation by herbivores induces compounds implicated in antixenosis or antibiosis, 27 and attracts natural enemies. 28 In addition, the infection with pathogens induces the production of antimicrobial compounds. 29 In general, terpenoids play an important role in plant-herbivore-pathogen interaction. 30 Many plants show high emission of monoterpenes after herbivory and/ or pathogen attack. Monoterpenes may act as kairomones in attracting predators and parasitoids to attacked plants, 14 as well as function as phytoalexins, 31 affect oviposition behavior, 32, 33 and act as feeding deterrents for insects. 34 Monoterpenes and sesquiterterpenes were found to be induced systemically in Pinus sylvestris by egg deposition of the sawfly Diprion pini. 24 As expected, in our results, there were no significant differences in the abundances of GLVs (C6) between ACP-infested and/or CLas-infected and control plants. In fact, the plant bleeds GLVs instantaneously from disrupted tissue as a wounding response, but AC P causes minimal damage to plant tissue; therefore, no effect on GLVs was found.",

            "text": "Plant response for piercing-sucking insects such as aphids, mealy bugs, leafhoppers, and psyllids is different than that for chewing insects. 35 Although piecing-sucking insects do not cause significant cell damage, during their prolonged stylet interactions, injected elicitors might induce specific reactions. 36 In general, chewing insects induce the expression of jasmonic acid pathway (JA) regulated gene and wound-responsive gene while the piercing-sucking insects such as ACP induces salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway 3 and JA pathway. 36 In ACP-infested leaves, 17 compounds were significantly higher in ACP-infested plants. Attack with other species of psyllids induces many changes in leaf VOCs. For example, Psylla pyricola feeding causes simultaneous changes in the composition of released and stored VOCs in pear trees. 37 Relative abundance of secondary metabolite volatiles in the leaves of avocado was correlated positively with psyllid (Trioza anceps) attack. 38 Aphids also induce the release of VOCs including \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, cymene, \u03b1-phellandrene, and d-limonene. 39 In our study, monoterpene alcohol in ACP-infested and double-attacked plant leaves was changed from 8.8% to 15.4%. The main volatile compound of monoterpene alcohol was linalool, which increased 7-fold compared with the control. In fact, linalool is a cue molecule that helps insects locate and recognize plants. 40 Linalool synthase in tomato was induced in leaf trichomes by spider mite infestation. 41 Linalool and ocimene were induced in lima bean after spider mite attack. 42 Ocimene was increased in ACP-infested and double-attacked but not in CLasinfected leaves as compared with the control. It seems that to induce ocimene, plants need several events such as several feeding periods by insect. A study supporting this idea showed that a single event of damage for Lotus japonicus plants did not induce the release of (E)-\u03b2-ocimene from the plants. 43 The monoterpene myrcene, was also increased in ACP-infested plants. This observation was found in Arabidopsis infested by P. rapae. 44 \u03b1-humulene, (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene, and caryophyllene oxide were increased as a response to ACP-infestation. Both \u03b1-humulene and caryophyllene oxide were also induced in response to simultaneous infestation with sap-feeder insect, Frankliniella occidentalis, and chewing insect, Heliothis virescens. 45 Some induced volatiles in ACP-infested plants were reported to be biologically active and attractive for natural enemies such as sabinene and \u03b1-pinene. 46 (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene was increased in ACP-infested plants. The release of (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene attracts entomopathogenic nematodes to Diabrotica virgifera larvae around maize roots. 47 Plants infested with sap-feeder insects such as aphids are induced to release VOCs that attract parasitoid wasps 48 and determine aphid densities on host plants. 49 \u03b2-ocimene, linalool, \u03b1-farnesene, \u03b2-farnesene were induced by corn leaf aphid feeding. 10,49 Our findings revealed that (E)-\u03b2-farnesene was higher in ACP-infested than CLas-infected plants and control. (E)-\u03b2farnesene is an aphid alarm pheromone and is also released from aphid-infested plants to call parasitoids. 48 \u03b1-pinene was found to repel spruce beetle from Pinus resinosa plants and enhance predator's attraction. 50 In our study, \u03b1-pinene increased 5-fold in ACP-infested plants compared with control. The monoterpenes p-cymene, \u03b1-terpinene, and \u03b1-phellandrene repelled Bemisia tabaci when these compounds were applied on tomato. 51 \u03b2-sinensal was increased (4-fold) in ACP-infested plants. \u03b2-sinensal represents 9.4% of compounds in sandalwood oil. This oil produced mortality and deterrent effects against two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. 52 (E)-\u03b2caryophyllene which increased 3-fold in ACP-infested plants compared with control was reported as attractant to newly emerged females of phloem-sap psyllid, Cacopsylla picta, the vector of Candidatus Phytoplasma mali in apple. 53 Sabinene was the highest compound in healthy trees and increased in all treatments especially in ACP-infested trees (more than 4-fold) and in double-attacked trees (more than 2-fold). (E)-ocimene, d-limonene, myrcene, and sabinene were the main volatiles produced by the new shoots of citrus that attract ACP. 23 The infection with plant pathogens induces the production of plant volatiles that possess a powerful antimicrobial activity to inhibit the movement of the pathogens within plant tissues. 3,54 Although, the percentage profile of VOCs in CLas-infected plants was highly affected, only 4 compounds were increased in leaves from CLas-infected plants. These compounds include 3 monoterpenes (d-limonene, \u03b2-phelandrene, and citronellal) and an aldehyde (undecanal).",

In vitro studies showed that tomato leaf volatiles, including \u03b2-phelandrene and other compounds inhibited Botrytis cinerea fungus. 55 The antimicrobial activity of d-limonene was also assessed against 8 organisms. 56 It has been found that CLas-infected citrus plants released less d-limonene than healthy plants. 18 In current study, we showed an accumulation of d-limonene in leaves from CLas-infected plants. It could be a result of the induction of its biosynthesis and/or inhibition of its release. Theoretically, the level of any volatile in plant leaf is controlled by the rate of its formation and the rate of its loss (release or catabolism). 57 Volatiles could be released from storage glands or biosynthesized de novo following insect damage. 58 A previous study showed that CLas-infected citrus plants were initially more attractive to D. citri adults than non-infected plants. However, after probing, psyllids moved to non-infected plants and settled. 18 Volatile cues may be implicated in the initial movement of psyllids to CLas-infected plants; while the arrestment is determined by the nutritional status of the host, a phenomenon was reported in other vector-borne diseases .17,59 The results of the previous studies together indicate that the infection makes plants more attractive to insect-vectors by suppressing the plants basal defense, releasing attractive volatiles, or by inhibiting the release of deterrent volatiles. This will help in continuously spreading the disease by the vector. From the evolutionary view, there is a two-edge benefit for both the releaser and the receiver. First, for the releaser, it is a kind of resistance and may be used to invite natural enemies of ACP; second, for the receiver (ACP), this will direct the adults of insects to infest new trees, subsequently, less competition and increased distribution.",

It has been shown in other systems that the double biotic stress may compromise the plant response. 45 Plants attacked by more than 1 attacker produce some compounds that may induce a pathway and reduce the activity of another pathway and cause synergistic or antagonistic effects on other pathways. Pathogen-inducible SA causes downregulation of the JA/ethylene-regulated defense-response genes, as well as JA-regulated wound responses and secondary metabolite accumulation. 60,61 CA analysis using individual volatiles or main groups showed that VOCs profile in the leaves from double-attacked plants was closer to the profile of CLas-attacked plants than ACP-attacked plants. PCA of normalized data using individual volatiles or main group showed that double-attacked plants were closer to control than other treatments. These results prove that CLas infection compromises the responses of plant to ACP for its benefit.",
