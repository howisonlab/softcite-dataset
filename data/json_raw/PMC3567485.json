            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene silencing process within living cells, which is controlled by the RNA-induced silencing complex with a sequence-specific manner. In flies and mice, the pseudogene transcripts can be processed into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that regulate protein-coding genes through the RNAi pathway. Following these findings, we construct an innovative and comprehensive database to elucidate siRNA-mediated mechanism in human transcribed pseudogenes (TPGs). To investigate TPG producing siRNAs that regulate protein-coding genes, we mapped the TPGs to small RNAs (sRNAs) that were supported by publicly deep sequencing data from various sRNA libraries and constructed the TPG-derived siRNA-target interactions. In addition, we also presented that TPGs can act as a target for miRNAs that actually regulate the parental gene. To enable the systematic compilation and updating of these results and additional information, we have developed a database, pseudoMap, capturing various types of information, including sequence data, TPG and cognate annotation, deep sequencing data, RNA-folding structure, gene expression profiles, miRNA annotation and target prediction. As our knowledge, pseudoMap is the first database to demonstrate two mechanisms of human TPGs: encoding siRNAs and decoying miRNAs that target the parental gene. pseudoMap is freely accessible at http://pseudomap. mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.",

            "text": "Pseudogenes are genomic DNA sequences homologous to functional genes yet are not translated into proteins (1). Although pseudogenes are often considered the structurally defective non-functional copies of protein-coding genes, the human genome comprises more numbers of pseudogenes than corresponding functional genes (2). Despite the previous assumption of pseudogenes as genomic fossils, the genome-wide investigations have demonstrated actively transcribed pseudogenes (TPGs) with functional potential (3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12). For instant, TPG of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS) acts as an antisense regulator of neuronal NOS protein synthesis in snails (13,14). Another study has established that binding of transcriptional repressor to receptor of makorin1-p1 could activate the homologous parental gene Mkrn1 (15), despite contradictory result was also reported (16). In addition, the TPG of PTENP1 ( PTEN), a highly conserved processed pseudogene of tumour suppressor PTEN, acts as a miRNA-decoy by binding to PTEN-targeting miRNAs (17). Moreover, human pseudogene myosin light chain kinase pseudogene 1 is partially duplicated from the original MYLK gene and promotes cancer cell proliferation (18). Above findings clearly suggest that the non-coding RNA products of TPGs may play an important role in biogenesis pathway and functional processes.",

An attempt was made to identify the candidates of TPG-derived esiRNAs, by aligning the sequences of TPGs and fsRNAs. These candidates were verified using the deep sequencing data from various sRNA libraries (35)(36)(37)(38) experimented with on human embryo stem cells, liver tissues or HCC tissues. The hairpin structure by Mfold (40) was then determined by using the extended sequences of these candidates of esiRNAs. In pseudoMap, a total of 1232 TPGs may produce esiRNAs, which were profiling by deep sequencing data, within 1404 human TPGs were characterized. The information of these TPGs is shown in Supplementary File 1. The results showed that 4 miRNAs and 326 piRNAs may derive from TPGs. We also found that miRNA has-miR-622 was identified, which was derived from keratin 18 pseudogene 27, located on nt 858-879, as similar as miRBase database.

In this study, we analyse the relationships between TPG and its cognate gene with miRNA decoys mechanism to examine miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) by performing a pipeline. First, the parental genes were obtained by mapping the TPGs and genomic sequences with the BLAST (51) program. The MTIs with TPGs and parental genes were then investigated using our previous approach (41). The MFE threshold was \u00c020 kcal/mol with a score more than or equal to 150 for miRanda and default parameters for TargetScan and RNAhybrid. Finally, the TPGs and their cognates co-regulated by miRNAs were obtained. The miRNA and 3'UTR sequences were obtained from miRBase R18 (29,30) and Ensembl Genome Browser release 63 (26), respectively. Analysis results indicated that 874 miRNAs with MFE \u00c020 and Score ! 150 interact with many possible target sites in 248 TPGs and their cognate genes and might potentially co-regulate this pair of TPG and parental gene ( Supplementary File 2).",

The interface contains general information of TPGs, the relationships of TPG and its cognate gene with miRNAmediated repression termed as 'miRNA Regulator', TPG-derived eSTIs named as 'esiRNA', and 'Expression' showed the gene expression profiles. Figure 3B provides a detailed view of miRNA regulator, which displays more fine-grained information. Above results indicated the relationships between TPGs and cognate genes by a miRNA decoy mechanism such as that observed by Poliseno et al. (17). The 'Expression' presents the gene expression profiles of not only distinct TPG and corresponding parental gene but also TPG referenced by cognate in various experimental conditions ( Figure 3C). Moreover, the view of esiRNA indicates the TPG-derived esiRNAs and graphical display of deep sequencing data ( Figure 3D). The red line represents the TPG and the blue line refers to esiRNAs. We also estimate the eSTIs ( Figure 3E) and the RNA folding structure of TPG-derived esiRNA ( Figure 3F). All the results and sequences can be downloaded for further experimental tests. In pseudoMap, we also incorporate the external sources, such as UCSC genome browser (39) for a genomic view, GeneCards (52) for gene annotation and miRBase (29) for miRNA annotation ( Figure 3G).

In particular, PseudoGene database (53) identifies pseudogenes using various computational methods in genomes; HOPPSIGEN (54) represents the homologous processed pseudogenes shared between the mouse and human genomes that contains location information and potential function; as a web-based system, PseudoGeneQuest (55) identifies novel human pseudogenes based on a userprovided protein sequence; in addition, the University of Iowa's UI Pseudogenes website contains human pseudogenes and the candidates for gene conversion (56). However, these databases focus on automatic detection of pseudogenes by using a variety of homology-based approaches. Our database, pseudoMap, aims at providing comprehensive resource for genome-wide identifying the functions and regulators of human TPGs. In briefly, there are three major differentiating features from currently public databases of pseudogenes. First, pseudoMap elucidates the relationships of TPG and its cognate gene with miRNA decoys mechanism. Second, to explore the interaction of TPG and its parental gene, pseudoMap provides the gene expression profiles of TPG and its cognate gene in various experimental conditions. Third, pseudoMap curates the TPG-derived esiRNAs, which supported by deep sequencing data, as well as their interacting gene targets in the human genome. Table 3 lists the detailed comparisons of pseudoMap with other previous databases related to pseudogenes.",

Another application is that both the gene and pseudogene contain miRNA target sites, if the pseudogene competes for the freely available repressor molecules that would be free the gene to reduce the miRNA-mediated repression. Another words, the pseudogene may act as a 'miRNA decoy' to release the repression of its cognate gene. pseudoMap provides another insight into the pathway of MTIs with TPG-mediated mechanism.",

To our knowledge, the pseudoMap is the first database to identify TPGs to enable biologists and bioinformaticians to elucidate two major discoveries, the relationships between TPG and its cognate gene with miRNA decoyed mechanisms and TPG-derived eSTIs. Efforts are underway in our laboratory to expand the methods used in pseudoMap to other species such as mice, fruit flies and plants. The pseudoMap will be updated frequently by continuingly surveying experimentally validated sRNAs and will be maintained with a long-term support from National Chiao Tung University and National Science Council at Taiwan.
