            "text": "A glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is a common but complex C-terminal post-translational modif ication of extracellular proteins in eukaryotes. Here we investigate the problem of correctly annotating GPI-anchored proteins for the growing number of sequences in public databases. We developed a computational system, called FragAnchor, based on the tandem use of a neural network (NN) and a hidden Markov model (HMM). Firstly, NN selects potential GPI-anchored proteins in a dataset, then HMM parses these potential GPI signals and ref ines the prediction by qualitative scoring. FragAnchor correctly predicted 91% of all the GPI-anchored proteins annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. In a large-scale analysis of 29 eukaryote proteomes, FragAnchor predicted that the percentage of highly probable GPI-anchored proteins is between 0.21% and 2.01%. The distinctive feature of FragAnchor, compared with other systems, is that it targets only the C-terminus of a protein, making it less sensitive to the background noise found in databases and possible incomplete protein sequences. Moreover, FragAnchor can be used to predict GPI-anchored proteins in all eukaryotes. Finally, by using qualitative scoring, the predictions combine both sensitivity and information content. The predictor is publicly available at http://navet.ics.hawaii.edu/\u223cfraganchor/NNHMM/NNHMM.html.",

            "text": "The complexity of information contained in protein sequences is a major challenge for large-scale analysis of proteomics data: some characteristics are easily identifiable, such as general hydrophobicity, whereas others are well hidden, such as the presence of short segments endowed with a specific function but having been affected by numerous mutations during their evolution. Identifying and classifying correctly these characteristics often requires novel approaches that assist standard tools of analysis. Furthermore, the structure of protein sequences translated from genes is not sufficient to assess the overall complexity of their functions. Indeed, post-translational modifications (PTMs) can spawn, for example, changes of activity, cellular localization, or protein interaction (1 ). PTMs such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors *Corresponding author. E-mail: guylaine@hawaii.edu are fundamental for understanding biological functions of proteins; however, studies are suffering from a shortage of efficient methods that could allow to identify them in large-scale analyses (2 ). The prediction of PTM in protein sequences is then an integral part of an in-depth study fostering the understanding of biological functions, which turns out to be an important step in the annotation of proteomes.",

            "text": "Glycosylation is one of the most common and complex forms of PTMs (3 , 4 ). It is classified into three categories: N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and the attachment of a glycolipide (GPI) to the C-terminus of a protein. A GPI anchor is a type of membrane attachment discovered fairly recently. Its occurrences in eukaryotic cells were identified in the 1980s through the works of several researchers (5)(6)(7)(8)(9). Among proteins with GPI anchors one finds enzymes, adhesive proteins, receptors, activation antigens, and so on (10 , 11 ). Currently the exact function of this at-tachment is not well characterized (12 ). Nonetheless, its conservation across great taxonomic diversity (yeasts, protozoa, plants, vertebrates, and even archeo-bacteria) suggests some important functionality (13 ). Proteins with GPI anchors reveal a very interesting feature that they are exclusively extracellular. This PTM thus provides interesting information for the annotation of new sequences by specifying their cellular localizations. Moreover, this property of GPI-anchored proteins opens the way to several potential applications. For example, in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum (human malaria parasite), several proteins that are attached to the membrane by a GPI anchor can be used as vaccine candidates (14 ).",

Indeed, there is no clear constant, approximate, or repetitive pat-terns, and similarity analysis yields poor results (results not shown). Nonetheless, some general rules have been identified. For example, GPI-anchored proteins have an N-terminal signal for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum. However, we discovered that this signal is absent or not clearly predicted by computational tools in nearly 7% of the annotated GPI-anchored proteins in the Swiss-Prot database (http://www.expasy.org/sprot/). Besides the N-terminal signal, the C-terminal GPI signal, cleaved off at the time of the addition of the GPIlipid anchor, can be further broken down into 4 regions (15 ): (1) an unstructured linker region of about 10 residues; (2) a region of small residues, including the GPI attachment and cleavage site; (3) a spacer region, following the cleavage site, of about 7 amino acids (a.a.); (4) a hydrophobic tail next to the spacer region, completing the C-terminus ( Figure 1).",

            "text": "Currently, there exist three different predictors publicly available: big-\u03c0 (15 ) from the University of Vienna (available in two versions, one for metazoa and one for protozoa), DGPI from the University of Geneva (retrieved from http://129.194.185.165/ dgpi/), and the large-scale annotator GPI-SOM (16 ) from the University of Bern. The first two also predict potential cleavage sites while the third does not. These tools target the C-terminal and N-terminal signals of protein sequences, or require verifying the presence of the N-terminal signal before submitting sequences to the predictor. This affects automatically their performance in the presence of fragmented or partial sequences, which happen to be more and more common in databases. In particular, metagenome projects generate many fragmented sequences representing only partial proteins, complicating the annotation process. Moreover, with metagenome projects, the inability to relate many of the new sequences to a specific taxonomic group does not favor the use of a group-specific tool like big-\u03c0. Therefore, large-scale annotation tools, which are able to predict the presence of a particular motif at different levels of precision (that is, to assess each prediction in a qualitative way) with minimal information, are then needed to address this new reality, since tools that are too restrictive or specialized often lack the flexibility needed to make correct predictions. For example, a recent analysis of the P. falciparum proteome shows that big-\u03c0, DGPI, and GPI-SOM generated poor results in predicting proteins selected as biologically validated or highly probable candidates (14 ). Accordingly, our system was designed to offer the precision of cleavage site prediction tools and the flexibility needed for a large-scale annotator in a noisy environment.",

We did not compare FragAnchor with DGPI because the design of this tool makes large dataset analysis difficult. Since big-\u03c0 and GPI-SOM require the use of SignalP (18 ) for the N-terminal signal peptide prediction, we included an evaluation of FragAnchor combined with SignalP to help the comparison process. However, the use of SignalP is not required before using FragAnchor. Compared with big-\u03c0, FragAnchor is more sensitive to the GPI-anchoring pattern even if we consider only the first three classes (highly probable, probable, and weakly probable). For the first set of 121 GPI-anchored sequences, Fra-gAnchor correctly predicted 88.43% of them (82.64% in Classes 1-3) while big-\u03c0 accepted 60.33%. For the newly analyzed P. falciparum sequences, as pointed out in Gilson et al (14 ), most predictors failed to predict a significant number of sequences known to bear GPI anchor. In Table 3, we can see that FragAnchor has a very high capacity of prediction with only one sequence wrongly predicted. Even when discarding the potential false positive sequences, FragAnchor recognizes more GPI-anchored sequences than big-\u03c0 does. One of the reasons of the better performance of FragAnchor is the fact that it does not need the presence of the N-terminal signal, which is not clearly detectable in 6 of the 30 P. falciparum sequences.",

However, this high stringency is accompanied by a poor capacity of prediction for the GPI anchor signal. Nonetheless, we achieved a specificity of FragAnchor comparable to that of GPI-SOM and big-\u03c0. The specificity was computed by adding the proportions of the first three classes (Table 2), for example, for the cytoplasm and nuclear proteins, it is 0.21 + 0.16 + 0.27 = 0.64. For the membrane transport proteins, FragAnchor gave more false positive predictions. However, for this set of proteins, it is possible that some of them will eventually be validated as real GPI-anchored proteins in laboratory experiments.",

This fact confirms the effectiveness of an annotation not based on the prediction of this signal. In short, the comparison with other tools is not easy due to the uniqueness of the tandem method.

In addition, it offers a high level of flexibility with respect to the organism considered. Studies like the P. falciparum proteome analysis by Gilson et al (14 ), where the available predictors failed to predict the biochemically proposed new GPI-anchored proteins, show that there is a need for a more flexible and universal predictor. The flexibility and accuracy achieved by FragAnchor offer an excellent annotator for the GPI anchor signal designed for all metagenome projects. One of the main goals of this large-scale prediction tool is to offer greater flexibility to the users. We propose a tool that offers different levels of sensitivity to the GPI anchor signal. The tests reveal that the combination of the two machine learning approaches yields very good results. The tandem system is a very general (all eukaryotes) tool for the annotation of GPI-anchored proteins on a large scale by using minimal information. It produces prediction with a qualitative annotation allowing the user to choose the strength of precision that he/she wants. The less sensitive classes may contain sequences with unusual GPI anchor signals, which can yield to new discoveries in the PTM research area.",

The choice of the length of the C-terminal section was based on an analysis of Swiss-Prot GPI-anchored proteins, which showed a maximum length of 45 a.a. for the C-terminal signal. To give some flexibility to the system, we selected an input vector of 50 a.a. Since neural networks accept numerical input, and given the importance of molecular weight and hydrophobicity in the anchoring process, we encoded each amino acid with its hydropathy on the Kyte and Doolitle scale (21 ), as well as its molecular weight. The last step is the normalization of the input vectors.

These putative cleavage sites were identified with a sliding window that detects groups of three amino acids of small molecular weight. This is how HMM can also predict cleavage sites. The Forward algorithm computed the likelihood of a sequence, and the Viterbi algorithm (26 ) computed the most probable path for each sequence. The three best, in terms of scores, possible cleavage sites were recorded.",

The HMM score obtained on each sequence is then used to classify the sequence. This classification ranges from \"highly probable\" to \"potential false positive\" (Table 5). Each class of annotation was defined using a graphical representation of false-positive and true-positive predictions at all discrimination threshold, the ROC curve. This qualitative annotation allows us to keep the high sensitivity (proportion of all true positives correctly predicted) obtained with NN, together with the specificity (proportion of all true negatives correctly predicted) and the capacity of HMM to identify some features of the GPI signal, such as the cleavage site. The major advantage of using the qualitative scoring in a largescale annotator is its fast and easy identification of the best predictions and the possible false positives. NN can detect the GPI anchor motif efficiently but its architecture does not give us any information about the primary structure of the motif, while the use of HMM provides this information. Consequently, we can refine the prediction depending on the quality of the signal present in the protein sequence. Fig. 4 The structure of the tandem system. ",
