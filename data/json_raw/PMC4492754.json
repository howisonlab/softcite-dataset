CS-917 is a bisamidate prodrug and activation of CS-917 requires a two-step enzyme catalyzed reaction. The first-step enzyme, esterase, catalyzes the conversion of CS-917 into the intermediate form (R-134450) and the second-step enzyme, phosphoramidase, catalyzes the conversion of R-134450 into the active form (R-125338). In this study, we biochemically purified the CS-917 esterase activity in monkey small intestine and liver. We identified cathepsin A (CTSA) and elastase 3B (ELA3B) as CS-917 esterases in the small intestine by mass spectrometry, whereas we found CTSA and carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in monkey liver. We also purified R-134450 phosphoramidase activity in monkey liver and identified sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, acid-like 3A (SMPADL3A), as an R-134450 phosphoramidase, which has not been reported to have any enzyme activity. Recombinant human CTSA, ELA3B, and CES1 showed CS-917 esterase activity and recombinant human SMPDL3A showed R-134450 phosphoramidase activity, which confirmed the identification of those enzymes. Identification of metabolic enzymes responsible for the activation process is the requisite first step to understanding the activation process, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of CS-917 at the molecular level. This is the first identification of a phosphoramidase other than histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein (HINT) family enzymes and SMPDL3A might generally contribute to activation of the other bisamidate prodrugs.",

R-125338 was designed to target the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-binding site of FBPase using a structure-based drug design (Erion et al. 2007). Although R-125338 showed good FBPase inhibition, its oral bioavailability was not sufficient. To improve the oral bioavailability of R-125338, CS-917 was designed as a bisamidate prodrug of R-125338, which gave us sufficient bioavailability and FBPase inhibition in vivo (Dang et al. 2007).",

A large variability in the plasma concentration of CS-917 and R-125338 was also observed. Since CS-917 esterase activity in human plasma was relatively weak compared to that in the small intestine and liver (data not shown), the plasma concentration of CS-917 would be determined by the degree of CS-917 hydrolysis in the first-pass metabolism and phosphoramidase of the intermediate R-134450 could contribute to R-125338 variation.",

We used the HIC column for the first column and the first and the second active peaks were purified separately afterwards. As a result of successive five-step purification, the first and the second active peaks were purified more than 4000-fold (Table 1) and 8000fold (Table 2), respectively. In the fourth (Fig. S2A and B) and final ( Fig. 2B and C) purification step of the first active peak, we found bands of 30, 17, and 15 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels which correlated well with the CS-917 esterase activity. Therefore, we analyzed the proteins in these three bands by mass spectrometry and identified monkey elastase 3B (NCBI gene identifier: 62510667, human homologous gene symbol: ELA3B) from all three bands. Similarly, in the fourth (Fig. S2C and D) and final ( Fig. 2D and E) purification step of the second active peak, we found bands of 26 and 17 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels which correlated well with the enzyme activity, and we identified the protein in these bands as monkey cathepsin A (NCBI gene identifier: 109091751, human homologous gene symbol: CTSA) by mass spectrometry.",

We cloned human homologous genes because our final goal is to identify CS-917 esterase in humans. Considering the differences between species, we regarded other human pancreatic elastases (ELA2A, ELA2B and ELA3A) as candidates for CS-917 esterase in addition to ELA3B. We produced the recombinant proteins in human cells, purified them using FLAG-tag fused with their carboxyl-terminal, activated them if necessary, and tested their specific activity. In addition to pancreatic elastases, we also tested ELA2. Fortunately, active ELA2 purified from human leukocytes was commercially available. With regard to CTSA, we obtained commercially available human CTSA and activated them with cathepsin L as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure 3, CTSA demonstrated the highest specific activity as CS-917 esterase while ELA2 and ELA3B exhibited moderate specific activity, and ELA3A showed weak specific activity. ELA2A and ELA2B did not hydrolase CS-917. In parallel, we tested ELA2A and ELA2B's elastase activity using synthetic peptide substrates. The results revealed ELA2A had elastase activity but ELA2B did not (Fig. S3), indicating that our ELA2A was certainly active but did not have CS-917 esterase activity. With regard to ELA2B, a recent report showed ELA2B was devoid of proteolytic activity (Szepessy and Sahin Toth 2006). Thus, our ELA2B was supposed to be inactive due to its intrinsic character.",

Next, we investigated the PMSF effect on CS-917 esterase activity separated with an HIC column in monkey small intestine homogenates. Interestingly, we found that all 4 homogenates prepared from monkeys (monkey #2 to #5) other than monkey #1 formed a single active peak after HIC column separation and that the activity was relatively insensitive to 1 mmol/L PMSF (Fig. 4).

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of a CESspecific inhibitor, BNPP, on human liver S9 and observed that the high concentration of BNPP (10 mmol/L) did not show an inhibitory effect on human liver S9, but it did show significant inhibition on dialyzed human liver S9 (Fig. S6). These data indicated that BNPP could not inhibit CS-917 esterase activity in a crude sample for some reason. Therefore, we separated 20-70% ammonium sulfate precipitate of monkey liver homogenates by HIC, and tested the BNPP effect on its fractions. Considering the possibility of the purification of liver CS-917 esterase, we used cynomolgus monkey liver for the same reasons we used the monkey small intestine.

Quantitation of CES1 (C) and CTSA (E) by mass spectrometry using emPAI (closed and open box lines) correlated well with the enzyme activity. Four independent experiments were conducted, and the average of technical duplicates from a representative single experiment is shown with error bars representing the higher value.

We quantified the relative abundance of CES1 and CTSA using a label-free spectral count method and found that the CES1 amount correlated well with CS-917 esterase activity purified from the first active peak and that the CTSA amount correlated well with the activity purified from the second active peak in the presence of 1 mmol/L BNPP ( Fig. 5C and E).

CES2 was not identified as CS-917 esterase in the small intestine, therefore CES2 was not supposed to have CS-917 esterase activity, but we included CES2 as a good negative control.

We chose the liver as a purification source because the liver is the target organ of the FBPase inhibitor. As a result of preliminary experiments, R-134450 phosphoramidase activity was localized in the cytosolic fraction ( Fig. S7) and the observed molecular weight was 65-83 kDa by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. S8). We purified R-134450 phosphoramidase activity from monkey liver by successive five-step purification after ammonium sulfate precipitation. The enzyme activity was concentrated more than 9000-fold (Table 3). The enzyme activity formed a single peak in all chromatography steps, which indicated the enzyme was single. After the third purification step, we found that bands of 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels were correlating well with the enzyme activity (Fig. 6). We identified the protein of these 50 kDa bands by mass spectrometry as sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, acid-like 3A (Human homologous gene symbol: SMPDL3A).",

            "text": "As far as we know, only two genes were reported as phosphoramidases in the literature (Bieganowski et al. 2002;Seidle et al. 2005). These two genes, HINT1 and APTX, belong to the same HINT enzyme family, and this HINT enzyme family consists of four genes (HINT1, HINT2, HINT3, and APTX) in humans. HINT1 could hydrolyze the phosphoramide bond of AMP-lysine (Bieganowski et al. 2002) and moreover the bisamidate nucleotide prodrug PSI-7851 (Murakami et al. 2010). In addition, APTX was also found to have the same AMP-lysine phosphoramidase activity (Seidle et al. 2005). Therefore, we included these four HINT family genes as candidate genes for R-134450 in addition to SMPDL3A, although none of ELA2, should play an important role in determining the CS-917 amount in the liver, and CTSA and CES1 would be an important factor for R-125338 concentration in the liver. Elastases belong to the serine protease family. In humans, six elastase genes (elastase 1 (ELA1), ELA2, ELA2A, ELA2B, ELA3A, and ELA3B) are known. ELA1 is expressed in skin keratinocytes (Kawashima et al. 1992;Talas et al. 2000). ELA2, also known as neutrophil elastase or leukocyte elastase, is expressed in bone marrow myelocytic precursor cells, mostly promyelocytes (Fouret et al. 1989;Lee and Downey 2001). ELA2A, ELA2B, ELA3A, and ELA3B are known as pancreatic elastases, which are expressed and stored as an inactive zymogen in the pancreas, secreted into the intestine, activated by trypsin and participate in food digestion (Hartley and Shotton 1971;Shen et al. 1987;Tani et al. 1988;Fouret et al. 1989). Although the elastase was defined as a protease which degrades elastin, ELA3A and ELA3B are known to have a slight elastolytic activity but do have protease activity with preferential cleavage after alanine (Bode et al. 1989). The partial structure around the hydrolyzed ester of CS-917 was alanine ethyl ester, which supported ELA3B as the CS-917 esterase. It was reported that mature ELA3A/ELA3B had a molecular weight of 30 kDa and highly concentrated ELA3A/ELA3B showed rapid autolysis (Mallory and Travis 1975), which suggested that the 17 and 15 kDa identified as ELA3B by mass spectrometry would be its autodigested products (Fig. 2B). All of the data were consistent with ELA3B as one of the CS-917 esterases in the small intestine.",

This enzyme has three distinctive enzymatic activities: (1) peptidase activity optimal at pH 5.0 and (2) esterase and (3) deamidase activity optimal at pH 7.0 (Jackman et al. 1990). Besides its catalytic activities, it plays an important role in stabilizing lysosomal b-galactosidase and neuraminidase by its association. Interestingly, this protective function is independent of its catalytic activities (Galjart et al. 1991). CTSA is synthesized as a precursor of 54 kDa which is proteolytically processed into a mature two-chain form of 32 and 20 kDa polypeptides linked by disulfide bridges. This agrees well with the observations that the 26 and 17 kDa bands under a reducing condition (Fig. 2D) correlated well with CS-917 esterase activity on SDS-PAGE gels and were all identified as CTSA by mass spectrometry.",

One study using a yeast 2-hybrid system reported that SMPDL3A interacts with the tumor suppressor gene deleted in the bladder cancer chromosome region 1 (DBCCR1) (Wright et al. 2002), and another study demonstrated SMPDL3A expression is regulated by liver X receptors (LXRs) (Noto et al. 2012). We found that the protein has one predicted phosphohydrolase domain (COG1409, NCBI), where the phosphoramidase reaction is similar to the phosphohydrolase reaction. mRNA expression of human SMPDL3A was high in the skin, small intestine, colon, rectum, liver, kidney, and prostate but low in other tissues, including blood vessels, which was consistent with the observation of the R-134450 phosphoramidase activity profile (data not shown). All experimental data supported that SMPDL3A was the enzyme responsible for R-134450 phosphoramidase activity. Hint3 APTX Figure 7. Specific R-134450 phosphoramidase activity of candidate genes. Candidate genes (SMPDL3A, HINT1, HINT2, HINT3, and APTX) and the negative control (EGFP) were expressed in the human cell line, the recombinant proteins were purified using fused FLAG-tag, and the R-134450 phosphoramidase activity was tested. The purified proteins were quantified by Western blotting, and the specific activity was calculated. Four to seven independent experiments were conducted (4 for HINT1, HINT2, HINT3, and APTX, and 7 for EGFP and SMPDL3A). The results are expressed as the means AE SD (three technical replicates from a single experiment). EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. We have identified SMPDL3A as an R-134450 phosphoramidase, which is thought to be a rate-limiting enzyme for CS-917 activation (Erion et al. 2005;Dang et al. 2007). We deduced that SMPDL3A, not HINT1, is the major R-134450 phosphoramidase in vivo because of the reasons below: (1) The enzyme activity formed a single peak in all purification steps, which suggested the enzyme in the monkey liver was unique; (2) Only SMPDL3A showed relatively strong specific activity compared to HINT family proteins; (3) We tested the R-134450 phosphoramidase activity of two isoforms of SMPDL3B, the most homologous protein to SMPDL3A, but they did not show any R-134450 phosphoramidase activity (data not shown) because homologous drug metabolism enzymes often have similar enzyme activity. To determine whether SMPDL3A is the major enzyme responsible for R-134450 phosphoramidase activity, further studies are needed. For example, a neutralizing antibody against SMPDL3A can be used for such experiments. Moreover, investigation of the relationship between SMPDL3A and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of CS-917 will reveal the importance of SMPDL3A in CS-917 activation.",

Neutrophil elastase (ELA2) was also described to have the esterase activity for PSI-7851 (Murakami et al. 2010) and we identified ELA3B as CS-917 esterase. Therefore, the first step reaction of CS-917 was found to be similar to those nucleotide prodrugs. On the other hand, HINT1 (Murakami et al. 2010(Murakami et al. , 2014 or an unidentified enzyme (Saboulard et al. 1999;Birkus et al. 2011) or acid-driven hydrolysis (Birkus et al. 2011) was described for the second hydrolysis of the P-N bond for prodrugs, which was different from SMPDL3A in CS-917. Thus, SMPDL3A would be the first identified phosphoramidase other than the HINT family enzymes. Saboulard et al. (1999) reported that anti-HIV prodrug phosphoramidase from rat liver was enriched in a cytosolic fraction and that its observed molecular weight was 50-100 kDa. These data agree well with the characteristics of SMPDL3A, but not with HINT1 or APTX. Thus, SMPDL3A might be the unreported phosphoramidase for the anti-HIV prodrug.",

            "text": "Technical limitations of this study were to use monkey tissue as starting materials for purification, and the potential to bias activities observed toward a more stable enzyme by a biochemical purification approach. However, many enzymes were discovered through this approach, especially the discovery of unforeseen enzymes, and once we identify the candidates, we could validate the candidates by the following experiments using human samples. Human recombinant protein experiments (Figs. 3, 7) in this study are the initial step, and correlation analysis between inter-individual enzyme activity and candidate proteins, a selective inhibitor experiment and gene knockout animal experiment would follow for the purpose. In the purification scheme, recovery of enzyme activities at the early purification steps showed more than 100%. This is not an uncommon observation as we reported previously (Yonesu et al. 2011) and as written by others (Ryan 1996), indicating a presence of inhibitors of the enzyme reaction in crude samples. With regard to identification strategy, CES1 and CTSA can be expected as a CS-917 esterase, ELA3B could be speculated based on the activity of ELA2 for PSI-7851 (Murakami et al. 2010), however identification of SMPDL3A as an R-134450 phosphoramidase was completely unexpected because SMPDL3A was very far from the HINT family proteins which have only been reported as having phosphoramidase activity. Recent advancement of proteomics technology has made the requirements to identify candidate proteins much lower than before. We did not have to purify candidate proteins to homogeneity. Instead, in this study, we identified candidate proteins from faint bands of a nanogram level which correlated with enzyme activity (Figs. 2, 6) or even without SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 5) by using a quantitation method by mass spectrometry. Recently, we reported the carboxymethylene butenolidase homolog (CMBL) as a hydrolase of a new antihypertensive drug, olmesartan medoxomil, by the same strategy (Ishizuka et al. 2010), where the identified protein was also completely unexpected. The classical biochemical approach with cuttingedge proteomics technology could contribute to identify enzymes beyond our limited imagination.",

Nevertheless, this study would be an important, initial, and necessary step for a better understanding of the activation mechanism, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of this new drug candidate and possibly other phosphoramidate pro- drugs. Novel identification of new phosphoramidase, which could be responsible for the activation process of other bisamidate drugs, would contribute to research and development of this class of prodrugs in the future. In addition, this study would be another good example showing that our biochemical approach with proteomics technology is an efficient strategy to identify unexpected metabolic enzymes, which are supposed to be necessary in the personalized medicine era.",

As activating enzymes in the first step, we purified and identified CTSA and ELA3B from the monkey small intestine. We also found ELA2 had relatively weak CS-917 esterase activity. Based on the fact that homogenates from only one specific monkey showed high CS-917 esterase activity derived from ELA3B (Figs. 2,4) and the immunodepletion experiment ( Fig. S5), CTSA was probably the major responsible enzyme for CS-917 esterase activity in the small intestine. In addition, we have revealed that CES1 could contribute as CS-917 esterase as well as CTSA in the liver.",

CS-917 that escaped from those enzymes in the small intestine would be hydrolyzed by CTSA and CES1 in the liver, which is the target organ of CS-917. CS-917 hydrolyzed before reaching the liver would hardly contribute to the drug action of CS-917, because R-134450 is hydrophilic and has a low transition between organs due to its low membrane permeability. CS-917 esterase activity in human plasma was very weak compared to that in the small intestine or liver (data not shown), which indicated ELA2 was a minor factor in CS-917 metabolism. Taken together, ELA3B and CTSA, not Figure 6. Purification and identification or R-134450 phosphoramidase activity from monkey liver. R-134450 phosphoramidase activity was purified from monkey liver by ammonium sulfate precipitation and successive five-step chromatography. Fractions of the third (A), fourth (B) and final (C) purification step were subjected to SDS-PAGE and the gel was stained by a fluorescent dye. Bands of 50 kDa correlating well with the enzyme activity are indicated by arrowheads. The bands indicated by open arrowheads were cut and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Enzyme activity of the fractions (solid line) and the intensities of the arrowed bands in the above panel (bars) are shown in the third (D), fourth (E) and final (F) purification step. Boxed fractions were subjected to the next purification step. Three independent experiments were conducted, and the average of technical duplicates from a representative single experiment is shown with error bars representing the higher value.

The monkey small intestine was minced and homogenized in 9 volumes of 10 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.0, including 0.25 mol/L sucrose (homogenate buffer). The homogenate was centrifuged at 600g for 10 min and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of the homogenate with homogenate buffer (nucleus). The supernatant was centrifuged at 8000g for 10 min and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of the supernatant with homogenate buffer (mitochondria). The supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000g for 60 min and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of the supernatant with homogenate buffer (microsome). The supernatant was collected as cytosol. In addition, a part of the homogenate was sonicated and centrifuged at 105,000g for 60 min. The supernatant was collected as soluble fraction and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of the homogenate with homogenate buffer (insoluble fraction). The data are shown as the average of duplicates with error bars representing the minimum and maximum values.  Figure S3. Esterase activity of ELA2A and ELA2B. Recombinant human ELA2A and ELA2B were purified and subjected to esterase assay using Suc-AAPL-PNA as substrate with or without prior activation by trypsin.
