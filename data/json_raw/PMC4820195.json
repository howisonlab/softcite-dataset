Data were gathered from all disabled health care professionals suffering from invalidity of category II or III who were identified in the research among all health care professionals at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana and who were employed there in the period between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2010. Each employee obtained a questionnaire composed of three standardized international questionnaires. Results. There were 248 disabled workers of the II. and III. category of invalidity among the participants. Disabled sickness present reported to have more chronic diseases than disabled non-sickness present (OR = 57.0; 95% CI = 24.4-133.2), lower salary when on sick leave (OR = 13.1; 95% CI = 5.7-30.2) and poor self-rated health (OR = 5.8; 95% CI = 2.7-12.3). Conclusions. The prerequisite for sickness presence among disabled workers is their chronic bad health. It is also formally recognized with the degree of disability. Economic factors are among the most important to direct disabled workers towards sickness presence. The results indicate that workplaces are not adapted to disabled workers in regard to their limitations. IZVLE\u010cEK Klju\u010dne besede: prezentizem, zdravstveni delavci, invalidi Namen.

            "text": "The assessment of workers' health is usually carried out by the following indicators: injuries at work, occupational diseases, sick leave and disability. Most frequently, sick leave is used, which represents temporary absence from work due to disease and/or injury (1). However, in 2000 a new phenomenon defined as sickness presence started to be researched. Sickness presence is the presence of workers at work when they feel so sick that they could be on sick leave (2)(3)(4)(5)(6). The data on sick leave show that 30-40% of employees were not on sick leave during a one--year period observed (7,8). A varied group ranging from employees who are actually healthy and do not have any health-related problems to those who feel sick but work nevertheless belong to this group. The latter are supposed to have a lower social status, fixed-term employment or are threatened with dismissal from work, more demanding and responsible work, can arrange work by themselves and those who have low possibility of replacement at work (2,3,6,(8)(9)(10)(11). The researchers estimate that there are higher odds for sickness presence in educational and medical institutions (2,8). It is described that the level of sickness presence among health care professionals is associated with time pressure (8,9,12,13), lack of personnel or the inability to replace a co-worker at work (8,12), work experience and (dis)satisfaction with work (13).",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to deal with sickness presence in the disabled. The response of the disabled workers was higher than that of all health care professionals, amounting to 57.6% (21). The share of sickness present disabled workers was larger than we could have expected in comparison to the results of the studies among health care professionals and among public employees, where the share of sickness present ranges between 18% and 65% (2-5, 12, 21). The share was higher than expected especially because the operative part of the decision of the invalidity commission that relieves the workers of some of the work enables the disabled to carry out work in accordance with their remaining psychophysical abilities and consequently they are not supposed to \"work when sick\". The observed groups of the disabled of invalidity categories II and III, including both sickness present and non-sickness present, do not differ in terms of sex and age, but they do differ in the following characteristics: disabled workers -sickness present with chronic diseases have higher odds for sickness presence in comparison with disabled workers -non-sickness present. They primarily suffer from mental and behavioral as well as musculoskeletal disorders. When they are really sick, people start to behave differently due to the following reasons: the changed economic circumstances together with the economic crisis after 2009 and a decreased likelihood of permanent employment with the possibility of dismissal and a decrease in salary during sick leave. A significant decrease in sick leave was observed in the area of mental and behavioral disorders at the level of the entire state, and we believe that it is this decrease that indicates sickness presence (22). Mental and behavioral disorders have also been presented in other studies as one of the main causes of sickness presence (23,24). Disabled workers -sickness present enumerate more medical conditions than disabled workers -non-sickness present, and, consequently, they experience their health as poor and they are on sick leave more often. Despite the fact that the disabled workers should be assigned to a suitable workplace due to chronic damage to health, they often say they work while sick. Indirectly, a question can be posed whether the workplace is really suitable as regards the disability assessment (25). A new workplace should suit the worker's remaining psychophysical abilities. Sickness present disabled workers report higher physical and psychical workloads than disabled workers -non-sickness present. Contrary to expectations, they also have to replace their co-workers more often than disabled workers -non-sickness present, although their invalidity status prohibits that explicitly.",

Among them, the sickness present represents the majority despite the fact that all disabled workers with a formal invalidity decision are relieved of some work in accordance with their diagnosis. It is obvious that besides chronic diseases, economic risk factors represent the greatest risk for sickness presence among disabled workers. It would therefore be sensible to invest money in work-oriented rehabilitation and re-training of the disabled in such a way as to increase their chances of employment in a suitable workplace that would be adapted to their specific needs. This is how their economic vulnerability would be decreased. Presently, the disabled workers as well as employers are not particularly motivated towards education. Disabled workers of category II or III frequently become disabled workers of category I and thus a burden on the Pension and Disability Insurance Institute; they can even become unemployed, which represents an even greater risk for the deterioration of their health status.",
