            "text": "Increased morbidity and mortality associated with ischemic heart failure (HF) in type 2 diabetic patients requires a deeper understanding of the underpinning pathogenetic mechanisms. Given the implication of microRNAs (miRNAs) in HF, we investigated their regulation and potential role. miRNA expression profiles were measured in left ventricle biopsies from 10 diabetic HF (D-HF) and 19 nondiabetic HF (ND-HF) patients affected by nonend stage dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy. The HF groups were compared with each other and with 16 matched nondiabetic, non-HF control subjects. A total of 17 miRNAs were modulated in D-HF and/or ND-HF patients when compared with control subjects. miR-216a, strongly increased in both D-HF and ND-HF patients, negatively correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction. Six miRNAs were differently expressed when comparing D-HF and ND-HF patients: miR-34b, miR-34c, miR-199b, miR-210, miR-650, and miR-223. Bioinformatic analysis of their modulated targets showed the enrichment of cardiac dysfunctions and HF categories. Moreover, the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway was activated in the noninfarcted, vital myocardium of D-HF compared with ND-HF patients, indicating a dysregulation of the hypoxia response mechanisms. Accordingly, miR-199a, miR-199b, and miR-210 were modulated by hypoxia and high glucose in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells cultured in vitro. In conclusion, these findings show a dysregulation of miRNAs in HF, shedding light on the specific disease mechanisms differentiating diabetic patients. Diabetes 61:1633-1641, 2012 A variety of clinical conditions can trigger ventricle remodeling, leading to chamber dilatation and heart failure (HF). In particular, myocardial infarction results in a number of structural changes involving both the infarcted and noninfarcted zones (1). A link between hyperglycemia and HF is recognized, and diabetes is an HF risk factor independent of coronary artery disease or hypertension (2). After myocardial infarction, diabetic patients have an increased HF risk and, once HF develops, diabetic patients have a poorer prognosis (3,4). Moreover, diabetic patients display increased morbidity and mortality upon cardiac surgery (5).",

            "text": "Several findings support the notion that increased incidence of ischemic HF occurs in diabetic patients even in the absence of larger infarct size, lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), or reduced infarct artery patency (6,7). The mechanisms leading to a greater burden of HF in diabetic patients after infarction are likely multifactorial, including increased comorbidities (e.g., coronary artery disease and hypertension), more severe atherosclerosis, endothelial and microvascular dysfunction, and deregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Recent studies show that hyperglycemia can cause apoptotic cardiomyocyte loss, which in turn may play a key role in diabetic cardiac damage (8,9). However, the molecular mechanisms by which diabetes contributes to worsening ischemic HF remain unclear.",

However, analyzed samples mostly were derived from endstage patients, potentially missing important determinants of HF progression. Moreover, many discrepancies can be observed among the different studies, possibly as a result of the lack of standardized protocols, the small numbers of patients analyzed, and the high degree of variability in expression levels among patients.

TaqMan Low Density miRNA arrays (Applied Biosystems), containing quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays for 365 human mature miRNAs, were performed using 100 ng total RNA as indicated by the manufacturer. Samples were normalized according to the median cycle threshold (Ct) value. Relative miRNA expression was calculated with the 2 -DDCt method. miRNAs with a Ct #33 and a DDCt $ |1| in at least one of the three comparisons were further analyzed. Data distribution was evaluated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test.

Adjusted P , 0.05 was considered statistically significant. mRNA profiling. Gene expression profiles were measured using Affymetrix GeneChips Human Gene 1.0ST arrays in 7 D-HF, 11 ND-HF, and 5 CTR subjects. Total RNA (100 ng) was analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using the class comparison between-groups function of BRB-ArrayTools (Richard Simon and BRB-ArrayTools Development Team). Since our arrays have a small number of samples per class, differentially expressed genes were evaluated using the random variance version of the two-sample t test, as suggested by the BRB-ArrayTools user manual. The class comparison function also performs random permutations of the class labels, recomputing the random variance t tests of each gene for each random permutation. False discovery rate was computed per gene using the Benjamini and Hochberg (24) method. Differentially modulated genes were identified using the random variance version of the twosample t test, with P , 0.001 and false discovery rate ,0.05 as significance thresholds. The complete dataset of our study is available from the National IPA was used to analyze the molecular pathways and functions enriched among the differentially expressed mRNA (far right branch). For the miRNAs identified by class comparison, target mRNAs were predicted by dedicated software. Next, predicted target datasets were intersected with significantly modulated mRNAs deriving from class comparison analysis. Only miRNA/mRNA couples displaying inverse significant correlations were selected (purple) and further analyzed by IPA."

Thus, we asked whether TGF-b may trigger miR-216a expression in the heart as well. While miR-216a is barely detectable in isolated mouse cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts (not shown), it was readily detectable in human endothelial cells. Upon TGF-b stimulation of these cells, we found that miR-216a expression was significantly induced in a dosedependent ( Fig. 2D) and time-dependent (not shown) fashion, suggesting that TGF-b may play a similar role in HF. miRNA deregulation in the border zone. We tested whether miRNA expression differences observed in the myocardial portion remote from the infarction region were also present in the border zone (i.e., in the myocardial portion around the scar tissue formed after the infarction). We found that all tested miRNAs were similarly dysregulated in the remote zone and in the border zone (not shown). It is intriguing that miR-216a increase was even higher in the border than in the remote zone (D-HF = 65 6 3.8 and ND-HF = 49 6 2.5 vs. CTR, P , 0.0001, for both). We also found that most expression differences between D-HF and ND-HF patients were attenuated in the border zone ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2). For miR-34b, miR-34c, miR-210, and miR-199b, the expression differences were not due to less severe dysregulation in diabetic patients but, rather, to the opposite; indeed, expression levels for these miRNA were induced in ND-HF as well. Likewise, miR-223 decrease in the border zone was attenuated for both D-HF and ND-HF, in keeping with the less pronounced miR-223 downmodulation in D-HF than in ND-HF, as observed in the remote zone (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, at least for the analyzed miRNAs, the dysregulations observed only in diabetic patients when the remote myocardium was analyzed were found in the border zone of both patient classes.

To investigate the functional implications of miRNA dysregulations identified in both D-HF and ND-HF patients, we tested their impact on the transcriptome.",

Several interesting network functions were enriched significantly in the D-HF group compared with the ND-HF group, such as the cardiovascular system development and function (Table 3). It is remarkable that IPA analysis also revealed a significant association of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathway to the mRNAs modulated in the D-HF group. In addition, a significant association of the transmembrane potential of mitochondria decrease and notch signaling pathway to the D-HF mRNAs was found (Table 3). Gene interaction and pathway analysis of miRNA target genes. To investigate the specific functional impact of miRNA-dependent gene expression deregulation, IPA analysis was performed considering only predicted miRNA target genes displaying an inverse correlation with their corresponding miRNA (Supplementary Table 3). This analysis identified several interesting functions, canonical pathways, toxic functions, and toxic lists significantly enriched for the ND-HF or D-HF versus CTR groups (Table 3). Most of these categories were enriched in both HF groups. However, other functions were associated with the D-HF versus CTR group only (e.g., free radical scavenging, oxidative stress, cardiac damage, cardiac dysfunction, cardiac fibrosis, and HF) (Table 3), suggesting the involvement of the identified miRNAs in these events. The low number of targets correlating with D-HF versus ND-HF miRNAs precluded IPA analysis. Activation of the HIF signaling pathway in D-HF patients. HIF signaling pathway enrichment among genes modulated comparing D-HF with ND-HF patients appeared particularly significant, since one of the modulated miRNAs, miR-210, is a known HIF-1a target (26). Thus, the activation of the HIF pathway was investigated further in HF biopsies by qRT-PCR. We found that HIF-1a mRNA levels were increased in the remote myocardium of D-HF patients compared with ND-HF patients, while the other members of the HIF family, HIF-2a and HIF-3a, were not modulated (Fig. 5A). This HIF-1a increase appeared functionally relevant since it was associated with higher levels of HIF target genes (Fig. 5A). miR-199a, miR-199b, and miR-210 modulation by hypoxia and high glucose. These findings prompted us to investigate whether hypoxia was a significant stimulus regulating HF miRNA expression.

However, we also found that high glucose strongly modified hypoxia response, since miR-199a and miR-199b downmodulation was prevented in endothelial cells (changes not significant) (Supplementary Table 4) and inverted in cardiomyocytes: Fig. 5B shows that the combination of hypoxia and high glucose led to miR-199a and miR-199b induction.",

For the first time, we compared D-HF and ND-HF patients with similar functional impairment, identifying a subset of miRNAs that were specifically dysregulated in D-HF, in ND-HF, or in both. It is interesting that some of these miRNAs were previously identified as dysregulated in a variety of heart disease studies performed in humans, as summarized in Supplementary Table 5. One limitation of this study is the low number of female patients recruited, which did not allow us to determine the possible effects of sex.",

Accordingly, several miR-216a-predicted targets (Supplementary Fig. 3) are involved in heart diseases. PDE4D, an miR-216a-predicted target downmodulated in HF patients, is one of the isoforms of the enzyme that hydrolyzes and inactivates cAMP and finely tunes cAMP levels in different cardiomyocyte subcellular compartments. Inactivation of PDE4D potentiates epinephrine-evoked (32) or exercise-induced arrhythmias in mice and the development of cardiomyopathy, increasing mortality after cardiac infarction (33). Another miR-216a target is CAV2, a member of the caveolin family of scaffolding proteins, which regulates signal transduction pathways and lipid metabolism. Loss of caveolin expression results in the activation of a program of progressive hypertrophy in cardiac myocytes, and their deletion results in severe cardiomyopathy (34). Thus, the inhibitory activity of miR-216a on the expression of these transcripts could be deleterious for the cardiac activity. Moreover, ventricular myocytes from the infarcted myocardium overexpress TGF-b protein and mRNA (35), and TGF-b is particularly overexpressed in myocardium during transition from stable hypertrophy to HF (29). We found that TGF-b induced miR-216a expression increase in endothelial cells. In view of these findings, the release of TGF-b from myocytes after infarction and/or during transition to HF may be the cause for the miR-216a expression increase in HF patients.",

In keeping with our data, Lu et al.

When miR-199a and miR-199b levels were examined in cultured cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, the levels were decreased by hypoxia as expected (26,42). However, the concomitant stimulus of high glucose prevented this decrease, and miR-199a and miR-199b levels were actually induced in cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia and high glucose.

Paradoxically, increased oxidative stress may also contribute to the dampening of HIF activation after ischemia (50). In this respect, PARK7, a predicted miR-210 target downregulated in HF diabetic patients and a ubiquitous redox-responsive cytoprotective protein (51), may be particularly important. Among the multitude of genes modulated by HIF-1a, miR-210 can be considered a \"master\" miRNA of hypoxic response (26). It is not clear whether miR-210 activation in the noninfarcted myocardial region represents an adaptive or a maladaptive mechanism. PARK7 targeting suggests that miR-210 induction may be detrimental. However, we and others have found that miR-210 protected endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes from apoptosis (25,52,53), highlighting a possible protective role of miR-210 in D-HF.",

The balance and the interaction between these two dynamic forces ultimately determine how the pathology will evolve. We identified a subset of miRNAs that are specifically dysregulated in D-HF. Gene expression analysis strongly implicated them in the pathogenetic disease mechanisms. Future investigations of the deregulated miRNA actions and functions will substantially improve our understanding of diabetic cardiac and vascular complications."
