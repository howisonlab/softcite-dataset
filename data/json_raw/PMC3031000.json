Vaccinated subjects were recruited from highly vaccinated regions (\u2265 60%), Seoul and Incheon whereas control subjects were recruited from Jeju Island where vaccination rates are low (< 15%). NP swabs were obtained from 400 children aged 18-59 months. Serotype and antibiotic susceptibility was analyzed. Pneumococcal carriage rate was 18.0% (36/200) and 31.5% (63/200) for the vaccinated and control group, respectively. Among those vaccinated, 41.7% (15/36) of the serotypes were vaccine-related type (VRT: 6A, 6C, 19A) with the most common serotype 6C. The next common type was non-typable/non-capsule 30.6% (11/36) followed by non-vaccine type 16.7% (6/36) and vaccine type (VT) serotypes were found in only 11.1% (4/36). In contrast, 52.4% (33/63) of the isolates in the control group were VT. Resistance rates for penicillin and erythromycin were lower in the vaccine group (vaccine vs control; penicillin 45.2% vs 71.4%, erythromycin 74.2% vs 90.5%, P < 0.05). Multi-drug resistance was also lower in vaccinated subjects (vaccine vs control; 45.2% vs 69.8%, P < 0.05). PCV7 reduces carriage in VT which leads to replacement of pneumococci by antibiotic susceptible VRT or non-vaccine type strains."

            "text": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is an important cause of meningitis, pneumonia, and bacteremia, especially among young children and older adults (1). Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were developed to prevent invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD), and after the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, Prevenar \u00ae , Pfizer Inc, Philadelphia, PA, USA), a substantial decrease in incidence of IPD has been reported in the target population of age < 5 yr (2). PCV7 also showed a herd effect among non-vaccinated populations by reducing nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization and trans-mission of vaccine-type (VT) pneumococci from vaccinated children (3). Since NP carriage serves as the reservoir of pneumococcal transmission in the community and is the immediate source of IPD in the host (4), many studies have been done about the impact of PCV7 on NP pneumococcal carriage rate (5,6).",

            "text": "Up to date, there are few studies about impact of PCV7 to pneumococcal carriage in Asia. This is the first study of pneumococcal carriage among vaccinated children in Korea. We evaluated the impact of PCV7 on NP pneumococcal carriage by comparing differences in carriage rates, pneumococcal serotypes and antibiotic sensitivity between fully vaccinated (3 dose primary series + 1 booster dose) and non-vaccinated control children aged 18-59 months attending daycare centers in Korea. The overall NP pneumococcal carriage rate was higher in the control group compared with the vaccinated group. We also found a significant difference in serotypes according to vaccination status. The carriage rate in the vaccinated population for VT strains was lower compared with control subjects. Also, changes in serotype distribution were seen in comparison with previous studies on pneumococcal carriage in Korea, which were done before the introduction of PCV7 throughout 1998-2001 (13,14). VT serotypes were approximately 46.6% and 56.9% of the pneumococcal serotypes in those previous studies; these results are similar with the control subjects in this study (52.4%), however a decrease in VT was seen among the vaccinated subjects (11.1%). Changes in serotype distribution such as decrease in VT in vaccinated populations and increase in prevalence of serotypes not covered by the vaccine has been previously reported in other countries also (15)(16)(17). These studies reported decrease in VT with an increase in NVT, and stationary prevalence of VRT in vaccinated subjects. The explanation of this finding is based on the hypothesis that PCV7 provides protection against VRT serotypes. However recent reports have shown an increase of VRT including Pn 6C and 19A in NP carriage and IPD isolates (18,19). Also, it has been stated that PCV7 does not elicit functional antibodies against Pn 19A in infants (20). In this study, we found a higher proportion of VRT isolated in the vaccinated group compared with the control group, with Pn 6C as the most prevalent serotype among the vaccinated subjects. These results are consistent with the recent epidemiologic data questioning the extent of PCV7 cross-protection for particular VRT serotypes such as Pn 6C and 19A.",

Following the discovery of serotype 6C, the presence of a new serotype, 6D was proposed but was not found in nature until recently (21). The two 6D isolates described here were found to be 6D based on serologic, genetic, and biochemical characterization (9). Serotype 6D was also recently discovered in Fiji (12). In that study, 86% (12/14) of the subjects from which serotype 6D was isolated, had received at least 1 dose of PCV-7. However, in our study, serotype 6D was detected in children who had no history of vaccination and lived in an area where PCV7 vaccination coverage is low (under 15%). To fully understand the epidemiologic features and characteristics of 6D, further studies will be needed on isolates from sterile sites (IPD), otitis media and NP carriage from different regions.",

A previous report of pneumococcal NP carriage before introduction of PCV7 in Korea showed 8% (6/73) of NT isolates (13). Pneumococcal NP carriage serotype acquisition is a complex process with various determinants including age of host, pressure from environment, antibiotics, epidemics, vaccination, capsular switching, competition for predominant serotype or other yet undefined selective forces (22). Up to date there are more than 93 distinct pneumococcal serotypes which are increasing with the development in new methods for detection and serotyping (10,23,24). Isolates lacking a capsule rarely cause invasive disease in humans and are attenuated in virulence in animal models of disease (25), however close monitoring on the epidemiologic changes in serotypes of clinical diseases including IPD and otitis media will reveal the significance of this increase in NT/NC isolates.",

However it is difficult to estimate the impact of these regional differences or differences in background coverage rates on the carriage rate and serotype distribution. Nonetheless, these factors should be considered in interpretation of the data. Despite these limitations, through a multicenter, prospective observational study, we studied the effect of PCV7 on pneumococcal NP carriage by comparing the differences in carriage rates, pneumococcal serotypes and antibiotic sensitivity between vaccinated children and non-vaccinated controls. This study gives an insight of the impact of PCV7 on the epidemiology of pneumococcal NP carriage in Korean children. With the impressive reduction in carriage of VT serotypes in vaccinated subjects, and considering the high antibiotic resistance rates of these strains, we find that pneumococcal protein conjugate vaccines reduce transmission of these serotypes in the community. Also, the most prevalent serotypes among the vaccinated subjects were VRT and NT/NC. The epidemiologic features regarding the prominent serotype in a community is determined by various environmental factors. PCV7 was introduced in Korea in late 2002 and is still vaccinated on a private sector basis. Continuous monitoring on serotype changes of NP carriage as well as isolates from IPD will be important in making decisions on the national immunization strategy."

Therefore with the increase in vaccination of PCV7, decrease in proportion of VT serotypes might lead to a decrease in antibiotic resistance for pneumococcal strains.",

Samples were collected only a single time from each subject and subjects were recruited throughout summer, autumn and early winter seasons. Pneumococcal carriage rates have been reported to show a significant difference between summer and winter months (28). Considering NP colonization is not a constant process, and pneumococcal isolates and serotypes can differ at different periods of time, a time sequenced sample collection study might give us a better understanding of the local epidemiology. Moreover serotyping was done for a single colony of pneumococcus from each subject. However, pneumococcal serotypes can coexist in the NP of an individual. In studies using methods designed to detect multiple-serotype carriage, the carriage rate for more than one serotype range from 1.3% to 30% (29,30). Although most studies on the impact of PCV on NP carriage report only the dominant serotype, detection of multiple-strain colonization is also warranted. In the antibiotic sensitivity analysis, isolates were classified by according to serotype such as VT, VRT, NVT or NT/NC. However the antibiotic sensitivity was analyzed for only four VT strains and three NVT strains in the vaccination group. The results of these strains showed a distinct disposition, however it is difficult to make conclusions with this limited data. Also, the subjects of the vaccinated group and control group were recruited from different regions in Korea. The reason for this regional difference in recruitment was due to distinct differences in vaccination rates between the regions. There is also a mild difference in climate between the regions.

Among 400 children aged 18-59 months, carriage rate was 18.0% and 31.5% for the vaccinated and control group, respectively. Among those vaccinated, 41.7% of the serotypes were vaccine-related type (VRT: 6A, 6C, 19A) with the most common serotype 6C. The next common type was non-typable/non-capsule 30.6% followed by non-vaccine type 16.7% and vaccine type (VT) serotypes were found in only 11.1%. In contrast, 52.4% of the isolates in the control group were VT. Resistance rates for penicillin and erythromycin were lower in the vaccine group and multi-drug resistance was also lower in vaccinated subjects. We conclude that PCV7 reduces carriage in VT which leads to replacement of pneumococci by antibiotic susceptible VRT or non-vaccine type strains."
