            "text": "The biology of fatigue and depression in cancer patients is poorly understood. Hypotheses regarding cytokines and growth factors related to sickness behavior and disruption of circadian signaling have been proposed. Objectives: We prospectively examined proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., sickness behavior model) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands (e.g., circadian disruption model) in the serum of cancer patients enrolled in a clinical trial testing levocarnitine for fatigue. Methods: Serum samples were collected at baseline and week 4. Cytokine/growth factor analyses were performed with a Luminex analyzer. The Brief Fatigue Index and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Index were used to measure fatigue and depression severity. The association between cytokine and symptoms was examined using logistic models. Results: Among 101 analyzable patients, all ten cytokines/growth factors examined were highly elevated at baseline and all significantly decreased at week 4 (p<0.001) regardless of treatment intervention. At baseline, the odds of severe fatigue significantly increased for patients with higher level of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), whereas patients with higher levels of IL-1Ra, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, interferon-\u03b3, transforming growth factor \u03b1, and vascular endothelial growth factor had higher odds of severe depression. At week 4, fatigue (p=0.023) and depression (p=0.007) responders had less decrease in IL-1 level than the corresponding non-responders. Conclusion: In this correlative analysis of a fatigue clinical trial, levels of fatigue were significantly associated with levels of IL-1 and IL-1Ra. Circadian-signaling pathways related to EGFR signaling were correlated with depression as were other cytokines. A major placebo effect was associated with a global decrease in cytokine and growth factors. These data provide further basis for testing hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of fatigue and depression in cancer patients.",

Clinical factors that may impact the development of fatigue, such as disease progression, depression, poor nutritional status, and treatment, are often considered. The underlying molecular mechanism of fatigue, however, is still poorly understood. Biological factors that have been examined in recent years include cytokine dysregulation, hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis dysfunction, 5 hydroxy tryptophan neurotransmitter dysregulation, circadian rhythm disruption, alterations of muscle metabolism, vagal afferent activation, and genomic factors. 1 Two \"cytokine\" hypotheses regarding the production of fatigue and related symptoms in cancer patients are the focus in this report.",

            "text": "The first is based on the \"sickness behavior model\" 2 that is thought to be related mechanistically to elevation of serum and brain levels of proinflammatory cytokines of the interleukin (IL) family (e.g., IL-1, IL-1Ra, and IL-6). [3][4][5][6][7][8][9] Activation of this cytokine signaling in the peripheral and central nervous system by cancer or cancer treatment has been shown to lead to malaise, poor appetite, and social withdrawal, which are believed to underlie fatigue, cognitive disturbances, and depression. 10,11 The second hypothesis is that symptoms could be due to the inhibition of circadiansignaling pathways. This hypothesis is based on extensive laboratory data 12 showing inhibition of downstream hypothalamic signaling from the master clock in the suprachiasmic nucleus and corroborated by clinical observations. 13 The inhibition of these hypothalamic signaling pathways can produce fatigue, suppress feeding activity, and cause malaise. Elevation of circulating levels of ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1), and neuregulin, 14,15 can act to inhibit neural signaling that drives normal behaviors, in laboratory studies.",

Expression levels were determined following incubation with a biotinylated detection antibody and streptavidinconjugated phycoerythrin (PE). Using a Luminex \u00ae analyzer, independent lasers determined the color of each bead and the magnitude of the PE-derived signal, which was directly proportional to the levels of bound analyte. Samples were given a missing value for cytokines if the levels of cytokines were below the detection level of the kits. Samples with missing values for cytokine levels were excluded from corresponding analysis. Hence, the sample size might vary for different cytokines.

No significant difference in baseline patient characteristics was found except for disproportionately lower overall metastatic disease rate among the 101 patients compared with the remaining 275 patients without cytokine assessment (data not shown). The baseline symptom levels were similar as well (Figure 2A, C). Of the 101 patients with cytokine data, the patient characteristics were well balanced between the levocarnitine and placebo arms except for a lower proportion of males in the levocar-nitine arm (Table 1). Hence, we analyzed the data regarding the symptoms correlated with cytokines on the collapsed population of 101 patients. Table 2 shows a significant decrease in fatigue and depression levels between baseline and week 4. Of the 101 patients, 64.4% had severe fatigue at baseline and 54.0% reported severe fatigue at 4-week assessment. The mean percent change of BFI total score was \u221217.4%, and 16.2% (n=16) of patients had a \u226550% improvement in BFI total scores (fatigue responders).

Certain patient demographic and disease characteristics were found to be associated with higher levels of cytokines in our study, such as metastatic disease, current radiotherapy, and male sex. Performance status per se is not associated with cytokine levels in our study. Consistent with our study hypothesis, higher levels of cytokines appear to be associated with a greater symptom burden (Table 3). At the baseline assessment, a multivariable analysis shows that a high level of IL-1Ra is associated with severe fatigue. This observation is consistent with a study of fatigued breast cancer and prostate cancer survivors. 23 A meta-analysis of over 1000 cancer patients also found that the circulating levels of IL-1Ra and IL-6 are associated with fatigue. 24 In our multivariable analysis for depression, seven (IL-1Ra, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, TGF-\u03b1, and VEGF) of the ten cytokines are significantly associated with severe depression.

Supporting this notion are the results with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib, that showed early reversal of multiple symptoms that are hard to explain solely on the basis of tumor response. 29 Furthermore, in a small pilot trial, we found that the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor did reverse objective measurements of the circadian system with normalization of wrist actigraphy measurements, indicating fatigue in a cohort of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. 30 Future studies with anti-EGFR agents should explore the potential for improvement of symptoms as well as antitumor activity in the quest for better understanding of the interventional potential of this class of agents.",

We show here that fatigue improvement is associated with a decline of the IL-1/IL-1Ra pathway in this population that experience the placebo effect (Table 2), thus contributing to the understanding of fatigue within the emerging knowledge of the importance of neural-chemical pathways in producing placebo effects per se. 32 Although the precise neurochemical mechanism is unknown, the observed placebo effects can be important confounding factors in clinical symptom research. One approach to account for this would be to assess patient's expectations, a dimension that has been shown to influence treatment intervention in studies concerning pain and inflammation. 33 Another way could examine the actual language used by health workers (e.g., certified research assistants and doctors) enrolling patients onto clinical trials that could provide an elevated sense of anticipation that has been shown to influence outcomes positively or negatively (placebo or nocebo, respectively). 32 There are some important limitations for this correlative study. First, only one follow-up was made, at week 4. Multiple evaluations of the cytokine levels at specific times as well as follow-up extended beyond 1 month might be important, given the known circadian variation in these cytokine levels as well as changing trajectory of fatigue over time. Second, various additional variables were not collected (e.g., duration of fatigue before study entry, body mass index, menopausal status of female subjects, sleep problems, concomitant use of sleep aid, nutrition and oxygen status, the type and the timing of chemotherapeutic agents used, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy). Some of these additional variables might mediate the association between cytokines and fatigue. Third, some details about the blood draw (e.g., whether it is collected before taking the study drug intervention) are not explicitly specified in the protocol, which might have an impact on the study results. Fourth, we did not adjust these exploratory analyses for multiple comparisons. Finally, the analyses are underpowered due to the small sample size. Overall, these correlative study data should be considered as exploratory and hypothesis generating.",
