            "text": "Objectives: Despite the increasing utilization of in-home services, the assessment of in-home services used by those that have certified levels of care needs has been limited to the actual changes in individual outcomes. The purpose of the present study was to determine factors affecting how the utilization of in-home services could have sustained and/or improved or deteriorated the care needs levels of frail persons. We also examined the effect of in-home services used in the lower level of care needs subgroup and the higher level of care needs subgroup during a two-year period. Subjects and Methods: We used longitudinal data from Izumo City of those individuals with certified levels of care needs to analyze the changes in care need levels in Izumo City between 2002 to 2004. In 2002, 2,651 persons had certified levels of care needs. All permanent residents of care facilities, at care needs level 5 in 2002, those who died since 2002 and people who could not be traced during the two-year follow-up period were excluded. The remaining data from 1,788 frail persons were ultimately analyzed. We arbitrarily divided the changes in care needs levels into two categories: sustained/improved and deteriorated. The care needs levels were also stratified into a lower level of care needs subgroup and a higher level of care needs subgroup at the baseline. Simple statistical analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to analyze factors that were thought to be related to in-home service utilization data to predict changes in care needs levels. Results: Approximately 63.3% of the respondents had a sustained or improved care needs level, and 36.7% of the respondents showed deteriorated of care needs levels. In the lower level of care needs subgroup, utilization of home help/bathing (OR=2.59) was associated with significant sustained/improved care needs levels. In the higher level of care needs subgroup, day care service (OR=0.90) and short stay services (OR=0.87) were significantly related to deteriorated care needs levels, respectively. Conclusions: This study shows that home help/bathing care in the lower level of care needs subgroup was a significant predictor of sustained/improved levels of care needs for frail persons but that short stay services and day care services in the higher level of care needs subgroup have a negative impact on sustained/improved levels of care needs. Our results suggest that utilization of home help services can prevent deterioration of these levels of care needs in frail persons.",

            "text": "The family's capacity to care for the elderly is weakening because of a changing household structure, an increasing number of working women and an enhanced social security system in Japan. There are 4.884 million people in Japan certified as eligible for the long-term care insurance system. The ratio of those aged 65 and over was 16.9%, and the number of home services users was 2.924 million people in May 2010 1) . Disabilities are associated with a loss of independence, an increased need for health care services and subsequently higher health care costs [2][3][4] . In response to these problems, the public long-term care insurance system (LTCIS) was introduced in 2000 by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which focuses on providing both inhome services (home care) and also services at facilities (institutional care). All persons aged 65 and over are eligible, along with people aged 40 to 64 who have a health-related disability. In-home services have become the fastest growing segment of the Japan LTCIS. They are expected to play a significant role as an effective tool for not only preventing deterioration and improving the disability status for frail persons but also decreasing the burden for family caregivers and improving the lives of those living in the community with certified care needs levels.",

We also examined the effect of in-home services used in the lower level of care needs subgroup and the higher level of care needs subgroup during a two-year period. Studies have been limited by the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of in-home services for frail elderly on changes in levels of care needs such as lower level of care needs and higher level of care needs 6) . Some studies have indicated that in-home services had positive or negative effects on reductions in functional levels. Kato et al. 7) found that use of respite stays in a nursing home, and use of medical management by a physician were significantly related to a deterioration of the user's levels of care needs. On the other hand, Ishibashi et al. 8) demonstrated that the risk of decline in functional status was lower for users of home help services. Moreover, Fukuma and Shiwaku 6) indicated that at the end of tracking of two years, improvement in the care level was related to either levels of care needs or utilization of short stays. A study by Tomita et al. 9) reported that among the types of services, users of respite care and rental services for assistive devices were less likely to be hospitalized or institutionalized than nonusers. Concerning those with relatively light needs, users of day care services were also less likely to be hospitalized or institutionalized than nonusers. Markle-Reid et al. 10) found that a variety of home visiting interventions carried out by nurses can favorably affect health and functional status and mortality rates. However, Stuck et al. 11) used subgroup analysis to reveal that public home-visit nursing can reduce disabilities among elderly people at low risk but not among those at high risk for functional impairment after three years. Other studies, however, indicated that the use of home help services had no effect on reducing functional decline 7,[11][12][13] .",

More than 63.3% of the subjects had a sustained or improved level of care needs, nearly 36.7% of the subjects had a deteriorated level of care needs and more than 18.7% of the subjects had died. Table 2 shows the changes in care needs levels of frail persons with regard to utilization of in-home services. For utilization of in-home services, using of home help/bathing and day care service exhibited statistically significant results and were related to a sustained/improved level of care needs, respectively. About 78% of the subjects used home help/bathing, 71% of the subjects used day care service and 58% of the subjects were using day rehabilitation were associated with significant sustained/improved care needs levels, respectively. In contrast, about 59% of the subjects using short stays in a facility were associated with significant deteriorated care needs levels. Whereas, for 60% of the sub-jects using home-visit nursing and rental service for equipment was associated with no significant stained/improved care needs levels, respectively.",

Frail persons can decide who come to their house and provides care and thery can set home helpers schedule and determine how and when the tasks will be done. Thus, the main focus of long-term care services is on primary prevention of disability for frail persons, and this need has been met especially for those using these services.

This may also be the reason why these services have been focused on family caregivers for those with greater burden or for working fanilies etc. who do not provide informal care. This is supported by the fact that numerous publications have evaluated the effect of short-stay service focusing on outcomes for caregivers, not care recipients 7,17) . Thus, those who used respite care were less likely than nonusers to be hospitalized or institutionalized 9) . This service may reduce the care burden of family caregivers, allowing them to maintain their ability to provide care 9,18) , but so far, most of the users are at either a sustained or improved level of care needs. Regarding effect of program, Brunette et al. 19) indicated that patients in long-term programs had significantly better outcomes than those in short-term programs.

The day service center programs provide basic services to frail persons including meals, transportation, bathing and simple recreation by care workers. We also consider that the number of care workers in day care services is significantly less than those in facilities providing care to frail persons. A care worker ratio of 1:15 was maintained for subjects determined to be frail persons by the LTCS, and sufficient care could not be provided for frail persons to maintain their physical and mental health, especially in the high level of care needs subgroup. Thus, users of day care services were more likely than nonusers to be independent and more likely to be co-performers of activities of daily living with care workers. A sufficient ratio of care workers to frail persons needs to be established to increase the proportion of frail persons who improve or sustain their level of care needs, and it is an important public policy issue.",

Therefore, there exists an urgent need to develop and test the effectiveness of in-home services and strategies designed to improve the level of care needs, or to at least maintain the level of care needs, among frail persons and to determine how well in-home services and other strategies work in both the lower level of care needs and higher level of care needs subgroups.",

The second is to provide respite care for family caregivers, often the children or spouse of the frail persons who are provided home care. Our findings are only preliminary, but they provide further evidence supporting the importance of the effects of the levels of care needs for frail persons using in-home services. Given the pressures to reduce public spending on care of frail persons and a growing desire for in-home services for the elderly, the emphasis on caring for elderly people in their own homes has gained momentum across social welfare systems in the developed world [24][25][26] . In-home services for frail persons are intended to improve the quality of services for improvement or maintenance of the level of care needs, though it is not yet known whether frail persons and their families are able to be appropriate judges of which providers and which kind of in-home services will provide the best type of care.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, we note several limitations of the present study. First, the data did not contain any relevant information regarding the socioeconomic situation of frail persons or family caregivers or the quality of home care service provided. Whether these additional sources of information affect the levels of care needs for frail persons and the categories is an issue that requires further investigation. Sec- ond, generalization of our findings is limited because our data were derived from data for individuals who had applied for LTCI and individuals certified for LTCI among community-dwelling frail persons in a single prefecture. Future studies are needed from another prefecture to confirm our results. Third, our analysis did not have informal services data conserning such thing as the private caregiver situation and support networks because our dataset did not contain these categories. More detailed data on the private services of subjects would be helpful to further clarify the changes in the levels of care needs in later life. Fourth, our study could not identify the effects of using home help service and home visit-bathing had a improved or sustained level of care needs, respectively. Therefore, in the future, the effect of use of a home helper service and home-visit bathing should be investigated to determine whether or not frail persons who are using home help services or visit bathing can sustain their levels of care needs, respectively. Finally, in-home service programs targeting frail persons were not included in our study because the goal of our study was to determine whether or not individuals sustained/maintained their level of care needs, which kinds of home care services were used and whether the intervention consisted of less than four visits per year and/or the duration of the intervention program was shorter than 12 months.",

            "text": "The evidence in this investigation points to the importance of the use of home help or bathing services in maintaining and improving the level of care needs in the lower level of care needs subgroup. Furthermore, in the higher level of care needs subgroup, the use of a short stay and day care service was significantly associated with a retrograded level of care needs. The political and practical problem facing governments is how to achieve financial savings and increase efficiency without reducing the quality of care. By identifying potential ways to maintain or improve level of care needs of frail persons and the utilization of in-home services that are viable from a policy perspective, the present survey should provide a better sense of which in-home services might result in more positive changes in levels of care needs for frail persons. This knowledge may suggest that in-home services contribute to the goal of the long-term care system of preventing deterioration but also that these services may help make things easier for family caregivers in the community and help policy-makers reform in-home services.",
