Material and methods: One group comprised patients with RA and sSS, the control group comprised patients with ra. the inclusion criteria for the ra and sss group have been specified as follows: presence of at least one symptom of dryness, and also presence of anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B or at least focus score of one in biopsy. Results: the disease activity score 28 (das28) was assessed using both esr and crP in 60 patients with ra and sss and 59 patients with ra alone. however, concordance between these two methods was good (cohen's \u03ba coefficient \u03ba = 0.60, 95% ci: 0.45-0.75 in the first group and \u03ba = 0.71, 95% ci: 0.56-0.86 in the control group). in the group with ra and sss, the mean value of das28-esr = 5.2, whereas the mean value of das28-crP = 4.7 (p < 0.0001). in the group with ra alone, mean das28-esr = 4.7 while mean das28-crP = 4.6; no significant difference was identified. moreover, in ra patients with sss, mean esr = 39 mm/h compared with mean crP at 25 mg/l. 79% of all patients demonstrated dysproteinaemia. there were connections between higher esr and dysproteinaemia. in the control group there was no statistically significant difference between crP and esr. Conclusions: Both das28-esr and das28-crP are useful outcome measures in ra. however, in patients with ra and sss, das28 should be evaluated based on crP.",

Moreover, agreement between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP was good; Cohen's kappa coefficient with linear weighting \u03ba = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45-  .75 in the RA and sSS group, and Bland-Altman analysis (Fig. 3) also shows good agreement between both methods.

A relevant difference was identified with p < 0.0001.

            "text": "This study evaluating 60 patients with RA with sSS revealed that values of DAS28-CRP are significantly lower than those of DAS28-ESR. Discrepancies were found in patients with moderate disease activity (DAS28 from 3.2 to 5.1) (DAS28-CRP -30 patients, DAS28-ESR -23 patients) and a high disease activity score (DAS28 above 5.1) (DAS28-CRP -23 patients, DAS28-ESR -33 patients). These observations have implications for clinical evaluations since a high disease activity score qualifies patients for biological treatment. The afore-mentioned findings change the therapeutic approach, hence, this study is aimed to prove that patients with RA and sSS have different outcomes in assessment from DAS28-ESR than from DAS28-CRP and, therefore, evaluations from DAS28-CRP are recommended. In several previous studies [6][7][8][9], DAS28 from CRP and DAS28 from ESR were compared. Fransen et al. [9] reported that not only the DAS28-CRP 4.38 [SD 1.47] and DAS 28 ESR 4.41 [SD 1.27] are similar, but also that CRP could be replaced by ESR. According to Wells et al. [6], most patients were classified as having the same EULAR state regardless of which DAS28 definition has been employed. Moreover, Inoue et al. [8] have shown that DAS28-CRP can be used as an alternative to the DAS28-ESR given the strong linear relationship between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP values (correlation coefficient 0.946) [8]. By contrast, in our research group, the said correlation coefficient is equal to only 0.73. In comparison to his predecessors, Matsui et al. [7] demonstrated that DAS28-CRP significantly underestimated disease activity and overestimated the improvement in disease activity compared with DAS28-ESR. Our study has revealed that the mean value of DAS28-CRP (4.71, SD 1.2) was significantly smaller than the mean value of DAS28-ESR (5.27, SD 1.32) (p < 0.0001) in a group with RA and sSS (Table 1). There were no significant statistical correlations in the control group with RA. Nevertheless, the changes of DAS28 values in DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP in both groups were very similar and closely correlated. Although the values of DAS28-ESR and those of DAS28-CRP were comparable in the reports of Wells et al. [6] and Fransen et al. [9], our study did not show similar results (Table 2).",

In our research, not only patients with RA have undergone examination, but also those with sSS. That syndrome is responsible for changes in immunoglobulin, especially activation of polyclonal B-cell leading to chronic hypergammaglobulinemia and increased levels  of b2-microglobulinemia [10] which affect the ESR and cause higher ESR. Apart from the aforementioned, ESR can also be affected by such factors as sex, age, immunoglobulin levels, and abnormal size or shape of red blood cells. In chronic diseases, the ESR-elevation is considered to be caused by fibrinogen, mono-or polyclonal increase in IgG, IgA, and IgM, alone or in combinations [11]. Normal values of ESR for females are higher than for males and increase with age. Due to the fact that the study group was dominated by women (93%), that factor could possibly have influenced the results.",

            "text": "In an inflammatory process, the high proportion of fibrinogen in the blood causes red blood cells to stick to each other. The red cells form stacks called rouleaux which settle faster in ESR. Fibrinogen is considered to be responsible for the rouleaux phenomenon, however, it has a co-influence on immunoglobulin to induce the rouleaux type of aggregates and high ESR. High ESR is a result of either rouleaux type aggregates where fibrinogen is dominant, or immunologic type aggregates where IgG, IgA or IgM are the dominant proteins [12,13]. On the other hand, total leukocyte and absolute neutrophil counts are not correlated with either ESR or haematocrit standardised ESR. A strong correlation (r = 0.75) was found between fibrinogen levels and haematocrit standardised ESR [14]. In our study this correlation has not been measured. However, in our study polyclonal gammopathy and dysproteinaemia were reported. Serum protein electrophoresis is a laboratory examination that is commonly used to identify two major types of proteins: albumin and globulins. The five components (globulins) are labeled \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 , b 1 , b 2 , and \u03b3. Dysproteinaemia in our study means an abnormality of the protein content of the blood, involving the immunoglobulins (\u03b1, b and \u03b3 globulins). Polyclonal gammopathy can be observed in patients with SS. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and elevated \u03b1 2 -globulins are often seen. In our study 46% of patients demonstrated hypergammaglobulinemia and 69% dysproteinaemia, hence, higher ESR can be determined by this pathology. A retrospective cohort study of 148 patients from the Mayo Clinic showed that in patients with RA, \u03b3 globulin levels are elevated in 37% of patients, and are reported to correlate with disease activity [16]. Our study also revealed that patients with dysproteinaemia have higher ESR, what proved to be a significant correlated factor. Furthermore, ESR tends to show the disease activity over the course of a few weeks, whereas CRP can develop more short-term changes in the disease activity. Moreover, CRP is less dependable on sex, age, and fibrinogen and immunoglobulin levels [15]. Thus, CRP tends to be a better factor than ESR.",
