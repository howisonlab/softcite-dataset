This cross-sectional study enrolled 1926 subjects (769 males and 1157 females) aged 40 to 95 years who underwent a health checkup in a Japanese cohort of the Seven Countries Study, in Tanushimaru, a typical farming town in Kyushu Island in 2009. The subjects' medical history, alcohol intake, smoking habit, and current medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes were ascertained by questionnaire. Radial arterial pressure wave analysis was used to obtain AI. We analyzed the data stratified by gender. Age-adjusted means of AI in males showed a clear dose-response relationship in 4 categories of smoking habits (P = 0.010). There was no significant relationship between AI and smoking habits in females (P = 0.127). The significant dose-response relationship (P = 0.036) in males between AI and 4 categories of smoking habits still remained even after adjustment for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, glucose, hypertensive medication, and alcohol intake. The present study demonstrated that AI values were significantly associated with smoking habits in a dose-dependent manner in Japanese males.

            "text": "Tanushimaru Study is a cohort of the Seven Countries Study, [1] which has begun in 1958. Tanushimaru is a rural farming community located in southwestern Japan. Although the Seven Countries Study ended in 1989, we continued the epidemiologic study in the same district. As previously reported, the demographic backgrounds of the subjects in this area are similar to those of the Japanese general population. [2] During the past 6 decades, lifestyle and eating patterns have been dramatically changes, associated with socioeconomic development, [3] which may affect atherosclerosis development. [4,5] In atherosclerosis progression, inflammation, and immune responses are involved in all layers of the arterial wall, [6] which can cause abnormal vasospastic responses. [7,8] In such situation, arterial stiffness has been a good marker to detect the early stages of atherosclerosis, which is also able to predict coronary artery disease (CAD) events to a larger extent than brachial pulse pressure (PP), not only because it directly influences left ventricular afterload and coronary perfusion, but also because it may partially parallel the extent of coronary atherosclerosis. [9] Arterial stiffness can be noninvasively assessed by measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV), a simple and reproducible method. [10] Different aspects of large artery stiffness at rest in relation to ischemic threshold have been assessed using arterial compliance, distensibility index, and augmentation index (AI). [11] Cigarette smoking is one of the most important causes of cardiovascular diseases acting via oxidative stress, [12] in which it has been demonstrated that smoking increases arterial stiffness, independent of blood pressure (BP). [13,14] Interestingly, smoking cessation more than a decade has been reported to recover arterial stiffness parameters to nonsignificant levels, [13] because smoking cessation reduces the levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and fibrinogen. [15] However, no study has focused on the effects of dose-dependency of current smoking, including smoking cessation, on arterial stiffness using AI in a general population. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether radial AI is associated with smoking habits in a Japanese general population in Tanushimaru Study.",

The nonsmokers were defined as no past or current history of smoking, the former smokers as smoking cessation before the examination, and the current smokers as smoking at least 1 cigarette a day. Height and weight were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kilograms) divided by the square of height (square meters) as an index of obesity. BP was measured in the supine position twice at 3-minute intervals using an upright standard sphygmomanometer. Vigorous physical activity and smoking were avoided for at least 30 minutes before BP measurement. The second BP with the fifth-phase diastolic pressure was used for analysis.",

Obesity is associated with several disorders, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea syndrome. [21,22] In spite of a positive correlation between obesity and increased cardiovascular morbidity, better clinical outcomes in overweight and obese patients have been observed, which is called \"obesity paradox.\" [23] The correlation between AI levels and BMI has been inconsistent. Some were positive, and some were negative. [18][19][20]24,25] Although the previous studies have been done in western countries with high BMI levels (25-27.0 kg/m 2 ), [18,19] we included many healthy subjects with normal BMI levels (23.4 kg/m 2 ), in wide ranges of age from 40 to 95 years old in the present study, which indicated the significant inverse association between AI and BMI. Otsuka et al [25] have shown the significant inverse association of radial AI with BMI using a multivariate analysis. However, the mechanisms and pathophysiology relating AI and BMI are poorly understood.",

[26] Smoking rates in men were 25.8% and those in women were 2.8% in the present study. In this background, our data indicated that AI levels were significantly associated with smoking habits in a dose-dependent manner. Correlations between AI levels and smoking status were found in Japanese and European investigations, [14,27] which are consistent with our study. Although the mechanisms are not still clear, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress may play important roles in the relationship between AI and cigarette smoking. [28,29] Further, the present study indicated a clear dose-response relationship between AI and smoking status in males, in which AI might be increased as a marker of smoking-specific oxidative stress. [29] Although AI levels in former smokers (81.3%) were slightly elevated than those in nonsmokers (81.2%) in this study, former smokers showed an almost normal range of AI levels. By contrast, AI levels between light and heavy smokers seemed to be comparable, suggesting that smoking cessation, but not cutting down, may be favorable to the reduction of oxidative stress, as previously reported. [13,29] As for medications, there is no significant relationship between AI and medications for dyslipidemia and diabetes (Table 4). Because of the strong association of AI with medication for hypertension in males, we analyzed the data after adjustment for the factor in addition to the confounding factors (Fig. 1A). However, the significance still remained.",

Prospective studies are needed to investigate the role of AI in smokers, especially in the aspects of mortality or cardiovascular events. Second, from the multiple correlation coefficients, the significant 6 factors (as shown in Table 6) explained only 5.0% of the variation of AI. Third, we obtained the number of cigarettes by questionnaires, which might not be quantitatively accurate. Moreover, we do not have the detailed data regarding smoking duration. Forth, because the survey conducted in 2009, the data are little old. Finally, although medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes were not correlated with AI levels in our analyses, we were not able to exclude the contributions of some therapeutic agents.",
