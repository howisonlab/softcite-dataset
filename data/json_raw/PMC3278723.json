Circadian rhythms keep track of time and provide temporal regulation with a period of about 24 h. The cell cycle is optimized for growth and division, but not for time keeping. Circadian gated cell divisions are observed in nearly all organisms. However, the implications of this coupling to the physiology of mammals are unknown. A mutation (S662G) in the clock protein PERIOD2 (PER2) is responsible for familial advanced sleep phase syndrome in which sleep onset occurs in the early evening and wakefulness occurs in the early morning. Here, we provide evidence that the PER2 S662 mutation leads to enhanced resistance to X-ray-induced apoptosis and increased E1A-and RAS-mediated oncogenic transformation. Accordingly, the PER2 S662 mutation affects tumorigenesis in cancer-sensitized p53 R172H/ \u00fe mice. Finally, analyzing the clock-controlled cell cycle genes p21, c-Myc, Cyclin D1 and p27, we found that the relative phases between p21 and Cyclin D expression profiles have been changed significantly in these Per2 allele mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts. This key role of the Per2-mediated phase alteration of p21 provides what we believe to be a novel mechanism in understanding cell cycle progression, its plasticity and its resistance to interference."

            "text": "The circadian clock is essential for the maintenance of physiological homeostasis, as well as the coordination of responses to external signals. In mammals, the circadian clock is composed of interlocking positive and negative feedback loops. In the primary feedback loop, three basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/PAS domain-containing transcription factors, Clock, Npas2 and Bmal1, activate the transcription of two period genes (Per1 and Per2) and two cryptochrome (Cry) genes (Cry1 and Cry2) by binding to the E-box cis elements in the promoters of these genes. Subsequently, the PER/CRY complex inhibits the transcription of its own genes by blocking BMAL1/CLOCK activity. The second feedback loop is mediated by the orphan nuclear receptors RORa and Rev-erba. Transcription of RORa and Rev-erba is activated during the day by the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex, after which they exert positive and negative transcriptional effects on the Bmal1 gene through Rev-erba/RORa responsive elements (ROREs) in the Bmal1 promoter. [1][2][3] The circadian system may be tightly connected to many physiological processes through clock-controlled nuclear receptor genes (e.g., PPARa and PPARg) and cell cycle genes (e.g., c-Myc, cyclin D, Wee1 and p21). [5][6][7][8] The links between the circadian clock and a variety of physiological processes are just beginning to be unveiled; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.",

            "text": "Generation of PER2 dose-dependent BAC transgenic mice. As there is a higher level of PER2 in PER2 S662D mice compared with wild-type littermates, 15 it is plausible that PER2 may affect apoptosis through multiple mechanisms. To determine whether increased expression of PER2 compared with wild-type levels is also responsible for the observed resistance to apoptosis, we generated PER2 dosedependent BAC transgenic mice (Figure 2a). These transgenic mice were designed to express cis-acting genomic regulatory elements in a manner that faithfully recapitulates endogenous PER2 expression. We characterized these mice based on their copy number by Southern blot (Figure 2b) and quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR) ( Figure 2c), and then we selected three transgenic lines as low (1-2 copies) (L), middle (2-3 copies) (M) and high copy (4-5 copies) (H). mRNA levels are much higher in the H line than in the PER2 S662D2H in including liver (Figure 2d), spleen (Figure 2e) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) ( Figure 2f), and PER2 protein in H line is more abundant than those from the PER2 S662D mice (Figure 2g). These mice have a circadian period that lengthens as the copy number of Per2 increases (Figure 2h). Mice with four to five copies of the PER2 transgene showed an extreme elongation of the circadian period to 25 h, which is longer than that of the mice with the PER2 S662D mutation (24 h). 15 The PER2 dose dependence of period length suggests that PER2 has a critical role in circadian clock, which is also seen in dorosphila. 18,19 PER2 S662D may elongate the circadian period through the increased PER2 protein level. We noticed that apoptosis rates also decreased in the highcopy mice (28%\u00b10.9), but this decrease is less than that in the PER2 S662G :Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mutant (16.5% \u00b1 0.3), PER2 S662D :Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mutant (9.9% \u00b1 0.05) and Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (15.08%\u00b10.2) (Po0.001) (Figures 3a and b). This suggests that PER2 homeostasis has a role in maintaining a proper apoptosis response. Furthermore, we crossed L-line mice to the Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 background because all results are on a Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 background. The cells from L-line mice displayed comparable levels of apoptosis to those from L line on a Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 background (35.1\u00b10.1 versus 35.2\u00b10.5), to exclude a remote possibility that Per2 -/acts as a dominant negative role. These genetic observations suggest that both the mutational status of PER2 S662 and the levels of PER2 protein may affect the apoptotic response to X-rays.",

A previous study has shown that primary embryo fibroblasts can be immortalized by the expression of at least two oncogenes; for example, E1A, myc and ras. 20 This technique has been used to evaluate whether inactivation or deletion of a tumor suppressor gene can hasten the activation of oncogenes and promote oncogenic transformation. 21 To determine whether the PER2 S662 mutation results in a transformationpermissive phenotype in vitro, PER2 S662G , PER2 S662D , wildtype and Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs were infected with a retroviral vector that co-expressed the oncogenes E1a and Ras. The ability of E1a and Ras to induce cellular transformation was far greater in PER2 S662G mice than in wild-type MEFs, while the level of transformation was comparable to that of Per2 KO MEFs (Figures 4a and b). Furthermore, consistent with the phenotype shown for X-ray-induced apoptosis, PER2 S662D MEFs formed more colonies than PER2 S662G and Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs (Figures 4a and b). Finally, we assessed whether overexpression of wild-type PER2 could trigger cellular transformation. As expected, the MEFs with a high-copy number of Per2 from H line grew more colonies than those with a low-copy number of Per2 or wild-type MEFs, but they grew fewer colonies than PER2 S662D mutant MEFs (Figures 4c and d). The numbers for E1a-and Ras-induced transformation foci are 310\u00b1107 for PER2 S662D , 205\u00b152 for H line, 158 \u00b1 25 for Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 , 150 \u00b1 36 for PER2 S662G , 96 \u00b1 24 for L line, 74 \u00b1 35 for wild type and 8 \u00b1 5 for no-transfection control. These mice are on a wild-type background because of technical difficulty getting all embryos from seven genotype mice on a Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 background at one time. These findings are consistent with the apoptotic responses observed after X-ray exposure. Furthermore, similar transformation rates between PER2 S662G on wild-type background and Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs suggest that PER2 S662G is not just a loss of function mutation but has a dominant role. Altogether, these results illustrate the importance of the S662 site and of maintaining an appropriate level of PER2 to mediate the cellular response to environmental mutagens.",

The influence of PER2 S662 mutations on both X-ray-induced apoptosis and in vitro transformation led us to assess the relevance of the PER2 S662 mutation with regard to tumorigenesis in vivo. It has been noted that a mutation in one or more core clock genes is not sufficient to elicit increased tumor incidence in the absence of a cancer-sensitized genetic background. 22 As the PER2 S662 mutation is found in a human circadian variant, we mated PER2 S662 mutant mice with p53 R172H knock-in mice. These knock-in mice have a mutation that corresponds to the p53 R175H hot spot in human cancers. 16 Through breeding, we established cohorts of",

A closer inspection of the data revealed that the survival of female p53 R172H/ \u00fe and Clock D19/ \u00fe :p53 R172H/ \u00fe mice was decreased markedly compared with that of male mice (Supplementary Figures S1A and  B).

Thus, to further dissociate the effects of the PER2 S662 mutation on tumor development, we assessed male and female survival curves separately.

As tumors in p53 R172H/ \u00fe mice arise after a similar length of latency, these differences in the survival curves and median life spans reflected changes that contributed to tumorigenesis. This raises the question of why female and male on a p53 R172H/ \u00fe background have different survival rates, and why we did not observe a difference between PER2 S6622H :p53 R172H/ \u00fe 2 and p53 R172H/ \u00fe female mice, in contrast to the male mice. Of note, we did not obtain any p53 R172H/R172H female homozygous mice from 75 pups ( Supplementary Table 1), and we found that they all died by 13.5 days as a result of fatal embryonic exencephaly ( Figure 6). These findings are consistent with a previous reporting that lack of the tumor suppressor protein p53 causes a female-specific disruption of neural tube closure associated with embryonic or neonatal death. 23 This suggests that female p53 R172H/ \u00fe mice may have a penetrant phenotype that could have masked the effects of PER2 S662 mutations on female tumorigenesis. These data demonstrate collectively that the PER2 S662 mutation has an impact on tumor development in the p53 R172H/ \u00fe mutant background.",

However, the relative phases of p21 and Cyclin D appear to be highly similar in these Per2 allele mutant MEFs in contrast to the wild-type MEFs.

Therefore, we examined the transcription profiles of Nr1d1 to compare the results obtained from p21 and Cyclin D. We found the accumulation of Nr1d11 cycles with an antiphase to that of p21 transcription in the wild-type MEFs, indicating that NR1D1 inhibits the transcription of p21 expression as   Figure 6 Female-specific neural tube defects in p53 R172H/R172H mice. (a) p53 R172H/R172H female embryos develop exencephaly, which results from a failure of neural tube defects. This is a represent from 13.5-day mouse embryo from p53 R172H/ \u00fe and p53 R172H/ \u00fe crosses. Two p53 R172H/R172H females all develop exencephaly (arrow). (b) HE staining for female embryo neural tubes with exencephaly (arrow) described previously. 24 While in these mutant MEFs, p21 expression profiles are uncoupled at least in part from Nr1d1 expression ( Figure 7), thereby offering the possibility that NR1D1 needs wild-type PER2 to regulate the phase of p21 expression. In addition, as shown in Figure 7, the cycles of Nr1d1 transcripts respond to intrinsic circadian period in these mutant MEFs, while the periods of p21 and Cyclin D seem to be fixed 24 h in these mutant MEFs no matter whether they own short or long circadian period. Moreover, the phases of p21 transcripts delay to the same extend in Per2 allele mutant MEFs, suggesting that the ability of the circadian control of p21 expression has been abolished when PER2 is mutated, which is mediated mainly through NR1D1. This assumption is supported by a recent study by Isabelle Schmutz et al. 5 demonstrating that PER2 coordinates circadian output by interacting with NR1D1. The p21 protein inhibits the activity of cyclin-CDK2 or -CDK4 complexes, and functions as a regulator of cell cycle progression at G1. 25 Although the p21 expression levels in these PER2 mutant MEFs remains comparable to that of wild-type MEFs, the peak of p21 is locked to the abnormal region that overlaps with the peak of the cyclin D phase. It is conceivable that the p21/cyclin D interval variations may trigger cell cycle progression.",

In this study, we provided evidence that the human PER2 S662G mutation, which causes the FASPS circadian variant, is also responsible for increased cancer risk. To our knowledge, this represents the first instance of experimental evidence that links a human circadian mutation to cancer risk. Although the cancer incidence data in FASPS individuals are unavailable owing to scarcity of sampling (one family), a missense mutation in the evolutionarily conserved residue of hPER2 (L823V) has been identified in some human breast cancer samples 26 and altered PER2 expression is common in human breast malignancies. 27,28 By comparing the X-ray-induced apoptosis level and transformation rate among Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 , PER2 S662G , PER2 S662D and PER2 dose-dependent BAC transgenic mice, we suggested that PER2 S662G is a dominant negative mutation and PER2 S662D gains extra function to prevent apoptosis and increase transformation rate. Interestingly, the functional alternations of PER2 S662G and PER2 S662D displayed in the aspect of cell cycle are different from that in circadian clock, because PER2 S662G mice show shorter circadian period length than Per2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and PER2 S662D might elongate the circadian period through increasing PER2 protein level. Furthermore, our data that overexpressing and knockout PER2 both trigger more transformation foci and affect normal apoptosis function suggest that maintaining an optimal level of PER2 is critical to reduce the risk of tumorigenesis. Our functional studies of human variants of PER2, together with unbiased analyses in human cancer by other groups, indicate the importance of PER2 in human tumorigenesis. But the hypothesis that the FASPS mutation increases cancer risk in humans remains to be tested in future.",

However, the enhanced cancer risk in both PER2 S662G2H :p53 R172H/ \u00fe and PER2 S662D2H :p53 R172H/ \u00fe mice strongly suggested that the impaired PER2 gene, not the impaired circadian rhythm, is responsible for the increased cancer risk in these mice. This observation is further supported by survival data from the PER2 S662D2H :p53 R172H/ \u00fe and Clock D19/ \u00fe :p53 R172H/ \u00fe mice, both of which exhibited lengthened circadian periods, but showed highly contrary cancer risks. Interestingly, the 'impaired gene' theory is consistent with the observation from cancer risks in Cry1 \u00c0/\u00c0 :Cry2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice 22,29 and Clock D19 mutant mice. 30 In addition, we wish to point out that our experiments share an important similarity with the abovementioned investigations; all of these experimental systems retain the circadian mutant mice on normal light/dark cycles and subject these mice to entrainment from external time cues. Accordingly, the 'impaired gene' theory may only apply to circadian mutant mice kept in normal light/dark cycles. Circadian disruption is not as intense or detrimental in normal cycles as the disruption experienced by shift workers. In this regard, an important future direction may focus on both the respective contribution and the composite consequence of disrupted circadian genes, as well as disrupted circadian rhythm to cancer risk in persistent phase-shifted schedules.",

            "text": "The cell cycle, circadian clock and relative phase. Recent studies have shown that the circadian clock is coupled to the cell cycle processes through clockcontrolled genes, which may contain E-box or ROR elements in their promoters. Somewhat surprisingly, although we found that deregulation of PER2 has a strong effect on the induced transformation of MEFs and tumorigenesis; the gene expression changes in these clock-controlled genes are less profound in Per2 allele mutant MEFs. This leads us to think about their phase implication. Although the Nr1d1 transcripts displayed obvious phase shift and period length changes in these mutant MEFS, p21 transcripts displayed fixed 24-h-period oscillation with phase delay to the same extent, leading to a similar phase to that of Cyclin D. It indicates that in the wide-type MEFs, the opposite phases of p21 and Cyclin D are a result of coordination between circadian clock and cell cycle, with circadian clock adjusting transcription phase of p21 and the main driver of cell cycle. With the interaction of PER2, NR1D1 may be a critical circadian factor in exerting the phase adjusting function. At present, the physiological significance of the altered phases of these genes is unclear, and the phase shifting cannot explain all the phenotypes that are seen in these mutant mice. It is likely that modifier relative phases between the cycle genes influence features such as the number of transformation foci and the development of the tumor-associated fibroblasts. One of the possibilities comes from interfering with phase locking. Oscillation-based synchrony is the most energyefficient physical mechanism for temporal coordination. It occurs in many biological systems, including two oscillators of cell division and the circadian phase 31 or within a cell cycle oscillator through multiple regulatory interactions. 32 It is conceivable that, if phase-coupled p21 appears at a later phase of the inhibitory cycle while Cyclin D remains unchanged, the corresponding inhibition of the CDK complex becomes weak. In other words, if the threshold is reached, CDK activation can initialize unexpected cell cycle progression. It would be interesting, therefore, to investigate the extent to which relative phase changes might affect cell cycle progression, transformation and tumorigenesis.",

Representative actograms from low-(23.64\u00b10.11, n \u00bc 6), middle-(24.34\u00b10.18, n \u00bc 7) and high-copy BAC transgenic mice (25.07\u00b10.17, n \u00bc 9). Alternating white and dark bars indicate the LD cycles during entrainment before release in DD PER2 S662 affects changes in the relative phases of clockcontrolled cell cycle gene. To understand the mechanism underlying tumorigenesis, the clock-related cell cycle genes p21, c-Myc, Cyclin D1 and p27 were assayed in Per2 allele mutant MEFs. Unexpectedly, in several independent experiments, the expression levels of these circadian-related High-dose PER2 results in resistance to apoptosis induced by X-rays. (a) Low-, middle-and high-copy PER2 mice were irradiated with 6 Gy X-rays at ZT 9. Spleen cells were isolated 6 h after irradiation and the DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry. One representative experiment is shown.
