            "text": "Background: As more patients are treated by haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), development of secondary malignancy (SM) becomes an increasingly common issue in long-term survivors. Methods: We conducted a nationwide population-based study of the Taiwanese population to analyse patients who received HSCT between January 1997 and December 2010. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to compare the risk of SM in HSCT patients and the general population. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of SM. Results: Patients receiving HSCT had a significantly greater risk of developing SM (SIR 2.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-2.69; Po0.001). Specifically, the incidence increased for cancers of the oral cavity (SIR 14.18) and oesophagus (SIR 14.75) after allogeneic HSCT. Multivariate analysis revealed an increased SIR for cancer in patients who received the immunosuppressant azathioprine. The risk of SM also increased with greater cumulative doses of azathioprine. Conclusions: This study demonstrates an increased incidence of SM in Taiwanese patients who received allogeneic HSCT, especially for cancers of the oral cavity and oesophagus. This finding is different from results in populations of Western countries. Physicians should be cautious about azathioprine use for graft-vs-host disease after HSCT.",

Although the overall survival after transplantation has gradually improved, important concerns remain regarding long-term complications of HSCT, such as secondary malignancy (SM), chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGVHD), infertility, and quality of life (La Nasa et al, 2013). Recently, the development of SM has become a serious complication resulting in substantial mortality (Yokota et al, 2012).",

Patients receiving HSCT for solid organ cancers or immune deficiencies, metabolic disorders, or other congenital diseases were excluded. To avoid surveillance bias (Bilimoria et al, 2013;Chiolero et al, 2013), patients who developed cancers within 1 year after HSCT, as well as those who were followed for o1 year after HSCT were excluded. The following information was collected for all patients: basic data, comorbidities, primary diagnosis before HSCT, transplantation type (e.g., allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) or autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT)), TBI, use of immunosuppressive agents, and cGVHD status. A diagnosis of cGVHD was made by an experienced haematologist who reviewed data regarding patterns of immunosuppressant use.",

Patients were followed until the development of solid cancer, death, dropout from the NHI programme, or the end of 2011. Risk of SM in the HSCT cohort was calculated as the standardised incidence ratio (SIR), defined as the observed number of SM occurrence divided by the expected number of cases. The expected number was determined by multiplying the national incidence rate (in 5-year intervals) of same cancers stratified by gender, calendar year, and age, by the corresponding stratum-specific person-time accrued in this cohort. Incidence rates of cancers in the general population were obtained from the Taiwan Cancer Registry. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the SIRs were estimated under the assumption that the number of cancers followed a Poisson probability distribution. We determined the SIRs for subgroups defined by age at HSCT, sex, follow-up time since HSCT, and stem cell type. In addition, the SIR was estimated for each SM subtype.",

All factors with a P-value of o0.1 in the univariate analyses were included in the Cox multivariate analysis. Effects of immunosuppressant use after HSCT were treated as time-dependent variables to prevent an immortal time bias. Furthermore, if one type of immunosuppressant had a significant effect on SM in the Cox multivariate model, the effects of cumulative doses were estimated by time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models using cutoff points at non-use and the 50th percentile.",

In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, azathioprine use (HR 2.55, 95% CI 1.13-5.77; P \u00bc 0.025) was the only significant risk factor. There were trends for cGVHD (HR 2.19, 95% CI 0.91-5.27; P \u00bc 0.082) and sirolimus use (HR 6.34, 95% CI 0.81-49.29; P \u00bc 0.078) to be risk factors. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for the variables listed in Table 5 were performed to analyse the relationship between azathioprine dose and SM. Using the 50th percentile of cumulative doses as the cutoff point, a cumulative azathioprine dose of 415 100 mg after HSCT significantly increased the risk of SM. Exposure X15 100 mg would induce significantly higher risk (HR 3.58, 95% CI 1.37-9.38; P \u00bc 0.01) than those with o15 100 mg (HR 2.51, 95% CI 0.90-6.99; P \u00bc 0.079) in comparison with non-use ones (Table 5). Regarding auto-HSCT, patients who were 40 years or older, male, or had COPD had higher hazard ratios in the univariate analysis (Supplementary Table 2), but only age X40 years was significant for inclusion in the multivariate analysis (HR 3.74, 95% CI 1.19-11.80; P \u00bc 0.024).",

The single greatest risk factor for development of SM after allo-HSCT was azathioprine use, which increased the risk of cancer in a dosedependent manner.

A recent study of data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) database demonstrated that patients developed solid cancers after transplantation at twice the rate expected in the general population (Rizzo et al, 2009). These results are similar to our findings and those reported by Yokota et al (2012) in Japan. Of note, the SIR of SM was higher in young patients and increased with time. Rizzo et al (2009) reported competing risk analyses were 1% (95% CI 0.9-1.3%) at 10 years, 2.2% (95% CI 1.7-2.7%) at 15 years, and 3.3% (95% CI 2.4-4.5%) at 20 years after HSCT.

Combination use of steroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine significantly increased the risk of skin cancer after renal transplantation (Bouwes Bavinck et al, 1996). In HSCT, both chronic inflammation from cGVHD and immunosuppressant use may predispose patients to developing secondary malignancies. In 1996, an analysis of 700 patients undergoing HSCT for aplastic anaemia and Fanconi anaemia revealed that azathioprine for cGVHD was a definite risk for solid tumour development after allo-HSCT (Deeg et al, 1996). Another international case-control study identified several major risk factors for the development of squamous cell carcinoma after HSCT, including prolonged azathioprine use, especially when it was combined with cyclosporine and steroids for severe cGVHD (Curtis et al, 2005). The risk ratio was 8.44 (95% CI 3.17-22.47; Po0.001) in patients receiving cGVHD therapy for 424 months. An analysis of different immunosuppressants and therapy duration found that azathioprine, cyclosporine, and steroid therapy for 412 months, with or without other therapies, increased the risk of squamous cell carcinoma 38 times (Curtis et al, 2005). However, this study did not mention any association between azathioprine dose and SM.",

This finding suggests that not only duration, but also the cumulative dose of azathioprine affects the risk of SM after allo-HSCT. Azathioprine is an oral immunosuppressant that requires metabolic activation into thioguanine nucleotides. These nucleotide analogues (specifically, 6-thioguanine (6-TG)) are incorporated into DNA. DNA containing 6-TG, especially after radiation therapy, is susceptible to mutagenic oxidation and carries a risk of therapy-related cancer in long-term survivors of transplantation (O'Donovan et al, 2005).",

However, there are some epidemiological differences between Western and Eastern countries. Reports of data from the CIBMTR and FHCRC, which encompass populations in the United States of America and European countries, demonstrated that the sites of SMs, in order of decreasing incidence, were as follows: the oral cavity, liver, brain and central nervous system, and thyroid (Socie et al, 2000;Rizzo et al, 2009). However, our study from Taiwan and another from Japan (Yokota et al, 2012) revealed that in addition to cancers of the oral cavity, oesophageal cancer is also a common SM following allo-HSCT (Hasegawa et al, 2005;Shimada et al, 2005;Chen et al, 2011). This difference may be related to the higher incidence of oesophageal cancer in Asian countries (Warnakulasuriya, 2008;Lin et al, 2013;Zhang, 2013). Another notable difference is skin cancer, which is more frequent in Western countries and usually presents as melanoma rather than squamous or basal cell carcinoma. Skin cancer with melanoma was reported as an excess absolute risk of 1.5 by the CIBMTR and the FHCRC (Rizzo et al, 2009), but squamous or basal cell carcinoma is more common in Asian countries (Hasegawa et al, 2005;Yokota et al, 2012).Our study and the one by Shimada et al (2005) reported that no skin cancer was observed after allo-or auto-HSCT.",

However, our study and others showed no significant association between SM and radiation therapy (Hasegawa et al, 2005;Shimada et al, 2005;Yokota et al, 2012). One explanation for this discrepancy is the smaller proportion of young patients and shorter follow-up time after HSCT in our study. However, other pediatric studies and studies with long follow-up periods also found no association between SM and age or TBI (Baker et al, 2003;Kunkele et al, 2013). Similarly, TBI is associated with increased risk of skin cancers, such as melanoma (Rizzo et al, 2009) and basal or squamous cell carcinoma (Leisenring et al, 2006;Schwartz et al, 2009), but as mentioned above, no skin cancer was observed in our study or a study in Japan (Shimada et al, 2005). This discrepancy requires further investigation and may be the result of ethnic differences.",

The lack of statistical significance could be due to small patient number, however, the statistical trend may still implicate cGVHD as an independent risk factor for SM. There were 751 cases of cGVHD in our 1514 patients. This incidence of cGVHD was B49%, which is higher than in reports from Western countries (Rizzo et al, 2009;Majhail et al, 2011) and another Taiwanese study (Bai et al, 2004). Additional evidence comes from the significant effects of immunosuppressant use. The demand for prolonged use of immunosuppressants reflects the severity and duration of cGVHD. It is possible that in addition to immunosuppressants being a risk factor, cGVHD is, independently or synergistically with immunosuppressants, a risk factor for SM. A previous study also showed that cGVHD and the use of immunosuppressants are independent risks and the occurrence of both factors contributed to higher cancer risk (Curtis et al, 2005). Finally, patients had a much greater risk of SM following allo-HSCT than auto-HSCT, which had only slight increase of risk in male patients. This observation suggests that, in addition to high-dose chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, immunosuppressants (especially azathioprine) and cGVHD are important risk factors for SM.",

No information about conditioning regimen was available in our study, but a previous study reported that it did not influence the risk of SM development (Hasegawa et al, 2005). Majhail et al (2011) reported that conditioning with busulfancyclophosphamide increased SM in the oral cavity and other cancers, but that study only focused on busulfan-cyclophosphamide and not on other regimens. The association between the conditioning regimen and SM is still inconclusive and requires more investigation. Many other potential risk factors, such as T-cell depletion and manipulation, anti-thymocyte globulin, and lifestyle characteristics such as smoking or alcohol use, were not available for our analysis. However, these factors did not affect SM development in several previous studies (Curtis et al, 1997(Curtis et al, , 2005Hasegawa et al, 2005;Rizzo et al, 2009).",

The incidence of oral and oesophageal cancers in Taiwanese patients significantly increases after allo-HSCT. This result is a unique clinical feature that is different from patients in Western countries, where the oesophageal cancer risk is not increased. The use of the immunosuppressant azathioprine, especially with cumulative doses exceeding 15 100 mg, increases the risk of SM. Taking the autologous transplantation as a reference, our study demonstrates the significant effects of cGVHD and immunosuppressants as the risk of SM. Physicians should be cautious when using azathioprine for GVHD after HSCT. This study suggests that long-term survivors who are treated with HSCT, especially those with risks mentioned above, should be kept under long-term surveillance for early detection of SM.",
