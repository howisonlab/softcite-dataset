This study investigated these issues and assessed the added value of CRP to predictions. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdParticipants were drawn from representative samples of adults living in England and Scotland. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to relate baseline plasma CRP with all-cause and CVD mortality during follow-up in men and women with and without diabetes. The added value of CRP to the predictions was assessed through c-statistic comparison and relative integrated discrimination improvement. RESULTSdA total of 25,979 participants (4.9% with diabetes) were followed for a median of 93 months, during which period there were 2,767 deaths (957 from CVD). CRP (per SD log e) was associated with a 53% (95% CI 43-64) and 43% (38-49) higher risk of cardiovascular and allcause mortality, respectively. These associations were log linear and did not differ according to diabetes status (both P $ 0.08 for interaction), sex, and other risk factors. Adding CRP to conventional risk factors improved predictions overall and separately by diabetes status but not for CVD mortality, although such improvements only were marginal based on several discrimination statistics. CONCLUSIONSdThe association between CRP and CVD was similar across diabetes status, and the effects are broadly similar across levels of other conventional risk factors."

This effort has implicated several biomarkers, potentially reflecting different metabolic pathways, in the etiology of CVD (3). C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory biomarker, is one of the most well-documented emerging CVD risk factors (4,5). Concentrations of CRP in the upper part of the distribution within the normal range and above are associated with the long-term risk of CVD and allcause mortality in different populations (6,7).",

Interaction between diabetes and CRP was assessed by adding an interaction term to models that included the main effect of diabetes and log e CRP.

AUC comparisons used nonparametric methods (15). The relative integrated discrimination improvement (RIDI%), which measures the percentage improvement in discrimination when an extra variable is added to a prediction model (16), was computed. The 95% CIs for the RIDI% were derived with the use of the nonparametric bootstrap percentiles CI method, based on 1,000 replications. We also calculated 1) the likelihood ratio x 2 , which compares the adequacy of a model with covariates fitted to a set of data to that of the null model (without covariates) fitted to the same dataset; and 2) the Akaike information criterion (AIC), which allows for comparisons between models (nested or not); the smaller the value of the statistic, the better the model fits the data (17). Finally, we assessed the closeness between predicted and observed outcome rates using the Hosmer and Lemeshow calibration test (18). The basic model included age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference, physical activity, and total cholesterol. Additional models were constructed by adding CRP to the basic model as well as interaction terms of CRP with diabetes status and sex. The incremental value of CRP was further assessed by refitting the Framingham Anderson general equation for the prediction of cardiovascular mortality (without electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, a missing predictor in our sample) data with and without CRP (19). Comparisons were extended with the computation of the net reclassification improvement (16) based on four categories of 5-year predicted probability (i.e., 0 to ,2.5, 2.5 to ,5, 5 to ,7.5, and $7.5%).",

The basic model (without CRP) had acceptable to good discriminatory power in predicting cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, with an AUC ranging from 0.748, for cardiovascular mortality in people with diabetes, to 0.859 for the same outcome in participants without diabetes. Adding CRP to the basic model improved both the model goodness of fit and its discriminatory power. In participants with diabetes, however, there was no evidence for improvements in the AUC for the prediction of cardiovascular death (P = 0.31 for the difference in AUC). Despite some attenuation in the effect sizes, CRP always was positively associated with the outcomes in all multivariable models. Fit statistics for models with continuous log e CRP were better than those for the equivalent models with three categories of CRP (i.e., ,1, 1-3, and .3 mg/ L). For instance, at the total cohort level, the AIC and Dlikelihood ratio x 2 (main vs. basic models) for CVD mortality were 9,732 and 46, respectively, for models with log e CRP and 9,746 and 31, respectively, for models with three categories for CRP (Table 2). Adding the interaction terms of sex 3 CRP or diabetes 3 CRP (applicable only to the total cohort) did not improve the performance of the model (Table 2).

The associations of CRP with these two outcomes mostly are log linear and seem to be similar in participants with and without diabetes. The magnitude of the relationship of CRP with CVD and all-cause mortality did not seem to vary markedly by diabetes status, sex, and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

Those related to chronic hyperglycemia include oxidative stress, advanced glycation end products, endothelial dysfunction, acute-phase response, and procoagulant states. Based on these mechanisms, differences in the effects of CRP on CVD risk could be hypothetically observed in people with and without diabetes (with a less favorable risk for the former) as the result of differences in the pathological processes responsible for increased CRP in people with and without diabetes. The absence of any significant heterogeneity in our study and the large ERFC overview (7) argues against such a hypothesis. Some have instead suggested that other cardiovascular risk factors that frequently displayed less favorable levels in people with diabetes compared with those without can mask the association between CRP and CVD and make it a less stronger determinant in people with diabetes (24). However, our data, and other adequately powered studies (7), have shown that despite attenuation in effect estimates after adjustment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors, the association of CRP with CVD does not differ by diabetes status.",

            "text": "The current analyses were based on a single measurement of CRP, and there was no possibility to adjust for regression dilution bias (7). Our results, however, are similar to those from studies that have performed such adjustment (7). In addition, it has been demonstrated that CRP was stable enough for use in long-term predictions (3). The percentage of people with diabetes in our population was low as a result of the use of self-reported diagnosis without testing of blood glucose levels. Characteristics of diabetes, such as etiologic types and use of insulin were poorly defined, and data were not available on the duration of diagnosed diabetes and urinary albumin excretion, both powerful determinants of cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes. Therefore, we were unable to account for their possible effects in regression analyses. Our study also has major strengths, including its large sample  size and number of deaths recorded, our ability to directly compare the effects of CRP on mortality risk in people with and without diabetes, and our ability to assess the possible effects of sex and other cardiovascular risk factors on the observed relationships. Based on available evidence (4,28,29), a causal role for CRP in CVD is less certain. Therefore, CRP may not be a target for CVD prevention (2,30). It is expected that trials of specific CRP antagonists and low-dose methotrexate will clarify this in the future (31). The JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) has shown that CRP was useful for targeting statin therapy in healthy individuals with normal-range LDL cholesterol (32). Other studies have suggested inconsistent effects of CRP on CVD risk prediction beyond traditional predictors (25,26). Our study suggests that CRP levels convey prediction information on the risk of CVD that is complementary to that provided by conventional cardiovascular risk factors and that improvement in the predictions is likely similar in people with diabetes and those without but is not affected by sex. Such improvements, however, remain modest and do not lend strong support to any recommendation of routinely measuring CRP for the purpose of enhancing the prediction of future risk of major outcomes. Our study also extends previous reports that traditional risk factors were similar determinants of the risk of CVD regardless of diabetes status (33)(34)(35).",
