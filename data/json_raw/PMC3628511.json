            "text": "Whereas the position of disulfides in folded proteins is ruled largely by thermodynamic considerations (Anfinsen, 1973), the rate at which disulfides form is influenced by the concentration and activity of reduced and oxidized protein thiol oxidoreductases in the ER lumen. The mammalian ER contains at least 20 such protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)-like oxidoreductases, which have in common the presence of one or more thioredoxin domains through which they accept and donate disulfides to contingent proteins (Ellgaard and Ruddock, 2005;Hatahet and Ruddock, 2009). Several factors affect the redox poise of this heterogeneous collection of oxidoreductases: Upstream are enzymes that function as ER oxidases; they accept electrons from the reduced oxidoreductases and transfer them to small molecule acceptors. ERO1, conserved from yeast to mammals, oxidizes PDI family members by reducing molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (Tu et al., 2000;Gross et al., 2006) and the ER localized peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4) serves a backup, oxidizing PDIs by reducing hydrogen peroxide to water (Tavender et al., 2008;Zito et al., 2010b). Other enzymatic (Kodali and Thorpe, 2010;Nguyen et al., 2011) and nonenzymatic processes (Ruddock, 2012) may also contribute to disulfide bond formation in the ER lumen. The aforementioned oxidizing features of the ER are opposed by the ingress of reduced cysteine residues in newly synthesized secreted proteins and by the pool of reduced glutathione (Hwang et al., 1992;Cuozzo and Kaiser, 1999;Chakravarthi et al., 2006).",

            "text": "ER oxidation is vigorously defended. The genes encoding ERO1 and several PDIs are under positive transcriptional control by the unfolded protein response (Frand and Kaiser, 1998;Pagani et al., 2000;Travers et al., 2000) and allosteric mechanisms are in place to regulate the enzymes (Sevier et al., 2007;Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2008;Baker et al., 2008). These regulatory features likely account for the recovery of disulfides within minutes of reversing a reductive pulse (Braakman et al., 1992;Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2010). Mice tolerate severe loss-of-function mutations to the two genes encoding ERO1 I nterfering with disulfide bond formation impedes protein folding and promotes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Due to limitations in measurement techniques, the relationships of altered thiol redox and ER stress have been difficult to assess. We report that fluorescent lifetime measurements circumvented the crippling dimness of an ER-tuned fluorescent redox-responsive probe (roGFPiE), faithfully tracking the activity of the major ER-localized protein disulfide isomerase, PDI. In vivo lifetime imaging by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) recorded subtle changes in ER redox poise induced by exposure of mammalian cells to a reducing environment but revealed an unanticipated stability of redox to fluctuations in unfolded protein load. By contrast, TCSPC of roGFPiE uncovered a hitherto unsuspected reductive shift in the mammalian ER upon loss of luminal calcium, whether induced by pharmacological inhibition of calcium reuptake into the ER or by physiological activation of release channels. These findings recommend fluorescent lifetime imaging as a sensitive method to track ER redox homeostasis in mammalian cells.",

Therefore, we hypothesized isoforms, Ero1L and Ero1Lb (Zito et al., 2010a;Chin et al., 2011), further attesting to the redundancy of pathways for disulfide bond formation.

Pharmacological and genetic manipulations that adversely affect protein folding homeostasis in the yeast ER are reported to promote a more reducing environment (Merksamer et al., 2008), whereas in mammals, enforced expression of a difficult to fold secreted protein leads to hyperoxidation, which contributes to failure of secretion (Malhotra et al., 2008).",

            "text": "These studies suggest that deviation from healthy thiol redox poise may contribute to impaired protein folding in the overloaded ER, but offer contradictory indications as to the direction of the deviation. Resolving this conundrum requires tools to accurately measure ER redox poise; a nontrivial problem. It is possible to detect changes in ER redox poise by following the distribution of disulfides and dithiols in sentinel ER resident proteins. Bulk biochemical methods to track the redox status of individual ER proteins exist, but these end-point assays are subject to post-lysis experimental artifacts, lack spatial and temporal resolution, and provide limited information on intra-sample variation. These limitations have stimulated the development of redox-sensitive intravital optical probes that function in the ER lumen. A particularly promising approach has been to exploit the optical perturbation introduced by the presence of a disulfide on the surface of the green fluorescent protein \ue062-barrel (Bj\u00f6rnberg et al., 2006;Cannon and Remington, 2008;Meyer and Dick, 2010). Introduction of cysteine residues on the surface of such redox-sensitive GFP (roGFP) results in a fluorescent protein whose excitation properties differ between the dithiol and the disulfide state: The ratio of emitted fluorescence when excited at 390 nm versus 475 nm reports on the ratio of disulfide versus dithiol in the population of probe molecules (Hanson et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The first generation of roGFPs, although useful in tracking redox in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial matrix, proved too reducing for the oxidizing environment of the ER. This challenge was ingeniously met by introducing a single amino acid insertion into the roGFP \ue062-barrel adjacent to cysteine 147, in what were named \"roGFP insertion X\" (roGFPiX, where X is the inserted amino acid). Destabilization of the optically perturbing 147-204 disulfide in roGFPiX resulted in a less reducing protein whose midpoint potential was thus predicted suitable to detect fluctuations in redox poise in the oxidizing environment of the ER (Lohman and Remington, 2008). One such probe, roGFPiL, was introduced into the ER lumen of mammalian cells and proved sensitive to changing redox changes (van Lith et al., 2011). Unfortunately, the insertion that tunes roGFPiX redox potential to the oxidizing environment in the ER has a negative impact on fluorescent intensity, compromising sensitivity (Lohman and Remington, 2008). One can partially overcome this problem with higher illumination, but at the risk of photo-toxicity and perturbation of the redox environment (Hoebe et al., 2007;van Lith et al., 2011). We have discovered that the dithiol and disulfide states of roGFPiX variants are associated with vastly different fluorescence lifetimes. Thus, real-time fluorescent (Fig. 2, A and C). Fluorescence lifetime of roGFPiE was unaffected by the presence of iodine (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that the lifetime alterations in roGFPiX variants does not result from exposure of the fluorophore to collisional quenching and predicting a measure of indifference to the ionic environment.",

HEK 293T cells exhibit a wide range of sensitivity to the ER calcium store-depleting effects of thapsigargin, necessitating the use of relatively high concentrations of this SERCA inhibitor (Fig. S3, C and D). To determine if the correlation between depletion of lumenal calcium and a more reducing ER extended to reversible, physiological calcium signaling, we exploited the responsiveness of pancreatic acinar AR42j cells to the gut hormone cholecystokinin (Zhao et al., 1990). As expected, cholecystokinin reversibly depleted lumenal calcium stores, as monitored by the fluorescence lifetime of the FRET-based probe D1ER cameleon (Fig. 7, A  and B, left;Palmer et al., 2004). The temporal profile of ER calcium store depletion correlated well with the cholecystokinin-mediated shortening of ERroGFPiE fluorescence lifetime and with its observation (Fig. 6 B). To promote sensitivity to spatial inhomogeneity in redox poise, were it to occur, these measurements were conducted in COS7, with superior spatial resolution. Redox poise was defended throughout the ER in PERK inhibitor-treated cells (Fig. 6 C). Translational control is especially important under conditions of ER stress and PERK deficiency strongly sensitizes cells to tunicamycin (Harding et al., 2000). Interestingly, tunicamycin-treated cells experienced defective ER redox when the PERK pathway was simultaneously compromised (Fig. 6 B, yellow trace; and Fig. 6 C, bottom-most panels).",

It was of interest therefore to note that within minutes of exposure to thapsigargin, ERroGFPiE fluorescence lifetime decreased to a new baseline, corresponding to an apparent reductive shift of 24 mV from However, the feeble fluorescent signal of these roGFPiX probes compromises their utility in vivo, where normal background autofluorescence overlaps their emission spectrum and confounds the intensity-based ratiometric excitation measurement used to estimate the redox state of the probe. Our findings indicate that the insertion of residue 147a, which destabilizes the disulfide and renders the probe less reducing (and thus suited to the ER environment), fortuitously subordinates the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore to the redox state of the adjacent cysteines.

Lifetime measurements offer advantages in deconvoluting signals emanating from cellular autofluorescence, whose lifetime differs considerably from roGFPiE (as exemplified by Fig. 3 A, panel 6, and Fig. S2 A) and thus provides a measurement gated on the fluorescent properties of the probe. The large number of events acquired by photon counting provides reliable data at weak excitation intensities. This is revealed by the narrowness of the distribution of lifetimes measured in vivo under diverse physiological conditions and favors the detection of subtle differences in the state of the probe, while avoiding photo-toxicity and photo-oxidation.",

There are other hints that in mammalian cells redox in the ER and cytosol may be quite isolated.

Calcium depletion promptly leads to unfolded protein stress in the ER lumen (Prostko et al., 1992), but a role for ER protein misfolding in the shift of roGFPiE to a more reduced poise is rendered unlikely by the observation that tunicamycin and azetidine, which severely perturb ER protein folding homeostasis, have no such effect.",

It is nonetheless tempting to speculate on the physiological significance of the shift to a less oxidizing ER after calcium release. Reduction of a lumenal disulfide involving cysteines 2496 or 2505 by the ER-localized ERp44 attenuates calcium release by the R1 isoform of the inositol phosphate-3 receptor (Higo et al., 2005), and thiol oxidation has been shown to attenuate the reuptake of calcium into the ER via the SERCA pump (Scherer and Deamer, 1986). Conversely, compromise of ERO1 activity limits activity-dependent calcium release in cardiomyocytes (Chin et al., 2011). This dialectic of thiol redox and calcium flux across the ER membrane is consistent with a rectifying feedback mechanism that opposes the consequences of ER calcium depletion on thiol redox poise and a role for the reducing poise elicited by calcium release as a negative feedback loop to conserve lumenal calcium or limit cytosolic calcium signaling. devices commonly used in microscopy. In addition, immunity to saturation of the counting mode used to generate the intensity image and the single light path used throughout the FLIM image acquisition both contribute to its superior accuracy. The practical advantages of lifetime imaging over ratiometric measurements are nicely demonstrated by the contrast between the stable baseline of the probe obtained during repeated lifetime measurement in vivo (Fig. 4 C) and the creeping baseline attributed to photo-oxidation caused by the intense illumination required to generate a signal in intensity-based ratiometric measurements (van Lith et al., 2011).",

Neither tunicamycin nor azetidine, which impede folding and induce high levels of ER stress, affected redox poise. Nor was ER redox measurably affected by shutting off the influx of unfolded proteins into the ER. An extreme imbalance between client protein influx and the capacity of the cellular machinery, imposed by disabling the PERK-mediated translational limb of the unfolded protein response in cells exposed to the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, led to an inappropriately reducing ER. But these extreme circumstances showcase the stability of ER redox under more physiological circumstances."

Desired excitation wavelength (typically 470 nm for FLIM of GFP variants and 440 nm for D1ER cameleon FRET) was tuned using an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTFnC-VIS; AA Opto-Electronic). Desired emission was collected using 510/42 and 470-490 bandpass filters for GFP variants and D1ER cameleon accordingly and detected by a fast photomultiplier tube (PMC-100; Becker & Hickl GmbH). Lifetimes for each pixel were recorded using TCSPC circuitry (SPC-830; Becker & Hickl GmbH), keeping count rates below 1% of the laser repetition rate to prevent pulse pile-up. Images were acquired over 20-60 s, with a typical flow rate of 5 \u00d7 10 4 photons sec \ue0321 , while detector speed saturation (pile-up effect) is not observed below 10 6 photons sec \ue0321 in this instrument. The data were processed using SPCImage (Becker & Hickl GmbH) fitting the time-correlated photon count data obtained for each pixel of the image to a monoexponential decay function, yielding a value for lifetime on the picosecond scale."
