            "text": "Whereas the position of disulfides in folded proteins is ruled largely by thermodynamic considerations (Anfinsen, 1973), the rate at which disulfides form is influenced by the concentration and activity of reduced and oxidized protein thiol oxidoreductases in the ER lumen. The mammalian ER contains at least 20 such protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)-like oxidoreductases, which have in common the presence of one or more thioredoxin domains through which they accept and donate disulfides to contingent proteins (Ellgaard and Ruddock, 2005;Hatahet and Ruddock, 2009). Several factors affect the redox poise of this heterogeneous collection of oxidoreductases: Upstream are enzymes that function as ER oxidases; they accept electrons from the reduced oxidoreductases and transfer them to small molecule acceptors. ERO1, conserved from yeast to mammals, oxidizes PDI family members by reducing molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (Tu et al., 2000;Gross et al., 2006) and the ER localized peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4) serves a backup, oxidizing PDIs by reducing hydrogen peroxide to water (Tavender et al., 2008;Zito et al., 2010b). Other enzymatic (Kodali and Thorpe, 2010;Nguyen et al., 2011) and nonenzymatic processes (Ruddock, 2012) may also contribute to disulfide bond formation in the ER lumen. The aforementioned oxidizing features of the ER are opposed by the ingress of reduced cysteine residues in newly synthesized secreted proteins and by the pool of reduced glutathione (Hwang et al., 1992;Cuozzo and Kaiser, 1999;Chakravarthi et al., 2006).",

            "text": "ER oxidation is vigorously defended. The genes encoding ERO1 and several PDIs are under positive transcriptional control by the unfolded protein response (Frand and Kaiser, 1998;Pagani et al., 2000;Travers et al., 2000) and allosteric mechanisms are in place to regulate the enzymes (Sevier et al., 2007;Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2008;Baker et al., 2008). These regulatory features likely account for the recovery of disulfides within minutes of reversing a reductive pulse (Braakman et al., 1992;Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2010). Mice tolerate severe loss-of-function mutations to the two genes encoding ERO1 I nterfering with disulfide bond formation impedes protein folding and promotes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Due to limitations in measurement techniques, the relationships of altered thiol redox and ER stress have been difficult to assess. We report that fluorescent lifetime measurements circumvented the crippling dimness of an ER-tuned fluorescent redox-responsive probe (roGFPiE), faithfully tracking the activity of the major ER-localized protein disulfide isomerase, PDI. In vivo lifetime imaging by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) recorded subtle changes in ER redox poise induced by exposure of mammalian cells to a reducing environment but revealed an unanticipated stability of redox to fluctuations in unfolded protein load. By contrast, TCSPC of roGFPiE uncovered a hitherto unsuspected reductive shift in the mammalian ER upon loss of luminal calcium, whether induced by pharmacological inhibition of calcium reuptake into the ER or by physiological activation of release channels. These findings recommend fluorescent lifetime imaging as a sensitive method to track ER redox homeostasis in mammalian cells.",

            "text": "The lifetime of the compromising autofluorescence (3.0 ns) was found to be significantly longer than that reported for GFP (2.4 ns; Esposito et al., 2005;Wallrabe and Periasamy, 2005) and was unresponsive to DTT (Fig. S2 A). Therefore, we hypothesized isoforms, Ero1L and Ero1Lb (Zito et al., 2010a;Chin et al., 2011), further attesting to the redundancy of pathways for disulfide bond formation. Against this background of robustness are studies reporting strong deviation of redox poise under conditions of unfolded protein stress in the ER. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations that adversely affect protein folding homeostasis in the yeast ER are reported to promote a more reducing environment (Merksamer et al., 2008), whereas in mammals, enforced expression of a difficult to fold secreted protein leads to hyperoxidation, which contributes to failure of secretion (Malhotra et al., 2008).",

            "text": "These studies suggest that deviation from healthy thiol redox poise may contribute to impaired protein folding in the overloaded ER, but offer contradictory indications as to the direction of the deviation. Resolving this conundrum requires tools to accurately measure ER redox poise; a nontrivial problem. It is possible to detect changes in ER redox poise by following the distribution of disulfides and dithiols in sentinel ER resident proteins. Bulk biochemical methods to track the redox status of individual ER proteins exist, but these end-point assays are subject to post-lysis experimental artifacts, lack spatial and temporal resolution, and provide limited information on intra-sample variation. These limitations have stimulated the development of redox-sensitive intravital optical probes that function in the ER lumen. A particularly promising approach has been to exploit the optical perturbation introduced by the presence of a disulfide on the surface of the green fluorescent protein \ue062-barrel (Bj\u00f6rnberg et al., 2006;Cannon and Remington, 2008;Meyer and Dick, 2010). Introduction of cysteine residues on the surface of such redox-sensitive GFP (roGFP) results in a fluorescent protein whose excitation properties differ between the dithiol and the disulfide state: The ratio of emitted fluorescence when excited at 390 nm versus 475 nm reports on the ratio of disulfide versus dithiol in the population of probe molecules (Hanson et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The first generation of roGFPs, although useful in tracking redox in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial matrix, proved too reducing for the oxidizing environment of the ER. This challenge was ingeniously met by introducing a single amino acid insertion into the roGFP \ue062-barrel adjacent to cysteine 147, in what were named \"roGFP insertion X\" (roGFPiX, where X is the inserted amino acid). Destabilization of the optically perturbing 147-204 disulfide in roGFPiX resulted in a less reducing protein whose midpoint potential was thus predicted suitable to detect fluctuations in redox poise in the oxidizing environment of the ER (Lohman and Remington, 2008). One such probe, roGFPiL, was introduced into the ER lumen of mammalian cells and proved sensitive to changing redox changes (van Lith et al., 2011). Unfortunately, the insertion that tunes roGFPiX redox potential to the oxidizing environment in the ER has a negative impact on fluorescent intensity, compromising sensitivity (Lohman and Remington, 2008). One can partially overcome this problem with higher illumination, but at the risk of photo-toxicity and perturbation of the redox environment (Hoebe et al., 2007;van Lith et al., 2011). We have discovered that the dithiol and disulfide states of roGFPiX variants are associated with vastly different fluorescence lifetimes. Thus, real-time fluorescent (Fig. 2, A and C). Fluorescence lifetime of roGFPiE was unaffected by the presence of iodine (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that the lifetime alterations in roGFPiX variants does not result from exposure of the fluorophore to collisional quenching and predicting a measure of indifference to the ionic environment.",

Interestingly, the fluorescence lifetimes of roGFP1, the C147/C204-containing parent of roGFPiE that lacks the E147a insertion, was long in both its reduced and oxidized configuration (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the perturbation promoted by reduction of the disulfide requires the insertion at 147a.

However, the effect of the resulting stress on ER thiol redox remains poorly characterized. In budding yeast, an ER-localized roGFP2 had been reported to undergo reduction on exposure to tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation that causes unfolded protein stress (Merksamer et al., 2008). However, given the reducing midpoint potential of roGFP2, \ue0320.272 V (Hanson et al., 2004), it is suited to detect catastrophic deviations in redox state, but cannot track physiological variations around the organelles' midpoint lifetime, as expected ( Fig. S2 A). The autofluorescent signal of untransfected cells had a patchy distribution and although foci of high intensity autofluorescence were noted, pixels containing such signal could be rejected based on their unusually long lifetime and lack of response to DTT (Fig. S2 A). Together, these observations confirmed that roGFPiE FLIM tracked protein thiol redox in the ER of living cells and could be unmixed from polluting background autofluorescence.",

Unfortunately, spectral overlap with roGFPiE precluded the use of IRE1 inhibitors (which fluoresce strongly in that range) and confined our analysis to the consequences of long-term disruption of the IRE1 pathway.

HEK 293T cells exhibit a wide range of sensitivity to the ER calcium store-depleting effects of thapsigargin, necessitating the use of relatively high concentrations of this SERCA inhibitor (Fig. S3, C and D). To determine if the correlation between depletion of lumenal calcium and a more reducing ER extended to reversible, physiological calcium signaling, we exploited the responsiveness of pancreatic acinar AR42j cells to the gut hormone cholecystokinin (Zhao et al., 1990). As expected, cholecystokinin reversibly depleted lumenal calcium stores, as monitored by the fluorescence lifetime of the FRET-based probe D1ER cameleon (Fig. 7, A  and B, left;Palmer et al., 2004). The temporal profile of ER calcium store depletion correlated well with the cholecystokinin-mediated shortening of ERroGFPiE fluorescence lifetime and with its observation (Fig. 6 B). To promote sensitivity to spatial inhomogeneity in redox poise, were it to occur, these measurements were conducted in COS7, with superior spatial resolution. Redox poise was defended throughout the ER in PERK inhibitor-treated cells (Fig. 6 C). Translational control is especially important under conditions of ER stress and PERK deficiency strongly sensitizes cells to tunicamycin (Harding et al., 2000). Interestingly, tunicamycin-treated cells experienced defective ER redox when the PERK pathway was simultaneously compromised (Fig. 6 B, yellow trace; and Fig. 6 C, bottom-most panels).",

It was of interest therefore to note that within minutes of exposure to thapsigargin, ERroGFPiE fluorescence lifetime decreased to a new baseline, corresponding to an apparent reductive shift of 24 mV from However, the feeble fluorescent signal of these roGFPiX probes compromises their utility in vivo, where normal background autofluorescence overlaps their emission spectrum and confounds the intensity-based ratiometric excitation measurement used to estimate the redox state of the probe. Our findings indicate that the insertion of residue 147a, which destabilizes the disulfide and renders the probe less reducing (and thus suited to the ER environment), fortuitously subordinates the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore to the redox state of the adjacent cysteines. The dithiol has a considerably shorter fluorescence lifetime than the disulfide, thus the redox state of the probe can be estimated by measuring its fluorescence lifetime in vivo.",

It is nonetheless tempting to speculate on the physiological significance of the shift to a less oxidizing ER after calcium release. Reduction of a lumenal disulfide involving cysteines 2496 or 2505 by the ER-localized ERp44 attenuates calcium release by the R1 isoform of the inositol phosphate-3 receptor (Higo et al., 2005), and thiol oxidation has been shown to attenuate the reuptake of calcium into the ER via the SERCA pump (Scherer and Deamer, 1986). Conversely, compromise of ERO1 activity limits activity-dependent calcium release in cardiomyocytes (Chin et al., 2011). This dialectic of thiol redox and calcium flux across the ER membrane is consistent with a rectifying feedback mechanism that opposes the consequences of ER calcium depletion on thiol redox poise and a role for the reducing poise elicited by calcium release as a negative feedback loop to conserve lumenal calcium or limit cytosolic calcium signaling. devices commonly used in microscopy. In addition, immunity to saturation of the counting mode used to generate the intensity image and the single light path used throughout the FLIM image acquisition both contribute to its superior accuracy. The practical advantages of lifetime imaging over ratiometric measurements are nicely demonstrated by the contrast between the stable baseline of the probe obtained during repeated lifetime measurement in vivo (Fig. 4 C) and the creeping baseline attributed to photo-oxidation caused by the intense illumination required to generate a signal in intensity-based ratiometric measurements (van Lith et al., 2011).",

The GFP fluorophore is well protected by the encasing \ue062-barrel (Remington, 2011), and fluorescence of reduced roGFPiE is not quenched by halogens. Thus, it seems unlikely that a structural alteration in the wall of the GFP \ue062-barrel exposes the fluorophore to collisional quenching when the C147/C204 disulfide has been reduced. More likely, the shorter lifetime is intrinsic to the disposition of the fluorophore in relation to other residues of the 147a insertion-containing GFP \ue062-barrel, a perturbation that is reversed by formation of the C147/C204 disulfide.",

ER redox poise is a convenient heuristic term applied to a nonequilibrium situation; no single sentinel disulfide can serve as a general redox probe for the compartment (Kemp et al., 2008). Nonetheless, the dramatic acceleration by PDI of the equilibration of roGFPiE with a glutathione redox buffer, observed here, suggests that roGFPiE is a good surrogate for clients of PDI. As these include reduced, unfolded, nascent secreted proteins, roGFPiE is likely to report on a physiologically relevant aspect of the redox of PDI substrates.",

An extreme imbalance between client protein influx and the capacity of the cellular machinery, imposed by disabling the PERK-mediated translational limb of the unfolded protein response in cells exposed to the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, led to an inappropriately reducing ER.
