            "text": "Actinomyces strain A01 was isolated from soil of a vegetable field in the suburb of Beijing, China. According to the morphological, cultural, physiological and biochemical characteristics, and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, strain A01 was identified as Streptomyces lydicus. In the antimicrobial spectrum test strain A01 presented a stable and strong inhibitory activity against several plant pathogenic fungi such as Fusarium oxysporum, Botrytis cinerea, Monilinia laxa, etc. However, no antibacterial activity was found. In pot experiments in greenhouse, the development of tomato gray mold was markedly suppressed by treatment with the fermentation broth of the strain A01, and the control efficacy was higher than those of Pyrimethanil and Polyoxin. A main antifungal compound (purity 99.503%) was obtained from the fermentation broth of strain A01 using column chromatography and HPLC. The chemical structural analysis with UV, IR, MS, and NMR confirmed that the compound produced by the strain A01 is natamycin, a polyene antibiotic produced by S. chattanovgensis, S. natalensis, and S. gilvosporeus, widely used as a natural biological preservative for food according to previous reports. The present study revealed a new producing strain of natamycin and its potential application as a biological control agent for fungal plant diseases.",

            "text": "Plant diseases caused by fungi are one of the major reasons for causing agricultural losses (8). Gray mold disease, caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea, has now become a limiting factor in the vegetable production in many areas of China. The disease used to be and is still being mainly controlled by chemical fungicides, such as aminobenzimidazoles, phthalimide, and carbamates (28,29). However, resistance has been found in B. cinerea to several of these chemicals (24). Furthermore, long term application of chemicals have caused serious food and environment pollutions, and brought attention to the search for alternative measures in controlling plant fungal diseases.",

Several Streptomyces strains that suppressed the growth of B. cinerea were shown to produce antibiotic compounds such as phosphazomyzin, albopeptin B, tautomycin, tautomycein, and ezomycin S (18). The diverse chemical structures of these metabolites would reduce the chance for pathogens to develop resistance (26). In addition, the searching for antimicrobial metabolites has also been spurred on by the possibilities that they could be developed into new classes fungicides (5,10).

The active fractions resulted in 6 peaks on the first HPLC separation spectrum, and the fraction corresponding to the peak appearing at the elution time of 57.399 min was identified as the active one. The active fraction was separated again by second HPLC. A fraction with higher activity was obtained as the terminal constituent, which corresponded to the peak at the elution time of 38.399 min on the last HPLC spectrum. Only one peak was  detected for the terminal constituent by analytical HPLC, which revealed that the constituent contained a single compound. The relative area of the peak suggested a purity up to 99.503% for the compound, sufficiently meeting the requirement for structural analysis. The terminal active constituent was dried in a vacuum into white powder that was partially soluble in N, Ndimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), pyridine, acetic acid with water, methanol or ethanol with water, but insoluble in acetone, chloroform, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and water. The UV spectrum showed that the active compound dissolved in methanol-water presented four typical absorbance peaks at wavelengths 281 nm, 291 nm, 305 nm and 319 nm, which is the typical characteristic of conjugated polyene chemicals. In the IR spectrum, the peaks at \u03bd>3000 cm -1 indicated that there is a typical carboxyl-structure; the \u03bd=1716 cm -1 peak revealed a conjugated ester; the \u03bd=1570 cm -1 peak corresponded to a primary amine; and the \u03bd=1270-1150 cm -1 peaks showed the existence of different C-O-. The molecular weight 665 and the molecular formula C33H47NO13 of the antibiotic compound of strain A01 were deduced by high resolution FT -mass spectroscopy (M+Na, m/z 688.2938, calculated 688.2940) (Fig.  1). In the 1 H-NMR spectrum (Fig. 2), the hydrogen on the carboxyl-was neutralized in the solvent DMF, causing the disappearance of peak \u03b4=12and the presence of two solvent peaks of \u03b4=3 and 8 at the same time; the group of peaks next to \u03b4=6 represented the hydrogen bonded on the conjugated ester, and the group of peaks around \u03b4=5 presented a -OH. In the 13 C-NMR spectrum (Fig. 3), the peaks of \u03b4=180 and 165 are indicative of the existence of carboxyl and ester groups, the peak of \u03b4=130 was produced by polyethylene, and the most intensive peak was given by the solvent DMF. In addition, COSY, TOCSY, DEPT, NOE, HMBC and HMQC spectrometry were also conducted on the compound. Based on the analysis of NMR data and other chemical characteristics, the antibiotic compound of A01 turned out to have the same structure as natamycin as shown in Fig. 4.    ",
