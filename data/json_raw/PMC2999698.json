            "text": "The level of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), also known as glycated hemoglobin, determines how well a patient's blood glucose level has been controlled over the previous 8-12 weeks. HbA1c levels help patients and doctors understand whether a particular diabetes treatment is working and whether adjustments need to be made to the treatment. Because the HbA1c level is a marker of blood glucose for the previous 60-90 days, average blood glucose levels can be estimated using HbA1c levels. Our aim in the present study was to investigate the relationship between estimated average glucose levels, as calculated by HbA1c levels, and fasting plasma glucose levels. METHODS: The fasting plasma glucose levels of 3891 diabetic patient samples (1497 male, 2394 female) were obtained from the laboratory information system at the Izmir Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital in Turkey. These samples were selected from patient samples that had hemoglobin levels between 12 and 16 g/dL. The estimated glucose levels were calculated using the following formula: 28.7 x HbA1c-46.7. Glucose and HbA1c levels were determined using hexokinase and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods, respectively. RESULTS: A strong positive correlation between fasting plasma glucose levels and estimated average blood glucose levels (r = 0.757, p,0.05) was observed. The difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Reporting the estimated average glucose level together with the HbA1c level is believed to assist patients and doctors determine the effectiveness of blood glucose control measures.",

            "text": "The management of diabetes mellitus requires an accurate evaluation of blood glucose control to assess the efficiency of a particular therapy. Whole blood hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurements have been widely used in diabetes patients for more than 25 years to monitor long-term glycemic control. 1,2 The measurement indicates a patient's average blood glucose level during the previous 60-90 days. It is recommended that diabetes patients have their HbA1c levels checked at least two times per year because quantitative and direct relationships have been identified between HbA1c concentration and the risk of diabetic microvascular complications. 3 Therefore, clinicians use HbA1c test results to guide treatment decisions, and the test has become the cornerstone for assessing diabetes care. 4 Various analytical methods based on different assay techniques, such as ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, immunoassays and electrophoresis, have been used to measure glycated hemoglobin levels. 5 As a result, HbA1c results can vary considerably when measured by different laboratories or methods. Recently, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) developed a new reference method that specifically measures the concentration of a single molecular species of glycated A1c. 4 However, the new method results in values that are 1.5%-2.0% lower than current values, and the results are expressed in different units (millimoles per mole of unglycated hemoglobin), which may cause confusion for patients and health care providers. 6 The relationship between the mean blood glucose level and the level of HbA1c has been investigated in different studies, and various equations have been obtained. 2,7,8 Using Nathan's regression equation, which has been recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the estimated average glucose (eAG) level calculation and its relationship to the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level were investigated in the present study.",

            "text": "The HbA1c measurement is used to determine the average level of glycemic control over the previous [8][9][10][11][12] weeks; this measurement is accepted as a gold-standard measurement of chronic glycemia. 4 Despite its wide international use, there is a substantial lack of standardization among HbA1c determination methods. The desire to standardize the HbA1c results obtained from different techniques led the IFCC to create a reference method, but this method created problems in reporting measurement results. 7 One problem is the risk of decreasing a patient's glycemic control; when a patient's HbA1c measurement is lower than previous results, he or she might become confused and perhaps change diet, which could negatively impact his or her metabolic control. 9 The other problem is the reporting of HbA1c levels in mmol HbA1c per mol total Hb, which could confuse patients. In addition, guidelines for diabetes have been based on standard levels that are derived from reports of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). The equivalent of the current HbA1c targets of 6.5% and 7.5% are 48 milimoles per mole and 59 milimoles per mole in the new units. To resolve these problems, the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) sponsored an international study to define a mathematical relationship between HbA1c and the eAG level. 6 The following formula describes this relationship: 28.7 x HbA1c -46.7 = eAG. This formula will assist health care providers and their patients in interpreting HbA1c values in units similar to those that the patients see regularly through self-monitoring. 6 Using this formula, we calculated the eAG levels of our study group and investigated their relationship with the FPG levels. Surprisingly, the eAG levels were closely  associated with the FPG levels when the measurements were taken the same day. There was not only a strong correlation between the eAG and FPG levels, but their mean levels were also very similar (159.7 mg/dL and 159.4 mg/ dL, respectively). We at first thought that the eAG and FPG levels could be used interchangeably. It appeared that determining a patient's HbA1c level might be unnecessary if we could determine his or her FPG level because we could simply calculate it with the aforementioned formula. We decided to directly compare the eAG and FPG levels statistically. Although their mean levels seemed to be similar, they were actually significantly different (p = 0.001). Although we observed a significant difference between the average levels, this difference was not clinically meaningful. For 1567 samples, the eAG levels were lower than the FPG levels, whereas for 2324 samples, the eAG levels were higher than the FPG levels. These findings clearly demonstrate that the eAG and FPG values cannot be used interchangeably. We accepted the similar means of the eAG and FPG levels as a coincidence. This similarity in the FPG and eAG levels for the entire group disappeared when the subgroups were separated according to FPG level. In addition, the decrease in the significant strong correlation coefficient showed that the association depended on the patients' levels of glucose control. As glucose control worsened, the association became stronger.",

Sixty percent of patients had higher eAG levels than FPG levels. When we evaluated the eAG levels of patients in group C, we found that their eAG levels were lower than their FPG levels, in contrast with the findings for groups A and B (Table1).

Turkey, with approximately 70 million inhabitants, is a country where diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are moderately common, but awareness of diabetes remains poor. 10 It is thought that diabetic patients require better strategies to improve selfmanagement. 11 One of these strategies is the use of eAG levels together with HbA1c values. Although the clinical usefulness of eAG is not clear, 12,13 we believe that every patient's eAG level should be calculated and reported along with his or her HbA1c level. This strategy will help patients better understand the importance of keeping their blood glucose levels within acceptable limits and maybe will rescue them from some invasive approaches for glucose homeostasis. 14 ",
