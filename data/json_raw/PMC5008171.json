We reviewed 6533 MELD/PELD exception applications submitted between 2005 and 2008, calculated the variation in approval/denial rates, and followed these cases through mid-2013 to assess the effects on patient outcomes. We found highly significant regional variations in denial rates for appeals by exception patients and in transplantation rates. The odds of transplant for patients whose appeals are approved is 2.45 times that of patients not approved; that this effect does not vary by region suggests that the variation in transplant rates is driven, at least in part, by the variation in appeal denial rates. Health deterioration or death accounts for more than two-thirds of wait list removals among patients removed for reasons other than transplant. Our findings add to the weight of evidence that a national review board that uses current clinical expertise, peer review literature, and data to consistently assign priority could reduce regional inequities and move toward equitable allocation of organs and compliance with the",

            "text": "Regional review boards (RRBs) were created to address the concern that \"exception\" patientsthose with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) or pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD) score that does not accurately represent the severity of their medical illnessmight have a progressive disease that ultimately prevents them from obtaining a transplant or results in their dying on the liver transplant waiting list. In such cases, although scores are not elevated by the standard three components of the MELD calculation (creatinine, International Normalized Ratio, and bilirubin), the patient's advocate interprets their current medical condition as life threatening or believes that there is a risk of wait list removal due to progression of underlying disease. Currently, each of the 11 geographic regions in the United States has a separate RRB that assesses such cases. For certain specific conditions termed recognized exceptional diagnoses (REDs; including metabolic diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, hepatopulmonary syndrome, primary oxaluria, and familial amyloidosis), Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) policies allow exemptions from use of the true MELD/PELD scores to determine transplant priority, and provide guidelines for increases in the scores. With other conditions that are not specifically recognized by OPTN policies (non-REDs), it is possible for a physician to request an increased MELD score for any patient whose score is not thought to accurately reflect mortality risk. If the RRB approves, the patient may receive a higher MELD score and thus a higher wait list priority. However, there are no United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) guidelines for increases in the scores of patients with many of these non-RED conditions (including benign structural diseases such as cysts and adenomas, cholangitis in primary sclerosing cholangitis, and others). In the end, for all patients whose MELD/ PELD scores do not accurately reflect mortality risk, positions on the waiting list, wait list mortality, and wait list removals for medical illnesses that preclude liver transplant will depend on the judgment made by the RRB based on the expert opinions of RRB members.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, because of the lack of welldefined predictive models for estimating the risk of waiting list removal for non-RED conditions, RRBs across the United States have differed very considerably on which conditions should receive additional MELD points and on how exception case requests should be prioritized (1). Although it seems to be generally recognized in the transplant community that this results in considerable variation across UNOS regions in appeal denial rates for non-RED patients, data to actually prove this and determine the effects of denials on patient outcomes have been limited. A 2005 study found significant variation in the distribution of petitions for non-REDs per region (range 0.7-8.3%), the percentage of petitions approved among regions (range 28-75%), and the scores granted after review (2). However, this study did not assess the effect of denials on patient outcomes. A 2011 study that compared only symptom-based exception likelihoods across regions also found significant variation, with the regionspecific percentage of the study population receiving exception awards ranging from 1.5% to 6.2% (3). Transplantation occurred in 69% of patients with granted exception requests compared to 31% of patients with denied requests; only 17% of patients with granted requests suffered waiting list death or removal due to illness compared to 30% of patients with denied requests. Another 2011 study reported that the proportion of patients per region receiving non-HCC exceptions ranged from 3.7% to 9.5% and that patients receiving a MELD exception were transplanted at higher rates and dropped out at lower rates (4). Although it did not assess variation across UNOS regions, a 2013 study found that within individual UNOS regions, there were substantial betweencenter differences in the proportions of non-RED exception applications that were approved and that patients with approved non-RED exceptions were significantly more likely to undergo liver transplantation than patients with denied requests (68.3% vs. 53.4%) (5). To assess the specific outcome of RRB decisions on non-RED patient appeals across UNOS regions, we reviewed requests for non-RED MELD/PELD exception applications over three yr' time, calculated the variation in approval/denial rates and transplantation rates, and followed these cases through mid-2013 to assess the effects on patient outcomes.",

This analysis included all sequential initial applications as well as subsequent appeals of denied applications and three-month extensions for each patient included in the original RRB application. Any application that was in effect at UNOS during this time period but was submitted and approved prior to January 1, 2005, was excluded from this data extraction and analysis. Other exclusions included applications for HCC that did not meet the criteria in Policy 3.6.4.4, including patients with tumors outside the T2 criteria and patients with \"downstaged\" tumors, because regional variances addressed many of these patients. This analysis also excluded patients automatically not approved due to some administrative reason (e.g., missed extension deadline).",

To maintain consistency in the scoring system, one analyst completed the initial review process and scored each patient blindly, after which two additional analysts did separate reviews to confirm the scoring. The first review established a complete list of all diagnoses that were presented to the RRBs via electronic submission as the reason for the RRB appeal for MELD exception points. The second case review scored each case and each subsequent appeal, if applicable, and identified up to 10 \"exception\" diagnoses which were placed as the \"exception\" code(s) for each patient. These codes were either a specific medical diagnosis or a quality of life diagnosis. The third and final review then took place to establish a \"primary\" exception code because many patients had multiple diagnoses that were included in the appeal for review points and which could be a specific life-threatening disease, such as GI bleeding or infection. These patients would be scored using a \"composite\" code of multiple diagnoses. An example of the latter would be diagnoses such as GI bleeding and sepsis that could result in being discussed and possibly listed for transplantation with a primary exception score or being listed for retransplantation. These perceived life-threatening medical complications were presented to the RRBs when the patient's advocate determined that the singular or composite diagnosis could influence wait list mortality or wait list removal as too ill. After completion of this initial process, two additional analysts separately performed secondary validations of the scoring; one analyst reviewed the entire data set; the second analyst reviewed a randomly selected subset representing 10% of the patient cohort; both reviews confirmed the accuracy and consistency of the exception coding.",

Due to limitation in the sample sizes when stratified by both region and diagnosis, the analysis was limited to the three most common diagnoses for exception (ascites/hepatic hydrothorax, cholangitis/bacteremia, and bleeding). A generalized linear mixed-effects model with logit link function was fit for the outcome of RRB decision using region as a covariate; a second model was fit to adjust for the number of diagnoses designated as bases for exception as well as region. Both models include a random intercept grouped by patient ID to account for correlation between multiple applications from the same patient. All regions, including the region with no denials, were included in the mixed-effects modeling. Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess the overall significance of the variable Region.",

Patients were followed until July 5, 2013. The rates of removal due to transplant were computed, and homogeneity across regions in the rates was tested using a Pearson's chi-squared test. The rates were also computed conditional on the exception application status. Independence between RRB decision and removal for transplantation was assessed using a chisquared test for both the overall sample and within each region, and odds ratios comparing approved and denied patients were computed. P-values for the within-region tests were corrected using the Holm-Bonferroni method. A likelihood ratio test was used to assess the regional variation in the effect of application status on the odds of receiving transplantation. Mortality rates for exception approved and denied patients were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate; the difference in survival between the groups was assessed using the log-rank test. The hazard ratio for denied vs. approved patients was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Patients with Removal Code 8 in the OPTN database (indicating removal due to death) were recorded as having had the event; survival times for all other removal codes were treated as censored.

The latter was given particular prominence as an area of concern with the April 1998 publication by United States Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) of the \"Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network; Final Rule\" which specifically mandated that \"Neither place of residence nor place of listing shall be a major determinant of access to a transplant\" (6). At the time this rule was announced, HHS summarized its intent as being \"to assure that allocation of scarce organs will be based on common medical criteria, not accidents of geography\" (7).",

Although such discrepancies are widely observed and recognized in the transplant community, our study is one of only a handful of studies to both determine the regional variation in RRB approval rates and  show the serious consequences of this variation for the transplantation rates themselves, for which we also found strong evidence of substantial variation by region. It comes as no surprise that approved exception applicants were shown to have a statistically significant increase in the odds of transplantation, with their odds of receiving a transplant approximately two and one-half times that of patients not approved. We found that this effect does not appear to vary by region, suggesting that the variation in transplant rates is driven, at least in part, by the variation in appeal denial rates. We also clearly showed that among those patients who are eventually removed from the wait list for reasons other than transplant, a deterioration in health condition or death account for slightly more than two-thirds of removals. This highlights the accuracy of appeals to RRBs where the providers are predicting a high risk of death or medical deterioration where the patient may not survive until the liver transplantation using standard MELD criteria for organ allocation. Contrary to the opinion that has sometimes been expressed, only a small percentage of removals (12.6%) are the result of improving health.",

When considering the list of top five diagnoses within each region, refractory ascites and cholangitis appear in the lists for all 11 regions, while hepatocellular carcinoma and bleeding occur in ten and nine of the lists, respectively. Thus, in terms of diagnoses, the regions are fairly similar but not uniform. Estimation of the specific effect of regional differences in diagnosis types is an area for further study. Regional differences in severity may also have some effect on the observed phenomenon. While data on the severity for each case were not available, we did attempt to adjust for some measure of patient status by including the number of diagnoses listed as a covariate in the GLM analysis. While not ideal, this measure may capture some of the information on severity and may be considered a partial proxy. Looking at the overall results of our analyses, it seems very clear that, for some patients, accidents of geography are still a factor in determining transplantation outcome and, ultimately, survival.",

The three key concepts proposed for further consideration were Share 15 National, expedited graft placement, and tiered regional sharing and sharing threshold. Share 15 National and Share 35 Regional were implemented in June 2013. In Share 15 National, adult deceased donor livers are offered nationally to status 1 patients and patients with MELD 15 or higher before local/regional/national patients with MELD scores <15. In Share 35 Regional, adult deceased donor livers are offered to regional patients with MELD scores above 35 before local patients below a MELD score of 35.

As Share 15 National and Share 35 Regional have now been instituted, it will be important to re-assess data In the concept paper presented by the Committee in June 2014, it is clearly acknowledged that despite changes over the years, geographic variation in the level of medical urgency many candidates must reach to receive liver transplants has not been significantly reduced, with candidates in some parts of the country having to wait until they are much more severely ill compared to patients in other areas (9). One possibility suggested to decrease overall variation in MELD/ PELD scores at which candidates receive a transplant is organ distribution based on a limited number of allocation districts instead of the exist-ing local and regional boundaries. Statistical modeling shows that these optimized maps might reduce variation in the MELD/PELD scores at transplant and reduce both waiting list and total deaths. The Committee also proposed consideration of changing to a national review board, noting that, just as we have shown in our study, the current RRB system does not promote consistent reviews of the MELD/PELD scores nationwide.",

We suggest simultaneously moving toward super regional/national sharing concepts and, as has been proposed by the Liver and Intestinal Organ Transplantation Committee and other authors (2, 5), a national review board to replace the current RRB system for non-standard conditions which require MELD exceptions. Ideally, a national review board process that uses current clinical knowledge combined with standardized data collection methods and analysis protocols could assign priority on a consistent basis. A new program that includes a national policy with consistency in the medical criteria and scores assigned for non-RED conditions could help to prevent \"MELD creep\" or MELD inflation, greatly reduce regionally driven MELD inequities, and disincentivize today's situation in which some patients with resources (especially financial) pursue centers with high rates of approval for exceptions and shorter wait times. At the same time, data on transplant benefit and wait list removals for disease progression should be collected for each non-RED condition to improve the knowledge base with which guidelines can be developed. Ultimately, a rational approach to a national system created through changes in UNOS policy may be our best hope for equalizing the assignment of MELD exception points and providing equity for transplant candidates in all regions with the singular or composite medical illnesses that currently fall in the category of non-RED conditions.
