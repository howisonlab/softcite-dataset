We found that the silencing of TRB3 ameliorated metabolic disturbance and insulin resistance; myocardial hypertrophy, lipids accumulation, inflammation, fibrosis, and elevated collagen I-to-III content ratio in DCM rats were significantly decreased. These anatomic findings were accompanied by significant improvements in cardiac function. Furthermore, with TRB3 gene silencing, the inhibited phosphorylation of Akt was restored and the increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase in DCM was significantly decreased.",

Diabetes 60:2963-2974, 2011 D iabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), which occurs in patients with diabetes, carries a substantial risk concerning the subsequent development of heart failure and increased mortality (1). Different pathophysiological stimuli are involved in its development and mediate tissue injury leading to left ventricle (LV) systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Insulin resistance is considered to play a causal role in the pathogenesis and development of DCM (2)(3)(4). Insulin resistance is associated with increased LV mass (5) and deterioration of LV diastolic function (6). However, the underlying relevance of insulin resistance leading to altered myocardial structure remains incompletely understood.",

These observations have led to the suggestion that TRB3 elevation contributes to insulin resistance. TRB3 also serves as a molecular switch and regulates the activation of the three classes of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (11). TRB3 binds to and regulates MAPK kinase, thus controlling the activation of MAPK by incoming signals (11).

Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats (120-140 g) were purchased from the experimental animal center of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ji'nan, China). The animals were housed at 22\u00b0C with 12-h light-dark cycles. After 1 week of acclimatization, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT) were performed. The rats were then randomized into four groups: control, chow + streptozotocin (STZ), high-fat (HF) diet, and diabetes. HF and diabetic groups were fed an HF diet (34.5% fat, 17.5% protein, 48% carbohydrate; Beijing HFK Bio-Technology, China), and the other two groups received normal chow. Four weeks later, IPGTT and IPITT were performed again, and blood was sampled through the jugular vein. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting insulin were measured, and the insulin sensitivity index [ISI = ln(FBG 3 fasting insulin) 21 ] was calculated. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; 27.5 mg/kg i.p. in 0.1 mol/L citrate buffer, pH 4.5) to rats with insulin resistance. Rats in the chow + STZ group received the same dose of STZ. The control and HF groups received citrate buffer (intraperitoneally) alone. One week after STZ administration, rats with FBG .11.1 mmol/L in two consecutive analyses were considered the diabetic rat model. After 16 weeks of diabetes, rats were killed.

RT-PCR was performed using the following primers: b-actin, forward 59-AGA CCT TCA ACA CCC CAG-39 and reverse 59-CAC GAT TTC CCT CTC AGC-39; brain natriuretic protein, forward 59-GGG CTG TGA CGG GCT GAG GTT-39 and reverse 59-AGT TTG TGC TGG AAG ATA AGA3-9; TRB3, forward 59-TGA TGC TGT CTG GAT GAC AA-39 and reverse 59-GTG AAT GGG GAC TTT GGT CT-39; TNF-a, forward 59-CAC GCT CTT CTG TCT ACT GA-39 and reverse 59-GGA CTC CGT GAT GTC TAA GT-39; and IL-6, forward 59-ACC ACT TCA CAA GTC GGA GG-39 and reverse 592ACA GTG CAT CAT CGC TGT TC-39. Reactions were carried out on a real-time PCR thermocycler (IQ5 Real-Time PCR cycler; Bio-Rad), using SYBR green as fluorescence dye. Relative expression analysis involved the 2 2 \u25b3\u25b3CT method. Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was as described previously (22). We used antibodies against TRB3 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), collagen I, collagen III, TNF-a, IL-6 (Abcam), phospho (p)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/ERK, p-p38/p38 MAPK, p-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK)/JNK, and p-Akt/Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), followed by anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. TRB3, collagen I, collagen III, TNF-a, and IL-6 protein levels were normalized to that of b-actin as an internal control and phosphospecific proteins to that of total protein. Gene silencing of TRB3. Sixty rats were randomized to receive TRB3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or vehicle treatment. Gene silencing occurred immediately after the appearance of LV diastolic dysfunction. After 12 weeks of diabetes, both E/A and E9/A9 were ,1.0 as assessed by echocardiography in diabetic rats. Animals were then injected via the jugular vein with 2.5 3 10 10 plaque-forming units of an adenovirus harboring TRB3 gene (TRB3-siRNA) or a control empty virus (vehicle). Adenovirus transfer was repeated in 2 weeks. According to our present and previous studies (23), TRB3 level was increased in HF diet-fed and high fructose-fed rats. Previous studies have shown that insulin resistance was a hallmark of obesity (24) and metabolic syndrome (25). In light of the interaction between TRB3 and insulin resistance, we also investigated the effect of TRB3-siRNA on HF diet-induced cardiac injury. Four weeks after the first adenovirus injection, rats were killed. The heart was excised and weighed. Statistical analysis. Values are presented as mean 6 SEM. SPSS 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. Results were compared by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey-Kramer post hoc test and independent samples t test. A P , 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

The diabetic group showed the highest mean AUC on both IPGTT and IPITT ( Supplementary Fig. 1B2 and B4). Similarly, the chow + STZ and HF groups showed higher mean AUC on both IPGTT and IPITT compared with the control (P , 0.05) ( Supplementary Fig. 1B2 and B4). Total cholesterol, triglyceride, FFA, and FBG concentrations. The biochemical values are given in Fig. 1. After 4 weeks of an HF diet, serum triglyceride and FFA levels were significantly higher in the HF and diabetic groups than in the control and chow + STZ groups (P , 0.05). The ISI was markedly decreased in the HF and diabetic groups (P , 0.05). Insulin resistance appeared at week 4 in rats fed an HF diet. One week after STZ injection, FBG was remarkably elevated in the diabetic group and remained elevated until the end of the experiment. ISI consistently decreased in the diabetic group after the onset of diabetes. Simultaneously, in the diabetic group, serum total cholesterol, total triglyceride, and FFA levels were maintained at higher levels than the control (P , 0.05) during diabetes. Thus, the diabetic model induced by an HF diet and low-dose STZ was characterized by insulin resistance, moderate hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia, resembling the state of chemical diabetes in humans. LV dysfunction assessed by echocardiography and catheterization. We evaluated ejection fraction, FS, E/A, and E9/A9 to investigate changes in systolic and diastolic function. Similar to the pattern in humans, in rats, diastolic dysfunction precedes systolic dysfunction, beginning from 2 to 3 months after the induction of diabetes (26). In our study, at 6 weeks after the onset of diabetes (at week 11), the diabetic rats showed a moderate decrease in E/A and E9/A9 compared with the control (P , 0.05) ( Fig. 2E and F); LVEF and FS were impaired from week 17 ( Fig. 2C and D). At the end of the experiment, LVEF, FS, E/A, and E9/A9 were further decreased in the diabetic group, with the reduction in E/A and E9/A9 more pronounced. LVEF, FS, E/A, and E9/A9 were also reduced in the chow + STZ group compared with the control (P , 0.05) (Fig. 2C-F) at the end of the experiment.

TRB3 gene silencing improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. With TRB3 gene silencing, ISI was higher in the diabetic TRB3-siRNA group than vehicle (25.17 6 0.14 vs. 25.67 6 0.14, respectively; P , 0.05) ( Supplementary Fig. 3F).

            "text": "TRB3 is associated with insulin resistance, an important trigger in the development of DCM. We found TRB3 was involved in the pathogenesis of DCM. TRB3 gene silencing alleviated DCM mainly by modulating MAPK and Akt pathways in type 2 diabetes. Thus, TRB3 has a pivotal role in DCM and could be an attractive drug target for treating type 2 diabetes. TRB3, a critical mediator for insulin resistance, is implicated in DCM. The insulin-Akt signaling pathway regulates mitogenic effects in virtually all metabolic tissues, and proteins that inhibit Akt activity are considered potential inducers of insulin resistance (28). An example of such a protein is the catalytically inactive pseudokinase TRB3 (7). TRB3 is overexpressed in murine models of insulin resistance (7,8). In the current study, diabetic rats showed severe insulin resistance and increased TRB3 level. Akt activation was inhibited. These findings are in accordance with previous studies (7,8,28), which indicates insulin resistance exists in our type 2 diabetic rat model at the molecular level. In an insulin-resistant state, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /Akt pathway appears to be selectively blunted, compared with the fully activated MAPK pathway (29). This situation is known as pathway-selective insulin resistance (12). Kiss-Toth et al. (11) reported that TRB3 might be an important modulating protein of MAPK. We found TRB3 markedly upregulated in rats with diabetes, which was paralleled by increased ERK1/2 and JNK expression. Diabetic rats showed prominent collagen accumulation in interstitial and perivascular areas on Masson trichrome and Picrosirius red staining. Increased cardiac fibrosis, which can increase LV stiffness, is a common hallmark of DCM (30). Therefore, our diabetic rats showed severe DCM, which was further confirmed by elevated LVEDP. Previous studies have shown that activated MAPK plays an essential role in collagen synthesis and cardiac fibrosis (15,31). Therefore, activation of TRB3 may contribute to the development and progression of DCM, possibly mediated by the MAPK pathway.",

In light of the pivotal role of TRB3 in the development of DCM, we wondered whether downregulation of TRB3 could reverse the progression of DCM. According to our previous study (14), we used TRB3-siRNA in vivo in rats. TRB3-siRNA treatment produced no notable adverse effects and no deaths in rats. TRB3 mRNA levels were significantly decreased, and the protein expression was reduced by ;60% with TRB3-siRNA treatment in diabetic rats. Thus, global silencing of TRB3 was feasible and effective.",
