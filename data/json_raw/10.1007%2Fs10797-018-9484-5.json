            "text": "Contrary to frequent recommendations of the public finance literature and international institutions, a persistently high tax wedge on labor is observed in Europe. Simultaneously, the scope for shifting taxes to more growth-friendly revenue sources appears underused. This motivates our simulation of a tax shift from labor to property for Germany, a country where property tax revenues are particularly low and the tax wedge on labor income is among the highest in industrialized countries. We simulate a reform where property is no longer taxed by its (often) outdated cadastral value but by its market value, using the additional revenue to reduce social insurance contributions (SIC). To make such a simulation possible, we match property-related information with the input data of the tax-benefit microsimulation model EUROMOD. We find a considerable increase in property tax revenues, allowing to reduce the implicit tax rate on labor from 37.2 to 36.5%. Distributive effects tend to be modest and depend on the design of the SIC reduction. Overall, our results suggest that more households would gain than lose from the tax shift, with gainers mostly situated in the middle of the income distribution.",

            "text": "A high implicit tax rate on labor is often said to be detrimental to growth and employment (e.g., Arnold et al. 2011;Myles 2009). In general, the literature suggests that taxes levied on consumption or property are less distortionary and growth-harming than those levied on corporate or labor income (Mankiw et al. 2009;Slemrod 1990). Despite these findings, the scope for shifting taxes to more growth-friendly revenue sources appears underused in many countries. For instance, various institutions have frequently advised European governments to augment growth potentials by shifting the tax burden away from labor to other tax bases such as property (e.g., European Council 2015;OECD 2014;IMF 2013). Germany in particular has been identified as a country which makes only little use of property taxes, 1 while having a high implicit tax rate on labor (see Fig. 1). At the same time, the distribution of income and wealth has become more uneven in many advanced economies (including Germany) over the past few decades, and finding better ways to tax affluent households is back on the policy agenda of many governments (Atkinson and Piketty 2010;Peichl et al. 2010;Bach et al. 2009). Property constitutes the quantitatively most important wealth asset of German households, and the development of real estate prices has been found a crucial component of observed wealth inequalities (Lindner 2015).",

As a third scenario, we simulate a proportional reduction of social insurance contributions, again under revenue neutrality. All simulations are carried out using EUROMOD-the tax-benefit microsimulation model for EU member states. It allows us to evaluate changes in households' disposable income induced by the different scenarios. Our baseline simulations focus on first-order effects of the three reform scenarios. In addition, we also discuss the relevance of second-order effects in our context, and provide robustness checks in the Appendix accounting for potential labor supply responses.",

Examining distributive effects, our results first indicate that the (average) percentage increase in the property tax liability is roughly constant across the income distribution of property owners. Hence, the relative size of the property tax liability across the income distribution of homeowners is by and large preserved. Second, when examining the effect of the proposed update of cadastral values (again without redistributing the additional revenue) across the entire income distribution, we find that the relative change in disposable income varies little across income deciles. Thus, an update of cadastral values without using the additional revenue to lower the tax burden on labor would render such a reform virtually neutral in terms of redistribution.",

First, several proposals have been made to increase tax revenues from wealth and property (e.g., Bach et al. 2014;Piketty 2014). Our paper adds to this literature by assessing the revenue potential of an important policy tool, namely an up-to-date valuation of the property tax base. As mentioned above, outdated cadastral values determine property tax liability not only in Germany but also in several other European countries, making our results also relevant for other jurisdictions (see OECD 2014; Andrews et al. 2011). Furthermore, previous authors have pointed out that the redistributive element of the German property tax in its current form is rather limited (Bach and Schratzenstaller 2013). Our results support this view and indicate that this would not be substantially different once cadastral values are updated. In fact, our findings suggest that the potential for redistribution (if desired by the legislator) depends on the simultaneous reduction of the tax burden on labor.",

So far, little empirical work has been dedicated to property tax related simulations, mostly driven by data limitations. A notable exception is Moscarola et al. (2015), assessing labor market reactions to a property and labor tax reform in Italy. In a similar vein, Figari et al. (2017) investigate the fiscal and distributional consequences of including homeowners' imputed rent in personal taxable income as a kind of property tax for six European countries. Using up-to-date property values to determine property taxes could be regarded as an important complement (and maybe even as a substitute depending on the specific design) to housing income taxation. Finally, Kuypers et al. (2017) currently create a EUROMOD input database directly from the HFCS dataset. Their approach aims at broadening the scope of EUROMOD by including information on wealth from HFCS, but they do not combine this with EU-SILC data. The novelty of our paper is the creation of a new dataset via statistical matching that allows analyses regarding two variables which have never been jointly observed, namely the current property tax liability and the actual market value of the property. Our approach may potentially be extended to other European countries covered by EUROMOD, providing a fruitful avenue for further research.",

            "text": "As stressed above, Germany appears to have considerable scope to reform the valuation of property used for property taxation. Basic cross-country comparable descriptives underpin this view. Figure 1 illustrates large disparities across EU-28's member states with regard to revenue from property taxes and the implicit tax rate (ITR) on labor. Revenues from property taxes are comparatively low for Germany (0.44% of GDP vs. 1.5% in EU-28). At the same time, the ITR on labor in Germany is above average (37.2 vs. 36.1% in EU-28). So far, several attempts to reform German property taxation have been made, e.g., an overhaul of the Grundsteuer was part of the national Reform Program 2014 and 2015 but put on hold hitherto. As a consequence, the current valuation of property dates back to 1964 in Western Germany and to 1935 in Eastern Germany. Back then, rateable values 4 were assessed on the basis of capitalized gross returns (i.e., rental income) or, in the case of owner-occupied dwellings, on the basis of construction costs (for details see Spahn 2004). The original intention of the legislature was to update the property value on a regular basis, but this was never put into practice. 5 To make cadastral values comparable, even new buildings, sales or improvements in existing buildings are rated as if they were built several decades ago. Hence, the tax valuations of German properties differ substantially from current market values. 6 In sum, the link between the property tax liability based on outdated cadastral values and the actual market value of the real estate is very weak (Wissenschaftlicher Beirat BMF 2010).",

First, a sunset clause in the German Finanzausgleich-an equalization payment in the German multilevel government-makes its reorganization inevitable by the end of 2018. Since it is often argued that reforms of property tax regimes should be linked to reforms of intergovernmental fiscal frameworks (e.g., Devereux et al. 2007), we consider the sunset clause as a window of opportunity for an overhaul of property taxation in Germany. Second, two pertinent constitutional complaints (BvR 639/11 and 1 BvR 889/12) are currently pending before the Federal Constitutional Court. The court has to decide whether the continued failure to conduct a general reassessment of property values violates the equality-of-treatment clause of the constitution.",

In contrast, the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) provides detailed data on assets and liabilities, including the (self-assessed) value of real estates households own. 7 In line with Lindner (2015) and Zhan (2015), we find real estate as the quantitatively most important wealth component of German households.

The difference to record linkage, which uses, e.g., social security numbers to link identical units, is that statistical matching combines similar ones (R\u00e4ssler 2002). Statistical matching in our context allows for imputing the property value Y from HFCS (donor) to SILC (recipient) via a number of appropriate matching 6 Already in 1992 German fiscal authorities executed a comparison of selling prices with underlying cadastral values and found a ratio of ca. 5 to 1 (Bach and Bartholmai 2002). 7 Due to non-response, the most affluent households are likely to be underrepresented in the HFCS. This issue can be addressed by assuming that the upper tail of the wealth distribution approximates a Pareto distribution (Vermeulen 2016). However, this approach is not applicable for subordinate wealth components such as real estate. Importantly, real estate has been found one of the most accurately reported subordinate wealth components in HFCS, with a ratio of reported values in HFCS compared to national accounts amounting to 86% (Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Network 2013).

Although EU-SILC does not contain property values, it does provide information on whether a household owns property and how much property tax it pays. Through the careful selection of matching variables, we can assign respondents of EU-SILC (who do own property) the approximate market value of their property. Appendix A provides a detailed description regarding the choice of appropriate matching variables we use. 8 We apply a so-called hot deck matching procedure which assigns each observation in HFCS to at least one \"nearest neighbor unit\" in SILC that is most similar with respect to the matching variables. \"Nearest\" is defined as the associated observational unit that shows the smallest distance metric based on the set of matching variables. Specifically, we transform the data into uncorrelated, standardized variables with variance equal to 1 and then compute the Euclidean distance between two vectors x and y (McLachlan 2004).

Specifically, we use the variable property (market) value at time of acquisition (which we only observe in HFCS) as an instrument for the current property tax liability (which we only observe in SILC). The idea is that for survey respondents who acquired their property around the year of the last general assessment in 1964, the variable property value at time of acquisition should be highly correlated with the cadastral value of this property and thus with the current property tax liability. Hence, we can assess the quality of our matched dataset by comparing the (post-match) rank position of the property value at the time of acquisition with the rank position of the current property tax liability of these respondents. 10 To make this quality assessment valid, we restrict our analysis to households who acquired their property around the year of the last assessment, since the (market) value at the time of acquisition should come very close to the cadastral value of the property (we set an interval of \u00b1 5 years around 1964). 11 Further, we only use households whose only property is their main residence, since property value at time of acquisition is only inquired for the dwelling the household lives in. We find around 600 households in our sample who meet these restrictions, close to 10% of our total sample. Figure 3 presents a binned scatterplot of the mean rank position of the property value at time of acquisition versus the rank position of the current property tax liability. The rank-rank relationship is almost perfectly linear, suggesting that our matching procedure assigns the underlying property value to the current tax liability reasonably well. The relationship between the two ranks is measured via a Spearman's rho and yields \u03c1 = 0.74. Given that we have no information about improvements made to the property since 1964 (which would change the cadastral value of the respective property and hence its property tax liability), we consider this a sufficiently high degree of similarity. In sum, we conclude that our matched dataset should allow for valid inferences, especially on a more aggregated level such as income deciles. In the next section, we will run our simulations on this matched dataset.",

            "text": "Our policy reform simulations are performed on EUROMOD (version G2.0), the tax-benefit microsimulation model designed for EU member states. It applies national tax-benefit policy rules to harmonized microdata and calculates their effects on household disposable income (Sutherland and Figari 2013). Unlike computable general equilibrium (CGE) approaches, the only assumptions we impose concern our proposed reform scenarios, or the elasticity of labor supply. Our approach is in the spirit of recent research, for instance on fiscal sustainability (Dolls et al. 2017), income distribution analysis (Bargain et al. 2015), or mortgage interest deductibility (Figari et al. 2017). Thus, we follow well-established simulation techniques using EUROMOD,  1964). It presents a binned scatterplot of the relationship between a household's rank position of the property value at time of acquisition and a household's rank position of the current property tax liability using our matched dataset. To construct the figure, we split observations into 20 equal-sized bins based on the rank position of the current property tax liability and plot the mean rank position of the property value at time of acquisition within each bin (the y-axis). See text for details allowing for inferences about the distributional and revenue effects of a tax shift from labor to property. The German component of EUROMOD reproducing the 2010 German tax-benefit system has been validated through comparison with aggregate statistics provided by fiscal authorities (Ochmann and Granados 2011). We run all tax-benefit policy rules at their 2010 setting and then augment the model with a simulated change in property and labor taxation. Hence, our simulation model calculates household disposable income under the current as well as the reformed tax-benefit rules holding everything else constant and, therefore, avoiding endogeneity problems (Bourguignon and Spadaro 2006).",

This reflects the attempt to at least partly offset the nominally fixed cadastral values. However, using municipality tax multipliers to offset nominally fixed cadastral values does not provide a comprehensive remedy against outdated rateable values. For instance, any adjustment of the tax multiplier occurs on the municipality level only, and hence does not account for heterogenous developments of property values within a given municipality. 13 Federal tax rates have rarely been changed over the last decades and range from 0.26 to 0.35% for West Germany and from 0.5 to 1% for East Germany. The main reason why the federal tax rate differs between West and East Germany lies in the different reference year regarding the last assessment of rateable values (1964 for West and 1935 for East Germany, respectively). Simulated property tax reform We simulate a property tax reform in which the taxable base-the rateable value-is no more defined by the cadastral value of the property but by its current market value. Since the introduction and rise of the municipality multiplier after 1964 mostly reflects the fact that cadastral values were not adjusted to inflation, we do not apply them when calculating the new property tax liability. This is consistent with the idea to simulate a situation in which current market values (instead of cadastral values) determine property taxes due, which makes the use of inflation-Footnote 12 continued given that estimated labor supply responses in Germany are modest, and the SIC reduction in our simulations is small. offsetting multipliers redundant. Using current multipliers and current market values would lead to extremely inflated estimates of the new property tax liability. In contrast, not using multipliers when calculating the new property tax liability means that our simulation presents a more conservative estimate of the potential revenue effects of such a reform. Please note that we apply federal tax rates for West Germany to our entire sample, since the reason for the higher federal rate in East Germany is the different reference year regarding the last assessment (1935 instead of 1964), which becomes obsolete when using current market values for all German properties.",

The post-reform property tax liability for each household income decile is approximately three times larger, compared to a pre-reform situation. Hence, the relative size of the property tax liability across the income distribution of homeowners is by and large preserved under the proposed reform. (ii) Next we want to study the effect of the proposed update of cadastral values across the entire income distribution (regardless of being a homeowner or not). We start with scenario (1), which is the non-revenue-neutral simulation. The bars in Fig. 5 show the change in disposable income in absolute monetary values (EUR) by disposable income decile.

The triangles in Fig. 5, representing  in relative terms as affected by the update of cadastral values as richer ones. Thus, an update of cadastral values without redistributing the additional revenue would render such a reform virtually neutral in terms of redistribution. Previous authors have noted that the redistributive element of the German property tax is limited (e.g., Bach and Schratzenstaller 2013; Broer 2013). Our findings suggest that this would not change when cadastral values are updated. This motivates the analysis of our revenue-neutral reform scenarios (2) and 3, where the additional tax revenue is used to lower the tax burden on labor. Scenario (2) is a simulation in which the additional tax revenue of the proposed update of cadastral values is offset by a nonrefundable lump sum SIC credit. Such a lump sum SIC credit corresponds with a relatively high tax relief for low-income earners, whose contribution rate is reduced to a relatively greater extent. e 60 on average across the household income deciles, whereas the three top deciles loose between e 15 and e 209 on average. The triangles in Fig. 6 display the income change relative to disposable household income, ranging between + 0.43 and \u2212 0.40% for the single deciles. As a next step, we turn to our third reform scenario (3), in which the additional revenue is used to grant a rebate that is proportional to the SIC payment of an employee. Specifically, we simulate a 5.2% rebate on the social insurance contribution paid by the employee. The impetus for scenario (3) is that employees should enjoy a proportional reduction of their SIC payments. Figure 7 displays the income change relative to deciles of disposable household income under reform scenario (3). The figure indicates that the proportional rebate would have only small effects in terms of redistribution. With exception of the first decile, which clearly suffers, the average losses and gains per income decile do not exceed 0.2% of income. Similarly, absolute changes in disposable income across income deciles do not exceed e 50. In sum, it seems that middle-income households would profit to some extent from this reform scenario, whereas low-and high-income households slightly suffer. Figure 8 provides additional insights into the distributional effects of our simulations. For each of our two revenue-neutral scenarios, we now display the share of gainers and losers per disposable income decile. A household is defined as a gainer  Fig. 8 shows the result for reform scenario (2). We find more gainers than losers, with the share of losers increasing steadily with the income level. In contrast, the share of gainers is much more evenly distributed across income deciles. Turning toward scenario (3), we find again more gainers than losers, but this time losers are less concentrated in the upper part of the income distribution than under scenario (2). This mirrors our results of Fig. 7, suggesting that the proportional rebate would have only small effects regarding the income distribution. Please note the share of gainers generally exceeds the share of losers across all income deciles, except for the top income decile under scenario (2). In contrast, the mean change in disposable income is negative for three income deciles under scenario (2) (see Fig. 6) and for five income deciles under scenario (3) (see Fig. 7). Thus, we conclude that gains of the tax shift are modest but widespread, whereas losses tend to be bigger but less frequent. Finally, we want to assess overall changes in inequality associated with our three reform scenarios. For this purpose, we employ two widely used inequality indices, namely the Gini and the Atkinson with A \u03b5 = 1. In line with our previous results, we find the non-revenue-neutral scenario (1) to barely change the distribution of income (see Table 3). Regarding scenario (2), we observe a small reduction in income inequality. In contrast, scenario (3) would widen the income distribution, though only very slightly. Looking at changes in poverty thresholds (set at 60% of median disposable income), we barely find any effect of the three reform scenarios. However, this does not rule out that the proposed tax shift may generate significant gainers and losers. As the comparison of extensive margin (see Fig. 8) with the intensive margin (see Figs. 6, 7) already suggests, the worst off 1% might be affected by a considerable income shock in both scenarios (2) and (3). These scenarios could therefore potentially face opposition from asset-rich but income-poor households, which might ask for mitigating measures. This seems to be pertinent especially to the political acceptance of such a reform, given that the issue of property taxation can affect election outcomes (Bosch and Sol\u00e9-Oll\u00e9 2007).",

            "text": "The idea of higher taxes on land, capital and wealth to finance mounting public debt has gained ground in several OECD countries. At the same time, the scope for shifting taxes to more growth-friendly revenue sources appears underused in many European countries. This seems to be especially true for Germany, a country which makes only little use of property taxes, while at the same time having a high implicit tax rate on labor. Against this backdrop, we simulate a property tax reform for Germany which increases revenues from the taxation of property while simultaneously lowering the tax burden on labor. Changing the current property tax scheme based on outdated cadastral values to one based on market property values, we find substantial revenue effects of the proposed reform. Specifically, tax collection from private household property would increase from currently e 5.8 bil. to e 16.3 bil., allowing for an overall reduction of the implicit tax rate on Status Quo\" represents the pre-reform situation. \"Private property tax revenue\"depicts property tax revenues collected from private households, \"worst/best off 1 %\" depicts the mean percentage loss/gain in disposable income of the 1% most affected households labor from 37.2 to 36.5%. Using EU-28 cross-country levels as a comparison, this equates to an improvement of the implicit tax rate on labor by three positions. In contrast, the increase in the ratio of property tax revenue to GDP would change Germany's position by 13 places, with an after-reform level similar to Denmark's (compare Fig. 1). Examining the distributional effects of the reform on the household level, we find the update of cadastral values without using the additional revenue to lower SIC to be virtually neutral in terms of redistribution. As rich and poor households show comparable increases in the (relative) property tax burden, any potential redistribution under the proposed reform depends crucially on the design of the revenue-neutral SIC reduction. While a SIC reduction via a lump-sum tax credit would especially benefit low-income households, a SIC rebate proportional to households' current contributions would barely alter the overall distribution of disposable income. This gives policy-makers considerable scope via the specific design of such a reform.",

As a matter of fact, HFCS and EU-SILC have the same target reference population, namely all private households in Germany. Both surveys exclude all institutionalized population, i.e., people living in retirement homes, health care, religious, correctional and penal institutions. The reference units are defined as all age 16+ members currently living in the same household. Reference point for balance sheet items is in both surveys the date of interview. Interviews for EU-SILC were held between May 2010 and November 2010. The field work for HFCS data was conducted from September 2010 to July 2011. Both surveys use the same income reference period, which is 2009. Finally, due to the potential nonresponse bias, HFCS tries to oversample wealthier households. In contrast, SILC does not apply such oversampling. However, it is important to note that for Germany, we find one of the best data coherence between HFCS and EU-SILC among the 15 euro area countries regarding potential matching variables. For instance, the median annual gross income differs by less than e 100. This small difference in median annual gross income despite oversampling might reflect the very limited oversampling of HFCS in Germany. Oversampling in Germany was only based on geographic information about the distribution of taxable income, whereas other countries applied much more rigorous oversampling based on, e.g., wealth tax records. In sum, we conclude that regarding target population, household definition and reference period, the two survey designs appear to be sufficiently coherent to allow statistical matching.",

To be more precise, only HFCS units that own property are taken into account as only this subsample is liable to property taxation. This restriction reduces noise as it prevents the matching of property values to households not liable for property taxation. In a similar vein, we also restrict the recipient file to observations liable to property taxes. Figure 9 indicates that for quite some variables, the HD metric is below 5%. For instance, most of the demographic variables from both surveys show a strong degree of similarity regarding their distributions. Furthermore, total household (gross) income and contributions to private pension plans are very similar across both surveys. More importantly, variables capturing whether a person has rental income or tenure status are very evenly distributed in both surveys. Unsurprisingly, relatively low similarity is found for variables measuring welfare transfers. All other variables exceeding the 5% threshold are not used for the matching, as this would introduce noise to our analysis. Additional tests comparing weighted means by using simple t tests confirm our selection of suitable variables based on the HD metrics (results available upon request).",

According to D'Orazio et al. (2006), common variables for matching should be selected on the basis that they significantly explain the variation in the merger variable Y , that is the value of properties owned. As standard in the literature, the null hypothesis of no association between common variables and market value of property is tested. We run Rao-Scott tests, a correction of Chi-squared tests for contingency tables when the estimated cell proportions are derived from survey data (Rao and Scott 1981). In order to also provide a measure of strength of association between two variables, the Pearson correlation coefficients  Fig. 9 Comparing extensive margins of common variables.

Pairwise correlation coefficients are calculated allowing for sample design. Significance levels are based on survey-based variance estimates, with * and ** indicating significance at 5 and 1% levels, respectively are calculated. Table 5 shows results for the Rao-Scott test and Pearson correlation coefficient. 20 As depicted, 13 of the 19 variables that have been found to be similarly distributed across both surveys are also significantly correlated with our merger variable Y . When regressing the market value of property owned (= Y ) on such 13 variables, we obtain a R 2 of 0.64. Hence, based on overall coherence, similar distributions and sufficient predictive power, we select these 13 variables for statistical matching. Table 6 provides an overview of all variables considered for statistical matching, with the 13 variables finally selected for statistical matching shaded in gray (Figs. 10, 11).  use stylized values of labor supply elasticities estimated for Germany in order to account for second-order distributional consequences. We use values of 0.25 for female couples, 0.15 for male couples and 0.2 for singles, as reported in Bargain et al. (2014). The elasticities are estimated applying a flexible discrete choice model where couples are assumed to maximize a joint utility function over a discrete set of working hour choices. The utility function is specified to account for fixed costs of work, labor market restrictions, and preference heterogeneity with respect to age, the presence and number of children as well as unobserved heterogeneity components. We draw on their elasticity estimates, distinguished by sex and marital status. We then apply these elasticities in our simulations to infer the additional labor supply (and hence, labor income) of German households for our reform scenarios (2) and (3). 21 For the sake of simplicity and due to missing estimates, we assume the responses to be constant across income groups. Figures 12 and 13 replicate Figs. 6 and 7 from the main text, this time accounting for labor supply second-order adjustments. Since both reform scenarios lower the tax burden on labor, we find that on average households respond positively in terms of labor supply and gross income. For instance, when accounting for second-order effects, also the third highest income decile now gains on average reform scenarios (2) (see Fig. 6 and 6 for comparison). Overall, however, the differences to our baseline estimates are small. The additional gain in disposable income when accounting for second-order responses ranges between 0.01 and 0.12% across income deciles. Hence, the differences between our first-and second-order results appear to be small and do not qualitatively change our interpretation. This seems not surprising, given that estimated labor supply responses for Germany are modest (Bargain et al. 2014), and the SIC reduction in terms of annual income in our simulation is small. 22 If anything, accounting for labor supply responses turns more households into gainers when simulating our reform scenarios, making our first-order baseline a somewhat conservative estimate. Finally, Figs. 14 and 15 summarize the main distributional results under reform scenario (2) and (3). They contrast first-order results as depicted in Figs. 6 and 7 with results when accounting for behavioral responses as shown in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively. ",
