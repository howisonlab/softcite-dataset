Methods: We used high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to analyze genome-wide rare copy number variation (CNV) in a cohort of 144 children with AEs (95 CAE, 26 UAE, and 23 JAE). Results: We identified CNVs that are known risk factors for AE in 4 patients, including 3x 15q11.2 deletion. We also expanded the phenotype at 4 regions more commonly identified in other neurodevelopmental disorders: 1p36.33 duplication, 1q21.1 deletion, 22q11.2 duplication, and Xp22.31 deletion and duplication. Fifteen patients (10.5%) were found to carry rare CNVs that disrupt genes associated with neuronal development and function (8 CAE, 2 JAE, and 5 UAE). Four categories of protein are each disrupted by several CNVs: (1) synaptic vesicle membrane or vesicle endocytosis, (2) synaptic cell adhesion, (3) synapse organization and motility via actin, and (4) gap junctions. CNVs within these categories are shared across the AE subtypes. Conclusions: Our results have reinforced the complex and heterogeneous nature of the AEs and their potential for shared genetic mechanisms and have highlighted several pathways that may be important in epileptogenesis of absence seizures."

[8][9][10][11] We identify novel rare CNVs in a cohort of classical CAE and JAE cases, as well as UAEs with atypical seizure patterns or age at onset. The identification of shared genes and pathways could indicate common mechanisms for absence seizure generation.",

Highdensity single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays (HumanCoreExome-12 v1-0; Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used to detect the presence of CNVs from genomic DNA. Arrays were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize false-positives, CNVs were called using the Nexus Copy Number package (BioDiscovery Inc, Hawthorne, CA) from signal intensity data after preprocessing in Illumina GenomeStudio Software. In Nexus, systematic array correction files were used with the linear correction model to correct for GC bias, and a significance threshold of 1 3 10 27 was applied. The SNP-FAST2 Segmentation algorithm was used for analysis, with homozygous frequency threshold at 0.95, hemizygous loss threshold at 20.23, and single copy gain at 0.13 for the log R ratio. A total of 184 samples were processed on the arrays. Samples were removed from the project if they had 1 or more of the following: a ,95% call rate (0 samples), a probe-to-probe variability (quality) of .0.1 (15 samples), a sex mismatch (0 samples), and .100 CNVs (34 samples), leaving n 5 144. To avoid false-positives, only variants that contained .12 consecutive altered SNP probes and that were .20 kb in size were analyzed. CNVs showing .90% coverage of variants of a frequency of $0.1% of the same type, reported in the Database of Genomic Variants (http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home), using array comparative genomic hybridization or SNP arrays, were considered copy number polymorphisms and were excluded from further analysis (i.e., CNVs reported in this study are designated as \"rare\"). CNVs that did not overlap exons of a gene were also excluded. The potential for pathogenicity was based on gene content/disruption, CNV size, frequency, and previous association of genes or regions with epilepsy and related neurologic conditions.

However, more recent studies of the region indicate that mild intellectual disability (ID), autism, and seizures are common features in individuals carrying these duplications, 19 providing some evidence that this CNV may be a risk factor for the epilepsy in the individual described here. We also uncovered CNVs that are more commonly recorded in other neurodevelopmental disorders at 4 further recurrent regions. Only 1 patient with JAE and none with CAE have been previously reported with the 1q21.1 deletion. 20 The deletion leads to a variable phenotype, and seizures are seen infrequently, indicating the novelty of this region in a patient with CAE. We also identified 1 deletion and 1 duplication at Xp22.31, previously associated with MR and ichthyosis. Although seizures are now becoming a more widely reported phenotype, 21 absence seizures are not. 22q11.2 duplication syndrome has a variable phenotype, with MR and motor delay being the most common features. Seizures are reported rarely but are not well described apart from a recent case with continuous spikes and waves during sleep. 22 Lastly, we observed a 914-kb duplication of the distal end of Chr1 (1p36.33), which included the infantile spasm candidate KLHL17. 16 Duplications of 1p36.3 are less frequently recorded, are of variable size, and include developmental delay, seizures, and hypotonia with wide phenotypic heterogeneity and an overall \"milder\" phenotype than the reciprocal deletions. 23 It may be that the smaller number of duplicated genes in the patient described here, including KLHL17, could predispose to her JAE, but it is difficult to ascribe pathogenicity in such an isolated case. It seems from previous large-scale studies of the GGEs that variation at these recurrent regions is indeed rare within the AEs, but targeted studies in more patients could help to resolve this.",

The rare heterozygous CNVs seen here may cause the less severe syndrome of CAE, although very rare exonic deletions (0.04%) have been reported in the Database of Genomic Variants.

            "text": "Synaptic vesicles store and move neurotransmitters for release at the presynaptic membrane, and several proteins involved in vesicle release and recycling have been related directly to epileptogenesis 24 and are also enriched in CNVs from patients with infantile spasms. 16 In our investigation we identified 3 individuals with disrupted synaptic vesicle genes: AMPH, SV2C, and BTBD9. AMPH is involved in neuronal transmission and development through clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Amphiphysin 1 is also a substrate for CDKL5, a kinase associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as X-linked West (infantile spasms) syndrome and Rett syndrome. 25 SV2C acts via presynaptic calcium to regulate neurotransmitter release from vesicles in glutamatergic synapses. SV2C shows altered brain expression patterns in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, 26 and all 3 SV2 family members (A, B, and C) are candidates for epilepsy. 27 Lastly, BTBD9, a gene associated with restless legs syndrome and Tourette syndrome, may regulate synaptic plasticity via altered synaptic vesicle recycling. 28 Several mechanisms believed to contribute to epileptogenesis are likely to be regulated by cell adhesion, such as the dysregulation of GABAergic transmission, the guidance of axonal growth, and the stabilization of synaptic contacts and long-term potentiation (LTP). 29 Synaptic cell adhesion genes PCDH15, NLNG3, TENM3, and EPHA6 are disrupted by CNV in our study. The protocadherin PCDH15 mediates the formation, maturation, and specification of synapses and is a determinant of brain serotonin transporter expression. 30 Mutations of PCDH15 are known to cause Usher syndrome 1F, in which ID and psychiatric disturbances are common, and deletions are found in patients with epileptic encephalopathies. 31 The family member PCDH19 also causes X-linked infantile epileptic encephalopathy. 32 The postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule NLGN3 functions in synaptogenesis and neuron-glia communications and is a candidate for autism with comorbid epilepsy, in which it may influence seizure susceptibility. 33 The teneurin member TENM3 promotes cell adhesion and synaptic organization, similar to the role of neuroligins, and may also regulate excitatory synaptic strength via latrophilin binding. 34 Lastly, the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase EPHA6 also regulates neuronal cell adhesion, cell-matrix interactions (below), and migration, with clear roles in modulating synapse formation and plasticity and axon guidance. 35 A third category of genes that are disrupted in 3 patients with AE are those that organize the synapse and neuronal migration via the actin cytoskeleton. MPDZ controls large complexes at the synapse and is involved in learning-and memory-related synaptic plasticity. Its dysfunction has pleiotropic effects on vulnerability to seizures through interactions with many types of synaptic receptors. 36 The kinase CDC42BPB regulates cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration 37 and is involved in hippocampal LTP. Lastly, FMN2 mediates synaptic spine density and is highly expressed in the developing brain. FMN2 mutations can cause nonsyndromic ID. 38 Gap junctions, both between dendrites and between axons and glia, are highly implicated in synchronous seizure activity, and blocking communication at gap junctions is anticonvulsant. 39 Two gap junction proteins disrupted here, connexin Cxs32 (encoded by GJB1) and Pannexin1 (encoded by PANX1), are good AE candidates. Mutations in GJB1 cause X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, with some patients also showing CNS symptoms. 40 Cxs32 expression is also altered in the hippocampi of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. 41 Pan-nexin1 is upregulated in epileptic brain tissue and may contribute to seizures by increasing the levels of extracellular ATP. Targeting Pannexin1 improves seizure outcome in animal models. 42 Other GOIs that were disrupted by rare CNVs in patients with AE include NTRK2, a BDNF receptor that modulates excitatory transmission, synaptic plasticity, and hippocampal LTP and is required for epileptogenesis in animal models. 43 Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy show altered NTRK2 expression, 44 and dysregulated NTRK2-BDNF signaling is implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating its excellent candidacy for AE. The potassium channel interacting protein gene KCNIP4, deleted in a patient with JAE, forms part of a negative feedback loop in the Wnt/b-catenin pathway that regulates neuronal development and is a candidate for attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder. 45 Lastly, the autism risk factor gene MACROD2 was also disrupted in a patient with CAE. 18 A major limitation of our study is that it is a retrospective analysis of cohorts collected for previous genetic studies of AEs. This meant that we did not have useable DNA from family members to assess the inheritance of the CNVs and we were not able to recontact the families for collection of new DNA. Analysis of CNV inheritance would have aided in our putative assignment of pathogenicity to the CNVs, as those that were inherited with the disorder, or de novo in the probands, would be more likely to predispose to the epilepsy. We were also unable to access the original EEGs and the MRI reports of some patients, which would have allowed us to provide more detailed phenotypes in table 1. However, patients' diagnoses were ascertained both through the clinical services from which they were recruited and by experts in childhood epilepsies collating the cohorts for the initial studies; we therefore believe that other diagnoses have been sufficiently excluded, and further classification based on available data for our cohort is robust.",
