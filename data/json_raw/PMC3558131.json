            "text": "Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) plays a key role in reproduction. This decapeptide is synthesized and released by hypothalamus and induces the pituitary gonadotrop cells to release pituitary gonadotropin hormones. In some extrapituitary compartments GnRH and its receptor act as part of the autocrine regulatory system of cell proliferation. The anticancer activity of GnRH and its analogues has been observed by many researchers. In this study the anticancer activity of a new analogue of GnRH and triptorelin was investigated by cell proliferation assay. Results indicate that proliferation of human breast and ovarian cancer cell lines are dose-dependently inhibited. The inhibitory efficiency of the new analogue is proved to be higher than the original triptorelin. In addition to its antimitogenic activity, evidence was found for the involvement of the apoptotic mechanism in the action of the new analogue and triptorelin. In conclusion, the new analogue can be considered as a good pharmaceutical candidate."

            "text": "Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is the central regulator of the reproductive hormonal cascade. This decapeptide is synthesized and released by hypothalamic secretory neuron which is delivered to the pituitary gland via hypophyseal portal blood system. Interaction of GnRH with its receptors on the pituitary gonadotrop cells induces the release of pituitary gonadotropin hormones, which in turn regulate gonadal steroidogenesis and gametogenesis in both sexes (1) . Therefore, GnRH analogues have been used in the assisted reproduction (in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer), treatment of infertility due to polycystic ovarian diseases and fibroids. Also the efficiency of analogues of GnRH for the treatment of children with precocious puberty, endometrial carcinoma, estrogen-dependent breast cancer and prostate cancer is well established (2) . There is growing evidence of autocrine/ paracrine GnRH systems in human reproductive tissues (3)(4)(5)(6) . Recent studies suggest that about 50% of breast cancer and 80% of ovarian cancer cell lines express highaffinity binding site for GnRH and its analogues as part of the autocrine regulatory system of cell proliferation. Therefore anticancer activity of GnRH analogues has been observed by many others (7)(8)(9)(10)(11) .",

A powerful interest in medical applications of GnRH derivatives stimulated this undertaking. Thus, the intense activity that has occurred in this field was caused by the desire to synthesize super active analogue with prolonged biologic activity. Many agonistic and antagonistic analogues more potent than the parent hormone have been made. Several of these analogues such as triptorelin, goserelin, leuprorelin and buserelin are being used clinically and the list of their applications is steadily expanding (2) .",

Among them is insertion of some chemical groups in the peptide sequences to increase their activity efficiency. In the present work the anticancer activity of a new GnRH analogue was investigated in comparison with triptorelin. The new analogue structure is similar to triptorelin with two extra chemical groups inserted between Leu7 and Arg8 in order to increase peptide hydrophobic properties ( Figure 1). Based on previous report on the molecular mechanism of ligand interaction with the GnRH receptor (14) , the hydrogen bonding and \u03c0-stacking interaction play main roles in GnRH and its receptor interaction. Therefore we expect stronger interaction between new analogue and GnRH receptor leading to greater peptide activity.",
