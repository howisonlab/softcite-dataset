            "text": "Human acute and inflammatory pain requires the expression of voltage-gated sodium channel nav1.7 but its significance for neuropathic pain is unknown. Here we show that nav1.7 expression in different sets of mouse sensory and sympathetic neurons underlies distinct types of pain sensation. Ablating nav1.7 gene (SCN9A) expression in all sensory neurons using Advillin-Cre abolishes mechanical pain, inflammatory pain and reflex withdrawal responses to heat. In contrast, heat-evoked pain is retained when SCN9A is deleted only in nav1.8-positive nociceptors. surprisingly, responses to the hotplate test, as well as neuropathic pain, are unaffected when SCN9A is deleted in all sensory neurons. However, deleting SCN9A in both sensory and sympathetic neurons abolishes these pain sensations and recapitulates the painfree phenotype seen in humans with SCN9A loss-of-function mutations. These observations demonstrate an important role for nav1.7 in sympathetic neurons in neuropathic pain, and provide possible insights into the mechanisms that underlie gain-of-function nav1.7-dependent pain conditions."

Advillin is an actin-binding protein that is selectively expressed within all trigeminal and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons 12,13 . We used Cre driven by the Advillin promoter to delete Nav1.7 in all sensory neurons 14 , and compared phenotypes with mice in which Nav1.7 is deleted using Cre driven by Nav1.8 in a subpopulation of sensory neurons (Nav1.7 Nav1.8 ) 11 . Wnt1 is expressed in neural crest cells that are the precursors of sensory and autonomic neurons 15 . This has allowed us to exploit a Wnt1-Cre mouse 16 to examine the contribution of Nav1.7 to pain behaviour in both the sensory and sympathetic neurons, where it is selectively expressed 17 . We have thus been able to define the pain modalities associated with different sets of peripheral neurons that express Nav1.7. We provide evidence that Nav1.7 may be involved at both the central as well as the peripheral terminals of sensory neurons in pain signalling. We also demonstrate an interaction between sympathetic and primary sensory neurons in acute heat sensing as well as neuropathic pain, which are both dependent upon Nav1.7 activity. These experiments provide a comprehensive mouse model of human CIP for mechanistic studies and reinforce the significance of Nav1.7 as an analgesic drug target.",

The expression pattern of functional Cre was first examined by crossing an Advillin-Cre knock-in-positive mouse line 14 with Rosa26 floxedstop \u03b2-galactosidase-expressing reporter mice 18 . X-gal staining of E14.5 Advillin-Cre-positive reporter (Advillin-Cre + / \u2212 ) mice embryos showed that Cre expression is confined to the DRG and trigeminal neurons (Fig. 1a,b), while no staining is seen in Advillin-Cre-negative reporter mice. Positive X-gal staining was seen in all DRG cells in sections taken from 6-week-old-Advillin-Cre + / \u2212 reporter mice ( tissues sampled, including the superior cervical ganglia (SCG- Fig. 1d). This X-gal staining seen in Advillin-Cre + / \u2212 reporter mice corroborates previous studies of expression patterns using in situ hybridization and human placental alkaline phosphatase reporter mice 12 . The expression pattern of Wnt1-Cre has been reported 16 , and was confirmed by crossing Wnt1-Cre-positive mice with Rosa26 floxed-stop \u03b2-galactosidase reporter mice. Positive X-gal staining was seen in both DRG and SCG isolated from Wnt1-Crepositive reporter mice (Fig. 1e,f). A count of cells with positive staining for antibodies to neurofilament N200 protein (a marker of A-fibre-associated sensory neurons- Supplementary Fig. S1a,b) as well as peripherin (a marker of nociceptive sensory neurons- Supplementary Fig. S1a,b) shows no neuronal loss in Advillin-Cre + / \u2212 mice ( Supplementary Fig. S1c).",

Similarly, mechanical sensitivity developed normally in response to surgically induced neuropathic pain (Fig. 2f). The same acute pain tests as described above were performed on Wnt1-Cre-expressing mice, which showed responses similar to wild-type littermate controls (Supplementary Fig. S2a-f).

            "text": "By comparing the pain behaviour of different mouse lines, it was possible to examine the role of Nav1.7 expressed in Nav1.8-positive sensory neurons (Nav1.7 Nav1.8 ), all sensory neurons (Nav1.7 Advill ) or sensory and sympathetic neurons (Nav1.7 Wnt1 ). Analysis of the behavioural responses of Nav1.7 Nav1.8 Nav1.7 Advill and Nav1.7 Wnt1 mice in a number of different pain models showed that their pain phenotypes differ. Fig. 3a shows that all three Nav1.7 knockout mouse strains show pronounced analgesia in terms of noxious mechanosensation measured with a Randall-Selitto apparatus, when compared with their littermate controls. This confirms the findings of Nassar et al. 11 , who examined the Nav1.7 Nav1.8 mouse. The Randall-Selitto test results suggest that deleting Nav1.7 within Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons is sufficient to abolish responses to mechanical pain. However, the results of the acetone (noxious cooling) test ( Fig. 3b) and Hargreaves' (thermal: spinal withdrawal reflex) test ( Fig. 3c) show deficits in the Nav1.7 Advill and Nav1.7 Wnt1 mice, while the behavioural response of Nav1.7 Nav1.8 was not significantly different from littermate controls (confirmed by separate behavioural tests- Supplementary Fig. S4a,b). Thus, noxious cooling-evoked behaviour and spinal withdrawal reflexes to noxious heat require Nav1.7 expression in Nav1.8-negative sensory neurons. However, this is not true for supraspinal responses to the hotplate test ( Fig. 3d-discussed below). Other work supports the view that Nav1.7 expressed within Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons contributes little to thermal nociceptive processing. Abrahamsen et al. 21 showed that behavioural responses to noxious thermal stimuli (with the exception of extreme cold) remain intact in mice in which all Nav1.8-positive neurons have been ablated with diphtheria toxin (Nav1.8 DTA ). Additionally, in vivo electrophysiological recordings from spinal lamina V wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in Nav1.7 Advill Nav1.7 Nav1.8 and Nav1.8 DTA mice corroborate the behavioural data. Critically, WDR responses in Nav1.7 Advill mice show that both noxious heat and mechanical stimuli are attenuated (Fig. 3e,f). In contrast, only mechanically evoked and not heatevoked WDR responses are attenuated in both Nav1.7 Nav1.8 mice 11 and Nav1.8 DTA mice 21 . This demonstrates clearly that Nav1.7 expressed in Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons is essential for processing noxious mechanical stimuli while Nav1.7 in Nav1.8-negative DRG neurons is essential for processing noxious thermal stimuli. Nav1.7 is expressed in sympathetic as well as sensory neurons 2,17 . By using the Wnt1 promoter to drive Cre expression it is possible to delete genes in neural crest derivatives including autonomic and sensory neurons. Therefore, we could identify any role for Nav1.7 in sympathetic neurons by comparing the phenotype of Nav1.7 Advill and Nav1.7 Wnt1 mice. Interestingly, only Nav1.7 Wnt1 mice have an attenuated response to the hotplate test ( Fig. 3d), which is a measure of supra-spinal responses 22 to damaging thermal stimuli rather than a spinal reflex involving only cells in the spinal cord 23 . In contrast, Nav1.7 Advill (as well as Nav1.7 Nav1.8 ) mice show normal hotplate pain behaviour (Fig. 3d). However, this does not mean that Nav1.7 in sympathetic neurons alone confers sensitivity to the hotplate test. Chemical sympathectomy using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) 24 in wild-type mice has no effect on behavioural responses to the hotplate test ( Fig. 3g) or any other acute pain thresholds tested ( Supplementary Fig. S5a-f). However, when chemical sympathectomy is combined with the deletion of sensory neuron Nav1.7 in Nav1.7 Advill mice, the hotplate response is diminished ( Fig. 3h). Thus, only when Nav1.7 expression is lost in both sensory and sympathetic neurons do mice become unresponsive ( Fig. 3d). Despite the role of the sympathetic nervous system in thermoregulation, the core temperature and skin temperature of Nav1.7 Wnt1 ( Fig. 4a) and 6-OHDA-treated mice ( Supplementary Fig. S5g) were found to be normal.",

Interestingly, the Nav1.8 knockout mouse responded to acetone-induced cooling in the same way as littermate control mice ( Fig. 4b), but showed an attenuated response to extreme cold (Fig. 4c). In contrast, all three Nav1.7 conditional knockout mouse lines that showed attenuated responses to acetone-induced cooling ( Fig. 3b) avoided extreme cold like their littermate controls ( Fig. 4d). Thus, noxious cold sensation is not Nav1.7 dependent. Finally, all three Nav1.7 knockout mouse lines showed normal responses to light touch and motor coordination (Fig. 4e,f), reinforcing the link between Nav1.7 and pain rather than innocuous somatosensation.",

Nav1.7 Advill DRG neurons showed a significant average reduction in tetrodotoxin (TTX)sensitive sodium current amplitude, whereas TTX-resistant sodium currents were unchanged (Fig. 5a). Complete current-voltage relationships are shown in Fig. 5b,c. Approximately 30% of small DRG neurons have been shown to be electrically silenced by the deletion of Nav1.7 in Nav1.8-positive DRG neurons 25 . We found that electrically stimulated polysynaptic peripheral input into spinal lamina V WDR neurons no longer resulted in wind-up ( Fig. 5d)-an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated form of long-term sensitization that requires substance P release from sensory neurons 26 . Substance P release from sensory neurons was therefore measured in Nav1.7 Advill mice. Strikingly, electrical stimulation of isolated sciatic nerve roots failed to induce increased substance P release into the dorsal horn of Nav1.7 Advill mice (Fig. 5e).",

Interestingly, Nav1.7 Advill mice show a large phase I behavioural deficit (~50% decrease in behavioural responses) whereas Nav1.7 Nav1.8 mice 11 and Nav1.8 DTA mice 21 do not.

            "text": "Neuropathic pain requires Nav1.7 in sympathetic neurons. Previously Nassar et al. 11 showed that Nav1.7 Nav1.8 mice develop neuropathic pain normally. Thus, Nav1.7 expressed in Nav1.8-positive neurons, while making a major contribution to inflammatory pain, does not contribute to neuropathic pain 11 . Importantly, Nav1.8 DTA mice also develop neuropathic pain normally, showing that Nav1.8-positive neurons are not required for the development of neuropathic pain 28 . However, recently a blocker of inactivated Nav1.7 has been claimed to reverse mechanical hyperalgesia associated with neuropathic pain models 28 . This suggests a possible contribution to neuropathic pain of Nav1.7 expressed in Nav1.8-negative DRG neurons, which remain intact within Nav1.7 Nav1.8 mice. Therefore, Nav1.7 Advill mice in which Nav1.7 is lost in all sensory neurons were examined. Nav1.7 Advill mice developed mechanical hypersensitivity to the same extent as normal littermates, following spinal nerve transection (SNT) at the fifth lumbar segment-a model of neuropathic pain [29][30][31]  (Fig. 6a). Thus, Nav1.7 in sensory neurons is not required for the development of neuropathic pain. In contrast, Nav1.7 Wnt1 mice show a pronounced attenuation in the development of mechanical sensitization and return to baseline behaviour ( \u00b1 10%) within 10 days following surgery (Fig. 6b). This set of observations demonstrate that Nav1.7 expression in sympathetic neurons is essential for the establishment of neuropathic pain. An important role for sympathetic neurons in neuropathic pain is further demonstrated by the ability of a chemical sympathectomy to partially alleviate mechanical hypersensitivity in Nav1.7 Wnt1 littermate mice following SNT (Fig. 6c). In these experiments, neuropathic pain was established for 28 days, followed by chemical sympathectomy. A substantial, if incomplete, reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity was observed consistent with a sympathetic sensory interaction contribution to the establishment of neuropathic pain. These results may help explain the apparent utility of Nav1.7 antagonists in treating neuropathic pain 27 .",

We found that TTX-sensitive current densities were reduced in sensory neurons that no longer express Nav1.7. More surprisingly, we found that substance P release into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord evoked by electrical stimulation was completely abolished in the absence of Nav1.7, leading to a loss of wind-up and centrally mediated pain sensitization. In the olfactory system, Weiss et al. 10 have shown that while olfactory neurons support action potential propagation in the absence of Nav1.7, the release of neurotransmitter from olfactory neurons is completely abolished, leading to anosmia. A similar deficit may occur in DRG sensory neurons. Thus, Nav1.7 may contribute to pain signalling by DRG neurons in three ways: (1) by recruiting Nav1.8 to transmit noxious input into the spinal cord 1,2 ;",

Nav1.7 expressed in Nav1.8-positive nociceptors is not required for the development of neuropathic pain in mouse models 11 , and the studies reported here show that Nav1.7 deletion in all sensory neurons also does not significantly impair the development of neuropathic pain. As the number of CIP patients is very limited, there is no information on the importance of Nav1.7 for the development of neuropathic pain in humans. We wondered if Nav1.7 in the sympathetic nervous system contributed to neuropathic pain, as early studies in rodents 33 had made a compelling case for a sympathetic contribution to this type of pain. Interestingly, ablation of Nav1.7 in both sensory and sympathetic neurons markedly diminished neuropathic pain in the SNT model investigated here 29,30 . This observation demonstrates an interaction between sympathetic and sensory neurons to produce neuropathic pain that is represented schematically in Fig. 7. Interestingly, pain behaviour evoked by the hotplate test is also dependent on Nav1.7 in sympathetic and sensory neurons. Behavioural responses to the hotplate test have been shown to be supraspinally integrated 22,23,34 . A number of experimental manipulations specifically affect the hotplate behavioural response, but not reflex heat-evoked behaviour (typically tail-flick) [34][35][36][37] . Animals in which nerve growth factor (NGF) depletion leads to loss of sensory and sympathetic neurons also show a loss of hotplate sensitivity while mechanical thresholds and thermal reflex behaviour are unaffected 38 . NGF is not required for the survival of parasympathetic neurons 39 . This is consistent with a role for sympathetic neurons rather than other autonomic neurons in this pain behaviour. Silencing sympathetic and some sensory neurons by deleting VGLUT2 with Cre recombinase driven by the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter also causes a loss of hotplate sensitivity while acute mechanical pain remains intact 40 . In contrast, selectively deleting VGLUT2 using Nav1.8-Cre results in a behavioural phenotype where mechanical pain behaviour is lost while thermal pain remains intact 41 . These findings directly mirror the behavioural phenotypes associated with selective deletion of Nav1.7 within different neuronal subpopulations (Fig. 7). The role of the sympathetic nervous system in pain pathways has been confirmed in some rat models of neuropathic pain 33 . Clinical studies have also shown a role for the sympathetic nervous system in acute human pain, for example, post-surgical pain 42 . General interest in the role of the sympathetic nervous system in pain pathways has diminished because sympathetic block has little effect in many human studies 26 . Our results suggest that a combination of sensory and sympathetic block may prove to be more effective in treating some pain states than a sensory block alone, perhaps because complete sensory block may be hard to achieve. How sympathetic and sensory neurons interact to enhance pain sensations is unclear; interactions at nerve terminals, cell bodies and centrally have all been invoked as possible mechanisms 43 . Interactions between sympathetic neurons and the neuronal somata of DRG neurons (Dogiel's arborizations) have been described in normal animals since the era of Ram\u00f3n y Cajal 44 . Sprouting and specific interactions with sensory neurons by sympathetic neurons have been observed in several chronic pain models and recently quantitated with reporter mice 45 . Complex regional pain syndrome characterized by chronic burning pain and flushing in limbs supports the view that sympathetic input may contribute to pain, although the role of Nav1.7 has not been explored in this condition 26 .",

            "text": "How do these findings relate to known human Nav1.7-dependent pain pathologies? It is striking that the principal sensation associated with all gain-of-function Nav1.7 mutations is burning pain. A possible explanation for this is that the heat-sensing subset of Nav1.7-expressing (Nav1.8 negative) sensory neurons show lower thresholds of activation than the Nav1.7-expressing Nav1.8-positive set of classical nociceptors linked to noxious mechanosensation. Interestingly, sympathetic block is effective in the treatment of some erythromelalgia cases, consistent with a contribution by sympathetic neurons to acute heat sensing (Bang et al. 46 and references therein). Overexpression studies of gain-of-function Nav1.7 erythromelalgia-associated mutant channels in SCG neuronal somata have shown diminished excitability of sympathetic neurons, although it is unclear if lower physiological levels of Nav1.7 expression also silence sympathetic neurons. 8 PEPD is also characterized by a burning pain evoked principally by mechanical stimuli. The association of PEPD with paroxysms of rectal, ocular or sub-mandibular pain with flushing could be related to the sympathetic contribution to this condition. 2 The Harlequin-like nature of flushing also implicates the autonomic nervous system (see, for example, Drummond and Lance 47 ). Age-related alterations in autonomic nervous system function could also be a factor in time of onset of primary erythromelalgia, which is remarkably variable in different patients 48 . Finally, the ability to abolish all pain modalities in mice that fail to express Nav1.7 in the periphery provide a useful model of CIP for mechanistic studies, and confirms the utility of mouse models of human disease for mechanistic studies. These data confirm the potential of Nav1.7 as an analgesic drug target not only for acute and inflammatory pain but also for neuropathic pain.",

Briefly, animals were acclimatized to the test chambers before testing.Rotarod: Animals were placed onto the Rotarod at 4 r.p.m., which was then accelerated to a maximum of 40 r.p.m. within 90 s, with a cutoff of 120 s. Hargreaves' thermal test: The animal's hindpaw was exposed to an intense light beam and the withdrawal latency recorded. Hotplate: Animals were exposed to either a 50\u00b0C or a 55\u00b0C chamber floor and the withdrawal latency recorded. Thermal Place Preference (BioSeb, France) was used to assess cold avoidance. Von Frey: The up-down method described by Chaplan et al. 52 was used to  11,21 Formalin: second phase 11,21 Nav1.8+ Inflammatory hyperalgesia 11,21 Heat: supraspinal Formalin: first phase Figure 7 | The neuron-specific role of Nav1.7 in different pain states. nav1.7 expressed in nav1.8-positive sensory neurons (blue) is required for mechanical pain as well as inflammatory thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia 11,21 . nav1.7 expressed in nav1.8-negative neurons (red) is required for thermal acute pain sensing (but not extreme cold, which is dependent on nav1.8 4,21 ).

The TTX-sensitive sodium current was determined as the current that was sensitive to block by 500 nM TTX and was obtained by digitally subtracting the TTX-resistant component from the total inward current. The current density was obtained by dividing the peak current by the cell capacitance as read from the amplifier. Current densities were obtained by dividing the current at each potential by the cell capacitance as read from the amplifier."
