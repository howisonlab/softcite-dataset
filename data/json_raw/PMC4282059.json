            "text": "Background: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the relationship between the chloride content of intravenous resuscitation fluids and patient outcomes in the perioperative or intensive care setting. Methods: Systematic searches were performed of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) databases in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Randomized clinical trials, controlled clinical trials and observational studies were included if they compared outcomes in acutely ill or surgical patients receiving either high-chloride (ion concentration greater than 111 mmol/l up to and including 154 mmol/l) or lower-chloride (concentration 111 mmol/l or less) crystalloids for resuscitation. Endpoints examined were mortality, measures of kidney function, serum chloride, hyperchloraemia/metabolic acidosis, blood transfusion volume, mechanical ventilation time, and length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) and confidence intervals were calculated using fixed-effect modelling. Results: The search identified 21 studies involving 6253 patients. High-chloride fluids did not affect mortality but were associated with a significantly higher risk of acute kidney injury (RR 1\u22c564, 95 per cent c.i. 1\u22c527 to 2\u22c513; P < 0\u22c5001) and hyperchloraemia/metabolic acidosis (RR 2\u22c587, 1\u22c595 to 4\u22c521; P < 0\u22c5001). High-chloride fluids were also associated with greater serum chloride (MD 3\u22c570 (95 per cent c.i. 3\u22c536 to 4\u22c504) mmol/l; P < 0\u22c5001), blood transfusion volume (SMD 0\u22c535, 0\u22c507 to 0\u22c563; P = 0\u22c5014) and mechanical ventilation time (SMD 0\u22c515, 0\u22c508 to 0\u22c523; P < 0\u22c5001). Sensitivity analyses excluding heavily weighted studies resulted in non-statistically significant effects for acute kidney injury and mechanical ventilation time. Conclusion: A weak but significant association between higher chloride content fluids and unfavourable outcomes was found, but mortality was unaffected by chloride content.",

            "text": "The administration of intravenous fluids for resuscitation occurs routinely in the perioperative setting and in the management of critically ill patients. There has been considerable interest in defining optimal fluid resuscitation strategies 1 , yet practice patterns and fluid selection vary considerably 2 . While much attention has been directed at the 'colloid versus crystalloid' debate, increasing evidence suggests clinically important differences related to intravenous fluid chloride content 3 -7 . Often referred to as 'normal saline', 0\u22c59 per cent saline contains sodium and chloride in supraphysiological concentrations. Balanced solutions, in contrast, contain significantly lower concentrations of sodium and chloride, making them closer in composition to plasma than 0\u22c59 per cent saline 6 . Despite a lack of evidence supporting the superiority of 0\u22c59 per cent saline 7 , it is commonly used as a resuscitation fluid and has generally served as the 'control fluid' in large trials 8,9 . Administration of 0\u22c59 per cent saline causes hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis 10 -15 , and consequently some guidelines recommend the use of balanced solutions as a default during resuscitation 16 . Hyperchloraemia has also been associated with decreased renal perfusion 17 -21 , impaired immune function 22 -24 and mortality 25 , suggesting that hyperchloraemia may have clinically relevant effects.",

A recent systematic review 29 of prospective RCTs evaluated the impact of near-isotonic or isotonic crystalloids on acid-base status and other physiological, haemodynamic and clinical outcomes. However, no analyses have focused specifically on the chloride content of crystalloids administered for resuscitation in the broader context of both perioperative and critical care medicine. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine whether the chloride content of resuscitation fluids used in the operating theatre or intensive care unit (ICU) setting is associated with differences in outcomes.",

P < 0\u22c5050 was considered to be statistically significant. reports P values to one or two significant digits; where requested, a standard normal (Z) table was consulted to report P values to three decimal places 37 . For each endpoint analysed, statistical heterogeneity was examined using the I 2 statistic, which provides an estimate of the percentage of variation across studies arising from study heterogeneity rather than chance 38 . When substantial heterogeneity (I 2 greater than 60 per cent) was detected for an endpoint showing a statistically significant effect of highversus low-chloride fluids, this heterogeneity was further investigated using a random-effects analysis model or subgroup analysis, as appropriate. When visual inspection of a forest plot suggested that the overall effect was driven by a single study (weight greater than 50 per cent), sensitivity analysis excluding this study was performed 39 .",

High-chloride crystalloids were associated with a significantly increased risk of AKI/renal failure (RR 1\u22c564, 1\u22c527 to 2\u22c513; P < 0\u22c5001) ( Fig. 3) and hyperchloraemia/metabolic acidosis (RR 2\u22c587, 1\u22c595 to 4\u22c521; P < 0\u22c5001) ( Fig. 4). AKI/renal failure outcomes were defined by criteria set forth by the individual studies and were not uniform. For both mortality and AKI/renal failure, heterogeneity, estimated by the I 2 statistic, was 0 per cent, suggesting a consistent direction and magnitude of effect across studies. For hyperchloraemia/metabolic acidosis, each study indicated a RR greater than 1 (range from 2\u22c512 to 16\u22c537), but the overall heterogeneity (I 2 = 61 per cent) led to a re-examination of the association using a random-effects model. This re-examination did not meaningfully change the RR (4\u22c507, 95 per cent c.i. 1\u22c523 to 13\u22c553; P = 0\u22c5022), suggesting that the observed heterogeneity was probably due to differences in effect magnitude rather than effect direction. Examination of ICU and/or hospital LOS revealed no significant association between chloride content and ICU LOS (SMD \u22120\u22c501, 95 per cent c.i. \u22120\u22c510 to 0\u22c509; P = 0\u22c5897; I 2 = 0 per cent) ( Fig. S3, supporting information).

This endpoint was driven heavily by one study 26 , and sensitivity analysis excluding this study showed the same direction of effect, but loss of statistical significance. Each remaining study demonstrated a directionally similar association between increased AKI/renal failure and high-chloride fluids. One limitation in interpreting these data is the lack of uniformity among definitions of AKI. Ideally a standardized definition would be applied for the analysis; however, this was not possible with the available data. Moreover, serum creatinine concentration, a surrogate marker of renal function, did not demonstrate an association with the fluid chloride content. Failure to detect such an association may be related to reporting of serum creatinine levels at variable time points, and the possibility that the magnitude of differences in serum creatinine concentration may vary with time.",

Shaw and co-workers 27 also demonstrated an association between high-chloride fluids and greater transfusion volume, but the study was not included in the analysis owing to lack of variability data. Although the total number of patients included in the present meta-analysis of blood transfusion volume was low (high-chloride, 102; low-chloride, 100), the potential for a true difference raises relevant questions. Clinicians may consider any difference meaningful given the expense and risks associated with red cell transfusions 61,62 . Although causality has not been established between high-chloride fluids and increased transfusion, the potential clinical impact of a true effect is hypothesis-generating.",

Total volumes of fluid administered did not vary substantially between the groups (Table S3, supporting information), suggesting that dilutional coagulopathy does not account for the observed differences in transfusion. Mechanisms of saline-induced coagulopathy are not fully known, and the data lead us to consider whether hyperchloraemia/acidosis has an independent effect on coagulation. Alternatively, a reverse association cannot be excluded, in that fewer transfusions may have been administered in the low-chloride groups owing to the possibility of incompatibility with citrated blood. However, in two 46,54 of the four studies, the low-chloride solution did not contain calcium, and in one 14 of the other studies the providers were blinded to the fluid that was being administered.",

Despite inclusion of observational studies, the total number of patients remains low and several outcomes were examined in only a small number of studies. Further limitations include variability in the populations studied, the potential for significant bias in observational studies, and variability in outcome assessment.
