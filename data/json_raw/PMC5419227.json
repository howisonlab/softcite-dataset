            "text": "Background: Recent studies indicate an increased incidence of pertussis disease in recent years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the acellular vaccine for children (as a replacement of current whole cell vaccine in the Expanded Program on Immunization) and for high-risk adults in Iran through updating current best available evidence. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review in relevant databases we focused on previously published systematic reviews to select those that address our questions. The AMSTAR (assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews) tool was used for screening available reviews. Then search in databases was done until Feb 2014 to update the evidence. We pooled results using meta-analysis methods by Stata statistical package. Results: Eleven systematic review articles were included in the initial evaluation. In the end, two systematic reviews on acellular vaccine booster doses and the acellular vaccine in children were selected as the baseline evidence. In the update phase, new clinical trials were screened, and the results were updated. Overall pooled estimate of relative efficacy of acellular to whole cell was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.55-0.81) for children immunization Pooled estimates for the efficacy of acellular versus placebo were 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.80). Overall pooled estimate of efficacy of booster dose of acellular was 0.87(95% CI, 0.85-0.88) compared to placebo. In addition pooled estimate of acellular vaccine efficacy based on response to antigen was 0.78(95% CI, 0.64-0.93) in highrisk group. Conclusion: The results show higher performance and safety of the acellular vaccine in the prevention of pertussis in children versus the whole cell vaccine. Moreover, the efficacy of the acellular vaccine in high-risk adult groups is acceptable. This study provides evidence in favor of the introduction of an acellular vaccine to the national program of immunization. Studies on cost effectiveness and aspects of policy analysis are recommended.",

            "text": "Whooping cough is an acute bacterial respiratory disease, caused by Bordetella pertussis. It can be transmitted through nasal and pharyngeal discharges. This disease has a high degree of virulence. Also the bacteria has a high attack rate (80-100%) (1). Immunization against whooping cough is widely coverage by whole-cell vaccine which was developed in the 1940s (2). Most of the whole-cell vaccines are mixed with Diphtheria and Tetanus toxoids, undesired chemicals like endotoxins which are side products of whole cell vaccines cause side effects for this kind of vaccines. Due to growing concerns about the neurologic disorders related to whole-cell vaccines, Acellular vaccines were produced and tested in 1970 and were used in 1980 in Japan (3,4). Increasing in the incidence of pertussis in adolescents suggesting that the immunity by the acellular vaccine may be more efficient than whole-cell vaccine (5), although according to the technical advisory group on vaccine-preventable diseases (TAG), countries that are using whole-cell vaccine should not switch to an acellular vaccine. Similarly, countries currently using acellular should not switch back to the use of whole-cell until more evidence is available to support changes in vaccination strategies for pertussis (5). In Iran, in spite of vaccination program covering more than 90% of the population, reports show an increasing trend of incidence rate in some years which may be due to lack of control in adults (6). This study was designed and performed in order to reach the best estimation of vaccine efficacy and also as an introduction to cost-effectiveness analysis of acellular vaccination in Iran for providing strong evidence for health policy makers.",

In the mentioned review study, major and minor side effects were studied in 52 clinical trials in 136541 children and cumulative efficacy of the acellular and whole-cell vaccines were compared in various doses. Study indicated that risk ratio (RR) of major side effects as death, encephalopathy, seizures and hypo-tonic posture in the first dose of acellular vaccine compared to the whole cell vaccine were 0.97 , 0.00 , 0.47 , 0.26 respectively and risk ratio in minor side effects like anorexia, prolong crying and high fever were estimated 0.43, 0.17, 0.15 respectively. These numbers increased slightly in the next doses (8). Assessing acellular vaccine was considered because of fewer side effects than whole cell vaccine, especially neurologic side effects. On the other hand, the limitations of using whole cell vaccine in adults as well as not making a lifetime security by using whole cell vaccine in children causing poor control of the disease, incidence of disease in adults and transmission of it to other groups in a society are known. There are studies in this field , for example, Pertussis incidence rates in two decades in the United States has increased steadily while during the process that vaccination rates among children were high. During the years 1997 to 2000, most of the cases, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were infants (55.5%) and patients of 10 to 19 years old (29%). But in 2005, 60% of the reported cases were among adolescents of 10 to 18 years old (46) from the reasons of increasing in this disease reports, upgrade of diagnostic procedures and increase awareness about the disease was noted. However, many studies have shown that immunity after vaccination decreases over time and protection may only be 10 to 15 years which this can increase the number of susceptible individuals among adolescents and adults. The study conducted by Nikbin et al. (6) in the ministry of health in Iran indicated that the number of susceptible and diagnosed whooping cough patients is recently increasing. The reasons for this increase in the article were the same as we mentioned here. It has been described that most cases have been confirmed among children due to the less attention of the disease among adults. In a review study by Rodriguez (19) in 2012, the clinical efficacy of direct and indirect (herd immunity) of vaccine booster dose with different strategies was evaluated and calculated. Twenty one observational studies entered into the analysis and were estimated using mathematical modeling. Direct result of the vaccination (reduction of the incidence was 37-64% in adolescents and 39-50% in adults vaccinated) was estimated, and indirect effects or community immunity (18-22% reduction in the incidence of disease in adolescents and 33% in adults) was calculated.",

Control of disease in high-risk groups such as pregnant women to maintain safety in infants and employees of the health system as a factor for infection and transmission also had been considered. This point makes us remember the importance of booster dose in adults. In most cases, the disease incidence in adults is directly related to epidemiology in health care workers (21,22) .In a study conducted by Wright et al. in 1992 among emergency room staff, a serological survey showed that despite high immunization coverage in children, antibody levels were low in the majority of employees. This caused this group to be at high risk for infection and subsequent transmission of pertussis to susceptible individuals. The incidence of Bordetella pertussis among health professionals was 3.1% at 95% confidence level (CI) (5.3%-0.00) among 106 physicians, 6.3% at 95% CI (6.9%-0.00) among the physicians and nurses of emergency department (19).",
