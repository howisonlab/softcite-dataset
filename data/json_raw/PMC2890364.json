RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We studied 16 nondiabetic adults and 16 subjects with type 1 diabetes during euglycemia (blood glucose 4.5 mmol/l) and hypoglycemia (blood glucose 2.5 mmol/l). Markers of inflammation, thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction (soluble P-selectin, interleukin-6, von Willebrand factor [vWF], tissue plasminogen activator [tPA], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP], and soluble CD40 ligand [sCD40L]) were measured; platelet-monocyte aggregation and CD40 expression on monocytes were determined using flow cytometry. RESULTS-In nondiabetic participants, platelet activation occurred after hypoglycemia, with increments in platelet-monocyte aggregation and P-selectin (P \u0545 0.02). Inflammation was triggered with CD40 expression increasing maximally at 24 h (3.13 \u03ee 2.3% vs. 2.06 \u03ee 1.0%) after hypoglycemia (P \u03ed 0.009). Both sCD40L and hsCRP (P \u03ed 0.02) increased with a nonsignificant rise in vWF and tPA, indicating a possible endothelial effect. A reduction in sCD40L, tPA, and P-selectin occurred during euglycemia (P \u03ed 0.03, P \u0545 0.006, and P \u03ed 0.006, respectively). In type 1 diabetes, both CD40 expression (5.54 \u03ee 4.4% vs. 3.65 \u03ee 1.8%; P \u03ed 0.006) and plasma sCD40L concentrations increased during hypoglycemia (peak 3.41 \u03ee 3.2 vs. 2.85 \u03ee 2.8 ng/ml; P \u03ed 0.03). Platelet-monocyte aggregation also increased significantly at 24 h after hypoglycemia (P \u03ed 0.03). A decline in vWF and P-selectin occurred during euglycemia (P \u0545 0.04). CONCLUSIONS-Acute hypoglycemia may provoke upregulation and release of vasoactive substances in adults with and without type 1 diabetes. This may be a putative mechanism for hypoglycemia-induced vascular injury.",

Although attributed to reduced capillary blood flow causing localized ischemia (1), greater exposure to hypoglycemia may have worsened microangiopathy through its putative effects on local vasculature (2). In addition, cardiovascular stress associated with hypoglycemia may precipi-tate acute macrovascular events in a diseased circulation. While supported by anecdotal reports (3), the increase in cardiovascular mortality in people with type 2 diabetes in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial (4) (and possibly in the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial [5]), in which intensive treatment had tripled the frequency of severe hypoglycemia, has caused concern.",

A retrograde-intravenous cannula for blood-glucose sampling was inserted into the nondominant hand, which was heated to arterialize the venous blood (14). A cannula in the nondominant antecubital fossa was used to infuse 20% dextrose and soluble insulin (Human Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Crawley, U.K.) at a constant rate of 1.5 mU/kg/min using a Gemini PCI pump (Alaris Medical Systems, San Diego, CA). The dextrose was infused at a variable rate depending on arterialized blood glucose concentrations, which were measured at 5 min intervals using the glucose oxidase method (2300 Stat; Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH). A third cannula in the other antecubital fossa was dedicated to blood sampling for inflammatory markers.",

Conversely, P-selectin decreased during euglycemia. Endothelial function, using vWF and tPA Ag as surrogate markers, may have been disrupted, as shown by the increase in vWF after hypoglycemia in nondiabetic volunteers, but this change was not replicated in those with diabetes. However, a reduc- tion in vWF occurred after euglycemia in diabetic participants, which should confer vascular benefit. tPA Ag also appeared to increase in nondiabetic subjects during hypoglycemia, while declining during euglycemia, whereas no significant changes occurred in the diabetic group. Soluble markers of inflammation, sCD40L and hsCRP, were higher during hypoglycemia, with an elevation of hsCRP being observed in all subjects. Unfortunately, baseline differences in hsCRP in nondiabetic subjects, and in sCD40L in the diabetic subjects, frustrated interpretation of subsequent responses. sCD40L was apparently reduced during euglycemia in nondiabetic participants. Surprisingly, IL-6 increased in all experiments regardless of glycemic status, with a maximal response at 6 h. This response is inexplicable, and contrasts with a previous report (10). Monocyte CD40 expression also increased, suggesting promotion of the interaction of the CD40-CD40 ligand dyad (from the tumor necrosis factor receptor family), thus affecting another process in the pathway leading to atherosclerotic plaque rupture (19,20). This change occurred much earlier in the diabetic than the nondiabetic subjects, in whom the response was delayed, prolonged, and still present at 24 h. The persistence of these vascular changes for 24 h after the hypoglycemic stimulus, or their later emergence, suggests that the period of risk after hypoglycemia may be present long after blood glucose recovery.",

Because the baseline levels of many inflammatory markers can differ on separate days, as was observed with sCD40L and hsCRP, this biological variability hinders the interpretation and comparison of subsequent results. However, the present study design was necessary to allow comparison of the euglycemia and hypoglycemia conditions in individual subjects, as both time and insulin infusion per se may exert effects on biomarker levels. This study design cannot control for other dayto-day factors that could influence baseline levels of inflammatory markers. However, the effects of hypoglycemia could be evaluated, as each participant acted as their own control. This produces less variability than a comparison of results among individuals, as more interindividual variation in inflammatory marker levels is present than intraindividual variation. In addition, it was possible to analyze each study separately, by examining changes in parameters from baseline on that particular day, enabling the detection of significant effects exerted by hypoglycemia compared with euglycemia. Baseline levels of all markers (except IL-6) were higher in the diabetic group (significant for P-selectin and CD40 expression). This could affect the magnitude of response induced by the experimental procedures.

Euglycemia may have a protective, anti-inflammatory effect. In the present study, the participants had no overt vascular disease and were unlikely to develop any demonstrable effects from a short period of exposure to hypoglycemia. However, in people with diabetes of long duration, who are likely to have underlying vascular disease, these responses may not be benign. The release of potent vasoactive substances could potentially aggravate chronic vasculopathy, and contribute to the precipitation of acute macrovascular events. This may aggravate established diabetic micro-and macrovascular disease in those who are exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia.",
