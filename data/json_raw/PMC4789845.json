            "text": "MiR-381 has been reported to be dysregulated in several human cancers. However, the function and mechanism of miR-381 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. In the present study, the miR-381 expression was assessed in a cohort of 113 CRC specimens using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTq-PCR), which demonstrated that miR-381 was significantly downregulated in CRC and correlated with distant metastasis and tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage. Functional study revealed that restoration of miR-381 significantly inhibited the invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells. Luciferase reporter assay validated that Twist1, an important EMT inducer, was a direct target of miR-381, and rescued Twist1 attenuated the function of miR-381 in CRC cells. Correlation analysis also revealed an inverse correlation between miR-381 and Twist1 expression levels in CRC specimens. Taken together, our results highlight the significance of miR-381/Twist1 interaction in the development and progression of CRC, and suggest that restoration of miR-381 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the patients with CRC.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most malignant and leading causes of cancers worldwide. 1,2 Although there has been substantial progress in the treatment for patients with CRC, approximately half of them die within 5 years, mainly due to metastasis; 3,4 thus, further investigation into the underlying molecular mechanisms is of great clinical significance. Recently, increasing reports have revealed the close relationship between dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) and the development of CRC, which highlights the role of miRNAs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in patients with CRC. [5][6][7] miRNAs are a class of short and noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes by directly binding their 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR), leading to the posttranscriptional translation inhibition or mRNA degradation. 8,9 In CRC, many miRNAs have been found to be involved in the regulation of multiple cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. 10 For example, miR-143 and miR-145 function as tumor suppressors by inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, 11,12 while miR-21 acts as an important promoter of oncogenesis. 13,14 CRC pathogenesis is particularly accompanied by the epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) that is considered the primary step in distant metastasis of many types of cancer, the major concern in clinical cancer therapy. 15,16 Recent findings showed that miRNA is important in regulating the EMT process in CRC. [17][18][19] Therefore, identification of EMT-associated miRNAs as biomarkers or therapeutic targets is of great importance.",

Using TargetScan and miRanda tools online, we screened several invasion-and migration-related genes by RTq-PCR, of which Twist1 expression was significantly repressed in miR-381 expressing HT29 and SW480 cells. In addition, Twist1 is an important inducer of EMT, which is involved in cell invasion and migration ability, 24,25 and hence we focused on Twist1 in the study. To validate if miR-381 directly targets Twist1 3\u2032UTR ( Figure 3A), luciferase reporter assays were performed in HT29 and SW480 cells, which revealed that miR-381 mimics significantly decreased the luciferase activity of wild-type Twist1 3\u2032UTR reporter, but had no effect on the Twist1 3\u2032UTR reporter with mutant miR-381 binding seed sites ( Figure 3B). RTq-PCR and Western blot also validated that miR-381 mimics reduced Twist1 expression, and miR-381 inhibitor mimics increased Twist1 expression in HT29 and SW480 cells ( Figure 3C and D). Moreover, RTq-PCR analysis revealed that Twist1 expression was significantly increased in CRC tumors compared with paired normal mucosal tissue ( Figure 3E) and inversely correlated with the expression levels of miR-381 in CRC tissues used in the study ( Figure 3F). Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-381 directly inhibits Twist1 expression in CRC cells.",
