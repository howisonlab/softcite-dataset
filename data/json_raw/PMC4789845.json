            "text": "MiR-381 has been reported to be dysregulated in several human cancers. However, the function and mechanism of miR-381 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. In the present study, the miR-381 expression was assessed in a cohort of 113 CRC specimens using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTq-PCR), which demonstrated that miR-381 was significantly downregulated in CRC and correlated with distant metastasis and tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage. Functional study revealed that restoration of miR-381 significantly inhibited the invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells. Luciferase reporter assay validated that Twist1, an important EMT inducer, was a direct target of miR-381, and rescued Twist1 attenuated the function of miR-381 in CRC cells. Correlation analysis also revealed an inverse correlation between miR-381 and Twist1 expression levels in CRC specimens. Taken together, our results highlight the significance of miR-381/Twist1 interaction in the development and progression of CRC, and suggest that restoration of miR-381 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the patients with CRC.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most malignant and leading causes of cancers worldwide. 1,2 Although there has been substantial progress in the treatment for patients with CRC, approximately half of them die within 5 years, mainly due to metastasis; 3,4 thus, further investigation into the underlying molecular mechanisms is of great clinical significance. Recently, increasing reports have revealed the close relationship between dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) and the development of CRC, which highlights the role of miRNAs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in patients with CRC. [5][6][7] miRNAs are a class of short and noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes by directly binding their 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR), leading to the posttranscriptional translation inhibition or mRNA degradation. 8,9 In CRC, many miRNAs have been found to be involved in the regulation of multiple cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. 10 For example, miR-143 and miR-145 function as tumor suppressors by inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, 11,12 while miR-21 acts as an important promoter of oncogenesis. 13,14 CRC pathogenesis is particularly accompanied by the epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) that is considered the primary step in distant metastasis of many types of cancer, the major concern in clinical cancer therapy. 15,16 Recent findings showed that miRNA is important in regulating the EMT process in CRC. [17][18][19] Therefore, identification of EMT-associated miRNAs as biomarkers or therapeutic targets is of great importance.",

Briefly, the cell lines were plated in 96-well plates (3,000 per well), and allowed to grow for 24, 48, and 72 hours, then assessed by a colorimetric assay using MTT solution (10 mg/mL) at 570 nm. Cell invasion ability assay was performed using transwell invasion chambers coated with matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Cells were suspended in FBS-free medium and added to the upper chamber, while the medium containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber. After 24 hours of incubation, the cells remaining on the upper membrane were removed with cotton wool, whereas the cells that had invaded through the membrane were stained with methanol and 0.1% crystal violet, imaged, and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cell migration ability was assessed by performing wound healing assays. Cells were cultured to 100% confluence, and wounds were generated using pipette tips. The cells were then cultured for 24 or 48 hours and the wound closure was assessed by Scion Image Software (Scion Image Beta 4.03; Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA).",

Using TargetScan and miRanda tools online, we screened several invasion-and migration-related genes by RTq-PCR, of which Twist1 expression was significantly repressed in miR-381 expressing HT29 and SW480 cells. In addition, Twist1 is an important inducer of EMT, which is involved in cell invasion and migration ability, 24,25 and hence we focused on Twist1 in the study. To validate if miR-381 directly targets Twist1 3\u2032UTR ( Figure 3A), luciferase reporter assays were performed in HT29 and SW480 cells, which revealed that miR-381 mimics significantly decreased the luciferase activity of wild-type Twist1 3\u2032UTR reporter, but had no effect on the Twist1 3\u2032UTR reporter with mutant miR-381 binding seed sites ( Figure 3B). RTq-PCR and Western blot also validated that miR-381 mimics reduced Twist1 expression, and miR-381 inhibitor mimics increased Twist1 expression in HT29 and SW480 cells ( Figure 3C and D). Moreover, RTq-PCR analysis revealed that Twist1 expression was significantly increased in CRC tumors compared with paired normal mucosal tissue ( Figure 3E) and inversely correlated with the expression levels of miR-381 in CRC tissues used in the study ( Figure 3F). Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-381 directly inhibits Twist1 expression in CRC cells.",

In the present study, we showed that miR-381 was significantly downregulated in a cohort of 113 CRC and five CRC cell lines, which was consistent with a recently published report on miR-381 in colon cancer. 23 In addition, we found decreased miR-381 expression was significantly correlated with distant metastasis and high TNM stages. These findings suggest that miR-381 may function as a tumor suppressor in CRC. We then investigated the functional roles of miR-381 in CRC cell lines. To do so, we constructed miR-381 expressing HT29 and SW480 cells. MTT, transwell with matrigel, and wound healing assays revealed that miR-381 could inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, and migration ability of HT29 and SW480 cells. Combined with the recent observation that miR-381 inhibited the cell proliferation and invasion in colon cancer, 23 we concluded that miR-381 acts as a tumor suppressor in CRC. This was also consistent with previous findings that miR-381 suppressed breast, 20 pituitary, 21 and prostate cancers. 22 However, another report revealed that high expression of miR-381 in gliomas was involved in pathological malignant progression, suggesting miR-381 as a tumor promoter in gliomas. 26 All these observations suggest that the role of miR-381 might vary in different types of cancer.",

We found Twist1 was a direct target of miR-381 by the luciferase reporter assay. To confirm the interaction of miR-381 and Twist1 in CRC, we performed RTq-PCR on Twist1 expression in CRC tissues and found a significant inverse correlation between their expression levels in clinical CRC. In addition, functional study revealed that Twist1 knockdown significantly inhibited the invasion and migration ability of HT29 and SW480 cells, and rescued Twist1 in miR-381 expressing HT29 and SW480 cells dramatically attenuated miR-381-induced inhibition on cellular migration and invasion. Taken together, our data suggest that Twist1 is a functional target of miR-381 in CRC cells.",

This was validated by our observation that miR-381 increased epithelial marker E-cadherin and inhibited mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin. Moreover, this phenomenon was dramatically attenuated by rescued Twist1 in miR-381 expressing HT29 and SW480 cells. These data suggest that miR-381 is a potential EMT inhibitor, at least partially, by targeting EMT inducer Twist1 in CRC cells.",
