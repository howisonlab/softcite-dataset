The aim of this study was to determine the effects of NUTRIOSE \u00ae on cecal parameters, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations, and fecal excretion in rats. In an initial experiment, twenty-four male Fischer F344 rats were randomly assigned to one of the following four treatments for 14 days: G0 (control diet), G2.5 (control diet + 2.5% of dextrin), G5 (control diet + 5% of dextrin), and G10 (control diet + 10% of dextrin). After 14 days, total cecal weight, cecal content, and cecal wall weight were significantly increased in G5 and G10 compared to G0. At the same time, cecal pH was significantly lower in G10 compared to G0. Total SCFA concentration was significantly higher in G10 than in G5, G2.5, and G0, and significantly higher in G5 than in G0. Acetate, butyrate, and propionate concentrations were significantly increased in G5 and G10 compared to the controls. In a second trial based on a similar design, eighteen male Fischer F344 rats were treated with a control diet supplemented with 5% of dextrin or 5% of fructo-oligosaccharide. The results obtained with NUTRIOSE \u00ae were similar to those obtained with the fructo-oligosaccharide. In a third experiment, two groups of 5 Fischer F344 rats were orally treated with 100 and 1,000 mg/kg NUTRIOSE \u00ae , respectively, and from 18% to 25% of the dextrin was excreted in the feces. The results of these three studies show that the consumption of NUTRIOSE \u00ae , by its effects on total cecal weight, cecal content, cecal wall weight, pH, and SCFA production, could induce healthy benefits since these effects are reported to be prebiotic effects."

            "text": "Prebiotics are defined as non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the health of the host by selectively stimulating the growth and activity of specific species of bacteria in the gut [1]. Fibre-rich diets are considered to be protective against weight gain, cardiovascular disease, and colon cancer, and have beneficial effects on the human gastrointestinal tract [2][3][4][5]. In the second part of the last century, fibre intake decreased due to the evolution of food habits and is currently relatively low as compared to dietary recommendations (ANC \"Apports Nutritionnels Conseill\u00e9s\" for the French population or recommended nutrient intakes). One way to increase fibre intake without increasing energy intake, is to replace some full-energy nutrients by low energy constituents, such as dietary fibres. Among them, and according to the new definition of dietary fibres published by Prosky 2001 [6], non digestible oligosaccharides (fructooligosaccharides, galactosaccharides, etc.) and resistant dextrins are two different types of fibres. The presence of their specific linkages (\u03b2, \u03b11-2, \u03b11-3...) does not permit the hydrolysis of these indigestible dextrins in the small intestine of mammals, and their energy content can be available for colonic flora. In the colon, they are fermented by intestinal bacteria. This bacterial fermen-tation in the colon leads to the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), mainly acetate, propionate, butyrate, and lactate [7][8][9]. A great proportion (80-85%) of these SCFA is absorbed by the mucosa of the colon and the other part is either evacuated in the feces or is used for growth and multiplication of bacteria. These indigestible dextrins can, as dietary fibres, have an action on fat and carbohydrate metabolism [7,10], on transit time [11], on mineral bioavailability [12], and on the densities of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tract [13]. Among the soluble fibres, some have already been largely studied, like fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), oligofructoses, and xylooligosaccharides (XOS) [13][14][15][16][17][18]. The major disadvantage of these oligosaccharides is that as other indigestible carbohydrates, they induce digestible complaints often \"incompatible\" with their low energy substituent doses. There is a need to develop new dietary fibres that can be well tolerated at high doses. This is the case of the branched NUTRIOSE \u00ae dextrin, which is well-tolerated up to 45 grams per day [19,20]. Contrary to other dextrins, it is rich in \u03b11-6, \u03b11-2, and \u03b11-3 linkages. Therefore, this dextrin is partly hydrolyzed and absorbed in the small intestine (15%). Large amounts of the ingested product reach the colon and are fermented by the gut microflora (75%).",

The dextrin obtained is purified with activated carbon and demineralised by exchange resins. Afterwards, the product is subjected to chromatographic partitioning that removes glucose and lower molecular weight oligosaccharides. As described in Table 2, the final product, NUTRIOSE \u00ae , is a mixture of glucose polymers with a fairly narrow range of molecular weight (number average Mol. Wt., Mw = 2,600 g/Mol; weight average Mol. Wt., Mw = 5,000 g/Mol). The degree of polymerization is 12-25. In comparison, starch may contain up to a million glucose units. During the heating step, hydrolysis and repolymerization occur. In addition to the typical starch \u03b1-1,4 and \u03b1-1,6 glucosidic linkages, the recombination can result in other specific glucosidic linkages that are not found in starch. Mass spectrometry is used following methylation of NUTRIOSE \u00ae to determine the bond distribution, which can include both linear and branched linkages: (\u03b1-1,6 and / or \u03b2-1,6), (\u03b1-1,2 and / or \u03b2-1,2), (\u03b1-1,3 and / or \u03b2 -1,2), and \u03b2-1,4.

The pH value was measured using a CG-825 Schott pH-meter, equipped with a microelectrode. Immediately there after, the caecum contents were mixed with a preservative solution (2.5 ml per g caecum content) consisting of phosphoric acid (0.63% v/v) and mercury chloride (0.091% w/v). One gram of cecal content was adjusted to 25 mL and centrifuged at 25,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min. The supernatants were colorimetrically analyzed for acetate and lactate (Roche, Meylan, France), and for propionate and butyrate via gas chromatography using a VARIAN 3400 gas chromatograph and a capillary column for free fatty acids (DBFFAP, J&W Scientific FOLSOM, CA; 30 m \u00d7 0.32 mm i.d. film thickness: 0.25 micron).

FOS and inulin exhibit laxative effects at relatively small dosages in animals and in human [11,21]. In our study, animals in group G10 consumed up to 10 g/kg animal/day of dextrin and only soft feces was observed. At this level, as for the other groups, no sign of diarrhea was observed. NUTRIOSE \u00ae at all tested doses did not modify the appearance of the feces compared to the control group, suggesting no effects on peristalsis and secretion in the colon. There was no difference in body weight evolution. At the beginning of the experiment, the animals ranged from 149 g (G10) to 152 g (G0) and 14 days later from 231 g (G2.5) to 240 g (G5). No significant differences were noted between the groups. Thus, this dextrin did not increase dietary intake. Several studies have demonstrated that low digestible carbohydrates were fermented by bacteria and fecal recovery was found to be zero [1]. Such is the case for fructo-oligosaccharides. In contrast, for our study, fecal recovery was about 20% of the ingested dose, demonstrating the incomplete digestion of this dextrin in rats and resulting in a low caloric value. After 2 weeks of NUTRIOSE \u00ae consumption, no physiopathologic damage was observed, whatever the dose as compared to the control group. Thus, the tolerance of the product was excellent. Similar levels of excretion were found in humans fed this dextrin [22]. Taken together, the results indicate that the product was well tolerated, and more particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. These results are in good accordance with the digestive tolerance and fecal excretion of this dextrin in humans [20,22,23].",

            "text": "In our study, the dextrin tested is a very good substrate for cecal fermentation. The highly fermentable product leads to an increase in cecal weight due to the production of bacterial mass in the caecum [13]. The minimum dose to induce cecal enlargement seems to be between 2.5% and 5%. Effectively, there was a high increase in absolute cecal weight (more than 35%) in the 5% treated animals, whereas the increase observed in the 2.5% group (3%) was not statistically significant. The increase of cecal wall may be attributed to an increase in intestinal mucosa thickness as a consequence of the large amount of SCFA produced and as an adaptive process to highly fermentable carbohydrates. Indeed, SCFA production induces the proliferation of cecal cells. It was demonstrated that FOS and XOS increased cecal weight and cecal wall weight compared to a diet without fibres [13]. All the three major short chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) were increased by NUTRIOSE \u00ae . Based on the data, it also appears that the minimal dose to induce a positive effect is between 2.5 and 5%. High levels of SCFA, particularly of butyrate, in the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract are important for a healthy large intestine. Butyrate, known to be the preferred energy substrate for colonocytes, was increased to a large extent in this study and may be correlated with cecal wall augmentation. Indeed, in addition to the trophic effect of butyrate on the mucosa, it is an important source of energy for the colonic epithelium and can regulate both the growth and the differentiation of colonic cells. The fact that at the 2.5% dose there was a statistically significant increase in propionate production suggests that this dextrin is a high propiogenic oligosaccharide. The effect of a diet containing propionate was found to be associated with lower fasting glycemia in rats [10]. An in vitro study on rat hepatocytes showed that propionate can decrease gluconeogenesis, while on the other hand stimulate glycolysis [7]. Another study in humans [24] showed that the addition of propionate to bread inhibited the activity of amylase. Thus, in the present study, the observed increase of propionate production allows one to expect an affect of this low digestible carbohydrate on glycemia. The acetate increase observed in this type of experiment is often related to fermentable carbohydrates [13,[25][26][27]. Lactic acid accumulation was not noted during the study. This would indicate that the process of fermentation was not overdosed even at the highest dose of 10%.",

As a result of fermentation, pH decreases. This phenomenon was indicated as a statistical decrease in the 5% treated group in the second experiment and in the 10% treated group in the first experiment. An acidic cecal pH is probably caused by greater levels of total SCFA production, but it can also be caused by a decrease of nitrogen compounds, which are quite basic [20]. This increased acid production can prevent the colonization of potentially pathogenic microorganisms [28]. This phenomenon can also be associated with the proliferation of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the GI tract. Indeed, the lowering of pH and the production of metabolites stimulate the growth of prebiotic bacteria and the promotion of bacteriostatic effects against potentially harmful bacteria like enterobacteria and clostridia [3]. Vermorel et al. [29] showed that NUTRIOSE \u00ae can improve magnesium and calcium absorption, and their retention, in humans. The authors indicated that this phenomenon could be linked to the decrease of pH of gut content as encountered in our study. Prebiotics are not only nutrients for bacteria, but can also induce environmental changes such as changes in luminal pH, mineral absorption [30], trophicity, and improvement of the immune system [31].",
