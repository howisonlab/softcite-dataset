            "text": "The goal of this research is to determine the dimensions of beliefs about internet advertising affecting Syrian consumers' attitudes and behaviors towards internet advertising. The results indicate that Attitudes are influenced positively by information, and entertainment; and negatively by irritation and values' corruption. Irritation positively influences consumers' behaviors of leaving websites showing the ads. Entertainment positively influences consumers' behaviors of clicking on internet ads for further information concerning advertised products. Attitude is found to fully mediate the relationships between beliefs of information, irritation, and values' corruption and the behaviors clicking on internet ads, and partially mediate the relationship between enter tainment and the behaviors of clicking on internet ads. Attitudes fully mediate the relationships between beliefs of information, entertainment, and values' corruption and the behaviors of leaving websites showing the ads, and partially mediate the relation ship between irritation and the behaviors of leaving websites showing the ads. This research comes to be one of the first studies to investigate Syrian consumers' beliefs about, attitudes, and behavioral responses towards internet advertising. As well as, this study provides evidence of the direct relationship between some of the beliefs about internet advertising (i.e. entertainment and irritation) and the behavioral responses towards it."

            "text": "Advertising is a standard promotional tactic that is desi gned to reach a target audience and to either affect beha vior or to introduce, persuade, and/or remind consumers of an offer (Nihel 2013). Advertising messages could be delivered through various mediums (e.g. TV, radio, and magazines). Some scholars characterize advertising as ubiquitous and an important part of the fabric of modern life (Shavitt et al. 1998). Advertising has advanced with technological innovation, now common throughout the world. Several new advertising mediums are emerging and these have paved the way for advertisers to increase their interactivity with target consumers. Berthon et al. (1996) were the first researchers to investigate how advertising might operate on the internet and they characterized it as a new medium in the marketing communication mix. Other researchers differentiated between offline and on line advertising, suggesting that traditional media (print, TV, and radio) is based on messages that are connected to entertainment, whereas the internet is better viewed as an informationbased medium Lei (2000). Further deba te over how to characterize the internet followed. Wolin et al. (2002: 88) reason that the internet also possesses an entertaining component. They see internet advertising as a broad format that consists of \"commercial content paid for by sponsors, designed for audiences, delivered by video, print, audio, graphics or animation\". Recently, the internet has been regarded as the most powerful advertising media (Radb\u00e2\u021b\u0103, Kubenka 2012).",

The escalation of internet advertising has grown rapidly in Syria, and is exhibited in a wide variety of forms (e.g. websites, banner ads, rich media ads, web logs, electronic mail ads, and onli ne social network advertising). While some researchers have addressed the internet as a very effective adverti sing medium pabedinskaite, Rojut\u0117Gauk\u0161tien\u0117 (2004), Wolin et al. (2002) refered to the internet as a source of challenges and opportunities for advertisers, and that in cludes the need for investigating internet users' beliefs, attitudes, and even their behavioral responses towards this type of advertising espcially when it comes to the results of previous research which considered consumer attitu des towards advertising as an indication of advertising effectiveness (e.g. Russell et al. 1994;Ducoffe 1996;Mehta 2000;Wolin et al. 2002;Wolin, Korgaonkar 2005;Karson et al. 2006;Wang, Sun 2010a, 2010bSun, Wang 2010;Mahmoud 2012aMahmoud , 2012b. Effective internet advertising could promote for purchase intentions towards advertised products (Sathish et al. 2011). Therefore, modelling the relationships among beliefs about, attitudes and behaviors towards internet advertising, through the results of the current study, could help advertisers produce conveniently advertising messages that reach audience more effective ly in the Syrian context. Yet while research and practice have identified the promise of internet advertising, little is known about the impact of internet advertising in the Syrian context as the literature has largely focused on deve loped nations (Sun, Wang 2010;Wang, Sun 2010a, 2010bKamal, Chu 2012). See Mahmoud (2012aMahmoud ( , 2012b for pre liminary research into research focusing on developing countries such as Syria. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to validate scales measuring beliefs and attitudes towards internet advertising with respect to the Syrian cul tural context and test a model (see Fig. 1) linking beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors related to internet advertising. This model is proposed on the basis of previous research and will utilize structural equation modeling.",

Mahmoud (2012a: 92) defined beliefs about internet advertising as all knowledge that one could perceive as correct for in ternet advertising. So consumers could perceive internet advertising as good source of product information (Ju pak 1999). Likewise, consumers may be entertained by internet advertising as it may involve tactics such as inte ractivity and multimedia (Watson et al. 1998). Conversely, internet offers may be a source of irritation as advertising may cause feelings of confusion if information is perceived as intense (Ducoffe 1996). Some users of the internet may install ad blockers, which are software that prevent internet ads from downloading on the browsed website (McCormally 2000). As well as, internet advertising could be perceived as promoting lifestyles embodied by types of products and brands advertised online (pollay, Mittal 1993;Mahmoud 2012b). Internet advertising could be a symbol of materialism as it encourages people to achieve satisfaction through consumption (pollay, Mittal 1993). Falsity refers to the belief about advertising as a source of false information and deceptive claims (Nadilo 1998). Wolin et al. (2002) argue that internet advertising has the ability to shape internet users' values; therefore, it could be a cause of values corruption.",

In this regard, some attitude theorists (e.g. Fazio 1989) propose that attitudes be thought of as objecteva luation associations. That is, an attitude can be viewed as a simple twonode semantic network, with one node representing the object, the second node the global eva luation of the object, and the link between the two nodes the strength of the association (Fabrigar et al. 2005: 80). Lutz (1985: 53) defines attitudes towards advertising, in general, as a learned predisposition to respond in a con sistently favorable or unfavorable manner to advertising. In the context of the internet, Mahmoud (2012a: 92) re fers to attitudes towards internet advertising as a general predisposition to like or dislike advertising messages de livered online.",

Some dimensions of beliefs about in ternet advertising like information (Shavitt et al. 1998;Zhou, Bao 2002;Usman et al. 2010;Eze, Lee 2012;Zabadi et al. 2012;Mahmoud 2012b;Mir 2012;Saxena, Khanna 2013), entertainment (Shavitt et al. 1998;Zhou, Bao 2002;Eze, Lee 2012;Mahmoud 2012b;Saxena, Khanna 2013), and irritation (Zabadi et al. 2012;Mahmoud 2012b;Saxena, Khanna 2013) are found to be more predictive for attitudes towards internet advertising than other di mensions of beliefs.",

In other words, positive attitudes towards inter net advertising will probably be accompanied with favo rable behavioral responses towards internet advertising (e.g. clicking on banners for more details about products advertised). Likewise, negative attitudes will lead to unfa vorable responses towards internet advertising (e.g. leaving websites showing ads). For an instant, Mehta (2000) found that consumers with favorable affection towards adverti sing are more likely to recall brand advertised. Wolin et al. (2002) concluded that the more positive attitudes towards advertising were, the greater the likelihood would be to produce favorable behavioral responses to internet ads. Wang, Sun (2010a; 2010b) proved, through a crosscultural investigation, that positive behaviors regarding clicking on internet ads are significantly associated with favorable attitudes towards advertising. Inspecting people attitudes and behaviors towards social media advertising in a Middle Eastern country, Kamal, Chu (2012b) found that behaviors towards social media advertising are significantly predicted by attitudes.",

Then we ask academicians from the department of Marketing & International Trade in the Higher Institute of Business Administration (HIBA), and the department of Business Administration in Damascus University in Damascus   to evaluate the Arabic wording for our scales' items to guarantee that our measures are facevalidated. As recommended by many researchers (e.g. Tharenou et al. 2007), our questionnaire is piloted before distributed. The pilot study involves 57 internet users. The purpose of this procedure is to guarantee a good understanding and acceptance by respondents, so some questions may need deleting or modifying. Second, measures are fac toranalyzed using the approach of principal Component Analysis and Varimax rotation (see Table 2) to check for the dimensionality of the scales measuring beliefs and attitudes. Third, measures are assessed for reliability using Cronbach alpha to check for their internal consistency (see Table 3). ",

We use the following statistics in testing the goodness of fit: Chi square (c\u00b2) (Bollen 1989); normed fit index (NFI) (Bentler, Bonett 1980); comparative fit index (CFI) (Bentler 1990); root mean square residual (RMR) (Hu, Bentler 1995); and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) (Browne, Cudeck 1993). Those statistics will help to test for how good the model is in fit ting the collected data. Table 5 shows the results of the proposed model test ing. The values of RMR (0.036 < 0.05) (Hu, Bentler 1995), CFI (0.958 > 0.9) (Bentler 1990), and NFI (0.942 > 0.9) (Bentler, Bonett 1980) indicate a good fit for the proposed model. However, RMSEA (0.88 > 0.08) demonstrates a poor fit of the proposed model for our data (J\u00f6reskog, S\u00f6rbom 1989) -besides there are three insignificant paths: Social Role \u2192 Attitude (pvalue = 0.281 > 0.05), Materialism \u2192 Attitude (pvalue = 0.218 > 0.05), and Falsity \u2192 Attitude (pvalue = 0.176 > 0.05). Therefore, our model needs to be revised, and then retested. AMOS suggests adding two new paths (Entertainment \u2192 Click on ad; Irritation \u2192 Leave website) as modification indices to improve the model fit ting for the data. Therefore, we eliminate the insignificant paths, draw the new suggested two paths, and retest the alternative mo del. Table 6 shows the results of testing the alternative model. All paths are significant. The goodness of fit statistics show that the alternative model is presenting a good fit for our data. In this regard, we notice that c\u00b2 value is insignificant (c\u00b2/ df = 1.076, pvalue > 5%), the normed fit index is higher than 0.9 (NFI = 0.982), the comparative fit index is higher than 90% (CFI = 0.999), the root mean square residual is less than 0.05 (RMR = 0.032), and the root mean square error of approximation is less than 0.08 (RMSEA = 0.020) (J\u00f6reskog, S\u00f6rbom 1989;Hu, Bentler 1995;Bentler 1992;MacCallum et al. 1996). Consequently, we conclude that the alternative model expresses a good fit ting for our data. As well as, Table 8 shows that all indirect effects are significant. That is, we come to a decision that H1 and H2 are partially supported in the light of the following results (see Fig. 2).",

That could be through working towards having internet advertising more infor mative (e.g. providing timely productrelated information), more entertaining (e.g. including flash games within in ternet ads, or enclosing amusing pictures), less irritating and confusing (e.g. avoiding high volumes of ads within a website), and less values corruptive or provalues through enhancing targeting tools in a way preventing kids from being exposed to inappropriate ads (e.g. Most social networ ks ads are accurately communicated to targeted segments of consumers).
