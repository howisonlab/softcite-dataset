We aimed to develop a novel animal model that would be suitable for the study of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. Materials and Methods: Atherosclerotic plaque was induced in 24 iliac arteries from 12 rabbits by combining a high cholesterol diet, endothelial denudation, and injection into the vessel wall with either saline (n=5), olive oil (n=6), or inflammatory proteins [n=13, high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) n=8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 n=5] using a Cricket TM Micro-infusion catheter. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed to detect plaque characteristics after 4 weeks, and all tissues were harvested for histological evaluation. Results: Advanced plaque was more frequently observed in the group injected with inflammatory proteins. Macrophage infiltration was present to a higher degree in the HMGB1 and TNF-\u03b1 groups, compared to the oil or saline group (82.1\u00b15.1% and 94.6\u00b1 2.2% compared to 49.6\u00b114.0% and 46.5\u00b19.6%, p-value<0.001), using RAM11 antibody staining. On OCT, lipid rich plaques were more frequently detected in the inflammatory protein group [saline group: 2/5 (40%), oil group: 3/5 (50%), HMGB1 group: 6/8 (75%), and TNF-\u03b1 group: 5/5 (100%)]. Conclusion: These data indicate that this rabbit model of atherosclerotic lesion formation via direct injection of pro-inflammatory proteins into the vessel wall is useful for in vivo studies investigating atherosclerosis.",

            "text": "dothelium with thick fibroatheroma. 2,4 The formation of vulnerable plaques and the development of sudden thrombus have been observed in postmortem humans with cardiovascular disease. 3 Due to the lack of adequate animal models, pre-thrombotic pathophysiology and plaque vulnerability have been difficult to investigate in vivo. Several large animal models of vulnerable atherosclerosis and plaque rupture have been proposed. [5][6][7][8] Using a high cholesterol diet and balloon injury, followed by pharmacological triggering, a rabbit model of induced atherosclerotic plaque and atherothrombosis has been developed. 6,8 However, these models show difficulties in developing consistent advanced atherosclerotic plaques, thereby limiting their usefulness to clinical researchers. To overcome these limitations, a reproducible porcine model of atherosclerosis, which utilized the direct injection of complex lipids into the vascular wall, 9 was developed. Additionally, this approach resulted in focal lesions that were located in positively remodeled vessels that have increased neovascularization, as well as the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines. 10 Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory and immune response disease, and plaque vulnerability is linked with increased levels of inflammation. 11 As such, the direct injection of pro-inflammatory proteins into the vessel wall may trigger a more potent inflammatory response and consistently augment the atherosclerotic process within a short period of time. To date, no study has investigated the effects of injecting pro-inflammatory proteins directly into the vascular wall on inflammation and atherosclerosis. In this study, we selected the pro-inflammatory proteins high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, because both of these chemokines are well known to promote the inflammatory process and mediate atherosclerosis. This study was designed to investigate the effect of injecting pro-inflammatory proteins into the vessel wall on the development of advanced plaques and inflammation.",

Further- Fig. 4. The relative mRNA levels in induced atherosclerosis of rabbit iliac artery. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of RAGE, HMGB1, and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression in iliac arteries from four groups of rabbits A. Representative data showing the mRNA expressions of RAGE, HMGB1, and TNF-\u03b1 in iliac arteries from four groups of rabbits (normalized with GAPDH as the house keeping gene) B, C, and D. The data in the bar graph are quantified ratios of the signal for RAGE, HMGB1, and TNF-\u03b1 to that for GAPDH set at fold increase.

In this study, in order to overcome this variability of developed atheromatous plaque, we modified the existing protocols in animal models. Previously, Granada, et al. 9 proposed a method for inducing atherosclerotic plaques by combining balloon injury and the vascular wall injection of lipidic substances in a swine model. In their study, atherosclerotic lesions containing inflammatory cells, positive remodeling, and neovascularization all developed and resembled the early stages of human atherosclerosis. 5 Furthermore, the intramural injection of complex lipids into the coronary arteries induced an increased expression of vascular endothelial grow factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). 10 However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the induction of an atherosclerotic plaque in a rabbit model by the direct injection of a lipidic substance or pro-inflammatory proteins into the vessel wall. We observed the de-veloped plaque area to be similar among the groups injected with either saline, lipid, or lipid+pro-inflammatory protein. However, macrophage accumulation was more prominent in the pro-inflammatory injected groups. Furthermore, the proinflammatory groups had an increased expression of TNF-\u03b1 and HMGB1 within the intima and media of the vessel, compared with either the saline or oil injected groups. This finding suggests that direct tissue injection of pro-inflammatory proteins may induce potent inflammation and promote the development of an advanced atheromatous plaque.",

            "text": "We applied two pro-inflammatory proteins in this study, TNF-\u03b1 and HMGB1. TNF-\u03b1 is a well-known potent pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis. It promotes the inflammatory response, which causes many of the clinical problems associated with autoimmune disorders, such as inflammatory disease. 11,15 HMGB1 is a potent proinflammatory protein ligand that mediates inflammation by activating innate immunity receptors, such as toll-like receptor (TLR) and RAGE. 16 HMGB1 passively diffuses out of necrotic or apoptotic cells. It works as a pro-inflammatory mediator Fig. 5. The relative protein levels in induced atherosclerosis of rabbit iliac artery. Western blot analysis of RAGE, HMGB1 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expressions in iliac artery from four groups of rabbits A. Representative data showing the protein expressions of RAGE, HMGB1 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in iliac arteries from four groups of rabbits (normalized with GAPDH as the house keeping gene) B, C, and D. The data in the bar graph are quantified ratios of the signal for RAGE, HMGB1, and TNF-\u03b1 to that for GAPDH set at fold increase. Data were presented as the mean\u00b1SEM. *p<0.05, compared with the Saline group, \u2020 p<0.05, compared with the Oil group, \u2021 p<0.05, compared with the TNF-\u03b1 group.

These data suggest that the HMBG1 injection may induce an upregulation of RAGE expression and activation, resulting in an increased recruitment of macrophages through the expression of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. 16 OCT is a well-established, accurate imaging modality with a high resolution, capable of evaluating the characteristics of atheromatous plaques in clinical situations. 13,16,19 Here, using OCT, we were able to show that HMGB1 and TNF-\u03b1 groups had a higher incidence of lipid rich plaques, compared to both the oil or saline groups. This finding confirmed histological studies that showed HMGB1 and TNF-\u03b1 groups have more ad-vanced plaques, compared to the saline and oil groups. OCT indicated that the diameter and area of the stenosis were not different between the four groups.",

Furthermore, plaque rupture or thrombus, which is the main pathogenic mechanism of acute coronary syndrome, was not observed in this experimental model. However, these limitations do not detract from the central merit of this work, which shows that a consistent model of advanced atherosclerosis has been developed. Therefore, our study seems as a cost-effective and short-time method that induces atherosclerotic lesions in rabbit. The lack of adequate medium to large sized animal models for atherosclerosis has been a major limitation for animal research in the cardiovascular field. We believe this model may be useful for further study investigating the pathogenesis and treatment of atherosclerosis. Also, it could be useful E 100 50 0 V IV III II I",
