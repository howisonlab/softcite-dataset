            "text": "Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a major mode of extracellular calcium entry, plays roles in a variety of cell activities. Accumulating evidence indicates that the intracellular calcium ion concentration and calcium signaling are critical for the responses induced by oxidative stress. The present study was designed to investigate the potential effect of SOCE inhibition on H2O2-induced apoptosis in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are the predominant cells involved in endothelial repair. The results showed that H2O2-induced EPC apoptosis was reversed by SOCE inhibition induced either using the SOCE antagonist ML-9 or via silencing of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a component of SOCE. Furthermore, SOCE inhibition repressed the increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ameliorated the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2O2. Our findings provide evidence that SOCE inhibition exerts a protective effect on EPCs in response to oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy against vascular endothelial injury."

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are mobilized from bone marrow to the vascular endothelium, are vital for endothelial repair, functioning directly through differentiation and indirectly through paracrine effects. Oxidative stress caused by free radicals, oxygen anions and peroxides is closely associated with the initiation, development and progression of vascular diseases (Heitzer et al., 2001;Yoshii et al., 2006;Schleicher and Friess, 2007;Cachofeiro et al., 2008;Battelli et al., 2014) and has direct cytotoxic effects on the endothelium (Griendling and FitzGerald, 2003;Harrison et al., 2003) and EPCs (Hung et al., 2003;Urbich et al., 2005;Thum et al., 2006;Thum et al., 2007;Watson et al., 2008). However, the specific mechanism of these effects is not clear, and the roles of calcium and calcium signaling in this mechanism are undefined.",

Store-operated calcium channels (SOCs; also known as SOCCs) mediate store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and are expressed ubiquitously in non-excitable cells, such as EPCs (Lewis, 2007). Previous studies have demonstrated that SOCE in embryonic fibroblasts is critical for the oxidative stress response (Henke et al., 2012). Numerous studies have suggested that oxidative stress enhances the inward flow of calcium, leading to intracellular calcium overload (Caron et al., 2007) and ultimately, cell apoptosis (Henke et al., 2013). Therefore, we hypothesized that SOCE may play a significant role in oxidative stressinduced apoptosis in EPCs. Inhibition of SOCE may protect EPCs from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, thus making SOCE a potential target for the treatment of various vascular diseases.",

As shown in Fig. 1A, H2O2 induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. When the H2O2 concentration was increased to 600 \u03bcM, cell viability was approximately 50%. This concentration was used in the following experiments. H2O2-induced apoptosis was detected via flow cytometry. To assess whether intracellular calcium was involved in the H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis of EPCs, we pretreated EPCs with BAPTA-AM (BA), an intracellular free calcium chelator (Fig. 1B-1D). The addition of BA (10 \u03bcM) attenuated the H2O2-induced injury of EPCs, suggesting that H2O2-induced injury may be related to disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis.",

Thus, we performed calcium imaging to determine whether H2O2 affects calcium signaling in EPCs through SOCE. H2O2 stimulation of EPCs in a calciumfree buffer led to an increase in cytosolic calcium due to calcium release from the ER (left peaks in Fig. 3B, 3C). The addition of calcium after cytosolic calcium level slowed down resulted in calcium influx through the PM (right peaks in Fig. 3B, 3C) due to the depletion of ER stores. These results were considered typical calcium imaging results for SOCE and were similar to thapsigargin (TG; 2 \u03bcM)-induced calcium fluxes (Fig. 3A). Therefore, H2O2-induced calcium changes potentially occur mainly through SOCE. Furthermore, the inhibition of SOCE resulted in a significant decrease in cytosolic calcium in response to H2O2 insult (Fig. 3B, 3C).",

            "text": "It is generally recognized that H2O2 insult leads to calcium influx and disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis, followed by an increase in ROS production (Ohyama et al., 2012). These changes further activate downstream apoptotic signaling pathways and ultimately result in cell death. Accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative stress-induced injuries might be attenuated by stabilizing intracellular calcium homeostasis (Godfraind, 2005;Ohyama et al., 2012). Moreover, some studies have indicated that antioxidants diminish increases in intracellular calcium levels (Pieper and Dondlinger, 1998;Su et al., 1999). Although the specific mechanism of the reduction of intracellular calcium following antioxidant application is still not clear, we hypothesized that the decrease in intracellular ROS production in response to antioxidant insult might lead to a change in the intracellular calcium level. In the present study, we demonstrated that H2O2 insult resulted in calcium influx and increase in intracellular ROS levels. In addition, we found that SOCE inhibition prevented intracellular ROS accumulation. To date, there have been no reports of the effect of antioxidants on calcium regulation in EPCs. Thus we will pay more attention to this aspect in our future study. SOCE, which occurs ubiquitously in non-excitable cells, plays an essential role in the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that SOCE is involved in oxidative stress (T\u00f6rnquist et al., 2000;Mart\u00edn-Romero et al., 2008;Henke et al., 2013;Plomaritas et al., 2014). However, the effect of SOCE on oxidative stress remains to be elucidated. Several studies have demonstrated that H2O2 insult weakens SOCE (T\u00f6rnquist et al., 2000;Plomaritas et al., 2014). Other studies have shown that H2O2 insult augments SOCE and the influx of calcium ions (Rao et al., 2013). These contradictory results may be explained by the activation of different signaling pathways in response to oxidative stress in different cell types. For example, the oxidative stress-induced changes in calcium influx and SOCE are mediated by the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in thyroid FRTL-5 cells (T\u00f6rnquist et al., 2000) and by regulation of STIM1 expression in the HT22 cells (Rao et al., 2013). In the present study, the H2O2 insult-induced disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis was attenuated by inhibiting SOCE using ML-9 or via STIM1 silencing. These findings suggest that SOCE plays a critical role in oxidative stress.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence supports the notion that calcium and calcium signaling are involved in ER and mitochondrial activities (Arnaudeau et al., 2001;Pizzo and Pozzan, 2007). The ER, a site of major calcium stores, plays a critical role in a variety of cellular activities, such as protein synthesis, posttranslational modifications, protein folding and apoptosis. A prolonged decrease in the ER calcium level (Hooper et al., 2013) or accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins within the ER (Hammadi et al., 2013) leads to ER stress. Prolonged ER stress further promotes the expression of CHOP, a CEBP family transcription factor, and caspase 12, thereby activating downstream apoptotic pathways. Moreover, ER stress can result in sustained mitochondrial calcium accumulation (Deniaud et al., 2008). The mitochondria, which are also important calcium-buffering organelles, are physically and functionally interconnected with the ER. Mitochondria are often located near calcium release sites in the ER or at calcium influx channels at the PM, where they buffer intracellular calcium changes by modulating the rate of capacitative calcium entry through calcium release-activated channels (CRACs) or the rate of calcium release by IP3 receptors (Arnaudeau et al., 2001). Disruption of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis may result in dysfunction of the mitochondria, resulting in up-regulation of caspase 9 expression and enhanced release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c and caspase 9 form apoptotic bodies through the multiple polymerization of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), thereby activating downstream apoptotic pathways (Hikita et al., 2015). Several published reports have suggested that various apoptotic pathways are involved in the cross-talk between the ER and mitochondria (Wang and El-Deiry, 2004;Pizzo and Pozzan, 2007). Cytochrome c, which plays a vital role in this cross-talk, translocates to the ER to bind inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors, leading to sustained calcium release. This calcium release in turn triggers the release of cytochrome c. Importantly, cytochrome c is involved in these apoptotic pathways. The present study demonstrated that SOCE inhibition restored intracellular calcium homeostasis and suppressed the pro-apoptotic effect by reducing ER stress and preserving mitochondrial function. Taken together, these data show that communication between the ER and mitochondria is involved in the protective effect of SOCE inhibition against H2O2 insult.",
