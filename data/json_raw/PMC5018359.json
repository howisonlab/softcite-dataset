Although many previous studies have evaluated the potential risk factors of NAFLD, few studies have determined the effect of residency or marriage status on NAFLD. Objectives: We aim to evaluate whether residency and marriage status increased the risk factors for NAFLD. Materials and Methods: We utilized data from 5,052 participants, 18 years and older, from a cohort study conducted using 6,140 participants in northern Iran. The population was divided into 16 subgroups according to sex and age; the age groups had an interval of 10 years. We randomly selected the subjects from each subgroup in proportion to the size of each subpopulation group. Logistic regression analyses were conducted on NAFLD as an outcome of marriage status, residency (rural vs. urban), and other potential risk factors. Results: We found that NAFLD had an inverse association with rural living in men (OR = 0.513, 0.422-0.622, P value < 0.001) and women (OR = 0.431, 0.345-0.539, P value < 0.001). Furthermore, we determined that NAFLD had a direct association with marriage status for men (OR = 2.770, 2.004-3.831, P value < 0.001) and women (OR = 1.241, 1.033-1.490, P value = 0.0209). Conclusions: While rural living has a protective effect on NAFLD, marriage may be a potential risk factor for this condition."

            "text": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the leading cause of liver disease worldwide (1). NAFLD is comprised of a wide spectrum of liver pathologies, from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD can lead to liver cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (2). The prevalence of this condition has been estimated to be 20% -30% in western countries, and there is an increasing trend in low-and middle-income countries (1,3). The increasing prevalence of NAFLD is attributable to the increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and other metabolic conditions (4,5). Studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of NAFLD. Based on these studies, an association was established between NAFLD and age, obesity, blood pressure (BP), dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance (6, 7). However, to the knowledge of the authors, only a few studies have evaluated the effect of residency and marriage status on NAFLD.",

WC was determined at the midpoint of the distance between the lowest costal ridge and the upper border of the iliac crest. The largest circumference between the waist and knee was measured for the HC. Following at least 5 min of rest, the BP was measured using a fitted cuff while the participant was in a sitting position.

The potential predictors that were used in the analyses were: age, marriage (married vs. unmarried), residency (rural vs. urban), smoking (smoking vs. non-smoking), obesity (obese vs. non-obese), blood pressure (high BP vs. low), triglyceride (high TG vs. low), and high-density lipoprotein (low HDL vs. high). The obesity, high BP, high TG, and low HDL were defined based on a joint interim statement definition of MetS (10). The Wald test, significant levels, and odd ratios (OR) were reported. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for the logistic regressions. All statistical analyses were conducted using statistical software (SPSS Inc., version 21, Chicago, IL and Stata software, version 12, StataCorp, Texas, US). The significant levels in all analyses were considered to be 0.05. Table 1 shows the basic characteristics of the study population based on residency. While the rural people had a higher WC, SBP, AST, FBS, HDL, and HOMA, the urban people had a higher DBP. Table 2 shows the basic characteristics of the study population based on marriage status. Based on our results, married people had a higher mean age, WC, DBP, GGT, ALT, FBS, and TG, but a lower HDL than unmarried people did. Table 3 shows the results of the univariate and multivariate binary logistic regressions. In these analyses, the NAFLD was considered to be the outcome variable. NAFLD had a direct association with marriage status in men (OR = 2.770 (2.004 -3.831), P value < 0.001) and women (OR = 1.241 (1.033 -1.490), P value = 0.0209), and an inverse association with living in rural areas for men (OR = 0.513 (0.422 -0.622), P value < 0.001) and women (OR = 0.431 (0.345 -0.539), P value < 0.001).",

We showed that the prevalence of NAFLD is significantly lower in people who live in rural areas than in urban areas. One study in China showed that the prevalence of NAFLD was considerably lower in people who lived in rural areas (12.9%) compared with people in urban areas (23%) (11). Urbanization is related to unhealthy lifestyles, which likely played a critical role in the high prevalence of NAFLD in the urban areas. Previous studies showed that the levels of urbanization also played a critical role in the prevalence of NAFLD. Local economic status, social performances, and cultural practices, such as the consumption of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and even living in areas with a healthy environment, can have an effect on healthrelated practices (12). Other studies showed that living in an urban area of Iran is usually associated with a higher prevalence of psychological disorders (13). On the other hand, psychological disorders have a significant association with NAFLD, although this association may be partly due to the consumption of anti-psychological medications by psychiatric patients (14). Some studies have pointed out the role that vitamin D deficiency has on NAFLD (14).",

Some authors suggested that the beneficial effects that marriage has on health have been diluted because of industrialization and modernization (20,21). On the other hand, an overestimation of health by married people might help explain the previously reported positive effect that marriage has on health (19). Overall, industrialization, urbanization, and modernization have negative effects on marital quality, family functioning, and spouse support, which can explain the diminishing protection that marriage has on health (19,20). In developing countries, married people, particularly married men, who have financial problems and household expenses have less interests in engaging in healthy behaviors, including appropriate nutrition, regular exercise, and timely visits to physicians and other healthcare providers. Many married men may have two or even three jobs to earn their livelihood. They generally do not have enough time to exercise or perform other pleasurable activities. They may not eat an appropriate breakfast or eat other meals at an appropriate time.",

Our results contrast with previous studies about the positive role that marriage plays in health. Although, the risk factors of NAFLD have been evaluated in previous studies, few studies have assessed the association between residency and marriage status with NAFLD.

However, we did evaluate the associations in a large "
