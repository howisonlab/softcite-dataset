            "text": "Insects exhibit an elaborate repertoire of behaviors in response to environmental stimuli. The central complex plays a key role in combining various modalities of sensory information with an insect's internal state and past experience to select appropriate responses. Progress has been made in understanding the broad spectrum of outputs from the central complex neuropils and circuits involved in numerous behaviors. Many resident neurons have also been identified. However, the specific roles of these intricate structures and the functional connections between them remain largely obscure. Significant gains rely on obtaining a comprehensive catalog of the neurons and associated GAL4 lines that arborize within these brain regions, and on mapping neuronal pathways connecting these structures. To this end, small populations of neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster central complex were stochastically labeled using the multi-color flip-out technique and a catalog was created of the neurons, their morphologies, trajectories, relative arrangements, and corresponding GAL4 lines. This report focuses on one structure of the central complex, the protocerebral bridge, and identifies just 17 morphologically distinct cell types that arborize in this structure. This work also provides new insights into the anatomical structure of the four components of the central complex and its accessory neuropils. Most strikingly, we found that the protocerebral bridge contains 18 glomeruli, not 16, as previously believed. Revised wiring diagrams that take into account this updated architectural design are presented. This updated map of the Drosophila central complex will facilitate a deeper behavioral and physiological dissection of this sophisticated set of structures.",

            "text": "The Drosophila central complex comprises a set of four neuropils that straddle the midline of the protocerebrum in the center of the brain. In each of these four neuropils, an intricate collection of neurons is exquisitely assembled and precisely connected to neighboring neuropils to conduct the many complex behaviors of the fly. The central complex serves as an integration center for diverse motor, sensory, learning, and memory activities in insects. It is involved in coordinating locomotor behavior, including flight and various aspects of walking in flies and cockroaches (Bausenwein et al., 1986;Strauss and Heisenberg, 1993;Ilius et al., 1994;Martin et al., 1999;Ridgel et al., 2007;Bender et al., 2010); visual stripe fixation as well as the initiation, organization, and integration of behavior (Bausenwein et al., 1994); visual feature processing (Seelig and Jayaraman, 2013); sensory-guided changes in orien-tation and locomotion in the cockroach (Bender et al., 2010;Guo and Ritzmann, 2013); various types of memory in flies (Liu et al., 2006;Neuser et al., 2008;Pan et al., 2009;Ofstad et al., 2011;Kuntz et al., 2012); angular reach in gap crossing (Triphan et al., 2010); sleep (Donlea et al., 2011;Donlea et al., 2014); sound production during courtship (Popov et al., 2003); gravitaxis (Baker et al., 2007); and in sun-compass navigation in the locust and monarch butterfly (Heinze and Homberg, 2007;Heinze and Reppert, 2011).",

            "text": "The central complex is highly conserved across insect species, and while the degree of functional conservation remains largely unknown, structural conservation is strong, although there are conspicuous differences in the basic blueprint of this brain region. All insects examined to date have a protocerebral bridge (PB), a caudal neuropil that resembles mustache handlebars in shape (Fig. 1). The PB is vertically divided into distinct units called glomeruli (G). The noduli (NO) lie rostral to the PB and constitute the only paired neuropil of the central complex structures (Fig. 1). Depending on the species, anywhere from two to four discrete units precariously stacked on top of one another on each side of the midline constitute the noduli. While the stacked noduli have been referred to as (horizontal) layers, no vertical divisions have been reported for these structures. The anteriormost structure is the central body (CB), which, in some insects, comprises an upper (CBU) and lower (CBL) half. In Diptera, the structures homologous to the CBU and CBL are called the fan-shaped body (FB) and ellipsoid body (EB), respectively ( Fig. 1). The FB is posterior to the EB and is the largest of the central complex neuropils. It is subdivided vertically into columns, known as segments in Drosophila (Hanesch et al., 1989) and staves in Musca (Strausfeld, 1976). Along the anterior-posterior axis of the FB, Hanesch et al. (1989) observed four shells, delineated by the positions and extent to which arbors from smallfield neurons project into these FB domains. The most prominent subdivisions of the FB are the horizontal Figure 1. Central complex. A: The central complex straddles the midline in the central brain (gray). Its four components are the protocerebral bridge (solid purple fill; posterior), fan-shaped body (green), ellipsoid body (orange; anterior); and noduli (solid blue fill). Accessory neuropils that are arborized by PB neurons include the crepine (CRE, transparent blue), rubus (RUB, yellow), gall (GA, red), and lateral accessory lobe (LAL, transparent purple). Posterior (B), sagittal (C; anterior to the right), and dorsal (D) views of the central complex. Images A-D were generated using Fluorender (Wan et al., 2009(Wan et al., , 2012. The four components of the central complex are shown immunolabeled with anti-nc82: (E) PB, (F) FB, (G) EB, and (H) NO. Asterisks in F highlight the layers that can be distinguished by differences in synaptic density, as measured by intensity of nc82 signal. Dorsal is up. Scale bars 5 20 lm in A-D; 10 lm in E-G; 11 lm in H. layers, evident in brains immunolabeled to reveal the density of synapses (Fig. 1F). The ventral half of the EB is the most anterior neuropil of the central complex; the EB is partially embedded in the FB and is tilted on its axis such that the dorsal half is oriented more posteriorly. In Drosophila, the EB is shaped like a torus, whereas in other Diptera, as well as most other insects, its shape more closely resembles that of a kidney bean (Strausfeld, 1976). Similar to the FB, the EB is subdivided on three axes but the EB terminology is inconsistent with that used for equivalent axes in the FB. Divisions along the anterior-posterior axis (shells in the FB) are called rings in the EB (Hanesch et al., 1989). Concentric rings along the radius of the EB are called layers (Young and Armstrong, 2010b), deriving their name from the homologous and more obvious \"layers\" in the noncircular CBL and the more common arched or kidney-bean form of the EB in other, non-Drosophila dipterans. Finally, the vertical divisions analogous to the PB glomeruli are the wedge-shaped divisions along the radius of the toroid that resemble pieces of pie. The analogy to the PB glomeruli is evident if the torus is split at its base and the formerly joined ends stretched away from one another, thereby converting rings into layers. These divisions are called sectors or segments (Hanesch et al., 1989).",

This map will need to 1) provide a detailed description of the architectural framework in which these neurons reside, 2) define inputs and outputs to each of the substructures that integrates sensory input with behavioral output, and 3) illustrate the connections between these brain regions. The work presented here contributes to the generation of this map by refining the architecture of a subset of neuropils of the central brain, including the four components of the central complex and some associated regions, and by illustrating the \"wiring rules\" used by neurons to connect these substructures of the central complex. The neurons described in this work focus almost exclusively on cells that arborize in the PB. We expect that most PB cell types are reported here, although electron microscope (EM) reconstruction will be required to verify complete coverage. At least two cells are known to be excluded from this description: one cell type identified by Lin et al. (2013) that was not seen in this study, and one cell seen only twice in this study, and neither time in its entirety. When necessary, cells that do not arborize in the PB are included in the analysis both to provide a more comprehensive description of the anatomy of central complex structures and to strengthen connectivity and architectural claims suggested by PB neurons.",

These lines were characterized using the multicolor flip-out (MCFO) technique (Nern et al., in prep.), which generates stochastically labeled single cells in a spectrum of colors. This method employs a transcription unit and a transcriptional stop signal. The ability of the transcription unit to produce a product is blocked by a transcriptional stop signal. The stop signal can be removed by the action of a site-specific recombinase, and the fraction of cells in which the stop signal is removed-and thus the density of immunolabeling-can be varied by adjusting the level of recombinase produced (Struhl and Basler, 1993). Briefly, UAS reporter constructs carrying Flag, VK5, and HA epitope tags (pJFRC206-5xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-FLAG in VK00005 and pJFRC200-10xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-HA in attP18, Viswanathan et al., submitted) downstream of an FRT-flanked stop signal were excised by limited expression of FLP recombinase activity. The following Flp stocks were used.",

In particular, nc82 labels the platform of the T-bar ribbon, and not only has nc82 not been shown to label the platforms at CNS synapses, but not all synapses in the CNS have such organelles (Butcher et al., 2012).",

Nomenclature design. A: This generic schematic illustrates the nomenclature system. Three neuropils are shown. Neuropil 1, the first neuropil in a neuron's \"name,\" is the neuropil closest to the cell body. The subdomains (abbreviated sd in the figure) are included in the neuron's name to define the subregion/s of the neuropils in which the cell type arborizes. For example, there are several distinct volumes in the EB, so the volume that is specific to a given cell type is included in the name. The third component of a cell's name is the predominant morphology of its arbors, abbreviated as either \"s\" for spines, or \"b\" for boutons. B,C: Two neurons are shown, accompanied by schematics to illustrate the cells' locations in the central complex, and by the neuron's name, annotated to illustrate how the name is derived. Letters that are used in the neuron names are highlighted in color. Ovals in the schematics represent the cell bodies, solid and hatched fills denote spine and bouton arbor morphologies, respectively. PB: protocerebral bridge; GA: gall; EB: ellipsoid body; cb: cell body; s: spines; b: boutons; FB: fan-shaped body; RUB: rubus. since the connectivity path and the morphological features of arbors at each synaptic junction are unique for each cell type. Such a system also obviates the need for a historical knowledge of neuron nomenclature (for example, a \"P1\" neuron). While some important morphological details are not included in the path, such as size and location of the soma and trajectory of the primary neurite, inclusion of all details would be inordinately cumbersome and unlikely to be essential to distinguish unique cell types. Established nomenclature, as described in Ito et al. (2014), is used when possible and when it was considered accurate and sufficient in light of the new findings described here. Newly identified compartments are named in accordance with preexisting terms, when possible. (For example, two, not one, regions constitute the medial nodulus, or NO 2 , and are referred to here as the dorsal and ventral compartments of NO 2 .) When necessary, \"ipsilateral\" (\"i\") and \"contralateral\" (\"c\") are included in the neuron's name; these designations are context-dependent. For example, in complex arborization patterns these designations provide geographic information about the locations of the arbors. In cases in which the neuron does not arborize in the PB, the cell body serves as the reference point, as follows: If the arbor is on the same side as the cell body, it is considered ipsilateral. Finally, this naming scheme has the added advantage that additional detail can be incorporated as necessary or as it becomes available. For example, during the course of this study it became evident that neurons arborize in only a subset of the glomeruli of the PB, so the designation \"G x-y \" was incorporated to identify the specific glomeruli targeted by the cell type, where \"x\" refers to the number of the medial glomerulus and \"y\" refers to the lateral glomerulus.",

Meinertzhagen, pers. comm.;Takemura et al., 2008). Even with the use of polarity markers, discriminating between input and output can be difficult (Nicolai et al., 2010). Indeed, it will likely turn out to be the case that many of the terminals in the cells described here are mixed. Ultimately, EM-level analysis will be necessary to definitively resolve the fine details of an arbor's morphology and the polarity of the cells' terminals. In the neuronal path nomenclature presented here, bleb-like or bouton terminals are designated \"b\" (for boutons), spiny or branch-like arbors are designated \"s\" (for spiny/ spines), and mixed terminals as \"s.b.\" (Fig. 2).",

This line of logic suggests these cells perform the same function and consequently should be considered to be members of the same cell type. Therefore, a cell's path was used to define its cell type, so each of the 17 PB cell types identified in this study follows a unique projection (Fig. 3, Table 3A). Lin et al. (2013) adopted a more conservative definition in which they define cells that are likely performing the same function for different points in space as different cell types (in other words, the same cell performing the same function in different glomeruli).",

This larger and more spatially refined dataset of the relative positions of uniquely colored cells revealed new insights into the architecture and circuitry of the Drosophila central complex, as well as new cell types.

In addition to the aforementioned neopterans, it is widely accepted that the division of the PB into 16 units is a common theme among other neopterans, including the cockroach Periplaneta americana and the paper wasp Polistes castaniensis (Strausfeld, 1976). The work presented here reveals that there are in fact 18, rather than 16, glomeruli in the PB in Drosophila brains. There are nine glomeruli per hemisphere, abbreviated here as G1. . .G9. The more sophisticated genetic tools, imaging methods, and versatile software programs used for this work enable unambiguous visualization of 18 glomeruli in both adult brains immunolabeled with nc82 (which recognizes the synaptic protein, Bruchpilot) as well as in brains in which the MCFO strategy was used to label random subsets of cells, thereby highlighting each glomerulus in a distinct color from its neighbors (Movies 1 and 2). Eighteen glomeruli have been reliably counted in multiple GAL4 lines that label diverse cell types in the PB. Furthermore, this is not a sex-specific morphological phenomenon, since PBs from both male and female brains contain 18 glomeruli (Fig. 4). The partitioning of the PB into 18 segments is also evident in the pupal brain, as can be seen in figure 6J from Young and Armstrong (2010a). In their figure, the two medial glomeruli, while evident, are not targeted in the enhancer trap line used. Although anatomy does not predict function, the data presented here strongly suggest that G1, the medial glomerulus, and the likely glomerulus to have been overlooked in previous studies, is most certainly a functional unit given that: 1) it is targeted by various cell types (e.g.,",

Confocal images of all neurons with arbors in the PB that were identified in this study are shown. Each image is accompanied by a sketch that illustrates the neuropils in which the neuron arborizes. A: This schematic illustrates all neuropils that are arborized by the PB neurons described here, except the inferior bridge (IB) and superior posterior slope (SPS), which were omitted to simplify the schematic. The IB and SPS are shown in Ito et al., 2014. The schematic illustrates the current understanding of the subvolumes that constitute each of the neuropils shown, which is derived from work presented here. The neuropils were traced from a single focal plane of nc82immunolabeled specimens, so they reflect the approximate shapes of their respective brain regions. The layout and relative sizes of the neuropils were modified to accommodate the two dimensionality of the schematic. The color scheme was chosen to best separate adjacent volumes and is not coordinated with volumes of similar color within this schematic, nor with any neurons or figures in the text. PB: protocerebral bridge. Numbers 1-9 in the PB identify each of the glomeruli of this neuropil. FB: fan-shaped body. Layers 1-9 of the FB are indicated. The relative widths of each layer are accurate for the focal plane shown. The irregular line that demarcates layer 4 from layer 5 is intended to illustrate the gaps in nc82 label in this region. The serrated ventral boundary of layer 1 depicts the seven teeth of this layer, as described below. The gall comprises three regions: the gall tip (GT), dorsal gall (DG), and ventral gall (VG). LAL: lateral accessory lobe. EB: ellipsoid body. CRE: crepine. RUB: rubus. NO 1 : dorsal nodulus. NO 2 D: dorsal subcompartment of medial nodulus. NO 2 V: ventral subcompartment of medial nodulus. NO 3 : ventral nodulus; individual subcompartments of this neuropil are not indicated in the schematic. B-U: Confocal images and sketches of neurons drawn on the template shown in A. Neuropils that are arborized by the neurons are highlighted in black, whereas regions that are not populated by a given neuron are shadowed in gray. In the sketches, spiny arbors are drawn as random scribbles and boutons are illustrated as dots. B: PB G2-9 .s-FB'1.b-NO 3 P.b. C: PB G2-9 .s-FB'1.b-NO 3 M.b. D: PB G2-9 .s-FB'2.b-NO 3 A.b. E: PB G2-9 .s-FB'3.b-NO 2 D.b. To more accurately depict the morphology of the arbor in layer 3 of the FB, it is shown extending into layer 4 in the drawing although in reality, the arbor is confined to layer 3. F: PB G2-9 .s-FB'3.b-NO 2 V.b. The sense of depth conveyed by the maximum intensity projection of the confocal image is not conveyed in the 2-dimensional drawing. Consequently, the morphology of the NO 2 V arbor appears different in the sketch compared to the confocal image. G: PB G2-9 .s-EBt.b-NO 1 .b. and anterior-posterior layers called shells (Hanesch et al., 1989). The PB neurons characterized here fill the entire anterior-posterior depth of the structure, so shells will not be discussed further. The number of layers in the Drosophila FB has most recently been estimated to be \"roughly eight\" (Young and Armstrong, 2010b) or six (Lin et al., 2013). nc82 immunolabeling reveals a low-resolution \"stratigraphic column\" of seven distinct layers in the FB, based on quality, texture, and intensity of the immunoreactivity, which reflect the density of synapses ( Fig. 5A).",

The bouton-rich arbor is clearly confined to the dorsal layer of the FB (Fig. 5B), which is not revealed as a distinct layer in nc82-labeled specimens but instead blends with the next more ventral layer (Fig.  5A).

While this cell may help define a new, narrow layer, alternatively it may occupy an upper substratum of layer 1 or, more likely, based on nc82 labeling, a lower substratum of layer 2. FB layers 2-5 are shown in Figure 5D. Another large field neuron arborizes along the dorsal margin of the synapse-dense layer, identified here as layer 6 ( Fig. 5E1-E3). If this layer, FB'6d, and the previously mentioned FB'1d/2v, are ultimately determined to be separate layers, there would be at least 11 layers in the FB.  The actual number of layers in the FB will likely remain unresolved until two prerequisites are met. First, the features of what constitutes a layer need to be formally defined. The two most likely options are to define them based on either function or anatomy, or perhaps as some combination of the two. Second, all neurons that arborize in the FB must be identified and consolidated into a single, standard brain so that their relative volumes can be compared directly.",

            "text": "It has been assumed that the number of columns is identical in all layers. While a columnar architecture is evident in nc82-immunolabeled brains in all layers except the cap, the picture that is beginning to emerge from the work reported here is that neurons, including both PB-FB and FB neurons that do not have projections to the PB, do not organize themselves into columns in all layers of the FB. Rather, such a restricted pattern of arborization may be a phenomenon associated only with layers 1 through 5. (The only instance of columnar arbors in layers 4 and 5 comes from the PB G1-8 .s-FB'3,4,5.s.b-rub.b cell.) A more relaxed columnar arrangement is evident in layers 4 through 8 (with the exception of the PB G1-8 .s-FB'3,4,5.s.b-rub.b cell), in which the arbors of various cell types extend horizontally across a greater width than in layers 1 through 3 (e.g., PB.s-FB'6.b.'3.s-Vga-s.b; see Fig. 3, as well as several FB local interneurons). Furthermore, the diminutive, dorsalmost layer, layer 9, which spans only approximately the medial sixth of the FB, is unlikely to have eight or more columns. Data analyzed here support this prediction: a columnar organization is not evident in layer 9 in nc82-labeled brains, and of the neurons analyzed to date, each neuron that arborizes in this layer has processes that extend throughout more than half of the layer. Even in layers 2 and 3, where a columnar organization is clearly evident, the boundaries are not restrictive, in that arbors from neighboring columns frequently overlap. For example, the apparently presynaptic arbors of cells that arborize in FB'2 and FB'3, PB G2- (Fig. 3), occupy a geographic space that corresponds roughly to the upstream PB glomerulus in which these cells also arborize, although these arbors can show extensive overlap with those from cells in adjacent glomeruli. Finally, no PB-FB cells were identified in this study that target layers 7-9.",

In order to distinguish between these two possibilities and to reevaluate the options with the knowledge that there are 18 glomeruli in the PB, it was necessary to determine the number of columns in the FB. This number is difficult to evaluate given that the arbors of neurons overlap with one another, sometimes extensively.

The ventral margin of FB'1 is delineated by a total of seven distinct teeth resembling cogs, plus an additional two \"cryptic teeth\" that are elusive in that they are not evident in nc82-labeled samples, but only in specimens with the right combination of labeled cells. Five of the seven teeth are shown in the focal plane in Figure 6A; a cryptic tooth is seen in Figure 6B and Movie 3. The FB is shaped like a negative meniscus, curved such that the center is posterior to the edges, as previously reported (Hanesch et al., 1989;Strausfeld, 2012).  Hanesch et al. (1989) Wolff et al.   3G, 4, 8, 11,14 no G1 3H, 4, 7, 8, 10,13, 14, 17 Even glomeruli to ventral gall; odd glomeruli to dorsal gall; no G9 3I, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10,13, 15 The central tooth is most posterior and flanked on each side by three prominent and increasingly anterior teeth. The most lateral two cryptic teeth are the smallest and lie ventral and anterior to their nearest neighbors ( Fig.  6B,D, Movie 3). The cell type PB G2-9 .s-FB'1.b-NO 3 P.b (Figs. 3, 6C) reveals a total of nine columns in '1 of the FB. These cells arborize in eight glomeruli (G2-G9) on each side of the midline. Cells from two glomeruli, one ipsilateral and one contralateral, project to each of the seven distinct teeth. The lateralmost, cryptic teeth, however, receive input from just one contralateral glomerulus each ( Fig. 6D; the details of the wiring diagram are described below). PB G2-9 .s-FB'1.b-NO 3 P.b cells therefore reveal a total of nine columns in layer 1 of the FB. A second example of column number for '1 is illustrated by the previously unreported cell type FB'1.b-NO 3 P.s-LAL.s.bcre.s.b, which has distinct tufts of boutons in FB'1 ( Fig. 6E). In this cell, there are four tufts per side and two centrally located tufts (both of which occupy the larger, medial tooth). Each tuft stems from a separate branch, and each branch arises from the primary neurite; these branches help to distinguish the tufts. The arborization pattern of this large-field neuron is consistent with the observation that there are a total of nine columns in FB'1. (One could argue that there are 10 columns since the two medial tufts are distinct. However, since the center tooth is a single, morphological unit, we opted to consider the center tooth a single column.)",

The numbers beneath each tooth of the FB refer to the glomeruli from which they receive input, and \"i\" and \"c\" refer to ipsilateral and contralateral. The arbors from pairs of neurons that target the same teeth intermingle within the FB domains, although for clarity the colors are separated in the schematic. At the second junction, between the FB and NO, the primary neurites from G9-G6 cross the midline to arborize in the contralateral noduli (not shown). The remaining projections, from G5-G2, have already crossed the midline and therefore do not cross the midline again. E: Two examples of FB'l.b-NO 3 P.s-LAL.s.b-cre.s.b neurons [R44C06] highlight FB'1 teeth with tufts of boutons. Each tuft is located in a separate tooth with the exception of the central tooth, which houses two tufts; asterisks identify the tufts. A clear distinction between the left, lateral two teeth in the red example (right panel) is obscured in this focal plane, although the individual neurites leading to the tufts are evident and reveal the separate arbors. The two ventral tufts in both the green (left) and red (right) neurons that are not marked with asterisks arborize in the noduli. Movie 3 shows NO 1 , NO 2 and a small portion of the FB. The green cell originates from G2L in the PB and arborizes in the cryptic tooth of the FB (labeled C). The blue boutons are in the most lateral tooth and course from G9R in the PB. The more medial green arbor (not labeled) arises from G8R. Left scale bar 5 8 lm, right scale bar 5 10 lm in E. cell type, the EB.w.AMP.s-Dga-s.b cell (Fig. 7D), extends the entire depth of the EB, populating the anterior, medial, and posterior shells (AMP). (More specifically, this cell has spiny arbors in all three shells-anterior, medial, and posterior-of an EB wedge, and bouton-type terminals in an undefined region surrounding the dorsal gall, which we call the Dorsal gall-surround.) A previously uncharacterized R1-like neuron, EBR1.b-cre.s, also occupies the anterior shell (not shown).",

When like-colored primary neurites from different glomeruli overlapped one another, the circuits established from sparsely labeled brains were used as a guide to \"untangle\" their intersecting paths to their respective wedges in the EB. As necessary, color channels were toggled on and off to create different combinations of colors for each cell so that the precise arborization domains for each cell could be determined. This strategy, in combination with the circuitry template, enabled the following five conclusions to be drawn. 1) There are 16 wedges, and arbors sometimes fill just half a wedge (\"demi-wedges\"). There is no discernible anatomical distinction between cells that occupy entire vs. demi-wedges, other than the boundaries of the wedge arbor. 2) When two cells are labeled in a single glomerulus, their arbors either overlap completely in a given volume of the EB, or they occupy adjacent demiwedges. Of the 41 glomeruli labeled in these three brains, most had one or two labeled cells in a single glomerulus and just two had three labeled cells. In both instances of glomeruli containing three labeled cells, the arbors of two of these cells overlapped, whereas the third occupied an adjacent volume; it is likely that the two Figure 9. The EB comprises 16 wedges and 32 demi-wedges. A1-A3: Confocal images and schematics of MCFO-labeled protocerebral bridges and corresponding ellipsoid bodies from three densely labeled brains. Cell type: PB G1-8 .b-EBw.s-D/Vgall.b. Colors used in the schematics do not necessarily correspond to the colors in the confocal images because of color redundancy in the data panels. Two of the 41 labeled glomeruli shown in these three brains had three labeled cells each: G4R and G8R in A1. Note that in A1, the green cell in G4R transitions to yellow in the EB due to ramping of the laser power during imaging. To minimize confusion, this cell is green in the schematic in both the PB and EB. Brains shown in A1 and A3 are from line [R60D05]; brain in A2 is from [R33A12]. B,C: Demi-wedges are illustrated in these high magnification confocal images of small portions of two ellipsoid bodies. Two cells are labeled in the glomeruli (insets) corresponding to the wedges shown. For each example, three panels are shown. The first shows both cells (or both colors), followed by each color shown separately to illustrate the gap, or demi-wedge, occupied by the partner cell. The asterisks identify the two demi-wedges corresponding to a single wedge. Note that while there is some overlap between these EB arbors, there is a clear distinction between the two arbors that originate from the same glomerulus. B: An enlargement of a portion of the EB shown in A1; the region of interest is G4L, which contains a red and blue cell, shown in inset. See also Movie 5. C: The wedge labeled with blue and red arbors (9:00, red and yellow asterisks) exemplifies an instance in which the arbors from two cells from the same glomerulus both occupy the entire wedge. These cells arborize apparently presynaptically in G3R. The blue and green cells occupy adjacent demi-wedges of a single wedge and have their PB bouton arbors in G8L (inset). Brain shown in C is from line [R60D05] and is the same brain shown in Movie 6. Movie 5 The red and blue cells highlighted here with asterisks occupy adjacent demi-wedges of the same wedge. Cells both arborize in G4L of the PB (shown in Fig.  9). The gaps that appear when the red and blue channels are turned off are the demi-wedges. Movie 6 illustrates two cells with bouton-type arbors in a single glomerulus, G8L (labeled G8), and postsynaptically in adjacent demi-wedges in the EB. One cell is green, the second is blue; they arborize in the EB at 8:00. The densest regions of the spiny arbors in the demi-wedges, the spines (as in backbones), are marked with the paired blue and green asterisks. There is a second green cell that arborizes at about 11:00 in the EB that does not arise from G8L (yellow asterisk). A second pair of cells, one red and one blue (paired red and blue asterisks), projects from G3R (glomerulus not shown). These cells arborize in the EB at 10:00 and overlap extensively in either the same wedge or demi-wedge. The Z series of the blue cell illustrates the projection of the cell (orange arrow identifies primary neurite) that arborizes in G8 to the lower blue arbor in the EB (orange asterisk). Similarly, the Z series of the green cell shows the projection from G8 to the green demi-wedge in the EB (purple asterisk), although this path is more difficult to follow. volumes occupied by these three cells represent demiwedges of a single wedge. When only one cell was labeled in a glomerulus, it generally appeared to fill the entire wedge, although in some instances there was an unlabeled adjacent volume. There are likely to be more blank demi-wedges than can be discerned in these brains, but given the high density of labeled cells and the fact that spiny branches can spill into neighboring volumes (see 4, below), unlabeled demi-wedges are difficult to detect. 3) There is a 1:1 correspondence between glomeruli and EB wedges: Wedges and demi-wedges receive arbors exclusively from cells in a single glomerulus and arbors from a single glomerulus arborize in only one wedge or two paired demi-wedges. In other words, an arbor arising from a cell in one glomerulus has not been seen to share either a wedge or a demi-wedge with an arbor of a cell arising from a different glomerulus. (Note that this observation is primarily gathered from the sparsely labeled brains.) 4) Arbors from neighboring wedges can overlap at the edges of their arborizations domains, sometimes quite extensively (Fig. 10). 5) Arbors arising from cells that target G1 and G5 target wedges at clock positions 6:00 and midnight, respectively, with the left and right counterparts for each of these glomeruli falling on opposite sides of this midline (at approximately 11:30-12:00/12:00 to 12:30 and 5:30-6:00/6:00-6:30; see below for projection map details).",

It is not obvious how these two to three cells are distributed among the 16 glomeruli. The data shown in Figure 9 reveal that the simplest scenario, in which there are three cells per glomerulus, one that occupies the full wedge, and one for each demi-wedge, cannot be the case. Since as many as three cells can arborize in a single glomerulus and its corresponding wedge, an alternative possibility is that certain glomeruli are always targeted by three cells, and others always by two cells. No more than three cells were seen to arborize in a single glomerulus in these studies, perhaps excluding yet more complex combinations. Finally, it is possible that the volume occupied by the arbors of a particular cell is determined by a stochastic developmental event.",

NO 1 is also the brightest nodulus in nc82-labeled brains and, since nc82 is thought to label T-bar ribbons, this brighter signal may therefore reflect a greater density of presynaptic sites, suggesting that NO 1 has the highest synaptic density of the three noduli. The medial nodulus, NO 2 , is somewhat rectangular in shape in a frontal view and protrudes slightly more anteriorly than NO 1 . The ventralmost nodulus, NO 3 , is more square than NO 2 and occupies the largest volume of the three. NO 2 and NO 3 have distinct subcompartments that are revealed by distinguishable texture, contrast, and intensity in nc82-labeled samples and, more definitively, by arborization domains of cells that specifically target these subregions. NO 1 may also have subcompartments (see below). The nomenclature of \"subcompartments\" rather than separate noduli was chosen because these subregions are so tightly juxtaposed that there is no obvious break in nc82-labeling, and therefore no separation, between the units (Fig. 12B,D) as there is between NO 1 , NO 2 and NO 3 .

Ito et al. 2014consider it a subregion of the LAL, but this work suggests it is an independent neuropil adjacent to the LAL. Our analysis of neurons that target both the PB and the gall reveal that the gall consists of three subdomains. Two large subdomains compose the bulk of the gall and were also described by Lin et al. (2013), a dorsal (D) and a ventral compartment (V; also the most anterior of the three subunits; Fig. 13). The previously undescribed minor subdomain is the most posterior volume and lies at the dorsal tip of the gall, earning it the name \"gall tip\" (Fig. 13). All three compartments are targeted in a cell type-dependent manner. Cells that arborize in the dorsal gall are excluded from the gall tip. Only one cell type has been identified that targets the gall tip (see below). . B1: Orange cell is in G7 and arborizes in the dorsal gall; blue cell is in G6 and arborizes in the ventral gall. B2: Blue cell is in G8 and the ventral gall; red cell is in G7 and the dorsal gall. The apparent gap between the red and blue cells in the glomeruli is not an intervening glomerulus, but is a consequence of both a slightly buckled PB between G7/G8 and the fact that the blue arbor does not completely fill G8. B3: Red cell is in G4 (top) and the ventral gall (middle, frontal view), blue cell arborizes in G3 (top) and the dorsal gall (middle). Lower panel is a side view of the gall to illustrate that the apparent overlap of the red and blue arbors in the frontal view is a consequence of the fact that the D and V domains are staggered on the D/V axis.",

The projections from left to right and right to left are mirror symmetrical to one other (Figs. 14, 15).

The alignment of the projection pattern from PB to EB can be most readily visualized if the EB is filleted at its antapex (6:00 on an analog clock face) and stretched flat to derive the ancestral, linear form of the EB characteristic of non-Drosophilids. For both wedge and tile cells, the most lateral glomerulus from the left half of the PB aligns to the volume that lies approximately between 7:00 and 8:00 on a clock face, whereas the most medial volume from the left half aligns with 6:00 (5:30-6:30; Figs. 14, 15). For the right half of the PB, the most lateral glomerulus aligns Figure 14. Connectivity between the PB and EB tiles.

Schematics were derived from MCFO-labeled brains. Top: PB, middle: EB; bottom: filleted EB, as described in text. Glomeruli and their target EB volumes are color-matched. The numbers below the PB identify each of the glomeruli, whereas the black text around the EB denotes coordinates of an analog clock for use as reference. A: This wiring scheme represents the cell type PB G2-9 .s-EBt.b-NO 1 .b, which does not arborize in G1 (gray in PB). Two cells, one ipsilateral and one contralateral, arborize in each tile. The three distal glomeruli project ipsilaterally in the EB, G6 and G2 occupy the midline volumes (the zenith and nadir, respectively), and G3-G5 project contralaterally in the EB. This linear projection pattern is readily seen by comparing the PB to the filleted EB. B: Wiring scheme for PB G1-8 .s-EBt.b-D/Vgall.b cells, which do not arborize in G9 (gray in PB; [R33A12]). The same basic circuitry scheme illustrated in A applies to this cell type, but the ipsilateral/contralateral split is shifted laterally by one glomerulus since EBt.b-D/Vgall.b cells do not arborize in G9 but do arborize in G1. Therefore, the three most lateral glomeruli project ipsilaterally, G5 and G1 arborize in the midline volumes (the apex and antapex, respectively), and G4-G2 project to the contralateral EB. PB G1-8 .s-EBt.b-D/Vgall.b cells in even-numbered glomeruli project to the ventral gall whereas odd-numbered glomeruli project to the dorsal gall (labeled D and V above each glomerulus of the PB).",

Connectivity between the PB and EB wedges. This schematic was constructed based on MCFO-labeled PB G1-8 .b-EBw.s-D/ Vgall.b cells, which do not project to G9 (gray in PB). Schematics of the PB, EB, and filleted EB are shown. Between zero and three cells are labeled in each glomerulus. Alphanumeric labels on the EB and filleted EB indicate the glomeruli from which cells project to each volume; the number refers to the glomerulus number, R is shorthand for right, and L for left. Alternating wedges are filled with gray or white and demi-wedges are indicated by a solid line that divides each wedge. Various combinations of wedge and demi-wedge arbor fills are illustrated. For example, G8R illustrates an example with three labeled cells; the purple and yellow occupy one demi-segment in the EB, the green occupies the other demi-segment of the same wedge. G1R has two labeled cells, both of which fill the entire EB wedge that corresponds to G1R. G5L and G3R each have just one labeled cell, but G3R fills its entire corresponding wedge, whereas G5L fills just a demi-wedge. As with PB G1-8 .s-EBt.b-D/Vgall.b cells (above), PB G1-8 .b-EBw.s-D/Vgall.b cells project to either the dorsal or ventral gall in the same glomerulus-specific fashion: even-numbered glomeruli project to the ventral gall whereas odd-numbered glomeruli project to the dorsal gall, as indicated by the D and V designations above the PB. number of volumes in the PB (18) and EB (16 wedges or 8 tiles); 2) Information flow is evenly distributed between the two brain hemispheres, as the brain generally is bilaterally symmetric; 3) Most neurons cross the midline at some point in their trajectories; since cells of the central complex typically arborize in three structures, cells can remain ipsilateral between the first and second neuropils and cross the midline between the second and third neuropils, or they can cross the midline between the first and second neuropils. To maintain a balanced distribution of information flow, the point of crossover for cells that stay ipsilateral between the first and second substructures shifts by one glomerulus in cells that arborize in G1-G8 versus those that arborize in G2-G9 so that four glomeruli per side stay ipsilateral at the first junction and four cross contralaterally at the first junction. More specifically, for cells that arborize in G9-G2, G9-G6 stay ipsilateral at the first junction and G5-G2 cross the midline at the first junction (PB-EB; Fig. 14A), whereas for cells that target G8-G1, G8-G5 remain ipsilateral at the first junction and G4-G1 cross the midline at the first junction (Figs. 14B, 15; note that for tiles, two volumes are situated on the midline, one at 12:00 and the other at 6:00). Therefore, a given glomerulus does not correspond to one single volume in the EB. Rather, the correspondence between each glomerulus and its target volume in the EB depends on the cell type.",

            "text": "The circuits also differ slightly for cell types that arborize in the two types of EB volumes because there is a difference in the number of EB subdivisions: 16 wedges and 8 tiles. The 2:1 correspondence between glomeruli and EB tiles results in one ipsilateral and one contralateral glomerulus contributing cells that arborize in the same EB tile. The arbors in a given EB tile are not segregated, but rather are intermingled (Figs. 10,11,14). In contrast, there is a 1:1 correspondence between glomeruli and EB wedges: Cells in each glomerulus target separate wedge volumes in the EB and, in some cases, two cells from a single glomerulus occupy separate demi-wedges of the same wedge. In the case of circuits for cell types that arborize in G1-G8, the EB tile and wedge regions that correspond to specific glomeruli (wedges) or pairs of glomeruli (tiles) are identical. (For example, both G1 tile cells in Fig. 14B and G1 wedge cells in Fig. 15 target the 6:00 region in the EB.) For cell types that occupy G2-G9, corresponding regions in the EB shift by one volume, but the correspondence is effectively the same (compare Figs. 14B and 15 to Fig. 14A; in the G2-G9 cell type, it is the G2 cells, not the G1 cells mentioned above, that target the 6:00 region in the EB). In other words, although G8R and G2L (Fig. 14B) or the equivalent G9R and G3L (Fig.  14A) for tile cells occupy a single volume (roughly corresponding to clock position 4:00 to 5:00), the geometric coordinates of this volume are the same as the combined volume occupied by the corresponding G8R and G2L wedge cells (4:00-5:00). Finally, whereas tile volumes straddle the midline (both 6:00 and 12:00), the wedge volumes do not, but instead fall to either side of the midline.",

The arbors of cells from G9 occupy the lateralmost prominent tooth (not the cryptic tooth described above). Cells from G8 target the next, more medial neighbor, and cells from G7 project to the tooth adjacent to the central tooth. Both G6 cell arbors project to the large, central tooth, and those from G5, G4, and G3 arborize in progressively more lateral teeth on the contralateral side, with G3 cells occupying the most contralateral, prominent tooth. As a consequence of this projection pattern, the ipsilateral G9 cell arbors coarborize with the contralateral G3 cell arbors, the ipsilateral G8 cell pairs with the contralateral G4, and the ipsilateral G7 cell pairs with the contralateral G5. This wiring diagram is effectively identical to that seen between the PB and EB for PB G2-9 .s-EBt.b-NO 1 .b cells (Fig. 14A). In a wiring scheme that parallels that described for the PB-EB projections, the expectation is that the cells in G2 would project to the FB's equivalent geographic location of the antapex (i.e., the most lateral domains in the filleted EB and the cryptic teeth in FB'1)-and they do (Fig. 6D). However, unlike the other teeth of FB'1, which receive input from both an ipsilateral and contralateral cell, the arbors that arise from cells in G2 appear to be the sole occupants of their FB'1 domains. These domains are not readily apparent in nc82-labeled brains, but can be distinguished in samples in which either or both of the contralateral G9 and ipsilateral G3 cells are labeled (Fig. 6B). The cryptic tooth is ventral and anterior to the volume occupied by G9 and G3 cells, although it is not clear if the cryptic tooth is a separate tooth or just a separate subdomain of the most lateral prominent tooth to which the cells of G9 and G3 project. Therefore, at least for the PB G2-9 .s-FB'1.b-NO 3 P.b cell type (Figs. 3, 6C), FB'1 comprises either nine or seven columns, with cells of the most lateral cryptic teeth providing output from just one glomerulus and those of the remaining columns providing output from two glomeruli each (Fig. 6D).",

The PB G2-9 .b-IB.s-SPS.s cell elaborates a likely presynaptic arbor in the PB and an extensive, bifurcated, spiny arbor in the inferior bridge (IB) and superior posterior slope (SPS; Fig. 18A). As described for a subset of other cell types, PB G2-9 .b-IB.s-SPS.s cells sometimes arborize in multiple glomeruli, either adjacent or up Figure 17. A segregated circuit connects the dorsal and ventral gall to distinct volumes in the EB and PB. Two cells, PB.s-EBt.b-D/Vgall.b and PB.b-EBw.s-D/Vgall.b, relay information between the PB, EB, and gall. Information is relayed from the even glomeruli to corresponding tiles in the EB (as described in Fig. 14) and to the ventral gall via the PB.s-EBt.b-Vgall.b cells (cell A). Similarly, information is relayed from the odd glomeruli to the odd-corresponding set of tiles in the EB (see also Fig. 14) and to the dorsal gall via the PB.s-EBt.b-Dgall.b cells (cell C). Information is transmitted from the EB to the PB and gall via the PB.b-EBw.s-D/Vgall.b cells. Cells in the wedges that correspond to the even glomeruli deliver information to the even glomeruli and to the ventral gall via the PB.b-EBw.s-Vgall.b cells (B) and from the odd-corresponding wedges to the odd glomeruli and dorsal gall via the PB.b-EBw.s-Dgall.b cells (D). Both cell types occasionally extend tendrils, skipping their adjacent neighbor to maintain the odd/even integrity of a cell. The green cell is an example of the cell type shown in D, where the primary bouton arbor is in G1 and a single bouton from the same cell extends to G3. The light blue cell is an example of the cell type shown in A with a primary arbor in G4 and secondary arbor in G6.",

The wiring pattern may be the most unusual feature of this neuron. Whereas cells in G2-G7 for the most part follow the stereotypical projection pattern, G1 does not. In other cell types, and according to the projection pattern rules described above, cells that arborize in G1 cross the midline to project contralaterally. Unexpectedly, most G1-based PB G1-7 .s-FB'2.s-LAL.bcre.b cells follow an entirely ipsilateral tract: 13/17 such cells stay ipsilateral in the FB as well as the LAL and crepine. A few of these G1 arbors infiltrate the contralateral G1, so by strict definition these cells do not follow absolute ipsilateral trajectories. The remaining 4/17 project contralaterally, crossing the midline at the first junction (between the PB and FB). This ipsilateral G1 projection pattern is highly atypical and, consequently, the nature of the information relayed by this class of neurons, in particular by G1, and the significance of information flow from the center of the PB to the ipsilateral central brain, is intriguing.",

First, the length of the apparently presynaptic arbor along the lateral margin of the LAL varies, falling into three distinct categories. The short and medium length arbors reside completely in the LAL, whereas the long subtype extends the length of the LAL and then continues on into the inferior ventrolateral protocerebrum. The length of these \"dangling arbors\" is consistent within subtypes. There is no correlation between subtype and specific subsets of glomeruli. In other words, it is not the case that, for example, only short arbors correlate with G1-3, medium from G4/G5, and long from G6/G7. Instead, cells arborizing in all seven glomeruli for this cell type have been seen to give rise to each of the three LAL arbor lengths. Whether these three subtypes constitute separate cell types or not is debatable. Since the three subtypes appear in each of the GAL4 lines in which the cell type has been seen, it seems less likely they are distinct cell types. Second, the bouton arbor does not always extend into the crepine. (For simplicity, \"crepine\" is included in the cell's name.) This difference may have more to do with the somewhat arbitrary delineation of the boundaries of the LAL and crepine than with internal inconsistency with the cells' arborization patterns. Further complicating the projection pattern of this cell type, on rare occasions a small spur reaches from the FB into the EB.",

Instead, more often than not they follow an exclusively ipsilateral projection (66% of the time, n 5 8 of 12 instances). Notably, PB G1-8 .s-FB'3,4,5.s.b-rub.b cells represent one of only two cell types identified to date in which the G1 cell predominantly follows an ipsilateral path. (The other is the PB G1-7 .s-FB'2.s-LAL.b-cre.b cell, described above. Also, the ipsilateral variant of the PB G2-9 .b-IB.s-SPS.s cell maintains an entirely ipsilateral path, regardless of the glomerulus in which it arborizes.) Similar to the PB G1-7 .s-FB'2.s-LAL.b-cre.b cell type, PB G1-8 .s-FB'3,4,5.s.brub.b G1 cells project to the lateral margin of the FB. However, unlike the PB G1-7 .s-FB'2.s-LAL.b-cre.b cell, the G1 arbor from PB G1-8 .s-FB'3,4,5.s.b-rub.b cells is the most lateral arbor in the FB, so it occupies an even more lateral volume than does the G8 contralateral projection. This is the volume that corresponds to that typically occupied by the contralateral G1 cell's arbor. G2, G3, and G4 cells project contralaterally, and cells from G5 are inconsistent in their projection patterns, always projecting close to the midline, but the arbors lie to either side of or on the midline. Furthermore, the projection pattern described here is identical to that described for the PB G1-8 .b-EBw.s-D/Vgall.b cell (Fig.  15, filleted EB). While this revised circuitry for the HFS necessitates reinterpretation of behavioral results for stimuli reaching the lateral PB, reinterpretation is probably not necessary for the revised ipsilateral G1 projection since the midline position of G1l and G1r probably means these cells receive the same visual input. Nonetheless, it is unusual for G1 to follow an ipsilateral trajectory.",

Like the PB G2-9 .b-IB.s-SPS.s cell described above, the PB 1-glomerulus -FB c,d,e,f !IDFP HB-medial cell also has two subtypes, one that arborizes in just one HB (the LAL) and a second that arborizes in both the right and left HBs/LALs. A cell that appears to be morphologically homologous to this PB-FB-LAL cell has been characterized in the locust, and also has two subtypes, CPU1 (which arborizes in a single LAL) and CPU2 (which arborizes bilaterally in both LALs; Heinze and Homberg, 2008). To the extent that it is possible to construct wiring diagrams from the images shown in these two studies, it appears that the circuits for these cells are also identical between Drosophila and Schistocerca. In addition, one cell type was identified in our study that was not characterized in Lin et al. (2013), the PB G1/ 2-9 .b-SPSi.s cell.",

Its PB arbor is spiny and very sparse, and while it clearly arborizes in the central brain, it is not clear if it arborizes elsewhere within the central complex. It is also possible that this \"cell type\" only constitutes a variant, as described for the EB.w.AMP.s-Dga-s.b cell.

For example, the arbor in the LAL for the PB G1-7 .s-FB'2.s-LAL.b-cre.b comes in three discrete lengths: short, medium, and long. It would be simplest to conclude that the only difference between these three variants of a single cell type is the geographic range over which each distributes information within the LAL. Here these variants are classified as subtypes of the same class of neuron, as they are assumed to relay the same information based on connectivity and morphology. The GAL4 patterns are consistent with this classification in that all three subtypes occur in each GAL4 line that expresses this cell. Similarly, for the PB G1-8 .b-EBw.s-D/ Vgall.b and PB G1-8 .s-EBt.b-D/Vgall.b cells, the population of cells from odd-numbered glomeruli arborize in the dorsal gall, whereas those that populate the even-numbered glomeruli target the ventral gall. Since the information relayed by the populations of odd and even glomerulitargeted cells is likely the same in a qualitative sense, the difference being only that it is segregated in its delivery to the dorsal and ventral regions of the gall, we assigned these two categories to the same cell type.",

The difference between these two cells is the number of apparently presynaptic arbors in the PB: the PB18.s-9i1i8c.b cell has three clusters of boutons whereas the PB18.s-GxD7Gy.b has just two. However, they both follow the same rule: they project spiny terminals throughout the entire extent of the PB and bouton-type terminals spaced at intervals with seven intervening glomeruli separating the output terminals. When the \"first\" (i.e., most proximal to the cell body) cluster of boutons occurs in G9, there are sufficient glomeruli remaining to accommodate two of these intervals of seven glomeruli (interval 1: D7 includes G8i to G2i and interval 2: D7 includes G1c to G7c) and three clusters of boutons (G9i, G1i, and G8c). Furthermore, no instance of the PB18.s-GxD7Gy.b cell has been seen with a cluster of boutons in just G9 and G1, which would represent the expected G9 (and also G1) version of this cell type. In addition, these two cell types are always coincident in the lines in which they have been observed, suggesting that they share many aspects of their genetic programming. While the PB18.s-GxD7Gy.b cell type may simply not arborize in G9 or G1, it seems more likely that PB18.s-GxD7Gy.b and PB18.s-9i1i8c.b cells are representative of the same cell type, and the difference in arborization pattern (three vs. two clusters of boutons) is simply a consequence of the glomerulus in which the most proximal cluster occurs. Ultimately, behavior or physiology will determine whether these cells perform the same function, and transcript profiling will reveal whether they express the same genes and thus belong to the same class.",

Consequently, because there are two subsets of PB neurons, the glomerulus that targets a given column, wedge, or tile is shifted by one glomerulus, depending on the subset of cell type. Furthermore, the observation that no small-field neurons arborize in all 18 glomeruli suggests the number of columns in the FB and wedges in the EB would not need to exceed 16 in order to maintain a 1:1 correspondence between the PB and FB/EB.",

The most lateral FB column (or EB wedge) is occupied not by the ipsilateral G9 (or G8 for the G1-G8 cells), as previously described, but instead by the contralateral G2 (or G1 for the G1-G8 cells). This circuit therefore reverses the pattern in the second neuropil (FB or EB) from one in which the most lateral (L) glomeruli project to the most lateral columns (or wedge or tile) on the ipsilateral side to one in which the medial (M) glomeruli from the contralateral half of the PB project to the most lateral columns.

In fact, communication is even more specific: layer 3 of the FB communicates directly only with NO 2 , layer 2 directly only with the anterior subcompartment of NO 3 , and layer 1 directly only with NO 3 M and NO 3 P. Furthermore, the cells in G1 do not communicate directly with the noduli at all-neither via the FB nor via the EB. The absence of direct connections between the PB and upper layers of the FB is also noteworthy.

For example, some identify commonalities in function between neuropil subregions, such as FB'2 and NO 3 A, which are both arborized by a common neuron. Other circuits reveal spatial segregation between neuropils. The most intriguing instance is the exclusive relay of information between the ventral gall and even-numbered glomeruli and the dorsal gall and odd-numbered glomeruli, which demonstrates that both information and information flow can be spatially segregated from the glomeruli to the gall. It will be interesting to learn the functional role of the gall and why it segregates a portion of the information it receives and sends, as well as what sort of behavioral response requires this rigidly alternating spatial distribution in the PB. Finally, the absence of connections between neuropils may prove informative in functional studies. For example, G1 is distinct from G2-G8 in that it lacks direct connections with the noduli, and NO 1 is distinct from NO 2 and NO 3 in that it communicates with the PB via the EB rather than the FB, raising the questions of what behaviors G1 does and does not contribute to, and what the differences are in behavioral outputs from NO 1 and NO 2 /NO 3 .",

Either some or all of these species also have 18 glomeruli, or an extra pair of glomeruli arose in Drosophila.

The degree of overlap of arbors in neighboring wedges is evident in the examples shown in which color channels were separated to illustrate the individual neurons. B: Arbors consisting of boutons also extend into neighboring tile domains, illustrated in these five examples. Asterisks identify boutons from PB G1-8 .s-EBt.b-D/Vgall.b cells that intrude into neighboring tile domains. C: Schematics illustrating the extension of spiny (top) and bouton (bottom) arbors into adjacent domains.",
