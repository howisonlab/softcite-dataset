            "text": "Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). However, intrinsic and acquired resistance to bortezomib has already been observed in MM patients. In a previous report, we demonstrated that changes in the expression of mitochondrial genes lead to changes in mitochondrial activity and bortezomib susceptibility or resistance, and their combined effects contribute to the differential sensitivity or resistance of MM cells to bortezomib. Here we report that the combination treatment of bortezomib and 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME), a natural estrogen metabolite, induces mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death of bortezomib-resistant MM KMS20 cells via mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction. Bortezomib plus 2ME treatment induces a higher level of cell death compared with treatment with bortezomib alone and increases mitochondrial ROS and Ca 2 \u00fe levels in KMS20 cells. Pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine scavenges mitochondrial ROS and decreases cell death after treatment with bortezomib plus 2ME in KMS20 cells. Moreover, we observed that treatment with bortezomib plus 2ME maintains the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4/7 (MKK4/7). Collectively, combination treatment with bortezomib and 2ME induces cell death via JNK-MKK4/7 activation by overproduction of mitochondrial ROS. Therefore, combination therapy with specific mitochondrial-targeting drugs may prove useful to the development of novel strategies for the treatment of bortezomib-resistant MM patients.",

            "text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic plasma cell disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. 1 Strategies for MM treatment have focused on the development of anticancer drugs that reduce the number of abnormal plasma cells in affected patients. Bortezomib is a boronate-based, dipeptidyl proteasome inhibitor that has been approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat relapsed/ refractory MM that primarily targets the chymotrypsin-like activity of the intracellular proteasome enzyme complex. 2,3 However, bortezomib therapy can cause both intrinsic and acquired resistance in MM patients. 4,5 In numerous cases, targeted compounds have shown limited efficacy when used as monotherapies, likely due to the multi-step process of tumorigenesis. 6,7 Therefore, there is a growing need for the development of optimal combinations of these novel agents to improve the survival of patients suffering from myeloma. Recently, we reported a role for mitochondria in resistance to bortezomib-induced cell death and found that human MM KMS20 cells were resistant to bortezomib due to potentiation of mitochondrial function. 8 In that report, changes in the expression levels of certain genes, such as cyclophilin D, the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, and superoxide dismutase 2, led to changes in both mitochondrial activity and bortezomib susceptibility or resistance; their combined effects contributed to differential sensitivity or resistance of MM cells to bortezomib. Specifically, we showed that changes in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels via depletion of superoxide dismutase 2 and treatment with 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME), known as a SOD inhibitor, induced bortezomib-resistant MM cell death. However, the mechanisms that regulate the enhancement of cell death after treatment of bortezomib-resistant KMS20 cells with a combination of 2ME and bortezomib remain unknown.",

As shown in Figure 1b, cell death was induced slightly in bortezomib-resistant KMS20 cells but was induced in over 50% of bortezomib-sensitive KMS28BM cells. Therefore, KMS20 cells showed resistance after a single treatment with either bortezomib or 2ME. To examine the beneficial effect of combination treatment with bortezomib and 2ME, we performed flow cytometric analyses after labeling with PI/annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate in KMS20 cells. KMS20 cells were cultured in different concentrations of bortezomib containing 1 mM 2ME for 48 h. Combination treatment significantly increased cell death in KMS20 and KMS26 cells in a bortezomib dose-dependent manner (Figure 1c). To verify whether the effects of combination treatment were induced by apoptosis, sub-G1 phase DNA content was measured after bortezomib or combination treatment of KMS20 cells. DNA content analysis also revealed a population of cells in the sub-G1 hypodiploid phase, indicating that apoptosis was significantly increased in KMS20 cells treated with bortezomib plus 2ME in a bortezomib dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1d).",

We examined whether mitochondria were involved in combined treatmentinduced cell death. In the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, the signaling mediator between the cytosol and mitochondria is cytochrome c. Thus, cytochrome c release was compared in bortezomib-treated KMS20 cells and in cells treated with both bortezomib and 2ME. Cytochrome c release was markedly increased in the cytosol of cells treated with both compounds compared with cells treated only with bortezomib ( Figure 2b). As a result of this release, caspase-3 activation was subsequently enhanced in cells receiving the combination treatment compared with cells receiving a single treatment (Figure 2a). These results indicate that KMS20 is a bortezomib-resistant MM cell line and that combination treatment with 2ME can induce a cell death mechanism in these bortezomib-resistant cells. Moreover, we reported that mitochondrial activity contributes to the differential sensitivity or resistance of MM cells to bortezomib in our previous study. Thereby, we propose that the combination treatment of 2ME and bortezomib may induce cell death via the regulation of mitochondria activity of bortezomib-resistant KMS20 cells.",

            "text": "To investigate the connection between induction of cell death by combination treatment and mitochondrial activity in bortezomib-resistant MM, we examined mitochondrial function by assessing [Ca 2 \u00fe ] M , DC m and mitochondrial ROS production. First, we measured mitochondrial ROS levels using an oxidant-sensitive fluorescent dye, Mito-SOX red. While bortezomib treatment alone did not trigger superoxide anion production in KMS20 cells, the combination treatment resulted in a remarkable increase in mitochondrial ROS levels (Figures 3a and d). Next, we determined whether the increase in mitochondrial Ca 2 \u00fe concentrations contributes to cytotoxicity after combination treatment. KMS20 cells were incubated in the presence of different bortezomib concentrations plus 2ME (1 mM) for 48 h, treated with rhod-2AM and subjected to flow cytometry (Figure 3b). We observed an increase in [Ca 2 \u00fe ] M after bortezomib plus 2ME treatment. However, the increase in [Ca 2 \u00fe ] M was independent of the dose of bortezomib, as shown in Figure 3b. We next examined the effects of bortezomib plus 2ME on the levels of DC m in KMS20 cells. The levels of DC m were measured using TMRE, which accumulates in mitochondria via a DC m -driven process. Because uptake of TMRE into mitochondria depends on DC m , a collapse of DC m is associated with a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of TMRE. Flow cytometric analyses of red fluorescence indicated that the combination treatment of KMS20 cells exhibited a depolarization of DC m and that this response increased according to the dosage of bortezomib as the level of mitochondrial ROS (Figure 3c). Taken together, these data suggest that increased mitochondrial ROS levels may cause combination treatment-induced cell death in KMS20 cells.  Increased mitochondrial ROS levels after bortezomib plus 2ME treatment induces KMS20 cell death via prolonged JNK activation To determine whether the increase in mitochondrial ROS levels causes cell death in response to combination treatment, we used NAc as an antioxidant. 16 We found that NAc successfully scavenged mitochondrial ROS after treatment with bortezomib plus 2ME in KMS20 cells (Figure 4a). Next, we examined the effects of treatment with bortezomib plus 2ME and NAc in KMS20 cells by performing a western blot (Figure 4b). KMS20 cells treated with bortezomib plus 2ME were more sensitive to bortezomib-mediated cell death than a single treatment with bortezomib. Pretreatment with NAc reduced the rate of cell death that had increased after combination treatment with 2ME and bortezomib in KMS20 cells. Moreover, the effects of combination treatment were fully reversed by the addition of zVAD-fmk, whereas it was not increased by the addition of L-buthionine-sulfoximine, a known pro-oxidant. These results suggest that the increase of ROS via 2ME treatment can overcome bortezomib resistance. Therefore, we performed flow cytometric analyses after labeling with PI/annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate in KMS20 cells to confirm these results (Figure 4c). As shown in Figure 4c, the pattern of cell death was identical to the western blotting results. Especially, increase of cell death by addition of L-buthionine-sulfoximine was not observed as well as in western blot. These results indicate that cell death induced by treatment with 2ME plus bortezomib likely involves mitochondrial ROS overproduction. Additionally, JNK, whose activation is sustained by mitochondrial ROS, 21 was also phosphorylated after combination treatment. From these data, we propose that activation of JNK is actively involved in the induction of cell death after bortezomib plus 2ME treatment.",

However, a majority of patients with relapsed or refractory MM do not respond to such treatment, and resistance is common. 23,24 Here, we show that the treatment of bortezomib-resistant MM cells with bortezomib plus 2ME induces cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction, which regulates resistance to apoptosis in response to bortezomib. Thus, to develop an effective therapeutic regimen for bortezomib-resistant MM, we evaluated the effects of this combination treatment on mitochondria dysfunction so as to increase cell death susceptibility in response to bortezomib. We demonstrated different susceptibilities of three MM cell lines: KMS20, KMS26 and KMS28BM (Figure 1). KMS20 cells were shown to be quite resistant to bortezomib treatment. Even the highest concentration (100 nM bortezomib) failed to induce more than 50% apoptosis in KMS20 cells. On the other hand, KMS20 cells treated with bortezomib plus 2ME displayed abrupt apoptosis in a bortezomib dose-dependent manner (Figures 1c and d). Moreover, when bortezomib and 2ME were administered in a dose-dependent manner, procaspase-8 was cleaved into activated caspase-8 ( Figure 2). Cleaved caspases-8 activate procaspase-3, which induces cells to undergo apoptosis. Cytochrome c is also released from mitochondria by activated caspase-8. From these data, we believe that the combination treatment of bortezomib plus 2ME is a novel, promising therapy for bortezomib-resistant MM.",

Mitochondrial Ca 2 \u00fe levels increased regardless of bortezomib dose after combination treatment (Figure 3b), whereas DC m drastically declined according to bortezomib dose (Figure 3c).

            "text": "To evaluate the role of mitochondrial ROS, KMS20 cells were treated with bortezomib plus 2ME in the presence or absence of inhibitors for caspase (zVAD-fmk) and ROS (NAc). As shown in Figure 4a, mitochondrial ROS levels that were increased after combination treatment were attenuated by pretreatment with NAc. Cell death induced by combination treatment was reduced by pretreatment with zVAD-fmk and NAc, suggesting that the effects of combination treatment on MM cell death involve coordination among caspases and ROSdependent pathways. This interpretation is based on the increase in apoptosis seen after 2ME, presumably via a mitochondria redox-dependent mechanism. 25 The hypothesis that ROS has a critical role in apoptotic signal transduction has emerged from several observations. ROS production induced by 2ME was previously described in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, 15 and treatment of leukemia cells with 2ME resulted in apoptosis via the generation of superoxide anion. 13 Figure 6 Proposed mechanism for the acceleration of cell death induced by bortezomib plus 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) treatment of bortezomib-resistant multiple myeloma (MM) cells. The cytotoxic effect of bortezomib seems to arise partially from inhibition of the antiapoptotic transcription factor nuclear factor B. Bortezomib has also effects on MM biology, such as dysregulating Ca 2 \u00fe homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis (red line). However, single-bortezomib therapy can cause both intrinsic and acquired resistance in MM patients. In bortezomib-resistant MM cells, bortezomib alone failed to reach a critical threshold to induce apoptosis because of improvements in mitochondrial activities, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination via increases in antioxidant proteins, membrane potential and calcium capacity, resulting in the negative regulation of the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic cell death pathway (red lines). Conversely, when bortezomib plus 2ME treatment is used, overproduction of ROS in mitochondria is induced, diffusing ROS outside of mitochondria and blocking both mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases and MKK4/7. This causes the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), via phosphorylation and activation downstream of ASK1, which is activated via ROS, eventually leading to the activation of a caspase cascade and cell death (black lines).",

            "text": "Our data show that JNK phosphorylation is linked to cell death after combination treatment with bortezomib plus 2ME (Figure 4b). JNK activation and cell death induction after combination treatment were both decreased by pretreatment with NAc and zVAD-fmk. In addition, H 2 O 2 has been shown to activate all three types of MAPKs in diverse cell types. 16,[32][33][34][35][36] We have confirmed the activation of all three types of MAPKs in KMS20 cells after bortezomib and 2ME treatment (Figure 5a). JNK activation, but neither p38 nor ERK activation, was consistently induced after combination treatment. These data suggest that cell death after combination treatment with bortezomib plus 2ME depends on JNK activation via increased ROS levels due to mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the JNK activation pathway has both pro-and anti-apoptotic properties. 37 In other words, sustained JNK activation is predominantly associated with induction of apoptosis, whereas transient JNK activation is involved in cell survival. 38 As shown in Figure 5b, our results clearly show that the sustained activation of JNK, which may be attributable to the inactivation of MAPK phosphatases by ROS, 21,39,40 was induced by bortezomib plus 2ME treatment in parallel with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In contrast, the activation of both p38 and ERK was maintained after combination treatment of KMS20 cells. Furthermore, our data show a sustained phase of MKK4/7 phosphorylation (a known activator of JNK), in accordance with poly (ADPribose) polymerase cleavage, in KMS20 cells treated with bortezomib plus 2ME. These results suggest that mitochondrial ROS after combination treatment acts to regulate only JNK activation in KMS20 cells. Collectively, these findings allow us to propose a comprehensive model for the role of combination treatment with bortezomib and 2ME in bortezomib-resistant MM cells ( Figure 6). Among the proteins known to be involved in redox signaling, ASK1 is the best-characterized ROS target molecule. 41 ASK1 activation, induced by ROS, results in the activation of the MKK-JNK pathway. 42,43 Moreover, mitochondrial ROS leads to the prolonged activation of JNK via the inactivation of MAPK phosphatases. 21,39,40 Eventually, prolonged activation of JNK leads to the activation of caspases and cell death.",

            "text": "In summary, this study reports for the first time that combination treatment with bortezomib and 2ME is a novel therapeutic strategy for bortezomib-resistant MM; combination treatment facilitates the leak of ROS due to mitochondrial dysfunction, sustains the activation of the JNK/caspase axis and induces bortezomib/2ME-mediated cell death in bortezomibresistant MM. Given that combination treatment specifically induces the death of bortezomib-resistant MM cells, the combination of bortezomib and 2ME offers excellent translational potential and promises to be a novel MM therapy.",
