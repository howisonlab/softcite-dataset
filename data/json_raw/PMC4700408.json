To study the role of NODs in the host response to Mycobacterium leprae, we measured the mRNA levels of NODs and related genes in infected mouse tissues. The mRNA expression of NOD1, NOD2, caspase-1 and ASC was increased in mouse footpads. Whereas NOD2 expression in macrophages was increased at 2 and 24 h post-infection with M. leprae, there was no expression of NOD1 at these time points. An increase in caspase-1 expression was observed at 2 h and continued at 24 h. However, the expression of ASC was increased only at the early time point. The expression of caspase-1 is regulated by NOD2-dependent pathway in established HEK 293. Our results suggest NOD2, rather than NOD1, may be associated with the host response to M. leprae and that caspase-1 activation is essential for the host response."

In the present study, RAW 264.7 cells (a macrophage cell line) were exposed to M. leprae overnight, and the levels of IL-1\u03b2 production and caspase-1 activity were measured. Consistent with our previous results, M. leprae bacilli induced caspase-1 activation and a low level of IL-1\u03b2 production in RAW cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, LPS induced higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 production under the same conditions, suggesting that the low level of IL-1\u03b2 production was due to the doubling time of M. leprae. To determine whether caspase-1 is essential for IL-1\u03b2 secretion in M. leprae infection, RAW cells were incubated with the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CMK for 1 h before infection, and then caspase-1 activity and IL-1\u03b2 secretion were measured. The M. leprae-induced IL-1\u03b2 secretion was blocked in cells that lacked caspase-1 (Fig. 1A and B), suggesting that caspase-1 activity is necessary for IL-1\u03b2 secretion in response to M. leprae infection.",

Compared to uninfected cells, mRNA levels for NOD1 and NOD2 were increased at 1 h after infection with M. leprae. Whereas NOD2 ex- pression was increased at 2 and 24 h post-infection with M. leprae, while the expression of NOD1 was not affected at 2 and 24 h post-infection ( Fig. 3A and B). Increased caspase-1 expression was observed at 2 h and continued at 24 h (Fig. 3C). However, Fig. 3D shows that the expression of ASC, a major adaptor protein involved in the inflammasome, was increased only at the early time points (1 and 2 h).",

Our results from the current study showed that M. leprae also induced caspase-1-mediated IL-1 secretion in RAW 274.7 cells (Fig. 1). NLRs, one of the two major classes of PRR in the innate immune system, provide a crucial interface between invading bacterial pathogens and the host immune system. Activation of NLRs by bacterial products can stimulate the NF-\u03baB pathway, a key regulator of the pro-inflammatory response, activating genes that are in-volved in immune responses to stimuli. Two NLRs, NOD1 and NOD2, induce caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 expression via large protein complexes named inflammasomes.",

There was low response to M. leprae in NOD1-transfected cells, but a higher response in NOD2-transfected cells in caspase-1 expression ( Fig. 4). We expected that HEK 293T cells transfected with both receptors (NODs) to have a significantly higher response than cells transfected with either one alone. However, there was no synergistic effect between NOD1 and NOD2 in the response to M. leprae (Fig. 4). Therefore, our results suggest that NOD2, rather than NOD1, is associated with the host response to M. leprae infection. The future study will examine the role of NODs in host infected with M. leprae using siRNA and knock-out mice.",
