            "text": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a condition normally detected in people with type II diabetes. It eventually leads to cardiovascular diseases in the patient. Visfatin is an adipocytokine which is secreted from adipose tissue and can affect the inflammatory reaction and also serum lipid levels. Additionally, omega-3 inhibits the accumulation of fat and formation of insulin resistance. The current study tried to investigate the effects of omega-3 on blood pressure compared to placebo and the relationship between serum visfatin levels and blood pressure. METHODS: A total number of 71 women with type II diabetes were randomly assigned to 2 groups to receive either omega-3 capsules or placebo capsules. In the first step, a questionnaire consisting age, height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure was filled out for each subject. Blood samples were then collected for laboratory tests. The next step was to conduct 8 weeks of intervention. All variables, except age, were measured again after the intervention. Hip circumference was considered as the maximum circumference of the buttocks. Waist circumference was measured by placing a tape horizontally across the abdomen at the end of a normal exhalation. Laboratory tests included the assessment of visfatin, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations. Lipid profile, i.e. low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG), and cholesterol, was also assessed. Using SPSS18, data obtained from the study was analyzed by a variety of appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: There was a significant change in mean differences of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressure showed a significant reduction in the omega-3 group compared to the placebo group. However, no significant changes were observed in systolic and diastolic blood pressure before and after the intervention (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, a daily consumption of omega-3 is suggested for patients with type II diabetes.",

            "text": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 150 million people are currently suffering from type II diabetes. This figure is predicted to be doubled by the year 2025. 1 Today, the disease is detected in all age groups, including women and high risk groups. Mortality rates in diabetic individuals after adjusting for age is 1.5-2.5 times more than total population. 2 Since in most cases, insulin resistance and diabetes are associated with obesity, obesity and overweight are considered as the major causes of diabetes and insulin resistance. 3 In addition, hypertension is common in people with diabetes and its prevalence increases substantially over time. On the other hand, omega-3 intake may reduce blood pressure. 4 Alpha lipoic acid reduces hypertension in people with type II diabetes. 5 The prevalence of hypertension increases with age in both sexes. 6,7 In 1989, one fourth of America's total population and one third of its adults suffered from high blood pressure. At the same time, hypertension developed in 30% of urban community adults in the East Mediterranean region. 8 Visfatin is an adiponectin with insulin-like function 9,10 which was discovered in adipose tissues by Fukuhara et al. in 2005. 11 Omega 3 increases visfatin secretion in patients with type II diabetes. 12 Obesity can lead to hyperplasia and hypertrophy of fat cells which secrete a variety of compounds with exert critical roles in the pathogenesis of diseases such as metabolic syndrome, hypertension, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular diseases. 13 Omega-3 fatty acids have been demonstrated to reduce cholesterol, triglycerides, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. They may also prevent insulin resistance. Omega-3 fatty acids downregulate the expression of genes and hormones (such as leptin) involved in obesity. They also prevent the construction of omega-6 compounds. In type II diabetics, consumption of over 4 grams of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can increase serum glucose and reduce triglyceride. 14 Visfatin is a regulator of fat metabolism 15 which has a direct relation with body mass index (BMI). 16 Being directly relate with waist to hip ratio (WHR), serum visfatin level is higher in diabetics compared to normal healthy people. 11 This study was designed to investigate whether omega-3 lowers blood pressure in diabetics and if there is any significant relationship between serum visfatin level and blood pressure in people with type II diabetes.",

Kesavulu et al. proved that omega-3 supplements had beneficial effects on triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzymes, which eventually lowered vascular complications in diabetics. 25 In 1991, Malasanos and Stacpoole conducted a study on patients with type 2 diabetes. They suggested that EPA could lower the levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins, increase fluidity of cell membranes, and reduce platelet aggregation and blood pressure. 26 Omega-3 intake has also been suggested to have a weight control effect on diabetics. 27,28 In 2007, Dogru et al. conducted a study on 33 young patients who had recently been diagnosed with hypertension. It investigated the relationship between visfatin and blood pressure. To omit the possible confounding effects and relations between BMI and visfatin, patients with BMIs less than 25 were recruited to the study. However, no significant relationship was detected between serum visfatin level and blood pressure which was identical with the results achieved in this study. 18 It has also been shown that the insulin receptor is associated with hypertension. 13 Moreover, the insulin receptor and inflammation can be effective on the development of hypertension. 29 However, our results did not support this role for visfatin.",
