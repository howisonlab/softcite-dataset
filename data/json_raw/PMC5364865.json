            "text": "The retina of the human eye is extremely vulnerable to oxidative damage. Previous studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress is the predominant mechanism associated with the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa. MTP-131, a novel mitochondria-targeted peptide, has been demonstrated to specifically concentrate in the inner mitochondria membrane and to exhibit remarkable antioxidant effects both in vitro and in animal models. In the present study, the protective effect of MTP-131 was evaluated in response to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2)-induced oxidative damage in a retinal ganglion cell line, RGC-5. Cell viability was measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Changes of mitochondrial membrane potential and generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining was used for assessment of apoptosis. Release of cytochrome c was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Pretreatment of cells with MTP-131 inhibited H 2 O 2-induced cytotoxicity and reduced LDH release in a dose-dependent manner, compared with cells treated with H 2 O 2 alone. Mitochondrial depolarization and ROS generation were also prevented by MTP-131 pretreatment. In addition, MTP-131 pretreatment inhibited cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm, and significantly reduced apoptosis in RGC-5 cells, compared with cells treated with H 2 O 2 alone. In conclusion, mitochondria-targeted peptide MTP-131 exhibited a protective effect against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in RGC-5 cells, which may provide a novel approach for the treatment of age-associated retinal diseases.",

In human eyes, the retina is extremely vulnerable to oxidative damage. Oxidative stress has been demonstrated to be the predominant mechanism associated with the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (3)(4)(5)(6). Novel strategies targeting mitochondria and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation may provide promising prospects towards antioxidant therapy in these retinal diseases.",

Schiller (7), is a water-soluble peptide with an alternating aromatic cationic motif (D-Arg-dimethylTyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 ) and a 3+ net charge at physiological pH (8). The fraction of the peptide partitioned to mitochondria has been estimated to be 1,000 to 5,000-fold compared with the extra-mitochondrial concentration, and the peptide is predominately localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane (7). MTP-131 reduces ROS production in a dose-dependent manner and prevents oxidative damage in neuronal cell lines (9). In addition, treatment of mice with MTP-131 prevents loss of neurons and increases survival in PD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis animal models (10).",

P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.  Fig. 2A, left  panel), while incubation with 500 \u00b5M H 2 O 2 alone for 2 h led to mitochondrial depolarization, resulting in loss of the TMRM dye from the mitochondria and a decrease in fluorescence intensity ( Fig. 2A, middle panel). Pretreatment of the cells with 1 \u00b5M MTP-131 for 1 h, however, inhibited H 2 O 2 -induced mitochondria depolarization, as evidenced by the higher fluorescence intensity of TMRM in the MTP-131-treated cells ( Fig. 2A, right panel) compared with the cells treated with H 2 O 2 alone. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that pretreatment with MTP-131 significantly prevented H 2 O 2 -induced mitochondria depolarization in a dose-dependent manner, compared with cells treated with H 2 O 2 alone ( Fig. 2B and C).  (Fig. 3B and C).",

            "text": "In the present study, the antioxidant effect of MTP-131 against H 2 O 2 -induced sustained oxidative stress was examined in undifferentiated RGC-5 cells. The present findings demonstrated that MTP-131 treatment prevented mitochondrial depolarization, decreased intracellular ROS production, and inhibited apoptosis induced by sustained oxidative stress in RGC-5 cells. H 2 O 2 is widely used to induce oxidative stress in experimental studies, leading to an increase in intracellular accumulation of ROS and RGC apoptosis (14)(15)(16). In the present study, H 2 O 2 (500 \u00b5M for 24 h) was used to induce a sustained oxidative stress, and was demonstrated to cause significant cell damage in RGC-5 cells, which is consistent    with previous studies (14). MTP-131 pretreatment protected RGC-5 cells from mitochondrial membrane depolarization, reduced ROS production and inhibited cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm. These effects were demonstrated to alleviate apoptosis in RGC-5 cells, thus suggesting that MTP-131 exhibited a potential protective effect against oxidative stress in RGC-5 cells through direct inhibition of mitochondria-mediated pathways. RGC-5 cells have been widely used in in vitro experimental studies (17)(18)(19). However, the validity of this cell line is now questioned. It has been demonstrated that the RGC-5 cell line is of mouse origin, not rat as it was first described, and that it express photoreceptor markers instead of retinal ganglion markers (20,21). However, RGC-5 cells still have several properties in common with retinal progenitor cells and is therefore appropriate for neuronal cell studies (20). A series of retinal disorders have been related to oxidative damage, such as AMD, DR and RP (3,4,6). The retina is constantly exposed to visible light, which makes it extremely vulnerable to oxidative damage, due to its great energy demands and high oxygen consumption (5). A previous study have demonstrated that oxidative stress is extremely important in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. ROS induces mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE, leading to RPE cell apoptosis and death of photoreceptor cells (22).",

            "text": "Compared with traditional antioxidants, MTP-131 represents the only known class of cell-permeable compounds that specifically concentrates in the inner mitochondrial membrane (7). With a 3+ net charge, MTP-131 selectively binds to cardiolipin and modulates its interaction with cytochrome c. By inhibiting the cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex peroxidase activity, MTP-131 optimizes mitochondrial electron transport and ATP synthesis (23,24). Numerous in vitro and animal studies have demonstrated the remarkable efficacy of MTP-131 in age-associated diseases. For example, daily treatment with MTP-131 reverses mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibits neuronal apoptosis and inflammation in mice with sepsis-associated encephalopathy (25). In addition, MTP-131 exhibits protective effects against cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury (26). The effectiveness of cardiolipin combined with MTP-131 is currently being evaluated in a multinational clinical trial for reperfusion injury in patients with acute   coronary events (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01572909), and a Phase 2 trial is underway assessing the effectiveness of MTP-131 on improving renal function following angioplasty for severe renal artery stenosis (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01755858) (27). Since MTP-131 has a unique mitochondria-targeted delivery, and exhibits potent antioxidant and neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo, the present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of MTP-131 against H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative damage in RGC-5 cells. The present findings demonstrated that MTP-131 inhibited H 2 O 2 -induced mitochondria depolarization, reduced intracellular ROS and prevented apoptosis in RGC-5 cells.",

Incubation with 500 \u00b5M H 2 O 2 for 24 h resulted in loss of cell viability compared with untreated cells, and the percentage of LDH release was 28.62\u00b12.94% relative to the untreated cells (Fig. 1). Pretreatment with 1, 0.1 and 0.01 \u00b5M MTP-131 reduced LDH release in a dose-dependent manner compared to cells treated with H 2 O 2 alone, with LDH release measured at 6.05\u00b10.44, 13.08\u00b10.53 and 22.39\u00b11.73% relative to the untreated cells, respectively (P<0.01, P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively, compared with H 2 O 2 alone; Fig. 1). MTP-131 treatment prevents H 2 O 2 -induced mitochondrial depolarization. RGC-5 cells were pretreated with 1 \u00b5M MTP-131 for 1 h, and then incubated with 500 \u00b5M H 2 O 2 for 2 h. TMRM, a lipophilic cation which accumulates in mitochondria in a manner dependent on the membrane potential, was used to demonstrate \u0394\u03a8m in RGC-5 cells. As expected, untreated RGC-5 cells with healthy mitochondrial membrane potential exhibited high fluorescence intensity for TMRM (",
