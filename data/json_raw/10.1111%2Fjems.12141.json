We use a dataset constructed from over 12,000 search terms and 2 million users to identify drivers of the organic clicks that the top 759 retailers received from search engines in August 2012. Our results are potentially important for search engine optimization (SEO). We find that a retailer's investments in factors such as the quality and brand awareness of its site increases organic clicks through both a direct and an indirect effect. The direct effect stems purely from consumer behavior: The higher the quality of an online retailer, the greater the number of consumers who click its link rather than a competitor in the list of organic results. The indirect effect stems from our finding that search engines tend to place higher quality sites in better positions, which results in additional clicks because consumers tend to click links in more favorable positions. We also find that consumers who are older, wealthier, conduct searches from work, use fewer words, or include a brand name product in their search are more likely to click a retailer's organic link following a product search. Finally, the quality of a retailer's site appears to be especially important in attracting organic traffic from individuals with higher incomes. The beneficial direct and indirect effects of an online retailer's brand equity on organic clicks, coupled We thank the editor and two referees for helpful comments, and"

According to Alexa Traffic Rank, Google.com is the most popular web site in the United States as well as in the world, and in May 2011, it was the first web site to achieve one billion monthly unique visitors. 1 Many people use search engines as a starting point for navigating the Web, making search engines a crucial link in connecting content providers and users. This has spurred a sizable literature on search marketing that studies clicking behavior at search engines. To date, most of this literature has concentrated on the sponsored links that are typically displayed alongside organic links when consumers conduct searches."

To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first to provide search marketers with information on drivers of organic clicks to aid in SEO.",

Our research complements these studies by focusing on the organic clicks that 759 retail sites received from more than 12,000 search terms. There is considerable cross-sectional variation in our data: It includes Web-only retailers as well as traditional retailers and covers 15 different retail segments including apparel, electronics, and mass merchants. For each of these search terms, we observe which retail sites received organic clicks as well as the number of clicks. We also obtained data from the first five pages of search results on Google and Bing for each search term, and this ultimately permits us to quantify the impact on organic clicks of a site's rank (position) in the search results. Our data also include several different measures of the accumulated brand equity of online retailers. These data allow us to determine whether consumers are more likely to click the link of a retailer who is perceived to operate a high-quality site (as a result of the retailer's current and past investments in advertising, the depth and breadth of offerings, secure payments, one-click purchases, returns policies, and so on). Ultimately, this permits us to quantify the benefits of SEO strategies that attempt to gain traffic by improving a retailer's rank in organic search results, versus gaining traffic by improving the quality and brand awareness of a site."

The direct benefit of these and other investments in brand equity is an increase in the number of consumers clicking one retailer's link instead of a competing link on results pages. Moreover, investments in brand equity have an additional indirect effect: Search engines tend to place retailers with stronger brands in better positions, which results in additional increases in organic clicks. Finally, estimated effects of rank on organic clicks are keyword specific, whereas improvements in the brand equity of an online retailer increases clicks associated with all relevant searches. Taking all of these effects into account, we find that brand equity is as important as rank in determining organic clicks."

These benefits include increases in clicks through other online channels (such as price comparison sites), increases in the number of direct visits to a retailer's web site, increases in visits through navigational searches at search engines, and increases in traffic at the retailer's physical stores. These considerations-coupled with the fact that position is a zero-sum game and thus a retailer is unlikely to obtain a sustainable advantage through direct efforts to improve its ranking-lead us to conclude that brand equity is one of the more important components of retailers' SEO strategies."

For this particular search there are three top ads; the maximum number of top ads that may be displayed is four. The organic results (marked by the blue box) are listed below the top ads. Up to ten organic results can appear on a search result page.

Unlike organic links, retailers can directly influence the position of ads, which are displayed and ranked according to the results of an auction that is run in real time. Retailers identify keywords they want to bid on and specify how much they are willing to spend. Google determines the ad rank using a site's maximum bid specified for the keyword and a quality score, which includes factors like click-through rates and relevance. Advertisers only pay when the link is clicked; the cost per click is equal to the minimum amount needed to get a specific position (generalized second-price auction mechanism). There is an extensive literature (discussed below) examining this avenue for obtaining clicks."

One of the initial steps in this optimization process is identifying the benefits and costs of different strategies for increasing traffic. 6 Our paper represents a first attempt to examine the benefits side of the ledger, and in particular, to quantify the drivers of retailers' organic clicks.",

Search engines are themselves players, and have incentives to adapt algorithms to ensure that search engine users receive relevant results. Consumers are players too, and may favor links of retailers they know and trust: SEO strategies that focus exclusively on rank (such as spamming links or hiding keywords) might improve the position of a retailer's link but not impact its clicks. For this reason, SEO strategies based on \"tricking\" or \"spamming\" engines are unlikely to yield sustainable improvements in rankings, may not result in additional clicks, and can even backfire as a result of negative effects on reputation. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that rankings are effectively a zerosum game: One retailer can move up on a particular results page only by pushing down the link of another retailer. Thus, although it makes sense for online retailers to ensure that their sites include page titles that accurately describe content, make use of head tags, are free of dead links, and so on, these efforts alone are unlikely to give a particular retailer a sustainable rank advantage because other retailers have incentives to engage in these strategies as well."

This strategy recognizes that consumers tend to click retailers that are more recognized, trusted, have reputations for providing value (in terms of prices, product depth or breadth), service (well-designed web sites, return policies, secure payment systems), and so on.

However, the presence of an organic link increases the utility of a sponsored listing more than the other way around. Similarly, Agarwal et al.

Search Planner uses the comScore panel, which contains all online browsing activity of around two million U.S. users. Because our goal is to analyze the drivers of organic traffic following product searches, we restrict our sample to only include web sites that are Internet retailers. For this we make use of Internet Retailer's Top 500 Guide, which contains a ranking of North America's 500 largest e-retailers based on annual Web sales. Although not all of these retailers appeared in the comScore Search Planner database, some e-retailers (e.g., Amazon) operate multiple web sites (e.g., Amazon.com and Zappos.com), resulting in a total of 759 retail sites for which we have click-through data. For each of these 759 retailers, we used Search Planner to identify all search terms that generated traffic from Google to the retailer. There is some overlap in search terms: as shown in Figure 1, Onlineshoes.com as well as Zappos.com appear relatively high in the organic results for the term \"shoes online,\" which means that for both retailers this term is part of the set of search terms that generated traffic from Google. In total we end up with 12,184 distinct search terms that led users to the 759 online retailers. The third dataset we use contains all the links that appeared on the first five search results pages on Google Search and Bing Search for each of the 12,184 search phrases. We collected these data using a scraper written in Java; the data contain organic search results as well as paid links. 10 Not all 759 online retailers are relevant for each of the search terms in our data. For instance, Best Buy is not relevant for individuals searching for shoes and is therefore 9. Aaker (1991) defines brand equity as \"a set of brand assets and liabilities linked to a brand, its name and symbol, that add to or subtract from the value provided by a product or service to a firm and/or to that firm's customers.\" Brand equity is based on factors like brand loyalty, name awareness, and quality.

Given the intervening time between clicks and the collection of rank data, two potential issues arise: (a) endogeneity of position, which we address in Section 2.2, and (b) the stability of ranks over time. The limited data we have suggest that ranks for product searches are likely to be fairly stable over the relatively short window of time that is at issue here. For example, an examination of rank data we collected for two different projects reveals that, for the 3,599 overlapping observations in these two datasets, the (pooled) correlation between each firm's rank for searches conducted in July 2012 with its rank for the searches conducted in September 2012 is 0.80. Although we do not have more frequent (e.g., daily or weekly) data on ranks, the relatively high correlation in ranks over this 2-month period suggests that ranks are likely to be reasonably stable within the span of a single month."

(2012) to overcome challenges in measuring the \"prominence\" of online retailers' names. These authors point out that the standard approach, which uses historical advertising data to measure accumulated brand equity and the strength of a firm's name, is not useful in the case of online retailers. Among other things, many online retailers are privately held and do not disclose advertising expenditures; the parent companies of publically traded online retailers do not typically report monthly advertising expenditures at the URL level. They further argue that the number of product searches on Google (or Bing) that include the retailer's name or URL in the search query-navigational searches, in industry parlance-is a useful measure of a retailer's brand equity. Intuitively, the inclusion of \"Amazon\" in a product search indicates the consumer recognizes the company and can recall its name. This may be the result of past advertising campaigns, recommendations from friends, knowledge of Amazon's pricing practices, product depth, return policies, and so on. And in contrast to advertising expenditures, it is possible to use data from comScore to measure the number of navigational searches Amazon received in a given month.",

Baye et al. provide evidence that this measure works well in both retail and education contexts. 12 For example, they show that there is a strong relationship between navigational searches for universities and external rankings of their quality: Universities with stronger brand names (e.g., Harvard University) receive significantly more navigational searches than universities with weaker brand names (e.g., Indiana University). Moreover, they provide evidence that the prestige of a university-not its size-is the main driver of the navigational searches it receives."

Section 4 shows that our results are robust to the use of three alternative measures of brand equity that are also unlikely to be correlated with the errors.",

Complicating matters, Search Planner only reports the number of organic clicks if those clicks exceed a certain threshold, which means we do not know whether sites receiving zero organic clicks according to Search Planner really received no click-throughs for the search term in question or whether they were censored. What makes our setting different from a standard censoring environment is that the selection rule depends on total clicks (including paid clicks) rather than just organic clicks. This means that a different probability mechanism generates both the zero clicks and the positive clicks, and this cannot be captured by a standard Tobit censoring model. For this reason, we estimate a Heckman-type selection model. As we argued in the previous subsection, endogeneity is likely to be important in our data, so we allow for endogenous explanatory variables. Estimation of the model consists of two stages. In the first stage we regress a dummy for having positive clicks on all exogenous variables (including instruments) z. Here, it is important to include at least one more instrument than is necessary for dealing with the endogeneity problem (otherwise identification is purely based on the parametric form of the inverse Mills ratio). This additional exclusion restriction should relate to the probability of observing positive organic clicks. Because this probability relates to the number of total clicks, we use additional variables in the selection equation that are important for getting paid clicks: We add dummies for whether a sponsored link was displayed on each of pages 2 through 5 in the Bing search results. We obtain the inverse Mills ratio, given by\u03bb = \u03bb(z\u03b4) = \u03c6(z\u03b4)/ (z\u03b4) from the selection equation, and add this to the second stage to obtain"

But just how important is position in driving a retailer's organic clicks following a product search? The first two estimated coefficients in Table II provide an answer. The estimated coefficient for rank not observed captures the effect of a retailer's link not being included on the first five pages of search results for a given search term. The estimated coefficient of \u22122.335 is significant in both an economic and statistical sense, and implies that a firm not appearing on the first five pages receives 90% fewer clicks for a given search term. For a retailer whose link is observed on the first 5 pages, the estimated coefficient of \u22121.347 for ln(Rank) implies that a 1% decline in rank induces a 1.3% reduction in organic clicks for a given search term. For example, a retailer moving from the fifth to the sixth position in a search for \"jeans\" experiences a 27% reduction in organic clicks for that search term, whereas moving from the sixth to the seventh position results in a 22% decline. 17 Although these results indicate that rank is a very important driver of organic clicks following product searches, it is important to stress that the unit of observation underlying these results is Ra nk i,k ; that is, retailer i's position in the results for search term k. Thus, these rank coefficients measure the effect of improving a retailer's position for a single search term. Consequently, SEO efforts that are term specific (e.g., designed to elevate a retailer's rank following a search for \"jeans\" but that have no effect on positions following other product searches), will result in a much smaller percentage improvement in that retailer's total organic clicks. By way of example, the average retailer in our sample was relevant for about 60 search terms, so the corresponding effect on total organic clicks is about 1/60 th of the rank coefficients in Table II. For example, the estimated coefficient of \u22121.347 for ln(Rank) implies that a 1% improvement in rank following a given keyword search results in a 0.02% (= 1.347/60) increase in total organic clicks.",

The estimated coefficient for the logarithm of brand equity is positive and very precisely estimated, indicating that the direct effect of brand equity of a retailer's site is an important determinant of the organic clicks it receives following a product search. It is important to note that, unlike rank, brand equity is not search-term specific.

A 1% improvement in a retailer's brand equity directly increases its total organic clicks by 0.084%, owing to the fact that consumers more frequently click on its link instead of a competing one in the list of search results. Ultimately, this induces search engines to elevate the firm's position in all relevant searches, which results in an additional 0.101% increase in clicks. The total effect of a 1% improvement in a retailer's brand equity is therefore a 0.185% increase in total organic clicks. Unlike the impact of rank, this percentage increase applies to a retailer's overall clicks rather than the clicks stemming from a single search phrase. To illustrate, suppose a relatively unknown retailer gets 1,000 organic clicks from navigational searches and 30,000 through non-navigational searches. 19 If the retailer makes an investment in brand equity sufficient to increase its navigational searches by 10 clicks (1%), it gains an additional 55 (= 30, 000 \u00d7 0.185%) organic clicks from non-navigational searches.",

Unlike price comparison sites and other online channels where signals of these attributes may be separately observed (through displays that include user feedback ratings, third-party certification, prices, shipping costs, etc.), the only signals consumers observe in organic product search results are sites' names (which embody their brand equity) and their \"relevance\" (as proxied by the rank or position that the search engine's algorithm assigns each organic link). We also showed that our findings are robust to several alternative specifications and, importantly, to controls for censoring as well as the endogeneity of a retailer's rank or position in the list of organic results.

For retailer's above this virtual \"fold,\" the elasticity of clicks with respect to rank is about unity: a 1% improvement in rank leads to a 1% increase in organic clicks (for that search). Our results thus suggest that there are returns to SEO efforts that make it easier for search engines to determine a site's relevance for a particular product search. This includes making effective use of anchor texts, descriptive headings and meta tags, robot.txt files, and using accurate and unique page titles. However, although these sorts of strategies for SEO are necessary and important, our analysis suggests that it would be a mistake to make them the exclusive focus of SEO. Rankings are a zero-sum game, and other retailers also have strong incentives to ensure that their sites contain the information needed to be properly indexed by search engines. In light of best responses by other sites, these efforts may prevent a retailer from losing ranks due to miscommunication with search engines, but are unlikely to result in improvements in the equilibrium ranks of a particular retailer's link. Additionally, strategies designed to improve rank need not result in a long-run increase in organic clicks.

For example, our finding that searchers including the specific brand of a product (e.g., \"Levi's Jeans\" ) in a search are more likely to click an organic link suggests that retailers selling branded products benefit by ensuring that their sites present information about the brands in their portfolio in a way that allows search engines to properly index them. Likewise, searchers using longer keywords are less likely to click an organic link, so parsimony in this regard is also important for SEO."

            "text": "Our findings that individuals that are older, have higher incomes, or who conduct product searches at work are more likely to click organic links also have ramifications for SEO. Among other things, these results suggest that SEO is more likely to be important for retailers targeting consumers with these demographic characteristics. In addition, because the elasticity of organic clicks with respect to brand equity is higher for individuals with higher incomes, the marginal benefits of SEO efforts targeted at improving the quality and brand awareness of a site are greater for retailers targeting individuals with higher incomes. More generally, the key implication is that the benefits of SEO vary, depending on the demographic characteristics of the consumers retailers are attempting to attract through this channel."

            "text": "The relationship between sponsored links and organic clicks identified in our data highlights yet another set of spillovers that complicates the calculus of SEO. Retailers attempting to increase traffic through organic links should recognize that there are possible spillovers from paid links: Consumers are more likely to click organic links associated with sponsored links. On the surface, this might seem like a pure win for retailers, because a sponsored link that results in an organic click rather than a paid click costs nothing. This is unlikely to be part of a sustainable strategy, however. Ultimately, if consumers click a retailer's organic rather than sponsored link, its prospects for winning that sponsored link in an auction will decline, because search engines have little incentive to allocate scarce ad space to retailers that do not receive sponsored clicks."

            "text": "Our analysis has focused on the potential benefits of SEO by focusing exclusively on the drivers of organic clicks. We have not taken into account the costs of improving these drivers, such as the costs of improving the meta tags associated with a particular keyword to improve rankings or advertising through traditional media to improve the brand awareness of a site. Costs are obviously an important component of optimization, and it would be a mistake to base SEO decisions purely on the drivers documented above. Future research documenting the costs of different SEO strategies is therefore also important for the SEO literature."

            "text": "It is also important to recognize that search engines are only one of many online platforms where consumers conduct product searches. Baye et al. (2013) note that in June 2012, consumers using browsers conducted 634 million product searches at retailer sites (such as Walmart.com), 134 million product searches at price comparison sites (such as Dealtime.com), and 877 million searches at marketplace sites (such as eBay.com). They also point out that 70% of eBay's listings were for new products, and over 60% of its listings were through posted prices rather than auctions. Unlike SEO efforts designed to improve rankings at a search engine, SEO efforts to improve a retailer's brand equity can improve the clicks it receives from searches in these other channels. Because these spillover benefits are difficult to quantify, it is easy for those engaging in SEO to underestimate the benefits of investing in the quality and brand awareness of a site.",
