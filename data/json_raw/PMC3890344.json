However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the production of individual classes of neurons are poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the function of the thrombospondin-1-like glycoprotein, Nel (neural epidermal growth factor [EGF]-like), in the generation of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in chicks. During eye development, Nel is strongly expressed in the presumptive retinal pigment epithelium and RGCs. Nel overexpression in the developing retina by in ovo electroporation increases the number of RGCs, whereas the number of displaced amacrine cells decreases. Conversely, knockdown of Nel expression by transposon-mediated introduction of RNA interference constructs results in decrease in RGC number and increase in the number of displaced amacrine cells. Modifications of Nel expression levels do not appear to affect proliferation of retinal progenitor cells, but they significantly alter the progression rate of RGC differentiation from the central retina to the periphery. Furthermore, Nel protects RGCs from apoptosis during retinal development. These results indicate that Nel positively regulates RGC production by promoting their differentiation and survival during development."

This cellular diversity arises from multipotent progenitor cells by complex developmental mechanisms, including cell proliferation, fate determination, differentiation, and survival. Identification of the molecules and mechanisms that generate the proper number of neuronal cell types is one of the major goals of developmental biology."

            "text": "The retina has served as an excellent model system for studying the mechanisms of cell production in the vertebrate CNS. During development, progenitor cells in the presumptive neural retina give rise to six major classes of neurons and one glial cell class in an evolutionally conserved order, which follows a histogenetic sequence in the retina (Price et al., 1987;Holt et al., 1988;Wetts and Fraser, 1988). The first cells that emerge from the retinal progenitor cells are retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which are the sole output neurons in the retina and locate in the innermost layer (the ganglion cell layer [GCL]) of the mature retina (Prada et al., 1991). Whereas cell-intrinsic mechanisms play crucial roles in retinal cell diversification (Cayouette et al., 2006), several extrinsic signals derived from various sources in the eye influence RGC development (Isenmann et al., 2003;Agathocleous and Harris, 2009), including fibroblast growth factors (FGFs;McCabe et al., 1999, ",

            "text": "To explore potential functions of Nel in retinal development, we first examined its spatial and temporal expression patterns in the developing chick eye by RNA in situ hybridization. In chicks, invagination of the primary optic vesicle starts at Hamburger Hamilton stage (HH) 14 (embryonic day [E] 2.5), and the double-layered optic cup is formed at HH15 (E2.5). At those stages, Nel RNA expression was detected in the outer layer of the optic cup, the presumptive retinal pigment epithelium (RPE; Figure 1A). At HH20 (E3.5), Nel expression in the RPE increased, and, in addition, significant expression of Nel RNA was detected in cells that occupy the inner surface of the central retina ( Figure 1B), where newly differentiated RGCs reside. Nel RNA expression in RGCs increased between E4 and E6 ( Figure 1C). Expression of Nel persisted and continued to be restricted to the RPE and RGCs at least until E18 (Figure 1, C\u2032, D, and D\u2032). The observed strong expression of Nel in 2006; Martinez-Morales et al., 2005), Sonic hedgehog (Shh; Zhang and Yang, 2001a;Masai et al., 2005), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; Hashimoto et al., 2006), and Delta-Notch signaling (Austin et al., 1995). Considering the complexity of cellular and molecular interactions that mediate retinal development, however, it seems likely that additional extracellular signals are involved in regulation of RGC development.",

In mammals, two related genes were subsequently identified and termed Nel-like 1 (Nell1) and 2 (Watanabe et al., 1996;Kuroda et al., 1999). Based on sequence similarities, Nell2 appeared to be the mammalian orthologue of chicken Nel. In this article, we refer to both Nel and Nell2 as Nel. The Nel/Nell proteins have significant structural similarities with thrombospondin-1, which plays important roles in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions, such as tumor growth and metastasis, angiogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, and synaptogenesis (Adams and Lawler, 2011). The Nel protein contains an N-terminal thrombospondin-1 domain, five chordin-like/von Willebrand factor C domains, and six EGF-like domains (Matsuhashi et al., 1995(Matsuhashi et al., , 1996. Retinal sections prepared from different stages of chick embryos were hybridized with an RNA probe for Nel (violet). (A) HH14-15 (E2.5), (B) HH20 (E3.5), (C, C\u2032) E6, and (D, D\u2032) E18.

Retinal sections were then prepared and stained for Brn3a, a specific marker for RGCs in the retina (Xiang et al., 1995). Retinal neurogenesis occurs in a central-to-peripheral gradient (Snow and Robson, 1995;McCabe et al., 1999) and also shows slight temporal-to-nasal and dorsal-to-ventral gradients (Prada et al., 1991). We therefore compared the numbers of Brn3a-positive cells between equivalent areas (e.g., central-temporal area) of transfected and untransfected (contralateral) retinas. We found that the number of Brn3a-positive cells increased by approximately 40% in regions transfected with RCAS-Nel-IRES-EGFP ( Figure  2, G-L). Transfection of the control vector that expresses only EGFP did not affect the production of Brn3a-positive cells in the retina ( Figure 2L). During vertebrate retinal development, significant numbers of amacrine cells, which are mainly located in the superficial part of the inner nuclear layer (INL), migrate to the GCL. In chicks, those \"displaced\" amacrine cells are produced between E5.5 and E6.5 and comprise 20-35% of the total number of cells in the GCL (Galvez et al., 1977;Ehrlich and Morgan, 1980;Layer and Vollmer, 1982). Therefore next we examined whether Nel overexpression affects the number of displaced amacrine cells by using the amacrine cell marker syntaxin. We found that in the retinal regions where Nel is overexpressed, the number of displaced amacrine cells in the GCL significantly decreases. The total cell numbers in the GCL showed a slight increase after Nel overexpression, although this difference was not statistically significant ( Figure 2L). These results indicate that Nel overexpression promotes the genesis of RGCs and decreases the number of displaced amacrine cells in the GCL.",

We therefore examined the Nel protein distribution in the developing retina by immunohistochemistry using anti-Nel antibody (Jiang et al., 2009). The distribution of the Nel protein showed a very similar pattern to that of Nel RNA expression ( Figure 1, E-G), indicating that most of the secreted Nel protein remains in the layers of its origin. This result is consistent with our previous observation that Nel RNA and protein show similar layer-specific distributions in the developing chick optic tectum (Jiang et al., 2009). This limited diffusion of the Nel protein may be due to its heparin-binding activity (Kuroda et al., 1999;Nakamura et al., 2012), and the Nel protein may be trapped by heparin sulfate proteoglycans in situ soon after secretion from Nel-expressing cells.

As a negative control, we used a transposon vector carrying nonspecific miRNA sequences with the EmGFP marker gene (pT2K-CAGGS-Control miRNA-EmGFP). When introduced into cells with a transposase activity, the expression cassette would be excised from the plasmid and integrated into the host genome, allowing stable expression of the miRNA and the EmGFP marker ( Figure 3A). We electroporated the transposon vector of Nel miRNA with the transposase expression vector pCAGGS-T2TP into the optic vesicle at HH9-11 (E1.5). Electroporation efficiency was monitored by expression of EmGFP, and effects of RNA interference (RNAi) on Nel expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using anti-Nel antibody. At E4.5, endogenous expression of Nel was found to be significantly reduced in EmGFPexpressing cells in the RPE (Figure 3, B-D).

To achieve stable expression of transgenes, we used a transposon-mediated gene transfer system (Sato et al., 2007) that uses the antibody.

During development, RGC differentiation occurs in a central-toperipheral gradient, such that RGCs are initially produced in the central retina and then the wave of differentiation proceeds from the central to peripheral retina, much like an expanding circle (Snow and Robson, 1995;McCabe et al., 1999). In addition, it was reported that neurogenesis in the chick retina shows slight temporal-to-nasal and dorsalto-ventral gradients (Prada et al., 1991). To test whether Nel affects the progression of the RGC differentiation wave, we overexpressed Nel in half (nasal or temporal) of the retina at HH9-11 (E1.5), and examined the progression of RGC differentiation by immunohistochemistry for the RGC marker Islet-1 (Austin et al., 1995) at E4.5, when RGCs are still actively produced. Equal numbers of nasally and temporally transfected retinas were examined. We found that the overexpressing side of the retina contained significantly larger numbers of Islet-1-positive cells than the control side ( Figure 7, A, B, and E). Furthermore, compared to the control side, the peripheral edge or front of RGC differentiation reached farther from the central toward peripheral retina ( Figure 7, A, B, and F), indicating that Nel overexpression accelerates the movement of the RGC differentiation wave. Conversely, when expression of Nel was knocked down by RNAi in half of the retina, the knockdown side of the retina not only contained fewer Islet-1-positive cells, but also showed slower progression of the RGC differentiation wave (Figure 7, C-F). These results indicate that Nel enhances the rate of RGC differentiation and its progression from the central to peripheral retina.",

First, we tested whether Nel can enhance proliferation of progenitor cells in the developing retina. We electroporated RCAS-Nel-IRES-EGFP into the optic vesicle at HH9-11 (E1.5) and counted the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells after 3 h of in vivo labeling at E6. No significant difference in the number of BrdU-positive cells was observed between Nel-overexpressing and control areas ( Figure  6, A, B, and I). In addition, RNAi knockdown of Nel expression did not affect the number of BrdU-positive cells ( Figure 6, C, D, and J). In a separate set of experiments, retinal sections were examined by immunohistochemistry using anti-phosphohistone H3 (PH3)  Xenopus embryos, overexpression of FGF2 in retinal progenitor cells results in a 35% increase of RGCs without affecting retinal cell proliferation (Patel and McFarlane, 2000). Whereas both Nel and FGF1 accelerate the progression of RGC differentiation wave, the central-to-peripheral gradient of RGC differentiation is preserved in the presence of excess Nel or FGF1. Given that the cells at the wave front are more mature than those in the peripheral retina, these results may suggest that Nel and FGF1 act to stimulate further differentiation of nascent RGCs in final stages of RGC development (Jiang et al., 2013).",

These results suggest that in addition to acceleration of RGC differentiation, suppression of developmental cell death contributes to promotion of RGC production by Nel. Importance of developmental cell death in regulation of RGC numbers has also been shown by studies on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Application of BDNF to chick embryos in ovo significantly inhibits the earlier peak phase of developmental cell death in the retina and results in a 60-90% increase in RGC number (Frade et al., 1997).

Alternatively, the displacement of amacrine cells in the GCL may be negatively controlled by the number of RGCs in the layer, and thus the observed effects on the number of displaced amacrine cells may represent secondary effects due to the change of RGC number caused by modulation of Nel expression.",

During the initial stage of chick retinogenesis, FGF1 is expressed at high levels in the peripheral part of the developing retina (de Iongh and McAvoy, 1992).

Ablation of the RPE severely disrupts development of the neural retina (Stiemke et al., 1994;Raymond and Jackson, 1995). Interestingly, compared to pigmented wild-type mice, more RGCs are produced during the initial period of retinal neurogenesis in albino mice, which lack pigmentation in the RPE. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of pigment production increases the number of RGCs in eyecups isolated from pigmented mice (Rachel et al., 2002). A variety of growth factors are secreted FIGURE 7: Enhancement of the progression of RGC differentiation wave by Nel. (A-D) Nel was either overexpressed (A, B) or knocked down (C, D) in half (left side) of the developing retina by in ovo electroporation at HH9-11 (E1.5). Retinal sections were prepared at E4.5, and RGCs were detected by immunohistochemistry using anti-Islet-1 antibody (red). The areas of transgene expression are marked by expression of a GFP reporter (transfection side, green). Compared to the control side, Nel overexpression increased the number of RGCs and accelerated the progression of RGC differentiation wave. Conversely, RNAi knockdown of Nel decreased the RGC number and slowed down the rate of their differentiation.

            "text": "In the chick visual system, Nel is expressed not only in RGCs (projecting neurons), but also in the optic tectum (the main target of RGC axons in nonmammalian vertebrates). Nel expression in the chick tectum is detected as early as E5. Expression levels of Nel significantly increase between E8 and E12, and the high expression is maintained at least until E18. First RGC axons reach the tectum by E6, and RGC axons project to the specific layers (\"retinorecipient laminae\") in the superficial part of the tectum between E12 and E18. During this period, Nel expression in the tectum is confined to deeper layers of the tectum, which RGC axons do not normally innervate (\"nonretinorecipient laminae\"). Because Nel inhibits outgrowth of RGC axons and induces growth cone collapse and axon retraction in vitro, these results suggest that Nel may act as an inhibitory axon guidance cue that prevents RGC axons from invading inappropriate layers in the deeper part of the tectum and thus contribute to the establishment of the layer specificity in the visual projection (Jiang et al., 2009;Nakamura et al., 2012). In addition, in view of the functions of Nel in RGC production revealed in this study, it seems plausible that Nel could also have roles in differentiation and survival of tectal neurons in nonretinorecipient laminae.",

            "text": "It is intriguing that Nel exerts both positive (promotion of differentiation and survival) and negative (inhibitory effects on axons) effects on RGCs. Several other axon guidance molecules were also reported to exert both positive and negative effects on neurons. Such examples include ephrins, Wnt (Flanagan, 2006), and netrins (Moore et al., 2007). Because the Nel protein consists of different domains, it seems likely that different domains interact with distinct receptors and exert different functions, as is the case for thrombospondin-1 (Adams and Lawler, 2011). Interestingly, Nel exerts neuroprotective effects on cultured neurons at concentrations lower than those required for inhibitory effects on RGC axons (Aihara et al., 2003). This may suggest that Nel exerts inhibitory axon guidance functions and neuroprotective effects through distinct receptors that have different affinities for the ligand. Alternatively, the same receptor(s) may mediate both positive and negative signals in response to different concentrations of the ligand, as shown for Eph receptor-ephrin interactions (Hansen et al., 2004;Matsuoka et al., 2005). Further studies, including identification of its receptors, would be required to fully understand the molecular mechanisms of Nel functions. Nonetheless, it has become increasingly apparent that Nel is a multifunctional molecule that plays crucial roles in development of the vertebrate nervous system and its functions.",

            "text": "transposon-mediated gene transfer system (Sato et al., 2007). This method offers several distinct advantages. First, it supports stable expression of the transgene and thus persistent production of miRNA. Electroporation of conventional expression vectors permits only transient expression of the transgene, usually lasting only for several days in embryonic cells, because of the inability of the electroporated plasmid to be integrated into chromosomes. In contrast, the present method involves chromosomal integration of the expression cassette by activity of coelectroporated transposase and therefore can achieve stable expression of the transgenes. Second, the cells that express the transgene can be easily traced because each of the transfected cells is clearly marked by the EmGFP marker. Third, because expression of miRNA and EmGFP is driven by the same CAGGS promoter, the risk of promoter interference is avoided, which is one of the common problems with retroviral vectors containing an additional promoter to attain dual gene expression (e.g., Yee et al., 1987)). Finally, the areas of transfection can be controlled by properly choosing the type and positions of electrodes. Because this method does not use replication-competent retroviral vectors, there is no transmission of the transgene to neighboring cells after the electroporation. Within the transfected retinas, areas that do not express the transgene serve as a good internal control. Therefore this system provides a stable and efficient loss-of-function option and can contribute to the analysis of gene functions during chick development. potent target sequences were selected (corresponding to nucleotide numbers 482-502 and 2461-2481, respectively) and tandemly cloned into the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miRNA vector (pcDNA6.2-GW-Nel miRNA482/2461-EmGFP) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To construct the pT2K-CAGGS-Nel miRNA482/2461-EmGFP vector, cDNA sequences encoding the two pre-miRNA and EmGFP of the pcDNA6.2-GW/Nel miRNA 482/2461-EmGFP vector were amplified by PCR with an artificial EcoRI site on both ends (5\u2032-GGGAATTCTCTGGCTAACTAGA-GAAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCG AATTCCCTCTAGATCAACCACT-3\u2032) and cloned into the pT2K-CAGGS vector. The control pT2K-CAGGS-Control miRNA-EmGFP vector was constructed by cloning the corresponding region of the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miRNA negative control plasmid (Invitrogen) into the pT2K-CAGGS vector using the same set of PCR primers and restriction enzyme sites as mentioned.

(B-I) RNAi knockdown of Nel expression in the developing eye. A transposon construct containing an expression cassette of Nel miRNA and EmGFP was cotransfected with a transposase expression vector into the optic vesicle by in ovo electroporation at HH9-11 (E1.5). Retinal sections were prepared at E4.5 (B-D) or E8 (E-I), and expression of Nel was examined by immunohistochemistry using anti-Nel antibody (red).
