            "text": "Capsule endoscopy (CE) has revolutionized the diagnosis and monitoring of small bowel Crohn's disease (CD). The procedure is patient friendly and noninvasive, and compared to cross-sectional imaging, CE allows a direct and detailed evaluation of the entire small bowel mucosa with a high sensitivity for the earliest lesions of CD. Today, CE is the leading modality for visualizing the small bowel in suspected CD, and validated activity indices are available for the follow up of patients with established CD. CE of the entire gastrointestinal tract (panenteric CE) was recently introduced as a new diagnostic approach in patients examined for CD, and preliminary results are promising. There are important limitations, involving mainly capsule retention. Furthermore, a diagnostic criterion for CD has never been validated, and lesions detected by CE are not specific for CD. Hence, concern has been raised about a low specificity compared to other diagnostic modalities. Important questions about the optimal bowel preparation, selection of patients for CE and the optimal reading protocol remain to be clarified. The aim of this review is to evaluate the performance of CE for diagnosing CD and assess disease activity in known CD; to compare the diagnostic accuracy of CE to that of cross-sectional imaging; to discuss limitations; and to define the place of CE in the diagnostic algorithm in suspected or known CD."

            "text": "Before the era of capsule endoscopy (CE), the small bowel was considered inaccessible and difficult to examine. Endoscopic evaluation of the small bowel was limited to the most distal or proximal part, with ileocolonoscopy and push enteroscopy, respectively, or in selected cases intraoperative enteroscopy, all of which are invasive procedures requiring conscious sedation or general anesthesia [1]. Although radiological procedures such as magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and ultrasound have improved, they mainly visualize the transmural gut inflammation and have limited sensitivity for superficial lesions [2,3]. Since its FDA approval in 2001, CE has revolutionized small bowel imaging and important knowledge has been gained about its clinical use. The main indications for CE are obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, suspected Crohn's disease (CD), assessment of disease activity, mucosal healing and disease location in known CD, and discrimination between CD and ulcerative coliti s [4][5][6]. Other indications may include celiac disease, small bowel tumors, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) enteropathy, or polyposis syndromes. CE is a patient-friendly and noninvasive procedure and, compared to cross-sectional imaging, CE allows a direct and detailed evaluation of the entire small bowel mucosa with detection of the earliest lesions of CD [7]. However, there are important limitations, of which capsule retention is the main concern (Table 1)  [5,8,9].",

Furthermore, the Pillcam COLON2 (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) visualizes the small bowel, although it was designed for diagnosing the colon. Specifications provided by the manufacturers are shown in Table 2. Although CE systems are based on comparable technologies, important differences exist: e.g. the number of cameras, frame rate, angle of view, viewing direction, image resolution, and battery life. Theoretically, these differences could influence the diagnostic sensitivity for CD and the rate of complete small bowel examinations. However, studies comparing different CE systems head-to-head in patients with suspected or known CD are currently not available. In CD, the majority of studies have been performed with the Pillcam SB1 and SB2, as this CE system has dominated the world market for years. In patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, studies comparing Pillcam SB1 with EndoCapsule [12,13], Pillcam SB2 with MiroCam [14,15], Pillcam SB2 with CapsoCam [16],  and EndoCapsule with MiroCam [17] found no significant differences in diagnostic yields.",

            "text": "Numerous studies have examined the effect of bowel cleansing regimens on mucosal visualization, diagnostic yield and completion rates, and results have been included in several systematic reviews and meta-analyses [18][19][20][21]. Original studies are heterogeneous in terms of included patients and scales used for determining the visualization quality. Results of individual studies are conflicting and meta-analyses have applied different inclusion criteria, with varying recommendations. In a meta-analysis of prospective randomized studies, including 291 patients who had polyethylene glycol (PEG) administered before CE and 232 controls, the small bowel visibility was significantly better with PEG (odds ratio [OR] 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.96-4.94), whereas no significant difference could be demonstrated between sodium phosphate treated patients and those on fasting only [21]. Overall, bowel cleansing increased the diagnostic yield compared to fasting alone (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.24-2.84). Simethicone improves the mucosal visualization but the effect on diagnostic yield remains to be established [22]. Prokinetics do not seem to affect the small bowel CE completion rate [20]. Hence, the current evidence suggests a bowel cleansing regimen containing PEG and simethicone before small bowel CE. However, additional studies on this matter are warranted. It should be emphasized that studies mainly included patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and only a minority of patients were examined for CD. Whether bowel cleansing improves the mucosal visualization, diagnostic sensitivity and disease severity assessment in patients with CD is unknown. On the other hand, bowel cleansing causes discomfort, and currently, there is no consensus on the use of bowel cleansing before CE in patients examined for CD.",

In the subsequent clinical study, 7% of patients with a normal baseline CE developed 1-3 mucosal breaks after placebo treatment. This raises an important question about the diagnostic criterion and minimum threshold for diagnosing CD in patients examined with CE. At this point, no such criterion has been validated [23,26]. As suggested by Mow et al, the most frequently used diagnostic criterion for CD with CE is the presence of >3 ulcerations in patients not using NSAIDs [27].",

            "text": "Numerous studies have examined the clinical application of CE in patients with suspected or known CD. In the metaanalysis by Dionisio et al, the diagnostic yield of CE in patients with suspected CD was superior to that of small bowel radiography (52% vs. 16%, P<0.0001, n=155), computed tomography enterography (CTE) (68% vs. 21%, P<0.0001, n=53) and ileocolonoscopy (47% vs. 25%, P=0.009, n=59) [28]. Compared to MRE, CE had a higher diagnostic yield, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (55% vs. 45%, P=0.43, n=31). These results suggest that CE is the best modality for diagnosing small bowel CD. However, the lack of a gold standard comparison may lead to false conclusions, because false positive lesions count as true lesions and this tends to favor the most sensitive modality. Although the majority of studies have used multiple ulcerations as the diagnostic criterion for CD, the diagnostic threshold differs between studies and some studies included non-specific lesions or the diagnostic criterion was not described [29][30][31][32][33]. In a 4-way comparison of CE, CTE, small bowel follow-through and ileocolonoscopy, the specificity of CE (53%) was significantly lower compared to the other tests, supporting a high diagnostic yield because of false positive lesions [30]. A downside of this study, however, was that no criterion for diagnosing CD with CE was applied. A consensus gold standard based on the clinical presentation and results of all four modalities was used, but individual cases of disagreement were not discussed. Other prospective studies have compared CE with varying gold standards, showing a high sensitivity and specificity of CE for diagnosing CD (Table 3)  [7,29,34].",

The diagnostic yield of CE was 67% and 21% in patients with or without increased markers of inflammation, respectively. A diagnosis of CD was obtained in 25% of patients, primarily in patients with abdominal pain, diarrhea and elevated markers of inflammation. Likewise, in a study by De Bona et al, CE detected lesions consistent with CD in 46% of patients with suspected CD and elevated biomarkers of inflammation compared to 8% in patients with normal biomarkers [36]. An elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level has been shown to have sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of 73%, 69% and 89%, respectively, for diagnosing CD in the small bowel [37]. However, other studies have provided less favorable results. In a retrospective study of 189 patients with known small bowel CD, an elevated CRP was poorly associated with significant inflammatory lesions detected by CE, consistent with the body of evidence in general showing a suboptimal sensitivity of CRP for CD [38][39][40]. Hence, in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of CD but a normal ileocolonoscopy, elevated markers of inflammation seem to be associated with an increased diagnostic yield of CE, and in this situation CE should be considered. However, the sensitivity of CRP is inadequate and a normal value does not exclude small bowel CD.",

Some studies have reported lower levels of fCal in small bowel CD compared to CD involving the colon [43,44], whereas other studies have found equal levels and a high sensitivity of fCal for small bowel CD [45]. Similarly, data on the ability of fCal to predict findings from CE have been conflicting. In a retrospective study by Koulaouzidis et al, fCal >100 mg/kg was a good predictor of small bowel CD detected with CE in patients with suspected CD but a negative bi-directional endoscopy, and fCal <100 mg/kg excluded small bowel CD [46]. In subsequent studies, however, fCal was an inadequate biomarker for inflammatory lesions in the small bowel, with a sensitivity of 59-70% and a specificity of 44-71% [38,47]. In a recent meta-analysis that included 463 patients with a clinically relevant indication for performing CE, fCal >50 mg/kg had a sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 53% for detection of small bowel CD [48].",

At the present time, international guidelines recommend small bowel imaging in all patients with a clinical suspicion of CD, irrespective of the findings at ileocolonoscopy (evidence level 5, recommendation grad D), and CE should be the first-line investigation in patients without obstructive symptoms ( Fig. 2A)  [8,26,51]. In patients with obstructive symptoms or known stenosis, crosssectional imaging, such as MRE or CTE is preferred. However, additional studies determining the benefit and clinical impact of performing CE in adult patients with suspected CD after ileocolonoscopy are warranted. Future guidelines should also consider noninvasive markers such as fCal as a tool for selecting patients for ileocolonoscopy. An alternative algorithm based on a single prospective study of fCal, ileocolonoscopy, CE and cross-sectional imaging in suspected CD has previously been published by our group [50]. Patients with an elevated fCal should undergo colonoscopy, including a persistent attempt to intubate the terminal ileum. In patients with a normal ileocolonoscopy or non-complicated CD in the colon and/or terminal ileum, small bowel imaging provides little extra information compared to ileoscopy alone. Small bowel imaging is primarily indicated if ileoscopy is not achieved and CE is the preferred first-line imaging technique. MRE and CTE are complimentary modalities preferably used in patients with stenosis detected at ileocolonoscopy or suspicion of extra-intestinal disease complications. Additional studies are required to validate this diagnostic approach.",

It should be emphasized, however, that original studies excluded patients with a radiological suspicion of small bowel stenosis.

Compared to cross-sectional imaging, CE detects significantly more lesions in the proximal small bowel, primarily in the form of mild lesions [7,58]. The clinical significance of this diagnostic information has previously been debated [26]. However, a recent retrospective study of 108 patients with known CD found jejunal lesions in more than half of the patients, and the presence of proximal lesions was an independent risk factor for future clinical relapse (adjusted hazard ratio of 1.99; 95% CI, 1.10-3.61; P=0.02) [59]. Hence, the greater sensitivity of CE for proximal small bowel lesions compared to cross-sectional imaging seems to have prognostic importance and an impact on clinical decision-making. Furthermore, the discomfort experienced by the patient is significantly lower with CE compared to cross-sectional imaging, and 78% of patients would prefer this modality as a future examination [7,60].",

A Lewis score <135 excluded CD with a negative predictive value of 92%. Hence, in patients with suspected CD, a normal Lewis score virtually excludes the diagnosis. In patients who have findings consistent with CD, i.e. multiple ulcerations, both the Lewis score and CECDAI may be applied to quantify the disease severity and location.",

Hence, CE may serve as an objective tool for monitoring the treatment response and mucosal healing [40,65,66]. The clinical benefit of using CE as a disease monitoring tool with treatment escalation in patients who have not achieved mucosal healing needs to be shown. No studies have compared CE to cross-sectional imaging in relation to these matters.",

Detection of post-surgical recurrence may have important therapeutic implications. Boureille et al compared CE to ileocolonoscopy for the detection of post-surgical recurrence in 32 patients a median of 6 months after an ileocolonic resection [69]. With a composite gold standard including both the results of ileocolonoscopy and CE analyzed by two observers, the sensitivity of CE was inferior to that of ileocolonoscopy for the detection of disease recurrence in the neoterminal ileum (62-76% vs. 90%, respectively). However, CE detected inflammatory lesions outside the reach of the colonoscope in two thirds of patients. The severity of lesions detected with ileocolonoscopy and CE correlated significantly (r=0.54-0.64, P<0.05). In a similar study by Pons Beltran et al, both endoscopic procedures were performed in 22 patients 6-12 months after ileocolonic resection [70]. Ileocolonoscopy and CE detected post-surgical recurrence in the neoterminal ileum in 6 and 15 patients, respectively. Lesions beyond the reach of the colonoscope were detected in 13 patients with CE, including 3 patients without involvement of the neoterminal ileum. All patients preferred CE over ileocolonoscopy.",

Lesions of increasing severity found on ileocolonoscopy are a strong predictor for clinical recurrence, and current guidelines of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommend ileocolonoscopy 6-12 months after surgery in cases where treatment decisions may be affected [26].

Furthermore, Yadav et al concluded that the Pillcam patency capsule and radiological examination were equally reliable for excluding small bowel obstruction or strictures [73]. Hence, available studies suggest that the Pillcam patency capsule is equal to radiology and is a safe method for testing small bowel patency before CE, even in patients with Table 4 Validated indexes for determining the severity of Crohn's disease in the small bowel with capsule endoscopy A: Lewis score Villous appearance (for each small bowel tertile*) Number: normal (0) or edematous (1) Longitudinal extent**: short segment (8), long segment (12) or whole tertile (20) Descriptor: singe (1), patchy (14) or diffuse (17) Ulcer (for each small bowel tertile*) Number: no ulcers (0), one ulcer (3), two to seven ulcers (5) or eight or more ulcers (10) Longitudinal extent**: short segment (5), long segment (10) or whole tertile (15) Descriptor: <\u00bc (9), \u00bc-\u00bd (12) or >\u00bd (18) of the capsule picture occupied by the largest ulcer a radiologically verified stenosis.

The mean reading time was reduced from 22 down to 12 min, and detection rates of angioectasias, erosions, ulcers, and polyps were significantly lower with quad view. However, in patients with suspected or known CD, overlooked lesions did not change the result of the examination. Recently, Nakamura et al compared single view, dual view and quad view at different frame rates, using a small bowel video sequence with 60 pathological images of small bowel angioectasias [79]. Increasing the frame rate from 10 to 15, 25 and 40 fr/sec resulted in a 33%, 60%, and 72% reduction in playing time, respectively, but at the expense of a drop in the number of lesions detected. Altering the viewing mode had no effect on the reading time for any given frame rate, but the detection rate was significantly higher with dual and quad view compared to single view.

The quick view function provided by Given Imaging's RAPID Reader filters the number of images shown. With a sampling rate of 10% (default setting), 10% of images from the original videos is shown. Images are filtered according to a specific algorithm developed by the manufacturer, and sampling rates between 2% and 80% can be chosen. Shiotani et al examined how different sampling rates affect the detection rates of quick view CE [80]. A variety of preselected lesions were included in the study. With sampling rates of 5%, 15%, 25% and 35%, 61%, 74%, 93% and 98% of lesions were detected. With a 25% sampling rate, only 7% of lesions were missed, and the reading time was reduced by approximately 50%. This setting was considered a proper trade-off between reading times and detection rates. Koulaouzidis et al studied 81 patients with suspected or known CD [81]. A total of 155 and 71 ulcerations were detected with CE and quick view CE, respectively, with a 35% sampling rate, corresponding to a miss rate of 54%. In patients with suspected or known CD, quick view CE was false negative (i.e. no or non-specific lesions or <3 ulcerations) in 1 (7%) and 8 (10%) patients, respectively. In a study by our group, including 40 patients with suspected CD, standard view CE visualized 171 small bowel ulcerations, compared to 102 lesions detected with quick view CE (miss rate 40%, P=0.02) [82]. However, with ileocolonoscopy and standard view CE as gold standard, quick view CE diagnosed 15 of 16 patients with small bowel CD, corresponding to a sensitivity of 94%, while 39 out of 40 patients were classified correctly overall (diagnostic accuracy 98%). Reading times varied from 5-18 min (median 10).",

However, a reduced reading time comes at a cost, as increasing the speed results in lower detection rates. Data on patients with suspected or known CD are scarce, but available data suggest that, despite the fact that fewer lesions are detected, the overall sensitivity for CD is acceptable, and the quick view function may serve as a method for screening for CD lesions, especially in patients with suspected CD. Additional studies in patients with suspected or known CD are warranted and a generally accepted reading protocol has not yet been established [83].",

In a prospective study of patients with known CD, the number who reported discomfort was significantly lower with PCCE compared to ileocolonoscopy [86]. PCCE had a sensitivity of 86% for detection of ulcerations in the colon and terminal ileum, and lesions outside the reach of the colonoscope were detected in 15% of patients. There was a moderate correlation between PCCE and ileocolonoscopy for the assessment of disease severity. In a prospective study of 38 pediatric patients with CD, PCCE was compared to MRE and small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) [87]. The sensitivity of PCCE for detecting colonic inflammation was 89% and the specificity was 100%. In the small bowel, PCCE had 90% sensitivity and 94% specificity. The diagnostic accuracies of MRE and SICUS were slightly lower compared to PCCE, although the differences were not statistically significant. The tolerability of PCCE was superior compared to ileocolonoscopy, and the interobserver agreement was excellent (\u03ba = 0.91).",

The procedure is patient-friendly and noninvasive and, compared to cross-sectional imaging, CE allows a direct and detailed evaluation of the entire small bowel mucosa with a high sensitivity for the earliest lesions of CD. Today, CE is the leading modality for visualizing the small bowel in suspected CD, and validated activity indices are available for the follow up of patients with established CD. CE of the entire gastrointestinal tract was recently introduced as a new diagnostic approach, and preliminary data show high sensitivity, specificity, interobserver agreement and tolerability compared to ileocolonoscopy. There are important limitations, however, of which capsule retention is the main concern. Furthermore, a diagnostic criterion for CD has never been validated and lesions detected by CE are not specific for CD. Hence, concern has been raised about a low specificity compared to other diagnostic modalities. Future studies should address important questions about the optimal bowel preparation for small bowel and panenteric CE, the selection of patients with suspected or known CD, the optimal reading protocol and the diagnostic performance of panenteric CE compared to cross-sectional imaging."
