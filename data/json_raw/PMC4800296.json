            "text": "Background: The mTOR-inhibitor everolimus improves progression-free survival in advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNETs). However, adaptive resistance to mTOR inhibition is described. Methods: QGP-1 and BON-1, two human PNET cell lines, were cultured with increasing concentrations of everolimus up to 22 weeks to reach a dose of 1 mM everolimus, respectively, 1000-fold and 250-fold initial IC 50. Using total DNA content as a measure of cell number, growth inhibitory dose-response curves of everolimus were determined at the end of resistance induction and over time after everolimus withdrawal. Response to ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors OSI-027 and AZD2014, and PI3K-mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 was studied. Gene expression of 10 PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway-related genes was evaluated using quantitative realtime PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: Long-term everolimus-treated BON-1/R and QGP-1/R showed a significant reduction in everolimus sensitivity. During a drug holiday, gradual return of everolimus sensitivity in BON-1/R and QGP-1/R led to complete reversal of resistance after 10-12 weeks. Treatment with AZD2014, OSI-027 and NVP-BEZ235 had an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in both sensitive and resistant cell lines. Gene expression in BON-1/R revealed downregulation of MTOR, RICTOR, RAPTOR, AKT and HIF1A, whereas 4EBP1 was upregulated. In QGP-1/R, a downregulation of HIF1A and an upregulation of ERK2 were observed. Conclusions: Long-term everolimus resistance was induced in two human PNET cell lines. Novel PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathwaytargeting drugs can overcome everolimus resistance. Differential gene expression profiles suggest different mechanisms of everolimus resistance in BON-1 and QGP-1. Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are a diverse group of neoplasms, mainly found in the gastrointestinal tract, lung and pancreas.",

Primary therapy for localised PNET remains surgical excision. However, up to 60% of all patients present with unresectable disease (Halfdanarson et al, 2008). In these patients, systemic treatment has an essential role in controlling the disease (Falconi et al, 2012). The role of traditional cytotoxic therapies in PNET remains a matter of debate, with only small series showing response to streptozocinbased chemotherapy (Calender, 1997;Hansel et al, 2004;Schonhoff et al, 2004). Newer chemotherapy regimens with temozolomide alone (Ekeblad et al, 2007), or in combination with capecitabine (Strosberg et al, 2011), show promise. The low response rate for streptozocin-based chemotherapy and the associated side effects underscore the need for targeted drugs.",

            "text": "The phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) signalling pathway has a major role in NET by regulating cell growth, proliferation, survival and protein synthesis ( Figure 1A). Furthermore, elevated mTOR expression and activity is associated with a higher proliferative capacity and worse prognosis (Missiaglia et al, 2010). Recently, exome sequencing of primary PNET tumour samples revealed mTOR pathway genes to be mutated in 16% of all PNETs, in addition to highlighting mutations in other genes, including MEN1 (44% of all patients), DAXX (25%) and ATRX (18%) (Jiao et al, 2011). mTOR acts as the catalytic subunit of two functionally distinct complexes, named mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) (Capdevila et al, 2011). mTOR proves to be an interesting target for therapy of PNET with mTOR-inhibiting rapamycin and analogues (rapalogues) such as everolimus (RAD001). Rapamycin, everolimus and other rapalogues form a complex with the 12 kD FK506-binding protein FKBP12 (Lach et al, 1999;Helpap and Kollermann, 2001). This rapalogue-FKBP12 complex allosterically inhibits mTOR when it is part of mTORC1. However, rapalogues only have limited effect on mTOR when mTOR is part of mTORC2 because of steric hindrance by the Rictor mTORC2-subunit (Goto et al, 2001). A phase III trial with everolimus was conducted in 410 patients with well-and moderately differentiated PNETs and showed an improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) in the everolimus-treated group compared with the placebo group . Similar results were seen in the phase III trial with sunitinib, a pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Raymond et al, 2011). On the basis of these results everolimus and sunitinib became the first FDA and EMA approved drugs in 30 years for the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic PNETs. However, an objective partial response was only seen in 5% of the patients receiving everolimus or sunitinib. The significant effect on PFS was thus mainly due to disease stabilisation and minor reductions in tumour growth. As PFS in phase III study with everolimus is still limited to 11 months, adaptive resistance to mTOR inhibition with rapalogues was described (Yao et al, 2013). To overcome this resistance, novel PI3K-AKT-mTOR targeting drugs have been developed, such as NVP-BEZ235, OSI-027 and AZD2014. Exploiting the homology between the kinase domain of mTOR and PI3K, NVP-BEZ235 docks in the active pocket of both molecules and reduces kinase activity of PI3K and mTOR by competing with ATP-binding. The selective mTOR inhibitors AZD2014 and OSI-027 target the kinase domain of mTOR, blocking both mTORC1 and mTORC2 in an ATP-competitive manner, without blocking PI3K kinase activity (Maira et al, 2008;Yu et al, 2009). Although the efficacy of novel drugs in PNET cell line model of short-term adaptive resistance to everolimus has been studied (Passacantilli et al, 2014), no data are currently available about long-term adaptive resistance in everolimus-treated PNET. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance to rapalogues is thus necessary for a predictive biomarker for everolimus resistance to be identified.",

Starting from this IC 50 concentration, QGP-1 and BON-1 were continuously cultured in increasing concentrations of everolimus.

After a 7-day-treatment with AZD2014, cell proliferation was significantly less reduced at the 250 nM and 500 nM concentration of AZD2014 in BON-1/R when compared with long-term vehicle-treated BON-1.

A maximal inhibition of 480% of cell proliferation was obtained at 1 mM of AZD2014 in all cell lines tested ( Figure 4A and B).

            "text": "In this study, to the best of our knowledge, the first two PNET models for long-term acquired everolimus resistance were established. Both QGP-1 and BON-1 were cultured during more than 20 weeks in increasing concentrations of everolimus and continued to grow under a 250 and 1000-fold IC 50 growth inhibitory concentration of everolimus, respectively. Corresponding in vivo concentrations are not reachable in patients (O'Donnell et al, 2008). Continued cell growth under these high everolimus concentrations, unreachable in patients, hence indicates an everolimus resistance with possible clinical implications. Both the resulting BON-1/R and QGP-1/R show a significantly decreased response to everolimus in comparison with long-term vehicletreated BON-1 and QGP-1, even in the highest concentrations tested (1 mM). Similar results were seen when comparing BON-1/R and QGP-1/R and its vehicle-treated counterparts for response to rapamycin. This indicates that BON-1/R and QGP-1/R are not only everolimus-resistant, but are also resistant to other rapalogues. A previous study looked at everolimus-resistance in BON-1 (Passacantilli et al, 2014). However, this study treated BON-1 cells during 8 weeks with a dose of 10 nM, which is a much shorter period and a lower dose than used in this study. In addition, the authors did not perform a resistance induction experiment with QGP-1. Given the long duration of treatment, the resulting BON-1/R and QGP-1/R cell lines in our study could be considered as a representative model for rapalogue resistance seen in PNET patients, where median time to treatment failure and, thus, acquired everolimus resistance is 11 months . Various mechanisms have been proposed for the limited response to everolimus in PNET ( Figure 1B). Not all phosphorylation sites of mTORC1 downstream proteins such as p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), growth factor receptor bound protein 10 (GRB10) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) respond to the same extent to allosteric inhibition of mTORC1 by rapalogues (Kang et al, 2013), thereby diminishing rapalogue efficacy. Adaptive resistance may also be caused by induction of activated phosphorylation of AKT. This occurs through the lifting of negative feedback of the mTORC1 downstream p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) on the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (Ohike et al, 2003;O'Reilly et al, 2006;Julien et al, 2010). S6K1 effects this negative-feedback on insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which regulates insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1; O'Reilly et al, 2006). Furthermore, mTORC1 activates GRB10, which negatively regulates IGF-1 signalling. When mTORC1 is inhibited by rapalogues, this negative feedbackloop of IGF-1 is suppressed, synergistically adding to the effect of mTOR inhibition of the S6K1-feedback loop (Emerling and Akcakanat, 2011). As rapalogues effectively block mTORC1 but only have a limited, dose-dependent action on the mTORC2, the effect of rapalogues on mTOR signalling may be circumvented through increased activity of mTORC2 (O'Reilly et al, 2006;Julien et al, 2010). Furthermore, a direct role of S6K1 on mTORC2mediated AKT phosphorylation has been described since S6K1 might be instrumental in the inhibitory phosphorylation of Rictor, the rapalogue-insensitive component of mTORC2 (Julien et al, 2010). Novel mTOR inhibitors, blocking both mTORC1 and mTORC2 by competitively binding the ATP-binding mTOR kinase pocket, have been developed to overcome these escape mechanisms. AZD2014 is an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, currently undergoing phase II evaluation in different tumour types (Pike et al, 2013;Basu et al, 2015a) ( Figure 1C). In our study, AZD2014 effectively reduces cell proliferation both in the everolimus-sensitive QGP-1 and BON-1, as well as in the everolimus-resistant BON-1/R and QGP-1/R. This is the first time that AZD2014 shows efficacy in PNET models. In addition, these results indicate that AZD2014 overcomes everolimus resistance in PNET in concentrations reachable in patients (Basu et al, 2015a). Further development of this drug in PNET could hence benefit PNET patients. In addition, OSI-027, a drug from the same ATPcompetitive mTOR inhibiting class was tested. In contrast with the other tested compounds, the growth inhibitory effect of OSI-027 in ",

            "text": "In a xenograft mouse model, concentrations of up to 2 mM could be reached, but further studies on pharmacokinetics in humans are needed (Bhagwat et al, 2011). Although resistant and sensitive BON-1 responded equally to OSI-027 treatment, only limited efficacy in overcoming everolimus resistance with OSI-027 was observed in the QGP-1 cell line. This difference in response to OSI-027 between BON-1/R and QGP-1/R suggests two distinct molecular mechanisms of resistance. NVP-BEZ235 is a dual blocker of mTOR, blocking both mTORC1 and mTORC2, and the upstream PI3K (Doglioni et al, 1998)  (Figure 1D). NVP-BEZ235 has proven efficacy in in vitro and in vivo PNET models (Doglioni et al, 1998;Paireder et al, 2013). Dual inhibition of the PI3K-mTOR pathway could prevent cross-talk activation of the mitogenactivated kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK-ERK pathway) through PI3K-mediated feedback loop (Helpap and Kollermann, 1999;Carracedo et al, 2008;Zitzmann et al, 2010;Svejda et al, 2011;Paireder et al, 2013). This cross-talk could lead to an escape of mTORC1 inhibition and, hence, to rapalogue resistance. Although NVP-BEZ235 has completed phase II studies, clinical development of this drug might not progress to phase III because of the drug's safety profile (Fazio et al, 2016). However, our current study demonstrates that dual blocking of PI3K and mTOR could be an attractive strategy to overcome long-term acquired everolimus resistance. In addition, maximum inhibition in both resistant and sensitive cell lines was reached with NVP-BEZ235 concentrations more than 10-fold lower than doselimiting plasma concentrations obtained in phase I studies (Bendell et al, 2015). As this is in line with previously reported in vitro results and an in vivo study with lower dose NVP-BEZ235 in a glioblastoma model demonstrated efficacy, it could hence be interesting to evaluate low-dose NVP-BEZ235 in PNET (Maira et al, 2008;Passacantilli et al, 2014). Another possible mechanism for everolimus resistance is tumour heterogeneity. Within-patient and within-tumour heterogeneity in proliferation, genomic alterations and functional imaging characteristics have been demonstrated in neuroendocrine tumour patients (Gebauer et al, 2014;Shi et al, 2015;Basu et al, 2015b). This heterogeneity could be caused by tumoural subclones with different phenotypes and responses to treatement (Marusyk et al, 2014). By treating a patient with everolimus, selection of  everolimus-resistant subclones could occur, leading to resistance. Although short-term everolimus resistance is mainly driven by phosphorylation changes in PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway proteins (O'Reilly et al, 2006), a shift in clonal population could be a driving force in long-term everolimus resistance. This is illustrated by the gradual reversal of everolimus resistance in BON-1/R and QGP-1/R, with a complete return of everolimus sensitivity only after 42 months of culturing without everolimus. If this resistance would only be caused by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins, a faster reversal of everolimus resistance could be expected. Long-term treatment with everolimus might hence select or induce subclones with a different genetic, epigenetic or transcriptional make-up that makes them more resistant to everolimus. Future studies using next generation sequencing would be a good strategy to identify these resistant subclones and yield biomarkers for everolimus resistance. Given the long timeframe of sustained resistance, alterations in gene expression were studied to elucidate possible resistance mechanisms. In BON-1/R, the main components of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 and the important upstream protein AKT were downregulated, whereas effector protein 4EBP1 expression was upregulated, hinting at a compensatory mechanism in which 4EBP1 is less dependent on mTORC1 and mTORC2. On the other hand, the main upregulated gene in QGP-1/R was ERK2, part of the MAPK-ERK pathway, illustrating a possible escape through this pathway. Interestingly, both cell lines seem to have a differential gene expression profile after developing resistance to everolimus. This is corroborated by their different response to novel PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway targeting drugs. QGP-1/R is more resistant to treatment with the two tested ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors, AZD2014 and OSI-027, than BON-1/R. Similarly, although full inhibition of proliferation with NVP-BEZ235 could be reached in both BON-1/R and QGP-1/R, a higher concentration of NVP-BEZ235 is needed to overcome resistance in QGP-1/R. Hence, we could conclude that the underlying mechanisms of everolimus resistance in BON-1/R and QGP-1/R might be different. If our data can be extrapolated to PNET patients, our study could provide an insight in the mechanisms determining resistance to mTOR inhibition in the clinic. Ultimately, this might lead to a better selection of patients and true personalised medicine.",

Both the ATP-competitive mTOR blocker, AZD2014, as the dual PI3K-mTOR blocker NVP-BEZ235 are able to overcome this rapalogue resistance. Further evaluation of both drugs in in vivo and patient studies, targeted at overcoming everolimus resistance, could hence be challenging. In addition, both models allow the study of the detailed mechanisms of acquired resistance in PNET. Expanding these studies with advanced genetic and genomic techniques, such as next generation sequencing, could lead to the identification of biomarkers for everolimus resistance. In addition to MTOR, mTORC1 component RAPTOR and mTORC2 component RICTOR expression was studied. Moreover, gene expression of AKT, encoding the mTOR upstream AKT, S6K1 and 4EBP1, encoding the mTOR downstream p70 ribosomal kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), respectively, was determined. In addition, BCL2, a gene encoding for anti-apoptotic protein B-cell leukaemia 2 (Bcl-2), and HIF1A, encoding the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha protein (HIF-1 alpha) was used to study the overall effect on apoptosis and proliferation in the cell. Finally, expression of ERK1 and ERK2, two components of the MAPK-ERK pathway was determined. Differences were tested using Student's t-test.
