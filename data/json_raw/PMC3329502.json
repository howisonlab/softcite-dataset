In contrast to adult malignancies, where carcinomas predominate, childhood cancers are histologically very diverse. There are 12 major groups including leukemias, lymphomas, brain and spinal tumors, sympathetic nervous system tumors, retinoblastoma, kidney tumors, liver tumors, bone tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, gonadal and germ-cell tumors, epithelial tumors and other unspecified neoplasms. The International Classification of Childhood Cancer is based on morphology and topography. 1 Diagnostic groups are defined in the second edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for Oncology.",

            "text": "We describe monozygotic twins discordant for childhood leukemia and secondary thyroid carcinoma. We used bisulfite pyrosequencing to compare the constitutive promoter methylation of BRCA1 and several other tumor suppressor genes in primary fibroblasts. The affected twin displayed an increased BRCA1 methylation (12%), compared with her sister (3%). Subsequent bisulfite plasmid sequencing demonstrated that 13% (6 of 47) BRCA1 alleles were fully methylated in the affected twin, whereas her sister displayed only single CpG errors without functional implications. This between-twin methylation difference was also found in irradiated fibroblasts and untreated saliva cells. The BRCA1 epimutation may have originated by an early somatic event in the affected twin: approximately 25% of her body cells derived from different embryonic cell lineages carry one epigenetically inactivated BRCA1 allele. This epimutation was associated with reduced basal protein levels and a higher induction of BRCA1 after DNA damage. In addition, we performed a genome-wide microarray analysis of both sisters and found several copy number variations, i.e., heterozygous deletion and reduced expression of the RSPO3 gene in the affected twin. This monozygotic twin pair represents an impressive example of epigenetic somatic mosaicism, suggesting a role for constitutive epimutations, maybe along with de novo genetic alterations in recurrent tumor development. ICD, International Classification of Diseases; MZ, monozygotic; qPCR, quantitative real-time PCR dysregulation of gene expression can also be acquired by epigenetic abnormalities, which are a hallmark of cancer evolution at all stages. 2,3 In contrast to the rest of the genome where most CpGs are methylated, CpG islands in 5' cis-regulatory regions of genes are usually unmethylated. Methylation of these CpG islands during development or disease processes is associated with gene silencing. 4,5 Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by promoter hypermethylation provides an important mechanism for tumor initiation and progression.",

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the methylation patterns of several representative tumor suppressor genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, RAD51C and TP53). One of the studied genes, BRCA1, showed constitutive promoter hypermethylation in normal body cells of the affected twin, but not of the healthy twin. Bisulfite pyrosequencing is a rapid and highly accurate method for epimutation screening. It can exactly (\u00b12%) quantify the methylation of individual CpG sites located in the 30-50 bp 3' from the sequencing primer. 9 Our pyrosequencing assay measures the methylation levels of five adjacent CpG sites in the BRCA1 5' promoter.

The normal range of BRCA1 methylation in blood cells of a large number (>100) of controls was 0-5%. Similar to fibroblasts, saliva DNA of the affected twin showed a much higher BRCA1 methylation (9%) than that of her sister (2%). The normal methylation range in 10 saliva control samples was 2-4%.

MZ twins arise from the same zygote, which then divides into two genetically identical embryos. MZ twins discordant for monogenic disorders are generally thought to represent rare examples of somatic mosaicism due to genetic mutations after the twinning event, which are then propagated to subsets of cells from one twin. Here we report on a pair of MZ twins discordant for recurrent tumor development. Our results suggest that post-zygotic epimutations are another source of somatic mosaicism leading to different disease susceptibility in MZ twins.",

Chemotherapy had to be discontinued because of intolerability. A first relapse of the leukemia occurred in 1984. The second chemotherapy could be completed, but another relapse made bone marrow transplantation from her healthy twin sister necessary. Following bone marrow transplantation at age 7 y she was monitored until 1988. From 1985 until 1990 she received human growth hormone. In 2002 at the age of 25 y, she was diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma (ICD10:C730). She underwent thyroidectomy and since then receives steroid hormone replacement. She was not treated with radiation or radioactive iodine. In 2006 a type 2 diabetes became manifest, but otherwise she is healthy. In 2009 she gave birth to a healthy daughter.

Classic bisulfite plasmid sequencing has the added advantage that it allows one to look at a larger number of CpG sites. Here we analyzed a BRCA1 amplicon with 13 CpG sites including the five sites targeted by the pyrosequencing assay (Fig. 2). Fortyseven clones (individual DNA molecules) were recovered from primary fibroblasts of each twin. Six (13%) clones of the affected twin exhibited epimutations, indicating that most (at least 70%) CpG sites on these DNA molecules were aberrantly methylated, typical for epigenetically silenced alleles. In contrast, all 47 alleles of the healthy twin displayed normal hypomethylated patterns. The BRCA1 epimutation rate was significantly (\u03c7 2 test; p = 0.01) higher in the affected twin, compared with her sister. Both sisters showed approximately 2% stochastic (single CpG) methylation errors: 10 of 531 CpG sites in the affected twin (excluding abnormal alleles) and 14 of 609 in the healthy twin were methylated. Collectively, our results suggest a constitutively increased methylation level at the BRCA1 promoter in normal body cells of the affected twin.

Microarray-based karyotype analyses revealed somatic mosaicism for copy number variations (CNVs) in a number (estimated 10%) of both phenotypically discordant (for Parkinson disease, parkinsonism or Lewy body dementia) and concordant MZ twin pairs. 15 Other molecular karyotype and genome sequence studies could not detect any CNV differences between MZ twins that were discordant for cleft lip palate 16 or multiple sclerosis, 17 suggesting that post-zygotic genomic alterations are at least not a common cause of phenotypic discordance. Several recent studies clearly demonstrated the existence of genome-wide epigenetic healthy twin (z ratio normalized with log10 transformation and z scores) was 0.75 (Fig. 3A), consistent with constitutively reduced expression in the affected twin. ATM expression was slightly increased (1.25) in the affected twin, whereas ACTB (positive control), BRCA2, MLH1, RAD51 and Tp53 all showed comparable protein levels in both twins.

Constitutive epimutations in the DNA mismatch repair gene MLH1 have been identified in a small number of mutation-negative cases of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). 40 In rare familial cases with dominant transmission of mosaic MLH1 methylation, the constitutional epimutation was linked to a single nucleotide variant in the 5' UTR of MLH1. 13 Similarly, constitutional epimutations in the DNA mismatch repair gene MSH2, another rare cause of HNPCC, were linked to 3' end deletions of EPCAM, a gene directly upstream of MSH2. 12 Constitutive epimutations in the DAPK1 gene that predispose to B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia are caused by a point mutation upstream of the DAPK1 promoter. 11 Neither sequencing nor microarray analysis of the 5' cis-regulatory region of BRCA1 revealed any detectable genetic differences between the discordant MZ twin pair studied here. Although we cannot exclude a causative genetic defect elsewhere, our findings are consistent with the view that the affected twin exhibits a true BRCA1 epimutation.",

            "text": "Our study revealed the existence of a constitutive BRCA1 epimutation only in the affected sibling of a MZ twin pair. Compared with her healthy sister, the two-cancer twin showed reduced basal BRCA1 protein levels (in untreated fibroblasts) and a higher induction of protein expression by DNA damage. Upregulation of BRCA1 in irradiated cells of both the affected and the healthy twin was not mediated by demethylation of the BRCA1 promoter. In the affected twin the percentage of aberrantly methylated alleles remained constant (at about 10%) after DNA damage and in the healthy twin the BRCA1 promoter was already completely demethylated in untreated cells. It is well known that the methylation of CpGs in 5' promoters that are usually protected from methylation in somatic tissues can suppress gene expression during development, differentiation and disease processes. 4,5 However, other mechanisms, i.e., gene body methylation, may be more important for regulating the cell-context specific efficiency of transcription. 41 The basal ATM protein levels were also increased in the affected twin, although both twins showed equally low promoter methylation levels (around 1%) of the ATM gene. We speculate that ATM is constitutively upregulated by a compensation mechanism to counterbalance the reduced BRCA1 levels. ATM mediates the cellular DNA damage response. BRCA1 is regulated by an differences between MZ twins. 18,19 Spontaneous epimutations may occur 10-100 times more frequently than somatic DNA mutations. 20,21 This spontaneous epimutation rate can be modified by environmental factors, providing a link between lifestyle and phenotypic differences. [22][23][24] In this light, stochastic and/or environmentally induced epimutations represent a major source of phenotypic variation and discordance for complex diseases between MZ twins. The accumulation of epigenetic differences may also explain the phenotypic divergence of MZ twins, as they age. 18 Here we studied a MZ twin pair discordant for childhood cancer and a second primary cancer. Microarray analysis and qPCR revealed mosaic heterozygous deletions on chromosome 5q22.1 (C5orf13) and 6q22.33 (RSPO3) in the affected twin. C5orf13 encodes an 8 kDa intracytoplasmic protein initially identified in neurons and muscles. 25 It contains a conserved PEST domain, which is important for targeting proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome. R-Spondin family members are modulators of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway which plays a crucial role in cell growth, development and disease pathogenesis. 26 RSPO3 is frequently upregulated in human breast cancers and correlated with several tumor parameters, suggesting that it can function as a breast cancer oncogene. 27 However, RSPO3 was downregulated in normal fibroblasts of the affected twin. Although C5orf13 and RSPO3 haploinsufficiency may contribute to the discordant cancer phenotype, they are unlikely to be the primary cause.",

Germline mutations in BRCA1 are associated with hereditary breast cancer, ovarian cancer and some other malignancies; however, so far they are generally not considered as a risk factor for childhood cancer. 28 Our index patient developed precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 4 y and 8 mo. There are only few data linking BRCA1 to hematologic malignancies. In chronic myeloid leukemia, expression of the BCR-ABL fusion protein leads to posttranscriptional downregulation of BRCA1. 29 One study reported partial hypermethylation and reduced expression of BRCA1 in primary and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, 30 whereas others did not find abnormal BRCA1 methylation in leukemia samples. 7,31 In the MZ twin pair studied here, only one sister exhibited a BRCA1 epimutation in a mosaic state in multiple tissues/ cell types, whereas the unaffected twin did not. This epimutation most likely originated by a methylation error during early embryogenesis after the twinning event. It affects a substantial subset of cells derived from different embryonic cell lineages, resulting in somatic mosaicism. Genome-wide demethylation waves in the early embryo erase most germline methylation patterns, followed by de novo methylation and establishment of somatic methylation patterns. 32 Most constitutive epimutations may occur during this vulnerable time window, where epigenetic genome reprogramming occurs, and represent stochastic and/or environmentally induced errors in the establishment or maintenance of an epigenetic state. 33,34 Similar to our case, discordant 18.8 \u03bcl PCR-grade water and 1 \u03bcl (~100 ng) template DNA.

Preliminary evidence suggests that BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation can also be found in blood cells of a subset of breast cancer patients. 43,44 Collectively, these results suggest that constitutive BRCA1 epimutations occur in normal tissues and may be associated with an increased cancer risk. Our pyrosequencing assay may prove useful for high-throughput screening of larger patient populations.",
