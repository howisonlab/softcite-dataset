Recently we provided experimental evidence that AKU is a secondary serum amyloid A (SAA)-based amyloidosis. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the use of antioxidants to inhibit SAA amyloid and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in AKU. Methods. We adopted a human chondrocytic cell AKU model to evaluate the anti-amyloid capacity of a set of antioxidants that had previously been shown to counteract ochronosis in a serum AKU model. Amyloid presence was evaluated by Congo red staining. Homogentisic acid-induced SAA production and pro-inflammatory cytokine release (overexpressed in AKU patients) were evaluated by ELISA and multiplex systems, respectively. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by means of a fluorescence-based assay. Results. Our AKU model allowed us to prove the efficacy of ascorbic acid combined with N-acetylcysteine, taurine, phytic acid and lipoic acid in significantly inhibiting SAA production, pro-inflammatory cytokine release and membrane lipid peroxidation. Conclusion. All the tested antioxidant compounds were able to reduce the production of amyloid and may be the basis for establishing new therapies for AKU amyloidosis."

This leads to the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA; 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid). HGA oxidizes to benzoquinone acetic acid (BQA), which in turn forms melanin-based polymers, deposited in the connective tissue of various organs, causing a pigmentation known as ochronosis, leading to dramatic tissue degeneration. A severe form of arthropathy is the most common clinical presentation of AKU but patients often suffer from cardiovascular disease (frequent cause of death) and kidney disease as well. There is no effective cure for AKU at the moment and treatment is symptomatic.",

Chondrocytes were pre-incubated for 24 h in culture medium in the absence or presence of various concentrations of antioxidants previously determined by us to be effective in reducing ochronotic pigment formation in a serum model of AKU [3]. Stock solutions of 100 mM ascorbic acid (Asc), N-acetylcysteine (Nac) and taurine (Tau) and a stock solution of 15 mM phytic acid (Phy) were prepared in sterile PBS. Lipoic acid (Lip) (15 mM) was prepared in sterile dimethyl sulphoxide. All the solutions were freshly prepared immediately before use, protected from sunlight and serially diluted with fresh culture medium to obtain the desired final concentrations. For the first screenings, 10 \u00c05 M antioxidants and 0.33 mM HGA (final concentration) were tested; in a second phase we focused our research on Nac + Asc and tested such antioxidants at 10 \u00c06 and 10 \u00c07 M (each) in combination.

Subsequently the selection was inverted to evidence birefringence areas. The number of birefringence pixels was extrapolated and normalized with the total cell number in each field. Finally, based on the ratio birefringent pixels/cells, the percentage of birefringence inhibition of each antioxidant in HGA-treated cells was evaluated.

Although we are the first to show the expression of such pro-inflammatory cytokines under AKU conditions (Figs. 3 and 4) [11], the role of these molecules in other rheumatic diseases, and particularly in cartilage degeneration, has been clearly reported. IL-6 is involved in cartilage degradation and enhances the production of SAA. IL-7 is involved in cartilage destruction not only indirectly via inflammatory cells, but also directly via IL-7R-expressing chondrocytes [14]. Production of IL-8, MCP-1 and MIP-1a by synoviocytes from OA patients has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro [15]. Although in vivo the role of IL-12 is less clear, in vitro studies suggest that IL-12 has a pro-inflammatory function in arthritis. IL-2 induces the secretion of IL-1, TNF-a and TNF-b. Cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-a produced by activated synoviocytes, mononuclear cells or articular cartilage itself significantly upregulate metalloproteinase gene expression and the neutralization of IL-1 and/or TNF-a upregulation of metalloproteinase gene expression appears to be a logical development in the potential medical therapy of OA. IL-17 shows properties similar to those of IL-1b and TNF-a. They induce in vitro the synthesis of  Data are the mean of three independent experiments each performed in triplicate. P < 0.05.",

These observations indicate the possibility that oxidative damage and consequent hyperpermeability in synovial vessels may promote plasma proteins such as SAA to pass through the vessels and deposit in the articular tissues. The low molecular weight of SAA, its high affinity for the extracellular matrix, namely collagen, and its high plasma concentration in AKU may promote such a passage. If this hypothesis is true, redox therapy or strategies aimed at blocking oxidative stimulant formation could be useful in the prevention and treatment of AKU and of the related amyloidosis.

SAA is implicated in rheumatoid inflammatory processes through stimulating chondrocytes to produce IL-6 that in turn is recognized as the main inducer of most acute-phase proteins, including SAA. Therefore SAA-induced IL-6 production may enhance the sustained SAA production in an autocrine manner that perpetuates the rheumatoid inflammation. Here we showed that chondrocytes extracted from AKU patients' cartilage produce high levels of IL-8 and IL-6, suggesting that these ILs could play a role in AKU progression.
