Methods: The experiment was conducted at Biotoxtech according to Good Laboratory Practices. Twenty (20) female and 20 male Spague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups of five 5 female and 5 male animals per group. The rats in the three experimental groups received single intramuscular injections with 0.1-\u3396, 0.5-\u3396 and 1.0-\u3396/animal doses of AIP, Groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively, and the control group, Group 1, received a single intramuscular injection with a 1.0-\u3396 dose of normal saline. Clinical signs were observed and body weight measurements were carried out for 14 days following the injections. At the end of the observation period, hematology, clinical chemistry, histopathological tests and necropsy were performed on the injected parts. Results: No deaths occurred in any of the groups. Also, histopathological tests showed that AIP had no effect on the injected parts in terms of clinical signs, body weight, hematology, clinical chemistry, and necropsy. Conclusions: As a result of single intramuscular-dose tests of the test substance AIP in 4 groups of rats, the lethal dose for both males and females exceeded 1.0 \u3396/animal. Therefore, AIP is a relatively safe pharmacopuncture that can be used for treatment, but further studies should be performed."

            "text": "Pharmacopuncture is a new form of acupuncture treatment combining acupuncture and herbal medicine. With acupuncture being based on the meridian theory and herbal medicine being based on Qi and flavor theory, Pharmacopuncture utilizes both meridian and Qi/flavor theories. Pharmacopuncture is a unique treatment of traditional Korean medicine using needling and herbal medicine based on Qi-flavor theories and acupoint selection based on meridian theories [1]. In addition, eight-principle pharmacopuncture (EPP) is a method of treating disorders by using the founding principles in Korean medicine of Yin/Yang, internal/ external, cold/heat, and deficiency/excess [1].",

The herbs were then placed in the bottom of a flask that was then filled with tertiary distilled water, soaked and boiled. The liquid was collected from the upper part of the distillation apparatus. The pH and the concentration of the extract were measured, followed by filtration, subdivision and sterilization [1]. The pharmacopuncture was made in a sterile laboratory by using steam distillation in a laboratory at the Korean Pharmacopuncture Institute (KPI) according to the following procedure: Cleansing \u2192 Leaching \u2192 Extracting \u2192 Distilling \u2192 Cooling \u2192 pH, NaCl control \u2192 Filtering \u2192 Sterilizing \u2192 Packing [9]. The pharmacopunc-ture was stored in a refrigerator (2-8\u2103). The HPLC (High performance liquid chromatography) Agilent Technologies 1260 infinity equipment was used for the analysis, and the analysis conditions were a column of Capcell Pak C18 (type: UG80 5 \u339b, size: 4.6 \u339c I.D. x 250 \u339c, Shiseido), a 1-\u3396/min flow, a column temperature of 35\u2103, a sample dose of 50 \u3395, and UV 275 \u339a. For the mobile phase condition, solvent A, H2O (5-mM NH4OAc), and solvent B, CAN (5-mM NH4OAc), were used to perform the analysis under gradient conditions in which mobile phase A was changed from 97% to 10% in 40 min. The result of HPLC analysis on AIP under these conditions is shown as a chromatogram in Fig. 1. In that chromatogram, the peak of the 9.0-min section was highest compared to the other peaks, and the ratio of the peak area of the 9.0-min section to the total area was found to be 60%. AIP is expected to contain an aromatic substance, and a qualitative analysis study is deemed necessary to determine the unknown components associated with the peaks detected. Twenty-four (24) male and 24 female rats were purchased from ORIENTBIO INC. The 24 male and the 24 female rats were 5 weeks old with body weights of 121.8~143.4 kg, and 103.8~120.9 kg, respectively. The laboratory conditions were as follows: temperature: 21.0-23.1\u2103, relative humidity: 45.7%-61.5%, 10-15 ventilations/h, lighting cycle of 12 h/day and illuminance of 150-300 Lux. The rats were supplied with food (Teklad Certified Irradiated Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet 2918C) and clean water (tap water of Cheongju filtered with a water sterilizer and irradiated with ultraviolet rays). After 7 days of acclimatization, the weights of the male rats were 183.0-205.6 g, and those of the female rats were 141.9-160.0 g. The 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped by using the criteria of their weights being close to the mean weight. A total of 20 male rats and 20 female rats were distributed into 4 groups with 5 mice of each sex per group. The remaining animals were excluded from the test.",

A clinical chemistry analyzer (7180, HITACHI, Japan) and electrolyte analyzer (AVL9181, Roche, Germany) were used to measure alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Crea), total bilirubin (T-Bili), total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), A/G ratio, total cholesterol (T-chol), triglycerides (TG), phosphorus (P), glucose (Glu), calcium (Ca), chloride (Cl), sodium (Na) and potassium (K). The clinical chemistry test showed no changes caused by the test substance in animals of either sex in any group, except that the total mean protein of G2 females and mean creatinine of G3 females showed statistically significant changes with P < 0.05; however, the result had no toxicological meaning because it was not dose-dependent (Table 7).",

            "text": "Eight-principle pharmacopuncture is effective when organ symptoms are accurately diagnosed and treated with proper herbal medicine. This pharmacopuncture system does not create tolerance, toxicity, or addiction [1]. The amount of pharmacopuncture injection is divided into the amount for each acupoint and the total amount for the entire treatment. The standard amount is 0.1 \u3396 for each acupoint. The amount that is injected is increased gradually: 0.1 \u3396 on each acupoint on the first day, 0.2 \u3396 on the second day, and 0.3 \u3396 to 0.5 \u3396 on the third day. When 0.5 \u3396 has been injected without any side effects and the symptoms had improved, the dosage is no longer increased. However, if the symptoms persist, pharmacopuncture may be injected up to 1.0 \u3396 under careful supervision for possible side effects. If the improvement is weak, then the dosage can be increased to 1.5 \u3396. After that, increases can be made in increments of 0.5 \u3396, depending on the response. The total amount of injection should be between 3.0 \u3396 and 5.0 \u3396. Even if the patient does not show significant improvement, increasing the amount beyond 5.0 \u3396 must be carefully considered [1]. Side effects are possible when more than an adequate 1.",

In this study, an intramuscular-dose toxicity test of AIP was performed by Biotoxtech to evaluate the stability of AIP, which had been manufactured by the KPI according to GLP. The result of single intramuscular-doses of AIP in the 4 groups of rats showed that the approximate lethal dose for both male and female rats exceeded 1.0 \u3396 Therefore, AIP is a relatively safe pharmacopuncture that can be used for treatment, but further studies should be performed in the future.",

As none of the test subjects were affected by injections of up to 1.0 ml of AIP, it can be assumed that levels over 1.0 ml may have a determinant effect. However, if the exact lethal dose is to be established, further studies are needed. Finally, the results clearly show that AIP dosing up to 1.0 ml is safe."
