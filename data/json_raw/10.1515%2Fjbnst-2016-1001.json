Only the data from the German Federal Statistical Office (Wagner 2015) and commercial data collections, such as the ORBIS database from Bureau van Dijk, 1 include similarly wide-ranging information on firms or establishments. The BHP is exceptional in that the data are not collected within a survey but come from an administrative source: the notifications to the German social security system. Every employer has to report every employment relationship subject to social security contributions at least once a year. The gathered data therefore contain information on all the employees concerned from the year 1975 onwards. These notifications also include a unique identifier for every employer, the establishment number, which is assigned by the German Federal Employment Agency (BA). Using this identifier, data obtained from individual employment notifications are aggregated to the establishment level to compile the BHP. The BHP includes the industry and location of the establishments as well as detailed information on the employment structure in terms of gender, age, qualification level, occupation, or average gross wages.",

For the current update, however, more substantial changes in the data preparation procedures and the catalogue of variables have been implemented for several reasons. First, adjustments in the social security notification system have led to modifications in the data reported on occupation, education and part-time work. Second, solutions developed by the IAB to improve the data quality, such as the imputation of earnings above the upper earnings limit and the validation of the information on education and vocational training, have been applied. Third, researchers' requirements and the increase in the individual data volume have been taken into consideration. As a result of this redesign, a new and enhanced BHP version for the years 1975 until 2014 has been created. The data preparation has been modified in certain respects in order to improve suitability for scientific research and may contribute to more comprehensive and precise research findings.",

This procedure has been mandatory for all employees who are liable to contribute to the health, pension and unemployment insurances since 1973 in western Germany and since 1991 in eastern Germany. In 1999, the obligation to report was extended to marginal part-time workers. Employers have to submit notifications at the beginning and end of any employment relationship, once a year for continuous employment, and whenever there are any changes relevant for social security. 3 The notification contains information on the beginning and ending dates of the employment, gross wage, employment status, occupation, education and nationality. Characteristics of the establishment (location and industry classification) can be merged. These individual employment notifications are integrated into the Employee History of the IAB (Besch\u00e4ftigten-Historik -BeH). The current BHP is based on a version of the BeH that comprises information on 1.5 billion employment episodes of 81 million individuals from 1975 until 2014.",

Freelancers and civil servants are not subject to social security contributions and are therefore not included. Additionally, marginal part-time workers were not recorded in the data until 1998. With respect to the aggregate data set at establishment level, these restrictions mean that the data comprise only information on establishments with at least one employee subject to social security, orsince 1999at least one marginal part-time worker. As a result, a certain proportion of the working population and establishments are not observed in the BHP. This proportion is not evenly distributed across regions and industries and varies over time. 4 As far as the industries are concerned, the manufacturing industry (excluding construction) and the private service sector (trade, logistics, warehousing, hospitality, IT and communications, finance, insurance, business services, and property) currently exhibit the 3 Within the employment notification procedure a certain time lag is unavoidable. Although changes in employment relationships have to be reported immediately and existing employment relationships have to be confirmed annually, some notifications actually arrive years later. It can thus be assumed that the number of employees and establishments is underrecorded slightly for the years 2012 and 2013 and that there are larger gaps for 2014. Analyses based on previous years suggest that about two per cent of the employees and three per cent of the establishments are still missing for 2014. 4 In order to determine what share of the total employment in Germany is included in the BHP data, the total number of employees per establishment as of 30 June 2013 is summed up for all establishments in the respective region or industry. These statistics are then compared to annual employment figures for 2013 obtained by the German Federal Statistical Office (Arbeitskreis 'Erwerbst\u00e4tigenrechnung des Bundes und der L\u00e4nder'), which also cover civil servants, the military and the self-employed (including family workers). The varying time reference is assumed to have little impact on the reported shares since seasonality is at a comparatively neutral stage in June, the reference date of the BHP. highest coverage. For these industries, the BHP covers more than 85 % of the total employment. For the construction industry, with its high share of selfemployment, the coverage in the BHP amounts to only 78 %. For the public service, defence and social security, which have a large share of public servants, the coverage is only 69 %. In education, where the overwhelming majority of teachers are public servants, the share is 56 %. The lowest shares are found for agriculture, forestry and fishing (51 %) as well as for private households (41 %) due to their high percentage of self-employment. The coverage may also vary significantly between regions. With respect to the sixteen federal states, coverage is lowest in Berlin (77 %) and the other eastern German states (82 %), and higher on average in western German states (85 %) (see Figure 1). The varying coverage of employment needs to be given careful consideration when drawing statistical inferences.",

Information on earnings in the social security notifications is very precise and valid in general. However, earnings are only reported up to the upper earnings limit for statutory pension insurance contributions. For this reason, approx. 10 % of the data on full-time employees' earnings is censored. This leads to biased results due to aggregation at the establishment level.

Furthermore, from 2011 onwards the employers no longer report qualifications in a combined variable, but split into school education and vocational education and training (see Table 1). Hence no time-consistent information is available for the entire period. In order to provide researchers with time-consistent information on school and vocational education, every combination of values from the new occupation code is assigned to the most suitable value of the combined education and vocational training variable according to the old occupation code. This has no effect on missing values, however. In addition, the quality of the education and training data is improved by means of an imputation procedure using a deterministic replacement rule that was suggested by Fitzenberger et al. (2005Fitzenberger et al. ( , 2006 and enhanced by Kruppe et al. (2014).

As the identification of establishments in the BHP is based on these establishment numbers, the definition of an 'establishment' is specific and may differ from other concepts. It is not possible to distinguish between branch offices with a joint establishment number in the data.

The classification provided helps to distinguish between genuine start-ups and closures and changes in establishment numbers, takeovers or spin-offs.
