Each group elects one delegate who can freely decide on each group member's contribution to the global public goods. Our results show that people mostly vote for delegates who assign equal contributions for every group member. However, in contrast to standard theoretical predictions for our delegation mechanism, unequal contributions across groups drive cooperation down over time, and it decreases efficiency by almost 50% compared to the selfish benchmark. This pattern is not driven by delegates trying to exploit their fellow group members, as indicated by theory. It is driven by conditional cooperation of delegates across groups. Since one of the potential sources of the resulting inefficiency is the polycentric nature of global public goods provision together with other-regarding preferences, we use the term P-inefficiency to describe our finding.

            "text": "The management of global public goods is usually organized on multiple, hierarchical scales. This means that global public goods are often governed through a delegated institution whose officials (representatives) are elected or appointed by national (or regional) provision collectives. As a consequence, there is at least a two-tier or two-level provision organization. Is electoral delegation an effective mechanism in sustaining efficient provision levels of a global public good? Despite its obvious relevance, an empirical assessment of the effectiveness of delegation mechanisms of global public goods provision in the field is difficult due to lack of controlled data. Laboratory experiments based on the public goods game are one possible remedy (see Bernard et al. 2013;Hamman, Weber, and Woon 2011). 1 The straightforward advantage of a provision collective consisting of delegates is that delegates can make efficient use of the resources by taking centralized decisions that keep up coordination within and across societies. Nevertheless, the absence of global authority means that there is a temptation to free ride and that global public goods are likely to be under-provided or not provided at all (e.g., Aronsson and Johansson-Stenman 2014;Barrett 2007;Conceicao 2003;L\u00f6schel and R\u00fcbbelke 2014). Another possible cause for the failure is related to an interesting behavioral dilemma for voters in the selection of their representatives. Is it better to delegate a pro-social representative who strives for cooperation when interacting with representatives from other groups, but runs the risk of being exploited by the latter? Or, is it better to elect an egoistic representative who increases own-group profit by free-riding on other groups' contributions, but who might be inclined to abusing her power at hand by exploiting her fellow group members?",

Notice that the group contribution decision in the real world can also be implicit through a national decision on the distribution of the tax burden or through a decision on the design of the redistributive system of a jurisdiction. The decisions of all representatives of all EU countries determine the total contributions at the EU level. 3 An egoistic representative might be an asset in the interaction on the super-group level because she is not taken advantage of by other representatives, but she might exploit part of her own citizens (the own group members) when financing the contributions to the public good by letting them contribute over-proportionately (and/or free-riding on them).

A laboratory experiment allows us to isolate the incentive effects and should be viewed as a platform for studying cooperation and delegation, complementary to field studies. It enables us to assess cooperative preferences and their impact on elections and public goods provision by delegates at the individual level. 4 More precisely, in our experiment, nine decision makers form a society, and they are divided into three groups of population size 3 each. In the Baseline treatment in the experiment, players in each group have to make simultaneous and 3.

However, some of the variables are, by their very nature, difficult to observe in the field or strongly confounded. independent decisions about how much to contribute to a global public good provided at the level of the nine-person society. The total contributions from all members of the three groups are multiplied by a parameter larger than 1 and are then equally distributed among all players in the groups. The parameter is chosen in a way to induce a linear social dilemma that maximizes the distance between the individually optimal and the socially optimal choices of the group members. In the Delegation treatment, we introduce a Borda count as the election rule for the delegation mechanism. The candidate with the smallest total sum of ranks in each group becomes the delegate for her group for the upcoming three periods of interaction. In the contribution stages of the public goods game in each period, only the three delegates make decisions for each of their three group members. More specifically, they submit a contribution vector for the three members of their groups (including themselves). This vector can induce equal or unequal contributions within a group. Other group members than the delegates remain passive observers of the provision decisions. This design feature captures the fact that delegates are able to maximize their personal gain at the expense of the majority of voters. It can, for instance, be viewed as the potential for corrupt office-holding by the delegate or as \"pork barrel\" politics; but within the logic of the public goods game, it is simply free-riding on the benefits of the public good without contributing oneself. In reality, there are of course limits to such kinds of behavior, but in order to have a clear incentive structure, we maximize the potential for exploitation by the delegate in our experiment."

More specifically, she would force the two other group members to contribute fully and thus free ride on them.

In contrast to standard predictions, the elected delegates avoid exploiting other group members by assigning equal contributions to the three group members, driven either by genuine other-regarding preferences or an opportunistic re-election (reputation) motive. However, despite the existence of other-regarding preferences, we observe that the actual contribution levels in Delegation are significantly below the theoretical benchmark with self-regarding preferences, and they steadily decline over time. 5 In effect, delegates who over-contribute compared to other delegates in the society are less likely to be re-elected. As a consequence, a downward spiral of contribution levels for the global public good sets in. It seems that a combination of (1) delegation based on (re)-election and (2) heterogeneity in other-regarding preferences leads to an inefficiency for which we use the term P-inefficiency, associating it with a global public good's polycentric nature. Our data indicate that both ingredients, the re-election concern, and heterogeneity across different groups in terms of other-regarding preferences, might be necessary for existence of the P-inefficiency.

In their delegation treatments, nine players in a group have to choose a single allocator who decides about the amount of contributions for everyone in the group.

In addition, Oxoby (2013) and Flei\u00df and Palan (2013) find that contributions increase when a randomly selected delegate can choose contribution levels for all group members. 6 The difference between our study and those discussed in the previous paragraph lies in the particular group and society structure naturally caused by global public goods provision. In the existing studies, the delegates act like dictators since they can determine the level of contributions for every person in society without any restrictions. In other words, the public goods provision contains no hierarchical structure. In our setting, however, the decision power of the delegate is confined to her own group. The total level of public goods provision is determined by the simultaneous and independent decisions of the three delegates on behalf of their groups. Hence, not only do they face a redistribution problem within their groups, but they also have to deal with the strategic interactions with other delegates across groups. As a consequence, inefficiency in the public goods provision quickly arises in our setup, in contrast to the setup in Hamman, Weber, and Woon (2011).",

They compare several voting schemes in extracting common pool resources, which share a similar payoff structure as the public goods game. In one of these mechanisms, a randomly chosen player in every period votes, on behalf of her group, on the level of extractions for the entire group. They find that this mechanism is effective in overcoming the tragedy of the commons, since the decisions of the delegate affect the group as a whole. In their setting, the median of all extraction proposals made by the delegates was implemented automatically, making it easier to prevent a group from implementing an extreme 6. There is a growing body of literature that studies the effects of delegating punishment or implicit punishment to a centralized authority and the willingness of groups to do so (see, e.g., Andreoni and Gee 2012; Baldassarri and Grossman 2011; Kosfeld, Okada, and Riedl 2009;Markussen, Putterman, and Tyran 2014;Tan and Xiao 2012). extraction level by construction. In the other mechanism, each player votes for the level of extractions implemented at their own group level in each period. They find that the extraction level is not only higher but also increases over time with this mechanism due to defection by other groups that extract from the common pool. Compared to their study, our study focuses on elected delegates instead of randomly assigned delegates. Data from the elections help us uncover the motives and expectations of players and enable us to assess the preferences of group members with regard to the characteristics of their representatives. Moreover, our study allows the delegates to choose contribution strategies for each member of their own groups without any restrictions throughout their tenures, making exploitation of ordinary group members by the delegates possible.",

The delegate is elected via a Borda count, which is simple to explain, easy to implement, and it allows researchers collecting a complete preference list for the candidates. That is, every member of a group is a voter and ranks the candidates (including herself) in order of individual preferences (with 1 as the most preferable rank).

In case of ties, one of the tied candidates is randomly selected as delegate for her group. When casting their vote, subjects can see the average contributions of the three members within their groups from Part 3 of the experiment as well as the following pieces of information from Part 4 (starting from the vote before period 4 in Part 4 onwards): (1) the ID of the delegate of their group in the previous three periods, (2) the vectors of contributions and earnings of all members in one's own group for the previous three periods, and (3) the average contributions of the two other groups within the super-group in each of the previous three periods.

When the reference group is the nine-person super-group, the weight of each in-group member in the social utility part of the delegate's utility function decreases from 1/2 (two members of the own group taken into account) to 1/8 (all eight members of the super-group taken into account), that is, the weight of each out-group member increases from 0 to 1/8. Intuitively, free-riding on in-group members, who weigh less now, becomes comparatively more attractive, while free-riding on out-group members becomes less attractive, since the disutility from contributing less than them becomes larger. Further, it is possible to show that, depending on the size of the reference group and on the other delegates' inequityaversion parameters, players with sufficiently strong advantageous inequity aversion will be elected as delegates. If none of the candidates is sufficiently inequity-averse, players will vote for themselves, and everybody is equally likely to become the delegate within her group."

However, if we break down the voters based on their contributions in Part 3, the ranking patterns vary substantially. The ranking patterns of the high contribution voters are highly consistent with the election outcomes. Namely, voters assign more favorable ranks to the incumbent delegate (\u03b2 1 ), and less favorable ranks to low contributors in Part 3 (\u03b2 2 ), especially if this low contributor is the incumbent delegate (\u03b2 3 ). Negative ranking consequences for the candidate are, furthermore, due to contributing more than the super-group average (a higher rank to the incumbent captured by \u03b2 5 and a lower rank to other candidates by \u03b2 4 , or by forcing the other two members to contribute more than oneself in the previous periods [a significantly positive effect on the rank to other candidates by \u03b2 8 ]). Interestingly, there is lack of intention to seek for other candidates if the incumbent delegate under-contributes compared to other groups. The ranking patterns for middle-and low-contribution voters are less robust. Their idiosyncratic ranking pattern might cancel out during the aggregation process, leading high-contribution voters to win the election. The only consistent pattern in ranking is that they move away from delegates who exploited the two other group members (\u03b2 8 and \u03b2 9 ).

In Baseline, most super-groups quickly converge to zero contributions after three to four periods of interaction. The dynamics in Delegation is much more heterogeneous. Figure 2 suggests that very few delegates initially start with full cooperation (two groups in D5 and one group in D7). Most of them contribute cautiously (i.e., about half of the group endowment) supposedly to gauge the inclination to cooperate by the other two delegates in the society. The delegates in some super-groups (such as D3, D7 and to a lesser extent D8) manage to coordinate and sustain a certain cooperation level throughout Part 4 (56% for D3, 58% for D7, and 54.4% for D8). Some other super-groups (such as D1, D2, and D4) exhibit a lot of fluctuations and a lower overall cooperation level (36.0% for D1, 31% for D2, and 25% for D4). Only one super-group consistently contributes more than the benchmark based on self-regarding preferences (76.5% for D5). Results from a hierarchical cluster analysis confirm that the contribution dynamics of the eight super-groups can be divided into three categories: successful (D5), failed (D1, D2, D4), and mixed (D3, D6, D7, D8).",

One  common feature of the three failed super-groups is that contributions of some groups fall to a very low level (usually 0) in early periods. In the first three periods, the average contributions of the three failed super-groups are already significantly lower than those in other super-groups (8.75 vs. 13.64, p < .05). Another feature is that failed super-groups exhibit a steady downward sloping trend in contributions, while the more successful super-groups are better at coordinating at a certain positive contribution level. Based on these features, we conjecture that some delegates in failed super-groups attempt to free ride on the other groups in the initial periods, triggering an immediate response to decrease contributions by other group delegates in subsequent periods, which is in contrast to standard theoretical predictions if it happens below the threshold of the 66.7% contribution level."

While the delegates lower contributions for everyone, the magnitude of the decrease is higher for herself than for the other two members within her group. Delegates in other super-groups, on the other hand, treat their fellow group members equally. Second, while delegates in other supergroups increase contributions significantly when they learn that they have under-contributed compared to the others, delegates in failed supergroups are insensitive in this respect. Despite the fact that contribution dynamics differ between failed and other super-groups, there are no systematically different patterns in terms of elections.

If this is true, the failed super-groups might elect relatively more defensive and conservative delegates compared to their successful counterparts. According to Fischbacher and G\u00e4chter (2010), the observed dynamics of contributions in a public goods game could be influenced by heterogeneity in preferences or beliefs. Can we attribute the observed heterogeneity in contribution dynamics in our data to the composition regarding cooperative/ distributive preferences of the players in these super-groups? Table 7 compares cooperative and distributive preferences of members in failed and in other (successful and mixed) super-groups. Indeed, failed super-groups consist of a higher fraction of noncooperators, that is, the average unconditional contribution of their members is lower in both Part 1 and Part 3. A higher percentage of players in those three super-groups are classified as free riders (according to the classification criteria in Fischbacher, G\u00e4chter, and Fehr 2001), and they also fully free ride on the other two members in the one-shot distribution decision in Part 2. Nevertheless, none of the comparisons is statistically significant. While this could be caused by the limited number of observations, it also suggests that the composition in terms of cooperative and distributive preferences alone cannot fully account for super-group heterogeneity in performance.",

Our results suggest that compared to a nonhierarchical situation, electoral delegation significantly increases intergroup cooperation levels. Moreover, the election process effectively prevents voters to be massively exploited by the delegates. Nevertheless, the actual levels of contribution with delegation fall significantly short of the theoretical predictions, under the assumption of selfish preferences. Interestingly, we observe a decrease in cooperation levels over time, in contrast to theoretical predictions based on selfish preferences and on most parameter combinations for inequity-averse preferences. The reason potentially lies in the heterogeneity in cooperative attitudes across groups, combined with a strong motive among voters for equal contributions within the group."

Our data indicate that both ingredients-delegation based on elections (or more generally: reputational concerns) and heterogeneity across different groups in terms of other-regarding preferences-might be necessary for existence of the P-inefficiency. As one of the referees correctly points out, we do not necessarily need heterogeneity in other-regarding preferences. Some noise in the contribution of strongly inequity averse players (for instance, as a consequence of heterogeneous beliefs regarding the cooperation levels of others) can create a coordination problem and, potentially, dwindling contribution levels over time. Such reasoning implies that delegation-how we implemented it-solves the intragroup social dilemma, but not the intergroup social dilemma. Still, the explanation requires some underlying heterogeneity, but not necessarily in preferences."

For our parameters, towards the end of the interaction with delegation, it amounts to almost half of the maximal efficiency level implied by the standard solution. Intuitively, group members neither want to be exploited by their delegates nor by other groups in the society. As a consequence, if the level of contributions across groups is different, we observe a similar, albeit slower, decay of contribution levels as in the standard linear public goods game. With delegation, groups cannot coordinate on the Pareto-optimal outcome, even in a repeated interaction. Interestingly, when levels of cooperation decay over time, there does not seem to be an increase in the number of exploitation instances in which group members are exploited by their delegates. Rather, contribution levels get stuck on low levels."

On the other hand, voters face the risk that such a delegate (leader) may be opportunistic and thus may favor herself or small interest groups at the cost of the majority. Such sorts of dilemmas in selecting the best candidate do not only exist in politics, but also in corporations, organizations, and communities, where the (elected) delegate has some discretionary power over the distribution of benefits and costs. More research in a similar spirit seems warranted as a perquisite for better understanding delegation decisions and leadership."

Albeit oversimplified, this conclusion is consistent with the fact that many self-enforcing international environmental agreements (such as the Kyoto protocol) seem to fail in improving efficiency substantially over the noncooperative outcome in the delegation setting. Other results suggest that a big obstacle to such international cooperation is the lack of effective enforcement and monitoring power at the global level. The P-inefficiency seems to be an additional obstacle that has been overlooked so far. Future work is needed to explore issues such as supra-national linkages to reduce the strategic uncertainty in delegates' interactions (Sandler 1998) and to confirm existence of the P-inefficiency in similar environments, the conditions under which it is relevant, and the external validity of our results. Statements of head of states or envoys like the ones in climate negotiations that explicitly formulate conditional offers for the level of climate gas emission reductions make us confident that our setup is also relevant for the real world, albeit being stylized.",
