Of these, \u03b1-tocopherol is the only isomer related to the vitamin E nutritional requirement. The naturally occurring form of the vitamin is RRR-\u03b1tocopherol (1,2) . Vitamin E is considered one of the best biological antioxidants because of the protection it offers to plasmatic membranes and low density lipoproteins against oxidation and lipid peroxidation reactions (3) .",

According to Debier et al (6) , newborn infants are more susceptible to oxidative damage than adults.

High rates of \u03b1-tocopherol transfer between adipose tissue and plasma lipoproteins were also observed (30) . On this basis, it is supposed that when the body's \u03b1-tocopherol stocks are high there will be a higher concentrations of vitamins in lipoproteins, which in turn may be related to increased transfer of \u03b1-tocopherol to the mammary glands, mediated by lipoproteins.",

Further studies should be conducted to test for an association between gestational body mass index and the concentrations of \u03b1-tocopherol in colostrum and breastmilk and for a relationship between gestational weight gain and vitamin E concentrations.",
