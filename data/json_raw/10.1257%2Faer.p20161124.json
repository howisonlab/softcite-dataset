This article uses new transaction data linked to Census Bureau Data to examine gender differences at critical junctures in the STEM pathway, graduate training, and the early career. We find gender \"separation\" among students-women work on teams with larger shares of women (especially among faculty) than men-but we find no clear disadvantages in the aspects of training environments that we can measure. We find, however, dramatic differences in career outcomes. Women earn 31 percent less than men overall and 11 percent less controlling most notably for field of study and funding source. The gap disappears once we include gender interacted with marital status and children.",

Once a PIK is assigned to a record, the Personally Identifiable Information is removed so analysts can anonymously link individuals across files for statistical and research purposes. Person records in the census contain date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, and relationship to the head of household (HH), the last of which permits inference about certain relationships within a household. Marital status is modeled for graduate students who are either the HH or listed as a spouse or unmarried partner of the HH. Individuals are characterized as having children when they are, or are married to, the HH and there are (step) children of the HH present. 1 The PIK is used to link to W-2 earnings, which cover total annual wages, tips, and other compensation from the job with the highest earnings in each year from 2005 and 2012.

There are clear differences in field of study-59 percent of the females in our sample completed dissertations in biology, chemistry, or health, but only 27 percent of males wrote dissertations in those fields. Males were more than twice as likely to complete dissertations in engineering (45 percent versus 21 percent) and were 1.5 times as likely to study computer science, math, or physics (28 percent versus 19 percent).

The remaining columns report the gender gaps conditional on the controls discussed above. Dependent variables enter as rows. There is substantial gender separation in teams. For the average female graduate student in the data, over two out of ten faculty members on the research teams are female, while fewer than one out of ten faculty members are female for the average male graduate student. This finding is robust; even using the richest set of controls in column 6, there is a precise 5 percentage point difference in the proportion of faculty members on the research team who are female. There is some evidence female graduate students work on teams with a higher percentage of other female students, but this result disappears controlling for dissertation topic. These differences could be due to choice (\"sorting\"), external forces (\"segregation\"), or a combination of both. Furthermore, since students are observed at a relatively late stage in their education, sorting by choice at this stage may derive from experiences (including segregation) at earlier stages.

For example, female graduate students tend to be on awards with smaller teams and a greater share of faculty per graduate student. This may imply more opportunities for direct mentorship, but it also may reflect differences in the size and prestige of grants (i.e., smaller awards may not be able to employ as many graduate students). Female graduate students are employed on fewer federal research awards overall than their male counterparts, spend slightly less time participating in their primary award, and have shorter spans between first appearing in the UMETRICS data and graduating, although many of these differences are sensitive to the specification. These differences could be interpreted two ways. In one view, the tendency of females to participate in fewer awards and appear in the data for shorter durations could reflect specialized training and faster degree completion. In another view, female students may be isolated from other researchers and may begin participating in federally funded research later. More research is needed to determine which view is correct.",

Panel A shows women are more concentrated than men at the low-to-middle portion of the earnings distribution and less represented at the higher end of the earnings distribution, with the male earnings distribution being bimodal. Panel B shows relatively smaller gaps among those going into academia and government, with many earning typical postdoctoral researcher incomes just under $50,000. Women and men earn the most in industry, but the gap is also larger. Table 2 further analyzes differences in early labor market outcomes. Column 1 of the top row shows that the female students in our graduating cohort are 13 percentage points less likely than male graduate students to work in the lucrative sectors outside academia and government. This holds controlling for university, degree year, and demographic characteristics, but column 4 shows there are no detectable differences once we control for broad dissertation topic and funding source. We find unconditional wage differences between males and females of 0.37 log points (31 percent). Controlling for university characteristics, degree date, and demographics has little impact on the point estimate. However, we see the magnitude of the estimated wage gap drop by about two-thirds to 11 percent when we include controls for dissertation topic and funding source, underscoring the important role of field of study. 5 Adding controls for family and household structure (column 5) does not change the point estimate, which is significant at the 10 percent level. Allowing the impact of partnership status and children to vary by gender, however, makes the point estimate of the male-female wage gap statistically indistinguishable from zero. This suggests the presence of children contributes meaningfully to the gender wage gap. However the point estimates on the interactions themselves are imprecise, possibly due to noise in measurement of children and partnered status (see footnote 2).
