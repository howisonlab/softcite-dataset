            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope protein 2 (E2) is involved in viral binding to host cells. The aim of this work was to produce recombinant E2B and E2Y HCV proteins in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, respectively, and to study their interactions with low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) and CD81 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the ECV304 bladder carcinoma cell line. To investigate the effects of human LDL and differences in protein structure (glycosylated or not) on binding efficiency, the recombinant proteins were either associated or not associated with lipoproteins before being assayed. The immunoreactivity of the recombinant proteins was analysed using pooled serum samples that were either positive or negative for hepatitis C. The cells were immunophenotyped by LDLr and CD81 using flow cytometry. Binding and binding inhibition assays were performed in the presence of LDL, foetal bovine serum (FCS) and specific antibodies. The results revealed that binding was reduced in the absence of FCS, but that the addition of human LDL rescued and increased binding capacity. In HUVEC cells, the use of antibodies to block LDLr led to a significant reduction in the binding of E2B and E2Y. CD81 antibodies did not affect E2B and E2Y binding. In ECV304 cells, blocking LDLr and CD81 produced similar effects, but they were not as marked as those that were observed in HUVEC cells. In conclusion, recombinant HCV E2 is dependent on LDL for its ability to bind to LDLr in HUVEC and ECV304 cells. These findings are relevant because E2 acts to anchor HCV to host cells; therefore, high blood levels of LDL could enhance viral infectivity in chronic hepatitis C patients.",

After synthesis, the E2 protein undergoes a process of post-translational modification and presents nine to 11 potential glycosylation sites, which differ depending on virus genotype and subtype, but are nevertheless well conserved and are therefore good antigenic targets for developing antiviral molecules (Liu et al. 2001). E1 and E2 proteins perform essential functions during different stages of the HCV replication cycle and are necessary for initiation of the infection process; their functions include receptor binding, fusion with the host cell membrane and invasion (Bartenschlager & Lohmann 2000, Dubuisson et al. 2008.",

            "text": "The mechanism through which HCV invades a cell is not well known, but there is strong evidence that viral proteins interact with cell surface receptors. For instance, the interactions of HCV with glycosaminoglycans (Germi at al. 2002), the liver/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecules-3-grabbing non-integrin (SIGN) (Lozach et al. 2003) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) (Agnello et al. 1999) are thought to facilitate initial viral attachment to the cell. Subsequently, HCV can form interactions with tetraspanin CD81 (TAPA-1) (Zhang et al. 2004), scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-BI) (Scarselli et al. 2002), dendritic cell-SIGN (Lozach et al. 2003), the tight junction proteins claudin-1 (CLDN1) (Evans et al. 2007) and occludin (OCLN) (Ploss et al. 2009), signal transducer Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologs (Zona et al. 2014), the cholesterol uptake receptor Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (Sainz et al. 2012) and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) (Martin & Uprichard 2013). Additionally, epidermal growth factor receptor and ephrin receptor A2 tyrosine kinases have been identified as HCV entry cofactors (Lupberger et al. 2011). Although data from several studies support the involvement of LDLr in HCV entry, several discrepancies remain. A study con-ducted by Albecka et al. (2012) investigated the role of LDLr in the HCV life cycle by comparing virus entry to a process of lipoprotein uptake and showed that HCV particles can interact with LDLr. However, this interaction does not necessarily lead to a productive infection, but rather indicates a role for LDLr as a lipid-providing receptor, which modulates viral RNA replication.",

As this pathology is associated with major complications and prognostic implications, the necessity of acquiring a more detailed characterisation of the interactions between HCV and cells during infection is required. Previous studies using hepatoma cell lines, lymphocyte cell lines and nonhuman cell lines have already demonstrated that the E2 protein can bind to these cells. In the current study, we tested E2 binding to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and ECV304 cells, both of which are endothelial cell models. Therefore, we aimed to study the binding interactions between recombinant E2 proteins and LDLr and CD81, two well known binding partners of E2, in two different endothelial cell lines: HUVEC, which have a high concentration of LDLr but no CD81 receptors, and ECV304 cells, which are a derivative of the human urinary bladder carcinoma T24 cell line and possess a high concentration of LDLr and a low concentration of CD81. To investigate how human LDL and differences in protein structure (glycosylated or not) affected binding efficiency, we examined recombinant proteins that were either associated or not associated with lipoproteins.",

Inhibiting recombinant E2 proteins from binding to cell receptors -In HUVEC, blocking LDLr led to a significant reduction in E2B and E29 binding both in the presence and absence of FCS and/or LDL in the media (Fig. 6). Blocking the CD81 receptor produced a markedly different result, as both the binding and the effects produced by FCS and/or LDL were similar to the results that were obtained in experiments that did not include the CD81 inhibitory antibody (Fig. 7). In another set of experiments, both LDLr and CD81 receptors were blocked and only a small amount of fluorescence was detected ( Fig. 8), suggesting that these proteins might be binding to other receptors that are also able to bind E2 proteins, such as SR-BI, CLDN1, OCLN and TfR1. We also cannot rule out the possibility that LDL might modify E2 (e.g., conformation) and alter its interactions with CD81 or other cellular receptors in the absence of LDLr. Nevertheless, these results suggest that E2 proteins primarily bound to LDLr and not to another cell receptor. In ECV304 cells, blocking LDLr also led to a decrease in the binding of both recombinant proteins under all of the experimental conditions that were tested. However, this effect was not as intense as that which was observed in HUVEC. In Fig. 9, it can be observed that blocking LDLr could not completely eliminate binding. This may indicate that both CD81 and other E2 receptors that are present in this cell line, such as SR-BI, CLDN1, OCLN and TfR1, represent alternative binding sites, which may be more relevant in the context of E2Y than E2B. When blocking CD81, a small but significant decrease in binding capacity was also observed under all of the experimental conditions that were tested in ECV304 cells (Fig.  10). These results confirm that CD81 is also relevant to the binding of E2 recombinant proteins to ECV304 cells and they differ from what was observed in HUVEC, which were practically insensitive to blockage of this receptor. Finally, the simultaneous blockage of both receptors (Fig.  11) reduced the binding of E2 proteins to ECV304 cells, similarly to what was observed in HUVECs.    ",

Moreover, LDL and CD81 receptors are believed to mediate this process (Scarselli et al. 2002, Voisset & Dubuisson 2004. The absence of significant fluorescence that was noted with respect to CD81 is an indication that this receptor is not constitutively expressed in HUVEC under physiological conditions. Consistent with this, the expression of CD81 has previously been found to be reduced in endothelial cells in the absence of inflammation (Rohlena et al. 2009). In ECV304 cells, fluorescence was low but significant, which is an indication that the CD81 receptor was expressed. This result can be explained by the fact that ECV304 is a hybrid cell line that was created from endothelial cells that were contaminated with epithelial cells from bladder carcinoma (T24/83) (Brown et al. 2000). We believe that this might explain the very low but constitutive expression of CD81 in this cell line. However, we cannot rule out that the low percentage of ECV304 cells expressing CD81 may be related to a particular cell cycle phase.",

Altogether, these results suggest that LDLr is the primary target of both proteins under conditions in which they are associated with LDL. In agreement with these findings, CD81-deficient cells have previously been demonstrated to internalise HCV after it binds to LDL and uses LDLr (Agnello et al. 1999). Additionally, LDLr-deficient cells are less susceptive to HCV infection (Hishiki et al. 2010). Indeed, LDLr has long been considered HCV's route of entry into host cells (W\u00fcnschmann et al. 2000, Seipp et al. 1997. LDLr has also been shown to be relevant for the cell entry of various members of the Flavivirus genus (W\u00fcnschmann et al. 2000).",

The primary difference between these two proteins is the glycosylation of E2Y. These results are in agreement with previous reports in which glycosylation was found to be indispensable for the global folding and conformation of this viral envelope protein (Goffard & Dubuisson 2003, Voisset & Dubuisson 2004, Bian et al. 2009, Lin et al. 2009. Moreover, glycosylation is also important for the ability of E2Y to bind to LDL and to other receptors of host cells, thereby enabling the coupling and entry of HCV into cells (Dubuisson & Rice 1996, Goffard et al. 2005, Tello et al. 2010. A previous report by Yurkova et al. (2004) found that glycosylation was not important for the binding of E2 to CD81. This finding was not corroborated by our experiments, as we found that E2Y more efficiently bound to both CD81 and LDLr than did E2B.",

This may be related to the initial inflammation that is caused by HCV in endothelial cells of the hepatic portal vein, which may contribute to HCV-mediated cirrhosis.",

            "text": "This finding is very relevant because E2 serves as an anchor protein during the binding of HCV to host cells and high blood levels of LDL might enhance viral infectivity in chronic hepatitis C patients. In fact, LDL has been shown to promote an increase in HCV infectivity in several previous studies (Lavillette et al. 2005, Meunier et al. 2005, Nahmias et al. 2006, Siagris et al. 2006, Hishiki et al. 2010. The glycosylation of E2 is of critical importance for enabling the virus to anchor to LDLr. Additionally, although many studies have indicated that the E1E2 heterodimer is necessary for viral association with host cell receptors, we demonstrated here that the E2 protein is able to independently bind to these receptors. Finally, the putative mechanism of cellular infection involving E2, LDL, CD81 and LDLr could offer potential new targets for the development of novel antiviral therapies. Moreover, controlling serum LDL levels might also be helpful for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.",
