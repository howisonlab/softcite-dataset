PFL policies may be especially important for new parents, who often struggle to balance competing work and family responsibilities. Parents with access to PFL can stay home to care for and bond with their new children, and then return to work with minimal career interruptions. But despite the importance of these benefits, the United States is one of just a handful of countries without a national PFL policy. The Unites States offers 12 weeks of unpaid leave to some (but not all) workers through the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). 1 However, three recent state-level PFL programs in California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island supply nearly all workers with access to PFL, and similar programs in New York and the District of Columbia will take effect in 2018 and 2020, respectively.",

Understanding how PFL policies specifically affect fathers is important because they may respond to such policies differently from mothers for at least two reasons. First, despite some convergence in earnings between men and women over the last several decades, fathers continue to be the main breadwinners in many U.S. families. 4 Thus, the financial shock to the family associated with only partial wage replacement and a lack of job protection during leave (as in CA-PFL) may be more consequential when fathers take leave than when mothers do. Second, new fathers have less biological need for leave than new mothers, who need time off from work to recover from childbirth and establish breastfeeding.",

            "text": "Fathers' access to paid leave on the private market is very low. For instance, a 2012 report indicates that only 14 percent of U.S. employers offer paid paternity leave to most or all of their male employees (Klerman, Daley, & Pozniak, 2012). As a consequence, new fathers tend to take very little time off work when their children are born. In 2013, less than 2 percent of employed fathers of children under the age of one reported being on leave (vs. 14 percent of employed mothers), and these rates have remained very stable over the last decade. 5 Even in California, where both mothers and fathers are covered by PFL, a large majority of parental leave claims have been made by mothers. However, paternal take-up has increased substantially over the first decade of the policy. In 2005, only 19.6 percent of all CA-PFL claims were filed by men. By 2013, fathers were responsible for about 30 percent of claims. Low rates of paternal leave-taking make analysis of PFL among fathers difficult because most data sets lack sufficient numbers of fathers who are on leave to produce reliable estimates of program effects. To address this issue, we use data from the 2000 Census and the 2000 to 2013 waves of the American Community Survey (ACS), together with difference-in-difference (DD) and difference-in-differencein-difference (DDD) methods, to identify the causal effects of CA-PFL on paternal leave-taking. Our preferred DDD specification compares employed fathers of infants in California to employed fathers of children aged 1 to 3, relative to corresponding fathers of the same age children in other states, before and after the introduction of CA-PFL. We perform an analogous analysis of mothers to enable comparisons of effects across parental gender within the same data set. In dual-earner households, we also separately examine impacts on joint leave-taking-where both parents are simultaneously on leave-vs. \"father-only\" or \"mother-only\" leave-taking while the other parent is at work, or \"either parent\" leave-taking (i.e., either the mother or the father is on leave). Further, our relatively large sample sizes enable us to examine heterogeneity in the program's effects by birth order, child gender, and family income.",

Among households with two married and employed parents, about half of this increase is driven by fathers taking leave at the same time as the child's mother and the other half by fathers who take leave on their own, while the mother is at work. The 2 percent baseline leave-taking rate is consistent with fathers taking about one week of leave on average after their child's birth, and CA-PFL increases that amount to nearly 1.5 weeks. 6 We also find some heterogeneity in parental leave-taking by birth order-the effects on leave-taking are almost entirely driven by fathers of first-born children (i.e., those with no other siblings in the household), while the corresponding differences for mothers are much smaller. We do not find robust statistically significant evidence of heterogeneity in leave-taking effects along the other dimensions that we consider (child gender and family income). The lack of significant heterogeneity by income suggests that the policy is relatively neutral with regard to distributional implications, and that our results from California may be generalizable to other states that are considering similar PFL programs but have different income distributions.",

Our paper makes four contributions relative to Baum and Ruhm. First, our analysis is able to confirm Baum and Ruhm's main finding for fathers-a two to three day increase in leave-taking-using a much larger and more representative data set. Second, the larger sample size in our study permits us to examine new forms of heterogeneity in the effects of CA-PFL on paternal leavetaking. 7 Third, we provide novel insights into simultaneous vs. separate leave use within households with two employed parents. Fourth, we address a critical issue affecting inference in the DD and DDD analyses commonly used in the literature on CA-PFL (including Baum & Ruhm, 2016;Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2013). These studies have a small number of treated groups (most often, just one) and variation in the number of observations per group, making standard errors clustered at the group level unsuitable (Bertrand, Duflo, & Mullainathan, 2004;Donald & Lang, 2007;Ferman & Pinto, 2016;MacKinnon & Webb, 2017). Here, we explicitly examine the sensitivity of our estimates to alternative inference methods accounting for both the small number of treatment groups and heteroskedasticity in the error structure.",

Finally, CA-PFL is a gender-neutral program where eligible parents are entitled to take the same amount of leave, either simultaneously or separately. In contrast, parental leave in many European countries is allocated at the household level and parents must decide how to share it.",

Although we hypothesize that father's leave-taking should increase as a result of the policy, we expect that the effect size may be smaller than it is for mothers. 11 Because a newborn places higher biological demands on mothers, and fathers are on average higher earners, mothers may experience larger absolute increases in leave-taking than fathers. On the other hand, fathers may have larger relative increases in leave-taking because their baseline leave-taking rates are substantially lower than those of mothers and they are less likely to have access to employer-provided PFL.",

CA-PFL may increase joint leave-taking if it encourages fathers to take additional time off around the birth, rather than later in the year after the mother has returned to work. But CA-PFL gives parents access to six weeks of leave that can be used anytime during the first year of the child's life, and does not have to be used all at once.

We hypothesize that the effects of CA-PFL will be larger for parents of first-born than later-born children. Substantial \"start-up\" costs are associated with having a family-both mothers and fathers must adjust to becoming a parent, and they are also typically less experienced in newborn care and may not yet have any child care arrangements when their first child is born (Cowan & Cowan, 2000;Waldfogel, 2006).

At least two explanations are there for this phenomenon. First, it may be that fathers get more utility from spending time at home with sons rather than daughters. Second, they may perceive that paternal time spent caring for boys is relatively more productive than time spent caring for girls. While we cannot distinguish between these two channels in our data, the latter explanation seems less plausible given that it is unlikely that fathers have a relative advantage in caring for boys around the time of birth.",

Fathers in higherincome families are more likely to have access to employer-provided paid paternity leave, however, and face a higher opportunity cost of taking leave (Klerman, Daley, & Pozniak, 2012). This may mean that they have less demand for governmentprovided PFL than men in lower-income families. In fact, research on the effects of CA-PFL on mothers finds that the largest effects on leave-taking are concentrated among the least advantaged mothers (Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2013).",

The ACS is conducted throughout the year and samples 1 percent of the population in most years; thus, it has the major advantage of providing the large samples needed to examine leave-taking behavior among fathers. 13 When weighted, the ACS is a nationally representative survey that provides information about labor market experiences and demographic factors. For our purposes, what is particularly important is that individuals are questioned about their labor market status in the week prior to the survey-referred to as the \"survey reference week\"-allowing us to identify leave-taking during that week. Although the ACS does not ask about parental leave vs. other specific types of leave, it does identify individuals who are temporarily absent from work during that week. The main dependent variable that we examine below is whether the father (or mother) is on leave from work in the survey reference week. This absence could be for many reasons including parental leave, vacation, or illness. 14 This lack of specificity is not 12 We adjust family income to account for the number of adults and children in the household. This adjustment is explained below in the fifth section. 13 Data come from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) database (Ruggles et al., 2010). The ACS started in 2000, and was only a 0.13 percent sample in that year. For the next four years, it was approximately a 0.5 percent sample of the population. The questions used in this study are very comparable in the ACS and the 2000 long-form Census. This analysis combines the 2000 ACS with the 1 percent 2000 Census sample in order to increase the sample size in that year. We also show that our main results are robust to dropping the 2000 data. 14 Specifically, the question asked is: \"LAST WEEK, was this person TEMPORARILY absent from a job or business?\" Respondents can answer \"Yes, on vacation, temporary illness, labor dispute, and so forth.\" or \"No.\" The Current Population Survey (CPS) asks about maternity and paternity leave specifically and is used to identify the effect of CA-PFL on mothers' leave-taking in Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, and Waldfogel (2013). However, the sample of fathers on leave in California in the CPS is too small to produce meaningful estimates. a problem for our analysis because we are interested in any type of leave taken by a father of an infant, regardless of whether it is called parental leave, vacation leave, sick leave, or something else.",

            "text": "As detailed below, our empirical strategy focuses on whether leave-taking of any kind increases more among fathers of infants in California post-law than it does for the comparison groups. The use of appropriate control groups nets out changes in other types of leave-taking that may have occurred for reasons unrelated to the PFL law. Unfortunately, the survey does not inquire about the length of the temporary work absence, so we do not know whether it lasted longer than the survey reference week. 15 In addition to not specifying the length of leave, there are two other limitations of the ACS data. First, fathers can only be linked to children who live in the same household. The analysis therefore excludes fathers who do not live with their children. 16 Assuming that non-resident fathers are less involved with their children than resident fathers, our results will overstate the increase in leave-taking for the average new father (including those not living with their infants). Second, the ACS lacks precise information on children's birth dates, and only reports the age of the child in years. Although CA-PFL can be used at any time in the first 12 months of the child's life, as noted above, most fathers take only brief leaves that occur soon after the birth (Baum & Ruhm, 2016). Since we observe leave-taking in only a single week, we will therefore miss most of these leaves. 17 However, under the assumptions that births and the average length of leave are both approximately uniformly distributed throughout the year, the percentage change in leave-taking estimated to result from the policy will be accurately captured, although the levels will be understated. 18 The analysis sample is limited to fathers who are 16 to 54 years old and employed in the survey reference week. We condition on employment because those who are not employed are less likely to be eligible for PFL and because we will not observe them as leave-takers in the ACS. 19 However, we show below in the sixth section that the results are robust to including all fathers in the analysis, regardless of employment status. We also demonstrate that CA-PFL does not affect the probability that fathers of infants are employed, which is unsurprising given the short amount of paid leave available. We do not observe CA-PFL eligibility status directly, and so our estimation procedure treats all employed fathers in California as eligible for paid leave if their youngest own child in the household is less than 1-year-old. To the extent this assumption is incorrect (e.g., some fathers working in the public 15 The ACS question about temporary work absences should only be answered by individuals who report not working at all during the survey reference week, and so therefore should only capture work absences that last at least a full week. Our results are likely underestimated if CA-PFL increases partial-week leave-taking. Data on hours of work during the survey reference week are not available in the ACS, so we cannot examine this. Another limitation is that the ACS does not distinguish between paid and unpaid leave. 16 In our data, 74.5 percent of infants are identified as living with their biological father (more specifically, 67 percent live with both parents, while 7.5 percent live with only their father). 88 percent of infants are identified as living with their mother. 17 Both of these limitations also apply to mothers, but to a lesser extent, since most children in single parent households live with mothers, and mothers typically take much longer leaves than fathers. 18 We checked the validity of the assumption that U.S. births are uniformly distributed throughout the year using 2011 birth record data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Vital Statistics. The shortest month, February, had the lowest number of births in 2011 (7.5 percent). April had the second lowest number of births (7.9 percent). August had the most births (9.1 percent). The ACS does not contain information about the month of the survey, so we cannot measure the timing of leave relative to birth even under these assumptions.",

A substantially higher fraction has less than a high school education and are not citizens, although mean household income (in 2010 dollars) is somewhat higher.

The dummy variable Treat ist is equal to one for California fathers of infants and Post t is an indicator equal to one if the individual is surveyed in 2005 or later. 22 The vector X ist contains the following individual-level indicator variables: father's age in bins (less than 20, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 to 49, and 50 to 54), race or ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, other race), education categories (less than high school, high school, some college, four-year degree or more), marital status, citizenship status, the age of the youngest child in the household in years, and the total number of children in the household. We also include the following state-year controls in vector C st to account for labor market conditions and other state-specific factors affecting the decision to work: unemployment rate, average welfare benefit for a four-person family, poverty rate, state minimum wage, per capita income, the log of the population, and an indicator for whether or not the governor is Democratic. 23 State and year fixed effects are captured by \u03b4 s and \u03c6 t , respectively, with the Post t main effect being subsumed into the time fixed effects. The coefficient of interest, \u03b2 2 , is the DD estimate of the effect of CA-PFL on fathers' leave-taking in California. We estimate equation 1as a linear probability model, but results are very similar when instead estimating a probit model. These results are available upon request. The DD estimate in equation 1will be biased if trends in leave-taking rates between the treatment and control groups would have been different in the absence of CA-PFL. Although this assumption is fundamentally untestable, we explore the robustness of our results to the use of several alternative comparison groups. First, we compare California fathers of infants to corresponding fathers in other states. 24 The key identification assumption is that of common trends in leave-taking for fathers of infants in California and in other states (in the absence of the policy). This assumption could be violated if there are differential changes in the rate of types of leave-taking that are unrelated to CA-PFL (e.g., vacation or sick days). However, as long as any such changes are not specific to fathers of infants, this concern can be 22 CA-PFL started paying out benefits in July 2004. Because only survey year and age in years can be identified in the ACS, a reported infant in 2004 may have been born as early as January 2003. Assuming births and survey responses are both approximately uniformly distributed throughout the year, only around 12.5 percent of surveyed infants in 2004 would have been born after the implementation of CA-PFL, compared with 87.5 percent of surveyed infants in 2005. Therefore, we treat 2005 as the first year of the policy. 23 The state-year controls come from the University of Kentucky Poverty Research Center National Welfare Data. 24 Individuals from New Jersey are excluded from the analysis because the state implemented its own PFL policy in 2008. Ideally, we would use New Jersey as another treatment state. However, sample sizes of fathers on leave in New Jersey are too small (between four and 20 per year on leave) to produce meaningful estimates. Rhode Island is the only other state to have also started a PFL program, but it did so in 2014, after our sample ends. addressed instead by comparing California fathers of infants to California fathers of youngest children aged 1 to 3 (or 2 to 4) at the survey date. 25 Fathers of older children in California are not eligible to receive paternity leave benefits under CA-PFL, and therefore will serve as a second control group. Interpreting the resulting treatment effect as causal requires the assumption that rates of leave-taking in California are not differentially changing among fathers of infants and of slightly older children for reasons unrelated to CA-PFL. 26 These two sets of control groups can be combined into a DDD model that compares fathers with infants to fathers of older children, in California vs. other states, before and after the policy. This DDD specification allows for differential trends in leavetaking across states and by age of youngest child as long as the difference in the rate of change between fathers of infants and older children in California would have been the same as that in other states in the absence of CA-PFL. Under this assumption, we estimate the DDD equation:",

            "text": "Typically, studies that exploit policy variation across states conduct inference using standard errors clustered at the state level. However, this approach may be challenging in cases where the number of treated clusters is small (Bertrand, Duflo, & Mullainathan, 2004;Donald & Lang, 2007). Other inference methods developed to improve upon cluster robust standard errors when either the number of groups is small or there is cluster heterogeneity do not perform well when the proportion of treated groups approaches zero or one, as is true in this setting (MacKinnon & Webb, 2017). Moreover, recent work suggests that inference methods should account for the fact that there may be variation in the number of observations per group (Ferman & Pinto, 2016). As such, we explore the sensitivity of our results to alternative inference approaches. Specifically, for both the DDD models and the DD specifications where we compare fathers in California to fathers in other states, we first present results from specifications with standard errors clustered at the state level. 27 In addition, we implement a new method of inference developed by Ferman and Pinto (2016) (hereafter, F-P) that provides an improvement in hypothesis testing for situations where there are few treated groups and many control groups in the presence of heteroskedasticity. Heteroskedastic errors are particularly likely in state-level DD and DDD models, where there is substantial variation in the number of observations used to calculate each group-time average. However, several common methods of inference, including cluster-residual bootstrapping (Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller, 2008), the Donald and Lang (2007) two-step approach, and the Conley and Taber (2011) method, all rely on a critical homoskedasticity assumption. The F-P method is an extension of the cluster-residual bootstrap with a heteroskedasticity correction applied to the residuals. F-P develop their method in a standard DD setting, and we extend it to the DDD case (see Appendix B for more details). 28 We follow F-P and assume that the heteroskedasticity is generated by the variation in group size, and present p-values calculated using this method for all results. Finally, we also present results from DD models that use the Donald and Lang (2007) two-step approach to conduct inference.",

Given the relatively modest benefit available (up to 55 percent of wages for up to six weeks), this finding is not surprising. We also show that the policy is uncorrelated with other paternal demographic characteristics, including age, marital status, education, share of fathers who are non-Hispanic white, and share of fathers who are from an under-represented minority (URM) group, which includes Blacks, Hispanics, and other non-White, non-Asian races. Finally, in the last column, we show results when \"predicted leave-taking\"-generated using a large set of fathers' demographic characteristics and their interactions-serves as the outcome. 31 These findings suggest that CA-PFL is uncorrelated with paternal demographics that predict leave-taking behavior. Therefore, it is unlikely that differential demographic trends among fathers of infants in California drive the results shown in the next section. Table 2 shows the estimated effect of CA-PFL on parents' leave-taking behavior in California. The first six columns show results for fathers. The first three of these show the DD estimates using a control group of fathers of infants in all other states, and control groups of fathers of 1-to 3-and 2-to 4-year-olds in California, respectively. 32 The fourth through sixth columns show results from DDD models, with varying sets of time and location controls, and where our preferred specification, in column 4, is the most comprehensive in that it controls for a full set of state-by-year fixed effects. The last column shows DDD results for mothers using our preferred specification. In specifications that compare across states (columns 1 and 4 through 7), we present p-values from models with standard errors clustered at the state level in parentheses and the F-P p-values in brackets. The F-P p-values are consistently larger than the p-values from inference with clustered standard errors, due to the fact that we only have one treatment state (California), and substantial variation in group sizes (i.e., different numbers of observations across states) that results in heteroskedasticity. In specifications that compare fathers within California (columns 2 and 3), we do not use clustered standard errors as we no longer need to account for spatial correlation in errors within states; thus, we simply present p-values from models with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. The DD coefficients in columns 1 through 3 suggest that CA-PFL leads to a 0.88-1.25 percentage point increase in fathers' leave-taking during the survey reference week, representing a 44 to 63 percent increase from the pre-treatment mean of 1.99 percent. Figures 2 and 3 show the corresponding event-study plots for the models using fathers of infants in other states and fathers of 1-to 3-year-olds in California as control groups, with the coefficients normalized to zero in 2004. 33 Although the estimates are somewhat noisy, there is an indication of an upward trend citizenship status, and we have also controlled for citizenship-year fixed effects and limited the sample to citizens, with similar results (available upon request). 31 Specifically, we use the underlying individual-level data to regress leave-taking rates on paternal demographic controls for: age of youngest child, marital and citizenship status, fathers' age, and race and education, and all race-education interactions. We then use the predicted values from this regression as a \"summary index\" of selection. 32 We present results with fathers of 2-to 4-year-olds as the control group because infant age could be misreported if parents state that they are 1-year-old instead of less than 1. The data suggest that this is not an issue. In the sample of fathers with youngest children 0 to 3 in California, 28.04 percent have an infant less than 1-year-old and 27.18 percent report having a 1-year-old. 33 Appendix Figures A1 and A2 show the corresponding event studies for mothers.

Such an increase over time (rather than an immediate jump) might occur if fathers are learning about the availability of CA-PFL; this interpretation of the figures is consistent with the 146 percent increase in male \"bonding\" claims (from 24,021 to 59,256) filed in California between 2005 and the 2012 to   2013 fiscal year. 34 However, the figures should be viewed as suggestive since they do not rule out the possibility of an upward pre-trend in leave-taking prior to 2004 among fathers of infants in California relative to those in other states. Consequently, we prefer the DDD specification that allows us to flexibly control for state-by-year fixed effects and thus account for differential trends in leave-taking across states. The DDD specification, shown in column 4 of Table 2, suggests that the policy causes a 0.9 percentage point, or 46 percent, increase in leave-taking during the survey reference week from the pre-treatment baseline of 1.99 percent. This model compares fathers of infants to fathers of youngest children aged 1 to 3, in California vs. other states, before and after the introduction of the policy. Results are very similar if fathers of youngest children aged 2 to 4 are used instead, and therefore are not shown. Columns 5 and 6 of Table 2 show that the DDD results are robust to the inclusion of state-specific linear time trends and the exclusion of state-year fixed effects. As mentioned, since the DDD model allows for both national trends in leave-taking among fathers with infants, as well as state-specific trends in leavetaking overall, subsequent results are only presented for the DDD model. However, results from the DD models are similar.",

However, if we assume that these men were off the job for the full week and births of infants were approximately uniformly distributed throughout the year, our preferred estimates suggest that the program added approximately 2.4 days of leave (0.00915 \u00d7 52 weeks \u00d7 5 days per week) from a pre-treatment baseline of around 5.2 days. The last column of Table 2 shows the effect of CA-PFL on maternal leave-taking behavior using our preferred DDD specification. 35 Similar to Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, and Waldfogel (2013) and Baum and Ruhm (2016), we find that mothers are also more likely to take leave after the introduction of CA-PFL. CA-PFL leads to a 2.3 percentage point increase in leave-taking during the survey reference week among mothers with infants, which represents a 13 percent increase from the pre-treatment baseline. In percentage terms, this is much smaller than the effect estimated for men (13 vs. 46 percent) but it is much larger in absolute terms, since new mothers are more likely to be on leave. Assuming that temporary work absences last for the full survey reference week of five work days, CA-PFL is estimated to increase the leave-taking of new mothers by six days from a base level of around 46 days.",

However, following second or higher-order births, the effect is only 0.35 percentage points (18 percent). This finding is interesting, in part, because it cannot be explained by differences in information about the policy. In supplementary analyses, we found no differences in the effect on leave-taking for the second or higher birth depending on whether the first child was born before or after the policy went into effect. The pre-policy mean rates of leave-taking do not vary significantly by birth order, so this difference is not driven by pre-existing patterns either.

Several possible explanations exist for the relatively stronger effect of CA-PFL on father's leave-taking after first births. Mothers may need the most help caring for their firstborn child given this is their first experience with newborn care and they do not have other child care arrangements in place, so having the father at home may be especially beneficial. Fathers may also feel they need more time off at a first birth to adjust to the changes starting a family entails. Alternatively, fathers may be more willing to take time off to be involved with the care of their first child, but revert back to more traditional gender roles with later children, particularly if the mother is no longer employed or has shifted to a part-time schedule. It is also possible that employer attitudes play a role-companies may be more accepting of a father taking leave for the birth of a first child, and less so for the birth of a subsequent child. Our data do not allow us to distinguish between these channels. 36 To analyze whether or not fathers of boys are more likely to take PFL than fathers of girls, column 2 of Table 3 shows the effect of CA-PFL for fathers whose youngest child is male and the differential effect for fathers whose youngest child is female.",

Interestingly, if anything, the opposite appears to be true among mothers. Column 4 of Table 3 shows that the policy may have a larger effect on mothers of daughters than it does on those with sons (although, again, the interaction coefficient is not significant with the F-P method). Table 4 shows the effects of CA-PFL on fathers' and mothers' leave-taking for families in each quartile of the adjusted household income distribution. Household income is adjusted for the number of adults and number of children in the family with the equivalence scale used in the Census Bureau's supplemental poverty measure (Renwick & Fox, 2016). 38 This measure accounts for family size while also recognizing that expenses are not the same for all family members due to economies of scale (Betson & Michael, 1993). The first four columns show the effects of CA-PFL on fathers' leave-taking by quartile. The results suggest the effects of this policy are nonlinear and appear to be driven by fathers in the top and bottom quartile. The last four columns show analogous estimates for mothers' leave-taking. The effects for mothers are again non-monotonic in household income, but the effect is largest (and only statistically significant with the F-P method) for those in the 26th to 50th percentile of the adjusted income distribution. Interestingly, the mean leave-taking rates are also different across family income. However, while the results in Table 4 provide suggestive evidence of some heterogeneity in effects of PFL by household income, we note that the differences across groups are not statistically significant. Moreover, these results should be interpreted with caution as the measure of household income available in the ACS is endogenous to past leave-taking decisions. 39 Finally, in exploratory analyses, we also examined heterogeneity in leave-taking by fathers' demographic characteristics. We obtain suggestive evidence that the effects are smallest among Hispanic fathers (relative to non-Hispanic White, African-American, and Asian fathers), although small sample sizes prevent us from making definitive conclusions. 40 We also found that CA-PFL may have a larger effect on fathers with some college or a high school degree than for those with a four-year degree. However, there is no corresponding positive effect for fathers who have not graduated from high school. These results are available upon request. 37  Lundberg and Rose (2002) find that fathers' labor supply and wages increase more in response to births of sons than daughters, which is in contrast to our finding that fathers spend more time at home with newborn boys than girls. However, their study covers a time period with very little availability of PFL for U.S. men. The patterns we find in our data could also be in part driven by selection, since fathers of sons are more likely to live with their children than fathers of daughters (Dahl & Moretti, 2008). However, this effect is relatively small. 38 We divide household income by the equivalence scale, which is computed as follows: Equivalence Scale = (adults + 0.8 * f irst child + 0.5 * other childr en) 0.7 for single-parent households, and Equivalence Scale = (adults + 0.5 * childr en) 0.7 for two-parent households. 39 Results using a measure of adjusted predicted household income are available upon request. We predict household income by regressing it on all observable demographic characteristics of the parents included in equation 1. 40 Small sample sizes arise in part because we require the fathers in our sample to be employed and residing with their children. For example, there are only 49 Black fathers of infants on leave in California in the whole sample, and only 1000 Black fathers of infants in California overall. Cluster-robust p-values in parentheses. p-values calculated using the Ferman-Pinto method are in brackets. The coefficient is the DDD effect of CA-PFL on fathers' (or mothers') leave-taking, comparing fathers (or mothers) of infants to those of 1-to 3-year-olds, in California vs. other states, before and after the introduction of CA-PFL for fathers (or mothers). Each column limits the sample to parents in the specified quartile of the adjusted household income distribution,",

To examine household leave-taking, Table 5 explores effects on leavetaking in two-parent households. In column 1, we study households where the father is employed and the mother does not work. Columns 2 through 5 further limit the sample to households with fathers who have employed spouses, so that both parents are potentially eligible to take paid leave. Demographic controls for both spouses are included in the regressions, which are weighted by the ACS household weights. 41 The estimated coefficients suggest that fathers in both types of households are more likely to take leave after CA-PFL goes into effect. Column 1 shows that the policy increases leave-taking during the survey reference week among fathers in households where mothers do not work by 0.4 percentage points, or 25 percent at the sample mean. However, this coefficient is only significant with clustered standard errors, and not according to the F-P method. Column 2 demonstrates that, in households where both parents work, CA-PFL increases leave-taking during the survey reference week by either parent by 4 percentage points, or 22 percent. The increase in fathers' leave-taking is driven both by a 0.41 percentage point rise in the probability that both parents are on leave at the same time (a 28 percent increase) and a 0.53 percentage point increase in father-only leave, while the mother is at work (a 50 percent increase). Note, however, that these results are only suggestive as the F-P p-values are above 0.1. 42 The increase in father-only leave-taking indicates that providing CA-PFL to fathers-in addition to mothers-may increase the total number of days that at least one parent stays home with the infant. Married employed mothers are substantially more likely to take leave after the CA-PFL program comes into effect as well, and they are almost always on leave while the father is at work. Finally, Appendix Tables A3 and A4 show the heterogeneous effects for the household leave-taking outcomes by birth order and gender, respectively. 43 Although the results are often imprecisely measured using the F-P method, the point estimates are consistent with the earlier results. Fathers are more likely to take leave on their own when their child is male, but no more likely to do so if the child is a girl. This gender difference is also reflected in the probability that both parents are on leave at the same time. The increase in father-only leave-taking is driven entirely by leaves taken after first births.",

While this assumption is inherently untestable, the fact that our results are very consistent across the DD and DDD specifications and robust to different sets of controls is reassuring. We also perform a variety of other robustness tests that lend credibility to the identifying assumption. Table 6 shows that the findings are similar if the data are collapsed down to the state-year level or if control groups are chosen to best match pre-policy trends in fathers' leave-taking using synthetic control methods (Abadie, Diamond, & Hainmueller, 2010). The first column shows the DD estimate of the effect of the policy on the share of fathers of infants on leave in California compared to all other states. The Donald and Lang (2007) two-step approach is used to obtain the estimates and standard errors, so inference is conducted using a t-distribution with 12 degrees of freedom. The effect size is very similar to the estimate obtained using individual-level data, with CA-PFL predicted to raise paternal leave taking by 0.8 percentage points in both cases. The Donald and Lang approach for calculating standard errors is often used to conduct inference when there are a small number of clusters. While 50 clusters are normally assumed to be large enough for the asymptotic results of cluster-robust standard errors to apply, recent work shows that the \"effective\" number of clusters is smaller when the number of observations per cluster varies across groups, as is true in the uncollapsed data (Carter, Schnepel, & Steigerwald, 2017), so that the cluster-robust standard errors could be underestimated. However, the fact that, for most cases, inference is the same using the Donald and Lang two-step approach and when using cluster-robust standard errors on the uncollapsed data suggests this is not a major issue.",

Because the majority of data in 2000 comes from the Census, instead of the ACS, one may be concerned about comparability between 2000 and the other years. In particular, the Census data are collected over a relatively short time span whereas the ACS is conducted throughout the year.

In relative terms, this increase is much larger than the 13 percent growth estimated for mothers of infants, although because mothers take so much more leave, the absolute rise is much smaller (at around two days). Interestingly, the predicted increase in male leave-taking is similar to the estimate found in Baum and Ruhm's (2016) analysis of CA-PFL, using a much smaller and non-representative sample, while the rise in mother's leave-taking is considerably smaller than that obtained by either Baum and Ruhm (2016) or Rossin-Slater, Ruhm and Waldfogel (2013). 48 The increases we find are meaningful but nevertheless suggest that fathers are taking up only about a quarter of the leave for which they are eligible-an average of 1.5 weeks out of a total of six possible weeks. As such, our results suggest that any possible increases in employer costs associated with fathers using CA-PFL are likely to be small. In contrast, mothers are taking up about nine weeks on average of the 12 weeks total they are potentially eligible for (combining six weeks of TDI leave for birth mothers and six weeks of PFL for all mothers).",

In households where both parents are employed, about half of fathers' leave-taking occurs at the same time that the mother is off work and the other half takes place when she is working. This suggests that CA-PFL increases the total amount of time that a parent spends at home with a new child.",

As hypothesized, we find that the effect of CA-PFL on fathers' leave-taking is larger for fathers of first-borns than for fathers of higher order children, while there is no such difference for mothers. These patterns may reflect joint decisions made by mothers and fathers together, if, for example, they feel there is less need for exclusive paternal care for a second or later child (perhaps because the family has existing child care arrangements or because the mother has stopped working or moved to part-time work), or they may reflect greater financial constraints on leave-taking by (often higher paid) fathers for later children.",

If so, such policies would have implications for reducing gender disparities.",

            "text": "Although women currently make up nearly half of the United States labor force, the gender wage gap still persists, with full-time female workers earning 77 percent of what their male counterparts earn. 49 Further, mothers have traditionally performed a disproportionate share of child care and housework, and this disparity also persists today (Bianchi, 2011;Bianchi et al., 2012;Blair & Lichter, 1991;Hochschild & Machung, 1989). The unequal burden faced by women in the home, combined with a lack of flexibility in work schedules at most jobs, may be an important explanation for why the gender wage gap still exists despite tremendous progress in women's educational and labor market performance over the last half century (Goldin, 2014). Increased leave-taking by fathers-including time at home while mothers work-has the potential to promote gender equality. Moreover, to the extent that gendered patterns of child care provision develop early on, even relatively small changes in initial paternity leave decisions may have important consequences. 50 Overall, we find that California's PFL policy has led to a large relative increase in leave-taking among fathers of infants when compared to the low pre-PFL mean. Although the average number of days spent on leave is small compared to mothers, there has been a substantial increase in the share of fathers who take at least some time off work. Results are fairly consistent across demographic groups, suggesting that the effects of the policy are likely to be generalizable across states.",

To test this, we estimated a DD model comparing fathers of 1-to 3-year-olds in California to those in other states. If anything, we find evidence that fathers of 1-to 3-year-olds are more likely to take leave after CA-PFL, meaning our estimates may understate the effect for fathers of infants.

The purpose of this bootstrap is to provide asymptotic refinement in the presence of clustered errors. It essentially performs a permutation test by imposing the null hypothesis and resampling the residuals-rather than re-estimating the key coefficient of interest-and then asking how likely it would be to observe the key coefficient by chance. As such, only p-values (not standard errors) are generated. SeeFerman and Pinto (2016) for more details.30  Column 2 ofTable 1is based on a DD model comparing fathers of children age 3 and younger in California to those in other states. Using all men aged 15 to 55, we find a significant negative correlation between PFL and having an infant. This is driven by a relative increase in the number of single immigrants to California, and disappears when we control for the share of citizens.
