            "text": "The cytokinetic apparatus of animal cells consists of a transient, dynamic array of actin filaments and myosin-2-the contractile ring-and proteins that link it to the plasma membrane. Constriction of the contractile ring must draw the cell surface between the poles of the mitotic apparatus, separating centrosomes and sister chromosomes, to properly partition daughter cells. To ensure this, cytokinetic apparatus formation depends on spatial cues conferred upon the cortex by the mitotic apparatus.",

            "text": "For over a century, biologists have speculated that \"astral rays\" extending from the spindle poles might transmit the cytokinetic signal to the cell surface (B\u00fctschli, 1876). With the proof that astral rays are based on microtubules (Harris, 1961), that microtubule destruction prevents cytokinesis (Beams and Evans, 1940;Hiramoto, 1956;Hamaguchi, 1975), and that opposing asters can direct cytokinesis without an intervening spindle (Rappaport, 1961), the role of astral microtubules as cytokinetic signal transmitters became ensconced in essentially all models of animal cytokinesis (for review see Burgess and Chang, 2005). A variety of specific molecular hypotheses are based on this assumption: delivery of signals from spindle to cortex via microtubule motors (Wright et al., 1993;Adams et al., 1998;Powers et al., 1998;Minestrini et al., 2003), signaling at the cortex via plus end tracking proteins (Inoue et al., 2004;Strickland et al., 2005a), and local sequestration of cytokinetic regulators at the cortex by microtubule binding (Mandato et al., 2000;Dechant and Glotzer, 2003;Birkenfeld et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The assumption that microtubules transmit the cytokinetic signal has also engendered long-running debates about the nature of the microtubule population responsible for signal delivery. These debates include whether astral microtubules deliver a positive or negative signal to the cortex (Wolpert, 1960;Schroeder, 1981;Rappaport, 1986), whether more microtubules contact the equatorial or the polar cortex after anaphase onset (Asnes and Schroeder, 1979;White and Borisy, 1983;Dechant and Glotzer, 2003;Motegi et al., 2006), whether more microtubule ends from opposing asters contact the equator or not (Devore et al., 1989;Harris and Gewalt, 1989;Yoshigaki, 1999), and whether dynamic properties of microtubules reaching the cortex are determinants for signal A nimal cells decide where to build the cyto kinetic apparatus by sensing the position of the mitotic spindle. Reflecting a longstanding pre sumption that a furrowinducing stimulus travels from spindle to cortex via microtubules, debate continues about which microtubules, and in what geometry, are essential for accurate cytokinesis. We used live imaging in urchin and frog embryos to evaluate the relationship between microtubule organization and cytokinetic fur row position. In normal cells, the cytokinetic apparatus forms in a region of lower cortical microtubule density.",

In all three species, regardless of imaging plane, three observations were remarkably consistent. First, microtubules arrived in every part of the cortex, including the equator, before furrowing ( Fig. 1 A, B [ii-iv], and C; Fig. 2, A\ue039-C; and Fig. S1 D\ue039). Second, after anaphase onset, most astral microtubules at the cortex were stable, regardless of orientation (Fig. 2, A\ue039-C; and Fig. S1 D\ue039). Third, astral microtubules reached the cortex in greater density outside the furrow region (Figs. 1 C, 2, and S1 D). The last point was confirmed by imaging both microtubules (with 3C-EMTB) and active Rho, the earliest known marker for cytokinetic apparatus specification (with GFP-rhotekin GTPase-binding domain [rGBD]; Benink and Bement, 2005) in X. laevis embryos ( Fig. 2 D), which showed that microtubules arrived at the cortex before Rho activation even in very large cells, and that the Rho zone occupied a microtubule-poor region of the cortex.",

However, EMTB-3G detects apparently stable microtubules throughout the cortex in later embryos (eight-cell and beyond). We tested whether these are nocodazole insensitive by perfusing eight-cell and older EMTB-3G-expressing embryos with nocodazole. Consistent with previous results, 10-20-\u00b5M nocodazole treatment during anaphase prompted rapid loss of most astral microtubules but left a substantial fraction extending from each spindle pole ( Fig. 3 and Video 3). However, in contrast to the results obtained with delivery (Mandato et al., 2000;Canman et al., 2003;Shannon et al., 2005;Strickland et al., 2005b;Foe and von Dassow, 2008;Odell and Foe, 2008;Vale et al., 2009). These cannot be dismissed as model system-dependent variation, as different studies in the same system have reached opposite conclusions (see Dechant and Glotzer, 2003vs. Motegi et al., 2006vs. Verbrugghe and White, 2007.",

            "text": "Newer findings change the details but not the notion that microtubules deliver the cytokinetic signal. Specifically, recent work demonstrates at least two experimentally separable cytokinetic signals: one from the spindle midzone and one from the asters (Bringmann and Hyman, 2005;Werner et al., 2007;Baruni et al., 2008;von Dassow, 2009). Also, it is now clear that activation of the small GTPase Rho at the cell equator is a conserved feature of animal cytokinesis (Bement et al., 2005), and this event is attributed to the centralspindlin complex, which consists of the kinesin MKLP1 and MgcRacGAP, working with Ect2, a Rho GEF (Y\u00fcce et al., 2005;Zhao and Fang, 2005;Kamijo et al., 2006;Nishimura and Yonemura, 2006). A popular scenario posits that MKLP transports centralspindlin along microtubules to the equatorial cortex, where it meets and activates Ect2, locally activating Rho (Saint and Somers, 2003;Somers and Saint, 2003;D'Avino et al., 2006). Delivery of a positive signal to the equator may be complemented by provision of a negative signal by dynamic microtubules that contact the cortex elsewhere (Werner et al., 2007;Chen et al., 2008;Murthy and Wadsworth, 2008;Foe and von Dassow, 2008). Surprisingly, however, no direct proof has ever been offered that microtubules must contact the cortex for transmission of the cytokinetic signal. This is partly because it is hard to disrupt microtubules before anaphase onset without inducing metaphase arrest. Also, in large cells where signal transport might be most important, the means to clearly image microtubules extending to the cell surface have been lacking.",

We find that a functional cytokinetic apparatus forms and closes in the proper position in the complete absence of contact or even approach of astral microtubules with the cortex in very large, round cells. We also find that pairs of asters without an intervening spindle can specify a functional cytokinetic apparatus only when they are separated sufficiently from each other. We show that the centrosomes or asters confine the signal or its effect. Based on these and other results, we propose that distinct subsets of the mitotic apparatus collaborate to make specification of the cytokinetic apparatus both accurate and precise.",

Every zygotes, in these smaller cells, there was no obvious directional bias of nocodazole-insensitive microtubules toward the equator before furrowing (Fig. 3), which indicates that these stable microtubules cannot solely explain cytokinetic pattern formation. . Microtubules approach the cortex everywhere before anaphase onset (1 min, 30 s); during anaphase, just before furrowing, many astral microtubules penetrate both polar and equatorial cortex (arrowheads in A\ue039). (B) Vegetal view, 28-cell sand dollar embryo; i-vi are 2\u00d7 enlarged views as indicated. Astral microtubules frequently cross spindle midplane before and during anaphase (i-iii), approach within 1 \u00b5m of the equatorial surface before furrowing (ii-iv), and curve inward as the furrow ingresses (v and vi). Arrowheads point to exemplars. (C) Eight-cell sand dollar embryo; single microtubules grow as far as the cell surface in all directions (equatorially in the 01:56 frame, tropically in the 01:08 frame, and toward the pole in the 03:32 frame). Astral microtubules reach the polar cortex most densely in anaphase (08:48) but also reach the equator before furrowing (frame 10:48). (C\ue039) Enlargement of successive frames for microtubules indicated by arrowheads in C (intensities squared to enhance contrast). Video 1 corresponds to A-C. Time is indicated in minutes:seconds.

The whole of each of three cells is shown the modestly separated chromosomes even when the closest detectable approach by a spindle microtubule to the cell surface was >10 \u00b5m (Fig. 4 C and Fig. S4 B). Only failure to enter anaphase prevented furrowing. In a minority of cells, the ingressing furrow initially failed to separate the chromosome sets. However, in many of these, the cell corrected this error as the constricting furrow approached the spindle, either by the spindle being moved back and forth until it matched the furrow position, or by shifting the furrow toward the spindle midzone (not depicted).",

To complement live imaging, we treated embryos with TSA, then fixed and stained for tubulin and serine-19 phosphorylated myosin light chain (phospho-myosin; a marker for active myosin-2 and the cytokinetic apparatus). 3D reconstructions of these embryos showed clearly that a functional cytokinetic apparatus, replete with active myosin-2, forms at the equator of TSA-treated cells in the complete absence of approach of spindle microtubules to the cortex ( Fig. 5), which eliminates the possibility that the apparent lack of astral microtubules seen by live cell imaging reflects either deficiencies in the EMTB-3G probe or the imaging regimen. Finally, the possibility that the cytokinetic pattern formed long before TSA took effect was ruled out by cases in which TSA was applied before metaphase; the cell depicted in Fig. S4 B, for example, never achieved long astral microtubules in this cell cycle. We find it impossible to escape the conclusion that abolishing contact between astral microtubules and the cell cortex simply does not prevent the cell from assembling a normally positioned, functional cytokinetic apparatus.",

We therefore assessed cytokinetic pattern formation using GFP-rGBD, alone or in combination with 3C-EMTB. The Rho zone was harder to detect in TSA-treated cells, but was definitely present (Fig. 6, C and D), which confirmed that cells can confine Rho activation to the equator without help from asters. TSA-treated cells, like normal cells, exhibited ubiquitous low-level cortical Rho activity that declined after anaphase onset ( Fig. 6 D). However, the Rho zone was much wider than normal in TSA-treated cells (Fig. 6 A). Measurement cell that entered anaphase (as deduced from emergence of a dark gap between spindle halves), regardless of the extent of the surviving aster, established a well-placed furrow. This is epitomized by Fig. 3 B: cytokinesis occurred in one cell that entered anaphase just when nocodazole was added (and completely lacked long astral microtubules) but not in three metaphase-arrested cells.",

But because nocodazole must be applied after anaphase onset to avoid metaphase arrest, it might be that signaling occurred in the narrow window before nocodazole took effect. Also, although nocodazole greatly shortened microtubules extending from the spindle to the cell surface, perhaps stable microtubules were still close enough to mediate equatorial delivery. To inhibit astral microtubule growth without cell cycle arrest, we therefore treated embryos with trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDAC6 (a tubulin deacetylase) that selectively disrupts dynamic microtubules in mammalian cells (Matsuyama et al., 2002). Perfusion of urchin embryos with TSA in prophase or metaphase caused rapid collapse of the aster and usually a delay, but not an arrest, in metaphase ( Fig. 4; Videos 4 and 5; and Figs. S3 and S4).",

However, we noticed that anucleate cytoplasts that manifest deeply ingressing furrows have a greater separation between adjacent asters (Fig. 7, A vs. B). This is apparent even within a single case: in Fig. 7 C, deeply ingressing furrows develop between well-separated asters, and only shallow furrows develop between closer pairs. This correlation was quantified by comparing the distance between centrosomes versus the distance from the surface, versus the extent of furrowing (see Materials and methods). As shown in Fig. 7 E, if the distance between centrosomes exceeded The results of TSA treatment show that cells can accurately position the cytokinetic apparatus without the astral microtubule array. Yet numerous classical results identified the juxtaposition of two asters as the sufficient condition for furrow induction (e.g., Rappaport 1961). To resolve this contradiction, we created EMTB-3G-expressing cell fragments that contain centrosomes but lack nuclei (see Materials and methods). These anucleate cytoplasts conduct a normal centrosome cycle: duplication and separation, and cyclic alternation between a compact, dense, and dynamic aster (metaphase) and a loose aster of long, stable microtubules (interphase). Anucleate cytoplasts with two or more centrosomes exhibited a full spectrum of cytokinetic behaviors: some showed no sign of cleavage; some cleaved completely; and in some, furrows ingressed some distance before regressing (Fig. 7, A-C; and , treated with 20 \u00b5M TSA at time 00:00. A\ue039 shows a 2\u00d7 enlarged view of the indicated cell (white mark in A). Within minutes of TSA addition in metaphase, asters were reduced to nearly nothing (04:00). Despite reduction in spindle length, cells enter anaphase (07:20) and complete cytokinesis (11:20-16:10). No microtubules connecting the mitotic apparatus to the cortex are visible (see Video 4).

Meanwhile, nocodazole and TSA treatment show that the astral microtubules need not reach the cortex for the cell to accurately identify the appropriate furrow site, although the cytokinetic apparatus is more broadly specified in the absence of asters. These results could be reconciled if the central spindle localizes a positive signal, and the astral microtubules or centrosomes suppress cortical contractility outside the equator, thereby sharpening this signal at the cortex. A second hypothesis is that a positive signal from the spindle midzone is spatially confined by the asters or centrosomes, perhaps by interacting with astral microtubules or Figure 6.

Even so, some crucial observations emerged: first, Rho zones appeared even in cells with extreme ablations; second, anaphase (e.g., Fig. 8 A), as confirmed by conducting ablations in cells coexpressing EMTB-3G and mC-H2B ( Fig. S5 B and Video 8). Ablation of a single centrosome in metaphase consistently shifted furrows from the spindle midzone toward the ablated pole (Fig. 8, Video 7, and Fig. S5). If the aster regrew substantially, or if the ablation took place in anaphase, no displacement of the furrow resulted (see Fig. S5 C). Partial ablations, in which some microtubules regrew from the irradiated pole, led to modest displacement. Complete ablations caused cells to establish furrows that closed near (Fig. 8, A,  B, and D) or beyond (Fig. S5, A and C) the ablated aster, Figure 7. Asters alone induce furrows only if they are far enough apart. (A-C) Single-plane sequences of anucleate, centrosome-containing cytoplasts (sand dollars).

In several instances, we accomplished this operation with minimal aster regrowth and without preventing anaphase (Fig. 8, C and D; and Fig. S5 B). In some doubly ablated cells that executed anaphase, cleavage failed, and cells exhibited only incoherent surface ruffling. Other doubly ablated cells initiated broad, shallow furrows, approximately over the midzone (Fig. 8 C). Many of these completed cytokinesis, often (not always) partitioning daughter chromosomes to daughter cells (compare two doubly ablated cells in Fig. S5 B). these zones were not notably different (broader, brighter, or dimmer) than zones in normal cells ( Fig. 8 B and Video 9); and third, rather than appearing asymmetrically (as one would expect if asters only inhibited Rho activation), zones were centered on the eventual furrow site. Importantly, we did not find more Rho activity than normal on the polar cortex near ablated centrosomes, which implies that asters or centrosomes shape the distribution of the cytokinetic signal rather than only inhibiting it; if the latter were true, we would expect Rho activation to take place in a normal spatial relation to the intact centrosome instead of shifting distally, as we observed. myosin-2 network by displaced asters in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos (Werner et al., 2007).

Simple inhibition would predict that the Rho zone would be broader and brighter after destruction of one or both asters, in contrast to what we observed. Instead, the Rho zone is diluted by reduction of the asters with TSA, and ablation of a single centrosome shifts the Rho zone away from the remaining aster without increasing the intensity or breadth.

The use of a live microtubule label reveals unambiguously and for the first time that microtubules from paired asters penetrate the cortex extensively, regardless of whether a furrow forms, and paired asters induce furrows only if there is a microtubule-poor corridor between them. This further argues that the centrosomes or asters limit, rather than create, the cytokinetic signal, as otherwise, closely separated asters would be more potent furrow inducers than distant ones. Anucleate cytoplasts lack chromosomes or midzone but likely retain the molecular species that normally generate the cytokinetic signal. Therefore, if the asters spatially confine the signal rather than simply inhibiting or promoting it, then perhaps juxtaposed asters, in anucleate cytoplasts or toroidal cells, elicit furrowing by concentrating enough of the participants between them.",

Actin can support myosin-powered vectorial transport, but F-actin is dispensable for cytokinetic apparatus specification (Straight et al., 2003;Bement et al., 2005;Foe and von Dassow, 2008). Intermediate filaments and membrane systems permeate the cell but are inherently nonpolar, so it is hard to imagine how they could conduct signals from spindle to cortex. We are led to hypothesize that the primary signal for cytokinesis reaches the cell surface from the spindle by diffusion.",

First, if the signal is inactivated or sequestered at centrosomes or by astral microtubules (even if they do not reach the cortex), lateral spreading would be suppressed. Centrosomal inactivation could occur by microtubule-independent means as described previously for polarization in C. elegans embryos (Cowan and Hyman, 2004). Sequestration could result from microtubule binding by MKLP1 or other candidate signaling agents. This is consistent with results from TSA treatment, collectively implying that asters confer accuracy and precision to the cytokinetic signaling mechanism. To quantify this we scored all centrosome-ablated, EMTB-expressing cells that made credible attempts at cleavage into three categories: double ablations, partial single-pole ablations, and total singlepole ablations. In each, and in controls from the same films, we measured the concurrence of furrow plane and spindle midzone, normalized by cell diameter. The results, superimposed upon normal curves computed from mean and variance in each category (Fig. 8 E), show that doubly ablated cells are less precise than controls but accurate in aggregate, whereas singly ablated cells are precisely inaccurate.",

Although it could be argued that our experimental approaches account for this result, the EMTB probes reveal both dynamic and stable microtubules, and precisely colocalize with all astral and cortical microtubules revealed by anti-tubulin in fixed samples. The cortical distribution of microtubules seen in living cells with EMTB parallels that detected by careful EM analysis of urchin zygotes (Asnes and Schroeder, 1979). Thus, if there is some significant cortical microtubule population not detected by EMTB-based probes, it is also undetectable by any other means currently available. Moreover, the same results are obtained in fixed samples never microinjected with EMTB nor subjected to live imaging, and the TSA results are supported by those obtained with nocodazole. Collectively, these results compel the conclusion that neither astral microtubules extending from centrosomes to regions outside the equator, astral microtubules extending from centrosomes to the equator, nor microtubules extending from the midzone to the equator are necessary for delivery of the cytokinetic signal from the spindle to the cortex.",

This idea is not new, but the approach-centrosome ablation in urchin blastomeres-complements those used in other studies and affirms this principle in urchin embryos. The latter point is critical: it has been vigorously argued, based on micromanipulation studies of urchin zygotes, that asters provide a positive signal that is summed at the equator (for reviews see Rappaport, 1996;Burgess and Chang, 2005). If this were true, ablation of a single centrosome should shift cytokinetic apparatus assembly away from the ablated centrosome. In fact, exactly the opposite happens: the cytokinetic apparatus is displaced toward the ablated centrosome, often so far that all chromosomes end up in one daughter cell. An inhibitory signal from the asters is consistent with studies showing that myosin-powered cortical flow is directed away from microtubule-organizing centers (Hird and White, 1993;Benink et al., 2000;Chen et al., 2008), formation of furrows away from asters during cytokinesis in monopolar cells (Canman et al., 2003;Hu et al., 2008), and local symmetry breaking of a cortical than the egg diameter. To prevent stripped eggs from sticking to glass, culture vessels were coated with 1% BSA in FSW before adding eggs. For injection, stripped sand dollar eggs were arranged in a row in an uncoated coverslip-bottom dish that had been cleaned with 95% ethanol. Clean glass is sticky enough to enable microinjection but allow release of injected embryos with gentle swirling.",

Injections were performed on an inverted microscope (TS100; Nikon) equipped with a cooling stage (Dagan Corporation) maintained at 12\u00b0C, using a hanging-joystick oil hydraulic micromanipulator (Narishige) and Picospritzer III (Parker Hannifin Corp.). Needle concentration of RNA was 1 ng/nl or less for GFP-rGBD or mC-H2B, and <0.1 ng/nl for EMTB-3G and 3C-EMTB. We found that injection of higher levels of EMTB-based probes caused increasingly severe early defects, including mitotic spindle bifurcation, due apparently to a delay in metaphase during which duplicated centrosomes prematurely separate or, at the highest levels, complete cell cycle arrest (Fig. S1 A). Notably, for both purple urchins and sand dollars, normal embryos that develop from zygotes injected with 0.05-0.1 ng/nl EMTB-3G mRNA are many times brighter by the 32-cell stage than are the usually defective four-and eight-cell embryos that result from injection of higher levels. We therefore surmise that either the earliest cell divisions are especially sensitive to the introduction of an exogenous microtubule-binding moiety or that rapid expression of this probe cannot be tolerated (perhaps because some slow posttranslational modification renders it less harmful). Therefore, all results reported here on purple urchins and sand dollars come from eight-cell embryos and beyond, injected with a dose of mRNA at which mitotic defects were rare.",

A freehand line selection was drawn along the cell edge and then straightened using ImageJ. Intensities were plotted along a 7-pixel-wide band covering the cell edge, yielding data points (position and intensity) spanning the Rho zone in the furrow. Intensity data were imported into Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Inc.) and fit with a Gaussian curve plus a quadratic equation with small coefficients. The Gaussian curve fits the Rho zone, whereas the quadratic fits the background cortical signal level. The width of the Rho zone was taken as twice the standard deviation of the fit Gaussian curve, which is equivalent to slightly less than the peak width at half maximum height. Total intensity of the Rho zone was taken as the integral under the Gaussian curve from the center plus or minus two standard deviations, minus the integral in the baseline fit over the same region. Zone widths plotted in Fig. 6 B were normalized by the pole-to-pole distance in each measured cell. Significance was judged using the mean difference test in Mathematica.",

Bisection was conducted after pronuclear fusion for uninjected eggs, or \ue07a45 min after fertilization (and after injection) for injected eggs. Bisection yields half zygotes, which by random chance include some pairs in which one half contains the nucleus and a single centrosome and the other half contains only a centrosome. Such pairs were recognized by differential interference contrast microscopy or by staining live cells with Hoechst 33342. Anucleate, centrosomecontaining cytoplasts conduct orderly centrosome duplication and separation on a normal schedule; the nucleated half skips first cleavage, then develops normally as a tetraploid (Fig. 8 D). Among EMTB-3G-expressing anucleate cytoplasts, we scored all cases in which either no furrows or discrete furrows formed (omitting cases in which the cytoplast strangled itself into the shape of a balloon animal, which we took to be a sign of poor health) as follows: for each centrosome pair in focus, we measured, at the time corresponding to anaphase, the distance between centrosomes and divided by the distance from the midpoint between them to the cell surface. We then scored cortical behavior into three categories: (1) no furrow or incoherent ruffling, (2) shallow furrow, or (3) deep or complete furrow.

All ablations were performed on sand dollar embryos using 365-nm light and a 60\u00d7 1.25 NA Plan-Fluor oil lens; the suboptimal NA of this lens imposes a nearly twofold cost in image brightness, but the higher UV transmittance was found to be essential. Double labeling (as in Fig. 8, B-D) further required a double band GFP/dsRed filter set (Chroma Technology Corp.), which imposes a further twofold cost in brightness. To destroy a centrosome in metaphase, as judged by collapse of the aster around it, required rapid pulses (10-20 Hz) at full power over several seconds. This amount of irradiation bleached GFP-based probes by as much as twofold per successful centrosome destruction. Our frequent misses constituted a built-in control: cells subjected to this degree of cytoplasmic irradiation outside the spindle suffered no ill effects (beyond bleaching). We found it difficult, though not impossible, to perform similar ablations in purple urchin embryos, as they are substantially more opaque than sand dollar embryos. Ablated cells and controls from the same recordings were analyzed using ImageJ by making three measurements: the pole-to-pole cell length, the midpoint between the spindle ends (not poles, as one or both were destroyed), and the position of the",

(A-D) Single-plane recordings of sand dollar embryos expressing EMTB-3G alone (A) or GFP-rGBD (red) and 3C-EMTB (cyan; B-D); time is shown in minutes:seconds after last irradiation. Arrows, ablation sites; dotted lines, furrow plane. (A) Single-pole ablation in a moderately large cell. Few astral microtubules remain; furrowing occurs over the spindle end rather than the midzone (seeVideo 7). (B) Two single-pole ablations. Furrows form over and close upon the ablated end. In the top cell, chromosomes are partitioned by the furrow; in the bottom cell, they are not. Rho activity zones in ablated cells are similar to normal cells but shifted. (C) Double-pole ablation in a large cell. A broad furrow with barely detectable Rho activity forms above the spindle midplane and closes between spindle halves. (D) A normal cell (left), singly ablated cell (top), and doubly ablated cell (right). The furrow in the doubly ablated cell is broad, with dilute Rho activity, but closes accurately. The furrow in the singly ablated cell is shifted away from the midplane. (E) Distances (percentage of cell length) between spindle midplane and furrow plane in control, double-, and single-ablated cells (dots) superimposed upon normal curves computed from mean and standard deviation. Video 9 corresponds to B-D.",
