Statistical analysis of the compartmental fluctuations in diverse metabolic compartments, including biofluids, tissue and cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in relation to microbial population modulation generated a novel top-down systems biology view of the host response to probiotic intervention. Probiotic exposure exerted microbiome modification and resulted in altered hepatic lipid metabolism coupled with lowered plasma lipoprotein levels and apparent stimulated glycolysis. Probiotic treatments also altered a diverse range of pathways outcomes, including amino-acid metabolism, methylamines and SCFAs. The novel application of hierarchical-principal component analysis allowed visualization of multicompartmental transgenomic metabolic interactions that could also be resolved at the compartment and pathway level. These integrated system investigations demonstrate the potential of metabolic profiling as a top-down systems biology driver for investigating the mechanistic basis of probiotic action and the therapeutic surveillance of the gut microbial activity related to dietary supplementation of probiotics.",

            "text": "The gut microbiome-mammalian 'Superorganism' (Lederberg, 2000) represents a level of biological evolutionary development in which there is extensive 'transgenomic' modulation of metabolism and physiology that is a characteristic of true symbiosis. By definition, superorganisms contain multiple cell types, and the coevolved interacting genomes can only be effectively studied as an in vivo unit in situ using topdown systems biology approaches (Nicholson, 2006;Martin et al, 2007a). Interest in the impact of gut microbial activity on human health is expanding rapidly and many mammalianmicrobial associations, both positive and negative, have been reported (Dunne, 2001;Verdu et al, 2004;Nicholson et al, 2005;Gill et al, 2006;Ley et al, 2006). Mammalian-microbial symbiosis can play a strong role in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds and can also be influential in the etiology and development of several diseases, for example insulin resistance (Dumas et al, 2006), Crohn's disease (Gupta et al, 2000;Marchesi et al, 2007), irritable bowel syndrome (Sartor, 2004;Martin et al, 2006), food allergies (Bjorksten et al, 2001), gastritis and peptic ulcers (Warren, 2000;Marshall, 2003), obesity (Ley et al, 2006;Turnbaugh et al, 2006), cardiovascular disease (Pereira and Gibson, 2002) and gastrointestinal cancers (Dunne, 2001). Activities of the diverse gut microbiota can be highly specific and it has been reported that the establishment of Bifidobacteria is important for the development of the immune system and for maintaining gut function (Blum and Schiffrin, 2003;Salminen et al, 2005;Ouwehand, 2007). In particular, elevated counts in Bifidobacterium with reduced Escherichia coli, streptococci, Bacteroides and clostridia counts in breast-fed babies compared to formula-fed neonates may result in the lower incidence of infections, morbidity and mortality in breast-fed infants (Dai et al, 2000;Kunz et al, 2000). As the microbiome interacts strongly with the host to determine the metabolic phenotype (Holmes and Nicholson, 2005;Gavaghan McKee et al, 2006) and metabolic phenotype influences outcomes of drug interventions (Nicholson et al, 2004;Clayton et al, 2006), there is clearly an important role of understanding these interactions as part of personalized healthcare solutions (Nicholson, 2006).",

            "text": "One of the current approaches used to modulate the balance of intestinal microflora is based on oral administration of probiotics. A probiotic is generally defined as a 'live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance' (Fuller, 2004). The gastrointestinal system is populated by potentially pathogenic bacteria that are capable of degrading proteins (putrefaction), releasing ammonia, amines and indoles, which in high concentrations can be toxic to humans (Cummings and Bingham, 1987). Probiotic supplementation aims at replacing or reducing the number of potentially harmful E. coli and Clostridia in the intestine by enriching the populations of gut microbiota that ferment carbohydrates and that have little proteolytic activity. Probiotics, most commonly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, can be used to modulate the balance of the intestinal microflora in a beneficial way (Collins and Gibson, 1999). Although Lactobacilli do not predominate among the intestinal microflora, their resistance to acid conditions and bile salts toxicity results in their ubiquitous presence throughout the gut (Corcoran et al, 2005), hence they can exert metabolic effects at many levels. Fermented dairy products containing Lactobacillus have traditionally been used to modulate the microbial ecology (Dunne, 2001). In particular, L. paracasei was shown to modulate the intestinal physiology, to prevent infection of pathogenic bacteria (Sarker et al, 2005), to stimulate the immune system (Ibnou-Zekri et al, 2003), and to normalize gastrointestinal disorders (Martin et al, 2006). L. rhamnosus is also a significant probiotic strain with proven health benefits and therapeutic applications in the treatment of diarrhea (Szynanski et al, 2006), irritable bowel syndrome (Kajander et al, 2005), atopic eczema (Corcoran et al, 2005) and the prevention of urinary tract infections (Reid and Bruce, 2006). However, the functional effects of probiotic interventions cannot be fully assessed without probing the biochemistry of the host at multiple compartmental levels, and we propose that top-down systems biology provides an ideal approach to further understanding in this field. The microbiota observed in human baby flora (HBF) mice have a number of similarities with that found in formula-fed neonates (Mackie et al, 1999), which makes it to be a well-adapted and simplified model to assess probiotics impact on gut microbial functional ecosystems (in particular on metabolism of Bifidobacteria and potential pathogens) and subsequent effects on host metabolism.",

            "text": "Metabolic profiling using high-density data generating spectroscopic techniques, in combination with multivariate mathematical modelling is a tool which is well suited to generate metabolic profiles that encapsulate the top-down system response of an organism to a stressor or intervention (Nicholson and Wilson, 2003). Multivariate metabolic profiling offers a practical approach to measuring the metabolic endpoints that link directly to whole system activity and which are determined by both host genetic and environmental factors (Nicholson et al, 2005). Recently, metabolic profiling strategies have been successfully applied to characterizing the metabolic consequences of nutritional intervention (Rezzi et al, 2007;Wang et al, 2007) the effects of the gut microflora on mammalian metabolism (Martin et al, 2006(Martin et al, , 2007a and mechanisms of insulin-resistance (Dumas et al, 2006). In the current study, 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and targeted ultra performance liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis have been applied to characterize the global metabolic responses of humanized microbiome mice subsequently exposed to placebo, Lactobacillus paracasei or Lactobacillus rhamnosus supplementation. Correlation of the response across multiple biofluids and tissue, using plasma, urine, fecal extracts, liver tissues and ileal flushes as the biological matrices for the detection of dietary intervention, generates a top-down systems biology view of the response to probiotics intervention.",

            "text": "We have recently described that HBF mice supplemented with L. paracasei were characterized by a high gut content of tauroconjugated bile acids due to the inability of gut flora to deconjugate the bile acids, which resulted in high intestinal absorption of dietary lipids, accumulation of lipids in the liver and reduction of lipoprotein levels in plasma when compared to conventional animals (Martin et al, 2007a). Here, we show that probiotics supplementation of HBF mice resulted in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of VLDL and lowdensity lipoproteins (LDL) and increased triglyceride and GPC concentrations in plasma when compared to HBF controls ( Figure 1B). In addition, the Lactobacillus supplementation resulted in decreased fecal excretion of bile acids ( Figure 1C), that may be caused by accumulation of bile acids in Lactobacillus probiotics (Kurdi et al, 2000). These observation indicated probiotic-induced changes in the enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids, which were shown to lower cholesterol and systemic levels of blood lipids (Pereira and Gibson, 2002). Moreover, probiotic-specific modulation of the ileal concentrations of UDCA and CDCA ( Figure 2; Table IV) may also contribute to modulation of the synthesis and secretion of VLDL into the blood (Lin et al, 1996;Watanabe et al, 2004). Moreover, the main source of dietary lipids in animal chow is soybean oil, which is composed at 65% of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is well known that Lactobacillus hydrolyzes soy oil to conjugated linoleic acid efficiently (Xu et al, 2005), which results in a reduction of plasma lipoprotein concentrations and hepatic cholesterol (Fukushima et al, 1996(Fukushima et al, , 1997Al-Othman, 2000) and in the inhibition of S. aureus growth (Das, 2002), as observed in the current study. Furthermore, probiotics supplementation was associated with significant reduction of acetate in the cecal content (Table II) and in a reduced hepatic acetate:propionate ratio, for which a serum lipids lowering effect has previously been described (Wong et al, 2006). Our results illustrate the fine relationship between a specific gut microbial population modulation and the host's lipid metabolism and that a probiotic intervention can provide refined control mechanisms on the host's physiology.",

Levels of leucine and isoleucine were reduced together with their keto-acid derivative (a-keto-isocaproate) in L. paracaseisupplemented mice. These observations suggest higher catabolism of branched-chain amino acids to produce acetyl-CoA and glucose via gluconeogenesis. Decreased levels of citrate in urine and plasma, but increased liver succinate levels may also indicate the shunt of the tricarboxylic acid cycle towards production of phosphoenolpyruvate for gluconeogenesis in L. paracasei-supplemented mice. Moreover, reduction of liver glycogen observed with L. paracasei supplementation is consistent with our other observations of generalized host mobilization of other metabolic fuels.",

Correlation analysis derived from bile acid and fecal flora profiles offers a unique approach to capture subtle variations in bile acid composition that may be directly related to changes in gut microbial levels, and that may be induced by accumulation of bile acids in Lactobacillus probiotics for instance. Control HBF mice and HBF mice supplemented with probiotics show remarkably different bile acid/fecal flora correlation networks. The different bacterial strains of Bacteroides, Clostridia, Streptococci and Lactobacilli share similar abilities to deconjugate the hepatic tauroconjugated bile acids (Midtvedt and Norman, 1967;Floch, 2002). In that regard, the overwhelming contrast between the balance of these bacteria on one hand, and conjugated bile acids (TCDCA, TbMCA, TCA, TUDCA) and unconjugated bile acids (CA, aMCA, bMCA) on the other hand, highlights the metabolic flexibility of the gut microbiota in response to probiotics supplementation. These different correlative patterns further characterize the microbial-mammalian transgenomic metabolic interactions, whereby probiotics-induced modulation of the gut microbial functional ecosystem results in different bile acid composition ( Figure 2) and enterohepatic recirculation.",

In the absence of Lactobacillus supplementation, C. perfringens has anticorrelated connections with TCDCA, aMCA and bMCA, which highlights the strong inhibitory effects of these bile acids on C. perfringens growth. Interestingly, the probiotic supplementation was either associated with maintenance or decrease of the Clostridial population (Table I), while no functional correlations between C. perfringens and bile acids were observed. In that regard, these observations may indicate different nutritional competition leading to modulation of C. perfringens population and maintainance of the intestinal ecology. Consequently, interbacterial cooperation to transform bile acids is an important factor that needs to be considered not only for the fine tuning of microbial balance but also to modulate dietary fat emulsification and absorption.",

The first reaction of the methylamine pathway involves conversion of dietary choline into TMA by gut microbiota (Zeisel et al, 1983), which is then detoxified to TMAO in the liver via the flavine monooxygenase system (Smith et al, 1994; ( Figure 6). L. rhamnosus supplementation contributes to higher absorption of free choline and may induce elevated production of methylamines by Bacteroides and C. perfringens (Allison and Macfarlane, 1989) through nutritional competition.",

Decreased fecal choline was associated with reduced concentrations of TMA and DMA in the liver, an increase in plasma GPC, but with no changes in liver TMAO and plasma choline after L. paracasei supplementation. These animals also showed a greater reduction in plasma lipoproteins when compared to other groups. Here, these observations may result from elevated bacterial consumption for cholesterol assimilation (Rasic, 1992) and phospholipid metabolism (Jenkins and Courtney, 2003;Taranto et al, 2003;Kankaanpaa et al, 2004). Thus, the reduced availability of choline to other bacterial strains may have led to lower production of methylamines and absorption of free choline into host metabolism.",

DMG, dimethylglycine; IA, indoleacetate; MA, methylamine; PA, phenylacetate (see Figure 1). depolymerization of dietary proteins (casein) by pancreatic endopeptidases and bacterial proteases and peptidases, become available for fermentation by the gut microflora (Smith and Macfarlane, 1996), as outlined in Figure 6. Metabolism of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan generates phenylacetate (PA), p-cresol, indoleacetate (IA) and tryptamine, respectively (Donaldson, 1962;Smith and Macfarlane, 1996). PA and IA may be detoxified in the gut mucosa and the liver by glycine conjugation forming PAG and IAG prior to excretion via the urine (Donaldson, 1962;Smith and Macfarlane, 1996). The production of PA and IA has been restricted to a certain taxonomic group of gut bacteria, including Bacteroides, Clostridia and E. coli, which count among the dominant species in HBF colonized mice (Smith and Macfarlane, 1996;Xu et al, 2002). The increased urinary excretion of phenolic and indolic compounds reflects variations in gut microflora composition in relation to nutritional competition (Smith and Macfarlane, 1996;Nowak and Libudzisz, 2006). For instance, IA has been reported to inhibit the growth and survival of Lactobacilli, and specifically L. paracasei (Nowak and Libudzisz, 2006).",

Moreover, increased urinary NAG levels have been reported as a biomarker of increased tubular activity and tubular cell toxicity.

            "text": "H-PCA modelled multicompartmental matrices related to lipid metabolism H-PCA has been explored for the first time as a top-down systems approach to model and integrate metabolic profiles from diverse biological compartments. H-PCA modelling summarized clearly the intercorrelated changes induced by probiotic-treatment in plasma, urine and liver matrices and composition in bile acids (Figure 4). One benefit of the hierarchical approach lies in the much simplified simultaneous visualization of global system biochemical changes in multibiological matrices and improves interpretability. For instance, H-PCA resulted in a separation between the treated groups, which was not observed in separate PCA models. In addition, the H-PCA loadings plot gives the relative importance of the different blocks (biological matrices) in carrying diet-induced discriminant information. Moreover, the relationships between the descriptors in the simplified H-PCA space (H-PCA loadings plot) indicate correlations and anticorrelations between block variables, which may give insight into correlations between the metabolic variations in different biological matrices as exemplified here by metabolic changes in liver, plasma and urine and related to lipid metabolism. The H-PCA model also efficiently summarized the intercorrelated changes related to higher systemic glycolysis in plasma, urine and liver matrices, that is, reduced ketone body formation, anaerobic glycolysis, tricarboxylic cycle perturbation and amino-acid catabolism (Figure 4). Such observations might lead to better description of multiorgan metabolic perturbations ( Figure 4B). This multicompartmental top-down approach offers a way forward to study the systemic biochemical profiles and regulation of function in whole organisms by analyzing simultaneously several metabolite pools from different biofluids and tissues. This approach also provides a new strategy for the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of different probiotic (or indeed any functional food or nutriceutical) interventions in relation to host biochemistry.",

            "text": "Significant associations between host metabolic phenotypes and a nutritionally modified gut-microbiota strongly supports the idea that changes across a whole range of metabolic pathways are the product of extended genome perturbations that can be oriented using probiotic supplementation, and which may play a role in host metabolic health. Bipartite network analysis highlights the metabolic flexibility of the gut microbiota, whereby bacterial strains communicate with each other to metabolize differently bile acids in a gut microbial ecosystem modulated with probiotics. In this case, probiotic consumption exerted a modification over the microbiome resulting in different hepatic influx and efflux of fatty acids in the liver, as observed with increased enterohepatic recycling of bile acids and dietary fats, lowered plasma lipoprotein levels and stimulated glycolysis. Probiotics also induced a different microbial proteolytic activity as well as modulation of bacterial metabolism of amino acids, methylamines and SCFAs. We showed the novel application of H-PCA as a means to study perturbation of metabolic profiles triggered by symbiotic microbiota at a 'global system' level by analyzing several metabolite pools simultaneously from different biofluids and tissues. These integrated system investigations demonstrate the potential of metabolic profiling as a top-down systems biology driver for investigating the mechanistic basis of probiotic action and the therapeutic surveillance of the gut microbial activity related to dietary supplementation of probiotics and their health consequences.",

Bile acids and fecal bacteria correspond to blue ellipse nodes and green rectangle nodes, respectively. Edges are coded according to correlation value: positive and negative correlations are respectively displayed in blue and in red. aMA, a-muricholic acid; Ba, Bacteroides; Bb, B. breve; Bl, B. longum; bMA, b-muricholic acid; CA, cholic acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; Cp, C. perfringens; Ec, E. coli; GCA, glycocholic acid; La, Lactobacillus probiotics; Sa, S. aureus; Se, S. epidermidis; TCA, taurocholic acid; TCDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid; TMCA, tauro-bmuricholic acid; TUDCA, tauroursocholic acid; UDCA, ursocholic acid. * and *** indicate a statistically significant correlation at 95 and 99.9% confidence levels, respectively.",

PCA was carried out using the SIMCA-P 11 software (Umetrics, Ume\u00e5, Sweden) in order to detect the presence of inherent similarities between metabolic profiles. Both NMR and LC-MS variables were subjected to Pareto scaling, by dividing each variable by the square root of its standard deviation. Data were visualized by means of principal component scores and loadings plots. Each point in the scores plot represents an individual biochemical profile of a sample, whereas on the loadings plot each coordinate represents a single NMR spectral region or LC-MS retention time and mass to charge ratio (m/z). Because the scores and loadings plots are complementary, biochemical components responsible for the differences between samples detected in the scores plot can be extracted from the corresponding loadings plot.",

All O-PLS-DA models were constructed using one predictive and two orthogonal components using data scaled to unit variance (i.e. by dividing each variable by its standard deviation). Here, the test for the significance of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was used to calculate the cut-off value of the correlation coefficients at the level of Po0.05. To test the validity of the model against over-fitting, the cross-validation parameter Q 2 was computed and the standard seven-fold cross validation method was used (Cloarec et al, 2005b). The interpretation of the model was achieved from correlation coefficient plots that incorporated a backtransformation method such that the coefficients resembled the original structure of the NMR spectral data (Cloarec et al, 2005b).",

The data are divided into well-defined logical blocks X1, y, XB (where the index B refers to each biosample type), according to an event, instrumentation or biological compartment. A consensus direction among all the blocks is sought. Here, logical blocks were defined according to the biological nature of the samples obtained from the same animals (Figure 3). Hence, five independent blocks of variables were comprised of NMR data from plasma, liver, urine and fecal extracts as well as bile acids composition obtained by UPLC-MS. PCA was performed on each data matrix individually, and block loadings p b and scores t b were generated for each block (Figure 3). All block scores t b were then combined into a super block T. The PCA (H-PCA) was then applied to the super block T to generate the super scores t T and the super loadings p T . The super scores t T gives the relationships between the observations and all the sources of variations. The super loadings p T gives the relative importance of the different blocks XB for each principal component as well as information on the relationship/covariance between the different variables in the different compartments.",
