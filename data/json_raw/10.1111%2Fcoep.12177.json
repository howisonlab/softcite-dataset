Tax price elasticity estimates from a multivariate sample selection model indicate that changing the deduction to a 12% tax credit would have reduced individual donations in 2012 by 18.9% if applied to itemizing taxpayers and by 10.5% if extended to nonitemizers. Elimination of the deduction would have led to a 35% reduction in individual charitable donations. Even if coupled with cuts in marginal tax rates, eliminating the charitable deduction will still likely result in substantial reductions given the inelastic income elasticities of charitable donations. The estimates justify the ardent opposition of many in the nonprofit sector to the more radical proposals for changing the tax treatment of charitable contributions. (JEL D34, C34) I. INTRODUCTION The empirical literature on charitable donations is comprised largely of studies that examine total giving (e.g.",

Like all selection models, the procedure allows the binary (selection) and level outcomes to be determined by separate stochastic processes and relaxes the Tobit parameterization restrictions noted above and discussed below. It also allows correlations of the error terms among all equations, accommodating feedback among all binary and level decisions on donations. To the extent that unobserved factors such as household and institutional characteristics can affect donation activities jointly, the MSSM constitutes an improvement over single equation and bivariate models and multiequation two-step procedures by enhancing the statistical efficiency of the estimates.",

The primary objective is to provide estimated tax price elasticities which can be used to predict the impacts of changes in the tax treatment of charitable contributions on the levels of individual monetary donations to charity. 4 For example, how would changing the charitable deduction to a 12% tax credit, as proposed by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, impact individual contributions to charity? 5 The answer to this question is of enormous importance to nonprofits given that over 70% of all charitable donations comes from individuals. 6 Below in Section II, we detail the shortcomings of the Tobit model and present the MSSM. Data and variables are described in Section III. Results are presented and discussed in Section IV. Section V provides the discussion and conclusions.",

Such presumptions are questionable in the context of charitable donation and, in fact, of most empirical applications. Recently, Brooks (2007) estimates tax price elasticities across six nonprofit subsectors using the log-Tobit model, with the logarithmic transformation for the dependent variable. Apart from the aforementioned parametric restrictions, an additional issue with the log-Tobit model is that maximumlikelihood estimates are not invariant with respect to scaling of the dependent variable. Further, a common approximation to the relative marginal effects of unconditional level of the dependent variable can have a poor property, because the unconditional mean of the dependent vari-",

This suggests that interpreting the coefficient of a log-transformed variable (i.e., an element of \u03b2) as the elasticity based on the exponential term of the expression can result in substantial error as the remaining (probability) term is ignored. We demonstrate the lack of invariance of log-Tobit estimates and proper calculation of elasticity estimates by estimating a log-Tobit model for donation for the needy, a category considered in this article.

Unlike the restrictions imposed by Tobit parameterization, these expressions and the resulting marginal effects (Yen and Rosinski 2008, 5) suggest that though the marginal effect of a common variable in the selection and level equations (say x k = z k with coefficients \u03b2 ik = \u03b1 ik ) on the probability of positive c i is determined exclusively by the coefficients \u03b1 ik , the marginal effects on the conditional and unconditional means of c i are functions of both \u03b1 ik and \u03b2 ik , which can take either sign.

Also noted is that the COPPS data on monetary giving by households which itemize charitable contributions are similar to tax return data except for the very top of the income distribution. The COPPS data have a distinct advantage in examining the charitable behavior of nonitemizers as such data are unavailable from tax returns.

As a precaution, therefore, we include a set of state dummy variables to reduce the likelihood of such bias. The formulation of the tax price in Equation 5presumes that an itemizing household remains an itemizing household even in the absence of the charitable deduction, that is, that itemization status is itself exogenous to charitable giving. For borderline itemizers, such is not the case; as without the charitable deduction, they would choose the standard deduction, so that their itemization status is endogenous to giving. In our sample, such borderline itemizers are identified as households which itemize and make positive monetary donations to charity but face a tax price of one.

Alternatively, they can elect to subtract the standard deduction for their filing status and any applicable personal exemption deduction.

The total impact of a tax price change on the unconditional mean giving level, therefore, derives from two distinct sources: the impact on the likelihood of giving, or equivalently, on the proportion of households that donate and the impact on the amount that donors give. Table 2 reports the tax price elasticities of probabilities, conditional levels, and unconditional levels for the three donation categories, for the full sample. With only one exception, all are highly statistically significant. For both needy and all other, changes in tax prices precipitate changes in both the probability of donating and in the amounts that donors give. In contrast, a tax price change works largely through its impact on the likelihood of giving to CP&IA organizations.",

In this regard, we can compare our estimates only to those reported by Brooks (2007). 13  Brooks (2007) reports a tax price elasticity of donations to the needy of \u22121.33, statistically indistinguishable from minus unity. In contrast, our higher estimate of \u22122.347 strongly supports the alternative hypothesis that donation to the needy is tax-price elastic (p < .0001). For combined purpose giving, Brooks estimates a price elasticity of \u22122.68 in comparison with our much lower estimate of \u22121.423 for CP&IA donations which, again, is significantly greater than unity in absolute value (with a one-tail p = .03). 14 For Canada, Hossain and Lamb (2012) report price elasticity estimates in the range of \u22120.81 for religious donations to \u22122.25 for donations to international organizations.

            "text": "The policy implication of our tax price elasticity estimates is fairly straightforward. Changing the tax treatment of charitable contributions can have substantial impacts on the amounts contributed. We consider a simple proposal put forth by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (Bowles-Simpson Commission) empaneled by President Obama to change the charitable deduction into a nonrefundable tax credit of 12% under two alternative scenarios. Scenario 1 maintains current law and allows only itemizers to take advantage of the credit, while Scenario 2 extends the credit to the charitable donations by taxpayers who do not itemize deductions. The latter scenario is consistent with the Commission's recommendation. Under this proposal, the tax price is equal to 0.88, with a one dollar contribution to charity costing the tax payer $0.88. As such, this exercise can also be viewed as at least a partial evaluation of the proposed changes to the charitable deduction included in the Tax Reform Act of 2014 put forth by former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Representative David Camp. Those proposed changes have been estimated by Rosenberg et al. (2014) to yield an average tax price of $0.88. 15 For the predictions, we presume that the three types of households in our sample-married, single with children, and single-map into the three tax filing statuses of married filing jointly, single head of household, and single. Table 3 15. We note that our evaluation does not incorporate the Bowles-Simpson Commission's accompanying recommendation that the credit apply only to contributions above 2% of adjusted gross income. Nor does it account for any other changes recommended by Camp's tax reform act. Possible macroeconomic effects of these changes are also ignored. The evaluation is partial in nature focusing solely on the effects of a change in tax price on cash donations to charity.  provides estimated tax price elasticities for each of the three types by itemizing status. Note that in all cases, the unconditional tax price elasticities for all categories are higher for nonitemizers than for itemizers. This is consistent with Peloza and Steel (2005) whose meta-analysis tests the usual claim that tax price elasticities will be higher for itemizers than for nonitemizers and finds the exact opposite. Such differences are important when analyzing policies that propose extending the preferential treatment of charitable donations to nonitemizing taxpayers. We use sample mean tax prices and unconditional contribution levels for each household group to calculate changes in donations per household. Using data from Table  1.3 of the 2012 Individual Income Tax Returns available from the Internal Revenue Service, we multiply the per household donation change by the total number of returns filed under each filing status to get estimates of the total change in donations (in billions of 2012 dollars). 16 For the interested reader, details of the calculations are provided in the Tables A2-A4. For Scenario 1, the reduction in contributions is large and comes mostly from the all other category. Summing across the donation types, the total reduction is estimated to be almost $43.3 billion. In 2012, this would have amounted to a 18.9% reduction in individual charitable contributions and a 13.7% reduction in total 16. Table 1.3 for 2012 can be downloaded at http://www. irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Individual-Income-Tax-Returns-Publication-1304-(Complete-Report). charitable contributions. 17 For Scenario 2 which extends the credit nonitemizers, the reduction is almost $24 billion, amounting to a 10.5% reduction in individual contributions and a 7.6% reduction in total contributions. 18 The difference indicates clearly that the moderating impact of extending the credit to nonitemizing taxpayers is substantial. Such estimated impacts are far larger than those that were and would be predicted by Congressional Budget Office (CBO) (2011), Cordes (2011), and Galle, Colinvaux, and Steurle (2012) as these studies assumed a low tax price elasticity of \u22120.5 and a high tax price elasticity of only \u22121.0. Indeed, using these elasticity estimates, we would have predicted reductions in individual (total) contributions ranging from 2.3% to 7.5% (1.7%-5.4%).",

            "text": "Proposals to eliminate the charitable deduction, however, are often coupled with proposed deep cuts in marginal income tax rates. For example, the Carson plan calls for elimination of the charitable deduction with a flat 15% income tax rate. Proponents of such plans argue that reductions in charitable donations would be minimal at worst, given that the cuts in marginal tax rates will raise incomes along with the rate of economic growth. Such optimism may be misplaced. Specifically, estimates of the income elasticity of charitable donations are usually well below one. Our (unreported) income elasticity estimates range from a low of 0.299 for donations to the needy to a high of 0.956 for donations to CP&IA. Using our price elasticity estimates, the percentage reduction in donations from eliminating the charitable deduction range from a low of 35% for CP&IA to a high of 85% for the all other category. Given the income inelastic nature of charitable donations, to offset completely or even substantially these reductions would require any marginal tax rate reduction to yield percentage increases in incomes that are simply not believable. This remains true even with a presumed low price elasticity of \u22120.50. Fundamentally, our results provide justification for the ardent opposition expressed by many in the nonprofit sector and philanthropic community to the more radical proposals for changing the tax treatment of charitable contributions.",
