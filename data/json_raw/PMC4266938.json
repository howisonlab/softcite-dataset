To evaluate gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse event risks associated with optical colonoscopy (OC) among Medicare outpatients who received computed tomography colonography (CTC) as their initial method of colorectal evaluation. Methods. Medicare claims were compared between 6114 outpatients \u226566 years who received initial CTC and 149,202 outpatients who received initial OC between January 2007 and December 2008. OC patients were matched on county of residence and year of evaluation. Outcomes included lower gastrointestinal bleeding, gastrointestinal perforation, other gastrointestinal events and cardiovascular events resulting in an emergency department visit or hospitalization within 30 days. Results. Among 1000 outpatients undergoing initial CTC, 12.4 experienced lower gastrointestinal bleeding, 0.7 perforation, 18.0 other gastrointestinal events and 45.5 cardiovascular events within 30 days. After multivariate adjustment, risks of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, other gastrointestinal events and cardiovascular events were higher with initial OC than CTC, with or without subsequent OC (Odds Ratio 1.91 95 Confidence Interval [1.47,2.49], Odds Ratio 1.35 95 Confidence Interval [1.07,1.69] and Odds Ratio 1.38 95 Confidence Interval [1.18,1.62], respectively); however, perforation risk did not differ (p = 0.10). This pattern is similar in older and symptomatic populations. Conclusion. Rates of gastrointestinal bleeding, other gastrointestinal events and cardiovascular events are lower following initial CTC than OC, but rates of perforation do not differ.",

            "text": "CT colonography (CTC) is an alternative to optical colonoscopy (OC) for colorectal evaluation, including cancer screening and diagnostic evaluation. Although CTC demonstrates a per patient sensitivity of 0.78 in the detection of adenomas at least 6 mm, and an overall sensitivity of 89% in the detection of polyps at least 6 mm in diameter (Johnson et al., 2008;Pickhardt et al., 2003) it may be safer than OC given that CTC does not involve passage of an endoscope or require sedation. Prior case series suggest low rates of gastrointestinal perforation and chest pain among patients who receive CTC; particularly in the screening population (Pickhardt, 2006;Burling et al., 2006;Atkin et al., 2013). However, there is a paucity of population based studies directly evaluating the risk of adverse events following CTC among the elderly where the risks are thought to be higher (Sosna et al., 2006;Rabeneck et al., 2008;Singh et al., 2010;Warren et al., 2009;Rutter et al., 2012;Day et al., 2011;Sharma et al., 2007). This lack of data about the risks and benefits of CTC in the older population, in addition to concerns over the cost effectiveness of this modality, was cited in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) decision to deny coverage for screening CTC in March 2009 (Knudsen et al., 2010;MEDCAC transcript Computed Tomography Colonography, 2008).",

We focused on patients undergoing initial CTC to capture adverse events attributable to the CTC and to any subsequent testing within 30 days (including OC with or without biopsy (Warren et al., 2009;Rutter et al., 2012;Levin et al., 2006)) driven by the findings of the CTC. To provide clinical context CTC patients were compared to a cohort of patients who received initial OC and also stratified by asymptomatic (i.e. screening) and symptomatic (i.e. diagnostic) indications (Pickhardt, 2006;Atkin et al., 2013).",

We performed a retrospective cohort study of all Medicare beneficiaries \u2265 66 years of age in the United States with a claim for CTC between January 2007 and December 2008 and a randomly selected group of patients with a claim for OC during the same time period, matched 9:1 by county of residence and year of colorectal evaluation. Approximately 98% of adults in the United States ages 65 and older are enrolled in Medicare, making Medicare data a robust source of health care utilization ( RDA Center, 2012). Adverse events resulting in an emergency department visit or inpatient admission 30 days following either procedure were determined from Medicare Provider Analysis and Review, Outpatient and Carrier files using appropriate Current Procedural Terminology/Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (CPT/HCPCS) and International Classification of Disease, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes (e- Table 1). We used a 30 day time interval for the assessment of complications to ensure a comparable follow-up interval in both cohorts based on prior data about complications from OC (Warren et al., 2009). Claims were also used to identify comorbidities associated with increased likelihood of adverse events in the year preceding either CTC or OC and comparable adverse events in the preceding 90 days. The analysis focused on patients who had either initial CTC, defined as no OC on the same day or within the prior 12 months, or initial OC, defined as no OC within the prior 12 months. Although 14% of the initial CTC patients in our study underwent OC within the 12 months after CTC, similar to published rates of 13-15% in the literature (Kim et al., 2010;Macari et al., 2011), only 3% (187/6114) of initial CTC patients received OC within 30 days. Due to this small sample size a separate analysis of adverse events among patients who received OC within 30 days of CTC was not performed. However, additional analyses stratified patients by asymptomatic (i.e. screening) and symptomatic (i.e. diagnostic) indications using ICD-9 codes from the CTC or OC claim, based on a previously utilized algorithm (Ko et al., 2010;Zafar et al., 2013); a full list of codes is provided in e-Table 1.",

Because the objective of our study was to evaluate patients who received CTC as the first method of colorectal evaluation we excluded patients who received CTC with OC either in the prior 12 months (n = 3595) or on the same day (n = 3197). Similarly, OC patients who received OC within the prior 12 months were excluded (n = 1994). We also excluded patients with more than one OC within 30 days of the initial OC or CTC (n = 6). Eighteen patients were excluded for CTC claims in the year preceding OC or CTC and thirteen patients were excluded for incomplete billing data. No patients were excluded on the basis of an incomplete procedure. The final study population was comprised of 153,316 patients ( Fig. 1). These 153,316 patients included 3609 CTC and 115,691 OC patients from a prior publication (Zafar et al., 2013). Differences in study populations are due to inclusion and/or exclusion criteria stemming from the disparate foci of these publications.",

Differences in our results may reflect limitations of prior study populations, follow up interval, or measurement approach. Alternatively, these findings may reflect the small number of perforations identified in our study; particularly within the CTC cohort. Although we used the same methodology to identify perforations in both cohorts (i.e., emergency department visits and hospitalizations), CTC is more sensitive to sub-clinical perforation than OC due to the ability to visualize small amount of pneumoperitoneum (Pendse and Taylor, 2013). It is reassuring that our results are similar to perforation rates from a study where patients with pneumoperitoneum on CTC were referred to the emergency department (0.6 per 1000 CTC procedures) (Sosna et al., 2006), which resembles our measurement approach. Our results also extend the previously published literature about the risks of adverse events from CTC among Medicare patients in that we are the first study to assess the risk of lower gastrointestinal bleeding following CTC.",

Our analyses suggest that patients who undergo initial CTC, with or without subsequent OC, may experience lower rates of serious gastrointestinal, other gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events compared to patients who receive initial OC. This finding is intuitively reasonable, given that CTC does not require sedation and the intention of CTC is to selectively refer the approximately 8-15% of patients with suspected clinically significant polyps (N6 mm) and masses to OC for further evaluation (Kim et al., 2007(Kim et al., , 2010Macari et al., 2011). However, it is important to recognize that we were unable to fully adjust for differences between the groups based upon the information available in claims data. Patients who receive CTC are generally sicker than patients who receive OC (Zafar et al., 2013). Furthermore, given the standard CTC technique, which does not include intravenous contrast, the use of a 30 day time interval is conservative and may include adverse events not directly related to this procedure. As such, our results may underestimate the differences between these two examinations.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. We used billing codes from Medicare claims rather than medical record review to determine adverse events. No studies validating the use of billing claims for CTC have been reported. However, prior studies have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for the assessment of procedures, including endoscopy, using Medicare claims compared to medical charts (Schenck et al., 2007;Ko et al., 2011;Javitt et al., 1993) and high likelihood of identifying diagnoses and select adverse events in Medicare claims (Fowles et al., 1995). It is reassuring that our unadjusted adverse event risks among the OC cohort are similar to prior studies (Warren et al., 2009). We did not perform a randomized control trial, and there are likely to be unmeasured confounders or selection effects that we were unable to include in our adjustments. The technique utilized for CTC cannot be derived from claims data but is potentially important given that manual insufflation, luminal disease and use of a rectal balloon are associated with perforation (Pickhardt, 2006;Burling et al., 2006;Sosna et al., 2006;Pendse and Taylor, 2013). Some of the adverse events specific to CT, such as radiation risk, cannot be measured with claims data. Although our findings may not generalize to younger patients, colorectal cancer is predominantly a disease of the elderly.",

Rates of lower gastrointestinal  bleeding, other gastrointestinal events and cardiovascular events are lower following initial CTC, with or without subsequent OC, than following initial OC; similar rates of perforation may stem from the small number of perforations in both cohorts. A similar pattern was demonstrated among patients N 75 years of age and those with symptoms referable to colorectal cancer. These data can help primary care providers and patients seeking to understand complications associated with these methods of colorectal cancer screening and targeted diagnostic evaluation.
