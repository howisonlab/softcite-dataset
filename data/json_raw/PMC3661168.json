            "text": "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a cytosolic protein that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of human tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. Trp depletion induces effector T cells to undergo a G 1 cell cycle arrest 1 and triggers an integrated stress response pathway that involves general control nonrepressed 2 (GCN2) signaling and eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) phosphorylation. 2,3 IDO also causes systemic anergy by inducing naive Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has recently been proposed to account for tumor-induced immunosuppression by influencing the conversion of tryptophan (Trp) into kynurenine (Kyn). The objective of our study was to correlate IDO activity with disease outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NscLc) patients treated with multimodal combination therapy. In a single-arm phase II trial involving induction gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by concurrent paclitaxel, carboplatin and 74 Gy thoracic radiation in stage III NscLc patients, plasma was drawn at baseline, post-induction, and post-concurrent therapy. The mean plasma Kyn/Trp ratio was used as a surrogate indicator of IDO activity. The 33 participants were distributed as follows: 15 females, 18 males; median age = 62; median overall survival (Os) = 22.4 (95% cI 19.3-25.1) months; median progression-free survival (pFs) = 11.5 (95% cI 6.7-16.3) months. The mean Kyn/Trp ratio at baseline (4.5 \u00b1 2.8) was higher than that of healthy controls (2.9 \u00b1 1.9, p = 0.03) and increased after induction therapy (5.2 \u00b1 3.2, p = 0.08) and chemoradiation (5.8 \u00b1 3.9, p = 0.01). The post-treatment Kyn/Trp ratio and radiologic responses were not significantly associated at any time point. No significant correlation was found between baseline Kyn/Trp ratios and Os (hR = 1.1, 95% cI 0.45-2.5) or pFs (hR = 0.74, 95% cI 0.30-1.82). a post-induction chemotherapy increase in IDO activity portended worse Os (hR = 0.43, 95% cI 0.19-0.95, p = 0.037) and pFs (hR = 0.47, 95% cI 0.22-1.0, p = 0.055). This observed increase in IDO transcription may be a means for tumors to evade immunosurveillance.",

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an aggressive epithelial malignancy that often overexpresses the mRNA coding for IDO. 14 NSCLC has an annual incidence of 1.61 million people worldwide, 15,16 and 83 percent of NSCLC patients will eventually die of their cancer. 16 Locoregionally-advanced NSCLC comprises more than one-third of cases at presentation and is classified as Stage III. 17 Over three quarters of Stage III NSCLC patients are technically or medically inoperable. 18 Chemotherapy and concurrent radiation is the standard therapy for inoperable Stage III NSCLC, but the five year overall survival (OS) remains poor, that is, 20% and 8% for IIIA and IIIB disease, respectively. 19 Such an aggressive malignant phenotype has been hypothesized to stem from an innate resistance of NSCLC to chemotherapy 20,21 and to its ability to evade immunosurveillance. 22,23 However, the role of IDO in mediating immune tolerance in NSCLC is unclear.",

To index the shift in IDO activity after chemotherapy, the differences in Kyn/Trp ratios between Time 0 and Time 1 (\u0394IDO 1 ) and between Time 1 and Time 2 (\u0394IDO 2 ) were calculated. Participants were subdivided into two groups based on the median \u0394IDO value. Using RECIST to define the percentage of response, a non-significant trend was observed between radiologic responses at Time 1 and \u0394IDO 1 (Fig. 5).",

To further assess the influence of outliers, we examined the clinicopathologic features of the six participants displaying the highest Kyn/Trp ratio at Time 0 and Time 1 compared with the rest the cohort.

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first report to serially explore changes in plasma IDO activity during the treatment of Stage III NSCLC patients, as measured by Kyn/Trp ratios. We found that IDO activity was higher in cancer patients than in healthy individuals, consistent with previous observations in lung cancer, 24,25,31 bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell   Fischer's exact p = 0.0003). This difference may reflect a posttranscriptional regulation of IDO. Our study also examined the relationship between changes in IDO activity and disease outcome. Our results suggest that a high increase in IDO activity after chemotherapy is associated with a higher risk of mortality. A possible explanation for our findings is that the expression of IDO by tumor cells may mediate-at least in part-resistance to chemotherapy. 40 Along these lines, it has recently been reported that a subset of NSCLC patients with favorable radiologic responses after chemotherapy exhibit a significant decrease in IDO activity within monocytes as compared with baseline conditions. 41 Tumors may generate a hostile microenvironment that impedes host antitumor immune response. Interestingly, no changes in the expression of IDO by tumor cells was observed in melanoma biopsies at baseline and during regression in response to tremelimumab treatment, 42 suggesting that IDO activity may not be influenced by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibition. Several aspects of our report necessitate a more detailed investigation before firm conclusions can be drawn. Due to a small sample size, our trial was statistically underpowered to detect any significant association between Kyn/Trp ratios and demographic characteristics. Likewise, our patient sample was too small to establish a stepwise dose-effect relationship between IDO activity and clinical outcome. Next, tissues were not available for the immunohistochemical detection of IDO, so we used plasma Kyn/Trp ratios as a convenient surrogate marker for IDO activity. Other studies have used plasma Kyn/Trp ratios as an indirect measure for IDO activity ( Table 3) and these correlate well with immunohistochemical data. 43 However, plasma Kyn/Trp ratios are not a direct measure of IDO activity. In particular, other Trp catabolizing enzymes, including tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase and the IDO splice variant known as IDO2 contribute to Kyn production as well. Moreover, our study did not mandate uniform timing for blood draws. Since plasma Trp levels may vary by as much as 20% in the same subject depending on the distance of the last meal and the diurnal cycle, 44 we acknowledge this as a potential confounder. Nonetheless, plasma Kyn has only minor diurnal variation, 43 and the changes that we observed in Kyn/Trp ratios appeared predominantly attributable to Kyn (Fig. 2). Another drawback of the present study is that correlative immunologic markers, such as FOXP3 expression, CD3 activity, and IFN production were not measured. Additional markers may help to substantiate the putative role of IDO in this patient population. Moreover, conclusions cannot be drawn about the effect of individual chemotherapy agents, which are known to have specific immunomodulatory properties. 45,46 Finally, our calculations were performed without multiple comparison rules. 47 Thus, the possibility exists that the observed associations could stem from family-wise errors. In view of all these limitations, our results should be strictly viewed as exploratory.",

The design of the clinical trial has been previously described. 49 Briefly, our single-arm trial used induction gemcitabine (1 g/m 2 ) on day 1 and day 8 and carboplatin (AUC = 5) on day 1 given at 4-week intervals for two cycles. This was followed by weekly carboplatin (AUC = 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m 2 ) with concurrent conformal radiation (dose = 74 Gy \u00b1 5%) administered over 40 daily fractions. Plasma was collected at baseline (Time 0), after induction at week 9 (Time 1), and after  individual mean concentrations were recorded. The intraassay and day-to-day analytic coefficients of variation were less than 5% for each analyte (Table S1). Statistics. The plasma concentrations of Kyn and Trp, as well as Kyn/Trp ratios approximated a parametric distribution. Therefore, data were presented as means \u00b1 SD. Due to the small sample size, the associations between serum biomarker levels and clinicopathologic variables were evaluated with Wilcoxon ranksum and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Wilcoxon signed rank was used to compare between time points. Correlation was estimated using Spearman's rho. Survival curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. To address the experimental hypothesis, the statistical population was equally divided into \"hig\" and \"low\" patients using the median Kyn/Trp value as pre-specified cut-point. The effects of biomarkers on PFS and OS were evaluated using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and Cox proportionalhazards regression models. All tests performed were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS software (version 8.0). Figures and survival plots were generated using GraphPad Prism \u00ae (version 5.04).",
