Methods: Fifty-eight BRAF V600E metastatic melanoma patients treated with dabrafenib or vemurafenib on clinical trials had pretreatment tumour BRAF V600E protein expression immunohistochemically (IHC) assessed using the BRAF V600E mutant-specific antibody VE1. Sections were examined for staining intensity (score 1-3) and percentage of immunoreactive tumour cells, and from this an immunoreactive score (IRS) was derived (intensity \u00c2 per cent positive/10). The presence of intra-tumoural heterogeneity for BRAF V600E protein expression was also assessed. BRAF V600E expression was correlated with RECIST response, time to best response (TTBR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Expression was generally high (median IRS 28 (range 5-30)) and homogeneous (78%). Expression of mutated protein BRAF V600E as measured by intensity, per cent immunoreactive cells, or IRS did not correlate with RECIST response, TTBR, PFS or OS, including on multivariate analysis. Heterogeneity of staining was seen in 22% of cases and did not correlate with outcome. Conclusion: In the current study population, IHC-measured pre-treatment BRAF V600E protein expression does not predict response or outcome to BRAF inhibitor therapy in BRAF V600E metastatic melanoma patients. Constitutive activating mutations in the BRAF gene occur in B50% of melanomas, of which 70-90% result in a single-amino acid substitution of valine for glutamic acid at residue 600 (V600E)"

The majority of patients have a rapid early response but subsequently progress with a median progression-free interval of 6-7 months (Chapman et al, 2011;Hauschild et al, 2012). No biomarker assessed to date is able to predict the clinical outcome (response, PFS and OS) of patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. Such a marker would not only be of use to guide expectations of outcomes from treatment, but may also assist in the selection of patients who may be more appropriately managed with other therapies (e.g., combined BRAF inhibition with other targeted/immunological drugs) at initial diagnosis, rather than after initial treatment failure.",

Detection of the target protein of the BRAF inhibitor using IHC has a number of advantages over other molecular mutation testing techniques. Not only can it provide a result very quickly utilising a technique readily available in most pathology laboratories, but it also allows accurate determination of BRAF mutation status in specimens containing a very low number of tumour cells and has the advantage of quantification and cellular localisation of the mutated BRAF V600E protein within a lesion.

The selection criteria for the current study included all patients diagnosed with a BRAF V600E mutation via somatic mutation testing, who received a BRAF inhibitor on the abovementioned clinical trials, and had sufficient archival tissue to perform IHC. Patients who did not receive the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of vemurafenib (960 mg BD) or dabrafenib (total daily dose of 300 mg) were excluded. Patients who discontinued therapy before best response were also excluded. Seven non-BRAF V600E patients were selected to serve as controls.

Antibody incubation was followed by standard signal amplification with the Ventana amplifier kit, ultra-Wash, counterstaining with one drop of haematoxylin for 4 min and one drop of bluing reagent for 4 min. For chromogenic detection, ultraView Universal DAB detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems) was used. Subsequently, slides were removed from the immunostainer, washed in water with a drop of dishwashing detergent and mounted. No chromogen was detected when the primary antibody BRAF V600E clone VE1 was omitted.

All immunostained slides were evaluated twice by two independent observers (JSW and RAS) blinded to all clinical, histopathological and mutation data. The BRAF V600E VE1 antibody staining was scored for the percentage of immunoreactive cells. Intensity of staining was judged on a semi-quantitative scale of 0-3 \u00fe : no staining (0), weakly positive staining (1 \u00fe ), moderately positive staining (2 \u00fe ) and strongly positive staining (3 \u00fe ) ( Figure 1A-D). An immunoreactive score (IRS) was derived by multiplying the percentage of positive cells with staining intensity divided by 10 (i.e., IRS potenital range: 0-30). Slides that differed by an IRS of 45 between the two observers were then viewed by both observers together to reach agreement on any discordant scores. Additionally, sections were assessed for homogenous or heterogeneous expression of BRAF V600E protein. Heterogeneous expression was defined as the presence of distinct subpopulations of cells that had an immunoreactive intensity score that differed by greater than one scoring level (e.g., one population of cells with 3 \u00fe and another with 1 \u00fe Figure 3A). Cases not fullfilling the above definition of heterogeneous were classified as homogenous expression. Cases with only isolated single interspersed cells with different intensity scores from the majority of the tumour were scored as homogenous. The slides were assesed for cytoplasmic staining only. Any type of isolated nuclear staining, weak staining of single interspersed cells, or staining of monocytes/macrophages was scored negative. Heavily pigmented areas were avoided. Melanoma cells undergoing early necrosis were excluded, as this has previously been shown to affect the antigenicity of the VE1 epitope (Capper et al, 2011(Capper et al, , 2012Long et al, 2013).",

In addition, the analysis accounted for subsequent active therapies received that may have confounded survival analysis. Furthermore, the IHC technique was standardised and utilised archival paraffin pre-treatment samples. Although we demonstrated that protein expression varied between patients, there was no correlation between the level of mutant BRAF protein expression and response to BRAF inhibitors or survival in treated patients. One possible explanation for this relates to the method of detecting BRAF expression. The concentration of the VE1 antibody used in this study was optimised to maximise the sensitivity and specificity for BRAF V600E protein detection. As a consequence, the vast majority of cases produced a strong degree of staining intensity, which resulted in reduced variation of the staining intensity between the cases. It is unlikely that the use of an alternate scoring systems would produce significant results, as none of the individual scoring parameters (percentage positive and staining intensity) were correlative with any response or outcomes data. An increased dilution of the VE1 antibody may provide a greater separation of those cases with very high expression (albeit at the risk of not detecting any expression in the lower expressing tumours) and requires further assessment as a tool for predicting responses to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Another explanation could be that the heterogeneity in staining signal intensity seen between individual cases is influenced by pre-analytical parameters, for example, tissue handling during and after resection, length of tissue fixation in formaldehyde or tissue storage conditions. Previous studies using the VE1 antibody have shown loss of BRAF V600E expression in pre(semi)-necrotic tissue (Capper et al, 2012). Other techniques to quantify BRAF expression levels, such as RNA expression microarray analysis, RT-PCR or proteomics, may provide improved predictive power.",

Analysis of activity of multiple aspects of cell signalling pathways and processes (e.g., MAPK, PI3K, Wnt, NFKB, apoptotic, cell cycling, tumour microenvironment, immune regulation) may be required to predict the clinical effect of subsequent BRAF inhibition."

Multiple tumours within a patient have been shown to respond heterogenously to BRAF inhibitor treatment (Carlino et al, 2013), therefore future studies that account for intertumoral heterogeneity by assesing multiple patient tumours should be conducted. If a lack of predictive power of the BRAF V600E antibody or additional measures of BRAF protein expression is confirmed, it suggests there may be other strong modulators of BRAF inhibitor response, over and above BRAF V600E protein expression, and these may be readily targeted with drugs. Further research into mutant BRAF protein expression at baseline, during treatment, and upon development of disease progression, as well as a search for other modulators of response to BRAF inhibitors, is therefore likely to be important.",
