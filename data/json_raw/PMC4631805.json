            "text": "Linezolid is an oxazolidinone with potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Linezolid toxicity in patients correlates with the dose and duration of therapy. These toxicities are attributable to the inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Clinically relevant linezolid regimens were simulated in the in vitro hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) system to identify the linezolid therapies that minimize toxicity, maximize antibacterial activity, and prevent drug resistance. Linezolid inhibited mitochondrial proteins in an exposure-dependent manner, with toxicity being driven by trough concentrations. Once-daily linezolid killed M. tuberculosis in an exposure-dependent manner. Further, 300 mg linezolid given every 12 hours generated more bacterial kill but more toxicity than 600 mg linezolid given once daily. None of the regimens prevented linezolid resistance. These findings show that with linezolid monotherapy, a clear tradeoff exists between antibacterial activity and toxicity. By identifying the pharmacokinetic parameters linked with toxicity and antibacterial activity, these data can provide guidance for clinical trials evaluating linezolid in multidrug antituberculosis regimens. IMPORTANCE The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis are a major threat to global public health. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone that is licensed for human use and has demonstrated potent activity against multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis. However, long-term use of linezolid has shown to be toxic in patients, often resulting in thrombocytopenia. We examined therapeutic linezolid regimens in an in vitro model to characterize the exposure-toxicity relationship. The antibacterial activity against M. tuberculosis was also assessed for these regimens, including the amplification or suppression of resistant mutant subpopulations by the chosen regimen. Higher exposures of linezolid resulted in greater antibacterial activity, but with more toxicity and, for some regimens, increased resistant mutant subpopulation amplification, illustrating the trade-off between activity and toxicity. These findings can provide valuable insight for designing optimal dosage regimens for linezolid that are part of the long combination courses used to treat multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis.",

A major objective of this current project was to characterize the exposure-mitochondrial toxicity relationship for linezolid. To that end, we employed a human myeloid leukemia cell line with platelet properties (K562 cells) and exposed them to various concentrations of linezolid, simulating pharmacokinetic profiles that would be achieved in a patient receiving this antibiotic. K562 cells have been used previously to evaluate mitochondrial toxicity related to oxazolidinone therapy (6). K562 cells were then evaluated for mitochondrial toxicity by screening for known toxicity biomarkers, including synthesis of proteins involved with energy metabolism, disruption of ATP production, and altered apoptosis. These different uses of the HFIM give us the ability to relate exposure to both antimicrobial effect and drug concentration-driven mitochondrial toxicity.",

Disruption of cellular energy metabolism was determined by quantifying oxidativephosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein complexes 1, 3, 4, and 5 and measuring ATP production. Linezolid therapy had little effect on the protein synthesis of OXPHOS complex 1, 3, or 5 proteins ( Fig. 2A, B, and D). In contrast, OXPHOS complex 4 proteins were markedly inhibited in the linezolid treatment arms relative to the no-treatment control, and protein levels were suppressed in a clearly exposure-dependent manner for the once-daily (q24h) regimens ( Fig. 2C). At day 9 (when maximal protein inhibition was observed), complex 4 protein levels were 36.36% for the 342-mg q24h regimen, 33.33% for the 600-mg q24h regimen, 15.15% for the 858-mg q24h regimen, and 9.09% for the 1,116-mg q24h regimen relative to the no-treatment control arm (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the twice-daily regimen (300 mg q12h) resulted in the lowest levels of complex 4 proteins (6.06% relative to the notreatment control at day 9), indicating that mitochondrial protein synthesis is sensitive to linezolid dosing interval. Cellular ATP production was not influenced by linezolid, as an exposureresponse relationship was not observed over time for linezolidtreated K562 cells (Fig. 3A). Finally, mitochondrial toxicity was evaluated by assessing the induction of apoptosis (a mitochondrial toxicity biomarker) in K562 cells treated with linezolid by measuring caspase 3 activation. Caspase 3 activity levels increased in all treatment arms throughout the duration of the 16-day study (Fig. 3B). The degree of apoptosis did not correlate with different exposures of linezolid ( Fig. 3B), suggesting that linezolid-induced mitochondrial toxicity is not the result of altered apoptosis in treated K562 cells.",

We used this model previously to examine the microbiological endpoints for M. tuberculosis therapy (7-9). In the current project, we developed an approach to link linezolid exposure to an in vitro measure of linezolid-associated toxic effect. One of the most common toxic effects of linezolid and other oxazolidinone therapy is the reduction of the number of hematological cells. In particular, thrombocytopenia and anemia are major problems with long-term oxazolidinone administration (12).",

            "text": "Oxazolidinone toxicity is thought to be mediated by inhibiting mitochondrial protein synthesis (5,6). Others have shown that OXPHOS complex 4 (cytochrome c oxidase) proteins are consistently and significantly decreased in both in vitro and in vivo systems exposed to oxazolidinone therapy (5,6,13). Furthermore, OXPHOS complex 4 levels have been shown to be well below the normal range in patients treated with prolonged courses of linezolid (5,13). These data identify protein complex 4 as a marker for oxazolidinone-related mitochondrial toxicity. To that end, we employed K562 cells, a human erythromyeloblastoid leukemia cell line, and exposed these cells to linezolid concentration-time profiles similar to that seen in humans using the HFIM system. We sampled the system over time and assayed for OXPHOS protein complexes 1 (NADH dehydrogenase), 3 (cytochrome c reductase), 4 (cytochrome c oxidase), and 5 (ATP synthase). OXPHOS complex 2 proteins (succinate dehydrogenase) have been previously shown to not be altered in the presence of linezolid (5), as these protein subunits are mainly encoded by nuclear DNA (14). Thus, we did not assess OXPHOS complex 2 protein levels as part of this investigation. It was our hypothesis that only the complex 4 proteins would yield a clear exposure-response relationship. In Fig. 2, it is obvious that only complex 4 demonstrates a definite exposure-response with a range of linezolid exposures. We calculated the AUC OXPHOS4 as an integrated measure of the toxic effect of linezolid. The results, seen in Fig. 4, indicate that an inhibitory sigmoid-E max model describes the data very well. We had employed two measures of exposure as the independent variable, the 24-h AUC of linezolid and the linezolid trough concentration. In the experiment, we examined 5 linezolid exposures plus a notreatment control. Four of the 5 linezolid exposures were administered daily. For the daily exposures, we evaluated the mean exposure from a 600-mg linezolid dose, as well as \u03e91 standard deviation (mean 24-h AUC exposure equivalent to 858 mg), \u03e92 SD (1,116-mg equivalent), and \u03ea1 SD (342-mg equivalent). Additionally, we examined two different dosing intervals for the mean exposure of a 600-mg daily dose, administered either once daily or as 300 mg q12h. As seen in Fig. 4A, when AUC is the independent variable, all the daily exposures are well described by the mathematical model, but the q12h administration results in more toxicity than suggested by the model. When trough concentrations are employed as the independent variable, the model is more predictive of the results. We conclude that the effect of linezolid on OXPHOS complex 4 proteins is most closely linked to trough concentrations. This finding has been seen in clinical trials as well (15,16).",

Conversely, the \u03ea1 SD (342-mg equivalents) kills substantially less (~1.1 log 10 CFU/ml) than the mean exposure (maximum kill of 0.7 log 10 CFU/ml for the \u03ea1 SD exposure compared to 1.8 log 10 CFU/ml for the mean exposure).

Somewhat to our surprise, the 300-mg-equivalent exposure given q12h resulted in significantly better M. tuberculosis kill than 600 mg daily, indicating that trough concentrations (relative to the MIC) were driving M. tuberculosis kill. A similar finding was observed by Wallis et al. (17). As described above, however, the price is one of toxicity. This is important for design and interpretation of early bactericidal activity (EBA) trials for oxazolidinones. A 14-day EBA study of linezolid may demonstrate maximal killing activity for a twice-daily regimen of linezolid compared with daily dosing of the same total amount. Such a result must be balanced by the increased toxicity that will result from this dosing interval and the fact that the toxicity will not be evident clinically until after 14 days of treatment. We have noted in other studies evaluating oxazolidinone pharmacodynamics (18) that the improved bacterial kill with twice-daily dosing is seen only with monotherapy and that the advantage is abrogated in the face of adequate combination chemotherapy. Also, for the advantage of better patient adherence to regimen or ease of directly observed therapy, it is likely that a daily regimen will be optimal.",

The mean exposure actually drives the greatest resistance emergence, followed by the \u03ea1 SD exposure. The \u03e91 and \u03e92 SD exposures have considerably less resistant subpopulation amplification at the end of the third week, but both are still considerably above baseline. The reason for this is shown in Fig. 6. The data describe a nonmonotonic function, which our laboratory has described as an inverted \"U\" (11). At lower exposures, there is some, but not maximal, resistant subpopulation amplification. As greater pressure is exerted, there is more selective pressure, and the resistance amplification increases to a maximum. At yet-higher exposures, some control is exerted over the less-susceptible subpopulation, and its numbers decline from the maximum. In this instance, even the \u03e92-SD exposure did not fully control the less-susceptible subpopulation amplification. Consequently, increasing exposure that would partially control the resistance amplification would result in considerable more toxicity with higher linezolid doses. In addition, linezolid (and other oxazolidinones) will be given as part of combination chemotherapy, where there will be a much greater likelihood of controlling resistance amplification, as long as there is sufficient consideration given to the exposures for the other drug(s) in the combination.",

The exposure-responses for M. tuberculosis kill and toxicity show a clear trade-off with increasing dosage. The magnitude of the M. tuberculosis kill for \u03ea1 SD exposure is likely to be suboptimal for many patients. The higher exposures (\u03e91 and \u03e92 SD) induce a rapid increase in the measure of toxicity examined here. Therefore, if linezolid is to be incorporated into a multidrug regimen in a phase II study, doses slightly smaller and slightly larger than 600 mg (e.g., perhaps 450 and 900 mg) should be examined. However, no 450-mg dosing is available, so a 300-mg/day regimen might be considered. Several centers with experience in MDR treatment now initiate therapy with 300 mg/day. In addition, studies of initial dosing with 900 or 600 mg/day should allow dose reductions to be made when exposure-related toxicities are detected. While the amplification of a less susceptible subpopulation is worrisome, if linezolid is included in a robust regimen (i.e., not added as a single agent to a failing regimen), there is a high likelihood of protection from resistance emergence. We are currently conducting studies evaluating q24h dosing intervals of linezolid in combination with moxifloxacin to determine relationships to toxicity and antimicrobial activity.",

A detailed description of the HFIM system is found elsewhere (7,9,10,19,20). For these studies, the extracapillary space (ECS) of six polysulfone hollow-fiber cartridges (FiberCellSystems, Frederick, MD) were inoculated with 5 \u03eb 10 6 K562 cells. Linezolid was administered into five cartridges as a 1-h infusion via computer-controlled syringe pumps to simulate the free (non-protein-bound)-drug 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) that is associated with the mean freedrug plasma AUC of linezolid at steady state after oral dosing at 600 mg daily (q24h), one standard deviation above the mean free 24-h-AUC exposure (858-mg mean equivalent exposure q24h), two standard deviations above the mean free 24-h-AUC exposure (1,116-mg mean equivalent exposure q24h), and one standard deviation below the mean free 24-h-AUC exposure (342-mg mean equivalent exposure q24h). The fifth cartridge received linezolid as the mean free 24-h AUC exposure for 300 mg administered twice daily (q12h). Finally, one cartridge did not receive drug treatment and served as a no-treatment control. Linezolid containing medium was isovolumetrically replaced with drug-free medium to simulate the mean clinical half-life of 4.26 h. Human pharmacokinetic parameters for linezolid were obtained from the Zyvox package insert (21).",

Cell pellets were lysed using the cell extraction buffer provided with the cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) human profiling enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and total cellular protein concentration was determined for each sample using a Thermo Scientific Pierce bincinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Cell lysates were assessed for energy metabolism disruption and altered apoptosis, two biomarkers of mitochondrial toxicity. Energy metabolism disruption was evaluated by quantifying oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein complexes using a NADH dehydrogenase (complex 1) human profiling ELISA kit (Abcam), a cytochrome c reductase (complex 3) human profiling ELISA kit (Abcam), a cytochrome c oxidase (complex 4) human profiling ELISA kit (Abcam), and an ATP synthase (complex 5) human profiling ELISA kit (Abcam). Because OX-PHOS complex 2 (succinate dehydrogenase) protein subunits are encoded mainly by nuclear DNA (14) and have been shown to not be altered in the presence of linezolid (5), we did not assess these protein levels to conserve cell lysates for additional assays. Energy metabolism disruption of cell lysates was also evaluated by measuring total ATP production using a colorimetric ATP assay kit (Abcam). Finally, the mitochondrial toxicity marker of altered apoptosis was examined by measuring the increase in caspase 3 activation using a colorimetric assay (Abcam) as per the manufacturer's instructions.",
