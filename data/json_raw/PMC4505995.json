Patients and Methods: Thirty-two preterm infants were assigned randomly into three groups. One intervention group received prefeeding oral stimulation program and the other received non-nutritive sucking stimulation, while the control group received a sham intervention. Gestational age of infants was calculated during 1, 4 and 8 oral feeding and discharge time from NICU. The infants' weights were measured weekly from birth and at discharge time. Results: Mean gestational age on 8 time oral feeding per day, in 3 groups was not significant (P = 0.282). Although NNS and pre-feeding oral stimulation groups has fulfilled this criterion 7.55 and 6.07 days sooner than the control group, respectively (a result which is of great clinical and economic importance), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Weight gaining at discharge time in NNS group was significantly higher than control and pre-feeding oral stimulation groups (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This study revealed that pre-feeding oral stimulation and NNS programs both were effective on oral feeding skills and weight gaining of the immature newborns. Yet, it seems that NNS program was more effective than pre-feeding oral stimulation on weight gaining.",

These difficulties may negatively affect attainment of independent oral feeding and lead to prolonged hospital stay, family stress, long-term health problems and financial costs (7,8). Caregivers and speech language pathologists that work in the NICUs may use various oral stimulation techniques to facilitate oral feeding of preterm infants (9). NNS and pre-feeding oral stimulation are among the most common stimulation techniques in use. These interventions have been proved to be beneficial for oral feeding skills, attainment of full oral feeding, weight gaining and reducing the length of hospital stay (10,11). Due to a lack of empirical evidence, caregivers in NICU, while aware of the feeding difficulties of these infants, are confused about the kind of intervention which is more effective.",

Gestational age is the common term used from the first day of the woman's last menstrual cycle to the current date. Infants were excluded if they had congenital anomalies, chronic medical complications, asphyxia, third or fourth degree intracranial hemorrhages, necrotizing enterocolitis, metabolic disorders, genetic syndromes, oral-motor defects, neurological disorders, umbilical catheter, medication (aminophylin, analgesic), intra uterine growth pattern documented by a neonatologist. The study was performed between January and June 2012.

This intervention delivered by one speech therapist who was blinding to research and was performed through introduction of the little finger in infant's oral cavity to gently stroke the palate to elicit a suck. NNS stimuli were started during initial 5 minutes of tube feeding and were administered for 10 consecutive days. Details of the program can be found in Harding et al. study (12). Pre-feeding oral stimulation was performed by the same speech therapist. The oral stimulation program consisted of once daily stroking of cheeks, gums and tongue and followed by 3 minutes of non-nutritive sucking for 15 minutes. The exact stimulation program can be found in Fucile et al. study (13). The control group received sham intervention. For this group, the same speech therapist placing her hands in the incubator without touching the infant for 15 minutes and 10 consecutive days.

However, which the intervention is most effective, is not yet understood. This study continued to confirm the benefits of oral stimuli techniques applied to preterm infants and to determine which of them is most effective. The results of our study indicated that the NNS and pre-feeding oral stimulation program had a beneficial effect on the time needed to attainment to different stage of oral feeding and independent oral feeding. The preterm infants in NNS and pre-feeding oral stimulation groups reached 7.55 and 6.07 days sooner than control group to these criteria. Therefore in term of performance in oral feeding, NNS program seemed to be more beneficial than pre-feeding oral stimulation and pre-feeding oral stimulation was more fruitful than shame intervention. Although statistically not significant, our results were similar to Lessen et al. (14), Fucile et al. (13), Rocha et al. (15), who confirmed the beneficial effects of two interventions in attainment to oral feeding (a result which is of great clinical and economic importance). Also several studies did not find any improvement in independent oral feeding (10,16). These differences may result from different administrations of stimulation protocol or small sample size that affected the achievement of statistical significance. Our finding suggested that NNS program compared to pre-feeding oral stimulation program improved weight gaining at discharge time. These results was in contrast to the study from Lyu et al. (17) and in line with those of Bernbaum et al. (18). This difference may be explained by the different method used by these studies. In general newborns in NNS and pre-feeding oral stimulation groups discharged sooner than control group. This findings (although not statistically significant) agree with Fucile et al. (19) and is in contrast to previous studies, which reported that oral stimulation decreased length of hospital stay (15,20). Our study had several power and weakness. For example, medical events and lack of exact protocol for discharge may lead prolonged the length of hospital stay. The implementation of specific protocol for discharge may have allowed for better discrimination between groups and reduce these weakness.",

Also, we have demonstrated that both NNS and pre-feeding oral stimulation may contribute to the improvement of independent oral feeding. Since these interventions have beneficial effects on preterm infants weight gaining and independent oral feeding, we offer the use of both interventions in NICU. Furthermore, NNS is more effective on weight gain. We may further propose that caregivers and speech language pathologist in NICU primarily use NNS because of its simplicity and safety for using by parents and NICU staff.",
