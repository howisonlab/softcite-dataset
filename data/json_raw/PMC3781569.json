            "text": "OBJECTIVEdTo examine the associations of maternal gestational glucose tolerance with offspring body composition in late childhood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdAmong 958 women in the prebirth cohort Project Viva, glucose tolerance was assessed in the second trimester by nonfasting 50-g 1-h glucose challenge test (GCT), followed if abnormal by fasting 100-g 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). We categorized women as normoglycemic (83.3%) if GCT was #140 mg/dL, isolated hyperglycemia (9.1%) if GCT was abnormal but OGTT normal, intermediate glucose intolerance (IGI) (3.3%) if there was one abnormal value on OGTT, or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (4.5%) if there were two or more abnormal OGTT values. Using multivariable linear regression, we examined adjusted associations of glucose tolerance with offspring overall (N = 958) and central (N = 760) adiposity and body composition using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measured at the school-age visit (95 6 10 months). RESULTSdCompared with that in the male offspring of normoglycemic mothers, DXA fat mass was higher in male offspring of GDM mothers (1.89 kg [95% CI 0.33-3.45]) but not in male offspring of mothers with IGI (0.06 kg [21.45 to 1.57]). DXA trunk-to-peripheral fat mass, a measure of central adiposity, was also somewhat higher in male offspring of GDM mothers (0.04 [20.01 to 0.09]). In girls, DXA fat mass was higher in offspring of mothers with IGI (2.23 kg [0.12-4.34]) but not GDM (21.25 kg [23.13 to 0.63]). We showed no association of gestational glucose tolerance with DXA lean mass. CONCLUSIONSdIn this study, only male offspring of GDM mothers manifested increased adiposity, whereas only female offspring of mothers with IGI did so. Sex differences in glycemic sensitivity may explain these findings.",

Heavier mothers are more likely to exhibit hyperglycemia during pregnancy than are normal-weight mothers. Because GDM is associated with both higher birth weight and increased fetal adiposity (2) and because birth weight is directly associated with later obesity, it has been postulated that hyperglycemic intrauterine environment may program the fetus via metabolic changes in the child (3,4).",

One reason is that many studies did not adjust for maternal prepregnancy adiposity, which itself is a major determinant of both GDM and offspring adiposity. In their review, Philipps et al. (5) reported that in offspring of mothers with diabetes (all types of diabetes combined vs. no diabetes), the unadjusted mean BMI z score was 0.28 higher (95% CI 0.09-0.47) but that the z score was only 0.07 higher (20.15 to 0.28) after adjustment for maternal prepregnancy BMI.",

Indeed, we previously reported that 3-year-old children of mothers with GDM had greater adiposity than normoglycemic mothers when it was assessed by the sum of skinfold thicknesses but not by BMI (7). Two studies reported results of the association of GDM exposure with body composition measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or magnetic resonance imaging in school-aged children. Chandler-Laney et al. (8) showed that maternal glucose concentration during pregnancy was positively associated with both fat and lean mass as measured by DXA in children aged 5-10 years (8). However, these results were not adjusted for maternal BMI. Crume et al. (9) reported that exposure to maternal GDM was associated with more subcutaneous abdominal fat (1 34.7 cm 2 , P = 0.01) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging in children aged 6-13 years, but adjustment for maternal prepregnancy BMI substantially attenuated the association (1 22.4 cm 2 , P = 0.10).",

Obstetric clinicians routinely screened all women for GDM at 26-28 weeks of gestation with a nonfasting oral glucose challenge test (GCT), in which venous blood was sampled 1 h after a 50-g oral glucose load. If the blood glucose exceeded 140 mg/dL, the clinician referred the woman for a fasting 3-h 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Abnormal OGTT results were a blood glucose .95 mg/dL at baseline, .180 mg/dL at 1 h, .155 mg/dL at 2 h, or .140 mg/dL at 3 h (17). We categorized women with two or more abnormal values on the OGTT as having GDM; those with one abnormal value on the OGTT as having an intermediate glucose intolerance (IGI) previously called impaired glucose tolerance 7; those with an abnormal GCT but a normal OGTT as having isolated hyperglycemia (IH); and the remaining women as having normal glucose tolerance. Those who were diagnosed with GDM were typically followed by a nutritionist, instructed to check their fasting blood glucose daily, and treated with diet and in some cases insulin (7). Mothers with IGI or IH did not have any further screening and were managed in the same way as women with normal GCT results. Outcomes: child overall adiposity, fat, and lean mass. During the in-person school-age visit, trained research assistants measured children's weights (TBF-300A; Tanita, Arlington Heights, IL) and heights (calibrated stadiometer; Shorr Productions, Olney, MD). We calculated age-and sex-specific BMI percentiles and z scores using U.S. national reference data (18). The research staff measured subscapular (SS) and triceps (TR) skinfold thicknesses using Holtain calipers (Holtain, Crosswell, U.K.) and calculated the sum (SS+TR) and the ratio (SS/TR) of skinfolds. BMI z score and SS+TR represent overall adiposity, whereas SS/TR is a measure of central or truncal adiposity (19). To measure waist circumference, we used the method used in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (20). For each measurement, the measuring tape was positioned parallel to the floor with the participant standingdabdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, and feet togetherdand facing the observer with the waist exposed (21). We measured waist circumference just above the right iliac crest at the midaxillary line to the nearest 0.1 cm using a Hoechstmass measuring tape (Hoechstmass Balzer, Sulzbach, Germany). Research assistants followed standardized techniques and participated in biannual in-service training to ensure measurement validity (IJ Shorr; Shorr Productions) (22). Inter-and intrarater errors for skinfold measurements were within published reference ranges for all measurements (23).",

During pregnancy and in late childhood, using a combination of questionnaires and interviews, we obtained information about maternal age, race/ ethnicity, education, parity, smoking during pregnancy, marital status, and household income. We collected information from prenatal medical records on serial pregnancy weights and blood pressure readings and infant birth weight and delivery date. Mothers reported their prepregnancy weight and height and the paternal weight and height. We calculated gestational weight gain as the difference between prepregnancy weight and the last clinically recorded weight before delivery. We derived gestational age from the last menstrual period or from the second trimester ultrasound if the two estimates differed by .10 days. Based on U.S. national natality data, we determined sexspecific birth weight for gestational age z scores (27).",

Male placentas are smaller than those of female fetuses at any given birth weight (30). Male placentas are also more efficient; at any placental weight, male fetuses tend to be heavier. This can result in less reserve capacity in the male fetus in the presence of a stressful event (33). In case of shortage of key nutrients, male fetuses attempt to compensate, more or less successfully, by expanding their placental surface in late gestation (30). In utero, boys seem more responsive to the mother's current diet and metabolism than girls, who appear more influenced by their mother's lifetime nutrition and metabolism (30,34). As a consequence, male fetuses may be more vulnerable to variations in nutrient intake or transfer during pregnancy. In contrast, female fetuses seem to take a more cautious route that favors survival. They grow more slowly in weight and length and they have a larger placenta for a given birth weight than boys (30). Female neonates also have higher insulin concentrations at birth and higher adiposity for a given birth weight, indicating that they allocate more resources toward fat mass than do male fetuses (35). These characteristics may result in differential sensitivity to hyperglycemia in pregnancy and in differential long-term programming in male and female fetuses. Ricart et al. (36) showed at birth in .9,000 newborns that GDM was a predictor of macrosomia only in males. In 84 newborns born to GDM mothers, maternal fasting blood glucose was the major predictor of adiposity measured by air displacement plethysmography in male newborns but had little effect on adiposity in females. Conversely, maternal BMI was the primary predictor in female newborns but not in males (37). A recent report from a large randomized controlled trial of treatment for mild GDM by the U.S. Maternal-Fetal Medicine Network reported a greater reduction of birth weight and fat mass in male than in female neonates (38). Studies also reported sexspecific associations with measures of adiposity in childhood. A study of .600 French children born to GDM mothers paired with children born to non-GDM mothers (i.e., normoglycemic, IH, and IGI combined) showed that only the male offspring of GDM mothers had a higher BMI at 5-7 years after adjustment for prepregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, caloric intake, physical activity, screen time, and a range of sociodemographic variables (14). In contrast to our findings, Krishnaveni et al. (15) showed Figure 1dAdjusted means (95% CI) of total fat and trunk-to-peripheral fat ratio, by DXA, according to maternal glucose tolerance and child sex.

Unfortunately, many earlier studies did not separately examine offspring of IGI mothers, but this group has recently received enhanced attention after results of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study that showed a continuous association of maternal glycemia during pregnancy with offspring adiposity at birth (2). In a sample of .9,000 mother-child pairs, Hillier et al. (40) showed that offspring of IGI mothers, but not IH, had a higher risk of childhood overweight than offspring of normoglycemic mothers, but they did not mention any sex-specific associations. The female-only associations that we show in offspring of IGI mothers have never been reported before. While we did not have data on degree of control or adherence to treatment in women with GDM in this study, a possible explanation for the observed difference is that exposure of the fetuses to excess glycemia may differ in intensity and timing among those whose mothers have IGI versus GDM. In addition, sensitivity may also differ in males and females, which may result in differential long-term programming. However, our results should be tempered by the fact that if we could have used the recent criteria recommended by the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups, a large proportion of the women diagnosed with IGI in our study would have been diagnosed with GDM (41). We did not find an effect of gestational glucose tolerance on fat-free mass in boys or girls.",

Indeed, it has been shown that the metabolic implications of impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy vary in relation to the timing of the abnormal glucose value from the diagnostic OGTT (43). Another limitation is attrition. It is possible that loss to follow-up could have introduced bias, but many baseline variables were similar in the study sample and in those excluded.
