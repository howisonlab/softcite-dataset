            "text": "Low dose CT (LDCT) for lung cancer screening is an evidence-based, guideline recommended, and Medicare approved test but uptake requires further study. We therefore conducted patient and provider surveys to elucidate factors associated with utilization. Patients referred for LDCT at an academic medical center were questioned about their attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs on lung cancer screening. Adherent patients were defined as those who met screening eligibility criteria and completed a LDCT. Referring primary care providers within this same medical system were surveyed in parallel about their practice patterns, attitudes, knowledge and beliefs about screening. Eighty patients responded (36%), 48 of whom were adherent. Among responders, non-Hispanic patients (p = 0.04) were more adherent. Adherent respondents believed that CT technology is accurate and early detection is useful, and they trusted their providers. A majority of non-adherent patients (79%) self-reported an intention to obtain a LDCT in the future. Of 36 of 87 (41%) responding providers, only 31% knew the correct lung cancer screening eligibility criteria, which led to a 37% inappropriate referral rate from 2013 to 2015. Yet, 75% had initiated lung cancer screening discussions, 64% thought screening was at least moderately effective, and 82% were interested in learning more of the 33 providers responding to these questions. Overall, patients were motivated and providers engaged to screen for lung cancer by LDCT. Non-adherent patient \"procrastinators\" were motivated to undergo screening in the future. Additional follow through on non-adherence may enhance screening uptake, and raising awareness for screening eligibility through provider education may reduce inappropriate referrals.",

The NLST was a large, multi-center, randomized trial that reported a 20% reduction in the risk of lung cancer-specific mortality for three annual low dose CT (LDCT) screens among active or prior heavy smokers aged 55 to 74 years old. Based on this result, LDCT lung cancer screening for patients at high risk of lung cancer is now an evidence-based recommendation by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and a covered test by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).",

Despite national guideline recommendations for lung cancer screening with LDCT, the adoption of this evidenced-based screening at the national policy level, endorsements by multiple professional societies, and studies demonstrating cost-effectiveness (Black et al., 2014), uptake in many academic centers which is governed by physician practices and patient volitionstill remains low in the initial years following the publication of the NLST (Hoffman et al., 2015;Lewis et al., 2015). Since the uptake of LDCT and best practices to drive its adoption remains to be determined, we sought to investigate LDCT screening uptake within an academic setting by surveying patients and providers on their attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs regarding LDCT. Our goal was to identify facilitators and barriers to lung cancer screening within our medical center for improved adoption moving forward.",

LDCT adherent patients reported feeling that CT technology is accurate, early detection is useful, and trusting their providers as the most common reasons to undergo LDCT. They also reported wanting to know if they might have cancer as an important reason to adhere. Twenty-two of 28 patients (79%) who had not had their prescribed LCDT reported wanted to do one in the future. Overall, the attitudes between those who were adherent and patient \"procrastinators\" were very similar. Additionally, those who quit smoking or who smoke less than they used to were more adherent with a prescribed LDCT (p = 0.03).

We also had a small number of underrepresented minorities, who are known to have different attitudes towards lung cancer screening (Jonnalagadda et al., 2012). Last, both surveys had a modest response rate (58% for LDCT eligible patients and 36% for providers). Although within the range of the previous studies (20-71%) (Lewis et al., 2015;Cataldo, 2016;Klabunde et al., 2012;Zeliadt et al., 2015), response rate bias cannot be excluded. Selection bias should be minimal since respondents and non-respondents had similar characteristics and LDCT adherence rates (Table 3).",

A study of more socio-economically diverse sample populations for patients and providers is warranted to allow for a broader interpretation of these results. These data will ultimately help improve the uptake and utilization of LDCT screening to lower lung cancer mortality in high risk populations.",
