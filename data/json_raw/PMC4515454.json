            "text": "Internal snapping hip syndrome is a condition produced by the iliopsoas tendon snapping over the iliopectineal eminence or the femoral head. This condition is caused by hypertrophy or hyperactivity of the iliocapsularis, chronic inflammation of the iliopsoas tendon and bursa, overhanging acetabular cup, abnormal angulation of the tendon, a large femoral head, and high femoral anteversion. 1-4) Internal snapping hip syndrome may occur without pain in up to 10% of the general population. 5) However, when symptomatic, surgical treatment may be indicated. Open surgical release of the iliopsoas has been reported by several authors for the treatment of internal snapping hip syndrome. 1,6,7) The approach can be moderately successful, although a 40% complication rate was reported. 8) Advances in arthroscopic techniques and instruments have included arthroscopic iliopsoas tendon release. 9-12) It is our experience that patients with symptomatic internal snapping hip frequently have concomitant hip pathology including femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears. However, most reported studies have focused on the surgical technique and the result of focused isolated treatment of internal snapping hip. The purpose of this study was to evaluate concomitant hip pathology in patients with painful internal snapping hip and the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic iliopsoas tendon surgery after a minimum follow-up of 2 years. The study hypothesis is that arthroscopic iliopsoas tendon release can provide good clinical outcomes in patients with painful internal snapping hip and concomitant",

The indications for surgery were an audible and painful popping sound of the iliopsoas attachment area and intractable pain after preoperative conservative treatment, manifest as limitation of patient's activity, physical therapy, and/ or the need for medications and injections for at least 12 weeks. On physical examination, all patients had a painful range of motion and a positive impingement test (flexion, adduction, and internal rotation). Preoperative imaging included plain radiographs (pelvis anteroposterior and frog leg) and computed tomography arthrogram or magnetic resonance arthrogram to detect bony impingement and labral lesons. Patients who had undergone previous hip surgery, and who had avascular necrosis, rheumatologic disorder, and arthritis more severe than Tonnis grade 2 were excluded.",

The arthroscope was initially inserted through a posterolateral portal in all cases. Anterior and anterolateral portals were used as necessary. Complete inspection of the central compartment was performed, with care to evaluate for the presence of injury to any part of the labrum, articular cartilage damage, or pincer lesion. In cases with a tear of the labrum, the torn portion was debrided using the shaver or reattached using suture anchors. The traction was released and the peripheral compartment entered via anterolateral and anterior portals with the hip in 30\u00b0 flexion to open the space anteriorly over the hip. For exposure of the tendinous portion of the iliopsoas, further capsulotomy was made anterior to the labral injury using the shaver or radiofrequency ablation device. A 30\u00b0 arthroscope was introduced into the anterolateral portal aiming caudally and set on the femoral head-neck junction. With the arthroscope pointing toward the anterior capsule, an electrocautery device was introduced from the anterior portal. An 8-mm transverse capsulotomy was made just lateral to the medial synovial fold and just proximal to the zona orbicularis anteriorly, directly under the iliopsoas tendon. 13) Through this capsular window, the tendinous portion of the iliopsoas could be visualized (Fig. 1). The shaver was used to peel any adherent portions of the iliopsoas off of the capsule. The tendinous portion of the iliopsoas was then incised through an anterior portal from medial to lateral using arthroscopic electrocautery (Fig. 2). Careful attention was paid to avoid damage to any of the nearby neurovascular structures (Supplement 1 ). The surgery was completed with a thorough inspection of the peripheral compartment with care to note the presence of a cam lesion or capsular-sided labral abnormality. The operation was completed by joint lavage and injection with a local anesthetic. Postoperatively, all patients followed a standardized rehabilitation program.",

However, most of the reported studies have focused on the surgical techniques used and the clinical outcomes of isolated internal snapping. [9][10][11]17) This study was done to evaluate clinical outcomes after combined arthroscopic iliopsoas tendon release and other arthroscopic procedures in patients with internal snapping and other intracapsular pathologies. Twenty-four of 25 patients experienced disappearance of the snapping sound and 22 patients (88%) had scores indicating excellent and good responses over the minimal 2-year follow-up period (Table 2). In 2006, Ilizaliturri et al. 10) performed arthroscopic release of the iliopsoas tendon in 7 hips. They reported that the snapping symptoms disappeared in all patients over the average 21-month follow-up period and significant loss of flexion strength was present after surgery but had improved by 8 weeks. In 2009, Ilizaliturri et al. 11) performed a prospective randomized study of two different techniques for endoscopic iliopsoas tendon release in 19 patients. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) scores in both groups improved without complications. Flanum et al. 18) reported all 6 patients in the case series reported no recurrence of their snapping or pain at the last follow-up. Our findings are consistent with those of the previous three studies.",

However, in this study, all patients had combined internal hip pathologies such as labral tear (6 patients) and femoroacetabular impingements (19 patients). Domb et al. 12) performed arthroscopic iliopsoas tendon release in 25 patients. They observed anterior labral tears at the 3 o' clock area and suggested that iliopsoas impingement is one of the causes of labral tear in the hip. Fabricant el al. 17) evaluated the clinical outcomes of 67 patients with internal snapping hip who underwent arthroscopic psoas tendon lengthening. Thirty-seven of these patients had combined structural pathologies. Also, increased femoral anteversion was reported as a risk factor for inferior clinical outcomes after arthroscopic lengthening for symptomatic internal snapping hip. Patients with internal snapping hip might have combined hip pathologies. However, during open surgical treatment of internal snapping hip, it may be difficult to evaluate and treat combined internal hip pathologies such as structural bony abnormalities, labral tear, and femoral anteversion. 12,17) Recently, Khan et al. 19) performed a systemic review using 11 eligible studies. They reported that arthroscopic surgery for internal snapping hip syndrome showed a decreased failure rate, fewer complications, and decreased postoperative pain in comparison with open management. 19) A possible reason for the better outcomes after arthroscopic iliopsoas tendon release is that combined intraartcular hip pathologies can easily be treated during this procedure. We think that clinical outcomes after iliopsoas tendon release might be related to the treatment of combined hip pathologies.",

Others reported that significant loss of flexion strength was present after surgery but improved by 8 weeks. 10) In the present study, all patients who had presented with loss of flexion strength postoperatively showed recovery by week 6 to 10. Therefore, patients should be told about the inevitable loss of flexion strength and the longer rehabilitation period plus the longer period of crutch use that occur after this procedure.",

First, it is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data and no control group was used, it might be hard to know what effect the psoas tendon release had on the overall results. However, we are sure of the reliability of our study because all patients had painful snapping hip and completed the follow-up for the minimum 2-year period. Second, all patients had combined hip pathology. It might be difficult to evaluate the effect of arthroscopic iliopsoas release on internal snapping hip only when there is combined hip pathology. In addition, patients with internal snapping hip should be thoroughly evaluated and a plan made for the treatment of combined pathology such as structural bony abnormalities, labral tear, and femoral anteversion. Dynamic ultrasound is a well-suited, complementary tool for diagnosing snapping hip because of its real-time visualization of the snapping structures. This diagnostic method might be helpful to evaluate painful internal snapping hip. However, dynamic ultrasound technique was not available in this study period.",
