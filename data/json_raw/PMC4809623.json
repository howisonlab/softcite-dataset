            "text": "Cytoplasmic citrate serves as an important regulator of gluconeogenesis and carbon source for de novo lipogenesis in the liver. For this reason, the sodium-coupled citrate transporter (NaCT), a plasma membrane transporter that governs hepatic influx of plasma citrate in human, is being explored as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders. As cytoplasmic citrate also originates from intracellular mitochondria, the relative contribution of these two pathways represents critical information necessary to underwrite confidence in this target. In this work, hepatic influx of plasma citrate was quantified via pharmacokinetic modeling of published clinical data. The influx was then compared to independent literature estimates of intracellular citrate flux in human liver. The results indicate that, under normal conditions, <10% of hepatic citrate originates from plasma. Similar estimates were determined experimentally in mice and rats. This suggests that NaCT inhibition will have a limited impact on hepatic citrate concentrations across species. CPT Pharmacometrics Syst. Pharmacol.

            "text": "The sodium-coupled citrate transporter (NaCT) has been proposed as a therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes. 1 NaCT, coded by gene SLC13A5, is expressed predominately in the plasma membrane of mammalian liver, and at lower levels in the brain and testes. 2 NaCT transports citrate from plasma into the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, where citrate serves as an important precursor of de novo lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis. 2,3 Citrate stimulates de novo lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis by activating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and promoting fructose-1, 6bisphosphase (F-1, 6-BP) production ( Figure 1). [4][5][6] Conversely, citrate has an inhibitory effect on glycolysis by inhibiting phosphofructokinase (PFK). 7 As such, inhibition of NaCT should reduce citrate flux from plasma into the liver and lower cytoplasmic citrate levels, which could, in turn, promote glycolysis and reduce lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis. This hypothesis is supported by rodent studies where SLC13A5 deletion confers protection from age and high-fat diet-induced adiposity and insulin resistance. 1 Whether the effects of NaCT knockout in mice can be translated into humans is unclear, because of speciesspecific differences with respect to substrate-sensitivity 8,9 and cation-dependency. 10 Cross-species translation is fur-ther complicated by the fact that there are at least two other transporters that play a role in citrate homeostasis: low-affinity sodium-dependent dicarboxylate cotransporter (NaDC1) encoded by SLC13A2, and high-affinity sodiumdependent dicarboxylate cotransporter (NaDC3) encoded by SLC13A3. Although NaCT is located primarily in the liver of both humans and mice, its relative importance to hepatic citrate uptake appears to be different across these species. While NaCT is the dominant citrate transporter transcribed in human hepatocytes, NaDC1 and NaDC3 contribute to citrate transport in mouse hepatocytes (in-house data).",

One key question underscoring confidence in rationale is the fractional contribution of NaCT to hepatic citrate concentrations. It is known that there exist at least two sources of citrate in liver: one is the influx of plasma citrate majorly regulated by NaCT, and the other is the output of local tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in mitochondria 2  (Figure 1). In this work, the relative contribution of these two pathways to hepatic citrate was quantified. A model-based analysis was performed using literature pharmacokinetic (PK) data on citrate. The model-derived estimate of hepatic influx was then compared to intracellular citrate flux in the liver reported in the literature. The modeling results suggest that, in humans, although hepatic influx largely determines the rate of citrate clearance from the plasma (i.e., 85%), the rate is small relative to the intracellular flux occurring from the mitochondria as a consequence of the TCA cycle.",

One study using mice infused with 13 C-citrate showed 25% 13 C-citrate enrichment in plasma at steady state, yet only 0.7% 13 C-citrate enrichment was found in the liver. Another study using fasting rats treated with 14 C-citrate demonstrated that fewer 14 C radiolabels were incorporated into lipids extracted from liver than those from kidney or testes. Given that liver is the major organ synthesizing lipids, and lipogenesis occurs in the cytoplasm, the findings suggest that flux of citrate from plasma to the liver contributes minimally to the bulk production of lipids in the liver of fasting rats.",

When the heterogeneity of the studies was taken into consideration, the mixed effect estimate was approximated to 303 g/day with a 95% CI of [119-487] (Figure 3).

            "text": "Citrate PK and hepatic flux in humans In this study, whole body plasma citrate clearance in healthy humans was estimated to be 7.79 mL/min/kg, with a baseline citrate concentration of 0.13 mM. These two parameters combine to give a citrate turnover rate of 20 g/ day, which is consistent with independent literature reports  of 10 g/day determined by Nielsen. 7 As 1 g of citric acid contains 2.5 calories, 24 a turnover of 20 g/day of citrate corresponds to 50 calories daily, indicating a limited calorie exclusion resulting from a complete inhibition of plasma citrate utilization. The citrate intake from a typical diet is less than 10 g per day. 7,25 As such, a significant amount of the citrate found in plasma is provided via endogenous production. The tissues that are known to release citrate include muscle, bone, and prostate. 7,26 Hepatic citrate clearance was found to be 6.6 mL/min/kg, indicating that liver is the predominant organ that metabolizes plasma citrate (i.e., 85% of total clearance). This aligns with prior knowledge that the liver is an important organ involved in citrate metabolism, 27 and with the fact that plasma citrate clearance is substantially decreased in subjects with impaired liver function. 11,12 A portion of the remaining 15% of plasma citrate clearance is likely due, at least in part, to the kidney. This is consistent with the understanding that the kidney also plays a role in citrate homeostasis. [28][29][30] For example, in healthy humans the glomerular filtrate rate of citrate is 4 g per day, with 70-90% reabsorbed at the proximal tubule by active citrate transporters (SLC13A2 and SLC13A3) and only 10-30% remaining in the urine. 31 As a result, the urine excretion of citrate is 0.4-1.2 g/day (i.e., 2-6% of daily citrate turnover). 32,33 However, depending on the metabolic capacity of the kidney, the reabsorbed citrate may or may not circulate back into plasma. If citrate is renally metabolized, it could lead to a net elimination of up to 4 g of citrate daily (20% of daily citrate turnover). Consistent with the physiologic case for the relatively minor role of kidney in human citrate clearance, the pharmacokinetics of citrate are unaffected by impairments in renal function. 13,15 Assuming that NaCT is entirely responsible for the hepatic clearance of citrate, an inhibitor of NaCT is expected to significantly affect circulating citrate concentrations. Simulations from the derived PK model indicate that the assumed level of inhibition will affect both the magnitude and time-course citrate elevations. Maximum steadystate elevations are expected to be approximately sevenfold, with a twofold increase at 87% NaCT inhibition Eq. 6, where fCL NaCT and fi NaCT are the fractional clearance through NaCT and fractional inhibition of NaCT, respectively):",

In addition, the accuracy of technologies used in the estimation of in vivo hepatic citrate flux (e.g., in vivo NMR combined with 13 C-labeling technology, 1 H, 2 H, 13 C MRS, or sampling glutamine through urine PAGN and apoB-100) are still under evaluation. These estimates of in vivo intracellular flux are also determined at the level of whole liver, with no distinction as to subcellular compartmentalization (e.g., cytoplasm vs. mitochondria) which, if available, might lead to a different assessment of the relative importance of the two pathways. In order to get a more direct estimate of the contribution of citrate flux from plasma to the net hepatic citrate concentration, preclinical studies were conducted whereby hepatic enrichment of labeled citrate could be assessed.",

In our studies, hepatic 13 C-citrate enrichment is only 2.8% of that observed in the plasma (i.e., 0.7% in liver vs. 25% in plasma) at steady state. Consistent with our conclusions for human, these results suggest that inhibition of plasma citrate flux would marginally affect hepatic citrate concentrations in mice, as most hepatic citrate seemingly originates from the TCA cycle. Unfortunately, an orthogonal assessment through inhibition of plasma citrate flux is precluded by the lack of selective inhibitors for the predominate hepatic citrate transporters expressed in mice (i.e., SLC13A2 and A3). Furthermore, since NaCT is a relatively minor citrate transporter in mice, the use of specific NaCT inhibitors in mice will likely underestimate the potential effects in humans.",

The total lipids extracted from rat liver contained a lower density of 14 C radioactivity than those from kidney and testes. It is known that liver is the major organ synthesizing total lipids in rats, and its contribution is 37%. 34 In contrast, kidneys contribute only 0.7%, and testes 0.1%. 34 After taking tissue weight into consideration, liver should still contribute about 10-fold more radioactivity than the kidney (3.7%/g liver vs. 0.38%/g kidney in rats). The old numbers were based on human liver and kidney weight (1470 and 308 g, respectively). As we are discussing rat physiology, the numbers are now updated based on rat liver and kidney weight (10 and 1.825 g, respectively). However, in this study the density of radioactivity in liver lipids is only 22% of that in kidney lipids. This finding again suggests that there is a large local pool of citrate in the liver that significantly dilutes the radioactivity from 14 C-citrate. In addition, since lipid synthesis mainly occurs in the cytoplasm, it is highly likely that the influx of plasma citrate contributed minimally to the citrate level in the cytoplasm of rat hepatocytes.",

The specific molecular mechanism behind the metabolic benefits observed in NaCT knockout mice is unclear and further investigations are necessary to determine if the physiological effects can be explained by their exquisite sensitivity to cytoplasmic citrate concentrations.

Male B6/C57 DIO mice (n 5 8) from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) arrived at 17 weeks of age following 12 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD, D12459i with 60% calories from fat). After an additional 3-week HFD acclimation period, the mice were implanted with a jugular vein cannula and allowed 4 days to recover. On day 4, all mice were fasted beginning at 5:00 PM. On day 5, after the overnight fast, mice were reconnected to jugular vein tubing in a disposable cage. U-[ 13 C]-citrate was infused at 1.5 mmol/kg/hr for 5 minutes, followed by 0.15 mmol/kg/hr for 115 minutes. Blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 60, 90, and 120-minute timepoints (n 5 8 at each timepoint). All mice were euthanized at 120 minutes (n 5 8) and livers were immediately harvested. The percentages of 13 C-citrate enrichment were analyzed in both blood and liver samples using mass spectrum.Incorporation of radioactivity of 14 C-citrate into lipids using rats. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n 5 8) at 8 weeks of age and fed a normal chow diet were used in this study. The rats were i.v. dosed with 0.4 mL of 50 mCi/mL 1, 5-[",
