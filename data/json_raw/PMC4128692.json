This study evaluated the antiosteoporotic effects of annattoderived tocotrienol (AnTT) using a testosterone-deficient osteoporotic rat model. Methods: Forty rats were divided randomly into baseline, sham, orchidectomized, AnTT, and testosterone groups. The baseline group was euthanized without undergoing any surgical treatment or intervention. The remaining groups underwent orchidectomy, with the exception of the sham group. AnTT 60 mg/kg/day was given orally to the AnTT group, while the testosterone group received testosterone enanthate 7 mg/kg per week intramuscularly for 8 weeks. Structural changes in trabecular bone at the proximal tibia were examined using microcomputed tomography. Structural and dynamic changes at the distal femur were examined using histomorphometric methods. Serum osteocalcin and C-terminal of type 1 collagen crosslinks were measured. Bone-related gene expression in the distal femur was examined. Results: There were significant degenerative changes in structural indices in the orchidectomized group (P\ue02c0.05), but no significant changes in dynamic indices, bone remodeling markers, or gene expression (P\ue02e0.05) when compared with the sham group. The AnTT group showed significant improvement in structural indices at the femur (P\ue02c0.05) and significantly increased expression of bone formation genes (P\ue02c0.05). Testosterone was more effective than AnTT in preventing degeneration of bone structural indices in the femur and tibia (P\ue02c0.05). Conclusion: AnTT supplementation improves bone health in testosterone-deficient rats by enhancing bone formation. Its potential should be evaluated further by varying the dosage and treatment duration.",

            "text": "Although the prevalence of osteoporosis in men is lower than that in women, 1 male osteoporosis is still regarded as a tremendous health problem. Men with osteoporosis suffer from higher mortality after a fracture when compared with their female counterparts. 2,3 Osteoporotic fractures also cause a substantial financial burden to society and decrease quality of life for patients, 4,5 so should be prevented. The agerelated decrease in testosterone is a major risk factor for male osteoporosis. 6,7 Several pharmacologic antiosteoporotic agents are available on the market, including bisphosphonates, teriparatide, and strontium ranelate, but are not free of side effects. 8 Calcium supplementation with and without vitamin D is commonly prescribed, but has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. 9 This has prompted a search for other agents with the potential to prevent osteoporosis.",

Fujita et al have shown that \u03b1TF promotes fusion of osteoclasts and increases bone resorption, 19 which might interfere with the bone-protective effects of a tocotrienol mixture containing \u03b1TF. However, previous studies have not used molecular techniques, so the bone-protective mechanism of tocotrienol remains unclear.",

They were acclimatized at the local vivarium for one week (room temperature, 12-hour light/dark cycle). The rats were housed singly in plastic cages with free access to tap water and standard rat chow (Gold Coin, Port Klang, Malaysia). They were stratified into five groups using random numbers generated by statistical software. Orchidectomy was performed in the orchidectomized, AnTT, and testosterone groups. A shamoperated group underwent similar surgical treatment but their testes were not removed. The baseline group was sacrificed without undergoing any surgical treatment or intervention. The AnTT group received AnTT daily (60 mg/kg body weight, oral gavage) for 8 weeks, while the other groups received an equal volume of the olive oil vehicle. The testosterone group received weekly testosterone enanthate injections (7 mg/kg body weight, intramuscularly) for 8 weeks while the other groups received an equal volume of the peanut oil vehicle. Treatment was initiated a week after orchidectomy. The weight of each rat was monitored weekly using a digital scale (Tanita Model 1,144, Tokyo, Japan) and recorded to the nearest 1 g. At the end of the treatment period, the rats were euthanized using diethyl ether (HmbG Chemicals \u00ae , Hamburg, Germany), after which their femoral and tibial bones were harvested.

Testosterone inhibited both bone formation (as evidenced by a significant decrease in double-labeled surface and serum osteocalcin level) and bone resorption (as evidenced by a significant decrease in RANKL mRNA expression), so bone remodeling was halted. Tocotrienol uncoupled bone remodeling by promoting bone formation (as evidenced by a significant increase in doublelabeled surface and expression of bone formation genes), with a negligible impact on bone resorption (as indicated by no significant changes in osteoclast-related gene expression). Differences between AnTT and testosterone with regard to the bone-protective mechanism have a significant clinical impact. We showed that testosterone was more effective than AnTT in preserving trabecular structure at the femur and tibia. However, inhibition of bone remodeling by testosterone could lead to accumulation of microfractures, thereby weakening the bone if not repaired via the normal remodeling process. On the other hand, AnTT activated bone formation but had negligible effects on bone resorption, resulting in a net gain of bone, which counteracted the loss of bone mass Notes: b Significant difference versus the sham group; c significant difference versus the orchidectomized group; d significant difference versus the AnTT group.

Since bone remodeling was not suppressed, AnTT would allow repair of microfractures. However, examination of microfractures was outside the scope of the present study. The use of a \u03b4TT-predominant AnTT mixture without any \u03b1TF is a novel approach in the prevention of male osteoporosis, so no comparable studies are available. A previous study by Abdul-Majeed et al showed that supplementing ovariectomized female rats with AnTT 60 mg/kg for 8 weeks prevented adverse changes in femoral trabecular bone due to estrogen deficiency, as evidenced by improvements in cellular and static bone parameters. 21 Bone formation was increased and bone resorption was decreased in the AnTT-treated group in that study, 21 whereas only bone formation was increased in the present study. This discrepancy might be due to sex differences in the response of bone to treatment with AnTT. Many studies had been performed previously using \u03b3TTpredominant palm-derived tocotrienol mixtures containing 20%-30% \u03b1TF to investigate the antiosteoporotic effects of tocotrienol. 10 The majority of these studies found that palmderived tocotrienols at 60 mg/kg body weight were effective in preventing degenerative changes in structural, dynamic, cellular and static indices of bone in osteoporosis induced by estrogen deficiency, [12][13][14] nicotine, 16 and free radicals. 15 In a study using normal rats, isomers of tocotrienol were found to have anabolic effects on bone as evaluated by biomechanical strength testing and histomorphometric evaluation. 23 Hence, the current study showed that AnTT also exerted anabolic effects on bone in male rats with testosterone deficiency.",

In vitro studies by Brooks et al 24 and Ha et al 25 demonstrated that tocotrienol isomers were able to decrease the formation and differentiation of osteoclasts from human CD14+ cells and mouse bone marrow macrophages and the resorption activity of osteoclasts. Ha et al further demonstrated that the antiosteoclastogenic effects of \u03b1TT could be attributed to disruption of RANKL signaling. 25 These observations were supported by several in vivo studies, in which eroded surface and osteoclast surface of trabecular bone were reduced in tocotrienol-supplemented female animals. 21 The present research shows that AnTT supplementation significantly increases the expression of genes related to bone formation (ALPL, COL1\u03b11, and CTNNB1) but does not have a significant influence on expression of genes related to osteoclasts. Although expression of RANKL was decreased in the AnTT group, expression of other genes related to osteoclast function (ACP5, CTSK, and ITGB3) and signaling (NFATC1 and SRC) was not affected. Further, treatment with AnTT decreased expression of PPARG, which is responsible for differentiation of adipocytes, indicating that bone marrow mesenchymal cells were more committed to differentiate into osteoblasts (indicated by marginally higher but not statistically significant RUNX expression in the AnTT group) instead of adipocytes. In view of previous evidence regarding the antiosteoclastogenic effects of tocotrienols, we postulate that the dose used in the current study was sufficient to activate genes for bone formation but not those for bone resorption. It is also possible that the effect of the AnTT mixture on bone remodeling was different from that of single tocotrienol isomers and palm-derived tocotrienol mixtures, whereby the AnTT mixture exerted predominantly anabolic but not antiresorptive effects in bone.",

            "text": "There are several advantages to using an \u03b1TF-free tocotrienol mixture. A study by Fujita et al showed that \u03b1TF stimulated osteoclast fusion and increased bone resorption activity, but other vitamin E isomers did not. 19 Alpha-TF was also shown to compete with other vitamin E isomers to bind with \u03b1TF transport protein, which secretes vitamin E isomers into the circulation, 26 thus reducing the level of tocotrienol isomers beneficial to bone health. This was supported by intervention studies, in which \u03b1TF supplementation decreased circulating levels of other tocopherols and tocotrienols. 27,28 These undesirable characteristics of \u03b1TF might interfere with the bone-protective effects of tocotrienols and subsequently reduce their efficacy. 29 Several limitations need to be considered in interpreting the results of the present study. The affinity of \u03b1TF transport protein for \u03b4TT and \u03b3TT was very low. 26 We did not determine the amount of tocotrienol that reached the circulation or bone. However, previous animal studies have shown that supplementation with tocotrienol 60 mg/kg improves bone quality. 21 Trabecular bone was studied because it is metabolically active and provides a large surface to volume ratio for interaction between soluble factors and bone. 30 Thus, trabecular bone would show a more rapid response than cortical bone when studying compounds that could affect bone. The antiosteoporotic effects of AnTT could be further explored by varying the dose and treatment duration. The dosage and treatment period in the current study were based on those used in an earlier ovariectomized osteoporosis model. 21 This study is novel because the effects of an AnTT mixture with a unique composition of 90% \u03b4TT and 10% \u03b3TT have never been examined before in osteoporosis induced by testosterone deficiency. Previous studies have used palm-derived tocotrienol mixtures and focused on estrogeninduced osteoporosis and other models. The absence of \u03b1TF in the mixture allows the effects of tocotrienols to be studied without undesirable interference. This study characterized the effects of AnTT on gene expression in bone, which has not been done by previous researchers. This allowed a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the bone-protective action of AnTT. A gene expression study was performed using a multiplex platform that reduced errors due to sample processing, dilution, and amplification. The multiplex platform has been reported to have a lower coefficient of variation when compared with the traditional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. 31 ",

These antiosteoporotic effects are attributed to an increase in bone formation activity brought about by increased expression of genes related to bone formation. AnTT protects bone via a different mechanism when compared with testosterone replacement, which inhibits the bone modeling process. Further research of AnTT should be conducted by varying the dose and treatment duration, when examining the antiosteoporotic effects of AnTT in male osteoporosis induced by testosterone deficiency.",
