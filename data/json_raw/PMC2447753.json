The idea is that the multiple alignment process should be improved by taking into account the putative function of the sequences. In this perspective, MAGNOLIA is especially designed for sequences that are intended to be either proteincoding or structural RNAs. It extracts information from the similarities and differences in the data, and searches for a specific evolutionary pattern between sequences before aligning them. The alignment step then incorporates this information to achieve higher accuracy. The website is available at http://bioinfo. lifl.fr/magnolia."

            "text": "More and more newly sequenced genomes are becoming available every week. Tiling arrays are also gaining popularity for detecting novel transcripts in sequenced genomes. In this context, sequence annotation is an essential step in understanding the genome and the transcriptome of a species. Comparative genomics has proven to be a promising approach to address this problem. Large-scale comparisons of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes reveal thousands of conserved regions obtained by homology or synteny. These regions might be proteincoding sequences (1) or non-coding RNA genes (2,3,4). Annotation by comparative analysis typically involves two steps: first aligning the sequences, then analysing the multiple alignment to detect an evolutionary pattern that is representative of the selection pressure. This idea is exploited in Exoniphy (5) for exon detection, in RNAz (6) or Evofold (7) for structural RNA prediction or in Qrna (8), that implements both a coding and an noncoding model for RNAs. In this computational protocol, high-quality sequence alignment is an essential prerequisite step. This task, however, is difficult because sequence similarity is often reduced at the nucleic level.",

            "text": "Regarding protein coding genes, nucleic acid sequences exhibit a much larger sequence heterogeneity compared to their encoded amino acid sequences due to the redundancy of the genetic code. It is well known that the combination of nucleic acid and amino acid sequence information leads to improved alignments (9,10). The same situation holds for non-coding RNA genes. The spatial structure evolves slower than its primary structure. So puresequence-based multiple alignment tools perform poorly on low-homology datasets of structural RNAs (11). In this article, we present the MAGNOLIA website, whose objective is to provide an advanced tool for aligning nucleic acid sequences. The idea is to get rid of the dichotomy between aligning and predicting the function. If we assume that sequences are either protein-coding or structural RNAs, it is possible to incorporate some functional information into the alignment algorithm to improve the result. The multiple alignment can then be used as a starting point to refine the comparative analysis or to carry out further predictions, such as motif finding or phylogeny reconstruction.",

The method takes into account both the nucleic sequence and the putative common secondary structure predicted by caRNAc. It relies on the dynamic programming algorithm for pairwise comparison proposed in ref. (18). RNA sequences are encoded as arc-annotated sequences, and a multiple alignment for a set of arc-annotated sequences is a nested common supersequence. The edit scheme incorporates evolutionary operations concerning free bases (base substitution, base deletion) and base pairs (arc-mismatch, arc-removing, arc-breaking, arc-altering), originally defined in ref. (19). It is easy to show that this problem is NP-hard. We take a heuristic approach and use a progressive method. The method starts with constructing all pairwise alignments to determine the degree of similarity for each pair of sequences. Then it combines sequences into a multiple alignment by an ascending hierarchical clustering. Pairwise alignment of supersequences rely on the same algorithm as pairwise alignments for arc-annotated sequences. This is made possible because supersequences can be viewed as a nested arc-annotated sequences on an extended alphabet. The score of one node is its SP (sum-of-pairs) score. Lastly, the space search of the dynamic programming alignment is pruned using constraints coming from the caRNAc output. This provides a significant speed up.",

Concerning the secondary structure, base pairings are indicated in bracket-dot format: Each base-pair is represented by a pair of matching brackets and unpaired bases are represented by dots. The lack of pseudoknots in the secondary structure ensures that this notation defines a unique folding. Moreover, stems in the alignment are highlighted in colors. Figure 3 shows an example of output obtained with a family of non-coding RNAs. For each sequence, the individual putative secondary structure is also provided in five formats: CT, JPEG, PS, bracket-dot format and as a list of constrained base pairings. JPEG and PS files are automatically produced from the CT file using the NAview layout program (22). Some data sets are not identified as coding RNAs nor as non-coding RNAs. The first possibility is that the sequences might have an alternative function, such as untranslated regions in messenger RNAs, promoter elements, etc. The second possibility is that the sequences are highly conserved. In this context, the comparative analysis approach used by MAGNOLIA is not suitable. The evolutionary signal is too weak and the sequences do not exhibit any significant mutational bias towards any model. This is an intrinsic limitation of the method. But this limitation is harmless for practical purposes, because standard multiple sequence alignment tools usually yield good results on high-identity data sets.

MAGNOLIA failed to identify a structural evolutionary pattern for 20% of them and falsely assigned a protein coding function for 7% of them. Following ref. 11, we use the structure conservation index (SCI) to assess the  accuracy of alignments. This score provides a measure of the conserved secondary structure information contained within the alignment. Results for MAGNOLIA are reported in Figure 5, together with results for other alignment tools used in the benchmark. We also evaluated the accuracy of the secondary structure found by MAGNOLIA and compared it to two recent structural alignment programs: Murlet (16) and Mlocarna (17). For each software and for each identity class, we computed the percentage of correct base pairings amongst the set of predicted base pairings. Results are shown in Table 1. It appears that MAGNOLIA has similar performances as Murlet and outperforms Mlocarna. Furthermore, the total runtime is more than 12 times faster for MAGNOLIA than for the two other methods (< 20 min for the whole data set, compared to more than 4 hours).    Figure 5. MAGNOLIA alignments on BRaliBase II. The x-axis represents the average identity percentage and the y-axis represents the SCI value. The above curve is calculated from reference alignments. MAGNOLIA appears to be the closest curve to the reference curve for identity percentage ranging from 40% to 80%. For higher identity percentages, all methods show similar performances.",
