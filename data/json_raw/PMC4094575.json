            "text": "Prostacyclin analogues are standard therapeutic options for vasoconstrictive diseases, including pulmonary hypertension and Raynaud's phenomenon. Although effective, these treatment strategies are expensive and have several side effects. To improve drug efficiency, we tested liposomal nanoparticles as carrier systems. In this study, we synthesized liposomal nanoparticles tailored for the prostacyclin analogue iloprost and evaluated their pharmacologic efficacy on mouse intrapulmonary arteries, using a wire myograph. The use of cationic lipids, stearylamine, or 1,2-di-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) in liposomes promoted iloprost encapsulation to at least 50%. The addition of cholesterol modestly reduced iloprost encapsulation. The liposomal nanoparticle formulations were tested for toxicity and pharmacologic efficacy in vivo and ex vivo, respectively. The liposomes did not affect the viability of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Compared with an equivalent concentration of free iloprost, four out of the six polymer-coated liposomal formulations exhibited significantly enhanced vasodilation of mouse pulmonary arteries. Iloprost that was encapsulated in liposomes containing the polymer polyethylene glycol exhibited concentration-dependent relaxation of arteries. Strikingly, half the concentration of iloprost in liposomes elicited similar pharmacologic efficacy as nonencapsulated iloprost. Cationic liposomes can encapsulate iloprost with high efficacy and can serve as potential iloprost carriers to improve its therapeutic efficacy.",

For inhalation purpose, neutral lipids, like phosphatidylcholines, and anionic lipids, like phosphatidylglycerols, were used for encapsulation of beclomethasone, 19,20 fasudil, 21 and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), 22 respectively. None of these formulations has yet attained clinical status; however, many more liposomal formulations are in the pipeline. 13 Previously, Kleemann et al described liposomal encapsulation of the vasodilator iloprost, using conventional liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, and also sterically stabilized liposomes, using PEG. 23 However, their study was limited by low encapsulation efficiencies. Here, we investigated the feasibility of tailoring liposomal formulations to improve the encapsulation efficiency of iloprost and enhance its pharmacologic efficacy. Since iloprost chemically possesses negative charge at pH 7.4, we examined the possibility of using cationic lipids to promote encapsulation. We developed and characterized several novel liposomal formulations that were optimized for the delivery of iloprost, and we tested their effects on cell viability and their pharmacologic efficacy on mouse intrapulmonary arteries, using a wire myograph.",

Cumulative concentrations of the thromboxane analogue, U-46619 (0.01-3 \u00b5M), produced a concentration-dependent contraction ( Figure 4A). The EC 50 of U-46619 was determined to be 0.03 \u00b5M. At this concentration, a stable constriction was maintained for up to 2 hours ( Figure S3A). For all subsequent experiments, this EC 50 dose of U-46619 was used to precontract the arteries. Following precontraction, addition of iloprost produced a rapid and sustained vasodilation ( Figure S3B). The viability and smooth muscle induced relaxation was confirmed by the addition of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside ( Figure S3B). Upon noncumulative applications, iloprost exhibited a nonlinear concentration-dependent relaxation ( Figure 4B). Maximal relaxation was observed with 10 \u00b5M of iloprost, with no further increase at higher concentrations. Therefore, we chose half of this concentration (5 \u00b5M) for all further experiments. Together, these results confirm the validity of the test system and that iloprost acted as a potent vasodilator on mouse pulmonary arteries.",

Differences in the liposome surface charge (\u03b6-potential) were dependent on the presence of PVP (LI-2, -5, and -6) or PEG (LI-1, -3, and -4), with PVP-liposomes possessing higher \u03b6-potential (Table 1). Liposomes containing SA or DOTAP exhibited similar \u03b6-potential. The higher \u03b6-potential in the PVP-liposomes presumably originates from the nitrogen-bearing pyrrolidone ring in PVP.

Furthermore, the encapsulation efficiency for iloprost was greatly affected by the choice of phospholipid. Saturated phospholipids, like DPPC, form densely packed bilayer structures, which mean very limited void volumes between the acyl chains. In contrast, unsaturated phospholipids, such as POPC, possess higher void volumes and could therefore intercalate more amphiphilic drug within the bilayer, and therefore, could be beneficial for iloprost encapsulation. Cholesterol has been reported to induce a conformational change in the lipid bilayer, imparting cohesive strength to the bilayer and reducing leakiness from liposomes. 29 Furthermore, cholesterol can increase liposome membrane rigidity and may improve stability in vitro and in vivo. 30 The incorporation of cholesterol (~15 mole %) in two of our SA-containing formulations resulted in reduced iloprost encapsulation. This result leads us to speculate that a part of iloprost is preferentially intercalated within the liposome bilayer and to propose that the cholesterol in LI-3 and LI-5 may have acted as a bilayer stiffener, which reduced iloprost capture.",

This is in line with previous study, which reported that instillation of cationic liposomes loaded with low molecular weight heparin did not significantly elevate lung injury markers. 27 Due to the difficulty in obtaining human material, we analyzed the pharmacologic efficacy of the liposomal formulations on mouse pulmonary arteries. The thromboxane analogue U-46619 was chosen as the preconstrictor since elevated levels of thromboxane have been reported in PH patients. 35 At 10 and 30 \u00b5M concentration, iloprost produced similar relaxation kinetics, which indicates ~10 \u00b5M as the maximal effective concentration; therefore, experiments directly comparing free and encapsulated iloprost were performed at 5 \u00b5M. The iloprost-induced relaxation of preconstricted arteries (maximum 40%) can be attributable to several factors: in mice and humans, iloprost preferentially binds the IP receptor, thereby evoking vasodilation, but also possesses high affinity for the vasoconstrictive EP1 and EP3 receptors. [36][37][38] In murine pulmonary arteries, we observed highest expression of the EP1 receptor, followed by IP then EP3 (Figure 4). It is possible that human pulmonary arteries may have different expression levels of these receptors, which may alter the response to iloprost. Our expression data, together with the receptor binding affinity of iloprost, indicates that the strong vasodilative response induced by IP is attenuated by activation of the EP1 and/or EP3 receptors.",

Studies from Woo et al demonstrated that liposomal encapsulation of deguelin enhanced the antitumor efficacy by reducing the required dose from 4 mg/kg to 0.4 mg/kg and thus, may prevent potential side effects. 39 The exact mechanism whereby liposomal iloprost possesses higher activity is currently unclear; however, this may arise from a combination of factors, like shielding the drug from degradation, docking of liposomes to the pulmonary artery, or presentation of iloprost in an orientation that facilitates IP receptor binding. Based on our findings, we propose that liposomal iloprost formulations can enhance the pharmacologic efficacy of iloprost and therefore, may reduce the therapeutic dose.",

Iloprost-loaded cationic liposomes show enhanced vasodilation in comparison with free iloprost. This improved pharmacologic efficacy could be interesting with respect to minimizing the associated manufacturing costs and may be advantageous in terms of systemic side effects.
