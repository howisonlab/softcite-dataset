The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is the preferred vaccine for children, but the mechanisms behind protective immune responses are unclear, and the duration of immunity remains to be elucidated. This study reports on the longevity of B-cell and T-cell responses elicited by the LAIV. Methods. Thirty-eight children (3-17 years old) were administered seasonal LAIV. Blood samples were collected before vaccination with sequential sampling up to 1 year after vaccination. Humoral responses were evaluated by a hemagglutination inhibition assay, and memory B-cell responses were evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot). T-cell responses were evaluated by interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) ELISpot analysis, and intracellular cytokine staining of CD4 + T cells for detection of IFN-\u03b3, interleukin 2, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 was performed using flow cytometry. Results. LAIV induced significant increases in B-cell and T-cell responses, which were sustained at least 1 year after vaccination. Strain variations were observed, in which the B strain elicited stronger responses. IFN-\u03b3-expressing T cell counts increased significantly, and remained higher than prevaccination levels 1 year later. Expression of T-helper type 1 intracellular cytokines (interleukin 2, IFN-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1) increased after 1 dose and were boosted after the second dose. Hemagglutination inhibition titers were sustained for 1 year. Vaccine-induced memory B cell counts were significantly increased, and the response persisted for one year. Conclusions. LAIV elicited B-cell and T-cell responses that persisted for at least 1 year in children. This is a novel finding that will aid future vaccine policy.",

            "text": "that 20% of children are infected with influenza virus each year, and they are the main source of spread of the virus and have a high burden of the disease [4]. Vaccination is the cornerstone of prophylaxis and is recommended for high-risk patients. The trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) is safe and provides protection but may not be the optimal vaccine for young children, owing to their lack of previous infection. Since 2003, the cold-adapted live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), administered as a nasal spray, has been approved in the United States for individuals aged 2-49 years. The vaccine was licensed in Europe in 2012 (for individuals aged 2-17 years) and was implemented in the British childhood vaccination campaign, beginning in 2013 [5]. In June 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices preferentially recommended LAIV in healthy children 2-8 years old when it is immediately available [6]. Despite many years on the market, there are no established correlates of protection for LAIV. Efficacy studies and observational data suggest that the LAIV provides higher levels of protection than TIV in children [7][8][9][10][11]. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer is widely used as a surrogate correlate of protection after TIV receipt; however, the cutoff titer of 1:40 is based on adult trials. There is debate on both the protective HI level in children and the fact that an HI titer underestimates the protection obtained by LAIV [12][13][14]. Cellular immunity may be a better measure of protective immunity after LAIV in children [15]. CD4 + T cells have the ability to act as effector cells and to direct and generate specific memory CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell subsets with diverse functions [16][17][18]. Animal and human studies have demonstrated protective cellular immunity after LAIV [10,[19][20][21]. Therefore, the duration and quality of the immune response in humans after LAIV needs to be studied.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the longevity of the humoral and cellular immune responses elicited by LAIV in young children, with a focus on the effect of priming. To our knowledge, our study is unique in reporting the long-term immune responses to LAIV in children, including those with asthma.

In general, the highest immune response was against the B strain, followed by the H3N2 strain, with the lowest response against the H1N1 strain. The total levels of serum IgG, IgA, and IgM were stable throughout the study period [32]. The serological response to LAIV was evaluated by an HI assay, with differences observed in the response to the H1N1 and H3N2 strains. Before vaccination, the majority of the children had protective antibody titers (HI titer, \u226540) against the H1N1 strain, which did not increase after vaccination but remained elevated 1 year after vaccination. This may be because H1N1 was a dominant circulating influenza A strain in 2009 and 2010. Hence, most of the children were primed, either by natural infection or pandemic vaccination [33]. As LAIV must replicate to elicit an immune response, the presence of preexisting antibodies or cross-reactive T cells in primed children could inhibit virus infection and replication, resulting in lower HI responses. In contrast, the H3N2 strain circulated to a much lesser degree in Norway; hence, most children were unprimed against this strain [33]. The B strain had limited circulation in the prior seasons, except during 2010-2011; it is therefore possible that most children were naive to this strain, consistent with the observation that LAIVs elicit stronger immune responses in unprimed children [34]. Apart from priming, differences in infectivity among the vaccine strains could also impact the subsequent immune response. We saw no difference in durability of the immune response after 1 or 2 doses of vaccine ( Supplementary Figures 3  and 4).",

In this study, levels of influenza virus-specific memory B cells increased after vaccination and were maintained for 1 year. Memory B cells can rapidly differentiate into antibody-secreting plasmablasts upon antigen reencounter. They may possess broad cross-reactivity and the ability to go through secondary affinity maturation to altered antigenic epitopes [35,36]. The IgG + and IgA + memory B-cell responses in our study were strain dependent. When we divided the children according to a protective HI titer of 40, we observed that, in influenza virus-primed children, the levels of memory B cells were not boosted upon vaccination (data not shown). The lack of a boosting response after vaccination in B cells in primed individuals has previously been described in adults [37,38]. In contrast to the IgG + and IgA + memory B-cell responses, the IgM + memory B-cell response increased significantly against all 3 influenza virus strains. Recent research suggests that isotype-switched, affinity-matured memory B cells dominate the antibody-secreting cell response on antigen recall, while the majority of IgM + memory B cells contain less somatic hypermutations and dominate the formation of new germinal centers [38,39]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that IgM + memory B cells live longer than their isotype-switched counterparts [39]. Thus, the influenza virus-specific IgM + memory B cells may contain a population with the potential to respond to novel antigenic variants (eg, drifted influenza viruses). The observed strain variations may indicate a biological threshold for memory B-cell responses in children with preexisting memory B cells due to previous influenza virus exposure.",

Human studies have shown naturally acquired CD4 + and CD8 + T cells to be important in limiting disease and may provide heterosubtypic immunity, which may influence the influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) response [40,41]. T cells respond to conserved epitopes, which is why the response to influenza A viruses is interlinked. Importantly, cross-reactive T cells elicited by LAIV have the potential to protect against drifted strains and shifted pandemic strains. This has been demonstrated in animal models [42,43].

Interestingly, 5 subjects in our study who, on the basis of HI assays, did not seroconvert to H1N1 had a significant increase in their IFN-\u03b3 response after 2 vaccine doses, which may provide clinical protection. In fact, HI titers are known to underestimate the protective effect achieved by the LAIV in children, and clinical efficacy studies on LAIV have shown high levels of protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza despite low HI titers [7,44,45].

            "text": "Recent studies suggest that CD4 + T cells that simultaneously secrete IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, or TNF-\u03b1 (multifunctional T cells) are functionally superior than single cytokine producers at inducing anti-influenza virus immunity [46]. In this study, we have shown that LAIV induces a significant increase in both single-cytokine and multifunctional Th1 responses in children. The magnitude of the Th1 cytokine responses induced after LAIV receipt was lower than observed in adult subjects after intramuscular vaccination with candidate pandemic vaccines [25,47]. Differences in the route of administration (intramuscular or intranasal) and formulation with the adjuvant in immunologically naive subjects could partly explain the superiority of the parenteral vaccine at inducing a Th1 response in peripheral blood. However, in children, LAIV has been shown to be a better inducer of T-cell responses than TIV [10,48,49]. This may explain, at least in part, the higher efficacy of LAIV, compared with TIV, in children during head-to-head clinical trials [29]. Nonetheless, vaccine-induced long-lived memory CD4 + T cells may provide broader protection and should be a goal of novel vaccines [18]. With respect to cytotoxic T cells, we did not detect an increase in antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell responses at any time point after LAIV receipt. This is most likely due to the use of split virus proteins for in vitro PBMC stimulation, resulting in inefficient antigen cross-presentation to stimulate a CD8 + T-cell response.",
