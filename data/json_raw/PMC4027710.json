To affirm the presence of OH and find correlation between OH and other dysautonomic symptoms in PD, this study has done in newly-diagnosed PD patients. Methods: Forty-five non-demented patients with no prior history of treatment for PD were recruited (17 men, 63.8 \u00b1 10.1 years of age). All the patients were evaluated for OH before starting medications. Autonomic symptoms were evaluated with structured questionnaires. Clinical characteristics of PD were evaluated (median Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.0 (1-3), 1.3 \u00b1 1.1 years of disease duration), and comorbid medical conditions that could affect blood pressure were also recorded. Results: OH was prevalent, and eighteen patients (40%) showed orthostatic hypotension, and twenty-seven (60%) did not (normotensive group). There was no significant difference in demographic and clinical characteristics between groups. The presence or severity of symptoms of autonomic dysfunction in the OH group also not differed from those of the normotensive group. Conclusions: OH was prevalent even in the early stage of PD, and was not related to presence or severity of any other symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. Our findings suggest that clinicians should pay attention to OH from the early stage of disease.",

            "text": "Clinically, Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. However, patients with PD may also experience many complaints beyond motor symptoms, which are referred to as non-motor symptoms. 1 The non-motor symptoms of PD are very diverse, including neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep disturbances, sensory symptoms, and dysautonomic symptoms. 2 It has become increasingly apparent that non-motor symptoms have a quite considerable impact on the quality of life of PD patients. 1 Impaired cardiovascular response to postural changes, particularly orthostatic hypotension (OH) is considered an important clinical and even diagnostic feature for the multiple system atrophy or pure autonomic failure. 3,4 In PD, OH was thought to develop later in the disease course or only in more severe cases often in elderly patients. [5][6][7] Moreover, OH has been thought to be a side effect of anti-parkinsonian medications, like levodopa and dopamine agonists. [8][9][10][11][12] However, it is accepted that OH is also a common finding even in the early stages of PD. 13,14 The authors evaluated OH among newly-diagnosed PD patients and the relationship between OH and other symptoms of autonomic dysfunctions in patients.",

In 5 relatively large studies involving more than 80 patients each, the frequency of OH ranged from 30% to 58%. 6 Bonuccelli et al. 21 showed the high prevalence of OH in de novo PD patients. In our study, prevalence of OH in the drug-na\u00efve PD patients was moderate (18/45 patients, 40%), and similarly shown in the patients without comorbid disease (9/23 patient, 39.1%). Patients with OH were young and showed a short duration of disease, but those differences did not reach statistical significance, and the severity of parkinsonian symptoms was similar to those of pa-tients without OH. The presence or severity of dysautonomic symptoms was not different between patients with or without OH, even in the cardiovascular domain. Therefore, OH did not respect the severity or distribution of other autonomic symptoms. Actually, the complaint of orthostasis was made by only six patients (13.3%), four of those patients showed OH. Most patients with OH did not complain of orthostasis, and Steven et al. showed that the majority of patients with profound orthostatic hypotension either did not show the typical symptoms (33%), or showed only atypical symptoms (24%). 22 The unawareness of orthostatic hypotension stresses the importance of blood pressure monitoring irrelevant to complaints of patients. Although we could not find statistical significance, patients with urinary incontinence were much higher in OH group (27.8% vs. 7.4%). This finding suggests that those patients can be diagnosed as multiple system atrophy (MSA). We followed all the patients more than six months and confirmed the good response to dopaminergic treatment. Because some patients with MSA show good response to treatment in early period, we could not exclude the possibility of MSA. Further studies with longer period of observation and about the change of dysautonomic symptoms along the disease course are warranted.",
