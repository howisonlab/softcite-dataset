Chronic low-level bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response have been suggested as a pathogenic link between periodontal disease and systemic disease. The present study was aimed to assess the levels of systemic inflammatory markers in patients with AgP. Methods: A sample of 50 systemically healthy patients comprised two groups, based on full mouth periodontal examination: Group I healthy individuals, includes 25 periodontally healthy subjects with fully functioning dentition. Group II includes 25 patients diagnosed clinically as AgP. Laboratory blood investigation included white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and platelet count. Serum protein parameters included total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), and globulin (GLB). Periodontal clinical parameters including plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment level were recorded. Results: Data analysis shows an increase in WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet count and a decrease in TP, ALB, and GLB in AgP patients when compared to healthy individuals. Conclusion: Results of the present study shows an increase in blood parameters and decrease in serum protein parameters in AgP. Hence, AgP could be considered as one of the risk factors associated with the cardiovascular diseases as assessed by changes in the level of systemic inflammatory markers observed.",

            "text": "Aggressive periodontitis (AgP) encompasses the distinct types of periodontitis that affect people who, in most cases, otherwise appears healthy. In some patients, periodontal tissue loss may commence before puberty, whereas in most patients the age of onset is during or somewhat after the circumpubertal period. Besides infection with specific microorganisms such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis a host predisposition seems to play a key role in the pathogenesis of AgP, as evidenced by the familial aggregation of the disease. 1 In contrast to chronic periodontitis, AgP is characterized by the age of onset of disease, rapid rate of disease progression, the nature and composition of the subgingival micro flora and alteration in host immune response. 2 Patients with systemic diseases like hematological disorders will have severe bone loss similar to AgP, and it should be differentiated by assessing the systemic status, hematological parameters of the patient. Studies have shown that intra-osseous sarcoidosis, 3 eosinophilic granulomas, 4 and alveolar bone actinomycosis shows the clinical features like mimicking AgP, and it should be differentiated by biopsy. 5 Systemic factors modify the periodontitis principally by acting on the normal immune and inflammatory defense cells. It has been seen that with the reduction in number or function of polymorphonuclear, there is increased rate and severity of the periodontal destruction. The blood cells have a vital role in supplying oxygen, maintaining hemostasis, and providing protection to the periodontal tissues. Systemic hematological disorders can thus have profound effects on the periodontium; if any of these functions is altered, they can have a detrimental effect on the integrity of the periodontium. 6 For thousands of years, blood has been regarded as an ultimate body fluid that could indicate the disease processes. In the past decade, there has been a renewed interest in the ways in which periodontitis may affect the changes in cellular and molecular components of the peripheral blood. 7 individuals with fully functioning dentition. Group II includes 25 patients diagnosed clinically AgP. All patients received the verbal explanation of the nature of the study and informed written consent was obtained. The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Rajah Muthiah Dental College and Hospital.",

Several studies have shown the systemic effect of periodontal diseases. 8 Traditionally, an elevation in the number of peripheral leukocytes and a variation in the levels of serum proteins identified as acute-phase proteins are the characteristic of infectious conditions.
