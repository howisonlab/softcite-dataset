Methods: A total of 360 CHB inpatients were recruited from Affiliated Dongnan Hospital of Xiamen University and divided into hepatic steatosis group and non-hepatic steatosis group. The body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) and hepatic histological changes were detected and compared between the two groups. The association of these factors with hepatic steatosis was evaluated in CHB patients. Results: BMI, FPG, TG, TC, GGT, AST and HBV DNA showed statistically significant differences between two groups (P<0.01). The patients with hepatic steatosis had markedly higher BMI, FBG, TG and TC than those without steatosis did. No significant differences were found in ALT and HBeAg between two groups (P>0.05). In male patients, there was marked difference in the WHR between two groups (P < 0.01), which was not found in female patients (P > 0.05). The severity of hepatic steatosis increased in patients with hepatic steatosis, compared to those without steatosis (P < 0. 01), but the severities of inflammation and fibrosis in the non-hepatic steatosis group were dramatically higher than those in the hepatic steatosis group (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: BMI, WHR, FBG, TG and TC appeared to be influencing factors of CHB combined with hepatic steatosis. Hepatic steatosis in CHB patients was closely related to changes in anthropometric indices and metabolic factors but not HBV. It is necessary to improve these factors to effectively prevent hepatic steatosis in CHB patients.",

Correspondingly, the prevalence of hepatic steatosis is on the rise, being the second commonest liver disease in developed countries. Hepatic steatosis is associated with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, car-dio-cerebrovascular diseases and some malignant tumors [1]. At the moment, hepatic steatosis ranks among the second commonest liver disease around the world secondary only to viral hepatitis, which imposes a large burden on human health. It is well known that hepatic steatosis plays an important role in hepatic inflammatory necrosis and fibrosis development in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC),",

The prevalence of HBsAg positive patients in China also decreases, although it is still as high as 7.18% [7]. In clinical practice, hepatic steatosis is frequently found in CHB patients [6] with a reported incidence of 18%-27% [15,16]. With the improvement of living standard and change in lifestyle in recent years, the distributions of BMI, WHR and WC also significantly alter. The BMI, WHR and WC are continuously increasing in both developed and developing countries. The numbers of overweight and obese subjects are 14.6 billion and 500 million, respectively, around the world [17]. The prevalence of hepatic steatosis in CHB patients tends to increase over years, and patients with these conditions may develop cirrhosis or even hepatocarcinoma [2]. Hepatic steatosis can be induced by excessive alcohol intake, drug abuse, nutrition imbalance and metabolic diseases and is generally associated with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and some malignant tumors, exerting important impacts on human health [18]. CHB patients usually have different lifestyles and diet habits from healthy people because of lack of exercise and improvement in appetite during recovery period. Therefore, to determine factors influencing the development of hepatic steatosis in CHB patients may help us in the prevention and treatment of these conditions. It is also crucial for screening and confirming these influencing factors of these diseases so that we can timely prevent and early diagnose steatosis in CHB patients.",

            "text": "This was a case-control study on CHB patients with and without hepatic steatosis which was confirmed by clinical and pathological features. There were no significant differences in gender and age between two groups. Our results showed that the BMI of steatosis patients was significantly higher than that of non-steatosis patients. The mean WHR of male patients differed between two group, which was not observed in female patients, probably because of different distribution patterns of body fat between males and females [19]. It is well known that WHR is one of most important anthropometric indices that can predict the occurrence of simple fatty liver [20]. The present study showed that CHB patients with steatosis had higher BMI and WHR than those without steatosis did. CHB patients are more likely to develop hepatic steatosis as their BMI and WHR increase, suggesting that increased BMI and WHR may promote hepatic fat deposition in CHB patients. Thus, to control the increases in BMI and WHR is an effective way to prevent hepatic steatosis in CHB patients. Moreover, steatosis patients had higher levels of FBG, TG and TC than non-steatosis patients, indicating that inflammation in the liver is related to disordered metabolism of blood glucose and lipid (especially hypertriglyceridemia). It is important to closely monitor the BMI, WHR, blood glucose and lipid and to treat hypertriglyceridemia in CHB patients which may prevent the occurrence of hepatic steatosis. In addition, the levels of ALT, AST and GGT were significantly higher in steatosis patients than in non-steatosis patients. It is possible that CHB patients with hepatic steatosis develop metabolic disorders, according to the increased BMI and WHR. The metabolic disorders may interact with CHB, further causing damage to liver function [22]. Our results indicated that, in order to prevent hepatic steatosis in CHB patients, it is beneficial to periodically monitor BMI and WHR, to properly control the blood glucose and lipid, as well as to educate these patients about healthy lifestyle, scientific dieting and physical exercise.",

            "text": "A large body of evidence has demonstrated that HCV combined with hepatic steatosis is associated with type 3 HCV gene, which accounts for 80% of all HCV infections [4]. The mechanism of type 3 HCV infection lies in that the core protein of HCV inhibits the activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and interferes with the assembly and secretion of very low density lipoprotein [21]. In the present study, the positive rates of HBeAg and HBV DNA were compared between patients with and without steatosis, and results showed that there was no significant difference in the positive rate of HBeAg between two groups, while the positive rate of HBV DNA was significantly different. These results suggest that liver injury in CHB patients without hepatic steatosis is related to HBV. The positive rate of HBV DNA in patients with steatosis was lower than that in patients without steatosis, which means that HBV is not directly related to the hepatic steatosis in CHB patients. It was reported that the HBV DNA load was significantly lower in CHB patients with hepatic steatosis than in those without hepatic steatosis and that hepatic steatosis in CHB patients was not related to HBV infection [23]. Previous clinical studies revealed that both CHB patients with hepatic steatosis and hepatic steatosis patients had hyperlipidemia and obesity, suggesting that the occurrence and development of hepatic steatosis in CHB patients are closely associated with metabolic factors [24], which is consistent with our results.",

The pathological features are the golden standard for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis in CHB patients, but it is impossible for wide application in clinical practice. In addition, the noninvasive method of fibroscan for diagnosis of hepatic steatosis is currently in the exploratory stage [25,26]. Our findings showed that anthropometric indices and metabolic factors were related to hepatic steatosis in CHB patients, and BMI, WHR, FBG, TG and TC, but not HBV, were influencing factors of steatosis. Therefore, to monitor anthropometric indices (especially BMI and WHR) and to measure biochemical parameters (such as FBG, TG and TC) are helpful for early diagnosis of hepatic steatosis, evaluation of antiviral treatment and improvement of prognosis in CHB patients. There are some limitations in this study, such as lack of evaluation of antiviral treatment. It remains controversial whether hepatic steatosis influences the efficacy of antiviral therapy. Clinical investigations showed that treatment with polyethylene glycol interferon in CHB patients with hepatic steatosis for 48 weeks had no influence on the virological response but altered the biochemical response [27]. However, another study showed that hepatic steatosis was significantly associated with Entecavir treatment failure [28]. Thus, the antiviral treatment in CHB patient with hepatic steatosis needs to be further assessed to determine whether the hepatic steatosis affects the efficacy of antiviral treatment.",
