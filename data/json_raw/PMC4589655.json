We describe the early performance of a novel self-contained miniaturized pacemaker. Methods and results Patients having Class I or II indication for VVI pacing underwent implantation of a Micra transcatheter pacing system, from the femoral vein and fixated in the right ventricle using four protractible nitinol tines. Prespecified objectives were .85% freedom from unanticipated serious adverse device events (safety) and ,2 V 3-month mean pacing capture threshold at 0.24 ms pulse width (efficacy). Patients were implanted (n \u00bc 140) from 23 centres in 11 countries (61% male, age 77.0 + 10.2 years) for atrioventricular block (66%) or sinus node dysfunction (29%) indications. During mean follow-up of 1.9 + 1.8 months, the safety endpoint was met with no unanticipated serious adverse device events. Thirty adverse events related to the system or procedure occurred, mostly due to transient dysrhythmias or femoral access complications. One pericardial effusion without tamponade occurred after 18 device deployments. In 60 patients followed to 3 months, mean pacing threshold was 0.51 + 0.22 V, and no threshold was \u22652 V, meeting the efficacy endpoint (P , 0.001). Average R-wave was 16.1 + 5.2 mV and impedance was 650.7 + 130 ohms. Conclusion Early assessment shows the transcatheter pacemaker can safely and effectively be applied. Long-term safety and benefit of the pacemaker will further be evaluated in the trial. Clinical Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02004873.",

            "text": "Permanent cardiac pacing, the only effective treatment for symptomatic bradycardia, reduces symptoms and recurrence of syncope, and improves survival in high-risk populations. 1 -3 Since their introduction in the 1960s, pacemakers have shrunk in size and grown in sophistication, yet their basic function remains to be sustaining a normal heart rate. Conventional pacing systems consist of a pacemaker containing the electronics and battery typically implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the chest. One or more leads threaded from the device pocket through veins into the heart conduct the pacing therapy to the desired pacing site. When veins cannot be used, a surgical procedure includes implanting epicardial leads that link the heart to the device. Despite the reduction in complications due to technological advances, serious adverse events can still be encountered. These are reported to be 20% at 5 years, with highest contributions related to the pacing lead ( 11%) and pocket ( 8%), 4 including pneumo/ haemothorax after subclavian vein puncture, pocket haematoma, erosion or infection, vein stenosis or occlusion, endocarditis, tricuspid valve trauma, connection troubles, lead fractures, and other malfunctions. 5 -8 Micra TM transcatheter pacing system (TPS, Model MC1VR01, Medtronic plc, Mounds View, MN, USA) is a miniaturized single-chamber pacemaker system that is delivered via catheter through the femoral vein and implanted directly inside the right ventricle (RV) of the heart. This new technology is feasible due to advances in miniaturization (high-density battery), low-power electronics, catheter delivery systems, novel materials (nitinol), and electrodes being directly placed on the pacemaker capsule. This eliminates the need for a device pocket and insertion of a pacing lead, thereby eliminating an important source of complications associated with traditional pacing systems while providing similar benefits.",

The device is 25.9 mm in length, with an outer diameter of 6.7 mm. A nominal pulse width duration of 0.24 ms was chosen since it is near the chronaxie of the strength duration curve. 10 Utilizing a pulse width near the chronaxie should minimize pacing energy and improve battery longevity.

The introducer is advanced using a guide-wire and dilator into the right atrium. The guide-wire and dilator are then removed, and the steerable delivery system catheter with TPS preloaded and tethered is then advanced into the RV. Transcatheter pacing system is deployed by retraction of the device-containing cup at the distal end of the delivery catheter positioned against the RV endocardium with fixation into the myocardium by the associated protraction of the nitinol tines ( Figure 3). The delivery catheter is then withdrawn several centimetres and the fixation confirmed by a 'pull and hold' test. The tether is pulled until counter movement of the heartbeats can be felt and the tine deflection can be observed fluoroscopically, with the tethering material still connected to the TPS. Although bench testing has shown a single tine engaged in tissue holds the device securely within the myocardium with a high margin of safety, it is recommended that two tines are engaged for further security of fixation. Therefore, investigators are requested to check fluoroscopically that at least two tines are engaged within the myocardium before releasing the device; otherwise, the device should be retracted and repositioned to another position within the RV. Once the device is placed in the RV and adequate device fixation verified, electrical measurements (pacing thresholds, pacing impedance, R-wave amplitude) are checked. Inadequate fixation (e.g. device tines engage into the trabeculae rather than RV myocardial wall) will be apparent via unacceptable electrical measurements and possibly failed pull and hold test. In case of persistence of high thresholds after two to three deployments, investigators were advised to remove the transcatheter delivery system in order to check for thrombus covering the tip electrode, and, if found, to carefully remove the thrombus. No specific implant location is recommended as the device can be placed at various anatomical RV positions. However, it is suggested to avoid placement at the free wall to minimize risk of effusion.",

Thus, the rate of USADEs was selected to characterize unforeseen risk associated with TPS.

The same patient experienced an acute myocardial infarction 3 days post-implant and angiography revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease. Transient complete AV block occurred in four patients and resolved within seconds to a few hours. Three cases of transient AV block required pacing via a temporary wire. The fourth resolved with immediate programming to active pacing after device deployment. Each of the four patients experiencing transient AV block had a history of LBBB or prolonged AV conduction (two had second-degree AV block, one had LBBB with first-degree AV block, and one had LBBB). Groin bleeding ('incision site haemorrhage') was observed in three of the 140 patients, and a haematoma in two. None of these events were considered serious, and all cases resolved without invasive intervention. There were two cases of arterial pseudoaneurysms. One of the two events was considered serious and required thrombin injection with prolonged hospitalization. The other pseudoaneurysm was not considered serious and resolved without any invasive intervention. There was no apparent relationship to heparin use or closure method approach in the events which were observed at the groin puncture site.

A suture method was used for closure in each of these 11 cases except one where only manual pressure was applied).

Thirty adverse events related to the procedure or system were identified in the 140 implanted patients, none of which were due to device dislodgement or infections. There were no deaths related to the procedure or system and no re-operations were required. Telemetry contact remained feasible in all patients. Adverse events did not differ substantially across patient sub-groups. One case of pericardial effusion occurred in the context of 18 positionings due to undesirable electrical performance. In light of this observation, persistent repositioning should be avoided in order to limit the possible injury to the myocardium and surrounding vessels. In case of undesirable thresholds immediately after deployment, some waiting time should be considered before measuring electricals again. As is frequently observed in tined and helix-based pacemaker leads, 13 thresholds may improve within minutes, thus allowing release of the device.

However, in the meantime, mode selection may be influenced by the technological advantages of a miniaturized transcatheter pacemaker, advantages that include the absence of lead and pocket related risks and device implant cosmesis. Atrial and dual-chamber pacing modes have recently been preferred for bradyarrhythmia patients without permanent or persistent atrial tachyarrhythmia due to risks associated with AV dysynchrony, notably pacemaker syndrome. 19 Over one-third of the patients who received TPS in our trial were without history of permanent or persistent atrial tachyarrhythmia. Of these patients, the primary pacing indication was SND (45%) or AV block (39%).
