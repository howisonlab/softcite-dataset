We have identified SorY as an sRNA, which is induced under several stress conditions and confers increased resistance against 1 O 2. SorY by direct interaction affects the takP mRNA, encoding a TRAP-T transporter. We present a model in which SorY reduces the metabolite flux into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) by reducing malate import through TakP. It was previously shown that oxidative stress in bacteria leads to switch from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway and to reduced activity of the TCA cycle. As a consequence the production of the prooxidant NADH is reduced and production of the protective NADPH is enhanced. In R. sphaeroides enzymes for glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, Entner-Doudoroff pathway and gluconeogenesis are induced in response to 1 O 2 by the alternative sigma factor RpoHII. The same is true for the sRNA SorY. By limiting malate import SorY thus contributes to the balance of the metabolic fluxes under photooxidative stress conditions. This assigns a so far unknown function to an sRNA in oxidative stress response.",

            "text": "Microorganisms have to cope with oxidative stress in almost all environments and have therefore evolved sophisticated defense systems. A special type of oxidative stress is the so-called photooxidative stress, which occurs in the presence of light, oxygen and a photosensitizer. In photosynthetic organisms (bacterio-) chlorophylls act as photosensitizers, which transfer energy to ground state triplet oxygen generating highly reactive 1 O 2 . The response to photooxidative stress has been intensively investigated in the facultative photosynthetic alpa-proteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides (reviewed in 1,2 ). Rhodobacter uses oxygen for aerobic respiration but induces the formation of photosynthetic complexes when oxygen concentration decreases. The presence of blue light counteracts the formation of photosynthetic complexes at intermediate oxygen concentrations most likely in order to prevent the formation of 1 O 2 . 3-5 1 O 2 triggers a complex response at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. [6][7][8][9] A main regulator of this response is the alternative sigma factor RpoE, which directly activates a small subset of genes including the rpoHII gene. The RpoHII sigma factor subsequently induces a large subset of genes, many of them with known functions in the oxidative stress response. 6,10 Under non-stress conditions RpoE is inactivated by the anti-sigma factor ChrR, 11 which is proteolytically degraded upon 1 O 2 stress. 12,13 Many genes which are targeted by RpoHII are also targeted by RpoHI, which is independent of RpoE and has a main role in the heat shock response. 14,15 1 O 2 does not only induce transcription of protein coding RNAs in R. sphaeroides but also of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). 9,[16][17][18] sRNAs have been identified as components of many bacterial regulatory networks and have important roles in the fine-tuning of adaptation processes. Trans-acting sRNAs target mRNAs which are transcribed from other regions of their genome and affect their translation and/or stability. 19 The RNA chaperon Hfq is often required for the interaction of trans-acting sRNAs and their target mRNAs. [20][21][22] The sRNA RSs1543 of R. sphaeroides is induced in response to photooxidative stress. 9 Here we show that RSs1543 responds to a variety of stresses and influences photooxidative stress resistance of R. sphaeroides. Therefore RSs1543 was renamed SorY for 1 O 2 resistance RNA Y. We identified the takP mRNA, that encodes the extracytoplasmic receptor subunit of a TRAP-T transporter, as direct target of SorY and provide a model for the role of this sRNA in the photooxidative stress response. According to the model SorY regulates TakP synthesis negatively during photooxidative stress to decrease harmful malate influx at high rates into the cell to favor the pathway shunt from the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) to the pentose phosphate pathway and Entner-Doudoroff pathway.",

Rhodobacter genes under control of RpoHI/RpoHII promoters often respond to multiple stresses. 15,23 We therefore tested the expression of SorY under several conditions in the wild type strain. Indeed SorY is also induced by the organic hydroperoxide tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH), hydrogen peroxide, the super oxide generating paraquat, by heat, by diamide, by NaCl, by CdCl 2 and by SDS/ EDTA (Fig. 1A, B). There was no effect of ethanol or polymyxin-B, which alters membrane structures. Thus, SorY is indeed induced by various stresses, but strongest induction was observed in response to singlet oxygen.",

This reporter construct was conjugated into cells either containing a vector control, or having SorY expressed from the 16S rRNA promoter. For reporter fusions harbouring sequences of RSP_2400, sufC, adhI and flgF the differences in b-galactosidase activity to the control strain were not significant, indicating no direct interaction of SorY with these mRNAs (Fig. S2). For RSP_0097, however, a 2-fold decrease of b-galactosidase activity was observed when SorY was overexpressed, indicating a direct interaction of the 2 RNAs (Fig. 3B). RSP_0097 encodes TakP (previously named SmoM), an extracytoplasmic solute receptor of a TRAP transporter suggested to transport a-keto acids. 25 Figure 1. Induction of the small RNA SorY under various stress conditions shown by northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from R. sphaeroides. SorY fold changes (FC) are normalized to the 5S rRNA. The quantification was done with Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad). (A) The following reagents (and their final concentrations) were added to aerobically grown cultures at OD 600 of 0.4 and samples were taken immediately before (time 0) or 10 min after addition: 0.2 mM methylene blue in the presence of 800 Wm \u00a12 white light, 300 mM tBOOH, 1 mM H 2 O 2 and 250 mM paraquat were added to aerobically grown cultures at OD 0.4 and samples were taken before and 10 min after the addition. (B) Semiaerobic cultures were shifted to 42 C at time 0 or the following reagents were added: 500 mM diamide, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM CdCl 2 , 2.5 % ethanol, 1 mg/mL polymyxin-B or 0.005 % SDS along with 1 mM EDTA. (C) Altered SorY transcript levels in the overexpression strains and the knockout mutant (2.4.1DSorY) before and after 1 O 2 stress in comparison to the wild-type strain harboring the empty vector (2.4.1pBBR). SorY transcription in plasmid born overexpression strains is either constitutive due to the use of a 16S rRNA promoter (2.4.1pBBRSorY) or inducible due to the RpoHI/II dependent promoter of SorY (2.4.1pBBRSorYi).",

However in most cases mRNA stability and consequently the mRNA level is also affected if the rate of translation is altered by an sRNA. Therefore the half-life of the takP mRNA was determined in a control strain (2.4.1pBBR) and in strain 2.4.1pBBRSorY, which constitutively overexpressed the sRNA. A clear difference in the decay rates was observed for the 2 strains (Fig. 2B). When only taking into account the initial phase of decay, which followed a logarithmic kinetic, the half-life was about 1.6 min for the control strain but only about 1 min for the strain overexpressing SorY. This effect of SorY on takP mRNA half-life hints at a direct interaction of the 2 RNAs, which leads to destabilization of the target mRNA.",

To further prove a direct interaction between SorY and takP mRNA in vivo we exchanged single nucleotides in the SorY sequence and tested the effect of the mutations on takP expression in the reporter system. SorY sequences with point mutations at positions C39, C49 or C52 had a significantly smaller effect on takP expression than the wild type sequence (Fig. 3B). While overexpression of wild type SorY decreased expression levels of the takP reporter to about 50%, expression in the single mutants was only reduced to 75-85 %.

We used the IntaRNA tool to predict a putative interaction of the mRNAs transcribed from these genes and SorY. Predicted energy values and locations of the interaction sites are listed for genes deceeding a predicted energy value of \u00a110 kcal/mol  respectively, binding to the corresponding mutated SorY counterparts could not be restored as we did not observe any significant decrease in b-galactosidase activity. The lack of restoration is most likely due to altered secondary structure of the sRNA after single nucleotide exchanges, which in all cases leads to an extended stem-loop in the sRNAs seed region (Fig. S3). Moreover, predicted energy values for the interaction of mutated SorY with corresponding compensatory mutated takP do not reach the value predicted for the original sequence (Table S1). We also tested the effect of the wild type SorY on the takP reporter with point mutations at position \u00a120 or \u00a117. Both point mutations led to a significantly smaller effect of SorY on reporter expression in comparison to the reporter plasmid with the original takP sequence.To further confirm the interaction of SorY with takP, the takP::lacZ reporter plasmid was used to measure b-galactosidase activity in a SorY and hfq deletion strain in relation to their isogenic wild type strain. In both strains expression levels of the takP reporter increased about 50% (Fig. 3C). In total these results support the view that SorY reduces takP mRNA levels in an Hfq-dependent manner.

            "text": "RSs1543, now designated SorY, was originally identified as an sRNA, which is induced in R. sphaeroides by 1 O 2 . Transcription from an RpoHI/RpoHII dependent promoter 26 suggested the influence of several stress factors on SorY accumulation which was confirmed in this study. Agents leading to membrane stress like ethanol and polymyxin B had no effect on SorY expression. Addition of ROS or reagents leading to ROS formation resulted in SorY induction, which was also observed in response to heat, salt or CdCl 2 . Non-redox-reactive heavy metals like cadmium can bind thiol groups causing glutathione depletion and oxidation of sulfhydryl groups in proteins and consequently leading to oxidative stress. RpoHI/RpoHII of R. sphaeroides were previously shown to be activated by photooxidative stress caused by strong blue light, 30 the presence of methylene blue and light, 9,15,26 or by heat shock. 10 The focus of this study is on the role of SorY in the photooxidative stress response. To understand how SorY can affect this response, we searched for putative interaction partners and confirmed the takP mRNA as a direct target of SorY. The functional interaction of SorY and takP was confirmed by i) a decreased half-life of the takP mRNA when SorY is overexpressed, ii) the effect of SorY on takP expression in a reporter gene system in vivo, iii) a dose dependent shift caused by direct binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assays in vitro, iv) a similar phenotype of SorY overexpression and a takP deletion strain and v) failure of SorY to influence stress resistance in a takP deletion mutant. Whether a decreased takP half-life in the presence of SorY overexpression is due to a recruitment and cleavage of RNases or due to fewer protective ribosomes present on the mRNA, was not further investigated. The results achieved with reporter assays suggest that SorY decreases takP stability/translation in an Hfq dependent manner, since the reporter activity is strongly decreased by SorY overexpression but strongly increased in SorY or Hfq deletion strains. Single nucleotide exchanges in SorY, predicted to weaken the interaction between the 2 RNAs, indeed diminished the effect of SorY on takP expression in those assays, further supporting the view that both RNAs interact directly. It was however not possible to reverse the effect of the mutations by introducing compensatory mutations, which is most likely due to an extended stem-loop in the sRNA seed regions after each single nucleotide exchange and lower predicted energy values for the interaction of mutated SorY with corresponding compensatory mutated takP. SorY overexpression led to an increased resistance, whereas deletion of SorY resulted in higher sensitivity against 1 O 2 . This effect was clearly dependent on presence of Hfq and TakP. Thus SorY confers resistance to 1 O 2 stress by a negative regulation of takP expression in an Hfq-dependent manner. Since overexpression of SorY in the takP deletion strain did not affect resistance at all, we conclude that takP is the primary target of SorY promoting resistance under these experimental conditions.",

            "text": "Our results raised the question how SorY influences stress resistance by affecting takP expression. In a wild type strain expression of takP is about 2-fold down-regulated upon exposure to 1 O 2 . 17 Studies on R. sphaeroides TakP were initiated due to the higher selenite resistance of a TakP mutant strain. Binding of a-keto acids to this protein was confirmed in vitro and the structure of TakP binding pyruvate was solved. 25 The natural ligand of TakP is still unknown 25 and lack of pyruvate in our growth medium excluded the possibility that the phenotype of the takP mutant was due to altered pyruvate import. Therefore we considered malate to be the possible ligand for takP, which was the main carbon source in our medium. One of the TakP homologues in Rhodobacter capsulatus, DctP3 (RCAP_rcc03024), was shown in vivo to be needed for the uptake of the C4-dicarboxylates malate, succinate, and fumarate. 28,29 To confirm that resistance to 1 O 2 conferred by an overexpression of SorY or a deletion of takP, is due to altered malate import, we performed zone of inhibition assays with growth media containing an equimolar concentration of lactate as main carbon source. Lactate medium led to slower cell growth and higher resistance towards 1 O 2 in comparison to malate medium. Using lactate as main carbon source abolished the effects of takP deletion, SorY overexpression or SorY deletion on resistance against 1 O 2 . We conclude that resistance to 1 O 2 is conferred by down-regulation of TakP levels by SorY and consequently decreased malate import.",

            "text": "Malate is an intermediate of the TCA cycle. A tight regulation of its uptake might be necessary, since very high amounts of malate could be dispensable or even harmful during oxidative stress. Several studies reported during the last years that oxidative stress redirects the metabolic flux from the glycolytic pathway to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and Entner-Doudoroff pathway (ED), while the fluxes associated with the TCA cycle are decreased. This metabolic shift leads to decreased production of NADH which can increase oxidative stress by transferring electrons to oxygen and increased production of NADPH in the PPP and ED, an important component in the oxidative stress defense. [31][32][33][34][35] Also up-regulation of some glycolytic enzymes, i.e. fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and glucose-6-P-isomerase was observed in E. coli during oxidative stress, which then leads to a glyoxylate shunt and subsequent decrease of NADH production. 32,36,37 During menadione-induced ROS generation accumulation of pyruvate and malate, intermediates of the TCA cycle, was observed. 38 We reanalyzed a previous transcriptome study in R. sphaeroides (Table S2) with respect to changes in the central carbon metabolism in response to 1 O 2 , which has not been reported for this organism so far. Our data revealed 1 O 2 to reduce expression of genes for some components of the TCA cycle, like genes for succinyl-CoA synthetase (sucC, sucD) and fumarate hydratase (fumC). At the same time genes for the pentose phosphate pathway and Entner-Doudoroff pathway like glucose-6-P-dehydrogenase (zwf), 6-phosphogluconolactonase (pgl), 2-keto-3-deoxyphosphogluconate aldolase (eda) are induced (Table S2). Additional expression of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (pgi), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (glpX) and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (fbaB) is induced to produce glucose-6-phosphate in gluconeogenesis, which then can be metabolized in ED and PPP to produce NADPH. 8,17,39 Interestingly, it was also shown that all the induced genes of ED, PPP and gluconeogenesis except glpX are part of the RpoHII regulon as is SorY. 10,40 Moreover downregulation of sucC and sucD is also reliant on RpoHII. 10 In Figure 5 we present a model for the effect of SorY on the metabolic flux and consequently on stress resistance in R. sphaeroides. To combat oxidative stress the alternative sigma factor RpoE and subsequently RpoHII are activated. RpoHII induces the genes zwf, pgl, eda to switch from glycolysis to PPP and ED to reduce production of NADH and increase NADPH levels. In addition RpoHII triggers pgi and fbaB expression to strengthen gluconeogenesis. At the same time flux through the TCA cycle, which generates excessive amounts of the prooxidant NADH, is decreased by an RpoHII dependent downregulation of the genes sucC and sucD. In addition Rpo-HII also induces expression of the sRNA SorY, which regulates TakP synthesis negatively to decrease high but harmful malate influx into the cell and the TCA cycle respectively. This represents a novel mechanism by which an sRNA confers resistance to 1 O 2 . Other sRNA were reported to contribute in the oxidative stress response by mechanisms differing from that of SorY function. In R. sphaeroides PcrZ counteracts the strong increase of photosynthetic gene expression upon a drop in oxygen tension 4 and therefore also bacteriochlorophyl a mediated generation of 1 O 2 . In Enterobacteria the sRNA OxyS is induced upon exposure to H 2 O 2 and negatively influences translation of the transcription factor FhlA and of the stationary phase specific alternative sigma factor RpoS for the benefit of the oxidative stress response. 41,42 Furthermore, a tight regulation of iron availability in E. coli by the sRNA RyhB 43 and its homologues, e.g. in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 44 and Erwinia chrysanthemi 45 contributes to the defense against ROS, which are generated in the Fenton reaction. 46,47 In Enterobacteria sRNAs like MicF, MicC and CyaR are involved in changing the outer membrane composition in response to oxidative stress. 36,48,49 However, SorY is the first example of an sRNA providing resistance during photooxidative stress by decreasing import of a carbon source to limit metabolic flux through the TCA cycle.",

For cultivation of R. sphaeroides strains at C, malate minimal-salt medium was used 50 or malate was substituted by an equimolar amount of lactate. To grow the cells aerobically, cultures were either gassed with air in Meplat bottles to attain a concentration of 160 to 180 mM of dissolved oxygen or by continuous shaking of Erlenmeyer flasks containing 20% culture by volume at 140 rpm. For semiaerobic growth conditions, having a dissolved oxygen concentration of about 25 mM, Erlenmeyer flasks containing 80% culture by volume were shaken at 140 rpm. When necessary kanamycin (25 mg ml \u00a11 ), tetracycline (1.5 mg ml \u00a11 ) or spectinomycin (10 mg ml \u00a11 ) was added to liquid and solid growth media (1.6% agar). Photooxidative stress conditions were generated as described earlier, 51 except the final concentration of methylene blue (0.2 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich; M9140). Other stress conditions were generated by a final concentration of 500 mM diamide (Sigma-Aldrich; D3648), 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM CdCl 2 , 2,5% Ethanol (Carl Roth; 5054.3), 1 mg/ml polymyxin-B (Sigma-Aldrich; P4932) or 0.005 % SDS along with 1 mM EDTA.

            "text": "To combat 1 O 2 stress the alternative sigma factor RpoE and subsequently RpoHII are activated in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. RpoHII induces expression of the depicted enzymes for pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), Entner-Doudoroff pathway (ED) and gluconeogenesis to generate the antioxidant NADPH and indirectly represses enzymes for the TCA cycle, which generates the prooxidant NADH. To favor this pathway shunt RpoHII also induces the sRNA SorY. SorY regulates TakP synthesis negatively to limit intermediate availability for the TCA cycle by decreasing malate influx into the cell. This assigns a so far unknown function to a sRNA in oxidative stress response.
