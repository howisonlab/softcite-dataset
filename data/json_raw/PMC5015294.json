In order to identify modifiable perioperative risk factors for AKI, which existing risk scores are insufficient to predict, a dynamic clinical risk score to allow clinicians to estimate the risk of CSA-AKI from preoperative to early postoperative periods is needed. Methods and Results-A total of 7233 cardiac surgery patients in our institution from January 2010 to April 2013 were enrolled prospectively and distributed into 2 cohorts. Among the derivation cohort, logistic regression was used to analyze CSA-AKI risk factors preoperatively, on the day of ICU admittance and 24 hours after ICU admittance. Sex, age, valve surgery combined with coronary artery bypass grafting, preoperative NYHA score >2, previous cardiac surgery, preoperative kidney (without renal replacement therapy) disease, intraoperative cardiopulmonary bypass application, intraoperative erythrocyte transfusions, and postoperative low cardiac output syndrome were identified to be associated with CSA-AKI. Among the other 1152 patients who served as a validation cohort, the point scoring of risk factor combinations led to area under receiver operator characteristics curves (AUROC) values for CSA-AKI prediction of 0.74 (preoperative), 0.75 (on the day of ICU admission), and 0.82 (postoperative), and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests revealed a good agreement of expected and observed CSA-AKI rates. Conclusions-The first dynamic predictive score system, with Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI definition, was developed and predictive efficiency for CSA-AKI was validated in cardiac surgery patients.",

With the development of medical technology, cardiac surgery in developing countries is booming. Meanwhile complications of surgery and economic burdens are also increasing due to restriction of medical technology and management. We aimed to develop a dynamic predictive model for CSA-AKI based on the recent KDIGO AKI definition, which was devised to predict the incidence of CSA-AKI from preoperative to early postoperative periods and to validate its predictive capacity for improved clinical application.",

Not only pre-op risk factors but also the intra-op and post-op risk factors were enrolled in the analysis for better predictive efficiency. The result of our study showed that the predictive value of the dynamic risk scores was close to that of the previous scores and improved as the intra-op (AUC=0.75) and post-op (AUC=0.82) risk factors were admitted into the multivariate regression analysis and the subsequent scores.

CSA-AKI indicates cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury. Male sex and age were risk factors for CSA-AKI in all 3 time points, and with increasing age, the incidence of CSA-AKI also increased. Age-associated AKI was reported to occur more frequently in the elderly due to structural changes such as vascular sclerosis, increased percentages of sclerosing glomeruli, and other degenerative changes that occur with increasing age, 18,19 and our finding is in agreement with other publications from Fang et al, 20,21 who noted that the incidence of CSA-AKI in the older patients was higher than that in younger patients. In our cohort we conducted a subgroup analysis according to the categorized age and found significant differences in CSA-AKI incidence between groups (Figure 3). The risk factor of male sex is in disagreement with other publications in which female sex was a risk factor, 22,23 which needs further analysis.",

Preoperative renal dysfunction was related to CSA-AKI in several other studies. 4,8,23 However, we excluded preoperative RRT patients and also drew the same conclusion. In Table 2, the eGFR was statistically significantly different between AKI and non-AKI cohorts (P<0.01). In the subsequent subgroup analysis, we found significant differences in the incidence of CSA-AKI among subgroups. However, unlike age, categorized eGFR were eliminated through logistic regression. The possible reason may be that we brought many more parameters, such as \"previous kidney disease without RRT,\" into our study in order to improve prediction, so the relationship between eGFR and CSA-AKI could be somehow diluted in the multivariate analysis. Another possible reason was that the kidney function (preoperative serum creatine and eGFR) in our cohorts was better than that of existing model derivation cohorts.",

Preoperative NYHA scores >2, previous cardiac surgery, and postoperative LCOS were also found to be risk factors for CSA-AKI in our study. Among the above factors, preoperative NYHA scores >2 and previous cardiac surgery are not modifiable. The LCOS may result from delayed recovery of post-op cardiac function and cause pulmonary edema and pulmonary infection, which in turn aggravate LCOS in a vicious circle. 30 For those CSA-AKI patients who were unable to eliminate excess fluid and adverse inflammatory factors, either LCOS or pulmonary infection would result in a worse prognosis. Some studies 31 were carried out to break this vicious circle by means of \"perioperative goal-directed hemodynamic resuscitation therapy,\" which was considered to be useful in reducing adverse complications including LCOS as well as 30-day mortality in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",

Although as the economy has developed, and cardiac surgery has become affordable for more patients, its complications are adding to the social economic burden in developing countries. 35,36 Considering the tremendous population in developing countries, this is worthy of concern. The occurrence of valve surgery is becoming higher in developing countries such as China than it was in previous risk stratification development centers, in which CABG is the major procedure (Table 6). This change may be due to the lack in early diagnosis and imbalanced distribution of medical resources; it is also one of the reasons why CSA-AKI incidence was high in our cohort. Compared to CABG, the pathophysiology and pathological impairment are diversified. Patients who undergo valve surgery typically demonstrate low stroke volume related to regurgitation, which increases the vulnerability of the kidney to injury during cardiac surgery. The comorbidities in developing countries such as China are also different from those in the Western population. In our derivation cohort, the ratios of hypertension and diabetes mellitus are also remarkably lower than those in the previous developmental populations (Table 6).",

Embedding these scores into the electronic medical record (EMR) system may improve their clinical practical utility.",
