Materials and Methods: For 413 users of HMV, retrospective reviews of PM&R interventions and survey of HMV methods employed from Mar 2000 to Dec 2009. Results: Of the 413 users, the majority of whom with progressive neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) (n=358), 284 patients initially used noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), while 63 others who were using tracheostomy mechanical ventilation switched to NIV as part of their rehabilitation. The NMD patients began HMV at an earlier age (34.9\u00b120.3 yrs), and used for longer (14.7\u00b17.5) hours than patients with non-neuromuscular causes of respiratory impairment. Conclusion: Noninvasive management was preferred over invasive ones, and transition to the former was a result of PM&R interventions.",

            "text": "Advances in medical care have resulted in more patients requiring long-term home mechanical ventilation (HMV), and all too often results in ventilator users left with tracheostomy tubes without physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) interventions. 1 The cornerstone of PM&R intervention is pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). While most of the clinical care of pulmonary disease is limited to medical treatments, PR deals with a comprehensive intervention, based on a thorough patient assessment, followed by patient-tailored therapies, which include exercise training, education and behavioral changes designed to improve physical and psychological condition of people with chronic respiratory diseases. 2 PR has long been directed to improving the medical and functional status of patients with parenchymal lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 3 however, similar principles have generally been ignored for patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). These measures can also be of value for patients with NMDs. In addition, the use of inspiratory and expiratory muscle aids, including noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) and mechanically assisted coughing (MAC), can facilitate the decannulation of invasively managed ventilator users to more desirable subjects air stacking, 7 and the expiratory phase assisted by application of an abdominal thrust. 8 5) The ventilatory status was monitored by arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) or by monitoring oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) and end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) via oximetry and capnometry (Microcap plus, Oridion Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel) just before HMV prescription, while using mechanical ventilation. For those who could not perform 1)-4) due to intubation or a tracheostomy tube as well as intolerance of breathing with the tube transiently capped for the measurement, the same test was performed after the decannulation or extubation.",

NIV is currently identified as a preferred ventilation strategy and recommended only if the basic requirements such as proper swallowing function, basic cooperation, and ability of self-expectoration are fulfilled. 11,12 Despite the advantages, ventilation via tracheostomy still accounts for the highest percentage in NMDs worldwide. 1,5 Total number of progressive NMD patients is also high in this study.
