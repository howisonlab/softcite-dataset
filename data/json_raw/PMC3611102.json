Cardiopulmonary fitness is also considered to be related to these comorbidities. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and cardiopulmonary fitness by performing a 3-minute step test in a Korean non-diabetes mellitus (DM) population. Methods: A total of 118 non-DM subjects were enrolled during their routine health checkup. Insulin resistance was measured by calculating homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and a 3-minute step test was performed to measure cardiopulmonary fitness.",

            "text": "Cardiopulmonary fitness, also called cardiopulmonary endurance or aerobic fitness, is the ability to exercise continuously been validated in many studies. [2][3][4][5] Increased cardiopulmonary fitness is known to reduce the risk of cardio-metabolic diseases. [6][7][8][9][10] It has been reported that low cardiopulmonary fitness is an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. Cardiopulmonary fitness is considered to affect these co-morbidities by regulating cardiac output and blood pressure. 11) Furthermore, the association between cardiopulmonary fitness and insulin resistance has been reported in adults with DM or healthy young adolescents. 10,[12][13][14] Although, the precise role of cardiopulmonary fitness in insulin resistance has not been fully elucidated, increased cardiopulmonary fitness is thought to influence the expression of the glucose transporter and insulin signaling pathway. However, there are no current studies that evaluate the association between insulin resistance and cardiopulmonary fitness in the adult population without a history of DM. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and cardiopulmonary fitness by performing a 3-minute step test in non-DM patients of a university hospital in Korea. ",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the relationship between insulin resistance and cardiopulmonary fitness in an adult population without a history of DM. The precise underlying mechanisms that explain the relationship between cardiopulmonary fitness and insulin resistance have remained uncertain. However possible mechanisms have been proposed. Current reviews suggested that an active lifestyle has favorable effects on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity through several mechanisms involving an increased level of the glucose transporter (GLUT)-4 protein, which is the main isoform in skeletal muscles involved in the uptake of glucose through insulin stimulation. Cardiopulmonary fitness training increases GLUT-4 concentration in healthy",

After at least 5 minutes resting in a seated position, participants' heart beat was measured using a heart rate monitor before the test. The test began by demonstrating the alternating stepping cadence to the subject: in time with the beat, step one foot up on the bench (1st beat), step up with the second foot (2nd beat), step down with one foot (3rd beat), and step down with the other foot (4th beat.) The subject was allowed to practice the stepping to the metronome cadence, which was set at 96 beats per minute (4 clicks = one step cycle) for a stepping rate of 24 steps per minute. The participants stepped up and down on the platform at the given rate for a total of 3 minutes. The participants",
