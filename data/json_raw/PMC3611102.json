Cardiopulmonary fitness is also considered to be related to these comorbidities. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and cardiopulmonary fitness by performing a 3-minute step test in a Korean non-diabetes mellitus (DM) population. Methods: A total of 118 non-DM subjects were enrolled during their routine health checkup. Insulin resistance was measured by calculating homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and a 3-minute step test was performed to measure cardiopulmonary fitness."

            "text": "Cardiopulmonary fitness, also called cardiopulmonary endurance or aerobic fitness, is the ability to exercise continuously been validated in many studies. [2][3][4][5] Increased cardiopulmonary fitness is known to reduce the risk of cardio-metabolic diseases. [6][7][8][9][10] It has been reported that low cardiopulmonary fitness is an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. Cardiopulmonary fitness is considered to affect these co-morbidities by regulating cardiac output and blood pressure. 11) Furthermore, the association between cardiopulmonary fitness and insulin resistance has been reported in adults with DM or healthy young adolescents. 10,[12][13][14] Although, the precise role of cardiopulmonary fitness in insulin resistance has not been fully elucidated, increased cardiopulmonary fitness is thought to influence the expression of the glucose transporter and insulin signaling pathway. However, there are no current studies that evaluate the association between insulin resistance and cardiopulmonary fitness in the adult population without a history of DM. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and cardiopulmonary fitness by performing a 3-minute step test in non-DM patients of a university hospital in Korea. ",
