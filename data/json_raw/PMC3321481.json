            "text": "Differences in the oscillatory EEG dynamics of reading open class (OC) and closed class (CC) words have previously been found (Bastiaansen et al., 2005) and are thought to reflect differences in lexical-semantic content between these word classes. In particular, the theta-band (4-7 Hz) seems to play a prominent role in lexical-semantic retrieval. We tested whether this theta effect is robust in an older population of subjects. Additionally, we examined how the context of a word can modulate the oscillatory dynamics underlying retrieval for the two different classes of words. Older participants (mean age 55) read words presented in either syntactically correct sentences or in a scrambled order (\"scrambled sentence\") while their EEG was recorded. We performed time-frequency analysis to examine how power varied based on the context or class of the word. We observed larger power decreases in the alpha (8-12 Hz) band between 200-700 ms for the OC compared to CC words, but this was true only for the scrambled sentence context. We did not observe differences in theta power between these conditions. Context exerted an effect on the alpha and low beta (13-18 Hz) bands between 0 and 700 ms. These results suggest that the previously observed word class effects on theta power changes in a younger participant sample do not seem to be a robust effect in this older population. Though this is an indirect comparison between studies, it may suggest the existence of aging effects on word retrieval dynamics for different populations. Additionally, the interaction between word class and context suggests that word retrieval mechanisms interact with sentence-level comprehension mechanisms in the alpha-band.",

            "text": "Understanding the myriad of operations underlying language comprehension in the brain is an ongoing challenge in the field. Neuronal networks supporting these operations must dynamically assemble locally and flexibly communicate across long distances. But how does the brain do this? A growing number of studies on the oscillatory dynamics during language processing are revealing new insights into these mechanisms (for a review, see Bastiaansen and Hagoort, 2006). Oscillatory synchronization is thought to reflect the transient formation of functional brain networks (Varela et al., 2001;Fries, 2005), and this synchronization can be measured through EEG or MEG spectral analysis. Power analysis is thought to reflect the recruitment of local neuronal networks while coherence analysis reflects dynamic linking between brain areas involved in a global network. Additionally, analyzing oscillatory dynamics may reveal a rich set of information that is not currently seen during event-related potential (ERP) analysis because the ERP tends to average out non-phase-locked signals. Thus the study of oscillatory dynamics is a promising method to complement current ERP analysis and examine functional networks for language processing.",

            "text": "The network dynamics of lexical-semantic processing are still not fully understood. Previous studies have indicated that theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) are involved in these networks for lexicalsemantic retrieval. Bastiaansen et al. (2005) observed greater theta power increases between 300 and 500 ms when subjects read open class (OC) words compared to closed class (CC) words in a short story context. Since OC words carry more semantic information than CC words, they are thought to probe lexical-semantic retrieval processing more deeply than CC words. In addition, these authors observed greater alpha (8-12 Hz) power decreases between 300 and 500 ms at right occipitotemporal electrodes for OC than CC words. Thus alpha power decreases may also be related to semantic retrieval. A study comparing nouns with different semantic features (primarily visual vs. auditory) also found differences in theta power increases between 100 and 400 ms (Bastiaansen et al., 2008). The theta effect was larger for the \"visual\" nouns at occipital electrodes while it was larger at temporal electrodes for \"auditory\" nouns suggesting that theta scalp topography reflects the sensory features of the words. Both studies point to a role for theta oscillations in the retrieval of lexical-semantic information, but the robustness of this effect has yet to be fully established.",

            "text": "In the present study, we focus on the role of oscillatory dynamics in retrieving OC vs. CC words. Specifically, we want to investigate the robustness of the previously established theta and alpha effects in different contexts and in a different population. Our motivation stems from how the factors of context and age affect the well-studied N400 ERP component. The N400 is a negative-going potential between 300 and 500 ms that reflects lexical-semantic processing. Evidence shows that the N400 is modulated by both the class (e.g., Van Petten and Kutas, 1991;Nobre and McCarthy, 1994;King and Kutas, 1995;M\u00fcnte et al., 2001) and context of words (e.g., Hillyard, 1980, 1984). An interaction between word class and context has also been reflected in the N400 (Van Petten and Kutas, 1991). Thus we have chosen to experimentally manipulate both word class (OC, CC) and context (sentence, scrambled sentence) in this study to further investigate any interaction between the two factors on the oscillatory dynamics during word reading. Aging also affects the amplitude and latency of the N400 (Harbin et al., 1984;Gunter et al., 1992;Kutas and Iragui, 1998), and could potentially modulate oscillatory responses. So far, the oscillatory dynamics of lexical-semantic processing have not been investigated in an older population (Bastiaansen et al., 2005 tested younger participants, aged 21-28) though the changes in the N400 suggest that there may be changes in the underlying semantic processing mechanisms with age. Hence we have chosen to test in an older population. An additional aim is to examine gamma band (>30 Hz) dynamics. This will extend the previous study on OC and CC words (Bastiaansen et al., 2005) which did not examine gamma oscillations though prior research has suggested that it is involved in lexical-semantic processing (Pulverm\u00fcller et al., 1999;Mainy et al., 2008).",

TFRs were constructed in two different, partially overlapping frequency ranges. In the low-frequency range (2-30 Hz), 2.5-Hz frequency-smoothing and 400 ms time-smoothing Hanning windows were used to compute power changes in frequency steps of 1 Hz and time steps of 10 ms. In the high-frequency range (25-100 Hz), power changes were computed in 2.5-Hz frequency steps and 10 ms time steps, with 2.5-Hz frequency-smoothing and 400 ms time-smoothing discrete prolate spheroidal sequence windows. These calculations were performed starting 500 ms before the word appeared on the screen to 1500 ms after the word onset. We calculated TFRs in two different ways to examine both evoked and induced activity, i.e., oscillatory activity that is both phaselocked and non-phase-locked to the stimuli. For the first method, we calculated the TFRs on individual trials and averaged across those trials; this analysis reflects both induced and evoked activity. For the second method, we calculated the ERP by averaging over trials and then calculated the TFRs; this analysis reflects evoked activity only. By performing both types of analysis, we were able to determine if any effects were due to evoked or induced activity.",

While power increases in the theta and gamma bands typically reflect active processing, the opposite is true for the alpha frequency range. Here, power decreases are generally thought to reflect more cortical processing or engagement (e.g., Jokisch and Jensen, 2007;Klimesch et al., 2007). As OC words carry more lexical-semantics than CC words, reading OC words involves more lexical-semantic retrieval. Thus our results support the notion that alpha power decreases may be related to lexical-semantic retrieval operations. Evidence for this relationship comes from several other studies. In their comparison of OC vs. CC words, Bastiaansen et al. (2005) found not only theta power increases but also significant alpha power decreases between 300 and 500 ms at right posterior channels. The topography of our alpha effect looks remarkably similar to the topography found in their study. This suggests that alpha reflects similar processes in both studies. Studies of semantic judgment tasks have further implicated the involvement of alpha power decreases with semantic processing (Klimesch et al., 1997;R\u00f6hm et al., 2001; reviewed in Klimesch, 1999). Evidence from several studies also suggests that alpha power decreases can reflect increased attention (see Klimesch, 1999 for a review). It is unlikely that there were greater attentional demands in reading OC words compared with CC words; thus we favor a semantic interpretation for the word class effect.",

In contrast, our data suggest that theta power may not play a role in lexical-semantic processing in an older population. Instead, for older participants, semantic processing mechanisms may rely more on alpha oscillatory dynamics. We want to emphasize that the comparison of these effects across the two different studies is indirect and qualitative at best. Our study cannot speak directly to aging effects in the theta and alpha-bands but rather suggests the existence of aging effects, a suggestion that should be further investigated by a direct comparison between two age groups in a subsequent study. Still a comparison between the studies is warranted as they used similar stimuli (open and closed class words in a sentence context presented at the same duration and rate as our study) and tasks (participants were instructed to read the words and were asked comprehension questions). Two main differences were the inclusion of a second variable in our study, that of context (Bastiaansen et al., 2005 did not present words outside of a sentence context), and the languages of presentation (Dutch vs. English). There is no evidence that oscillatory dynamics differ based on the testing language.",

Thus it is possible that we are observing an effect of aging in the shift from theta-band effects to alpha-band effects though this cannot be said with more confidence without younger controls. Ultimately, the previously established theta power increase does not appear to be a robust phenomenon related to lexical-semantic retrieval in all populations. Further work directly comparing these different populations within the same study would lend more support to the hypothesis that decreases in theta power during lexical-semantic processing are related to aging.",

            "text": "The observation that alpha and beta power was smaller for words in a sentence than a scrambled sentence between 0 and 700 ms suggests that context modulates the oscillatory dynamics in these bands. A methodological challenge exists, however, in interpreting this context effect. Since our time-frequency analysis computed all power changes relative to pre-word baselines, the post-word differences observed in the sentence-scrambled sentence contrast may have two possible causes: (1) the processingrelated differences of these words, and (2) the processing-related differences in the baseline periods before each open or closed www.frontiersin.org  class word. The reason for these baseline differences is that the baseline power in the sentence context is likely to be influenced by sentence-level processes such as syntactic parsing, semantic integration, working memory demands, or even attentional demands. These processes are probably not (or at least to a lesser extent) engaged in the scrambled sentence context which leads to the possible differences in baseline power between sentence and scrambled sentence conditions. Therefore, as this comparison was not ideally controlled, we would feel it misleading to interpret the alpha and beta power changes as specifically reflecting one of these sentence-level processes. Further work with more tightly controlled conditions could help disambiguate the observed context main effects.",

(2005) only included words within a sentence context; thus it was not clear if the observed effects solely reflected word-level processing or may include sentence-level processing also. In order to examine how reading words of different class may be affected by context, we inspected the interaction between these factors. We followed up the marginally significant interaction with simple effects tests of OC-CC in the scrambled sentence context and OC-CC in the sentence context and only found a significant effect for the contrast in the scrambled sentence context. Thus the class effect observed in the scrambled sentence context does not show up in the sentence context. This might indicate that the main effect of class is driven mainly by words in the scrambled sentence context and therefore primarily reflects word retrieval mechanisms. But alpha power decreases are present in both main effects of word class and context which suggests that alpha is driven by both word retrieval and sentence processing. We tentatively propose that an interaction between word class and context arises because the class effect is being obscured by sentence-level processing such that it is not seen in the sentence context. As mentioned above, alpha power decreases have been previously linked to attentional processing (see Klimesch, 1999 for a review). Thus one possibility is that larger attention-related alpha decreases in the sentence context may make it difficult to reliably detect the additional alpha decreases due to word class differences, at least not as clearly as observed in the scrambled sentence context. Thus greater attentional allocation during sentence reading than during scrambled sentence reading may be \"swamping\" the class effect.",

However, we did not observe significant gamma power changes between OC and CC words. Since a relationship between gamma power increases and sentence-level semantic unification/integration has previously been observed (Hagoort et al., 2004;Hald et al., 2006;Pena and Melloni, 2011), this absence of gamma band effects might suggest that processing lexical-semantics relies partly on different neuronal mechanisms from processing sentence-level semantics. The current literature suggests that the neuronal dynamics of lexicalsemantic processing may be confined to the lower frequencies, as opposed to previously observed sentence-level semantic processes which are situated in the gamma frequency range. However, more work is needed to further substantiate such a claim.",

In comparing OC and CC words to examine differences in semantic content, it must be remembered that these word classes naturally have different frequencies and lengths. While we did see significant differences in both frequency and length, evidence is currently lacking that these variables affect oscillatory dynamics. Bastiaansen et al. (2005) did not find that word frequency influenced the amplitude of oscillatory responses. Thus, it is probably unlikely that any word frequency difference would influence our power results. Another potential confound is repetition effects as we had more repetitions for CC words than OC words. We did try to minimize this repetition and maximize exposure to a variety of CC words by including 69 unique CC words, but more repetition for CC words naturally reflects the higher word frequency of CC words. To our knowledge, there are no published reports of repetition effects on oscillatory dynamics during visual word processing with repetition lags greater than one (as we had here).",
