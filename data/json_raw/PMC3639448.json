            "text": "One of the most disputed issues in primate evolution and thus of our own primate roots, is the phylogenetic position of the Southeast Asian tarsier. While much molecular data indicate a basal place in the primate tree shared with strepsirrhines (prosimian monophyly hypothesis), data also exist supporting either an earlier divergence in primates (tarsier-first hypothesis) or a close relationship with anthropoid primates (Haplorrhini hypothesis). The use of retroposon insertions embedded in the Tarsius genome afforded us the unique opportunity to directly test all three hypotheses via three pairwise genome alignments. From millions of retroposons, we found 104 perfect orthologous insertions in both tarsiers and anthropoids to the exclusion of strepsirrhines, providing conflict-free evidence for the Haplorrhini hypothesis, and none supporting either of the other two positions. Thus, tarsiers are clearly the sister group to anthropoids in the clade Haplorrhini.",

Conflicting or weak phylogenetic signals may suggest more than one possible solution depending on marker systems, partitions of data, method and model of reconstruction, or the selected set of compared species. The reasons for controversies can be variable and often are due to polymorphisms of characters in populations before their speciation or to hybridization, but more often to lineage-specific accumulation of noise (random mutations) at the organismal and molecular levels. Lineages formally rich in both individuals and species and then reduced to a few remaining representatives are especially exposed to bottleneck effects, apparently diverging them from the general characteristics of related species.",

            "text": "The Southeast Asian tarsier (Tarsiiformes: Primates) is one example of such a phylogenetic history. The once species-rich Eocene tarsiers were broadly distributed over the Holarctic region, but today are restricted, with just one surviving genus and 11 species, to a few refuges in Southeast Asia. During the last decades of phylogenetic reconstructions, tarsiers have ''jumped'' from one phylogenetic branch to another (Figure 1): once to split off from primates before the Anthropoidea-Strepsirrhini split (tarsier-first hypothesis 1,2 ), then close to strepsirrhines in the Prosimii clade (prosimian monophyly hypothesis 3,4 ), then in the immediate vicinity of monkeys and apes (haplorrhine hypothesis [5][6][7] ), or to land in an unresolvable trichotomy of strepsirrhines, tarsiers, and anthropoids 8 . These different positions on the evolutionary tree span a phylogenetic era of some 20 million years. With more recent large-scale sequencing efforts, it seemed to be over with such ''great leaps''. Compelling support fixed tarsiers on a common branch with strepsirrhines in a joined group of prosimians 9 . While this study, based on more than 10 kb of sequence information, provided one of the most important and influential mammalian phylogenies, subsequent data would show that it failed significantly in this particular part of the primate tree. The reason was rather simple and was later revealed after sequencing of the mitochondrial genome of Tarsius bancanus 10 (a species recently renamed Cephalopachus bancanus 4 ); the nucleotide composition of mitochondrial genes changed drastically on the lineage leading to anthropoids from high AT to a significant accumulation of GC nucleotides. Consequently, most mitochondrial phylogenies of primates artificially formed the clade Prosimii, based on their shared high mitochondrial AT nucleotide content, apart from the GC-rich genes of higher primates. The mixed nuclear/mitochondrial sequence data used in the Murphy et al. 9 study, yielded the same problematic results because the major nuclear dataset contributed only weak phylogenetic signals to counter the strong mitochondrial noise. At that time most molecular evolutionists confirmed the significant mitochondrial grouping of strepsirrhines and tarsiers (i.e., the prosimian monophyly hypothesis). Molecular geneticists attempted to improve the sequence-based phylogenetic reconstruction methods to compensate for artificial sequence effects. As reviewed in Goodman et al. 11 , sequence-based evidence for the position of tarsiers was still ambiguous, and mitochondrial supermatrix approaches continued to group tarsiers with strepsirrhines 3 . However, the hitherto largest comparative genomic analysis of primate species, involving 186 representatives and about 8 MB of sequence, found some support for the Haplorrhini clade (haplorrhine hypothesis 12 ). Furthermore, a recent analysis of genomic data provided statistically significant data to reject a prosimian monophyly 13 . The currently popular coalescence-based genome analysis method also supports the Haplorrhini clade 14,15 . Zietkiewicz et al. 16 compared Alu element sequences derived from strepsirrhines, tarsiers, and human genomes and found that tarsier elements cluster with human Alu subfamilies and show RNA secondary structure elements absent in strepsirrhines; however, this sequence similarity analysis of Alu elements is not quite as reliable as the highly informative content of retroposon presence/absence analyses.",

Independent of nucleotide composition effects, evolutionary rate variation, saturation of substitutions, etc., the comparison of orthologous insertions of retroposed elements provides a noise-free evaluation of phylogenetic affiliations. An exactly shared retroposon insertion is characterized by specific target site duplications (TSD) of 5-30 nucleotides flanking the insertion site produced during the insertion process 18 . Similar shared TSDs together with an identical retroposon with the identical length and identical orientation in two species strongly indicates an insertion event in their common ancestor, and thus their close relatedness; conversely, an empty insertion site in one or the other indicates more distantly related species.",

Such a clear and conflict-free pattern is not always evident from retroposon data. Ancestral polymorphisms of retroposons and subsequent speciation before fixation may lead to conflicting signals of relationships, as was previously demonstrated for the three main lineages of placental mammals (Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Boreotheria) 22,23 . Although such examples of conflicting retroposon patterns are rare, they are invaluable for diagnosing zones of incomplete lineage sorting or ancestral hybridization effects that influence the evolutionary patterns of species.",

The previous retroposon insertion data supporting the Haplorrhini hypothesis 7 was likely biased by screening only human genome data and a clear rejection of the prosimian monophyly and tarsiers-first hypotheses were lacking; both of these limitations have now been overcome. Many molecular sequence studies demonstrated support for the prosimian monophyly based on data that appeared to be significant 3,9,24,25 but were likely artificial signals connected to the dominance of mitochondrial data 10 . The strong but artificial mitochondrial noise and missing nuclear signals challenged the use of sequence data in certain mammalian branches.

Such pairwise or 2-way alignments were organized in 'axt alignment format' (compiling alignment blocks with genomic coordinates for both the primary organism (first sequence) and aligning organism (second sequence)) 34 . Alignment gaps (e.g., caused by an insertion of an Alu SINE, LINE, or LTR element in the genome of one species) were recognized by interrupted coordinates (Figure 3a; e.g., human coordinates chromosome 2_227644827-227645114 (287 nt insert) vs. bushbaby coordinates of GL873532 (reverse complement) 6388296, 6388295 (no insert).

Such loci were projected/compared to a second and third 2-way alignment of human/bushbaby and human/mouse lemur. Loci with elements present in human, present in strepsirrhine, but absent in tarsier were extracted for closer inspection. Again, the complete loci were extracted via the UCSC MULTIZ alignment by querying the human coordinates and settings.",

To test the third potential hypothesis (prosimian monophyly hypothesis), with tarsiers and strepsirrhines on one branch, we applied a slightly different strategy because tarsier/strepsirrhine pairwise alignments are not yet available. For this search we (a) started with a 2-way alignment of human/bushbaby and human/mouse lemur and derived all loci with a gap of 100-400 nt in human and an orthologous Alu SINE, LINE, or LTR insertion in strepsirrhines. (b) The pairwise alignment of human/tarsier was correspondingly screened for Alu SINE, LINE, and LTR insertions in tarsier. (c) We analyzed the two sets of selected alignments for overlapping coordinates in human. (d) We extracted and merged all corresponding sequences. (e) Loci with elements present in both tarsier and strepsirrhines but absent in human and an insertion sequence similarity of more than 70% were manually inspected. With this screening we examined the potential shared evolution of tarsiers and strepsirrhines.",
