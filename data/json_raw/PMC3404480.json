In settings where large numbers of children receive only one or two vaccine doses rather than the recommended three doses, dose-specific efficacy estimates are needed to predict impact. The objective of this meta-analysis is to determine Hib vaccine efficacy against different clinical outcomes after receiving one, two or three doses of vaccine. Studies were eligible for inclusion if a prospective, controlled design had been used to evaluate commercially available Hib conjugate vaccines. Eight studies were included. Pooled vaccine efficacies against invasive Hib disease after one, two or three doses of vaccine were 59 %, 92% and 93 %, respectively. The meta-analysis provides robust estimates for use in decision-analytical models designed to predict the impact of Hib vaccine.",

While 89 countries used the vaccine in 2004, the number had increased to 172 countries by 2011 [2]. In low-and lower-middleincome countries, introduction of the vaccine has to a large extent been facilitated by support from the GAVI Alliance [3].",

            "text": "The first Hib vaccine was produced in the early 1970s and composed of purified Hib capsular polysaccharide. However, since this vaccine was only effective in children aged >2 years it was not widely used [4]. More immunogenic vaccines were developed in the late 1980s by conjugating capsular polysaccharides to protein carriers. Four different Hib conjugate vaccines have been developed, diverging in the carrier protein, the method of conjugation, and in the structure and lengths of the polysaccharide polyribosolribitol phosphate (PRP) element [4]. The four vaccine types are known as PRP-D, PRP-OMP, HbOC and PRP-T. The PRP-D vaccine was licensed following a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Finnish children [5], but when it subsequently proved ineffective in preventing Hib disease in Alaskan natives [6], production was stopped. Hence, today only the other three vaccines are in use. While the World Health Organization does not differentiate between the three vaccines [7], they are not identical ; for example, PRP-OMP induces a substantial antibody response after a single dose while PRP-T and HbOC require two doses [8].",

If possible, other factors, such as late vaccination, should also be incorporated into estimates of the direct effect of a vaccination programme [11]. Moreover, with more new vaccines being introduced, such as pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines, the routine vaccination schedule is being questioned with regard to the appropriate age and timing of vaccination [12]. Pooled dose-specific efficacy estimates from all RCTs are a crucial piece of information needed to guide these considerations. One other meta-analysis of Hib vaccine RCTs was identified before the present review was started. Obonyo & Lau searched the literature until 2005 and included eight studies, two of which were of the PRP-D vaccine [13]. The pooled efficacy estimate against invasive Hib disease was found to be 84 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 70-99]. As is common in the reporting of vaccine trial results, few dose-specific values were presented.",

These can either be a prospective cohort study, a casecontrol study, or data can be accumulated retrospectively from routine surveillance. For establishing Hib vaccine effectiveness the case-control method, where a group of cases with the target outcome, most frequently Hib meningitis, is contrasted with a group of controls who did not develop the target outcome, is the most commonly used method [14]. An important challenge of case-control studies is, however, to produce convincing evidence that the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations are sufficiently alike in all relevant characteristics other than vaccination to allow a reasonable conclusion that the differences between groups are attributable to vaccine efficacy. A meta-analysis of Hib vaccine effectiveness studies was published by O'Loughlin et al. in 2010 [14]. Twenty-five studies, of which 14 were case-control studies, were identified. Three of the studies reported vaccine effectiveness against invasive Hib disease after three doses and the pooled estimate was 95 % (95 % CI 82-99). One of the conclusions from this review was that the effectiveness of Hib vaccine has been well documented and the need for more case-control studies is minimal [14].",

Noninvasive disease occurs when Hib has been isolated from a non-sterile site, such as an external ear or throat swab. All severe types of Hib diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, epiglottitis and sepsis, are invasive. However, the aetiology of invasive pneumonia is intrinsically difficult to determine [18]. The only method which would reliably determine the aetiology is culture of lung aspirate, but this procedure is invasive and not ethically feasible in all RCTs. Moreover, selection bias will occur if antibiotics are commonly used before seeking healthcare as this will markedly reduce the sensitivity of the lung aspirate test [19]. Blood culture is only useful when pneumonia is associated with bacteraemia, which is only in a fraction of cases. The yield from blood culture in patients with Hib pneumonia has ranged from 10 % to 30% [20,21]. Hence, since there are currently no validated and specific methods for confirming the pathogen-specific bacterial aetiology of pneumonia, several non-specific pneumonia endpoints have been used in Hib vaccine RCTs.",

The most common reason for exclusion at this stage was that the study reported only safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine with no clinical endpoints. Fifteen papers were retrieved for full-text review and seven of these were excluded. One of the excluded studies was a  The efficacy of Hib vaccine : a systematic review large, Finnish prospective study where children born on even-numbered days received HbOC vaccine and those born on uneven-numbered days received PRP-D vaccine [24]. Vaccine efficacy was estimated by comparing the number of Hib disease cases during the study period with the number expected based on historical routine surveillance data. The study was excluded because the comparison group was historical, not prospective. Six of the eight included papers evaluated PRP-T, one HbOC and one PRP-OMP vaccines (see Table 1). The studies by Lagos and Levine analysed the same trial participants. Three of the studies were from the USA and the remaining from England, Chile, The Gambia and Indonesia. One of the US studies was conducted in a Navajo Indian reservation, targeting a group with one of the highest incidences of Hib disease in the world [25]. In this trial only two doses of Hib vaccine were administered, while three doses were evaluated in the seven remaining studies. The study by Vadheim ended prematurely due to inclusion of the HbOC vaccine in the US routine vaccination schedule while the study was ongoing, so no vaccine efficacy estimates were reported because the sample sizes were too small to achieve sufficient power. In all the studies, follow-up stopped after a specified time period. The study by Booy had the shortest follow-up time and the study by Mulholland the longest, with the oldest children being aged 18 and 30 months, respectively, when the studies ended (Table 1).",

Since pneumonia disease incidence is considerably less in high-income than low-income countries, non-specific pneumonia endpoints were not relevant to include in the RCTs from England and the USA. However, in low-income countries prevention of pneumonia may be the primary argument for introducing Hib vaccine, so it was crucial for the studies in these countries to measure efficacy against pneumonia.  Table 3. Risks of bias due to randomization, sequence generation and allocation concealment were relatively low in all the studies. Even though two studies were not randomized, it seems unlikely that the results would be biased for this reason. However, four of the studies were not blinded and this leads to risk of bias. In the three studies where confirmed Hib disease was the only endpoint, the risk of bias would most likely be low because the microbiologists undertaking the tests for Hib were not aware of the child's vaccination status. However, in the Levine study, radiological and hospitalized pneumonia were the chosen endpoints and assessments of these were made from hospital records of children with known vaccination status, leading to moderate risk of bias. With regard to inclusion of all randomized participants, all the studies suffer from high risk of bias due to the inherent difficulties of diagnosing Hib. Even in the studies with enhanced surveillance, it is possible that not all Hib cases were detected. The risk of detection bias is especially large in the three studies with non-specific (or all-cause) pneumonia as an outcome. An additional risk of bias in the studies using non-specific pneumonia outcomes is that estimated Hib vaccine efficacy will vary with the relative proportion of Hib pneumonia occurring during the study period. Since many of the other pathogens that cause pneumonia are known to be seasonal, such as for instance respiratory synical virus (RSV) or influenza, this could be a problem. Hib vaccine efficacy against clinical pneumonia would for instance be less in a year with a RSV pneumonia outbreak than in a year with low RSV incidence [26]. Since all the trials lasted for more than one year, seasonal fluctuations might have been evened out to some extent, but the risk of this bias is apparent. This is also an important limitation to bear in mind when generalizing the efficacy values to other settings where the relative proportion of Hib pneumonia may be different.",

This indicated that, in the Indonesian environment, many cases of Hib meningitis were reaching a health facility, but either did not have a lumbar puncture or lumbar puncture was done and found to have the microscopic appearance of meningitis, but for reasons of specimen handling or microbiological procedures, Hib was not cultured.",

With one dose, the pooled estimate was 59 % (95 % CI x20 to 86) and there was only low heterogeneity. Hence, the vaccine efficacy evidence against invasive disease is convincing and robust for all dose regimens. This conclusion is similar to the findings of O'Loughlin and colleagues in their metaanalysis of observational studies [14]. The pooled vaccine effectiveness estimate against invasive Hib disease from three case-control studies was 95 % (95 % CI 82-99) after three doses and 92% (95 % CI 81-97) following two doses. In the meta-analysis of RCTs by Obonyo & Lau, vaccine efficacy against invasive Hib disease after three doses was only 84 % (95 % CI 69-92). The reason for the higher pooled estimate in the new analysis is partly the exclusion of the PRP-D trials, but also that Obonyo & Lau combined all doses into one analysis, so that children receiving only one dose, only two doses and all three doses were included in the same estimate. The evidence for confirmed Hib meningitis and confirmed Hib pneumonia is less robust because few studies report on these, so the pooled estimates are based on small sample sizes, which give wide confidence intervals. As both diseases are contained within the overall group of invasive Hib disease, these efficacy estimates should be used instead of seeking to categorize according to invasive Hib disease type.",

For hospitalized pneumonia the heterogeneity is too large for the efficacy estimate to be meaningful. The large heterogeneity between the Indonesian and Chilean studies may partly be due different case detection methods. Pneumonia detection in Indonesia was based on individual presentation for medical care, but supported by village health workers whose task was to identify children in the community with possible severe respiratory disease and refer them for treatment. By contrast, cases were retrospectively identified from patient records in Chile. Another possible explanation is differences between the two sites in the distribution of non-Hib pneumonia aetiologies. For example, a large burden of RSV infection in one site will lower the measured vaccine effectiveness even if the two sites have similar vaccine-preventable Hib disease incidences, as has been described previously [26]. Consequently, for clinical (rather than microbiologically confirmed) outcomes, vaccinepreventable disease incidence may be a better measure than vaccine efficacy.",

The study authors have proposed several possible explanations why pneumonias with lobar infiltrate or pleural effusion were not preventable with Hib vaccine. First, Hib may not be an important cause of pneumonia in Indonesia ; this seems unlikely, since the vaccinepreventable disease incidence measured against all severe or clinical pneumonias was as high or higher than in other studies [24]. Second, some characteristic of children in South East Asia could lead to a different pneumonia presentation ; this also seems unlikely since many children presented with a lobar infiltrate meeting the WHO case definition. Last, and perhaps most likely, early antibiotic use through selfmedication or early intervention could have modified the evolution of Hib pneumonia [26].",

This was particularly illustrated in the casecontrol study from Bangladesh where chest radiographs were taken of 2679 children with clinical pneumonia [29]. According to per-protocol readings, 17 . 7 % cases were identified as having radiologically confirmed pneumonia. However, when the radiographs were read by a WHO panel, it was concluded that 26 . 0% were radiologically confirmed, and only 13 . 2 % of cases were radiologically confirmed by both per-protocol readings and WHO readings [29]. It is thus difficult to determine which estimate to use, and the choice greatly affects the vaccine effectiveness estimate. When using the per-protocol readings, the preventable fraction for radiologically confirmed pneumonia was 17 % following at least two doses of Hib vaccine. When the WHO readings were used, the vaccine was associated with 15% protection, and when the subset considered positive by both sets of readings was used the vaccine offered 34% protection [29].",

The PRP-OMP vaccine has shown significantly higher immunogenicity after the first dose than the two others in all studies comparing the vaccines [8]. While all three vaccines are indicated for primary infant immunization, PRP-OMP may afford a marginal advantage in populations with high disease burden and carriage prevalence in young infants. For example, in Alaska Native children -who during the pre-vaccine era had among the highest Hib disease incidence rates ever recorded [30] -a change from PRP-OMP to HbOC vaccine in 1996 led to an increase in invasive Hib disease incidence from 19 . 8 to 91 . 1 cases/100 000 children aged <5 years [31]. When the state subsequently switched back to PRP-OMP vaccine, disease incidence decreased to 0/100 000 in 2004 [31]. Nevertheless, most countries in Africa have reported a high Hib disease burden in young infants prevaccine, and yet have achieved and sustained near elimination of Hib disease with PRP-T [32], indicating this vaccine is also appropriate in these situations.",

In theory, then, the routine schedule could be reduced to two instead of three doses. A study evaluating this option found that while PRP-T elicited high immune response after two doses, this was not universally true of PRP-HbOC, with only 87 % of infants reaching seroprotective concentrations [33]. The authors concluded that before switching to a two-dose regimen, additional studies would be needed [33]. These studies have not been conducted, and moreover, additional barriers to a two-dose schedule exist. First, studies would need to confirm vaccine effectiveness against carriage, since indirect protection is a critical component of overall disease reduction and second, additional studies would need to confirm long-term immunity and protection against carriage, as well as booster responses with a two-dose schedule. Programmatically, Hib vaccine is now widely introduced in combination with DTP and other vaccines with a primary three-dose schedule, which has large advantages. For these reasons, it is unlikely that any country would consider a two-dose primary series without a booster. However, if countries were to switch to a 2+1 schedule for pneumococcal vaccines, our analysis supports the use of the same schedule for Hib vaccine.",

Since the medium follow-up time of the studies was only 24 months, they do not provide evidence regarding the long-term protection of the vaccine. While all high-income and some middle-income countries recommend a Hib vaccine booster dose at 12-15 months, this has not been included in immunization schedules in low-income countries. The reason for not including a booster dose is partly due to the increased cost, which is not affordable, but also because the average age of Hib infection is substantially lower in low-income compared to high-income countries [37]. It is, however, extremely important to closely monitor the impact of Hib vaccine in lowincome countries to establish whether a booster dose is also needed in these settings. In South Africa an increase in invasive Hib disease cases was observed several years after a three-dose primary vaccination schedule was commenced. Surveillance data showed that about 60 % of Hib vaccine failures were in HIVnegative children and 55 % occurred in children aged >18 months ; an age group that may benefit directly from a booster dose. In 2010 South African children began receiving a Hib booster [38].",

Although we could not evaluate the effect of different schedules on carriage, this issue is of primary importance, since much of the overall protection against disease afforded by Hib vaccination programmes derives from indirect effects. In the UK, an increase in vaccine failure 8 years after routine vaccination commenced in 1999 was at least partly because of a greater than expected decline in Hib antibody response following a schedule without a booster in the second year of life, which had been masked by the initial vaccination catch-up programme of all children aged <5 years in 1992 [39]. Moreover, the loss of protection against Hib disease in children resulted in a significant increase in adult disease, probably because reduced carriage and transmission in young children had diminished opportunities for natural boosting of immunity in adults, who had very low Hib antibody levels [40]. This suggests that control of carriage and disease in young children has important impact in older children and adults.",
