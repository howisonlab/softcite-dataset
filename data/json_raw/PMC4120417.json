For implementation of telecare to be successful and ensure quality of care, sufficient training for staff (healthcare professionals) and service users (patients) is fundamental. Telecare training has been found to have positive effects on attitudes to, sustained use of, and outcomes associated with telecare. However, the potential contribution of training in the adoption, quality and safety of telecare services is an underinvestigated research field. The overall aim of this study is to develop and evaluate simulation-based telecare training programmes to aid the use of videophone technology in elderly home care. Research-based training programmes will be designed for healthcare professionals, service users and next of kin, and the study will explore the impact of training on adoption, quality and safety of new telecare services. Methods and analysis: The study has a qualitative action research design. The research will be undertaken in close collaboration with a multidisciplinary team consisting of researchers and managers and clinical representatives from healthcare services in two Norwegian municipalities, alongside experts in clinical education and simulation, as well as service user (patient) representatives. The qualitative methods used involve focus group interviews, semistructured interviews, observation and document analysis. To ensure trustworthiness in the data analysis, we will apply member checks and analyst triangulation; in addition to providing contextual and sample description to allow for evaluation of transferability of our results to other contexts and groups. Ethics and dissemination: The study is approved by the Norwegian Social Science Data Services. The study is based on voluntary participation and informed written consent. Informants can withdraw at any point in time. The results will be disseminated at research conferences, peer review journals, one PhD thesis and through public presentations to people outside the scientific community.",

            "text": "The number of individuals in Norway over the age of 80 will have doubled within the next 20-25 years 1 while the predicted number of healthcare professionals available to deliver healthcare services will be far fewer than those needed to cope with demand. 2 3 The rapidly growing population of elderly people in Norway and across the world increases healthcare needs, with more services expected to be delivered at home. 4 5 In order to handle the aging population, significant changes are needed in the way healthcare is delivered. 4 5 Telecare, meaning the use of technology that enables healthcare professionals to remotely care and support home dwelling individuals, promises to be an important solution to the many challenges facing future healthcare services. 6 While it is predicted that telecare and other information and communication technology (ICT)-assisted services will have an increasingly important role in future healthcare services, their implementation in practice is complex. 7 8 There are ergonomics-related barriers and risks associated with the implementation and adoption of telecare, such as healthcare professionals lacking the attitudes, knowledge and skills needed to use the technology as part of healthcare delivery. [9][10][11] This may result in poor quality and safety of healthcare services. [12][13][14] For implementation to be successful and ensure quality of care, staff 15 and organisations 16 17 must be ready to change and adopt innovation. Accordingly, it is widely acknowledged that training of staff (healthcare professionals) and service users ( patients) is fundamental to successful telecare implementation. 9 11 18 Telecare training has been found to have positive effects on attitudes to, sustained use of and outcomes associated with telecare. 10 19-21 Training is recommended as a fundamental part of telecare implementation processes, but there is a lack of targeted staff and service user training programmes for this purpose, and training is not always offered 10 or it is inadequate. 22 A review of telecare education initiatives by Basu et al 23 identified only 10 training courses, none of which were for professionals working in elderly home care services. This lack of pedagogical and professional development models related to telecare applications led Basu et al 23 conclude that education for telecare is an emergent field. Their findings further highlight that telecare training is not simply about learning a new technology; it is about adapting practice to engage with new technology. 23 In addition to technical skills training, it is important, therefore, to focus on the development of the knowledge, skills, attitudes and experiences required for the new ways of working associated with telecare use. 11 22 Awareness raising and training can help motivate health professionals to adopt telecare in their clinical practices. 11 24 Previous research has also demonstrated a lack of training activities focusing on how simulation can be developed and used to improve adoption of technology in the home context. 25 Simulation is considered a powerful tool for the teaching of a range of knowledge and skills necessary for sound clinical practice. Simulation has long been in use within education and training for healthcare professionals to foster both technical and non-technical skills, including communication and interpersonal skills and decision-making abilities. 26 Simulation is largely underpinned by active learning principles that requires participation in and reflection on meaningful activities. 27 The value of simulation as an educational tool that promotes an overall culture of safety and underscores safe and reflexive clinical processes to improve healthcare is acknowledged by many. [28][29][30][31] In an effort to encourage high-quality practices related to new telecare services in the home care arena, it therefore makes sense to utilise simulation in telecare training, as this is lacking in current practice.",

It is the ideal methodology for identifying and improving problems in practice 34 and is increasingly employed in healthcare settings. 35 This study is designed as a cyclic action research project 32 with the aim of developing and evaluating a pilot telecare training programme for elderly service users living at home, their next of kin, and healthcare professionals working in home-based elderly care services. The training programme development depends on problem identification and problem solving, with involvement and input from multiple stakeholders involved in service provision and service use. Action research is participatory research where researchers work with people rather than doing research on them. 35 36 This is crucial in our study as it depends on collaboration and stakeholder involvement, and focuses on generating solutions to practical problems in relation to how to best establish and use a videophone service in home care settings. The videophone will allow for virtual visits in home care services. Not only technical aspects of training related to how to use the equipment are necessary, but health professionals also need to learn about and train for managing ergonomic barriers and risks that may occur as a result of new ways of providing care at home.",

            "text": "The design of the action research approach 32 features five cyclical study phases which allow for a variety of research and evaluation methods to be used within the approach. The five phases are: \u25b8 Diagnosis: identify and define the problem and collect data for further investigation; \u25b8 Action planning: consider courses of action based on initial diagnosis; \u25b8 Implementation: take action according to the specified plan; \u25b8 Evaluation: assess the actions and their consequences; and \u25b8 Learning and refinement: document and interpret cycle outcomes to aid improvement. Although the research process might appear linear and instrumental and conducted step by step in separated phases, it will be in practice a cyclic and iterative process. As described by Susman and Evered 32 the action research approach is characterised by cyclical iterations, with overlap and feedback between the five phases. This cyclical approach implies an openness to for example, change the course of the actions taken to solve the problem based on the evaluation findings, and to consider how unsolved problems from an initial cycle can be taken into account in later iterations of the problem solving process. Research findings will be continuously integrated in the research process in close collaboration between the researchers, representatives from the municipalities and the technology vendor. The municipalities and technology vendor involved in implementing the technology and training programme, will collaborate with researchers in all phases. Consequently, there will be a sound basis for revealing barriers and success factors in the technology design and development, implementation and refinement of the training programme. 32 The following overarching research questions will guide the study: \u25b8 What does the literature identify as risks and challenges associated with the implementation and use of telecare services in home-based elderly care? \u25b8 How can identified training needs of telecare users guide design and development of a simulation-based training programme for service users, next of kin and healthcare professionals working in home care services for the elderly? \u25b8 How can a simulation-based training programme for healthcare professionals, service users and next of kin best be implemented to enable adoption of highquality telecare services in home-based elderly care?",

Understandings of evaluation outcomes can be enhanced by attention to the effectiveness of training, that is, measures of individual, training and organisational variables likely to influence outcomes at various stages of the training process. 37 Our evaluation is interested in assessing training content and design, as well as exploring possible changes in knowledge, attitudes or skills. Effects ascribable to individual and training variables before, during and after training will also be assessed, focusing on participant demographics, experience and abilities, attitudes and expectations, as well as instructional style, practice and feedback. 37 Evaluation will thus focus on participants' opinions on course form and content, whether the training programmes meet needs and expectations, and whether it impacts on perceptions of telecare services, intention to adopt such services in practice and service quality and safety. The evaluation process will run in three stages before, during and after training implementation and will feature qualitative research methods including focus group interviews with healthcare professionals and service users/next of kin, and observation of healthcare professionals and service users during the training sessions.",

According to Susman and Evered, 32 the basis of generalisation in action research is narrow, situational and bound by context. 32 This is also true for our study; however action research encourages transferability of project outcomes to similar settings when appropriate. Depending on contextual similarity, it is possible to judge the relevance of findings from our study and whether they can be applied to another study setting. There is a potential conflict between our purposive sampling and transferability of results to other settings. This will be addressed by providing details of the context in which our research occurs in our publications. Also, we will collect data about our sample regarding for example, their experience with technology, age, gender and education, which we consider of relevance for other studies and populations. This information will also be provided in our publications and enable a better ability to evaluate if our results are transferable to other contextual settings. 38 ",

The reasons for its limited use in telecare studies are unclear but could be related to perceived methodological problems associated with the approach. Issues of context, roles, politics, dynamics and ethics are deeply embedded in the action research method and influence its emergent process, quality and outcomes. 48 The primary strength of the action research methodology as applied to telecare studies is however its ability to actively engage people in research and empower them 35 and it has long been advocated for in telecare studies. 49 It is not uncommon that new telecare technologies fail to see sustained adoption in practice 24 50 51 because intended users seldom get to contribute to development and implementation. 45 The main contribution of our study is therefore new knowledge and experience regarding application of action research in telecare projects. By taking advantage of a combination of user experience, user involvement, collaboration and research evidence, we will develop research-based training programmes more suited for developing both technical and non-technical skills related to use of videophone technology.",

            "text": "Telecare can be considered to be one important solution for future healthcare challenges. 6 However, different parties may have different views and perception of how healthcare services can benefit from implementing new technological tools and changed ways in how healthcare is provided. In this study we need to carefully consider these different views and the fact that participants in both the service user and healthcare professional sample may regard the video telephone as a too complicated tool with an inadequate design, or that communication and service provision via virtual visits is not increasing care quality. Since we have close collaboration with the technology vendor, we will be able to give input to improve technology design, functionality and sound and picture quality based on actual user experience (health professionals and patients). We need to be aware of the contested nature of implementing ICTs in healthcare and we believe our research design opens the way for a continuous dialogue between researchers, technology users and the technology vendor, minimising the risk for low uptake and sustainability in practice. 24 50 51 There is a need to consider both the benefits, challenges and limitations of action research applied to telecare projects and reflect on the role of the action researcher. The action researcher is a researcher acting to increase knowledge and understanding while simultaneously being a facilitator for organisational change. Action research thus implies an inherently dual role for the researcher 52 who needs to be able to move between different roles when needed. 53 This is a possible research challenge and limitation in our project and will require good knowledge of the action research process, alongside comprehensive research skills and an overall flexible and pragmatic approach. It also necessitates the personal skills necessary to foster and handle diverse interpersonal relationships; ability to communicate and negotiate; social and cultural demands; and realistic time keeping. 54 As collaborative problems, such as different assumptions, values and world views between stakeholders, 55 have been demonstrated by others as very disruptive and time consuming to the action research process, they need to be anticipated and openly discussed and managed by participants in the project. 41 This will be solved by organising regular meetings involving all project partners, including the technology vendor, the municipalities and the researchers. In structured meetings we will provide opportunities to discuss and overcome disagreement and collaborative problems in the multistakeholder team. An additional challenge and possible limitation relates to municipal decisionmaking processes not involving research team members but with possible relevance for the project. Decisions related to technology development, technology costs and organisational change processes could emerge as critical for the project. Possible future decisions in the involved municipalities could affect our research project, such as those related to new telecare solutions, new telecare strategies and choice of vendors or IT-related decisions that might interfere with the chosen videophone solution in this project. Moreover, a possible challenge is related to the development of the videophone technology. This is not in the hands of the project team and challenges such as a delay in the production might interfere with our design of training programmes in the action planning phase and the pilot testing in the implementation phase. However, in an attempt to pre-empt such a problem, there are collaborative meetings with members from all work packages in the overall project. In addition, a project team member ( principal researcher: VG) is part of the videophone development group working to guide the development of the final videophone tool, together with representatives from the municipalities and the technology vendor. The research team member was invited by the development team to coordinate the videophone development group, a coordinator role that extends to managing communications between our research project team and the videophone development project, in order to keep both project goals and deadlines coordinated, as both projects depend on each other for success.",
