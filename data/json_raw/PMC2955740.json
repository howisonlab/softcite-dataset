            "text": "Lincomycin-treated pumpkin leaves were illuminated with either continuous light or saturating single-turnover xenon flashes to study the dependence of photoinactivation of photosystem II (PSII) on the mode of delivery of light. The flash energy and the time interval between the flashes were varied between the experiments, and photoinactivation was measured with oxygen evolution and the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (F v /F m). The photoinhibitory efficiency of saturating xenon flashes was found to be directly proportional to flash energy and independent of the time interval between the flashes. These findings indicate that a low-light-specific mechanism, based on charge recombination between PSII electron acceptors and the oxygen-evolving complex, is not the main cause of photoinactivation caused by short flashes in vivo. Furthermore, the relationship between the rate constant of photoinactivation and photon flux density was similar for flashes and continuous light when F v /F m was used to quantify photoinactivation, suggesting that continuous-light photoinactivation has a mechanism in which the quantum yield does not depend on the mode of delivery of light. A similar quantum yield of photoinhibition for flashes and continuous light is compatible with the manganese-based photoinhibition mechanism and with mechanisms in which singlet oxygen, produced via a direct photosensitization reaction, is the agent of damage. However, the classical acceptor-side and donor-side mechanisms do not predict a similar quantum yield for flashes and continuous light.",

            "text": "Light is needed for photosynthesis, but light also damages the photosynthetic machinery. Light-induced inhibition of the activity of photosystem II (PSII) has been termed photoinhibition (for reviews, see Aro et al., 1993;Melis, 1999;Tyystj\u00e4rvi, 2008;Vass and Aro, 2008). A characteristic feature of photoinhibition is that degradation and de novo synthesis of the D1 protein are needed for restoration of the activity of PSII. All light intensities cause inactivation of PSII with a rate constant directly proportional to the light intensity (Tyystj\u00e4rvi and Aro, 1996), and therefore plants need to repair the inactive PSII units continuously. The rate of inactivation of PSII can be measured by illuminating leaves in the presence of an inhibitor such as lincomycin that prevents the concurrent synthesis of the D1 protein.",

Simulations imply that double reduction would not occur under low light (Tyystj\u00e4rvi et al., 2005) or during illumination with single-turnover flashes. However, if Q A remains reduced from flash to flash, then double reduction might occur even during illumination with single-turnover flashes. It has also been suggested that photoinactivation is caused by chlorophyll (Chl) triplets produced in the presence of unstabilized Q A - (Vass and Aro, 2008). In the 'statistical' donor-side hypothesis (Anderson et al., 1998), PSII is inactivated when the oxygen-evolving complex is occasionally unable to donate an electron, that is a miss occurs in the oxygen-evolving complex (Kok, 1970;Antal et al., 2009). After a miss, the oxidized primary donor P 680 + lives for 100-200 ls and then recombines with Q A - (Renger and Wolff, 1976;Renger and Holzwarth, 2005) or damages PSII by oxidizing an inappropriate target. Saturating single-turnover flashes would saturate the formation of long-lived P 680 + , and therefore donor-side photoinhibition would be saturated at the same flash energy that saturates PSII electron transfer.",

According to this hypothesis, generation of the triplet excited state of the primary donor ( 3 P 680 *) by recombination reactions (e.g. S 2 Q B -/S 1 Q B ) triggers the inactivation of PSII. The hypothesis is supported by the finding that nanosecond laser pulses fired with long dark intervals are more photoinhibitory than pulses fired with short intervals (Keren et al., 1997(Keren et al., , 2000. This flash interval dependence has been explained by the fact that the flash yield of charge recombination increases with the length of the dark interval between the flashes. The low-light hypothesis is also supported by data showing that in the green alga Chlamydomonas, less degradation of the D1 protein per flash is caused by pairs of microsecond xenon flashes than by single flashes (Keren et al., 1995). In vitro experiments of inactivation of PSII with xenon flashes have produced contrasting results. The measurements of Szilard et al. (2005) suggest that the photoinhibitory efficiency of xenon flashes depends on the length of the interval between flashes, but the data of Hakala et al. (2005) did not show any flash interval dependence. The low-light hypothesis predicts that flash-induced inactivation of PSII becomes saturated at the same flash energy that saturates PSII electron transport.",

In the photoinhibition experiments, flash energies above the saturation of PSII electron transfer were used. Such flashes cause one turnover of PSII irrespective of the flash energy. To ensure saturation, the flash energy response of PSII oxygen evolution was measured. In these measurements, the lamp to leaf distance was five times longer than in the photoinhibition set-up, and therefore the flash energy response of oxygen evolution provides an upper limit for the flash energy required to saturate PSII The average PPFD of each flash treatment of lincomycin-treated pumpkin leaves was determined as previously described (Hakala et al., 2005). The flash treatments were done with 1800 flashes by varying the flash energy, the time interval between the flashes, and the duration of the experiment, as indicated. electron transport in the photoinhibition set-up. The results indicate that saturation of oxygen evolution of intact leaves occurred at 0.7-0.9 J (Fig. 1). Pumpkin leaves contain ;600 lmol Chl m \u00c02 , and therefore the maximum rate of oxygen evolution (1.2 lmol O 2 per four flashes) corresponded to 88% of reaction centres, assuming one PSII per 440 Chl molecules. Separate fluorescence measurements showed that PSII reaction centres remain open between the flashes when pumpkin leaves are flashed at 10-30 fps as in the flash energy response measurements (Supplementary  Table S1 available at JXB online). For comparison of flashes and continuous light, average PPFD values for flash treatments were calculated, using the known relationship between the flash energy and flash photon content of this lamp (Hakala et al., 2005). In the original flash photon content measurements, the number of visible-light photons per flash was first measured at a narrow wavelength range (475-610 nm) by illuminating meso-diphenylhelianthrene, a chemical actinometer substance (Brauer et al., 1983), and the flash photon content in the 400-700 nm range was obtained by correcting these data with the emission spectrum of the flash lamp (Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). Average PPFD values, used to compare flashes with continuous light, were obtained by dividing the flash photon content by the target area and multiplying by the number of flashes in unit time.",

Measurements of NPQ at the end of the illumination showed a linear increase of NPQ with PPFD of continuous light (Fig. 2). Illumination with xenon flashes at 1 fps at the same PPFD range caused much less NPQ than continuous light, and flashes of 9.3 J and 13.5 J caused the same NPQ response (Fig. 2). Flashes fired at 90 s intervals did not cause NPQ, and the NPQ response caused by flashes fired at 9 s intervals was not statistically significant (data not shown).

The single-turnover nature of the flashes was ensured by showing that flashing does not cause accumulation of reduced Q A (Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online) and that flashing causes very little NPQ even at the highest flash rate of 1 fps (Fig. 2). Measurements of both oxygen evolution and F v /F m show that the photoinhibitory efficiency of single-turnover flashes is di-rectly proportional to flash energy (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the fluorescence data showed that the photoinhibitory efficiency of photons of single-turnover flashes is similar to the photoinhibitory efficiency of photons of continuous light (Fig. 5). Direct proportionality between light intensity and k PI is a key feature of continuous-light photoinhibition (Jones and Kok, 1966;Park et al., 1995;Tyystj\u00e4rvi and Aro, 1996;Allakhverdiev and Murata, 2004). Thus, the finding that the same proportionality constant applies to photoinhibition under flashing light and under continuous light (Fig. 5) suggests that the mechanism of photoinactivation is the same in both conditions.",

Flash-induced and continuous-light-induced photoinactivation had the same quantum yield in F v /F m measurements (Fig. 5A), but flashes were more efficient at causing photoinhibition of oxygen evolution (Figs 3, 5). This finding can be explained by assuming that the photoinhibitory efficiency of flashes and continuous light is similar but chloroplasts of deep cell layers are more efficiently illuminated by flashes than by continuous light. The chloroplast avoidance response (Wada et al., 2003) would not protect the top layer of chloroplasts, and the finding that flashes cause very little chloroplast movements may partially explain why the flashes penetrate better in the leaf. The chloroplast avoidance response affects mostly transmission of blue light (Fig. 7), which is the most effective visible-light wavelength range in photoinhibition in vivo (Sarvikas et al., 2006). Chloroplast movements have little effect on leaf reflectance (Park et al., 1996) and therefore transmission measurements estimate changes in leaf absorptance.",
