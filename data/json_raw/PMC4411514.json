            "text": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common causative agent of genital ulceration and can lead to subsequent neurological disease in some cases. Here, using a genital infection model, we tested the efficacy of vinegar-processed flos of Daphne genkwa (vp-genkwa) to modulate vaginal inflammation caused by HSV-1 infection. Our data revealed that treatment with optimal doses of vp-genkwa after, but not before, HSV-1 infection provided enhanced resistance against HSV-1 infection, as corroborated by reduced mortality and clinical signs. Consistent with these results, treatment with vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection reduced viral replication in the vaginal tract. Furthermore, somewhat intriguingly, treatment of vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection increased the frequency and absolute number of CD3 \u2212 NK1.1 \uff0b NKp46 \uff0b natural killer (NK) cells producing interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and granyzme B, which indicates that vp-genkwa treatment induces the activation of NK cells. Supportively, secreted IFN-\u03b3 was detected at an increased level in vaginal lavages of mice treated with vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection. These results indicate that enhanced resistance to HSV-1 infection by treatment with vp-genkwa is associated with NK cell activation. Therefore, our data provide a valuable insight into the use of vp-genkwa to control clinical severity in HSV infection through NK cell activation.",

            "text": "Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are members of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily within the Herpesviridae family. There are typically two serotypes of HSV: HSV type 1 (HSV-1), which is more frequently found in the oral mucosal and ocular areas and HSV type 2 (HSV-2), which is most commonly encountered as the causative agent of genital infection (1). However, confused infection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 are currently detected due to disorganized habits (2,3). Thus, both HSV-1 and 2 have been regarded as the most common cause of genital ulceration in humans worldwide (4,5). Moreover, HSV infection via the genital route results in the establishment of a lifelong latent infection, which subsequently provides potential transmission to neighbor hosts in response to reactivation (6). In addition, increased acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been reported in HSV-infected individuals (7)(8)(9). Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective therapeutic strategies for HSV-infected patients.",

            "text": "Because the virus is prevalent in the human population, the development of therapeutic strategies rests on an understanding of how each component of the innate and adaptive immune systems responds to HSV infection. Using multiple animal models, the role of innate and adaptive immune cells has been defined. It is believed that HSV replication is initially limited to the epithelium of the mucosa (10,11), and subsequently spreads into the central nervous system (CNS) upon retrograde transport of virions into the sacral ganglia, resulting in a fatal paralysis (11). The majority of research demonstrates that innate immune responses, including natural killer (NK) and NKT cells as well as monocytes, play an important role in conferring protective immunity against genital HSV infection (11,12). Moreover, effectively generated CD4 \uff0b Th1 immunity is essentially required for protection against primary or secondary HSV infection via the mucosal route (13)(14)(15). Therefore, orchestrated infiltration of effector innate and adaptive immune cells, such as NK and T cells, in mucosal tissues appears to be essential for effective protection against HSV infection. In addition, soluble factors, such as type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2), IL-12, and IL-18, produced from innate and adaptive immune cells reportedly play a crucial role in conferring protection against HSV infection (16)(17)(18). Specifically, NK cells are critical for HSV control owing to their direct or indirect mechanisms of recognizing and killing infected cells through the secretion of granzyme B, perforin, or the antiviral cytokines interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (4,5). The activity of antiviral NK cells is regulated by endogenous cytokines, such as type I IFNs and IL-2 (19)(20)(21), and exogenous materials including synthesized and natural compounds (22,23).",

The experiments presented here were undertaken to determine whether vinegar-processed flos of D. genkwa (vp-genkwa) regulate the mortality and clinical signs associated with mucosal HSV-1 infection.

The vinegar-processed Genkwa Flos (vp-genkwa) was produced, as described elsewhere (29). Briefly, the dried and powdered Genkwa Flos was equally mixed with 4% vinegar diluted in H2O (v/v), placed in a moist closed container for one night, transferred to a drug-parching machine to dry at 180 o C, and removed promptly thereafter (30). The dried powder (3 kg) was extracted twice with 3 volumes of room-temperature ethanol. The extract (199 g) was evaporated, freeze dried, and stored at 4 o C before use. The analysis of the vp-genkwa components was performed by UPLC-QTOF-MS chromatogram. Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis was performed using an ACQUITY UPLCTM system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a binary solvent delivery manager and photodiode array (PDA).

Our results revealed that pre-treatment of vp-genkwa had no effect on mortality and clinical signs, compared to the group treated with vehicle ( Fig. 1A and B). However, somewhat intriguingly, mice that were treated with vp-genkwa (10 mpk) after HSV-1 infection showed enhanced resistance (p=0.0605), as well as alleviated clinical signs, compared to mice that received vehicle (Fig.  1C and D). Furthermore, higher doses of vp-genkwa (50 mpk) did not provide increased protection against mucosal HSV-1 infection, indicating that enhanced protective immunity against HSV-1 infection may be achieved with treatment of vp-genkwa at optimal doses after infection. Therefore, these results suggest that treatment of vp-genkwa at an optimal dose after HSV-1 infection provides enhanced protection, while pre-treatment of vp-genkwa before HSV-1 infection does not affect the associated mortality and clinical signs.",

Further, the reduction in viral secretion in vaginal lavages of mice treated with vp-genkwa after infection supported the observed decrease in the clinical signs caused by mucosal HSV-1 infection. Interestingly, the reduction in mortality and clinical signs in mice treated with vp-genkwa after viral infection was closely associated with enhanced NK cell activation, which indicates the involvement  of NK cell activation in vp-genkwa efficacy in the HSV-1 infection model.

            "text": "NK cells are innate immune cells effective against different kinds of viruses, including influenza virus, HSV, and hepatitis B virus, thereby indicating a general role of these cells in potent antiviral immune responses (32,33). The complex function of NK cells is achieved by the production of several immunomodulatory cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, as an indirect mechanism, and the direct killing of virus-infected cells through secretion of granzyme B and perforin in cell-to-cell contact (32,33). Specifically, the induction of IFN\u03b3 is an important feature of activated NK cells because IFN\u03b3 plays a crucial role in various immunological processes such as the generation of CD4 \uff0b Th1 cells (34). There have been various attempts to activate NK cells using immunomodulatory molecules derived from endogenous bioactive molecules, such as interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-15 (19)(20)(21). In addition, several materials derived from chemically synthesized or natural resources were found to be effective forms of drug therapy for chronic diseases, such as cancer and viral infections, through NK cell activation (22,23). Although the molecular networks through which NK cells are activated by vp-genkwa are not clear, our data is strengthened by recent findings that genkwadaphnin, derived from the flower buds of D. genkwa, induces IFN-\u03b3 production from NK cells through activation of protein kinase D (PKD), a member of the PKC family (35). However, our data does not exclude the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) molecules in NK cell activation because NK cells express several TLR molecules on cell and endosomal membranes (36,37). It is assumed that some components derived from vp-genkwa could trigger the activation of TLRs, thereby inducing phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and subsequently nuclear factor (NF)-\u03ba B activation. Therefore, we are currently investigating the role of TLR and downstream molecular networks in the induction of NK cell activation using TLR-and MyD88-deficient mice. However, one incongruous finding is that higher doses of vp-genkwa administered after HSV-1 infection do not increase resistance. It was presumed that excessive triggering of TLR and other innate immune receptors on NK cells could result in a form of innate immunity paralysis characterized by reduced pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine release and hypo-activation of NK cells (38).",
