            "text": "Transthoracic esophagectomy (TTE) is believed to have advantages for mediastinal lymphadenectomy in the treatment of resectable esophageal cancer despite its association with a greater incidence of pulmonary complications and postoperative mortality. Transhiatal esophagectomy is regarded as less invasive, though insufficient in terms of lymph node dissection. With the aim of achieving lymph dissection equivalent to that of TTE, we have developed a nontransthoracic esophagectomy (NTTE) procedure combining a video-assisted cervical approach for the upper mediastinum and a robot-assisted transhiatal approach for the middle and lower mediastinum. We prospectively studied 22 accumulated cases of NTTE and verified feasibility by analyzing perioperative and histopathological outcomes. We compared this group's short-term outcomes with outcomes of 139 equivalent esophageal cancer cases operated on at our institution by conventional TTE (TTE group). In the NTTE group, there were no procedure-related events and no midway conversions to the conventional surgery; the mean operation time was longer (median, 524 vs. 428 minutes); estimated blood loss did not differ significantly between the two groups (median, 385 mL vs. 490 mL); in the NTTE group, the postoperative hospital stay was shorter (median, 18 days vs. 24 days). No postoperative pneumonia occurred in the NTTE group. The frequencies of other major postoperative complications did not differ significantly, nor were there differences in the numbers of harvested mediastinal lymph nodes (median, 30 vs. 29) or in other histopathology findings. NTTE offers a new radical procedure for resection of esophageal cancer combining a cervical video-assisted approach and a transhiatal robotic approach. Although further accumulation of surgical cases is needed to corroborate these results, NTTE promises better prevention of pulmonary complications in the management of esophageal cancer.",

            "text": "Whether a transthoracic or a transhiatal approach is better in esophageal cancer surgery is debated. Transthoracic esophagectomy (TTE) offers sufficient mediastinal lymph node (LN) clearance but is associated with such thoracotomy-related adverse events as postoperative pneumonia and empyema. [1][2][3][4][5] Transhiatal esophagectomy reduces these complications and operative mortality, 6 but compromises mediastinal LN dissection due to poorer access to the mediastinal surgical field. 7,8 Recently, Kutup et al. asked whether the benefits of transthoracic media-stinal lymphadenectomy outweighed the increased operative morbidity; their study concluded that TTE was beneficial for cT3, pT3, and node-positive patients. 9 Another large international study has also shown that the number of dissected LNs was an independent predictor of survival after esophagectomy for cancer. 10 Whether or not the benefits of TTE are disputable, the transthoracic approach to extended mediastinal dissection is indisputably more likely to achieve extended LN dissection.",

            "text": "Access to the mediastinal field via a transhiatal approach has been improved, however, by both robot-assisted and video-assisted surgery. Robotassisted surgery is now widely used; its utility is most apparent in such narrow operative fields as the pelvic cavity or the mediastinum, where conventional laparoscopic or thoracoscopic manipulations are subject to severe restrictions. Robot-assisted transhiatal esophagectomy is reportedly feasible for transhiatal mediastinal LN dissection. 11,12 Video-assisted transcervical dissection of the upper mediastinal LNs, which are distant from the hiatus, is another example of a nontransthoracic approach. 13,14 The combination of transhiatal robotic manipulation and a video-assisted transcervical procedure makes nontransthoracic esophagectomy (NTTE) potentially as radical as and equivalent to TTE. We have developed this combined surgery technique with the aim of achieving mediastinal lymphadenectomy outcomes equivalent to those of TTE, and to establish its feasibility, we conducted a study of this NTTE for the first time in a prospective cohort of patients. Here, we demonstrate the short-term outcomes of this NTTE.",

Twenty patients were extubated in the operating room; two patients were not immediately extubated because of delayed recovery from general anesthesia or vocal cord paralysis.

In the TTE group, 23 patients underwent cervical anastomosis and 116 patients intrathoracic anastomosis. Fifteen among the 23 underwent the same retromediastinal gastric conduit reconstruction as the NTTE group; the remaining eight underwent either subcutaneous or retrosternal reconstruction. Four (27%) of the 15 patients who underwent retromediastinal gastric conduit reconstruction developed an anastomotic leakage, compared with only five (4.3%) of the 116 patients who underwent intrathoracic anastomosis.

            "text": "In the history of esophageal cancer treatment, achieving an optimal balance between radicality on the one hand and reduction of postoperative pulmonary complications with quality of life improvement on the other has presented a dilemma that we sought to overcome by developing NTTE. In this study, an equivalent number of LNs were retrieved from each level of the mediastinal lymph stations in comparison with the historical control group, although survival analyses of the long-term outcomes will be needed to confirm oncological equivalence. The number of retrieved mediastinal nodes by NTTE was comparable to the numbers reported (from 23 to 33) in literature on TTE. [18][19][20][21] In our series of patients, no reduction was observed in the operation time or in the blood loss. Prolongation of operation time has been reported in robotic surgeries and, together with high running costs, is considered a disadvantage of the robotic approach. 22,23 However, no postoperative respiratory complications have been observed in the current series of patients, and there were no severe postoperative events requiring intensive care. In addition, the median hospital stay of 18 days was shorter than the median length reported in Japan (22 to 35 days). [24][25][26] Although these advantages may reflect the small proportion of advanced disease in the NTTE group, the extent of lymph dissection was clearly not compromised in the NTTE group, given that LN retrievals were virtually identical (30 [NTTE] vs. 29 [TTE]) in both groups. If these findings are replicated with a larger population of patients, the low incidence of pulmonary complications and shorter hospital stays observed in the NTTE group in this study will outweigh the disadvantages (prolongation of operation time, cost, etc.) of using the robotic device. The length of hospital stay is longer in Japanese studies reflecting differences between Japanese and Western cultures and medical systems. Therefore, the advantages of the shorter hospital stays found in this Japanese study might not be universally generalizable and will require verification in Western settings. Another potential discrepancy stems from differences in body mass index (BMI): the participants in this study were all Japanese, whose median BMI is approximately 22.5. The perioperative data, such as estimated blood loss or operation time, and the complication rate should be re-validated with Western patients to better establish NTTE's feasibility.",

However, with better understanding of the mediastinal structures viewed transhiatally, the blood loss was decreased (to median 260 mL) in the 10 most recent cases (data not shown). The increased anastomotic leakage might be attributable to the cervical anastomosis, as the anastomotic site is, on average, more distant from the feeding vessels of the gastric conduit, as reported in previous studies comparing transhiatal esophagectomy and TTE. 27,28 In our current study, the anastomotic leakage was highest among the subgroup of TTE patients who underwent cervical anastomosis. Leakage of intrathoracic anastomosis often results in empyema with occasionally life-threatening consequences, but did not in our series of patients, in whom none of these anastomotic failures led to lethal complications or required surgical interventions.",

Meanwhile, in our current study, the occurrence of postoperative pneumonia was decreased in the NTTE group with a statistically marginal difference (0% in NTTE vs. 14% in TTE). Although our current findings did not attain statistical significance due to the small number of cases, they nonetheless showed that the nontransthoracic approach is feasible and may help to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications.
