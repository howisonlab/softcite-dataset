This study explores the efficacy of re-instruction and illustrates a comprehensive version of the Silverman integrated approach (C-SIA), based on the integration of static and dynamic pain scores, morphine consumption, and the ratio between demanded and delivered PCA boluses (the DD ratio). Methods: In total, 50 patients operated on for colorectal surgery were studied retrospectively. The change in DD ratio after re-instruction was analyzed as the primary endpoint. Re-instructed and not re-instructed subjects were compared according to DD ratio, pain scores, and morphine consumption. A secondary comparison was performed using the SIA and C-SIA scores, to illustrate the reliability of the latter tool. Agreement between C-SIA and SIA score was assessed using a Bland-Altman analysis. Results: In re-instructed patients, the DD ratio decreased after re-education (P = 0.011). Re-instructed patients had higher DD ratios (P = 0.018) and pain scores at rest (P = 0.024) and movement (P = 0.012) at 24 h after surgery than not re-instructed subjects. These differences disappeared at the 48 h visit. Both the SIA and C-SIA scores reflected these findings. C-SIA scores showed a higher coefficient of correlation with the DD ratio (r = 0.815; P < 0.001) than SIA scores (r = 0.663; P < 0.001). The C-SIA scores, in absolute values, being based on more variables, were, on average, 2.5 times the SIA score. Conclusions: Re-instruction is effective for optimizing PCA therapy. The C-SIA is an alternative to the SIA score that gives an overall measure of PCA therapy efficacy.",

In fact, during that period, the acute pain service was made up of dedicated staff nurse and senior residents. Only complete data for opioidna\u00efve adult patients treated with morphine iv PCA for at least 2 days were collected. Patients treated with methadone PCA or epidural analgesia or transferred to the intensive care unit postoperatively were not included. The DD ratio, pain scores at rest and movement (verbal numerical scale, VNS, an 11-point scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = insufferable pain), and morphine daily consumption at 24 and 48 h after surgery were reviewed. Data were retrieved from the electronic acute pain service database and collected in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Patients were grouped according to whether they needed re-instruction on the correct use of the PCA pump device at the 24 h visit. Physicians in the acute pain service provided re-instruction according to their own clinical evaluation of subjects at the first postoperative visit (24 h after surgery). Generally, high pain scores (VNS at rest > 3 and movement > 6), low morphine consumption (< 20-30 mg during the first 24 h after surgery) [1,7,9], and DD ratios > 1 indicated patients needing re-instruction.",

Furthermore, to better evaluate the intervention, we compared re-instructed patients with a not re-instructed sample of patients, as a control group. Re-instructed patients showed higher median DD ratios 24 h after the operation than not re-instructed patients (P = 0.018) but this difference was not observed 24 h later (P = 0.154). Similarly, VNS scores at rest and movement were higher in re-instructed patients 24 h after surgery. These data indicate that re-instructed patients failed to self-administer the necessary amount of morphine to achieve adequate pain relief. Furthermore, the median DD ratio of re-instructed patients (1.26) was close to 1.35, the cut-off value previously proposed to re-instruct patients or adjust PCA therapy plans [7].",

In fact, the postoperative visit was based on VNS scores, drug consumption, and DD ratio assessment, but not on the verification of a correct understanding of PCA device use. Seeking to increase the overall assessment of patients for descriptive purposes, we proposed an approach that expands the original SIA score, presenting a comprehensive score, named C-SIA. The C-SIA score, useful for the evaluation of iv PCA therapies, is based on the integration of four main variables: static and dynamic pain scores, morphine consumption, and the DD ratio.

A high C-SIA value means inadequate pain relief, high morphine consumption, and a high DD ratio.

The calculation of this score using common statistical software is simple and its performance is comparable to the SIA score.

The C-SIA score allows the setting of a global end-point (as a composite outcome), based on both pain scores and PCA data.
