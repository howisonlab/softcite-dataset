The combination of periodic elections and widespread diffusion of information ensures that politicians make clear their preferences, do not renege on their promises once in power, and, more broadly, do not abuse their position for private gains. Strong checks and balances increase policy stability, and, ultimately, the protection of property rights, because the existence of several distinct veto players hinders any changes in the status quo. When policy changes do occur, institutionalized channels of influence/ lobbying can allow foreign investors to mitigate any adverse effects. Consolidated democracies also guarantee orderly and non-violent changes of government within the current institutional framework.",

Politicians' desire to win elections may lead them to promise and adopt popular but economically harmful policies. Political turnover creates uncertainty about the persistence of policies, whereas an increase in the number of veto players has the potential to result in long-term reform sclerosis. Foreign firms may suffer from a political liability of foreignness and be discriminated against relative to their better politically-connected domestic competitors. Finally, a related but more sinister view is that freedom of expression and open media can prevent foreign firms from colluding with officials in order to obtain generous entry deals or to decrease market competition. Hence, FDI may be attracted by autocracies.",

Some researchers have attempted to deal with these atypical observations (Jakobsen and De Soysa, 2006;Choi, 2009;Li, 2009). However, it is unlikely that they have solved this issue in a satisfactory manner. Popular robust estimators (e.g. median regression estimator or M-estimator) are sensitive to outliers present in the values of explanatory variables and outlier diagnostics (e.g. the Cook distance) frequently fail to detect atypical observations as they fundamentally rely on the extremely non-robust-to-outliers least-squares estimator (Verardi and Croux, 2009). Problems of inadequate econometric identification and treatment of outliers thus remain pervasive in the FDI literature.",

An aggravating problem is that the most resistant robust regression methods are ill-designed to analyse econometric models, which include a large number of dummies. While some robust panel data estimators have been proposed, they appear not to be consistent when the number of time periods is small, and cannot deal with dummies not related to the within transformation (Aquaro and Pavel, 2010).",

We pay particular attention to the multi-faceted nature of democracy, the influence of outliers, and the heterogeneous relationship that may exist between these two variables. We use a variety of measures to explore how each particular dimension of democracy can influence FDI. We develop a new robust dummy estimator, which allows us to control for outliers in a fixed effects panel data model. Finally, we investigate whether the impact of democracy on FDI depends on natural resources, income inequality, and their interaction. Our results show that democracy generally has a positive impact on FDI, once outliers are controlled for, but that this relationship is very specific to each host country's characteristics.",

This algorithm, however, leads to a great number of replications and, therefore, becomes excessively slow (and unapplicable) when data sets are large. Hubert and Rousseeuw (1997) suggest using a multivariate outlier detection tool to identify leverage points (i.e. outliers in the x-dimension), which they then apply a weight zero to, and subsequently, to use an estimator that withstands contamination on the vertical dimension (such as median regression), but that does not need to be robust against leverage points (because these have already been removed).

            "text": "Finally, Maronna and Yohai (2000) propose two estimators. First is the M-GM estimator, which is similar to that of Hubert and Rousseeuw (1997), but where the influence of dummies in the multivariate setup is tackled by partialling them out. This estimator has a low breakdown point. Second is the M-S estimator, which alternates two estimators: an M-estimator and an S-estimator. Regression monotonic M-estimators are easy to compute and minimize the sum of a less rapidly increasing function of the residuals than the quadratic loss function. The drawback of these estimators is that they can only be used when outliers belong to the dependent variable and there is no outlyingness in the space of the explanatory variables (i.e. when no leverage points are present). This is the case when a continuous variable is regressed on a set of dummy variables. In contrast, S-estimators cope well with leverage points but their practical implementation is often unfeasible when several dummies are present due to the existence of collinear subsamples. The MS algorithm alternates, therefore, between an M-estimator after partialling-out continuous variables and an S-estimator after partialling-out dummy explanatory variables. The partialling-out is done using the estimated parameters obtained in the previous M or S step. A disadvantage of this method is that the algorithm has to be stopped after a set number of iterations, even though there is no guarantee that no better solution would have appeared in further replications. Indeed, as stated by Maronna and Yohai (2000), the scale (the measure of dispersion of the residuals) does not necessarily decrease after each iteration.",

It has been cited 650 times, and, as shown in Figure 3, it remains a key reference today. In this section, we investigate the robustness of this study's findings to outliers. 2 The sample covers 112 countries over the period 1970-1997, the dependent variable is FDI inflows as a share of GDP, and the proxy for democracy is Polity IV score (see Table 5 for a description). We focus on the key regression of the paper: model 10 in Table 4. The estimates suggest that a fully autocratic government (score of 0) becoming fully democratic (score of 20) can be expected to attract 0.4% more FDI flows as a percentage of GDP). Given that the average level of FDI flows in the sample is 1.3% of GDP, this is a sizeable amount. Table 4 presents our results. Column (1) replicates perfectly the estimates found in Jensen (2003). In column (2), we remove the observations identified as outliers by the Cook distance, which is a scaled measure of the distance between the coefficient vectors when a given observation is omitted. Five percent of the observations are deemed to be outliers. Their omission has no qualitative impact on the results. In column (3) we use an M-estimator, which gives a lower weight to observations with large standardized residuals but is not robust to leverage points. The estimated impact of democracy falls by half. In column (4), the M-estimator is used again, but the sample now only includes observations that have not been identified as outliers, and, therefore, potential leverage points, in column (2). This is essentially what the Stata command -rreg-is doing. Results are similar to those in column (4).  Table 4.

However, the estimated effect of democracy on FDI is only 25% of the magnitude of the initial estimate. A fully autocratic government becoming fully democratic can now be expected to attract only 0.1% more FDI flows as a percentage of GDP. It is worth noting than the fit of this regression is much better than that of column (1): the R 2 increases from 0.613 to 0.945. This reflects the fact that a sizeable number of observations (25%) are not well explained by the empirical model. In column (6), the model is estimated using the outlying observations. It can be seen that the vast majority of countries had experienced atypical FDI flows. These episodes are not well predicted by past FDI flows and tend to coincide with changes in economic growth and fiscal stance. In column (7), we use the MS estimator. Results are very close to those in column (5). 3 Figure 4 provides a way of assessing the most outlying countries. Countries are classified as outliers when the value of the mean of the residuals standardized by a robust estimate of their standard deviation is greater than 2.25 (dashed lines). The most outlying countries tend to be small countries, located in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Sub-Saharan Africa. It is often not straightforward to explain why some observations are outliers. However, in the case of Eastern Europe countries, it is easy to interpret their atypical behaviour as the consequence of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and their subsequent adoption of market-based economic systems with mixed results. Figure 5 shows that the Eastern Europe countries in the sample experienced a boom in FDI and rapid democratization after the year 1989, despite deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. These two concomitant trends may explain the positive relationship between FDI and democracy identified in column (1). 3 In the final estimation stage, the M-S estimator uses all (weighted) observations, whereas our robust dummy estimator omits identified outliers. This explains why the reported number of observations is different in columns 5  We investigate this possibility in column (8) where we remove Eastern European countries from the sample (4% of the observations). We now fail to find a statistically significant impact of democracy on FDI. It could be argued that these observations provide valuable information because they could be interpreted as encompassing a 'natural experiment' on the effects of democracy on FDI. Hence, in column (9), we use the full sample but we include interaction terms between the nineties dummy variable and three regional dummy variables (EAS, Eastern Europe; SSA, Sub-Saharan Africa; LAC, Latin America and the Carribean). In that way, we control for common effects in each region that may influence FDI and may also be correlated with democracy. The coefficients on the interaction terms indicate that the EAS and LAC regions have, indeed, attracted, holding other factors constant, much more FDI than other regions in the nineties. Once we control for these regional effects, the coefficient on democracy becomes negative and statistically insignificant, suggesting that democratization occurred at the same time as the improvement of the business environment for foreign investors, but did not have a direct effect on a country's attractiveness. Finally, in column (10), we estimate the model of column (9) using our robust-to-outliers dummy estimator. Relative to column (5), the number of outliers identified is roughly the same but we now fail to find a statistically significant impact of democracy on FDI.",

The outlying observations were not identified by common robust methods and diagnostic tools. Analysis of the outliers suggested the adoption of a more flexible model, which took into account that some regions have experienced dramatic changes in their political and economic conditions. When we did so, controlling for outliers or not, we failed to find a statistically significant positive impact of democracy on FDI. Hence, the findings of Jensen (2003)  seems to stem from model misspecification (a restrictive empirical model) that we were able to identify and mitigate thanks to our robust-to-outliers dummy estimator.",

Schumpeter (1942, p. 250) adopted a minimalist perspective by defining it as 'the institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people's vote'. His vision revolves around the existence of contested elections, which can be interpreted as a disciplining device, but does not involve any reference to the institutional arrangements constraining the abuse of political powers between elections. These constitutional checks and balances are, nevertheless, often judged to be a vital democratic attribute (Munck and Verkuilen, 2002). Media freedom is also perceived as a crucial component of a well-functioning democracy as it guarantees that formal and real accountability overlap. The various proxies that we use in this paper cover these various aspects of democracy. Table 5 provides detailed information on each measure. To facilitate comparison of estimates, we normalize all variables: each proxy of democracy is rescaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. We will test each of these democracies' proxies, using the following fixed effects dynamic panel data model:",

Our measure of FDI is the log of financial FDI stock (liabilities), which have been carefully compiled for a large sample of countries over the period 1970-2006 by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007). Note that unlike the studies reported in Table 1, we use FDI stocks instead of FDI flows. As explained by Egger and Merlo (2007), theoretical models of FDI suggest that this is the appropriate dependent variable; change in the value of a given determinant leads to FDI flows until a new steady-state FDI stock is reached. We wish to keep the sample constant across all regressors. Data for the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) voice and accountability indicator start in 1996, and are only available in even years from 1998 to 2002. We decided, therefore, to work with the same 2-year interval data set, whichever the measure of democracy tested. Overall, our sample covers 111 developing countries and 5 years: 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006. For each country, we have, therefore, a maximum of five observations. This short time dimension of our panel, the presence of a lagged dependent variable and the inclusion of fixed effects, motivate us to keep our empirical  FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND DEMOCRACY model parsimonious. In addition to democracy, we control for four other variables. The lagged dependent variable captures the sluggish adjustment of FDI stocks towards their long-run levels over time (Kinoshita and Mody, 2001). Market size (GDP) is the most accepted determinant of FDI (Chakrabarti, 2001). The combination of GDP and population size allows us to control for the level of development, which can be seen as a catchall proxy for various factors attracting or deterring FDI (e.g. consumers' purchasing power or labour costs; Benassy-Quere et al., 2007;Cheung and Qian, 2009;Lane, 2015). Finally, we include the World Bank governance measure of regulatory quality. This governance dimension has frequently been found to be one of the most statistically significant institutional determinants of FDI (Globerman and Shapiro, 2003;Daude and Stein, 2007) and is well-correlated with the different measures of democracy (r\u22430:60). We do not include other governance variables because we do not want to eliminate the channels of influence through which democratic changes can influence FDI (e.g. a strengthening of property rights protection).",

            "text": "Finally, we assume that other FDI determinants are captured adequately by the fixed effects, including time-invariant country characteristics that may be correlated with democracy. It could be argued that the time-series dimension of our panel is too short to identify the impact of democracy on FDI through the investigation of how changes in FDI are related to changes in democracy. However, Table 6 shows that the within variation of the measures of democracy is relatively high, with values ranging between one-third and half of the between-variation. This relatively high time-series variation indicates that many countries have experienced changes in their political regimes over the period 1998-2006. In more econometric terms, although we do not exploit the between-variation of the data, the within-variation of the data is high enough to allow the relatively precise identification of the parameters of our empirical model. It is well known that the fixed effects estimator for dynamic panel models is biased and inconsistent for fixed T time periods, due to the correlation of the within transformed lagged dependent variable with the within transformed error term (Nickell, 1981). Using instrumental variables methods to obtain consistent estimates would singularly complicate the implementation of our robust-to-outliers dummy estimator and distract us from our main focus. We circumvent this issue by constraining \u03b3 1 = 0.75, which is the value that we obtain when we estimate this coefficient over the 1980-2006 period for our sample of countries, using a robust application (see Desbordes and Verardim 2011) of the Anderson and Hsiao (1981) dynamic panel data estimator. 4",

For each measure of democracy, we provide the classical FE estimates, the robust dummy (R-FE) estimates, and, for comparison, Maronna and Yohai (2000) M-S estimates. Supporters of democracy would find the FE estimates extremely disappointing as no democratic attribute appears to exert a substantial and statistically significant effect on FDI. Furthermore, it is disconcerting to find that GDP, the most robust FDI determinant in the literature, is not statistically significant. In contrast, the R-FE estimates paint a much different and nuanced picture. For most proxies, democracy appears to have a positive and statistically significant impact on FDI. A one standard deviation increase in democracy would increase FDI by approximately 3-10% in the short run. These effects are not negligible because they are equivalent to a 20-40% rise in GDP (holding population constant), which is now also a statistically significant determinant of FDI, along with population. Foreign investors seem to be particularly attracted by countries in which political decisions become more constrained by institutional checks and balances and greater media freedom. Column (8 0 ) of Table 7 shows that a free press trumps other democratic attributes defining a 'liberal democracy', including checks and balances.",

In other words, autocracies and (partially) free media seem compatible. Egorov et al. (2009) suggest that this coexistence results from the need for an autocrat to obtain some independent feedback on the performance of the bureaucracy. In column (9 0 ) of Table 7, the Freedom House (FH) Press Freedom index is decomposed into its three subcategories: (1) legal environment, which assesses 'both and examination of the laws and regulations that could influence media content as well as the government's inclination to use these laws and legal institutions in order to restrict the media's ability to operate'; (2) political environment, which measures 'the degree of political control over the content of news media'; 3) economic environment, which is related to 'the economic considerations that can influence the media's activities' (Freedom House, 2010a, pp. 12-13). Only the last two dimensions appear to be significant FDI determinants. Freille et al. (2007) find a similar outcome when investigating the impact of Table 7. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and democracy Dependent variable:     FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND DEMOCRACY media freedom on corruption. Overall, these results suggest that the key factor that explains why democracies attract more FDI than autocracies is their tendency to exhibit greater media freedom, which presumably restrains bureaucratic corruption and enhances policy transparency. From another perspective, an autocracy can be as successful as a democracy in terms of attracting FDI as long as these two outcomes are met; the success of Singapore immediately comes to mind. The other dimension of public governance, regulatory quality, always exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on FDI, whatever the estimator used, although its influence appears to be smaller when outliers are controlled for. Based on column (6 0 ), a one standard deviation improvement in the quality of regulations would have approximately twice the short-run positive impact as a one standard deviation move towards more media freedom (10%). Amin and Djankov (2009) show that democratic regimes tend to favour pro-business microeconomic reforms. On this basis, it is likely that the direct impact of democracy on FDI that we have estimated represents a lower bound effect because it does not account for the positive impact of democracy via better regulatory quality.",

It can be seen that the R-FE estimator drastically increases the fit of the empirical model, whereas this is not true for the MS-estimator. Hence, the former estimator seems more suitable to explain the typical response of FDI to democratic changes. 5 The presence of few squares and triangles in the left and right panels of Figure 6 shows that very few countries are block concentrated outliers (Bramati and Croux, 2007); that is, for most countries, the volume of FDI that they received was, most of the time, well predicted by the empirical model estimated. For regression (7), the block outliers are Djibouti and Lybia. Interestingly, the FDI performance of the so-called BRICS countries, 6 which accounted for 48% of the change in total FDI liabilities during the sample period, does not appear to have been atypical, despite the fact that some studies have frequently suggested that they are outliers (Choi, 2009). Hence, contrary to some of the worries raised in the political science literature (Li, 2009), the use of robust regression methods does not necessarily imply a drastic loss of coverage of the activities of foreign investors. Large FDI recipients are not necessary outliers, as long as the empirical model is reasonably well specified.",

Their rationale, supported by their empirical analysis is that, in resource-exporting countries, which tend to attract FDI mainly concentrated in extractive industries, foreign investors prefer the stability and easy access to natural resources that an autocracy presumably offers. This is a remarkable finding as it goes against the alleged benefits of democracy outlined in the Introduction and because Guriev et al. (2011) and Jensen and Johnston (2011) have shown that autocracies are more likely to expropriate foreign investors, including in the petroleum, natural gas and mining sectors. Nevertheless, we re-estimate our econometric model, which now includes the proxy of Asiedu and Lien (2011) for natural resource rich countries, the share of fuel and minerals in total merchandise exports, and its interaction with our different measures of democracy. Data on exports come from UNCTAD. 7 Table 8 shows that estimates based on the classical FE estimator would, to a certain extent, support the arguments of Asiedu and Lien (2011). However, once again, the R-FE estimates tell a different story. In most regressions, the coefficient on the interaction term is positive, large, and statistically significant, indicating that the higher a country's natural resource export intensity, the more positive the effect of democracy on FDI. Figure 8 summarizes the relationship between the effect of democracy on FDI and natural resource abundance; the impact of democracy is presented at different deciles of the share of fuel and minerals in total merchandise exports. For high levels of natural resources, whichever the measure of democracy employed, the impact of greater democracy is positive, statistically significant and substantially much larger than in resource-poor countries.",

Hence, stronger checks and balances, which may not only proxy for policy stability but also for the degree of political inclusiveness (Reynal-Querol, 2005), and media freedom, may guarantee that discontent is expressed in non-violent and destructive ways, such as protests (Przeworski et al., 2000;Pal, 2011). From an endogenous perspective, democratization may have been the rational choice of the elites that do not wish to be expropriated when faced with the likelihood of a revolution too costly to repress or to avoid via redistributive policies (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006). Even though democracy and violence are again negatively correlated, it is the threat of the later that has triggered the emergence of the latter.

In a textbook median voter model, greater income inequality leads to more demands for redistribution, resulting in more taxation (Alesina and Perotti, 1994).

In periods of high commodity prices, such as the 1998-2006 period, foreign firms in extractive industries are ideal targets as governments can easily argue that the visible windfall profits of those firms, unrelated to the intrinsic merit of their operative capabilities and generated by the exploitation of territorial resources, ought to be shared in a more balanced way. Furthermore, given the relatively scarcity of natural resources and the extremely high level of sunk costs required to extract, process and distribute them, capital mobility in these industries is low. Foreign firms cannot credibly threaten to move their operations abroad in response to an increase in taxation or the formulation of adverse policies. Hence, while democracy may reduce the risk of conflict, it may also increase regulatory uncertainty. We investigate this possibility by including in our model the Gini index of net income inequality and its interactions with democracy, natural resource export intensity and both. Data on the Gini coefficient come from Solt (2009).

A comparison of the classical and robust FE estimates shows again that results tend to be very different once the influence of outliers is controlled for. Focusing on the R-FE estimates, the impact of democracy on FDI is now less clear-cut than before as it is the product of the proxy used, natural resource export intensity and income inequality. As hypothesized, when a country's natural resource export intensity is high, the positive impact of democracy is weaker when income inequality is high. Foreign investors in the oil or mining industries presumably discount the benefits of more democracy by the probability of being confronted, now or once the investment has been 'sunk', with higher taxation or more stringent regulations. For some measures, when a country's natural resource export intensity is low, democracy exerts its strongest positive impact on FDI when income inequality is high. Assuming that FDI in extractive industries is relatively low, this effect can be interpreted as the belief that democratic progress, in addition to all the previously mentioned benefits, will favour socio-political stability, while high capital mobility ought to deter greater taxation of foreign firms.",

This result shows again that the impact of a given democratic attribute on FDI is context-specific.

The empirical models estimated by R-FE fit much better the data than those estimated by the M-S estimator; the average R 2 is 0.99 with the former and 0.82 (0.87) for Figure 10 with the latter, worse than the R 2 obtained with the standard fixed effects estimator.

            "text": "The contributions of this paper have been twofold. First, we developed a new robust-to-outliers dummy estimator, which ought to be extremely useful to applied economists, given the increasing preference for panel data fixed effects models in economics. Second, we used this estimator to investigate the recent impact of democracy on FDI. We show that once outliers are controlled for, democratic attributes tend to attract FDI, especially when they are associated with stronger checks and balances, greater inclusiveness or media freedom. Furthermore, we find that the positive effects of democracy are even larger when FDI is concentrated in natural resources. A plausible explanation is that democracy reduces the occurrence of violent conflicts, which are a major deterrent for FDI in extractive industries characterized by large sunk costs. Finally, we put forward the case that other factors, such as income inequality, also play a mediating role in the relationship between FDI and democracy. Even though democracy may reduce social and political unrest in highly unequal societies, it may also trigger damaging redistributive policies for FDI in resource-abundant countries. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the impact of democracy on FDI is extremely complex and difficult to measure as it depends on the democratic attribute considered, the host country's characteristics and the estimator used. counterparts, this estimator will become resistant to outliers. Hence, we propose to use the Stahel-Donoho estimate (see Maronna and Yohai, 2000) to identify and remove multivariate outliers in the set M = (y, X) = (y, X 1 , X 2 ) and obtain robust \u2211 XX and\u2211 Xy : Once we have preliminary estimates for parameters \u03b8 and residuals r i , we can use an iterative algorithm to find a solution to equation 3.",
