Iron is an essential nutrient for Trichomonas and plays a pivotal role in the establishment of infection, proliferation, and virulence. To gain insight into the role of iron in T. vaginalis gene expression and genome evolution, we screened iron-regulated genes using an oligonucleotide microarray for T. vaginalis and by comparative EST (expressed sequence tag) sequencing of cDNA libraries derived from trichomonads cultivated under iron-rich (+Fe) and iron-restricted (\u00c0Fe) conditions. Among 19,000 ESTs from both libraries, we identified 336 iron-regulated genes, of which 165 were upregulated under +Fe conditions and 171 under \u00c0Fe conditions. The microarray analysis revealed that 195 of 4,950 unique genes were differentially expressed. Of these, 117 genes were upregulated under +Fe conditions and 78 were upregulated under \u00c0Fe conditions. The results of both methods were congruent concerning the regulatory trends and the representation of gene categories. Under +Fe conditions, the expression of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in the energy metabolism of hydrogenosomes, and in methionine catabolism was increased. The iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery and certain cysteine proteases are of particular importance among the proteins upregulated under \u00c0Fe conditions. A unique feature of the T. vaginalis genome is the retention during evolution of multiple paralogous copies for a majority of all genes. Although the origins and reasons for this gene expansion remain unclear, the retention of multiple gene copies could provide an opportunity to evolve differential expression during growth in variable environmental conditions. For genes whose expression was affected by iron, we found that iron influenced the expression of only some of the paralogous copies, whereas the expression of the other paralogs was iron independent. This finding indicates a very stringent regulation of the differentially expressed paralogous genes in response to changes in the availability of exogenous nutrients and provides insight into the evolutionary rationale underlying massive paralog retention in the Trichomonas genome."

            "text": "Gene duplications are important in evolution (Lynch and Conery 2000), and no genome has more recently duplicated genes than the parasitic flagellate Trichomonas vaginalis, the causative agent of trichomoniasis (Carlton et al. 2007;Cui et al. 2010). Trichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted infection of nonviral origin in humans. Although trichomoniasis is usually self-limiting in males, it causes serious health problems for female patients, including an increased risk of cervical cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and transmission of the HIV (Laga et al. 1993;Zhang and Begg 1994;Viikki et al. 2000;Moodley et al. 2002). Trichomoniasis during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight, the premature rupture of membranes and preterm birth (Cotch et al. 1997). The establishment of a T. vaginalis infection as well as infections by other pathogenic microorganisms is dependent on the efficient acquisition of essential nutrients such as iron, from the host environment. Trichomonads can utilize various host iron-containing proteins such as lactoferrin, transferrin, ferritin, hemoglobin, and low-molecularweight-iron complexes (Sutak et al. 2008). Iron is required for critical housekeeping functions such as proteosynthesis, genome duplication, and energy fixation. A significant portion of the trichomonad energy metabolism takes place in hydrogenosomes, whose function is particularly dependent on iron (Gorrell 1985;Van\u00e1 cov\u00e1 et al. 2001). These specific mitochondria-related organelles contain a number of FeS proteins that catalyze key steps in ferredoxin-linked electron transport, hydrogen production, and ATP synthesis at the level of substrate phosphorylation (Hrdy et al. 2004). The formation of FeS clusters in the catalytic centers of apoproteins is mediated by the hydrogenosomal iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery, which consists of approximately 10 proteins, of which cysteine desulfurase (IscS) and the molecular scaffold protein IscU are the main components (Tachezy et al. 2001;Sutak, Dolezal, et al. 2004. Iron is also required for the functions of cytosolic and nuclear FeS proteins such as Rli1p, which is a protein essential for ribosome biogenesis and function (Kispal et al. 2005;Yarunin et al. 2005). This protein is highly conserved in eukaryotes, including T. vaginalis (Sm\u00edd et al. 2008).",

            "text": "In addition to housekeeping functions, iron affects specific host-pathogen interactions associated with the virulence of the parasite. Experiments performed in vitro have shown that iron regulates the cytoadherence of T. vaginalis to target cells (Mundodi et al. 2006) as well as the expression of cysteine proteinases (Sommer et al. 2005;Solano-Gonz\u00e1 lez et al. 2007;Kummer et al. 2008), ecto-ATPases and ecto-phosphatases (De Jesus et al. 2006), and it increases trichomonad resistance to complement-mediated lysis (Alderete et al. 1995). Iron-dependent enhancement of experimental infections in mice was demonstrated with the related bovine parasite Tritrichomonas foetus (Kulda et al. 1999). However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the iron-dependent regulation of these processes. Positive iron regulation at the transcriptional level was observed for the expression of some hydrogenosomal proteins, including malic enzyme (ME) and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) (Van\u00e1 cov\u00e1 et al. 2001). A detailed study of the iron-dependent regulation of hydrogenosomal ME, which may alternatively be present on the cell surface as the adhesin (AP65-1) (Hirt et al. 2007), led to the identification of Myb recognition elements and novel Myb proteins that appear to be components of a multifarious regulatory machinery in T. vaginalis (Ong et al. 2006(Ong et al. , 2007. Two cysteine proteases, TVCP4 and TVCP12, were recently reported to be regulated at the posttranscriptional level by an iron-responsive element/iron response protein-like system (Solano-Gonz\u00e1 lez et al. 2007;Torres-Romero and Arroyo 2009).",

To estimate timeframe for cultivation prior to RNA isolation, we monitored enzymatic activities of PFOR and ME (Rasoloson et al. 2002) as their expression is known to be affected by iron availability in trichomonads (Van\u00e1 cov\u00e1 et al. 2001). The activities of both enzymes decreased during 24 h cultivation under \u00c0Fe conditions and then remained stable (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). Thus, to assure ultimate effect of iron on trichomonads, we cultivated the cells for 5 days under +Fe/\u00c0Fe conditions prior to each experiment. The total RNA was then isolated from both treatment groups and hybridized onto DNA microarray slides containing PCR products amplified from 7,688 EST clones representing 4,950 unique T. vaginalis genes. A direct pairwise comparison strategy was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Altogether, 10 independent hybridizations were performed using samples from four independent experiments.

The relative frequency (RF) of an EST was calculated as the number of ESTs per 10,000 clones.

The distribution of unique genes to upregulation index categories is summarized in supplementary table S2d, Supplementary Material online. The upregulation index values ranged from 1 to 70, which was considerably higher than the range of the fold change based on microarray analysis. Consequently we used higher cut-off limit: a gene was considered to be significantly upregulated if the upregulation index was greater than or equal to five. This criterion met 336 genes ($5%) out of a total number of 6,381 unique genes that were generated by the assembly of the ESTs. Of those genes, 165 were upregulated under +Fe conditions, and 171 were upregulated under \u00c0Fe conditions (supplementary table S2c, Supplementary Material online).

At least one (but usually several) of multiple gene copies encoding glycolytic proteins showed significant iron-dependent regulation ( fig. 3 and supplementary  table S3, Supplementary Material online), with similar results obtained from both methods (microarray and EST analysis). The enzymes that supply the glycolytic pathway with substrates (glucokinase, glycogen phosphorylase, and phosphoglucomutase) and the successive glycolytic enzymes were significantly upregulated under +Fe conditions. A striking exception was the upregulation of one of the four detected glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes (TVAG_366380) under \u00c0Fe conditions according to the EST analysis, as the other three GAPDH genes were upregulated under +Fe conditions ( fig. 3 and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). It is tempting to speculate that GAPDH TVAG_366380 gene copy encodes protein with the function distinct from other paralogs. Multifunctional character of GAPDH was reported in macrophages where GAPDH serves as a surface receptor that is upregulated upon iron depletion (Rawat et al. 2012). Interestingly, T. vaginalis possesses two types of phosphofructokinase (PFK) (Liapounova et al. 2006) Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent PFK catalyzes reversible phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate in the cytosol (Mertens et al. 1998). More recently, putative ATP-dependent PFK has been identified in proteome of hydrogenosomes (Rada et al. 2011). Two of the three genes that encode the PPi-dependent PFK and one of two genes for the ATP-dependent PFK were upregulated under +Fe conditions (supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). The most significant changes in iron-dependent gene expression were associated with the pathways that follow the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the branch-point of carbohydrate metabolism. The enzymes that catalyze the formation of malate from PEP via oxaloacetate (PEP carboxykinase and malate dehydrogenase) were considerably upregulated under +Fe conditions ( fig. 3). In contrast, the pathway that converts malate to lactate was upregulated under \u00c0Fe conditions. This pathway involves cytosolic NADP-dependent ME and NADH-dependent lactate dehydrogenase ( fig. 3). These findings indicate that under +Fe conditions, malate preferentially enters the hydrogenosome and serves as a substrate for hydrogenosomal energy metabolism. However, under \u00c0Fe, when hydrogenosomal metabolism is ceased, malate is metabolized in the cytosol via pyruvate to lactate. Thus, the ability to switch between hydrogenosomal and cytosolic malate metabolism seems to be important for the ability of trichomonads to quickly adapt to changes in iron availability in their environment. Similar changes in carbohydrate metabolism were reported in T. vaginalis that had impaired hydrogenosomal metabolism because of the induction of metronidazole resistance (Kulda et al. 1993).",

In the related organism T. foetus, acetaldehyde that is reduced by ADH to ethanol is formed from pyruvate by the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (Sutak, Tachezy, et al. 2004). However, pyruvate decarboxylase activity was not detected in T. vaginalis, and the gene encoding this enzyme was not identified in the genome (Carlton et al. 2007).

The gene coding for ME-H was the most highly upregulated according to the EST analysis, with an upregulation index value of 63 (supplementary  table S2c, Supplementary Material online). The re-oxidation of NADH resulting from ME activity is mediated by heterodimeric NADH dehydrogenase (remnant of respiratory complex I). The 51 kDa subunit of this enzyme was significantly upregulated under +Fe conditions according to EST analysis, but the upregulation of the 24 kDa subunit did not reach the cutoff limit. Electrons generated by PFOR are transferred via ferredoxin to the hydrogenase responsible for the synthesis of molecular hydrogen. The genes that code for ferredoxin-1 and the 64 kDa [Fe]-hydrogenase were upregulated under +Fe conditions. Finally, the acetyl-CoA that is generated by PFOR activity is used in two steps of ATP synthesis: the reactions catalyzed by acetate:succinate-CoA transferase (ASCT) and heterodimeric succinyl-CoA synthase (SCS). One of the four ASCT genes and all of the genes that encode SCS subunits showed significant upregulation under +Fe conditions.",

In contrast to the components of energy metabolism, the ISC assembly machinery appeared to be upregulated under \u00c0Fe conditions ( fig. 4 and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). Our screen detected genes that encode two paralogs of the scaffold protein IscA, three Nfu paralogs, and the cysteine desulfurase IscS-2. Frataxin was previously shown to be upregulated under \u00c0Fe conditions using a nuclear run-on assay (Dolezal et al. 2007). This trend was also observed in our analysis, but the cut off limit was not reached (EST upregulation index \u00c02). Interestingly, \u00c0Fe conditions also caused a significant increase in the expression of the hydrogenase maturase (Hyd-G) that is required for the assembly of the hydrogenase-specific H cluster (Putz et al. 2006). Altogether, these results suggest a common regulatory mechanism for the genes that encode the multiple components of the ISC assembly machinery that are upregulated under \u00c0Fe conditions. This regulation might be related to the sensing of an increased cellular demand for FeS cluster synthesis during \u00c0Fe conditions.",

We detected four hydrogenosomal membrane proteins [two Hmp35 and two ADP/ATP carriers (AACs)] that were differentially expressed in response to iron availability (supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). Hmp35, which is a unique form of a b-barrel protein that is localized to the outer hydrogenosomal membrane, was significantly upregulated under +Fe conditions. Hmp35 is a cysteine-rich protein with the cysteine residues clustered near the C terminus, where they form a metal-binding motif (Dyall et al. 2003;Rada et al. 2011). These structural properties, together with the observed upregulation of the protein under +Fe conditions, allow us to speculate that Hmp35 may be involved in iron transport. Five members of the mitochondrial carrier protein family (MCF) that serve as AACs in the inner hydrogenosomal membrane have been identified (Dyall et al. 2000;Rada et al. 2011). In this study, two of these proteins showed significant iron-dependent regulation: AAC-1 was upregulated under \u00c0Fe conditions, whereas AAC-2 was upregulated under +Fe conditions ( fig. 4 and supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). As described earlier, active hydrogenosomal energy metabolism is dependent on iron. Under these conditions, a portion of the ATP synthesized in the hydrogenosomes is directly used by processes such as ISC assembly and HSP-70-dependent protein transport and maturation. Some ATP could also be exported by AACs to the cytosol in exchange for ADP as in mitochondria. However, ATP is also required for hydrogenosomal functions under iron-limiting conditions when the expression of enzymes necessary for ATP synthesis is ceased.  Thus, ATP might be imported from the cytosol by AACs. The expression of AAC-1 is increased under \u00c0Fe conditions, which renders it the most likely candidate for the transportation of ATP into hydrogenosomes.",

To date, four T. vaginalis Myb-like proteins have been characterized (Ong et al. 2006(Ong et al. , 2007Hsu et al. 2009;Smith et al. 2011). It was demonstrated that the temporal and iron-inducible transcription of the ME is regulated by the synergistic or antagonistic actions of three proteins that can selectively bind to two discrete Myb protein recognition sites in the 5 0 -untranslated regions (5'-UTR) of the ME gene. Myb1 and Myb2, that play the roles of a repressor and an activator, respectively, are able to bind to both sites with affinities that differ over time and according to iron availability (Ong et al. 2006(Ong et al. , 2007. Myb3 activates basal and prolonged iron-inducible transcription by binding solely to the MRE1 site (Hsu et al. 2009). In the T. vaginalis genome, there are three genes that encode Myb-3-like proteins, and all three products contain conserved base-contacting amino acids. Hsu et al. (2009) showed that the gene copy TVAG_475500 is upregulated under +Fe conditions. In our screen, we detected a second copy (TVAG_252420) that was upregulated under \u00c0Fe conditions. We also identified a Myb2 gene; however, under our experimental conditions, Myb2 was not regulated by iron, which contradicts the findings of Ong et al. (2007).",

The genes that contain both MRE1/MRE2r and MRE2f in their upstream regions, and that have the motifs in the same order as in ME upstream region, are listed in table 2. Interestingly, the 5 0 -UTR of the genes that encode ADH, hypothetical protein TVAG_383310 and thioredoxin reductase contain both elements at positions similar to those in the 5 0 -UTR sequence of the ME gene (table 2), which suggests a similar multifarious Myb-mediated regulation of transcription.",

The mechanistic origins and biological functions of these multiple gene copies are yet unknown, but it is clear that they provided abundant starting material for evolutionary innovation while also contributing to the genetic robustness of the organism (Li et al. 2010). Indeed, because the T. vaginalis genome appears to be haploid, genetic redundancy might be particularly important to buffer gene mutations. Moreover, the differential expression of paralogous copies could be necessary for optimal growth in response to various environmental conditions (Giaever et al. 2002). We demonstrated that iron, a critical nutrient for T. vaginalis, has broad effects on the parasite's trancriptome, which is consistent with the observation that iron modulates trichomonad growth, metabolic fluxes, and virulence phenotypes such as cytoadherence (Mundodi et al. 2006). However, we found that in most cases iron regulated the expression of a single gene or a portion of the gene copies, whereas the expression of other paralogous copies of the gene was iron independent.",

However, we also found that there were four gene copies for ME, and two for PFOR, whose expression was not iron dependent. Of all major enzymes involved in hydrogenosomal energy metabolism, only SCS, which mediates the final step of ATP synthesis, appears to be an exception in that the expression of all copies of both SCS subunits was iron dependent. Further studies of expression profiles for cells grown under various conditions such as the absence of external glucose, temperature or oxygen stress, the induction of the amoeboid form or comparison with nonpathogenic forms should lead to further insights as to how individual copies among the myriad trichomonad gene families have come to fall under differential iron regulation during evolution.",
