RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We measured brain fatty acid uptake in a group of 23 patients with MS and 7 age-matched healthy control subjects during fasting conditions using positron emission tomography (PET) with [ 11 C]-palmitate and [ 18 F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([ 18 F]-FTHA). Sixteen MS subjects were restudied after 6 weeks of very low calorie diet intervention. RESULTS-At baseline, brain global fatty acid uptake derived from [ 18 F]-FTHA was 50% higher in patients with MS compared with control subjects. The mean percentage increment was 130% in the white matter, 47% in the gray matter, and uniform across brain regions. In the MS group, the nonoxidized fraction measured using [ 11 C]-palmitate was 86% higher. Brain fatty acid uptake measured with [ 18 F]-FTHA-PET was associated with age, fasting serum insulin, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. Both total and nonoxidized fractions of fatty acid uptake were associated with BMI. Rapid weight reduction decreased brain fatty acid uptake by 17%. CONCLUSIONS-To our knowledge, this is the first study on humans to observe enhanced brain fatty acid uptake in patients with MS. Both fatty acid uptake and accumulation appear to be increased in MS patients and reversed by weight reduction.",

Both brain FFA uptake and metabolism are currently insufficiently defined, whereas the importance of FFAs in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MS) is demon-strated widely in other organs (6,7). Animal studies have demonstrated that hypothalamic sensing of circulating fatty acids in general is believed to be important in controlling nutrient intake and, thus, energy balance. For example, Pocai et al. (5) showed that manipulation of central hypothalamic FFA metabolism normalizes energy and glucose homeostasis in overfed rats. These regulatory processes are difficult to address in humans in vivo, and most data in this regard have been demonstrated in small animals (1,4,5,8). More work is needed to clarify the mechanisms behind the complex hypothalamic regulatory circuitry that regulates energy expenditure and feeding behavior.",

Healthy patients were nonobese and had normal oral glucose tolerance test results, whereas the 23 MS patients had MS according to the current International Diabetes Federation criteria (14) ( Table  2). According to the criteria, a person defined as having MS must have central obesity, defined as increased waist circumference plus at least two other additional criteria (raised triglycerides/blood pressure/fasting glucose or reduced HDL). Subjects were told to use no alcohol during the study period. Smoking was an exclusion criterion. Only 1 of 23 subjects with MS used medication (ACE inhibitor for blood pressure). Written informed consents were obtained after explaining the purpose and potential risks of the study to the subjects. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland and conducted according to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki. Study design. The study was designed to assess 1) the differences between MS patients and healthy individuals at baseline, and 2) the effect of a very low caloric diet (VLCD) in MS patients. Two PET studies were performed, first with [ 11 C]-palmitate, and thereafter with [ 18 F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([ 18 F]-FTHA), either during the same day or on separate days within 1 week. A subgroup of patients with MS (n \u03ed 16) were prescribed a VLCD. All daily meals were replaced by diet products for 6 weeks (Nutrifast, Leiras, Finland, 2.3 MJ (megajoule), 4.5 g fat, 59 g protein, and 72 g carbohydrate per day). After the diet there was a 1-week recovery period with an isocaloric diet to avoid catabolic state. The isocaloric diet was based on estimations of energy expenditure and was introduced by a physician. The assessments using PET were repeated. Magnetic resonance images were obtained for anatomical reference. Production and nature of radiotracers. The production of [ 11 C]-palmitate (half-life 20.4 min) (15) and the production of [ 18 F]-FTHA (half-life 109 min): (16) are described elsewhere. The radiochemical purity of the final product was \u03fe98% for both tracers.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate brain FFA uptake in obese patients with MS. The main finding of the study is that patients with MS have higher FFA uptake in the brain compared with healthy subjects. Weight loss reduced FFA uptake more in healthy subjects, and this was more due to decreased FFA oxidation rather than decreased metabolic FFA utilization. We and others have previously used [ 18 F]-FTHA and PET to quantify regional FFA metabolism, especially in myocardium and skeletal muscle (18,20,21). Recently we showed that [ 18 F]-FTHA accumulates in the brain in significant amounts (18), thus making it a reliable tracer to quantify brain FFA uptake. The brain tissue-input ratio for [ 18 F]-FTHA ratio was high, suggesting that [ 18 F]-FTHA crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates persistently and in measurable amounts. More than half of the tracer was going into the lipids, and less than half into the breakdown products (18). These breakdown products likely represent oxidation, so the study results suggest that [ 18 F]-FTHA reflects total uptake. [ 11 C]-palmitate has been shown to accumulate in monkey brain (9) and the extracted fraction is independent of cerebral flow (22). Palmitate accumulation in the brain has also been verified in rats (11,(23)(24)(25), and the flux is proportional to published values for regional brain oxidative metabolism (23). Longchain saturated fatty acids such as [ 11 C]-palmitate enter, to a large extent (50 -60%), via \u2424-oxidation in mitochondria, creating radioactive, aqueous metabolites, particularly glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate, whereas the other half is incorporated into lipids (22,26,27). After the fast oxidation of [ 11 C]-palmitate, the remaining radioactivity thus enters the stable lipid pool of the brain representing nonoxidative residual. It has been suggested that 83% of brain radioactivity is in stable compartments within 2 min after a steady-state level of plasma palmitate is achieved (9). Plasma [ 11 C]-palmitate activity in our study was stable shortly after 5 min in each person. Because the analysis was done using time frames of 10 -20 min, the palmitate results from brain can be considered to represent incorporation to stable compartments, and thus the so-called nonoxidative residual. We speculate that by combining the information F]-FTHA was not uniformly increased in all brain areas. The total FFA uptake was significantly greater in the white matter among subjects with MS compared with healthy controls, and the increment appeared to be of larger magnitude than that in the gray matter. The increase in white matter [ 18 F]-FTHA uptake could contribute to previous findings of brain white matter expansion among obese subjects (28). The differ- ence with [ 11 C]-palmitate between groups was more uniform and thus statistically significant in all analyzed areas. The hypothalamic area, now associated with fatty acid sensing and regulation of energy balance and feeding (2,4), had also increased uptake of ",

The normalization of hypothalamic lipid sensing has been linked to normalization of energy and glucose homeostasis (5). From our study results, it seems that the normal catabolic effect of central FFAs is disturbed in obesity, and this is at least partially reversible after weight loss. Peripheral insulin resistance contributing to MS could also affect the brain. In healthy pigs, hyperinsulinemia induced \u03f320 -50% decrease in brain [ 18 F]-FTHA radioactivity compared with fasting state (18). The hypothesized central insulin resistance could interfere with brain glucose utilization, thus resulting in compensatory increased FFA uptake and FFA oxidation. Weight loss is known to improve insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid profile (30). The beneficial effect of weight loss was observed in our study among MS patients; in addition to beneficial peripheral effects, FFA uptake in the brain was uniformly decreased due to a decrease in FFA oxidation. The correlations from our study corroborate this line of interference: FFA uptake was positively correlated with BMI, plasma insulin, and HOMA-index; among these, BMI had the strongest correlation. Brain FFA uptake also increased with ageing, suggesting that ageing is related to degenerative changes in the metabolic processes, and reinforcing the theory that age is a risk factor for MS.",

            "text": "Limitations in this study were the small number of subjects in the healthy control group and the fact that all of the healthy subjects were males. If sex is used in the statistical model as a covariate, the group difference in [ 18 F]-FTHA uptake persists in the white matter (group \u03eb region: F \u03ed 6.72, P \u03ed 0.007; main effect of group in the white matter: F \u03ed 4.92, P \u03ed 0.037), but not in other brain regions, and no significant effects are seen with [ 18 F]palmitate. In addition, female patients with MS had higher uptake values for both radioligands than male patients with MS. Future studies including healthy females should establish whether a significant interaction exists between sex and disease status, such that female patients may be more severely affected than male patients, as current data suggest. However, we think that a simple confounding main effect of sex is unlikely to explain the current results, based on three facts. First, [ 18 F]-FTHA uptake is increased in MS in white matter even when sex is taken into account. Second, significant correlations were seen between fatty acid uptake and clinical variables, such as BMI and fasting plasma glucose, suggesting that increased fatty acid uptake is more likely related to metabolic abnormalities than sex alone. Third, the significant decrease in fatty acid uptake after weight loss argues against a main effect of sex because such main effect would not be reversible. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the skewed sex distribution as a limitation to the interpretation of the results, and recommend that sex be taken into account in future studies. The number of subjects having MS differs in cross-section versus VLCD intervention. The first phase of the study was only cross-sectional. After having positive results from phase 1, we wanted to study in more detail the possibility that brain FFA uptake is related to weight. The more comprehensive phase two (VLCD intervention) was introduced in the study protocol and the last 16 of 23 subjects took part in this phase. Another limiting factor is that the brain kinetics of [ 18 F]-FTHA is not known so well as in other organs and was assumed to be taken up as natural palmitate. Although the in vivo biodistribution of [ 18 F]-FTHA in the brain suggests that [ 18 F]-FTHA represents total uptake, it does not prove that it equals uptake of natural FFAs. In our study, the total oxidation of [ 11 C]palmitate was found to be less than 50%. In the animal studies, it has been found that approximately 60% of the [ 11 C]-palmitate enters to \u2424-oxidation (9). It is possible that the kinetic properties of [ 18 F]-FTHA differ slightly from our assumption, explaining the slight difference between our study and animal studies. Nevertheless, this would not affect the differences found between the two groups. The dosages of injected tracers did not explain the findings, even when weight was taken into account. In addition, the isocaloric diet was not controlled, but the subjects were free to eat what they wanted. So the quality and quantity of the foods probably differ between subjects.",

Weight loss is able to partly reverse this abnormality. These novel findings highlight the possible role of brain FFAs in regulation of body weight. It seems that the normal catabolic effect of central FFAs is disturbed in MS and this is partially reversed after weight loss.",
