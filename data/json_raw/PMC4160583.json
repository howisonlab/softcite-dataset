The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship among TG, HDL-C, TG/HDL-C ratio, and early-phase insulin secretion in normoglycemic and prediabetic subjects. Methods: We evaluated 663 Japanese subjects who underwent the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. On the basis of these results, the subjects were divided into four groups: those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n=341), isolated impaired fasting glucose (i-IFG; n=211), isolated impaired glucose tolerance (i-IGT; n=71), and combined IFG and IGT (IFG+IGT; n=40). Insulin secretion was estimated by the insulinogenic index (IGI) (\u0394insulin/\u0394glucose [30 to 0 minutes]) and disposition index (DI) (IGI/ homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance). Results: In prediabetic subjects (i-IFG, i-IGT, and IFG+IGT), linear regression analyses revealed that IGI and DI were positively correlated with HDL-C levels. Moreover, in subjects with i-IGT and (IFG+IGT), but not with i-IFG, the indices of insulin secretion were negatively correlated with the log-transformed TG and TG/HDL-C ratio. In both the subjects with i-IGT, multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that DI was positively correlated with HDL-C and negatively with log-transformed TG and TG/HDL-C ratio. On the other hand, in subjects with NGT, there was no association between insulin secretion and lipid profiles. Conclusion: These results revealed that serum TG and HDL-C levels have different impacts on early-phase insulin secretion on the basis of their glucose tolerance status."

One of the empirical indices that measures \u03b2-cell function, the insulinogenic index (IGI), is a surrogate measure of early-phase insulin secretion [1]; it calculates the difference between the postprandial insulin peak (measured at 30 minutes) and basal insulin in relation to the difference in glucose levels (IGI=\u0394Insulin0-30/\u0394Glucose0-30). The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) is used to estimate insulin sensitivity. Because the amount of insulin secreted by \u03b2-cells is strongly dependent on the prevailing degree of insulin sensitivity, accounting for differences in insulin sensitivity is a critical point when evaluating \u03b2-cell function. Therefore, in the present study, the disposition index (DI), which is the ratio of IGI relative to HOMA-IR (IGI/HOMA-R), was determined as this gives an adjusted measure of \u03b2-cell function that accounts for variations in insulin sensitivity [10].",

Blood samples were collected at 0 minute (fasting plasma glucose; FPG), 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours postchallenge plasma glucose (2 hr-PG) following the OGTT. The glucose tolerance status of each subject was classified based on the criteria of the American Diabetes Association (2011), as follows: NGT (FPG <100 mg/dL and 2 hr-PG levels <140 mg/dL), i-IFG (FPG of 100 to 125 mg/dL and 2 hr-PG levels <140 mg/dL), i-IGT (FPG \u2264125 mg/dL and 2 hr-PG levels of 140 to 199 mg/dL), and (IFG+IGT; FPG of 100 to 125 mg/dL and 2 hr-PG levels of 140 to 199 mg/dL) [11]. Subjects who were newly diagnosed with diabetes (according to the following definition: hemoglobin A1c \u22656.5%, FPG \u2265126 mg/dL, or 2 hr-PG \u2265200 mg/dL) were excluded [11]. Subjects who were on steroids or were taking drugs interfering with lipid metabolism, and those with IGI values of \u22640 were also excluded [12]. On the basis of the OGTT results, subjects with NGT (n=341), i-IFG (n=211), i-IGT (n=71), and IFG+IGT (n=40) were selected for the present study.

In fact, among subjects with prediabetes, hypertriglyceridemia is demonstrated as a predictor of T2DM progression [14]. Elevated TG levels induce \u03b2-cell apoptosis by increasing the levels of ceramide and nitric oxide [15,16]. On the other hand, HDL-C stimulates insulin secretion by interacting with ABCA1, the ATP-binding cassette transporter G1, or the scavenger receptor B1, and it also inhibits \u03b2-cells apoptosis [4]. Therefore, subjects with Tangier disease, which is caused by an ABCA1 mutation, exhibit impaired insulin secretion [17].",

Although the specific reason for this inconsistency is unknown, it is hypothesized that HDL-C may play an important role in protecting \u03b2-cells in subjects in the relatively late stages of hyperglycemia, particularly in Diabetes Metab J 2014;38:294-301 http://e-dmj.org those with prediabetes, whereas its protective effects are less apparent in those with NGT. Moreover, these indices of insulin secretion did not correlate with TG or the TG/HDL-C ratio in NGT subjects. Thus, our present study provides new insights into the pathophysiological differences in lipid levels and insulin secretion among normoglycemic and prediabetic subjects."

            "text": "The evidence now suggests that subjects with i-IFG and i-IGT may represent different populations, with more or less overlapping subclinical characteristics and pathophysiology. Isolated IGT is associated with an increase in cardiovascularrelated mortality and all-cause mortality [18]. On the other hand, i-IFG is a risk category for diabetes, but its relationship with atherosclerosis is less clear [19]. The present study revealed that insulin secretion correlated with TG, HDL-C, and the TG/HDL-C ratio in both men and women subjects with i-IGT. However, such correlations were not identified in i-IFG subjects, even though the sample size was the largest in this group among the three prediabetes subjects. Similar to the results reported by Lorenzo et al. [20], in our study, TG levels were higher in i-IGT subjects compared with i-IFG subjects. Van der Zijl et al. [21] showed that lipid accumulation in the pancreas was positively associated with TG levels and nega- Table 3. Associations of TG, HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C ratio with disposition index in total subjects  tively with HDL-C levels. Moreover, they reported that pancreatic fat content gradually increased with deterioration of glucose metabolism (NGT, 7.6%; IFG, 12.1%; and IGT, 22.4%), and an inverse relationship between pancreatic fat content and DI was observed [21]. In the present investigation, different association between lipid profiles and DI in i-IFG and i-IGT could be the result of differences in pancreatic fat content between the two groups. He et al. [22] found that TG and the TG/HDL-C ratio were independent risk factors for T2DM, and that TG/HDL-C was a stronger risk factor of the two. Moreover, Giannini et al. [23] reported that the TG/HDL-C ratio is associated with insulin resistance and may be used along with other factors to identify subjects at increased risk of insulin resistance-driven morbidity. In the present study, we investigated DI, which can be considered an index of pancreatic functionality and can predict the normal \u03b2-cell response adequate for any degree of insulin resistance [24]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to reveal that this index is correlated with the TG/HDL-C ratio in both men and women with i-IGT even after adjusting for the associated variables. Our results add further support to the notion that the TG/HDL-C ratio may be a clinically simple and useful indicator of insulin secretion independent of insulin sensitivity among subjects with i-IGT.",

Second, the current study had a small sample size and a high prevalence of men especially in subjects with IFG+IGT. Our sample size and disproportional distribution of gender may be insufficient to clearly confirm the association between lipid profile and insulin secretion in subjects with IFG+IGT. Third, and finally, we did not measure subclinical inflammatory markers (such as Creactive protein, interleukin-6, or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), which may affect insulin secretion. However, the strength and consistency of the association observed using routine biochemical measures may have beneficial implications for clinical practice."
