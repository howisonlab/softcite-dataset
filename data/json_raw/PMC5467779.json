This study investigated the influence of MTDH expression on gastric cancer and to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which MTDH regulates actin cytoskeletal remodeling and enhances human gastric cancer metastasis via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Relative MTDH mRNA expression levels were assessed by quantitative realtime PCR (Q-PCR), and MTDH protein expression levels and localization were evaluated via immunohistochemical (ICH) staining. We studied the role of MTDH in cancer cell migration and invasion by modulating MTDH expression in the gastric cancer cell lines MKN45 and AGS. We also confirmed the functions of MTDH through in vivo experiments. We found that MTDH expression levels were correlated with lymph node metastasis, TNM stages and decreased OS (P=0.002, <0.001 and 0.010, respectively) in human gastric cancer and that MTDH upregulation promoted EMT in vitro. Consistent with this finding, MTDH downregulation inhibited cell migration and invasion in vitro and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, MTDH knockdown regulated actin cytoskeletal remodeling and inhibited EMT. Overall, our results provide a novel role for MTDH in regulating gastric cancer metastasis.",

It was estimated that a total of 952,000 new cases of gastric cancer were diagnosed in 2012 and that 723,000 gastric cancer-related deaths occurred during the same year (2). Despite advances in surgical techniques and chemotherapies, metastasis remains the main obstacle to effective gastric cancer treatment (3,4). Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers for gastric cancer metastasis may facilitate the development of targeted therapies useful for the treatment of gastric cancer.",

Its expression was induced in primary human fetal astrocytes by HIV-1 or treatment with HIV envelope glycoproteins or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (5)(6)(7). In recent years, studies have shown that MTDH expression levels were elevated in many human malignancies, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (8)(9)(10)(11). Moreover, MTDH has been reported to play a vital role in tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance (12,13). A recent study (14) suggested that modulating the AEG-1/EMT pathway may inhibit hepatocarcinoma growth and metastasis. However, few studies have addressed whether MTDH expression levels are upregulated in gastric cancer and whether the protein participates in gastric cancer metastasis.",

Several studies (15,16) have demonstrated that protein-protein interactions in tight junction complexes are probably related to actin cytoskeletal remodeling, and tight junction disruption may cause the cytoskeletons of epithelial cells to transform into cytoskeletons characteristic of mesenchymal cells, leading to cell metastasis. It has been hypothesized (17) that tumor cell metastasis occurs via the following steps: invasion in situ, intravasation, survival in circulation, extravasation, micrometastasis and final colonization. EMT is the process in which epithelial cells with polarity transform into freely moving mesenchymal cells under specific physiological and pathological conditions and is the most important step in the induction of tumor cell invasion and metastasis in situ (18).",

The cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer supplemented with RIPA 10 \u00b5l/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a protease inhibitor, and protein concentrations were determined by a Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein assay kit. All of these reagents were purchased from the Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), which were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 2 h before being incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4\u02daC. The membranes were subsequently incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The protein bands were visualized by an Enhanced Chemiluminescence Detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and photographed by a Gel Logic 2200 PRO imaging system. The following primary antibodies were used in this experiment: an MTDH rabbit mAb (1:2000, Abcam), an E-cadherin rabbit mAb (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), a Slug rabbit mAb (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), a Snail rabbit pAb (1:1000, Abcam), an N-cadherin mouse mAb (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), a zO-1 mouse mAb (1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology), and a GAPDH mAb-HRP (1:5000, Bioworld Technology, Minneapolis, MN, USA). siRNA interference and stable knockdown cell line establishment. Four siRNA sequences targeting human MTDH mRNA were designed using RNAi designer (Oligo 6.0 software). A scrambled sequence of targeting MTDH sequences was used as a negative control. The control siRNA (MTDH-con si) targeting sequence was 5'-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACG UTT-3', the MTDH-siRNA#1 (si#1) targeting sequence was 5'-GCUGUUCGAACACCUCAAATT-3', the MTDH-siRNA#2 (si#2) targeting sequence was 5'-GCCGUAAUCA ACCCUAUAUTT-3' , and the MTDH-siRNA#3 (si#3) targeting sequence was 5'-GCCAUCUGUAAUCUUAUCATT-3'. The most effective siRNA sequence was selected, after which a hairpin structure (shRNA) was added to it. A recombinant lentivirus containing the corresponding MTDH-shRNA construct was subsequently produced via co-transfection of 293T cells with helper plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2G) with Lipofier (HanBio, Shanghai, China). After 48 h of transfection, the cultured supernatant was harvested, filtered and concentrated by ultra centrifugation. To establish stable MTDH-knockdown cell lines, we transduced the MKN45 and AGS cell lines with lentiviral RNAi vectors. After 72 h, the cells were treated with 2 \u00b5g/ml puromycin. The puromycin-resistant clones were selected and expanded for subsequent experiments.",

MTDH mRNA and protein expression levels in four gastric cancer cell lines (MKN45, AGS, SGC7901, and KATO-III) and a normal gastric mucosa cell line (GES-1) were examined by qPCR and western blotting, respectively ( Fig. 2A and B). We found that MTDH mRNA and protein expression levels were low in GES-1 and KATO-III cells and high in AGS and MKN45 cells. According to ATCC and the results of our previous study (23), MKN45 and AGS cells were highly invasive, but KATO-III cells were poorly invasive, suggesting that MTDH expression levels are correlated with gastric cancer cell metastasis. Moreover, both the MKN45 and the AGS cell lines, especially the MKN45 cell line, displayed easily observable morphological changes, such as migrationrelated protrusions. Therefore, the MKN45 and AGS cell lines were selected to establish stable shMTDH cells, which were used in subsequent experiments. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, MTDH-siRNA3 (si#3) displayed maximal knockdown efficiency, making it the ideal siRNA to which a hairpin structure could be added, as well as the ideal siRNA with which stable shMTDH-MKN45 (MKN45-sh#3) and shMTDH-AGS cell lines (AGS-sh#3) could be established ( Fig. 2E and F).  investigate the invasion and the migration ability of different gastric cancer cells, we conducted scratch-wound healing and transwell assays. As shown in Fig. 3A, in the scratch-wound healing assay, the migratory range of the MKN45 cells was decreased after MTDH expression levels were downregulated. Consistent with this finding, scratch-wound coverage was significantly decreased in this cell line at 48 h post-wound placement (P= 0.010; Fig. 3B). Similar results were observed in the experiments involving the AGS cells (P= 0.004; Fig. 3B  and C).",

This study demonstrated that MTDH played a significant role in gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. MTDH expression levels were elevated in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal gastric mucosal tissues, and MTDH expression levels were significantly increased in metastatic gastric cancer tissues compared with non-metastatic gastric cancer tissues. The OS time for patients with gastric cancer with high MTDH expression levels was shorter than the OS time for patients with gastric cancer with low MTDH expression levels. These results suggested that MTDH expression levels were correlated with clinical metastasis and patient survival. We also found that suppressing MTDH expression could inhibit gastric cancer cell migration and invasion ability in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MTDH expression can regulate cytoskeletal remodeling and is strongly correlated with changes in EMT marker (E-cadherin, zO-1, Slug, Snail, and N-cadherin) expression. MTDH downregulation decreased cell migratory protrusions and inhibit EMT process in both MKN45 cells and AGS cells. Thus, our study not only elucidated the role of MTDH in gastric cancer but also at least partially elucidated the mechanism through which MTDH facilitates gastric cancer metastasis.",

            "text": "MTDH was first identified as a novel protein known as LYRIC, a known cell adhesion molecule and tumor suppressor (25,26). Britt et al (6) found that LYRIC was colocalized with the tight junction proteins zO-1 and occludin in polarized epithelial cells and showed that LYRIC can be recruited during tight junction complex maturation. Other studies (27)(28)(29) demonstrated that tight junction proteins, such as claudin-1, occludin, and zO-1, can act as tumor suppressors. In the event of tight junction complex disruption (which is associated with decrease in zO-1 and claudin-1 expression), MTDH dissociates from the cell adhesion protein complex, resulting in actin cytoskeletal remodeling and EMT induction. In this study, we found MTDH promotes gastric cancer cell metastasis. When we downregulated MTDH expression in MKN45 and AGS cells, the cells displayed decreased number of migration-related protrusions, and the EMT course was inhibited. Our study first demonstrated that MTDH promotes gastric cancer metastasis through actin cytoskeletal remodeling. During EMT, cells undergo morphological changes through which they lose their polarity, assume a mesenchymal cell-like spindle shape and develop migratory protrusions. Moreover, cells undergo changes in the expression levels of their differentiation markers, resulting in a shift from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype, and functional changes leading to extracellular matrix (ECM) invasion (30)(31)(32). Disrupting cell-cell adhesion induced cell polarity loss and cytoskeletal remodeling, during which cells lost their polygonal epithelial cell-like features and developed mesenchymal cell-like features (33,34). We also demonstrated that both MKN45 cells and AGS cells transformed from elongated spindle-shaped cells with migratory protrusions into nearly polygonal, smooth-edged, and epithelial-like cells upon MTDH downregulation. A well-known EMT inducer (35), TGF-\u03b21 promoted EMT in MKN45 and AGS cells and induced comparable changes in cell morphology and EMT marker protein expression in the MKN45 and AGS siMTDH cell lines. Taken together, these data show that MTDH upregulation regulates actin cytoskeletal remodeling and induces EMT in gastric cancer cell metastasis. Likewise, many studies (19,36,37) reported that pseudopodial protrusion and formation of related invadopodia have long been associated with tumor cell migration and invasion, and dynamic actin cytoskeleton remodeling was closely related to EMT. However, although our study indicated that downregulating MTDH expression could induce actin cytoskeleton remodeling and inhibit EMT in MKN45 cells and AGS cells, we thought it was unable to completely block EMT. EMT could be regulated by many pathway, such as Wnt signaling, cytokine signaling, Notch signaling (38). Emdad et al (39) reported that MTDH promoted tumor invasion and metastasis by activating the nuclear factor kappaB pathway. Hu et al (40) showed that MTDH may promote breast cancer metastasis by facilitating interactions between a lung-homing domain and an unknown receptor located on the surface of endothelial cells, as well as NF-\u03baB signaling pathway activation. Hence, MTDH can promote cancer cell metastasis through many different processes warranting further investigation.",
