            "text": "Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is caused by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV; human herpesvirus 8). KS is an AIDS-defining cancer, and it is changing in the post-antiretroviral therapy (post-ART) era. In countries with ready access to ART, approximately one-third of KS cases present in patients with undetectable HIV loads and CD4 counts of >200 cells/l. This is in contrast to pre-ART era KS, which was associated with systemic HIV replication and CD4 counts of <200 cells/l. Using primary patient biopsy specimens, we identified a novel molecular signature that characterizes AIDS KS lesions that develop in HIV-suppressed patients on ART: KSHV transcription is limited in HIV-suppressed patients. With one exception, only the canonical viral latency mRNAs were detectable. In contrast, early AIDS KS lesions expressed many more viral mRNAs, including, for instance, the viral G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR). IMPORTANCE This is the first genomewide study of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) transcription in KS lesions in the post-antiretroviral (post-ART) era. It shows that the gene expression of KSHV is altered in patients on ART, and it provides clinical evidence for active AIDS (as characterized by high HIV load and low CD4 counts) being a potential modulator of KSHV transcription. This implies a novel mode of pathogenesis (tightly latent KS), which may inform KS cancer treatment options in the post-ART era."

This is not entirely unexpected since the classic (HIV-negative) form of KS is not associated with significant immunosuppression (8). Histologically, KS lesions can be classified into patch, plaque, and nodal stages, but molecular markers of KS subclasses are missing. We observed previously that AIDS KS lesions varied in their pattern of KSHV mRNA levels. Some exhibited high-level KSHV lytic gene transcription, whereas others expressed only the limited set of viral latent genes (9,10). Here, we set out to molecularly classify AIDS KS that developed in the presence of successful ART (i.e., in the absence of ongoing HIV replication).",

The \u2424-actin mRNA level for a group of AIDS KS samples had a mean C T of 29.31 with a 95% CI of 26.52 to 32.10. There was no statistical difference in the \u2424-actin levels based on the Welch two-sample t test. If anything, we had slightly more mRNA from the post-HAART biopsy specimens, and thus a higher sensitivity of detecting lytic KSHV mRNAs if there were any. This suggests that the lack of lytic mRNA detection in the HIV-suppressed KS lesions was not due to lesser sensitivity or systematic technical differences among both groups, but reflects the biology of the virus. Based on our recent experience in analyzing KS mRNA levels in clinical trials (12,13), we choose to normalize to a common stable mRNA that encodes latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), vCycl, and vFLIP (9). This mRNA as well as the LANA protein is expressed in every KSHV-infected KS tumor cell, latent and lytic, based on in situ studies (9,14). The level of this \"tricistronic\" mRNA does not change dramatically upon reactivation in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) (15,16) and is also present upon replication in endothelial cells (17). We therefore normalized all mRNA signals to LANA gene expression. Normalizing to LANA mRNA thus normalized to the number of KS tumor cells within a biopsy specimen rather than nonneoplastic tumor infiltrating and/or stromal cells. Figure 2C demonstrates the heterogeneity of KS lesions with regard to LANA-expressing cells. This uses a larger data set of KS lesions in HIV-suppressed patients than that in reference 13. The mRNA levels of two different so-called housekeeping genes, coding for actin and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), correlated well (Pearson correlation, r \u03ed 0.85) (Fig. 2C). The mRNA levels of two different latent genes, coding for vCyc and LANA, correlated well (Pearson correlation, r \u03ed 0.96). However, the correlation between either viral mRNA and either host mRNA was substantially lower, with a mean of 0.54 and a range of 0.45 to 0.64. This attests to the fact that different KS lesions contain different numbers of KSHV-infected cells. The possibility to thus factor out non-tumor cells represents one of the major advantage of using viral mRNA levels as biomarkers as opposed to cellular mRNAs, for which it is often not possible to discern between tumor cell inherent changes and changes due to differences in tumor content within a biopsy specimen.",

We saw no significant correlation between lytic mRNAs in KS and those in PEL after viral reactivation (data not shown): i.e., those that are part of the canonical cascade of gene expression leading to successful viral replication, viral egress, and consequent host cell death (18). This suggests that within a KS lesion, KSHV expression is dysregulated. It does not seem to follow the highly ordered cascade of gene expression needed for viral replication, and many KSHV proteins that were classified as lytic, based on early studies in PEL, seem to serve a function in tumorigenesis as well as for virus production. The precedent here is the K1 protein, which we found in a subset of KS lesions (19), even though the gene coding for it had been classified as a \"lytic\" gene. Another one is K2/vIL6, which responds directly to interferon (IFN) signaling in the absence of productive replication and to the viral transactivator RTA (replication and transcription activator) in the context of viral reactivation and replication (20). Culture-based studies also lend credence to the involvement of many more than the canonical latent genes in KS pathogenesis. Grundhoff and Ganem postulated a role for intermittent lytic reactivation for KSHV persistence (21), and Chandriani and Ganem recently found evidence for variable, but significant expression of vIL6 and K1 in PEL cell lines (22). This is the first report of this phenomenon in clinical KS biopsy specimens.",

            "text": "Implications for clinical studies. AIDS KS takes a more aggressive clinical course than transplant-associated or classic KS (reviewed in reference 23). Classic KS in particular is associated with minuscule amounts of systemically circulating virus (24). Our study provides new evidence for a postulated role of HIV in AIDS KS, perhaps through HIV-tat (25) or perhaps through cellular cytokines that reactivate KSHV in the setting of low CD4 T cells. There exists another explanation with potentially great clinical relevance. Particular drugs within the ART regimen could stymie KSHV reactivation and replication. One such candidate drug, nelfinavir, has recently emerged (26). Finally, to borrow from detailed insights into HSV-1 reactivation (27), it may be that in patients with high CD4 counts there exists a sufficient number of KSHV cognate CD8 cells, which even though they cannot prevent lesion occurrence per se, may limit viral reactivation and rapidly eliminate cells that express lytic KSHV proteins. There are limitations to this interpretation, which need further studies. We could not separate the effect of HIV levels from CD4 depletion, as these were coupled AIDS KS. We also cannot discern the impact of different ART regimens with regard to KSHV transcription. It is quite possible that particular drug regimens influence KS and KSHV differentially (28).",
