            "text": "This study examined whether the presence of peripheral sensory neuropathy or cardiac autonomic deficits is associated with postocclusive reactive hyperemia (reflective of microvascular function) in the diabetic foot. Research design and methods: 99 participants with type 2 diabetes were recruited into this crosssectional study. The presence of peripheral sensory neuropathy was determined with standard clinical tests and cardiac autonomic function was assessed with heart rate variation testing. Postocclusive reactive hyperemia was measured with laser Doppler in the hallux. Multiple hierarchical regression was performed to examine relationships between neuropathy and the peak perfusion following occlusion and the time to reach this peak. Results: Peripheral sensory neuropathy predicted 22% of the variance in time to peak following occlusion (p<0.05), being associated with a slower time to peak but was not associated with the magnitude of the peak. Heart rate variation was not associated with the postocclusive reactive hyperemia response. Conclusions: This study found an association between the presence of peripheral sensory neuropathy in people with diabetes and altered microvascular reactivity in the lower limb.",

            "text": "Microvascular dysfunction is common in diabetes and acts as a major contributor to cardiovascular disease 1 as well as lower limb complications. 2 Regulation of the microvasculature is complex and relies on endothelial function, myogenic input, as well as neurological contributions. 3 Dysfunction of neurological contributions may occur in those with diabetic neuropathy. In this way, diabetic neuropathy, while being a microvascular complication, may in turn affect microvascular functioning. 3 In the foot, autonomic neuropathy results in a loss of sympathetic activity in peripheral blood vessels causing vasodilation and increased arterial flow. 4 However, the increase in blood flow bypasses the cutaneous structures due to the opening of arteriovenous shunts, resulting in local ischemia. 4 Neuropathy has also been associated with reductions in microvascular reactivity that are likely to contribute to the development of ulceration, impaired healing, and difficulty fighting infection. 5 6 Capacity for vasodilation can be assessed by measuring local skin blood flow while introducing stressors such as heat and iontophoresis of chemical substances. This approximates the capacity in that individual to mount blood flow and inflammatory responses to injury 5 and can also be indicative of early cardiovascular disease. 7 While reduced vasodilation in response to heat and iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) has been observed in the presence of diabetic neuropathy, [8][9][10] the effect of neuropathy on postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) is less explored.",

All participants were adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and were excluded if they were pregnant, took corticosteroids, or hormone replacement therapy, had osteoporosis, chronic renal failure, current bilateral foot ulceration, neuropathic osteoarthropathy, malignancy, endocrine disorders (other than diabetes) or a recent history of foot trauma. Ethics was obtained from the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Details of glycated hemoglobin, the presence of retinopathy and other medical history, date of diabetes diagnosis, and medication use were obtained from medical history supplied by the participant's general practitioner. Participants refrained from nicotine, caffeine, and exercise for 2 hours and lay supine for at least 10 min prior to testing while room temperature was controlled at 23-24\u00b0C. Tests were performed in the following order: monofilament detection, vibration perception, sharp/ blunt detection, and temperature detection followed by PORH and heart rate variation testing.

Such information is useful in the early diagnosis and  management of diabetic foot complications. This study aimed to investigate relationships between clinically detectable peripheral sensory neuropathy, cardiac autonomic deficits, and the PORH response in the periphery. The presence of sensory neuropathy predicted 22% of the variance in the timing of the response but did not predict its magnitude. Heart rate variation did not predict temporal or magnitudinal aspects of the response. These findings are in keeping with previous studies that have shown other microvascular reactivity parameters to be affected by the presence of neuropathy. The role of nerves in the blood flow response to heating and ACh iontophoresis and the effect of neuropathy on those responses are more established than in the PORH response. 15 23 Numerous studies have demonstrated that in the presence of diabetic neuropathy, there is a reduction in blood flow response to heating 9 10 and iontophoresis of ACh. [8][9][10] PORH is thought to be mediated by a mix of metabolic dilators, endothelial dilators, myogenic relaxation, and sensory nerve activity. 16 The work of Larkin and Williams 24 and Lorenzo and Minson 16 demonstrated the role of sensory nerves in PORH by showing a reduction in the response following anesthetization. This suggests that the presence of neuropathy should also reduce the response. In support of this, Yamamoto-Suganuma and Aso 7 showed that a reduction in magnitude of the response is associated with slower sensory nerve conduction speed.",

A large proportion of the participants in this study had clinically detectable neuropathy suggesting a more advanced state of the condition. It is unknown if increases in myogenic activity remain in the presence of advanced neuropathy, and therefore, such a relationship cannot be assumed in this instance.

Those with peripheral vascular disease were not excluded from participation in the current study, which may have affected the results. However, resting toe pressures of participants were <50 mm Hg in only 3 of the 99 participants, so severe peripheral arterial disease is not likely to have influenced the results. Evidence of other microvascular disease (retinopathy) was obtained from medical history and strict classification was not applied to diagnosis. Given the high prevalence of neuropathy in the study cohort, it is likely that the incidence of retinopathy was higher than that reported in this study. In addition to these concerns, other factors to consider in future research include the influence of edema and factors affecting blood viscosity on the PORH response. A major consideration in this work is that it is unclear to what extent the PORH response is reflective of the microvascular disease that causes neuropathy. Although diabetes-induced alterations in vascular and metabolic pathways are implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropathy, the disease is considered a microvascular complication of diabetes due to the predominance of the ischemic pathway. 3 Endoneural blood vessels display cell hyperplasia and capillary basement membrane thickening 27 causing hypoperfusion and ischemia to the nerves, predominating in the lower limbs. 28 These changes also occur to the cutaneous microvasculature. 28 Owing to the cross-sectional nature of the current study, the extent to which neuropathy caused the observed changes to PORH or microvascular disease affected the changes to PORH and neuropathy cannot be determined.",

Arora et al 8 found that the reductions in the response to heating and iontophoresis of ACh seen in those with neuropathy were not concurrent with changes to sodium nitroprusside (which does not stimulate nerve fibers). This was confirmed by Caselli et al. 29 Furthermore, the temporal relationships between microvascular disease and diabetic neuropathy have recently been under dispute. 30 There is likely to be a cycle present whereby microvascular disease contributes to neuropathy, which contributes to further microvascular dysfunction. 3 Microvascular and neural complications of diabetes are major contributors to lower limb pathology in diabetes. The impact of diabetic neuropathy on microvascular function is complex and under-researched. This study aimed to investigate whether clinically detectable peripheral sensory neuropathy or cardiac autonomic neuropathy was indicative of a reduction in the capability for vasodilation that may be relevant in cases of ulceration and non-healing. The study found that the presence of peripheral sensory neuropathy in diabetes was associated with slower TtP dilatory response to ischemia. Future research should investigate whether this change in the PORH response is relevant for pathology as well as the causal link between neuropathy and microvascular dysfunction.",
