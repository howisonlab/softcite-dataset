However, there is little experimental evidence for the direct role of FOXO1 in GC. In the present study, we investigated the effect of FOXO1 on the tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in GC and its relationship with SIRT1. Materials and Methods Stable GC cell lines (SNU-638 and SNU-601) infected with a lentivirus containing FOXO1 shRNA were established for animal studies as well as cell culture experiments. We used xenograft tumors in nude mice to evaluate the effect of FOXO1 silencing on tumor growth and angiogenesis. In addition, we examined the association between FOXO1 and SIRT1 by immunohistochemical tissue array analysis of 471 human GC specimens and Western blot analysis of xenografted tumor tissues. Results In cell culture, FOXO1 silencing enhanced hypoxia inducible factor-1! (HIF-1!) expression and GC cell growth under hypoxic conditions, but not under normoxic conditions. The xenograft study showed that FOXO1 downregulation enhanced tumor growth, microvessel areas, HIF-1! activation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. In addition, inactivated FOXO1 expression was associated with SIRT1 expression in human GC tissues and xenograft tumor tissues. Conclusion Our results indicate that FOXO1 inhibits GC growth and angiogenesis under hypoxic conditions via inactivation of the HIF-1!-VEGF pathway, possibly in association with SIRT1. Thus, development of treatment modalities aiming at this pathway might be useful for treating GC."

            "text": "The mammalian forkhead transcription factors of the O class (FOXOs) have four members: FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6. FOXO1 and FOXO3 are expressed in nearly all tissues [1]. When FOXOs are phosphorylated, they are exported from the nucleus and do not exhibit transcriptional activity [2]. In recent years, FOXOs have caught much research attention for their broad roles in physiological process, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, angiogenesis, stress resistance, energy metabolism, and stem cell differentiation [3]. Dysregulation of FOXOs results in disease, including cancer. Inactivation of the FOXO1 occurs in many types of human cancer, including endometrial cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma and gastric cancer (GC) [1].",

Among them, SIRT1 is the most thoroughly studied and is expressed in the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle, spleen, and adipose tissues [5]. SIRT1 regulates physiological events that include oxidative stress, metabolism, cellular proliferation, and genomic stability via deacetylation of histone and non-histone proteins [5]. Furthermore, SIRT1 targets many transcription factors, including p53, FOXO, E2F1 and nuclear factor kB, and consequently is involved in diverse functions [6].",

            "text": "HIF-1!, which regulates many genes involved in adapting to a hypoxic environment, is important in promoting gastric tumor growth and angiogenesis [14]. Therefore, we performed cell culture experiments using GC cell lines SNU-638 and SNU-601 to examine the direct relationship between the expressions of FOXO1 and HIF-1!. GC cells expressing control shRNA or FOXO1 shRNA were cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. By Western blot, FOXO1 down-regulation corresponded with increased HIF-1! protein expression under hypoxic conditions, but not under normoxic conditions, in both cell lines (Fig. 1D). Fig. 1A shows that FOXO1 expression was higher in SNU-601 cells than in SNU-638 cells. In contrast, we found that cell growth rate was higher in SNU-638 cells than in SNU-601 cells, which became more evident under hypoxic conditions ( Fig. 2A). To confirm the growth-inhibitory role of FOXO1, we compared the viability of GC cell lines under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. At 24 hours of hypoxic exposure, in both GC cell lines FOXO1 knockdown increased cell viability under hypoxic conditions, but not under normoxic conditions (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B and C). These data suggest that the effect of FOXO1 on GC cell growth needs a hypoxic environment. Fig. 2A shows that SNU-638 cells grow faster than SNU-601 cells. Thus, to examine the role of FOXO1 in GC growth, we injected SNU-638 cells rather than SNU-601 cells into nude mice. Stable SNU-638 cells expressing non-targeting (control) or FOXO1-targeting shRNA were used. We found that tumors were successfully formed in all mice. The tumor weights were markedly higher in mice injected with FOXO1 shRNA expressing cells than those injected with control shRNA expressing cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A).",

CD31 immunoreactivity increased in FOXO1 shRNA tumors compared to control shRNA tumors (Fig. 3B, second row). Optical image analyses showed that the CD31-positive MVA was noticeably larger in FOXO1 shRNA tumors (mean, 18.56!10 3 pixels 2 ) than in control shRNA tumors (mean, 3.25!10 3 pixels 2 ) (Fig. 3B, right).

Dependent upon the post-translational changes on FOXOs, SIRT1 can inhibit FOXO activity to protect cells from oxidative stress [23] or increase the activity of FOXOs to lead to gene activation [24]. The present study showed a positive association between the expression of inactive form of FOXO1 and nuclear expression of SIRT1 in human GC specimens. Furthermore, animal studies showed that FOXO1 silencing increased SIRT1 expression in GC xenografts. Thus, our data and those from a previous study [22] indicate that FOXO1 suppresses GC angiogenesis through HIF-1!/SIRT1 pathway. Although the relationships between FOXO1 and HIF-1! and that of SIRT1 and HIF-1! have been reported [1,6], the FOXO1-SIRT1 pathway that ties to regulation of angiogenesis in GC or any type of cancer has not been. FOXO1 may suppress tumors through different strategies depending on the tumor type. For the first time, we report that FOXO1 suppresses angiogenesis through the HIF-1! and VEGF and FOXO1-SIRT1 pathway.",
