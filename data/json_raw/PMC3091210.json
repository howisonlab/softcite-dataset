            "text": "The determinants of single channel conductance (\u2425) and ion selectivity within eukaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels have traditionally been ascribed to amino acid residues within the second transmembrane domain and flanking sequences of their component subunits. However, recent evidence suggests that \u2425 is additionally controlled by residues within the intracellular and extracellular domains. We examined the influence of two anionic residues (Asp 113 and Asp 127) within the extracellular vestibule of a high conductance human mutant 5-hydroxytryptamine type-3A (5-HT 3 A) receptor (5-HT 3 A(QDA)) upon \u2425, modulation of the latter by extracellular Ca 2\u0609 , and the permeability of Ca 2\u0609 with respect to Cs \u0609 (P Ca / P Cs). Mutations neutralizing (Asp 3 Asn), or reversing (Asp 3 Lys), charge at the 113 locus decreased inward \u2425 by 46 and 58%, respectively, but outward currents were unaffected. The D127N mutation decreased inward \u2425 by 82% and also suppressed outward currents, whereas the D127K mutation caused loss of observable single channel currents. The forgoing mutations, except for D127K, which could not be evaluated, ameliorated suppression of inwardly directed single channel currents by extracellular Ca 2\u0609. The P Ca /P Cs of 3.8 previously reported for the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) construct was reduced to 0.13 and 0.06 by the D127N and D127K mutations, respectively, with lesser, but clearly significant, effects caused by the D113N (1.04) and D113K (0.60) substitutions. Charge selectivity between monovalent cations and anions (P Na /P Cl) was unaffected by any of the mutations examined. The data identify two key residues in the extracellular vestibule of the 5-HT 3 A receptor that markedly influence \u2425, P Ca /P Cs , and additionally the suppression of \u2425 by Ca 2\u0609 .",

The ECD is rich in \u2424-sheet and loop motifs and contributes to the ligand binding site, which is located at subunit interfaces, and the extracellular vestibule of the ion channel. The transmembrane domain comprises four \u2423-helical stretches (TM1-TM4) organized such that TM1, TM3, and TM4 shield TM2 from the lipid bilayer (8,9). The TM regions are linked by extracellular (TM2-TM3) and intracellular (TM1-TM2 and TM3-TM4) loops. TM2 forms the lining of the transmembrane portion of the ion channel and contains the channel gate (9). The TM3-TM4 linker (the large intracellular loop) forms the bulk of the intracellular domain and is the least conserved region of the subunit peptide across the pLGIC receptor family. The structure of the intracellular domain is largely unresolved, apart from an \u2423-helical region (the MA stretch) that is located immediately N-terminal to TM4 in images of the Torpedo nACh receptor obtained by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) (9,12).",

However, several recent studies have revealed that regions homologous to the MA stretch of the Torpedo nACh receptor are additional determinants of \u2425 in 5-HT 3 , nACh \u24234\u24242, and \u24231 glycine receptors (16 -19) (reviewed in Ref. 1). In the case of the 5-HT 3 A receptor, this region also contributes to diversus monovalent cation selectivity but not charge selectivity (20). The 4 \u00c5 resolution structure of the Torpedo nACh receptor obtained by cryo-EM and image reconstruction (8,9) reveals that the MA stretch, with a contribution from the TM1-TM2 linker, frames intracellular fenestrations through which ions must flow to enter or exit the cytoplasmic vestibule of the channel, providing a structural basis for such observations.",

Indeed, the cryo-EM images of the Torpedo nACh receptor depict an electronegative vestibule of \u03f360 \u00c5 in length and maximally 20 \u00c5 in width that has been predicted to strongly influence cation conduction (9). Using a homology model of the closed state of the adult muscle nACh receptor ((\u24231) 2 \u24241\u2425\u2440), based upon the cryo-EM images of the Torpedo nACh receptor (9), Wang et al. (22) conducted in silico molecular dynamics simulations of the transition of Na \u03e9 ions through the conduction pathway over a time frame of 16 ns. The simulation revealed the stabilization of cations at a number of positions along the channel axis. Notably, the extracellular vestibule was highlighted to present negative charges corresponding to the \u24231 subunit residues Glu 83 and Asp 97 , where cations appeared to reside before further translocation to the transmembrane portion of the channel. Numerous additional computational approaches applied to homology models of the nACh receptor indicate that the ECD acts to concentrate monovalent cations over anions (e.g. see Refs. 23 and 24). By contrast, a homology model of the GABA A receptor indicates the ECD to concentrate anions in preference to cations (25).",

The analyses were performed in the background of a high \u2425 mutant of the human 5-HT 3 A receptor (5-HT 3 A(QDA)), because the wild-type 5-HT 3 A receptor has a \u2425 value too small to quantify by conventional single channel recording techniques (1,16,27). The mutations introduced into the large intracellular loop of the human 5-HT 3 A receptor to generate the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) receptor construct are R432Q, R436D, and R440A (16). We demonstrate that the extracellular channel vestibule within this model cationic pLGIC strongly influences \u2425 and is also an important determinant of relative permeability to Ca 2\u03e9 and the modulation of \u2425 by extracellular Ca 2\u03e9 .

Patch electrodes for both modes were filled with a solution comprising 140 mM CsCl, 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 1.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted with 1 M CsOH; final [Cs \u03e9 ] o \u03ed 143 mM). The intracellular free calcium concentration of this solution was estimated to be 10 nM (29). The recording chamber comprised a 35-mm Petri dish on which the cells were cultivated. Using a gravity-feed system, the chamber was superfused routinely at \u03f35 ml/min, at room temperature (20 -23\u00b0C), with extracellular solutions of the compositions described below. Single channel currents evoked by pressure-applied 5-HT (10 M) were recorded in an extracellular solution (E1) consisting of 142.8 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted by 1 M NaOH; final [Na \u03e9 ] o \u03ed 146 mM). Whole-cell recording was used to determine the reversal potentials (E 5-HT ) of macroscopic currents elicited by 5-HT (10 M) by means of a voltageramp protocol using WinWCP V3 9.6 electrophysiology software (J. Dempster, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Strathclyde, UK; available on the World Wide Web). Unless stated otherwise, E 5-HT was determined via a protocol wherein the membrane potential was initially set at \u03ea60 mV, and a macroscopic current response to 5-HT was elicited. During the plateau of the current response, the membrane potential was stepped from \u03ea60 to \u03ea100 mV for 100 ms and subsequently ramped to \u03e980 mV within 1 s. Care was taken to ensure that the current amplitude at the beginning and termination of the voltage ramp protocol were similar. An identical voltage ramp in the absence of 5-HT served to determine the leakage current and was subtracted from the currents evoked in the presence of 5-HT to generate the current-voltage (I-V) relationship specifically attributable to the 5-HT-evoked conductance. E 5-HT was determined from such leak-subtracted currents. In order to determine the permeability of Na \u03e9 relative to Cs \u03e9 (P Na /P Cs ), E 5-HT was determined in solution E1, and the permeability ratio was calculated from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) (voltage) equation,",

For the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) receptor construct, the single channel current i-V relationship is linear at negative potentials with a slope \u2425 of 41 pS (20). However, at positive potentials, \u2425 increases to 46 pS, indicative of modest outward rectification quantified as an RI value (see \"Experimental Procedures\") of 1.12 (20)  (Fig. 2B). Under identical ionic conditions, the i-V relationships obtained for the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D113N and the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D113K receptor constructs reveal that both mutations enhance outward rectification, the RI values being 1.7 and 2.63, respectively (Table 1). Notably, either mutation reduced only inwardly (and not outwardly) directed single channel currents (Fig. 2B). Such results are consistent with a scheme whereby the ring of negativity formed by the Asp 113 residues acts via simple coulombic attraction to raise the availability of cations within the receptor extracellular vestibule for translocation to deeper regions of the pore. Neutralization or reversal of charge at this locus would be anticipated to reduce the local concentration of cations within the extracellular vestibule, leading to the emergence of outward rectification. Notably, the effect of neutralizing or reversing the charge at the Asp 113 position was increased when [Na \u03e9 ] o was reduced to 95 mM (see below) (see Fig. 5). In comparison with the 46 and 58% reductions in \u2425 found for the D113N and D113K mutations, respectively, with [Na \u03e9 ] o set at 146 mM, the corresponding reductions in the Na \u03e9 -deficient solution were 66 and 72%. The enhanced effect of the mutations at the lower ionic strength is once more consistent with a predominantly electrostatic influence of the Asp 113 residue. This is due to the screening effect of oppositely charged ions upon amino acid residues that have fixed charges that would reduce the influence of the Asp 113 residue at high ionic strength.",

            "text": "Asp 127 Is a Major Determinant of \u2425 and Influences Single Channel Current Rectification-Asp 127 is predicted from a homology model of the human 5-HT 3 A receptor (18) to reside approximately two-thirds of the distance from the entrance to the extracellular vestibule to the extracellular border of TM2 (i.e. the 20\u0408 residue) and occupies a locus homologous to that of the Asp 97 residue of the Torpedo nACh receptor \u24231 subunit (Fig. 1). Application of 5-HT (10 M) to outside-out patches expressing the human 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D127N receptor construct yielded relatively small, yet clearly resolvable, single channel currents at a holding potential of \u03ea80 mV, yielding a chord \u2425 of 7.3 \u03ee 0.1 pS (Fig. 3, A and B, and Table 1). Neutralization of the negative charge of the 127 residues thus reduces \u2425 by 82% in comparison with the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) receptor. Consistent with a contribution of an electrostatic influence upon inwardly directed cation flux, the D127N mutation within the 5-HT3A(QDA) construct confers a strong outwardly rectifying (RI \u03ed 3.18) i-V profile, as determined from single channel currents recorded between the holding potentials of \u03ea100 and  \u03e9100 mV at 20-mV increments (Fig. 3B). However, unlike mutations at the 113 locus, the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D127N receptor mediated outwardly directed single channel currents that were clearly depressed in comparison with the 5-HT3A(QDA) construct ( Fig. 3B). In addition, the effect of the D127N mutation was not enhanced when [Na \u03e9 ] o was reduced to 95 mM. It is likely that the role of Asp 127 extends beyond that of locally concentrating cations within the extracellular vestibule. In contrast to the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D127N receptor, individual single channel events in response to 5-HT (10 M) were not discernible when recording at a holding potential of \u03ea80 mV from membrane patches expressing the 5-HT3A(QDA) D127K construct (Fig. 3A). Instead, a noisy \"macroscopic-like\" inward current evoked by 5-HT was observed, which is reminiscent of that previously reported for the human wild-type 5-HT 3 A receptor in a similar experimental paradigm (31). To estimate the \u2425 value of the channels underlying such currents, we employed fluctuation analysis of 5-HT-evoked macroscopic currents from whole cells voltage-clamped at a holding poten-tial of \u03ea80 mV, as described previously (16,27). Such an analysis yielded a \u2425 of 1.65 \u03ee 0.3 pS (Table 1). Outwardly directed single channel events mediated by the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D127K receptor construct in outside-out patches at holding potentials as positive as \u03e980 mV were also unmeasurable by direct observation (data not shown). We were unable to obtain an estimate of \u2425 by fluctuation analysis of whole-cell currents at such positive potentials due to a poor signal/noise ratio. Thus, the 127 locus appears to be a major determinant of both inward and outward conduction of cations.",

In such experiments, Na \u03e9 replaced Cs \u03e9 as the permeant monovalent cation that dialyzed the cell interior. A whole-cell voltage ramp protocol (see \"Experimental Procedures\") was employed to obtain E 5-HT values for the extracellular domain mutants in the presence of variable [Na \u03e9 ] o (146, 95, and 20 mM; solutions E1, E3, and E6, respectively), where Na \u03e9 was replaced with sucrose to maintain osmolarity. Plots of E 5-HT versus the logarithm of extracellular Na \u03e9 activity ((Na \u03e9 ) o ) were generated to examine the cation versus anion selectivity of each of the extracellular domain mutants. No appreciable perturbation of charge selectivity was observed in comparison with the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) receptor (slope of 59 mV/decade change in (Na \u03e9 ) o (20)) because the slopes were found to be 55.6, 59.5, 57.4, and 57.5 mV/decade change in (Na \u03e9 ) o for the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D113N, 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D113K, 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D127N, and 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D127K receptors, respectively (data not shown). The GHK voltage equation predicts a slope of 58 mV/decade change in (Na \u03e9 ) o (at room temperature) for a channel that is perfectly selective for monovalent cations. P Na /P Cs determined similarly was generally unaffected at 5-HT3A(QDA) constructs carrying mutations to the Asp 113 and Asp 127 residues, although the 5-HT3A(QDA) D113N (0.78 \u03ee 0.02) and 5-HT3A(QDA) D127K (1.02 \u03ee 0.03) constructs exhibited modestly shifted, but significantly different, ratios compared with the 5-HT3A(QDA) construct (0.87 \u03ee 0.03).

In brief, E 5-HT for the 5-HT3A(QDA) D127N construct was determined by ramping the membrane potential over a period of 1 s from \u03e940 to \u03ea100 mV and returning to \u03e940 mV during the peak of a macroscopic current evoked by 5-HT (10 M).

For the 5-HT3A(QDA) D127K mutant, a similar voltage ramp protocol, but spanning the potential range \u03e940 to \u03ea150 mV, yielded leak-subtracted whole-cell currents with an E 5-HT value (\u03ea74.6 \u03ee 5.4 mV) markedly negative to that of both the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) and 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D127N receptor constructs (Fig. 4E).

For the 5-HT3A(QDA) construct, such suppression is concentration-dependent over the range 0.1-30 mM and voltage-independent over the range 0.3-10 mM in the presence of a [Na \u03e9 ] o fixed at 95 mM (20). The predominant suppression of \u2425 by [Ca 2\u03e9 ] o is chiefly observed over the concentration range 0.1-10 mM (extracellular solutions E3, E4, and E5; see Fig. 5). In view of the pronounced influence of the extracellular vestibule mutants upon the P Ca /P Cs ratio of the 5-HT3A(QDA) construct, the effect of extracellular Ca 2\u03e9 on the \u2425 of the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) receptor mutated at either the Asp 113   Relative permeabilities (i.e. P Ca /P Cs and P Na /P Cs ) were determined from measurements of E 5-HT in extracellular solutions containing Na \u03e9 (solution E1) or Ca 2\u03e9 (solution E2) as the permeant cation.  Note that all mutations cause a negative shift in E 5-HT that is indicative of a reduced P Ca /P Cs ratio. Paralleling the latter is an enhancement of outward rectification of the macroscopic currents due to a progressively diminished ability to conduct Ca 2\u03e9 inwardly. ] o from 0.1 to 10 mM had no significant effect upon \u2425, which was 13.9 \u03ee 1.0 and 11.4 \u03ee 0.7 pS, respectively (Fig. 5B). Reversal of charge at the Asp 113 locus by substituting lysine resulted in a channel that similarly displayed only a marginal, although significant, suppression of \u2425 over the 100-fold increase in [Ca 2\u03e9 ] o (i.e. 11.5 \u03ee 0.3 to 9.8 \u03ee 0.3 pS) (Fig. 5B). The single channel current amplitudes observed for the 5-HT3A(QDA) D127N mutant in extracellular solutions composed of Na \u03e9 /Ca 2\u03e9 mixtures displayed a low signal/noise ratio, and thus the sensitivity of \u2425 to increased [Ca 2\u03e9 ] o cannot be evaluated with precision. Despite this, an elevation of extracellular [Ca 2\u03e9 ] o from 0.1 mM (\u2425 \u03ed 6.6 \u03ee 0.4 pS) to 10 mM (\u2425 \u03ed 4.6 \u03ee 0.5 pS) appeared to have no significant effect upon \u2425 (Fig.  5). The 5-HT 3 A(QDA) D127K receptor construct was not investigated due to its very low \u2425. Collectively, mutation of Asp 113 to asparagine and lysine and Asp 127 to asparagine markedly suppresses the sensitivity of \u2425 to [Ca 2\u03e9 ] o that is a characteristic of the both the wild-type human 5-HT 3 A receptor (27) and the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) receptor construct (20).",

First, the i-V data obtained with both the D113N and D113K constructs show that the mutations exclusively depress inwardly directed single channels in comparison with the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) receptor, introducing outward rectification to the i-V relationship. The degree of rectification increased as the charge at the 113 locus was neutralized (5-HT3A(QDA) D113N, RI \u03ed 1.70) or reversed (5-HT3A(QDA) D113K, RI \u03ed 2.63). Such an effect is consistent with Asp 113 acting to increase the local concentration of cations within the outer extracellular vestibule, facilitating their onward translocation to deeper regions of the pore. Simple electrostatic interactions are sensitive to ionic strength, due to the screening of fixed charges by counterions (32). Although we did not examine the influence of ionic strength in a systematic manner (as elegantly performed by Kienker et al. (32) for the skeletal muscle nACh receptor harboring mutations in the extracellular (20\u0408) and cytoplasmic (\u03ea4\u0408) rings), we note parenthetically that the percentage depression of \u2425 caused by the D113N and D113K mutations was more pronounced when [Na \u03e9 ] o was reduced from 146 to 95 mM. Attempts to evaluate the influence of lower concentrations of [Na \u03e9 ] o were unsuccessful due to reductions in \u2425 that rendered quantification unreliable.",

Although inwardly directed single channel currents were reduced to a greater extent than outwardly directed events by the D127N mutation (RI \u03ed 3.18), suppression of \u2425 was apparent over a wide range of potentials (\u03ea100 to \u03e9100 mV). Unlike the D113 mutant, the percentage reduction of the amplitude of inwardly directed currents was not increased at reduced ionic strength, at least not within the limits examined. Strikingly, the D127K mutation reduced \u2425 to a value that could not be determined directly at both negative and positive holding potentials. That the effect of mutations at the 127 locus upon inward currents is more pronounced than at the 113 position is not surprising because the former ring of charge is positioned closer to the entrance of the transmembrane region of the pore (Fig. 1). Furthermore, it is likely that the position of the 127 residue at the tip of the \u24244/5 loop (26,33) causes it to protrude into the vestibule, forming a ring of charge that may be narrower than that present at the 113 locus. Indeed, this appears to be the case for the aligned region of the Torpedo nACh receptor (9). However, we refrain from attempting to specify the diameters of the forgoing rings because our homology model (Fig. 1) is based on the pseudosymmetrical structure of the Torpedo nACh receptor and probably does not reflect with sufficient accuracy the fine structure of the homo-oligomeric 5-HT 3 A receptor.",

Interestingly, Hansen et al. (26) demonstrated that suppression of \u2425 in the adult human muscle nACh receptor is a non-linear function of the net charge upon the Asp 97 ring and that two sets of mutations that resulted in the same change in net charge (i.e. the introduction of three lysine and two alanine residues versus the insertion of four lysine and retention of one aspartate residue) had significantly different effects upon \u2425. Thus, the side chain substitutions and their locations within the mutant subunits of the nACh receptor are at least as important as the net charge on the ring (26). In the present study, we observed the suppression of outwardly directed single channel currents by the D127N mutation, which would not be anticipated if the Asp 127 residue served only to elevate the concentration of permeant cations within the extracellular vestibule. The molecular dynamics simulations performed by Wang et al. (22) upon the adult muscle nACh receptor reveal that cations are stabilized by the homologous Asp 97 residue within the adult muscle nACh receptor. Such stabilization indicates the presence of an energy well that would be anticipated to affect both inward and outward ionic movements. Energy wells within the extracellular vestibule are also apparent as negative vestibular pore potentials computed for the Torpedo nACh receptor (23,24). We speculate that the decrease or possibly reversal in pore potential caused by the D127N and D127K mutations, respectively, removes a force that facilitates both inwardly and outwardly directed ion fluxes or introduces a barrier against such movements.",

Such results are not surprising. First, it has been shown that mutating the inner (\u03ea1\u0408) ring of charge of the mouse 5-HT 3 A receptor from glutamate to alanine renders the channel essentially non-selective between cations and anions (P Na /P Cl \u03ed 0.89) (34). When combined with the 19\u0408 mutation Ser 3 Arg, the channel gained modest anion selectivity (P Na /P Cl \u03ed 0.37) (34). Second, extracellularly applied anionic methanethiosulfonate reagents react with cysteine residues engineered into the mouse 5-HT 3 A receptor at multiple locations within the TM2 domain, demonstrating that anions can penetrate the extracellular vestibule (35,36). Finally, Brownian dynamics simulations conducted upon the Torpedo nACh receptor indicate that although the extracellular vestibule contains a much higher concentration of Na \u03e9 than Cl \u03ea , the latter is not excluded (24).",

For the D113N, D113K, D127N, and D127K mutations, P Ca /P Cs ratios were calculated to be 1.04, 0.60, 0.13, and 0.06, respectively. It is notable that the decreases in P Ca /P Cs parallel the decrements in \u2425 caused by such mutations. At each locus, the suppression of P Ca /P Cs increased as the negative charge was neutralized or reversed, consistent with a simple through-space electrostatic effect. We attribute the greater influence of the Asp 127 residue, in common with its effect upon \u2425, as probably being due to its deeper location within the pore of the extracellular vestibule and inclusion within a narrower ring of charge. Permeant ion species would thus be concentrated in proximity to the entrance of the transmembrane pore.",

Similarly, reductions in the negative charge at the \u03ea1\u0408 locus of the \u24234\u24242 and \u24233\u24244 nACh receptors greatly reduces P Ca /P Na (37). Placing the present data in context, the D127K and D127N mutations produced effects upon relative permeability to Ca 2\u03e9 of a magnitude comparable with or greater than those reported in the above studies. Asp 127 appears to be a residue that is critical for the translocation of Ca 2\u03e9 into the transmembrane pore of the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) receptor construct. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to identify residues within the N-terminal outer vestibule of a pLGIC that influence valence selectivity. Moreover, the data add to those of our previous report illustrating relative permeability to Ca 2\u03e9 in the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) receptor to be influenced at multiple sites that include the extracellular (20\u0408) ring of charge and residues within the intracellular MA stretch (i.e. Arg 436 ) (20). Others (34) have inferred a role for the \u03ea1\u0408 (inner ring) in Ca 2\u03e9 permeation based on Ca 2\u03e9 imaging assays conducted upon the mouse wild-type 5-HT 3 A receptor. Collectively, the data are consistent with a processional movement of Ca 2\u03e9 from the extracellular to the intracellular environment, where multiple negatively charged residues along the axis of the permeation pathway facilitate the inward translocation of the ion. It should be noted that the occurrence of positive charge (i.e. lysine) at a position most likely homologous to Asp 127 does not prevent permeability to Ca 2\u03e9 in \u24231 glycine receptors mutated within TM2 and flanking sequences to impart cation selectivity (38).",

(22) indicate that monovalent cations are stabilized at residues homologous to Asp 113 and Asp 127 in the adult muscle nACh receptor. From simple considerations of coulombic attraction, an even greater degree of stabilization of Ca 2\u03e9 would be anticipated. The outer vestibule is sufficiently wide (9) to accommodate multiple Ca 2\u03e9 ions, which, stabilized therein, would exert a repulsive force upon monovalent cations moving either inwardly or outwardly, thereby depressing \u2425. The loca-tion of the Asp 113 and Asp 127 residues outside of the transmembrane voltage field is consistent with the voltage-independent nature of the block by extracellular Ca 2\u03e9 (20). We envisage that mutations that neutralize or reverse charge at the 113 and 127 loci reduce the stabilization of Ca 2\u03e9 within the vestibule and thus alleviate block by extracellular Ca 2\u03e9 . It is notable that mutations at either location appear sufficient to reduce the influence of Ca 2\u03e9 upon \u2425. It is possible that the primary site at which Ca 2\u03e9 is stabilized is the Asp 127 position, with the Asp 113 residue acting to facilitate the translocation of the divalent to the former site. Such an effect would be consistent with the observation that mutations at the 113 position have a more modest effect on P Ca /P Cs than those at the 127 locus, which in the case of the D127K substitution renders the channel virtually impermeable to Ca 2\u03e9 . However, it is evident that for either mutation, the data show a tendency to a residual suppression of \u2425 by Ca 2\u03e9 , perhaps suggesting additional site(s) of action within the conduction pathway. We have previously excluded the extracellular (20\u0408) ring of charge as such a candidate (20).",

The results herein indicate that the extracellular vestibule of the 5-HT 3 A(QDA) receptor contains at least two rings of negative charge that strongly impact upon \u2425 and P Ca /P Cs and suppression of \u2425 by extracellular Ca 2\u03e9 . By inference, homologous residues in other subunits within the pLGIC family might be anticipated to have similar functions, with the caveat that such extrapolation is from a receptor construct already modified by mutations within the large intracellular loop. In particular, virtually all cation-selective eukaryotic pLGICs contain aspartate at a position equivalent to the 127 locus (exceptions are the nACh \u24233 and \u24236 subunits), whereas the aligned residue or an adjacent residue in the anion-selective members is lysine (3). Thus, the sign of the residue at this position is appropriate to the charge selectivity of the pLGIC and indeed the simultaneous mutation of Lys 104 and Gly 105 to alanine and aspartate (the aligned residues in the nACh \u24231 subunit) in the \u24231 glycine receptor has very recently been shown to depress \u2425 (39). By contrast, the residue aligned to the 113 locus in cation-selective pLGICs is poorly conserved and presents as either a neutral, polar, acidic, or basic, but not hydrophobic, residue, suggesting that the importance of this position may vary across the receptor family. It is probable that other residues within the ECD influence receptor biophysics, a prominent candidate being \u24231 Asn 47 of the nACh receptor of adult skeletal muscle highlighted in the molecular dynamics simulations of Wang et al. (22). In addition, it has already been mentioned by Bernal et al. (40) that mutation of the bovine nACh \u24237 Lys 145 residue (aligned with 5-HT3A(QDA) Val 154 ) to alanine is associated with a modest but significant increase in \u2425. Moreover, it has recently been reported that the dual mutation D57I and R59T within the \u24231 glycine receptor significantly reduces \u2425 (39). In aggregate, it is now evident, for both cation-and anion-selective pLGICs, that to fully account for the biophysical properties of ion permeation, amino acids residing within the TM2/TM1-TM2 linker region, the cytoplasmic portals, and the extracellular vestibule must be considered collectively.",
