            "text": "Background: The development of rapid and safe antidepressants for the treatment of major depression is in urgent demand. Converging evidence suggests that glutamatergic signaling seems to play important roles in the pathophysiology of depression. Methods: We studied the antidepressant effects of 3 '-deoxyadenosine (3'-dA, Cordycepin) and the critical role of the \u03b1-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor in male CD-1 mice via behavioral and biochemical experiments. After 3'-dA treatment, the phosphorylation and synaptic localization of the AMPA receptors GluR1 and GluR2 were determined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP). The traditional antidepressant imipramine was applied as a positive control. Results: We found that an injection of 3'-dA led to a rapid and robust antidepressant effect, which was significantly faster and stronger than imipramine, after 45 min in tail suspension and forced swim tests. This antidepressant effect remained after 5 days of treatment with 3'-dA. Unlike the psycho-stimulants, 3'-dA did not show a hyperactive effect in the open field test. After 45 min or 5 days of treatment, 3'-dA enhanced GluR1 S845 phosphorylation in both the PFC and HIP. In addition, after 45 min of treatment, 3'-dA significantly up-regulated GluR1 S845 phosphorylation and GluR1, but not GluR2 levels, at the synapses in the PFC. After 5 days of treatment, 3'-dA significantly enhanced GluR1 S845 phosphorylation and GluR1, but not GluR2, at the synapses in the PFC and HIP. Moreover, the AMPA-specific antagonist GYKI 52466 was able to block the rapid antidepressant effects of 3'-dA.",

            "text": "Due to the millions of individuals who suffer from major depression today, and the delayed efficacy of the existing therapeutic agents, there exists an interest in finding a safer compound with robust and rapid antidepressant effects (Krystal et al., 2013;Caddy et al., 2014). The most famous rapid antidepressant, Ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was found to rely on increasing \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) signaling to exert its antidepressant efficacy (Maeng et al., 2008). A previous study has shown that a traditional Chinese medicine, Cordyceps Militaris powder, demonstrated an antidepressant effect in the tail suspension test (TST;Nishizawa et al., 2007). Moreover, 3'-deoxyadenosine (3'-dA, Cordycepin), one of the major bioactive metabolites in the Cordyceps Militaris (Tuli et al., 2013), exerted a beneficial effect in a 6-week chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model via the forced swim test (FST; Tianzhu et al., 2014). 3'-dA possesses a wide range of beneficial effects of therapeutic potential, including anti-insomnia, antiinflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-viral, and anti-fungal activities (Hu et al., 2013;Tuli et al., 2013). However, whether or not 3'-dA has a fast-acting antidepressant effect remains unknown.",

            "text": "Glutamate mediates the vast majority of excitatory transmissions and about 80% of neurons form 85% of the synapses, which are spiny and excitatory in the central nervous system (CNS; Douglas and Martin, 2007;Sanacora et al., 2012). A growing body of evidence suggests that the glutamatergic system might be very important in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression (Krystal et al., 2002;Sanacora et al., 2012;Musazzi et al., 2013;Pilc et al., 2013). The AMPA receptor channel is a tetramer assembled from the four subunits, including GluR1, GluR2, GluR3, and GluR4. Clinical evidence has shown that the expression of AMPA receptors, particularly GluR1, is decreased in the brains of patients with depression (Beneyto et al., 2007;Duric et al., 2013). Additionally, the trafficking of AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 and synaptic plasticity are regulated by the phosphorylation of specific subunits (Malinow and Malenka, 2002;Esteban et al., 2003). Phosphorylation of GluR1 at serine 845 (S845) was increased following antidepressant treatment with flouxetine or tianeptine in mice (Svenningsson et al., 2002(Svenningsson et al., , 2007, suggesting that phosphorylation of GluR1 might be associated with the potentiation of AMPA receptor currents (Wang et al., 2005). Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of GluR1 at S845 and GluR1 synaptic localization might be common mechanisms for the agents with antidepressant efficacy, such as imipramine, lamotrigine, and riluzol (Du et al., 2007;Gould et al., 2008). However, whether 3'-dA regulates AMPA synaptic plasticity is still unknown.",

Western blot analysis of Phos-GluR1 S845, GluR1, and GluR2 were performed with the synaptic fractions. Here, we found that levels of GluR1 and GluR2 were significantly enriched at the synapses, compared with the total protein ( Figure 4A). After 45 minutes of treatment with the high dose of 3'-dA (12.5 mg/kg), Phos-GluR1 S845 and GluR1 levels, but not GluR2 levels, were significantly increased in the synaptosomal fractions in the PFC ( Figures 4B and C and 5A). It is noteworthy that the acute treatment of the traditional antidepressant imipramine did not lead to a significant increase in GluR1 levels at the synapses ( Figure 4C), which is consistent with the results in the TST and FST after 45 minutes of treatment ( Figure 1A and B).",

However, ketamine does not present ideal features as an antidepressant because of its potential psychotomimetic effects and abuse. The underlying antidepressant mechanism of ketamine has been well studied, and emerging evidence shows that ketamine's antidepressant properties rely on blocking NMDA receptors, increasing AMPA signaling, and rapidly inducing synaptogenesis (Maeng et al., 2008;Caddy et al., 2014). The antidepressant effect of ketamine appears to be fast-acting and lasts for a few days to weeks (Aan Het Rot et al., 2012). Some clinical evidence indicates that depressed patients might have side effects of a fast heart rate, high blood pressure, respiratory depression, and hallucinations after treatment with ketamine (Bowdle et al., 1998;Roback et al., 2006;Paul et al., 2009;Aan Het Rot et al., 2010). Other psycho-stimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamine, may also have rapid antidepressant effects: however, these psycho-stimulants usually induce excitatory neural toxicity and drug addiction (Pierce and Kalivas, 1997;McCance-Katz et al., 1998). Moreover, most psycho-stimulants also lead to the development of depressive symptoms during withdrawal (Che et al., 2013;Krzascik et al., 2015).",

            "text": "3'-dA is an analogue of adenosine, which is a neurotransmitter in the nervous system (Haas and Selbach, 2000). It has been shown that adenosine-derived drugs can be transported from blood to the brain via an adenosine transporter across the blood-brain barrier (Li et al., 2001;Pardridge, 2012). Very recently, it has been shown that 3'-dA has a beneficial effect in CUMSinduced behavioral deficits after treatment with doses of 20 mg/ kg and 40 mg/kg for 3-6 weeks (Tianzhu et al., 2014). Chronic 3'-dA (20, 40 mg/kg) treatments reversed the behavioral deficiency induced by CUMS exposure in the TST and FST (Tianzhu et al., 2014). Here, we report a rapid and robust antidepressant effect of 3'-dA alone within a lower dose range (5-12.5 mg/kg). In our study, the 3'-dA resulted in approximately a 45% reduction in immobility time within 45 minutes in both the TST and FST, which is significantly stronger and faster than the traditional antidepressant imipramine ( Figure 1A and B). The imipramine dose range commonly used for mouse models of depression is 10-20 mg/kg/day (Solomon et al., 2014;Ichikawa et al., 2015). We chose the middle of this range, 15 mg/kg, to compare with the similar dose of 3'-dA (12.5 mg/kg) and found that after 45 min of treatment, the imipramine (15 mg/kg) did not reach significant antidepressant effects, but 3'-dA demonstrated faster antidepressant effects (Figure 1A and B). It is noteworthy that recently evidence has shown that i.p. injection with a low dose of imipramine (<20 mg/kg) did not lead to fast antidepressant effects in 30 minutes, but a dose of 30 or 40 mg/kg decreased the immobility time in mice in the TST and FST (Villard et al., 2011;Cai et al., 2013;Nguyen and Matsumoto, 2015). Therefore, we only concluded that compared to the imipramine dose of 15 mg/kg, 3'-dA (12.5 mg/kg) demonstrated faster and stronger antidepressant effects ( Figure 1A and B). Although 3'-dA demonstrated rapid and strong antidepressant effects, it did not elicit hyperactivity like some of the psycho-stimulants (Figure 2A and B).",

            "text": "A growing body of data suggests that AMPA receptor signaling plays a critical role in regulating synaptic strength, as well as various forms of neural and behavioral plasticity (Carlezon and Nestler, 2002;Malenka, 2003;Kendell et al., 2005;Rumpel et al., 2005;Sun et al., 2005). 3'-dA is an agonist for the adenosine A3 receptor (Kitamura et al., 2011;Nakamura et al., 2015), which regulates synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation in vivo and in vitro (Costenla et al., 2001;Maggi et al., 2009). Therefore, we hypothesized that 3'-dA may mediate through the adenosine A3 receptor to regulate the AMPA receptor function, which we will explore in our future research. GluR1 phosphorylation at the S845 site, which is a PKA site, is often viewed as an indicator for GluR1 membrane insertion in neurons and wide channel openings (Roche et al., 1996;Banke et al., 2000;Lee et al., 2000;Esteban et al., 2003). A previous study has shown that the levels of GluR1 in the PFCs of depressed patients were decreased (Beneyto et al., 2007), which was consistent with the animal experiments (Toth et al., 2008;Yuen et al., 2012;Kallarackal et al., 2013). The AMPA receptor may serve as a common mechanism for the treatment of mood disorders, since the two anticonvulsants riluzole (with a predominantly antidepressant profile) and lamotrigine enhanced GluR1 phosphorylation at the S845 site. In contrast, the anticonvulsant valproate (with a predominantly antimanic profile) exerted the opposite effect on GluR1 phosphorylation at the S845 site (Du et al., 2004a(Du et al., , 2007(Du et al., , 2008(Du et al., , 2010Gould et al., 2008). Consistent with previous findings, we found that 3'-dA was able to enhance GluR1 S845 phosphorylation and GluR1 synaptic localization in the PFC within 45 minutes ( Figures 3A and 4B and  C), which is faster than the traditional antidepressant imipramine. After 5 days of treatment, both 3'-dA and imipramine were able to enhance the phosphorylation of GluR1 S845 and synaptic GluR1 significantly in the PFC and HIP ( Figures 3C and 4D and E).",

CD-1 mice were i.p. injected with AMPA-specific antagonist GYKI 52466 (30 mg/kg) or vehicle.

The number of mice per group is indicated in each individual graph. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and presented as mean \u00b1 standard error (post hoc Tukey test, \u2605p < 0.05, \u2605\u2605p < 0.01, \u2605\u2605\u2605p < 0.001).

It has been reported that a traditional antidepressant regulated the GluR1/2 tetramers in the PFC (Ampuero et al., 2010). We also found that the chronic treatment of imipramine enhanced GluR1/2 levels at the synapses ( Figure 4E), suggesting that imipramine regulates GluR1/2 tetramers of AMPA receptors, which is consistent with previous studies (Du et al., 2004a(Du et al., , 2004b(Du et al., , 2007(Du et al., , 2008. However, it has been shown that drugs mediating the fast-acting antidepressant mechanisms, like cocaine, regulate the GluR1/3, instead of GluR1/2, in the PFC (Blanco et al., 2012(Blanco et al., , 2014. 3'-dA did not increase GluR2 levels at the synapses, suggesting that this regulation of increased AMPA synaptic transmission may be mediated through a subtype-specific manner and that other subtypes of AMPA tetramers, such as GluR1/3, might be involved. This is consistent with its fastacting antidepressant effect.",

Clinical evidence has demonstrated that neuronal activity in the PFC is reduced in depressed patients, and could be restored by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (Kennedy et al., 2001;Fales et al., 2009). In rodent models, chronic stress decreased the expression levels of AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and various synaptic proteins, induced the atrophy of distal dendrites of pyramidal cells, and damaged the dendritic spines in the PFC (Liston et al., 2006;Radley et al., 2008;Li et al., 2011). In addition, a recent study showed that the expression levels of GluR1 were decreased in rat PFCs, but not in HIPs after 7 days of chronic restraint stress, suggesting that the PFC is more susceptible to stress (Yuen et al., 2012). In this paper, we found that within 45 min, 3'-dA enhanced GluR1 synaptic localization in the PFC ( Figure 4B).",

Other beneficial effects of 3'-dA, such as the anti-viral and anti-fungal effects, may also provide additional benefits to depressed patients, because viral or fungal infections contribute to or even cause depressive symptoms (Tuli et al., 2013). 3'-dA also improves the quality of sleep by increasing non-rapid eye movement sleep (Hu et al., 2013). Therefore, 3'-dA is considered relatively safe and beneficial for use as a potential novel antidepressant drug.
