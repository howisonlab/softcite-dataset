We aimed to evaluate current definitions of AKI (acute kidney injury network (AKIN) criteria) in a population of cirrhotic patients and correlate this with outcomes. Methods We prospectively identified patients with AKI and clinical, radiological or histological evidence of cirrhosis. We compared them with a control group with evidence of cirrhosis and no AKI. Results 162 cirrhotic patients were studied with a mean age of 56.8\u00b114 years. They were predominantly male (65.4%) with alcoholic liver disease (78.4%). 110 patients had AKI: 44 stage 1, 32 stage 2 and 34 stage 3. They were well matched in age, sex and liver disease severity with 52 cirrhotics without AKI. AKI was associated with increased mortality (31.8% vs 3.8%, p<0.001). Mortality increased with each AKI stage; 3.8% in cirrhotics without AKI, 13.5% stage 1, 37.8% stage 2 and 43.2% stage 3 (p<0.001 for trend). Worsening liver disease (Child-Pugh class) correlated with increased mortality: 3.1% class A, 23.6% class B and 32.8% class C (p=0.006 for trend). AKI was associated with increased length of stay: median 6.0 days (IQR 4.0-8.75) versus 16.0 days (IQR 6.0-27.5), p<0.001. Multivariate analysis identified AKI and Child-Pugh classes B and C as independent factors associated with mortality. Conclusions The utility of AKIN criteria is maintained in cirrhotic patients. Decompensated liver disease and AKI appear to be independent variables predicting death in cirrhotics."

            "text": "Mortality from liver disease is increasing. 1 Key drivers of this increase are the rising prevalence of alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis and fatty liver disease. 2 Liver disease is now the fifth highest cause of death in the UK, with a 25% increase in mortality between 2001 and 2009. 3 Renal dysfunction is a common complication of cirrhosis and confers a poor prognosis. 4 Renal dysfunction occurs in 20% of patients with cirrhosis admitted to hospital, often linked with other complications of cirrhosis such as variceal bleeding and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 5 In a systematic review of 118 studies, the presence of renal dysfunction was a powerful predictor of death in decompensated cirrhosis. 6 Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) has an extremely poor prognosis with a median survival time of 3 months, 7 falling to just 1 month in those with untreated Type 1 HRS. 8 Serum creatine is one of three variables comprising the model of end-stage liver disease score which is widely used in predicting short term mortality in allocating priority for orthotopic liver transplantation. 9 Many definitions of renal dysfunction in liver disease are based on creatine thresholds, such as those used in HRS classification. 10 This approach does not account for individual variation in baseline renal function or that a significant decline in renal function can occur with much smaller changes in creatine. There has also been a lack of standardisation in defining these thresholds. [10][11][12][13] A more evolved approach to defining acute renal dysfunction has come with the widespread acceptance of consensus criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI) that provide a method of diagnosing and describing the severity of renal dysfunction based on individualised changes in serum creatine and urine output. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) diagnostic criteria are the most current, 14 combining the earlier acute kidney injury network (AKIN) 15 and Risk of renal dysfunction; Injury to the kidney; Failure of kidney function; Loss of kidney function; and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) classifications. 16 The use of these criteria has been validated in a variety of settings including the critically ill and general hospitalised patients. [17][18][19][20][21] Importantly, these criteria recognise that even a small decline in renal function is associated with poor outcomes. 22 AKI therefore encompasses a wide spectrum of illness in a large number of patients from an abrupt rise in serum creatine of only 26.4 mmol/l (0.3 mg/dl) to critically unwell patients requiring renal replacement therapy.",

            "text": "However, there are several reasons why creatine-based definitions of AKI may perform differently in patients with liver disease. Cirrhotics are younger and have reduced muscle mass compared with other hospitalised patients. 23 Severe hyperbilirubinaemia gives a falsely low value of serum creatine with chemical rather than the enzymatic measurement techniques. 24 These factors may result in lower than expected baseline creatine values in this patient group relative to glomerular filtration rate. 25 A small number of studies have begun to evaluate the current AKI criteria in cirrhotics. Some have focused on specific groups, such as those in intensive care or decompensated patients with ascites, which may limit their generalisability. [26][27][28] The only prospective trial using robust AKIN definitions in a cirrhotic population was performed in four tertiary centres in the USA, but did not include a control group. 29 These data may differ from European experience with a low proportion of compensated cirrhosis (only 2% had Child-Pugh class A disease), high incidence of hepatitis C (44%) and high rates of inpatient dialysis (24%). We therefore sought to add to these studies by further evaluating the utility of current diagnostic criteria for AKI in patients with cirrhosis and examine their association with patient outcomes.",

Cirrhosis was diagnosed on the basis of any clinical (eg, decompensated chronic liver disease), radiological (eg, coarse liver, splenomegaly, presence of varices), or laboratory parameters (eg, prolonged international normalised ratio (INR) low platelets) and/or histological evidence from liver biopsy when available. 29 31 A control group of patients with cirrhosis without AKI were retrospectively identified from the admission register to the liver unit over the same time period.

Newer AKI criteria, such as the AKIN or KDIGO classifications, have several advantages. Small but significant changes in an individual's baseline creatine are included to improve sensitivity; these criteria also describe the severity of AKI depending on the magnitude of creatine rise (or degree of oliguria). These criteria are now widely accepted and have been validated in a variety of clinical scenarios, 14 but the differences in creatine profile seen in liver patients     Baseline creatine was robustly defined as the most recent stable measurement prior to admission for the index hospitalisation within 1 year or if they had at least 5 days of stable values within the normal creatine range following admission. Overall mortality was 26% and severity of AKI was independently associated with mortality (adjusted OR=3.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 11.1), but the presence of AKI itself was not assessed as there was no control group without AKI. Tsient et al 31 prospectively studied a total of 91 patients with cirrhosis and ascites recruited from hepatology outpatient clinics. Patients had bloods performed at 4-6 weekly intervals and AKI was defined by AKIN criteria if two samples within 48 h were available or if a 50% increase in serum creatine from the baseline visit was observed. If identified, AKI was treated with volume expansion of albumin (1 g/kg) for two consecutive days.

Although comparisons between studies are difficult, mortality rates in cirrhotics with AKI do appear to be higher than other reports of generalised hospital patients with AKI, suggesting that this patient group is particularly vulnerable when AKI develops. 17 30 For contextual reference, the overall mortality of general hospitalised patients with AKI at our centre from September 2010 to August 2012 was 21.2% (stage 1, 15.2%; stage 2, 32.3%; stage 3, 33.5%). Despite potential differences between the demographics of USA and European cirrhotics, we observed mortality rates similar to those reported by Belcher et al. 29 Although high (at over 30%), our observed mortality rates are lower than some historic studies. 26 27 This may reflect our inclusion of patients with less severe AKI, an effect of using current diagnostic criteria; mortality rose to above 40% in those with AKI stage 3. However, it is important to recognise that even small acute rises in serum creatine are significant, with mortality in our patients with AKI stage 1 substantially elevated as compared with controls. The implications of relatively small changes in serum creatine often remain underappreciated in clinical practice, which may be partly addressed by wider usage of current AKI definitions.",

In general patients, avoiding the use of results from the 7 days prior to hospital admission may avoid the use of falsely high reference creatine values, 34 but in cirrhotic patients it is conceivable that this period should be extended due to the indolent increase sometimes in serum creatine prior to the acute presentation.",

Carvalho et al 32 retrospectively studied 91 patients with cirrhosis and ascites identifying AKI within 48 h of hospital admission. The majority of patients had mild renal dysfunction (91% had stage 1 AKI). Patients with AKI had a hospital mortality rate of 52.7%. Presence of AKI conferred an OR of 2.6 for hospital mortality but quantifying the risk by stage was limited by the small numbers of patients with more severe AKI. Belcher et al 29 prospectively studied 192 hospitalised cirrhotic patients with AKI in four centres in the USA."
