The elderly are a subgroup known to be at high risk; they are under-represented in guidelinegenerating clinical trials, and real-world registries continue to demonstrate less use of cardiac medications and invasive care, even among those who are likely to derive benefit. 3 4 Within the whole spectrum of ACS,",

The methods used for each registry have been described previously. [9][10][11][12][13] Briefly, their primary objectives were to evaluate the characteristics, management and outcomes of consecutive patients with ACS admitted to Italian CCUs, using a catchment broad enough to provide data representative of the entire country. Participation in the study was offered to all institutions, including university teaching hospitals, general and regional hospitals, and private clinics with CCUs receiving patients with ACS.

These variables included gender, age, diabetes, history of heart failure, prior stroke/transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), peripheral vascular disease, prior renal failure, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, Killip class and atrial fibrillation at admission. This score, evaluated on the 2010 MANTRA population, was also used to standardise the death rates for each of the previous surveys.

In another registry that showed a significant increase in the use of guidelines-recommended treatments including PCI among more than 900 elderly patients admitted for MI between 2000 and 2006, a difference in mortality at 1 month was evident in case of STEMI, whereas there was only a non-significant trend towards reduction in mortality in patients with NSTEMI, despite a fourfold increase in the rate of invasive strategy during index admission. 20 Indeed, in the pivotal randomised clinical trials comparing an early invasive and an initially conservative treatment in NSTEACS, the clinical benefit in terms of death and/or MI after an invasive strategy in NSTEACS are usually observed after 6 months to 1 year of admission. 8 21 This is particularly evident in some patient populations with ACS, such as the elderly, in whom most deaths have a cardiac ischaemic origin, and the higher risk rises from 30 days to 1 year, especially after revascularisation. 22 Accordingly, the 5-year follow-up from the RITA-3 trial demonstrated that the benefit of invasive treatment over conservative care continued to widen after the first year, demonstrating the greatest benefits in those in high-risk quartiles, with age being the strongest predictor of risk. 23 ",

The short duration of follow-up (1 month) might have led to an underestimation of the benefits of implementation of care in terms of clinical events. In addition, the lack of central event adjudication might have amended the actual rate of adverse clinical outcomes. We did not record specific contraindications to any medication; in an elderly population, this may have influenced the rate of use of certain drugs, and may have been an unrecognised confounder, but we would not expect the prevalence of contraindications to specific therapies, particularly antithrombotic therapies, to change markedly with time.
