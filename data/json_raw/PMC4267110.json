The elderly are a subgroup known to be at high risk; they are under-represented in guidelinegenerating clinical trials, and real-world registries continue to demonstrate less use of cardiac medications and invasive care, even among those who are likely to derive benefit. 3 4 Within the whole spectrum of ACS,",

The methods used for each registry have been described previously. [9][10][11][12][13] Briefly, their primary objectives were to evaluate the characteristics, management and outcomes of consecutive patients with ACS admitted to Italian CCUs, using a catchment broad enough to provide data representative of the entire country. Participation in the study was offered to all institutions, including university teaching hospitals, general and regional hospitals, and private clinics with CCUs receiving patients with ACS.

However, the geographical distribution and the availability of facilities of CCUs participating in different registries may be considered representative of the entire country. The duration of the surveys, clinical end points and programmed follow-up visits were not homogeneous. The short duration of follow-up (1 month) might have led to an underestimation of the benefits of implementation of care in terms of clinical events. In addition, the lack of central event adjudication might have amended the actual rate of adverse clinical outcomes. We did not record specific contraindications to any medication; in an elderly population, this may have influenced the rate of use of certain drugs, and may have been an unrecognised confounder, but we would not expect the prevalence of contraindications to specific therapies, particularly antithrombotic therapies, to change markedly with time. In addition, we did not collect some variables such as frailty and functional status that are particularly important in elderly patients. Finally, analysing only patients admitted to CCUs may imply a selection bias.",
