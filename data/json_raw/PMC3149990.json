            "text": "Ion mobility (IM) is a method that measures the time taken for an ion to travel through a pressurized cell under the influence of a weak electric field. The speed by which the ions traverse the drift region depends on their size: large ions will experience a greater number of collisions with the background inert gas (usually N 2) and thus travel more slowly through the IM device than those ions that comprise a smaller cross-section. In general, the time it takes for the ions to migrate though the dense gas phase separates them, according to their collision cross-section (\u03a9). Recently, IM spectrometry was coupled with mass spectrometry and a traveling-wave (T-wave) Synapt ion mobility mass spectrometer (IM-MS) was released. Integrating mass spectrometry with ion mobility enables an extra dimension of sample separation and definition, yielding a three-dimensional spectrum (mass to charge, intensity, and drift time). This separation technique allows the spectral overlap to decrease, and enables resolution of heterogeneous complexes with very similar mass, or mass-to-charge ratios, but different drift times. Moreover, the drift time measurements provide an important layer of structural information, as \u03a9 is related to the overall shape and topology of the ion. The correlation between the measured drift time values and \u03a9 is calculated using a calibration curve generated from calibrant proteins with defined cross-sections 1. The power of the IM-MS approach lies in its ability to define the subunit packing and overall shape of protein assemblies at micromolar concentrations, and near-physiological conditions 1. Several recent IM studies of both individual proteins 2,3 and non-covalent protein complexes 4-9 , successfully demonstrated that protein quaternary structure is maintained in the gas phase, and highlighted the potential of this approach in the study of protein assemblies of unknown geometry. Here, we provide a detailed description of IMS-MS analysis of protein complexes using the Synapt (Quadrupole-Ion Mobility-Time-of-Flight) HDMS instrument (Waters Ltd; the only commercial IM-MS instrument currently available) 10. We describe the basic optimization steps, the calibration of collision cross-sections, and methods for data processing and interpretation. The final step of the protocol discusses methods for calculating theoretical \u03a9 values. Overall, the protocol does not attempt to cover every aspect of IM-MS characterization of protein assemblies; rather, its goal is to introduce the practical aspects of the method to new researchers in the field."

In addition, adjust the position of the capillary, with respect to the cone. 6. Adjust the MS acquisition parameters, to acquire a well-resolved MS spectrum: the pressure gradient along the instrument, and the sampling cone as well as the extraction cone, bias, Trap and Transfer potential settings, should all be optimized (detailed in the associated JoVE protocol Kirshenbaum et al. 2009 http://www.jove.com/index/details.stp?ID=1954). Although these parameters are sample-dependent, the conditions we used for acquiring MS spectra of various ion masses, from peptide to protein complexes, are outlined in Table 1, (see also Fig.  1). To minimize the activation of the complex try to gradually reduce (in steps of ~ 10 V) the sample cone, Trap and bias voltages without changing the position of the peak. 7. Once an optimum mass spectrum is obtained the drift time profile should be adjusted. When analyzing protein assemblies, optimal conditions for both mass and mobility measurements are often incompatible; therefore, it is important to strike the proper balance between the two. Overall, the ion mobility plot should be optimized such that the peaks are distributed over the entire drift time range, and the peak profile is smooth, approaching a Gaussian distribution ( Fig. 2A, 2B). Significant peak asymmetry can be related to poor separation of multiple conformations. 8. As a general rule, three parameters, T-wave velocity, T-wave height and IMS gas flow rate can be tuned to optimize the mobility separation.",

            "text": "Increasing the T-wave velocity will widen the drift time distribution profile, while increased T-wave height values will narrow it. Similarly, increasing the IMS gas flow will shift the drift time profile toward higher values (the minimal IMS gas flow should be 10 ml/min). We suggest leaving two of the three available variables fixed, and optimizing the third until the IM spectrum is well-resolved ( Fig. 2B). To this end, set the T-wave velocity and the gas flow to 250 m/s and 24 ml/min, respectively. Then, as a starting point, set the T-wave height to 3 V and, in a stepwise manner, increase it in 1 V increments. In general, larger ions will require higher wave heights. Usually, there is no need to modify the IMS pressure; however, when high bias voltages are required for tuning, reducing the IMS gas will enable a decrease in the bias voltage value and, consequently, a reduction in protein complex activation. Overall, maximal resolution of 10-12 t/\u0394t can be reached. 9. When conditions are not optimized (low T-wave height or high T-wave velocity and/or high IM pressure), the ions will not traverse through the IM device effectively, and their journey may take longer than the time required for the next ion packet to be released into the mobility cell. As a result, a new ion packet will be released from the Trap region before the previous packet has been delivered to the pusher region. This will lead to a 'roll-over' effect, in which the peak observed in the first part of the drift time spectrum is identical to that of the ions in the tailing edge ( Fig. 2C). This artifact can be eliminated by increasing the T-wave height, and decreasing T-wave velocity and IMS pressure. In addition, the Trap release time can be adjusted. Moreover, it is important to validate that the Transfer T-wave height is set to at least 5 V. To prevent leakage of ions towards the IMS cell, we recommend that the mobility trap height be kept at maximum levels (30 V). 10. Low velocity and high amplitude of Transfer T-waves may lead to the \"rippling\" of the drift time distribution profile (Fig. 2D). This artifact occurs when the mobility separation of ions (ion arrival/drift time) is not maintained through the Transfer and ToF regions, due to partial synchronization between the pusher frequency and the transfer T-wave velocity. In order to eliminate this effect, either the pusher time or the Transfer T-wave velocity should be adjusted. Since the pusher frequency is related to the mass range, this artifact may reappear when this parameter is changed. T-wave height exerts a minor effect, though its reduction may also help to eliminate ripples. 11. Once the aforementioned parameters are optimized, the IM-MS data can be acquired.",

            "text": "To achieve highly resolved MS peaks, protein complexes are often activated within the mass spectrometer, to promote the stripping of residual water and buffer components 11 . However, if the activation energy is increased beyond a threshold value, partial unfolding can be induced forming multiple intermediate states 12 , which are unlikely to correspond to the native, solution-state structure (Fig. 3A-C). As a result, the drift time peak may be shifted and broadened, reflecting the heterogeneous population of unfolded structures. In order to obtain drift time data consistent with solution-phase structures, it is essential to carefully control the voltages used for accelerating ions, prior to IM separation. Moreover, for high MS resolution it is preferable to increase the Transfer rather than the Trap voltage. As the IM device is positioned, first, followed by the Transfer region and the TOF analyzer, hence, the activation follows the IM measurement and the ions remains unaffected, while the MS accuracy can be increased.",

These measurements can provide a useful quality control of the methodology and will enable accuracy assessment of the acquisition parameters by comparing theoretical and measured \u03a9 values. The theoretical cross sectional areas can be calculated from the crystal structure coordinates using the MOBCAL An IM-MS strategy for defining topological arrangements of subunits within multicomponent assemblies has been recently proposed 4,6 . The method involves the monitoring of dissociation pathways of protein assemblies to smaller components. This dissociation is achieved through controlled adjustment of solution phase conditions, which gives rise to a distribution of subcomplexes reflective of the \"building blocks\" of the assemblies. The simultaneous measurement of \u03a9 values of both the intact complex and disassembly products generates structural restraints which are then used for calculating topological models of the protein complexes. The basic assumption underlying this methodology is that the generated subcomplexes retain their native-like confirmations, and indeed recent studies have demonstrated that the solution structure of the disassembly products is maintained and no major rearrangement in either solution or gas phases have occurred 4,6 . The last step in the assignment of quaternary structure to gas-phase protein complex ions is fitting the collision cross section values to computer generated models. Modeling approaches are employed in order to explore the different possible topological arrangements of subunits and their in silico \u03a9 values are calculated and compared to the experimental ones. Currently only a few computational approaches are used, like the spheretype coarse-grained method that approximates the diameter of subunits 1,8 . On the whole, this field is still in its early years and further development is required to make this approach generic, and applicable to a wide range of complexes.",
