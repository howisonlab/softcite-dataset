            "text": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Recently, anthocyanins have been reported to have various biological activities. Furthermore, anthocyanin-rich purple corn extract (PCE) ameliorated insulin resistance and reduced diabetes-associated mesanginal fibrosis and inflammation, suggesting that it may have benefits for the prevention of diabetes and diabetes complications. In this study, we determined the anthocyanins and non-anthocyanin component of PCE by HPLC-ESI-MS and investigated its anti-diabetic activity and mechanisms using C57BL/KsJ db/db mice. MATERIALS/METHODS: The db/db mice were divided into four groups: diabetic control group (DC), 10 or 50 mg/kg PCE (PCE 10 or PCE 50), or 10 mg/kg pinitol (pinitol 10) and treated with drugs once per day for 8 weeks. During the experiment, body weight and blood glucose levels were measured every week. At the end of treatment, we measured several diabetic parameters. RESULTS: Compared to the DC group, Fasting blood glucose levels were 68% lower in PCE 50 group and 51% lower in the pinitol 10 group. Furthermore, the PCE 50 group showed 2-fold increased C-peptide and adiponectin levels and 20% decreased HbA1c levels, than in the DC group. In pancreatic islets morphology, the PCE-or pinitol-treated mice showed significant prevention of pancreatic \u03b2-cell damage and higher insulin content. Microarray analyses results indicating that gene and protein expressions associated with glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism in liver and fat tissues. In addition, purple corn extract increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pase) genes in liver, and also increased glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expressions in skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that PCE exerted anti-diabetic effects through protection of pancreatic \u03b2-cells, increase of insulin secretion and AMPK activation in the liver of C57BL/KsJ db/db mice.",

            "text": "Recently, here has been a growing interest in hypoglycemic agents from natural products, especially those derived from plants, because compared to synthetic sources, plant sources are usually considered to be less toxic, and to have fewer side effects [2]. Many traditional remedies for diabetes mellitus involve the use of plant sources, and over 200 pure phyto-chemicals are currently known to have hypoglycemic properties. However, most of them have been shown to exert little or no effect on glycemic control in experimental studies [3]. Purple corn (Zea mays L.), is rich in anthocyanins and bioactive phenolics. It has been cultivated and used for centuries to prepare drinks and desserts in South America, mainly in Peru and Bolivia [4]. The anthocyanins present in the flowers, leaves, cobs, and seeds of Andean purple corn have previously been characterized, and the major anthocyanins identified were cyanidin-3-dimalonylglucoside, cyandin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, and their respective malonated counterparts [5]. Recently, anthocyanins have been reported to have various biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, and anticancer activities [6][7][8][9]. Furthermore, anthocyanin-rich purple corn extract (PCE) ameliorated insulin resistance and reduced diabetes-associated mesanginal fibrosis and inflammation, suggesting that it may have benefits for the prevention of diabetes and diabetes complications [10,11].",

The mobile phase was a binary elution of 5% formic acid solution (A) and 100% methanol (B) under the following gradient conditions: initial, 20% B; 7 min, 20% B; 15 min, 25% B; 32 min, 50% B; 36 min, 100% B; 38 min, 100% B; 40 min, 20% B and 45 min, 20% B. The flow rate was 700 \u03bcl/min, and the injection volume was 10 \u03bcl. Eluted substances were detected at 280 nm and 570 nm by using a photodiodearray detector between 200 and 600 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm. For the identification of major components, the column elute was split, and 0.2 ml\u2022min -1 was directed to a Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion-trap MS (Thermo Quest, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface after passing through the flow cell of the photodiode-array detector. Analysis was carried out using positive ion monitoring at a capillary temperature of 280\u00b0C, spray voltage of 5.5 kV, capillary voltage of 10 V and tube lens offset of -5.0 V. Spectral data were recorded using He gas as a collision gas. Anthocyanins and non-anthocyanins were detected using m/z value following MS/MS. The MS/MS collision energy was set to 35%.

Fig. 1B shows the chromatograms of anthocyanins identified in PCE. The 5 major anthocyanins were identified as cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, peonidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-(6\"malonyl-glucoside), and peonidin 3-(6\"-malonyl-glucoside) by using LC-ESI-MS ( Table 1). The MS/MS spectra of the anthocyanins provided clear and characteristic fragmentation data. The aglycones of anthocyanins were cyanidin (molecular weight [MW; 287]), peonidin (MW; 301) and pelargonidin (MW; 271). Table 2 shows the effects of PCE (10, 50) and pinitol 10 on metabolic parameters in diabetic db/db mice treated for 8 weeks.

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated that PCE significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia by reducing the blood glucose levels and increasing the serum insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and adiponectin concentrations in type 2 diabetic C57BL/KsJ db/db mice. Diabetes mellitus is sub-divided into two main forms. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is mainly due to an auto-immunemediated destruction of pancreatic \u03b2-cell islets. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by insufficient insulin secretion and insulin resistance [13]. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting approximately 3% of population worldwide. But the conventional pharmacological treatments for type 2 diabetes have a number of limitations, such as adverse effects and high rates of secondary failure [14]. Anthocyanins are a subclass of flavonoids that have been reported to improve insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia in several models of obesity and diabetes in rodents [15]. Interest in anthocyanins as natural colorants and valueadded ingredients has increased due to their color characteristics and potential health benefits. Chinese purple corn extracts were a natural source of anthocyanins and were stable over a wide range of temperatures and times [16]. This study identified 7 major non-anthocyanins and 5 major anthocyanins in puple corn extracts ( Table 1, Fig. 1). Recent studies indicate that diabetic atherosclerosis is not only a disease of hyperlipidemia but also an inflammatory disorder [17]. Existing evidence indicates that obesity-related insulin resistance results in a systemic prothrombotic state and might enhance the progression of atherosclerotic lesions [18]. In our study, we found that PCE 10 and PCE 50 groups showed 52% and 68% reduction in blood glucose levels, respectively, compared to DC group, but not significantly change body weight, food and water intake ( Table 2). The serum insulin level in the PCE 10 and Pinitol 10 treated db/db mice was significantly increased by 1.8 fold, 1.5 fold as compared to the control groups, respectively. Pinitol (D-3-O-methyl-chiro-inositol) has been reported to exert insulin-like effects. Pinitol extracted from Bougainvillea spectabilis reduced blood glucose in animal models of diabetes [19]. And also administration of PCE for 8 weeks resulted in significantly increased serum insulin, C-peptide, and adiponectin concentrations as compared to the DC group (Table 2). Similarly, Hong et al. [20] had reported that insulin level increased after treatment of purple corn anthocyanins in pancreatic \u03b2-cell. In the present study was also a significant increase in the levels of serum insulin and less destructed \u03b2-cells after administration of PCE to db/db mice. PCE less destructed \u03b2-cells and increased insulin secretion by decreasing blood glucose (Fig. 3).",

PCE significantly inhibited increases in the blood glucose level during the OGTT in db/db mice (Fig. 2). PCE significantly improved glucose tolerance and this fact could be attributed to the potentiation of the insulin effect of plasma by increasing the pancreatic secretion of insulin from existing \u03b2-cells or its release from bound insulin.",

            "text": "AMPK belongs to the family of energy sensing enzymes that are activated by cellular stresses resulting in ATP depletion, thus acting like a 'fuel gauge' [30]. Upon activation, AMPK functions to restore cellular ATP by inhibiting ATP consumption processes as well as accelerating ATP generation processes [31]. This cascade is activated by stresses such as prolonged exercise, electrical stimulation of skeletal muscle, heart muscle ischemia, and through inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle or oxidative phosphorylation [32,33]. As shown in Fig. 4A, PCE significantly phosphorylated AMPK and ACC compared to DC group. The phosphorylation of ACC decreases its activity and the concentration of malonyl CoA, the resulting product from the reaction, was decreased so that the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1), which delivers fatty acid by using mitochondrial for acid oxidation was promoted [34]. In general, activation of AMPK down-regulates biosynthetic pathways such as fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, yet switches on catabolic pathways that generate ATP, such as fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake and glycolysis. In this study, we founded that PCE reduced hepatic glucose production through AMPK activation and ACC inactivation and decreased PEPCK or G6Pase gene expression (Fig. 4B). The AMPK pathway is a major mechanism enhancing glucose transport into skeletal muscle [35]. Skeletal muscle is the main site for glucose disposal in the body and there are two ways to stimulate glucose uptake into skeletal muscle: insulin dependent and insulin independent. Insulin resistance is one of the early defects detected in the muscle of diabetes patients and insulin resistance is mainly caused by insulin signaling pathway defects. Activation of AMPK by AICAR in rat or muscle cells overexpressing constitutively active AMPK increases glucose uptake and causes translocation of the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4 from microvesicles to the plasma membrane, establishing the link between AMPK activation, glucose transport and the translocation of glucose transporters [35]. As shown in Fig. 4B, PCE markedly stimulated GLUT4 gene expression.",
