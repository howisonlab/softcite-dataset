In the latest radiographs, osteolysis and atrophy were observed in 19% and 27% of the acetabulae and 21% and 62% of the femurs, respectively. The mean HHS at the fi nal follow-up was 83 (15-100)."

            "text": "Interpretation -The clinical score after THR in these young patients was acceptable, but many revisions had been performed. However, young patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip had lower implant survival. Moreover, the bone stock in these patients was poor, which could complicate future revisions. \u25a0 Total hip replacement (THR) is rarely recommended for children and young adults because several revisions can be expected. Young age and high activity levels are well-known risk factors for revision (M\u00fcnger et al. 2006, Flugsrud et al. 2007. After revision, implant survival is poor and recovery of hip function is worse than after primary THR (Lie et al. 2004, Bischel et al. 2012, Adelani et al. 2014. Besides, reduction in bone stock makes multiple revisions complicated (Bischel et al. 2012).",

Osteolysis was defi ned as a non-linear lucency of 3 mm or more around the prosthesis (Claus et al. 2003). Loosening of an acetabular component was determined from evidence of migration and a radiolucent line (Hodgkinson et al. 1988, Johnston et al. 1990). An acetabular component was diagnosed as \"loose\" when it had migrated more than 4 mm in either the horizontal or the vertical direction, or if it had tilted by more than 5\u00b0. Cemented acetabular components that had continuous radiolucent lines with any thickness in all 3 zones were categorized as being loose. Uncemented acetabular components that had radiolucent lines wider than 2 mm in all 3 zones were categorized as being loose. Loosening of an uncemented stem was defi ned by whether the stem was considered to be unstable according to the criteria of Engh et al. (1990). Loosening of a cemented stem was defi ned by whether we found a continuous radiolucent line around the stem, or stem subsidence of > 5 mm. Bone defects were assessed using Paprosky's classifi cations (Paprosky et al. 1994, Della Valle andPaprosky 2004). Bone areas with reduced density in the acetabulum and proximal femur were recorded as \"atrophy\" (Wangen et al. 2008). Thinning of the femoral cortex adjacent to a well-fi xed stem was recorded as \"cortical atrophy\" (Figure 2). Heterotopic ossifi cation was defi ned using the classifi cation of Brooker et al. (1973). In 3 hips, the proximal femur was replaced with a tumor prosthesis, so we evaluated the acetabular component only. In 1 hip, all the implants had been removed, so we assessed bone defects only. Leg-length discrepancy (LLD) was assessed by comparing the heights of greater or lesser trochanters relative to the line connecting the teardrops of the acetabulum. If the deformity was severe or if the proximal femur was replaced with a tumor prosthesis, we did not evaluate the patient's LLD. For analysis radiographs, we used Mdesk Orthopaedics software (RSA Biomedical, Ume\u00e5, Sweden).",

Patients with DDH had especially poor survival. These results confi rm that THR is still a challenging treatment for children and teenage patients. There have been few reports on THRs in such patients with a mean follow-up period of more than 10 years. Regarding cemented THRs in the 1970s, Cage et al. (1992) observed gross implant loosening in 7 of the 22 cases at a mean follow-up of 11 years and Torchia et al. (1996) reported revision in 27 of 63 THRs and failure (revision or symptomatic loosening) in 29 hips at a mean follow-up of 13 years. Little is known about the long-term outcome of modern THR in very young patients. Bessette et al. (2003) reported the outcome of 15 THRs performed between 1975 and 1990 with a mean follow-up of 14 years; 11 of the 15 were uncemented; 5 hips were revised, and the mean HHS was 65. The THRs in our study were performed after 1987. The overall survival rate was similar to those in previous reports, but it is encouraging that survival had improved in the later period of 11 years. Although our study cohort was too small for us to perform statistical evaluation, we assume that improvements in surgical techniques and implants contributed to this improvement-as well as the introduction of highly cross-linked polyethylene (Digas et al. 2007) and better control of juvenile idiopathic arthritis with biological agents (Gartlehner et al. 2008).",

Reduction of bone stock is a major concern in revision (Deirmengian et al. 2011, Sakellariou andBabis 2014). We observed reduced bone stock around both non-revised and revised implants.

Nevertheless, to date this has been the largest study on modern THR to focus on children and teenage patients (Cage et al. 1992, Torchia et al. 1996, Bessette et al. 2003. Although statistical analysis may be inappropriate, we believe that this study will give surgeons and patients a clinical overview of THR in children and teenagers and help in decision making. Another limitation was the low coverage of patients with bone tumors. THRs performed for tumors are often only reported to another registry: that of the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (Aksnes et al. 2008). However, such patients do not usually have alternatives to THR. We therefore believe that the main purpose of our study-to help surgeons and patients in decision making for THR-could be accomplished without including tumors.",
