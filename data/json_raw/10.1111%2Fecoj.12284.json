While standard theory predicts that equal markup prices solve the credence goods problem if customers can verify the quality received, experimental evidence indicates the opposite. We identify a lack of robustness with respect to heterogeneity in social preferences as a possible cause of this and conduct new experiments that allow for parsimonious identification of sellers' social preference types. Our results confirm the assumed heterogeneity in social preferences and provide strong support for our explanation of the failure of verifiability to increase efficiency.",

Almost all contributions to the literature build on the assumption of common knowledge that agents are rational own-money maximisers who behave as desired when kept indifferent in own-money termssee Bolton and Dewatripont (2005) for a textbook coverage of this approach. In this article, we argue that while this assumption is harmless in some applicationsbecause it results in institutions that are almost optimal if preferences are almost as assumedit is misleading in others.",

In such markets, theory predicts that equal-mark-up prices solve the problem if customers can verify the quality received (Dulleck and Kerschbamer, 2006). However, this prediction is refuted by existing experimental evidence which indicates that markets with verifiability perform no better than markets without (Dulleck et al., 2011). We identify a lack of robustness of institutional design with respect to heterogeneity in social preferences as a possible cause. By social preferences, we mean that subjects may not only care for their own material pay-off but may consider the pay-offs of others as well, when making decisions.",

The results obtained in an implementation of the test indicate that less than a fourth of the experimental sellers behave in accordance with the standard assumption on preferences. The rest behave either in line with other forms of selfish preferences or in accordance with different variants of non-selfish social preferences. Taken together our experimental findings provide strong support for heterogeneity in social preferences and for our explanation of the failure of verifiability to increase efficiency. Based on this observation, we argue that future research should search for an institutional design that is robust against preference heterogeneity. Such research seems especially important for markets for credence goods where inefficient institutions potentially cause huge economic costs. 1 The next subsection describes the main problems emerging from the asymmetric information in markets for credence goods and explains how verifiability helps to solve them in theory. The subsequent subsection summarises the experimental evidence showing that verifiability fails empirically and sketches our explanation for the failure.",

For example, in the market for medical treatments a patient might be unable to distinguish a cheap from an expensive drug infusion. In the car repair market, the owner might be unable to observe whether a broken part has been repaired or replaced. The informational asymmetries on credence goods markets may cause a variety of problems and inefficiencies. Expert sellers may provide unnecessarily high quality (a case referred to as 'overtreatment'), or insufficiently low quality ('undertreatment'), or they may charge for a higher quality than provided ('overcharging'). Such cases are not only a theoretical possibility but are well documented in the literature. Empirical evidence for considerable market inefficiencies is available, among others, for the health care sector (Hughes and Yule, 1992;Gruber and Owings, 1996;Gruber et al., 1999;Iizuka, 2007), for car repairs (Wolinsky, 1993;Hubbard, 1998;Schneider, 2012) and for taxi rides (Balafoutas et al., 2013).",

With such prices an expert earns the same profit independently of the quality she provides (sellers are referred to as she and consumers as he throughout to make the reference clear although in practice they can both be of either sex). Thus, under the mentioned standard assumption on preferences, such prices induce the expert to provide the appropriate quality of the credence good.

Implementing verifiability means that consumers are able to observe and verify ex post the quality of the provided good (without knowing, however, whether this quality is the appropriate one). Therefore, in treatment V-Endo the last stage in Figure 1 is degenerate because the expert has to charge the price for the provided quality.

Compared to treatment N-Endo, verifiability has no significant impact on the frequency of interaction, the undertreatment rate, the overtreatment rate and overall efficiency. The overall performance in both treatments is better than the standard prediction for treatment N-Endo but worse than the standard prediction for treatment V-Endo.

A possible explanation for the relatively high interaction rate and the relatively low undertreatment rate in N-Endo is experts having a taste for efficiency. Another possible explanation is that experts care for equitable pay-offs. Support for the latter hypothesis comes from the analysis of price-posting behaviour. Contrary to the theoretical prediction, equal-mark-up prices are very rare in V-Endo. They are chosen in less than 5% of all transactions. Table 2 reports the frequencies of the five most popular pricevectors posted by sellers in the two treatments. It is interesting to note that in treatment V-Endo only one equal-mark-up vector is among the top five price-vectors but it is not the  predicted one. In both treatments, the price-vector (6, 8) is by far the most frequently posted price-vector. If the seller always provided the appropriate quality and charged for it, then this price-vector would split the gains from trade equally between the consumer and the seller both when the consumer needs the low and when he needs the high quality. The prominence of this price-vector therefore suggests that a concern for relative pay-offs plays a role for aggregate behaviour in the experiment.",

To see this, note that the standard prediction for equal-markup pricesappropriate quality independent of the level of the mark-upis already a best-case scenario that leaves no room for improvement. Consider an EL expert, for instance. Since the material pay-off of the customer enters positively in her utility function, she will act in the interest of the consumer along the equal-mark-up line, where helping the customer involves no cost. Furthermore, since @U =@p c [ 0 in both domains (i.e. in the domain of advantageous inequality and in the domain of disadvantageous inequality) the EL expert will provide the appropriate quality even under price-vectors that deviate (slightly) from the equal-mark-up rule. Thus, EL experts necessarily provide appropriate quality in a corridor along the equal-mark-up lineas shown in Figure 5 but they do not perform better than SE experts at the equal-mark-up line. 10 The same is true for other experts with pro-social otherregarding preferencesunder equal-mark-up prices they behave as predicted but do not behave better than predicted. However, anti-social other-regarding preferences easily manifest themselves in a worse market outcome than predicted under standard preferences because hurting the customer involves no cost under equal-mark-up prices. Consider a SP expert, for instance. Since the material pay-off of the customer enters negatively in her utility function, she necessarily provides q 1 to a consumer who needs q 0 ; and q 0 to a consumer who needs q 1 , along the equal-mark-up line where hurting the customer involves no cost.

A closer look at the data reveals that the difference is entirely due to the provision behaviour under the price-vector (3,8), which is present in V-Exo1 but absent in V-Exo2. In fact, Table 5 shows thatcontrolling for price-vectorsthere is no significant difference between V-Exo1 and V-Exo2, both with respect to overtreatment and undertreatment. This also implies that, conditional on the price-vector and the quality needed by the consumer, there is no difference in the likelihood of appropriate treatment across treatments. 11 These results allow us to pool the data from the two treatments in the following analysis of social preference types. In order to classify sellers according to their social preferences, we first look at violations of monotonicity according to Lemma 1. It turns out that 45 out of 64 sellers (70%) behave in line with the statement over all 16 periods of the experiment. Taking into account that some learning may go on in early periods, we decided to focus on the final 12 periods only (i.e. on periods 5-16). In those periods the behaviour of 56 out of 64 sellers (88%) respects the monotonicity condition. This high degree of consistent behaviour is encouraging, because it suggests that stable (non-standard) preferences, rather than noise or any kind of confusion of subjects, drives our findings. Of the 56 sellers whose behaviour is consistent with Lemma 1, we had to exclude three from further analysis due to lack of data caused by customers' opting out. 12 Our data analysis is therefore based on 53 sellers.",

If we do not allow for learning in early periods then we lose eight of the 53 observations. Interestingly, we do not lose a single experimental seller who reveals a willingness to give up own material pay-off to change the material pay-off of the customer. 15 This suggests that selfish sellers do need some time to find out the ownmoney-maximising strategy while strong EL and strong IA 'know how they want to behave' from the beginning. Since strong EL and strong IA reveal a willingness to give up own material pay-off to change the material pay-off of the customer, while the other types appearing with non-zero entries in Table 6 do not, one would expect that the former two types earn lesson averagethan the rest. This is indeed what we find in the data. Tables C4 and C5 in the online Appendix C displayfor the seller types in Table 6 the average profits per period conditional on an interaction having taken place. While the entries for strong EL and strong IA are 2.37 and 2.22 respectively the other types earn 2.48, on average. If we put strong EL and strong IA sellers in one tub and all the other sellers in a second tub then the difference across tubs in average profits per period (conditional on an interaction having taken place) is significant at the 5% level (p = 0.03, Mann-Whitney U-test, N = 53).

This insight is important for several reasons. First, it is important for the current applicationinstitutional design for credence goods markets under verifiabilitybecause it provides an explanation for both, why equal-mark-up price-vectors do not work as predicted by theory and why such vectors were not chosen in the endogenous pricing conditions of Dulleck et al. (2011). Second, it is important for institutional design for markets plagued by asymmetric information more generally, because it suggests that institutional design based on the standard assumption on preferences might yield bad incentives for some or even many agents. The results reported in Table 6 also confirm the heterogeneity in social preferences on which our discussion in Section 2 is based. Some sellers care for efficiency, some for equality of pay-offs, and some do not care for the well-being of others (or for efficiency) at all.",

Second, the standard solution to the credence goods problem for the case where the quality of the goods is verifiableequal-mark-up pricesis non-robust against the presence of agents with anti-social other-regarding preferences.",

The experimental design rather directly tests the key characteristics of different variants of social preferences that have been discussed in the economics literature.

Specifically, we have found in an implementation of our test that less than a quarter of the experimental sellers behave according to the standard assumption on preferences (that all agents are rational own-money maximisers who behave as desired if held indifferent in own-money terms). The rest behave either in line with other forms of selfish or in accordance with different variants of non-selfish other-regarding preferences. An immediate implication is that institutional design based on the standard assumption of lexicographically maximising agents yields bad incentives for some or possibly many agents. Another implication of our experimental results is that there are agents that behave appropriately, independent of the institutional design. Taken together these two observations have two important consequences, one for institutional design and the other for agent selection.",

The undertreatment rate is zero in V-Endo under this price-vector but it is based on only seven cases, which prevents meaningful testing of whether the provision behaviour under equal-mark-up price-vectors depends on whether the price-vector has been chosen endogenously or determined exogenously.12  We included all experts who under price-vector \u03a9 had treated at least one customer needing q 0 AND at least one customer needing q 1 ; 50 of the 56 sellers were included under this rule.

Especially in the medical realm success is often impossible or very costly to measure for a court, while still being observed by the consumer. On the other hand, even in cases where success is verifiable strict liability might pose problems. For instance, an insufficiently repaired car may work for some time before it breaks down. To mitigate the undertreatment problem in such a situation the liability needs to cover a longer period. But during this longer period the car may stop working for reasons unrelated to the expert's behaviour. Also, an extended liability period may induce fraudulent behaviour on the side of the customer as he may not put in the required maintenance efforta problem that has previously been discussed byTaylor (1995).\u00a9 2015 The Authors.

Instead of choosing doctors, mechanics or computer specialists exclusively according to their training, customers or their representatives should also take into consideration the attitudes of these experts towards their customers. Selecting the right agents may also help to solve problems created by uncertainty over input costs: with cost uncertainty standard theory would predict that verifiability cannot solve the problems on credence goods marketsa problem ignored in the formal literature on credence goods thus far. Our results suggest that verifiability can solve this problem if the 'right' agents are selected: Efficiency loving experts provide appropriate treatment in a corridor along the equalmark-up line; that is, even if monetary incentives are not perfectly in line. Hence, the crucial task of potential employers or buyers is to identify experts with the right social preferences. Public policy might step in here, for instance, by screening applicants for particular jobs (like in the health care sector, for instance) not only after their performance in entry examinations but also in accordance with their social track record. Since the 'effort cost' for performing social activities is arguably lower for more 'consumer-friendly' types, a CV featuring an impressive track record of volunteer work might well act as a screening device.
