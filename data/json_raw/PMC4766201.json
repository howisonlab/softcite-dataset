            "text": "The aim of this study is to characterize the patterns of medication use by early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) survivors from diagnosis to 1 year post-chemotherapy. Methods A single-center longitudinal study was conducted with ESBC patients diagnosed between December 2011 and June 2014. Data on the medication use of individual patients were retrieved from prescription databases, supplemented by records from the National Electronic Health Records. The data covered the period from ESBC diagnosis to 1 year post-chemotherapy. Medication types were classified according to the World Health Organization's Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, and medication for chronic diseases was created by adapting a list of 20 chronic diseases provided by the U.S. Department of Human and Health Services. Results Of the 107 patients involved in the study (mean age 51.1\u00b18.4 years; 78.5 % Chinese), 46.7 % manifested non-cancer comorbidities, of which hypertension (24.3 %) was the most prevalent, followed by hyperlipidemia (13.1 %) and diabetes (5.6 %). Calcium channel blockers (12.1 %) and lipid-modifying agents (11.2 %) were the most common chronic medication types used before chemotherapy, and their use persisted during chemotherapy (10.3 and 11.2 %, respectively) and after chemotherapy (11.2 and 13.1 %, respectively). Hormonal therapy was the predominant post-chemotherapy medication (77.6 %). A statistically significant increase (p<0.0001) was observed in the mean number of chronic disease medication classes prescribed to patients between the prechemotherapy (0.53\u00b11.04) and chemotherapy (0.62\u00b11.08) periods and between the chemotherapy and postchemotherapy (1.63\u00b11.35) periods. Conclusions There is an increase in trend of chronic medication usage in breast cancer survivors after cancer treatment. This study provides important insights into the design of medication management programs tailored to this population. Future studies should incorporate a control population to improve the interpretation of study results."

Globally, breast cancer is the second most common form of cancer, exhibited by approximately 19.2 % of all cancer patients [1]. Early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) survival rates have increased in the last decade. There are numerous possible explanations for the increased likelihood of survival, such as the early detection of cancer [2] and the development of more effective systemic therapies in the form of cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted therapies [3,4]. Due to the ageing population and the expected increase in breast cancer incidence, the pool of ESBC survivors is likely to become considerably larger in the coming decades [5,6].",

These may manifest as long-term effects during active therapy or late effects that persist for months to years after active treatment. These effects may be temporary, progressive, or permanent and range from mild to severe, debilitating, and even life threatening. Complications may arise from surgery (pain, numbness, weakness, lymphedema), chemotherapy (cognitive dysfunction, neuropathy, sexual dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction), radiotherapy (pain, atrophy, fibrosis, late cardiac effects of left breast radiation), and the disease itself (psychosocial problems, fatigue, pain, sleep disorder, depression/anxiety) [5,9]. The use of adjuvant hormonal therapy in the form of tamoxifen has been associated with menopause-like side effects such as hot flushes, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and an increased risk of uterine cancer and thromboembolic events. The use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is associated with vaginal dryness, arthralgia, and an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Therefore, survivors of ESBC are likely to require different types of medication throughout their treatment journeys, primarily to manage changes in treatment-related complications.",

Therefore, most patients diagnosed with breast cancer belong to a subset of a larger population of mid-life women with chronic conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease [10][11][12]. Otte et al. reported that the majority of breast cancer survivors exhibit at least two non-cancerrelated comorbidities [10]. This observation is consistent with the findings of another study, in which more than 60 % of the sampled breast cancer survivors were prescribed medication for comorbidities, and 53 % reported using non-prescription therapies concurrently [13]. Therefore, it is vital that the use of medication by breast cancer survivors is effectively managed to facilitate medication adherence, prevent drug-drug interaction, and ensure the efficacy of cancer treatment and chronic medication [10,14].",

In summary, cardiovascular medication was the most common class of medication prescribed for chronic diseases, with a significant increase in the use of hormonal therapies, bone disease medication, and psychoanaleptics during the post-chemotherapy period. The number of medication classes prescribed for chronic disease management also increased during the post-chemotherapy period, in comparison with the periods before and during chemotherapy. Dermatologicals and medication associated with the alimentary tract, the metabolism, and the nervous system were the most prevalent forms of non-chronic disease medication during chemotherapy. In contrast, vitamins, dermatologicals, musculoskeletal medication, and analgesics were predominant during the post-chemotherapy period. The results of this study make an important contribution to the literature on the numerous treatment-related complications [7,8,18,19] and chronic disease management needs associated with breast cancer. The characterization of medication use offers invaluable insights into the medication management needs of a population of breast cancer survivors, potentially facilitating the development of dedicated medicine management services for women who have achieved complete remission after treatment. Between ESBC diagnosis and the beginning of chemotherapy, changes to the participants' medication were made primarily to manage treatment-related complications. The trend in medication use during chemotherapy suggests that the patients experienced treatment-related complications in the following forms: gastrointestinal side effects (mucositis, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia), which are commonly exhibited by patients receiving taxanes and anthracycline-containing regimens; neurological effects (anxiety, insomnia); and dermatological side effects (probably secondary to taxanes).",

Long-term hormonal therapy in the form of AIs or tamoxifen causes side effects that must be managed. This explains the prevalence of medication for osteoporosis (bisphosphonates, calcium/vitamin D supplements) and musculoskeletal symptoms (NSAIDs, analgesics, muscle relaxants, glucosamine), to manage AI-associated musculoskeletal effects, and the increased use of Ophthalmological anti-inflammatories 1 (0.9) 0 2 (1.9)"

It is important to note that the effects of estrogen deprivation were not solely due to hormonal therapy but were probably compounded by the significant reduction in estrogen levels in peri-and post-menopausal women, who made up more than half of the sample population [40 (57.1 %)]. In addition, glucosamine, analgesics, and NSAIDs may have been used to manage osteoarthritis, as the majority of the population exhibited osteoarthritis risk factors [20][21][22] associated with gender (female), weight (overweight/obese), and age (elderly). The use of psychoanaleptics probably reflects the need to manage the long-term psychosocial effects of cancer and its treatment [18,19]. The significant increase in the burden of medication for chronic diseases from the periods before and during chemotherapy to the post-chemotherapy period was primarily due to the introduction of hormonal therapies in addition to preexisting cardiovascular medication. Therefore, the breast cancer survivors in our population are likely to face medication management problems such as reduced adherence and adverse effects. In a recent systematic review, breast cancer survivors were found to show suboptimal adherence and persistence rates in response to adjuvant hormonal therapy (31-73 % discontinuation rates) [23], which may compromise the longterm survival benefits of such therapy. Adherence was positively associated with the number of medication types taken at baseline, referral to an oncologist and earlier diagnosis, and negatively associated with treatment side effects and followup with a general practitioner (as compared with an oncologist) [23]. This demonstrates the importance of ongoing follow-up in the oncology setting and the need to manage adverse effects to facilitate adherence to adjuvant hormonal therapy. These imperatives are especially important for our breast cancer survivor population, as only a minority had received long-term medication for chronic diseases before starting hormonal therapy. It is also essential to simultaneously monitor and manage the use of medication for other pre-existing chronic diseases such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Middle-aged non-cancer patients have been reported to show suboptimal adherence to antihypertensives [24] and cardiovascular medication such as lipidlowering medications for primary or secondary prevention, potentially compromising their cardiovascular-associated mortality and morbidity benefits. Such information contains major implications to our breast cancer survivors. In this study, our patients tend to be young (average of 50 years) and diagnosed with few comorbidities; such demographics are very similar to the national average among Singaporeans. For example, the prevalence of hypertension is 24 % in our study which is similar to the national survey (23.5 %) [25]. Hence, medication compliance remains an important issue, and clinicians must ensure that these survivors adhere to their prescribed adjuvant hormonal therapies and chronic medications.",

Although oncology specialists continue to play critical roles in diagnosis and initial treatment, the activities of primary care providers (general practitioners and community pharmacists) have been expanded to cover early cancer screening, post-treatment follow-up and surveillance for cancer recurrence, screening and management of the long-term effects of cancer, and its treatment, medication management, health promotion, and chronic disease management [9,26]. As a result, numerous models of cancer survivorship care have been developed and discussed in the literature [27][28][29], with the aim of establishing a coordinated care partnership between oncology specialists and primary care providers. Primary care providers are likely to become responsible for managing the medication of breast cancer survivors during the postchemotherapy phase. Furthermore, rising health costs demand that the long-term management of breast cancer survivors is delegated to the primary setting and that medication management is effective. Although primary care may have an increasingly large part to play in the management of cancer survivors, the roles of healthcare workers in the tertiary setting remain crucial, as the majority of breast cancer survivors follow-up with their oncologists in their first year after chemotherapy. Oncology pharmacists are in the best position to understand these patients' diverse medication management needs (both cancerrelated and non-cancer-related), and they need to be part of the multidisciplinary team to manage the long-term complications experienced by this group of patients. A more concrete understanding of the needs of breast cancer survivors will aid the development of individualized cancer survivorship plans in our setting to improve the coordination of care and make effective use of our pharmacists' diverse skill sets in the multidisciplinary management of breast cancer survivors.",

Our findings suggest that ESBC survivors are likely to receive numerous forms of longterm medication, of which the most common are hormonal therapy and pre-existing cardiovascular medication. In addition, we show that the medication use of breast cancer survivors undergoes several changes from the pre-to postchemotherapy periods. These changes are usually made to manage treatment-related complications. These findings provide preliminary insights into the treatment-related complications experienced by breast cancer survivors in our local population and their chronic disease management needs. These insights will help both oncology specialists and primary care providers to assess patients' needs during long-term follow-up treatment, as well as guiding the development of dedicated medication management services for ESBC survivors. Future researchers should compare the medication use of ESBC survivors with that of a healthy population to obtain clearer information on the trends in medication use and, more importantly, the medication management needs of breast cancer survivors."
