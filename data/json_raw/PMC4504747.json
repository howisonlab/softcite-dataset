            "text": "Aim To evaluate the association with diabetic kidney disease of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. Methods The mitochondrial genome and 1039 nuclear genes that are integral to mitochondrial function were investigated using a case (n = 823 individuals with diabetic kidney disease) vs. control (n = 903 individuals with diabetes and no renal disease) approach. All people included in the analysis were of white European origin and were diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes before the age of 31 years. Replication was conducted in 5093 people with similar phenotypes to those of the discovery collection. Association analyses were performed using the PLINK genetic analysis toolset, with adjustment for relevant covariates. Results A total of 25 SNPs were evaluated in the mitochondrial genome, but none were significantly associated with diabetic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. A total of 38 SNPs in nuclear genes influencing mitochondrial function were nominally associated with diabetic kidney disease and 16 SNPS were associated with end-stage renal disease, secondary to diabetic kidney disease, with meta-analyses confirming the same direction of effect. Three independent signals (seven SNPs) were common to the replication data for both phenotypes with Type 1 diabetes and persistent proteinuria or end-stage renal disease. Conclusions Our results suggest that SNPs in nuclear genes that influence mitochondrial function are significantly associated with diabetic kidney disease in a white European population.",

            "text": "Diabetic kidney disease is a complex renal disorder representing a major global economic burden [1,2]. There is an inherited genetic predisposition for diabetic kidney disease, but the majority of studies to date have focused on genetic variation in the nuclear genome [3]. Mitochondria are specialized organelles that generate energy by oxidative phosphorylation, but they are susceptible to oxidative damage from cellular stress, including hyperglycaemia and exposure to a uraemic environment. Chronic inflammation is a common contributor to progressive renal failure and leads to premature mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. Pathogenic mutations in mtDNA represent an increasingly recognized cause of chronic morbidity, and mitochondrial mutations have been implicated in a range of complex disorders, including kidney disease [4][5][6]. There is a synergistic relationship between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, with the expression of nuclear genes being essential for critical mitochondrial functions.",

Control subjects (n = 903) were people with at least 15 years' duration of Type 1 diabetes, with no evidence of renal disease on repeated testing. Control subjects were not prescribed anti-hypertensive medication to avoid misclassification of phenotype, as blood pressurelowering treatment may reduce proteinuria.

In the present study, none of the genotyped SNPs in the mitochondrial genome were significantly associated with diabetic kidney disease, but the majority were present at very low frequency meaning that the discovery collection was only adequately powered to identify a statistically significant association for five of the 25 SNPs investigated. It should be noted that only 25 SNPs, from the mitochondrial genome, were present on the Omni1-quad array so only a limited number of mitochondrial SNPs were considered for their association with diabetic kidney disease using this array-based method. It is conceivable that more comprehensive examination of the entire mitochondrial genome by next-generation sequencing methods would identify hundreds of inherited and somatic mutations and some of these mitochondrial variants may be associated with diabetic kidney disease. Seven SNPs, representing three independent signals across five nuclear genes (COQ5, COX6A1, GATC, TOP1MT and PARCRG) were associated with both diabetic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in the discovery and in silico replication analyses.",

There are multiple genes within this linkage disequilibrium block, making it challenging to identify potential biological roles for these intronic or intergenic mutations (Fig. S1). Coenzyme Q is an antioxidant essential for electron-transport in the respiratory chain of the mitochondria; coenzyme Q5 homologue (COQ5) encodes methyltransferase. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is an enzyme, catalysing the last step in the respiratory cycle, transferring electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen. This process is then coupled to the translocation of protons in the inner mitochondrial membrane. A total of 13 subunits comprise COX, of which three larger subunits are encoded by mtDNA and the remaining 10 are encoded by nuclear DNA [17]. COX deficiencies have been previously associated with clinical phenotypes including neurological disorders, Leigh syndrome, cardiomyopathy and hepatopathy [17]. The effect of the intronic SNP located in the COX6A1 may lead to an increase in oxidative stress within the kidney. Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase, subunit C (GATC) is a protein-coding gene, and clusters with long non-coding RNA.",

It catalyses the temporary breaking of the DNA and allows the DNA to turn in a controlled rotation, before covalently linking the DNA to relax the super coiling [18].",

More comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial genome and genotyping in a larger population, such as the recently funded Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Genetics of Diabetic Nephropathy Collaborative Research Initiative, are required to robustly consider this approach for diabetic kidney disease. SNP-SNP interaction analyses for SNPs in the mitochondrial genome, did not reveal further associations in the present study.
