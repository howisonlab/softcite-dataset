Among these compounds, are pharmaceuticals that meet long duration of use and potentially could be misused and taken more than the ordered dosage. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate mutagenic effect of methadone in addicted patients referred to Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz by single cell gel electrophoresis technic or comet assay. Patients and Methods: In this study, 90 subjects were divided into dichromate treated group, no treated healthy volunteers group and test group. Each group included 30 subjects. Screening was performed according to questionnaire and qualified subjects were entered the study. Blood samples were collected and lymphocytes were isolated, mixed with low melting point agarose for slide preparation according to standard method. Slides were analyzed using fluorescence microscope and comet patterns were assessed. Results: The mutagenicity index in addicted group was robustly higher than healthy volunteers. Fortunately, this significant difference was lower than positive control. Conclusions: Genome instability in addicted patients was demonstrated in this study. Controversially, considering incoherent results of previous studies and our data, more studies in longer duration of methadone use are needed to elucidate the consequence.",

            "text": "Methadone hydrochloride (synthetic derivative of diphenyl heptane) is an opioid analgesic used for moderate to light pain and detoxification and maintenance treatment of addiction to opioid (3). Methadone is similar to morphine, but its effect is somewhat longer than morphine. At least its potency and efficiency is equal to morphine. Methadone is effective via orally consumption and drug tolerance and physical dependence is slower than morphine. Symptoms of drug withdrawal after abrupt discontinuation of methadone are milder but longer than morphine. These characteristics made methadone as a medication for detoxification and maintenance treatment of chronic addiction to heroin (4). Methadone is a part of admitted program of FDA to detoxification, which acts through binding to opioid receptors in CNS and inhibition of pain pathway and general CNS depression (3). Methadone clearance is increased in pregnant women and its half-life is decreased in the third trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, to achieve an effective result, its dosage should be increased and frequency of dosages should be reduced. Detoxification by methadone is performed long-term and short-term and alcohol, benzodiazepines and medications for HIV or hepatitis can be used concomitantly (5).",

Percent of mutagenicity index (MI) was significantly lower in the test group compared to positive control and conversely, it was higher compared to the negative control group. Addicted patients showed more than two fold MI% compared to negative control or normal samples. Damaged cells in the test group were significantly higher compared to negative control. Altogether, instability of genome was demonstrated for addicted patients according to scores obtained for damaged cells.",

Micronuclei occurrences along with number of chromatids' changes taking place in the metaphase indicate genetic mutation. Two control groups with elements of genetic mutation were used. Increased ratio of number of cells to immense chromatid changes are indicators of genetic toxicity of methadone, although these changes are not so apparent in other groups facing mutagen (8). As indicated by these studies, genetic mutation in patients treated with methadone is controversial and therefore in this study we investigated its possible genotoxic effect. Lowest concentration of sodium dichromate, which causes a break in DNA strand is 50 \u00b5M, correlating to the dosage can increase to its maximum amount of 500 \u00b5M. higher concentrations of dichromate would cause the curve of DNA strand breaks vs. dichromate concentrations to turn into plateau. The reason for this phenomenon could be cross binding of DNA-DNA and protein-DNA, which would prevent DNA migration or could be satura-tion of activation paths to dichromate (like decrease in GSH) or even modifications in improved mechanism of DNA. Therefore, sodium dichromate in 500 \u00b5M concentration can be used as a positive control for comparison or revealing other unknown mutating agents (13).",

In the experiment using comet assay, increasing concentrations (10 \u00b5M, 50 and 500) had a correlating effect in breaking the number of DNA strands (23). Percentages of healthy and mutated cells (in pattern of comet) for the experimental group were determined and compared to percentage of health and mutated cells in the control groups (Figure 1). Figure  2 demonstrated the rate of mutation of experimental group and control groups, rate of mutation of experimental group compared to control group is deemed negative. There is a significant difference between the two groups. This can be an indication of instability of genome in patients participating in the experiment, compared to control group regarding scores in the experiment. Figure 2 compares percentage of comet mass patterns between the experimental and control groups. In the control groups, zero scores were most prevalent and score ones were next in the numbers. In the experimental groups, scores of 1 and 3 reduced respectively. There are no 2 and 3 scores in the negative control groups. Although, there were 2 and 3 scores in the experimental group, and there was a significant statistical difference with these scores in the negative control group, this difference could indicate instability in the genome of experimental group compared to the negative control group.",

This difference could be an indication of less stability of genome of experimental group patients compared to negative control group. Perez-Alvarez and Cuenca-Lopez observed that high concentrations of methadone are needed to induce death in SH-SY5Y cells. Methadone leads to a kind of cellular death and has greater similarity to necrosis than apoptosis. Cell cultures show a change in outer mitochondria membrane potential and it has been compromised and penetrable. No engagement was observed by controlling proteins of apoptosis such as BCL-XL and p53 in this process. This study showed that a reduction in cell energy level would result in cell necrosis (24).  Garcia-Fuster et al. studied external and internal apoptosis pathways in prefrontal cortex of persons using methadone and heroin. Their findings showed that in such individuals these pathways were not activated in an abnormal manner. Instead, slowing or continuous manipulation of some parts of these pathways (downregulation cytochrome C and upregulation BCL-21) induces anti apoptosis activity (25).",
