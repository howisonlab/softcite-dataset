CTLs lyse infected or aberrant target cells by exocytosis of lytic granules containing the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of proteases termed granzymes. We show that effector CTL differentiation occurs in two sequential phases in vitro, characterized by early induction of T-bet and late induction of Eomesodermin (Eomes), T-box transcription factors that regulate the early and late phases of interferon (IFN) \u2425 expression, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate a critical role for the transcription factor Runx3 in CTL differentiation. Runx3 regulates Eomes expression as well as expression of three cardinal markers of the effector CTL program: IFN-\u2425 , perforin, and granzyme B. Our data point to the existence of an elaborate transcriptional network in which Runx3 initially induces and then cooperates with T-box transcription factors to regulate gene transcription in differentiating CTLs.",

Mice defi cient for both T-bet and Eomes in T cells have impaired ex-pression of cytolytic mediators, manifest poor cytolytic activity, and fail to control acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection ( 9 ). Nevertheless, the specifi c roles of T-bet and Eomes in clonal expansion and CTL diff erentiation have not yet been resolved: in particular, it is not known whether these transcription factors function redundantly to control eff ector CD8 + T cell diff erentiation, and whether they do so directly by targeting specifi c eff ector cytokine and cytolytic genes.",

Even after activation for 2 or 4 d, the cells showed poor cytolytic activity ( Fig. 1 F ), in striking contrast to their capacity for effi cient cytokine production ( Fig. 1 E ).

T-bet is induced quickly upon TCR stimulation and is required for early programming of cytokine production ( 17 ), whereas Eomes is induced later during diff erentiation and sustains IFN-\u2425 expression. Runx3 is required for Eomes and perforin expression, and both Eomes and Runx3 bind at the Prf1 locus; in contrast, perforin expression is unaff ected in T-bet -defi cient cells. T cells lacking Runx3 show decreased expression of IFN-\u2425 and granzyme B, and Runx3 also binds the promoter regions of the Ifng and Gzmb genes. Collectively, these results provide evidence for a complex transcriptional network in which Runx3 is a primary regulator of Gzmb expression but synergizes with T-bet and Eomes, respectively, to promote transcription of the Ifng and Prf1 genes.",

            "text": "To determine whether Runx3 controlled the expression of CTL eff ector genes through its induction of Eomes, we retrovirally expressed Runx3 and Eo-VP16 in CD8 + T cells from Runx3 \u03ea / \u03ea mice. Because of the limited number of CD8 + T cells in these mice, and because we saw no diff erence between Runx3 \u03ea / \u03ea CD8 + CD4 \u03ea SP and CD8 + CD4 + DP cells in our previous experiments, we used total Runx3 \u03ea / \u03ea CD8 + T cells without further fractionation as recipients for retroviral transduction. Reconstitution of Runx3 \u03ea / \u03ea CD8 + T cells with Runx3 restored expression of Eomes as well as perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-\u2425 ( Fig. 4, A and B ). In addition, Runx3 \u03ea / \u03ea T cells showed a jem.20081242/DC1). Strikingly, Runx3 \u03ea / \u03ea CD8 + T cells were strongly impaired in their ability to diff erentiate into eff ector CTLs, as judged by expression of perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-\u2425 ( Fig. 3 ). Compared with WT T cells, perforin mRNA and protein expression were essentially undetectable in Runx3 \u03ea / \u03ea T cells at day 6 of culture ( Fig. 3,  A and B ). Runx3 \u03ea / \u03ea T cells also had no detectable Eomes expression; in contrast, T-bet expression was unimpaired ( Fig. 3 A ). Furthermore, Runx3 was required for maximal production of IFN-\u2425 , but not TNF or IL-2, by CD8 + T cells restimulated at day 6 ( Fig. 3 C ).",

Because (a) Runx3 appeared necessary for Eomes induction ( Fig. 3 A ), (b) the kinetics of Eomes expression paralleled those of perforin expression ( Fig. 2 ), and (c) overexpression of Eo-VP16 in either WT or T-bet -defi cient T cells led to an increase in both perforin and IFN-\u2425 expression ( Fig. 2, B and D ), we asked whether CTL diff erentiation was also potentially regulated by a feed-forward loop involving these same two classes of Runx and T-box transcription factors. Specifi cally, we asked whether Runx3, which was necessary for Eomes induction, then cooperated with Eomes to regulate transcription of the effector CTL markers perforin, IFN-\u2425 , and granzyme B.

Additional experiments are needed to determine whether Eomes and Runx1 are also direct target genes of Runx3. compensatory up-regulation of Runx1, which was suppressed upon reconstitution with Runx3, indicating that Runx1 is a target of repression by Runx3. Notably, Eo-VP16 did not up-regulate perforin expression when expressed in Runx3 \u03ea / \u03ea cells, even though it restored the capacity to induce IFN-\u2425 expression upon TCR restimulation ( Fig. 4, A and B ).

T-bet is needed early to confer on activated CD8 + T cells the competence to produce IFN-\u2425 upon restimulation, but its function is less important at later times. Eomes, which is induced late and functions downstream of Runx3, may substitute for T-bet in promoting the acute expression of IFN-\u2425 in restimulated CTLs ( 8 ). Indeed, T-bet and Eomes both contribute to perforin expression in NK cells ( 8,26 ), and Eomes induces granzyme B as eff ectively as T-bet in developing Th2 cells 7; thus, the relative roles of these Tbox transcription factors vary depending on cell type.",

Granzyme B staining was specifi c relative to an isotype control (not depicted). Cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h. (F) FACS-based assay to measure cytolytic activity of P14 CD8 + T cells against EL4 targets loaded with 0 ( \u03ea ) or 1 (+) \u03bc M Gp33 peptide (effector-to-target ratio = 5:1). Percentage of Annexin V + (apoptotic) target cells in the CD8-negative EL4 target population (dot plots) was determined (histograms). Cytolytic activity was blocked by incubation with 2 mM EGTA (not depicted), confi rming involvement of the granule exocytosis (perforingranzyme B) pathway. Data are representative of at least fi ve (A -E) or three (F) independent experiments.",

(A) Protein expression in whole-cell extracts (day 6) was analyzed by immunoblotting. Overexpression of Eomes-VP16 cannot be detected with the Eomes antibody, as the C-terminal epitope is within the region that has been replaced with the VP16 transactivation domain. (B) Expression of granzyme B and IFN-\u2425 after culture for 6 d and restimulation for 4 h with PMA and ionomycin was determined by intracellular staining. The percentage of positively stained cells is shown above the gate; the mean fl uorescence intensity (MFI) of granzyme B staining for the total population is shown below the gate. The vertical gray lines indicate the MFI for WT GFP + cells. Results are representative of at least two independent experiments. (C) Schematic diagram of the transcriptional network involving Runx3 and T-box factors. T-bet is induced by TCR signals and is essential for early IFN-\u2425 expression. Runx3 is present in naive CD8 + T cells and represses Runx1 and induces Eomes, perforin, granzyme B, and IFN-\u2425 expression. Eomes may participate in sustaining late IFN-\u2425 expression, whereas Runx3 and Eomes (but not T-bet) may cooperate to activate perforin expression. The dotted line indicates the partial effect of T-bet defi ciency on Gzmb mRNA but not granzyme B protein expression.",
