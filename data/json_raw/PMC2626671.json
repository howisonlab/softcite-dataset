CTLs lyse infected or aberrant target cells by exocytosis of lytic granules containing the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of proteases termed granzymes. We show that effector CTL differentiation occurs in two sequential phases in vitro, characterized by early induction of T-bet and late induction of Eomesodermin (Eomes), T-box transcription factors that regulate the early and late phases of interferon (IFN) \u2425 expression, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate a critical role for the transcription factor Runx3 in CTL differentiation. Runx3 regulates Eomes expression as well as expression of three cardinal markers of the effector CTL program: IFN-\u2425 , perforin, and granzyme B. Our data point to the existence of an elaborate transcriptional network in which Runx3 initially induces and then cooperates with T-box transcription factors to regulate gene transcription in differentiating CTLs."

In vivo experiments have elucidated many critical parameters governing the development and evolution of primary CTL responses ( 3,4 ). In this study, we have used in vitro systems such as those developed to study CD4 + T cell diff erentiation to defi ne the molecular basis of eff ector CTL differentiation ( 5,6 ).",

T-bet is induced quickly upon TCR stimulation and is required for early programming of cytokine production ( 17 ), whereas Eomes is induced later during diff erentiation and sustains IFN-\u2425 expression. Runx3 is required for Eomes and perforin expression, and both Eomes and Runx3 bind at the Prf1 locus; in contrast, perforin expression is unaff ected in T-bet -defi cient cells. T cells lacking Runx3 show decreased expression of IFN-\u2425 and granzyme B, and Runx3 also binds the promoter regions of the Ifng and Gzmb genes. Collectively, these results provide evidence for a complex transcriptional network in which Runx3 is a primary regulator of Gzmb expression but synergizes with T-bet and Eomes, respectively, to promote transcription of the Ifng and Prf1 genes.",

Because (a) Runx3 appeared necessary for Eomes induction ( Fig. 3 A ), (b) the kinetics of Eomes expression paralleled those of perforin expression ( Fig. 2 ), and (c) overexpression of Eo-VP16 in either WT or T-bet -defi cient T cells led to an increase in both perforin and IFN-\u2425 expression ( Fig. 2, B and D ), we asked whether CTL diff erentiation was also potentially regulated by a feed-forward loop involving these same two classes of Runx and T-box transcription factors. Specifi cally, we asked whether Runx3, which was necessary for Eomes induction, then cooperated with Eomes to regulate transcription of the effector CTL markers perforin, IFN-\u2425 , and granzyme B.

Runx3 binds to promoters and putative regulatory regions of the latter three genes, suggesting a direct eff ect on gene expression. Additional experiments are needed to determine whether Eomes and Runx1 are also direct target genes of Runx3. compensatory up-regulation of Runx1, which was suppressed upon reconstitution with Runx3, indicating that Runx1 is a target of repression by Runx3.

T-bet is needed early to confer on activated CD8 + T cells the competence to produce IFN-\u2425 upon restimulation, but its function is less important at later times. Eomes, which is induced late and functions downstream of Runx3, may substitute for T-bet in promoting the acute expression of IFN-\u2425 in restimulated CTLs ( 8 ). Indeed, T-bet and Eomes both contribute to perforin expression in NK cells ( 8,26 ), and Eomes induces granzyme B as eff ectively as T-bet in developing Th2 cells 7; thus, the relative roles of these Tbox transcription factors vary depending on cell type.",
