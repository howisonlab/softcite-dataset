            "text": "Dolutegravir is the newest integrase inhibitor approved for HIV treatment and has demonstrated potent antiviral activity in patient populations with a broad range of treatment experience. This analysis aimed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir in treatment-naive patients and to evaluate the influence of patient covariates. METHODS A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using a nonlinear mixed effect modelling approach based on data from 563 HIVinfected, treatment-naive adult patients in three phase 2/3 trials who received dolutegravir (ranging from 10-50 mg once daily) alone or in combination with abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine. RESULTS The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir were adequately described by a linear one compartment model with first order absorption, absorption lag time and first order elimination. Population estimates for apparent clearance, apparent volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time were 0.901 l h-1 , 17.4 l, 2.24 h \u00c01 , and 0.263 h, respectively. Weight, smoking status, age and total bilirubin were predictors of clearance, weight was a predictor of volume of distribution and gender was a predictor of bioavailability. However, the magnitude of the effects of these covariates on steady-state dolutegravir plasma exposure was relatively small (<32%) and was not considered clinically significant. Race/ethnicity, HBV/HCV co-infection, CDC classification, albumin, creatinine clearance, alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase did not influence the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir in this analysis. CONCLUSIONS A population model that adequately characterizes dolutegravir pharmacokinetics has been developed. No dolutegravir dose adjustment by patient covariates is necessary in HIV-infected treatment-naive patients. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT \u2022 Dolutegravir is an HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor that has been developed for the treatment of HIV infection. \u2022 The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir have been characterized in healthy volunteers and treatment-naive, HIV-1 infected adult patients. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS \u2022 This article is the first description of the population pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir in treatment-naive, HIV-1 infected adult patients. The influence of patient covariates on the exposure of dolutegravir has been explored.",

Phase 3 studies in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced subjects demonstrated that DTG has sustained antiviral activity and desirable safety profiles in combination with various background therapies in HIV-infected adults [3,4]. Furthermore, in vitro experiments suggest that DTG retains activity against viral strains harboring major integrase resistance mutations selected for by both raltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG) [5], two previously approved integrase inhibitors. These findings have been confirmed in clinical studies demonstrating DTG's activity in subjects with resistance to RAL [6].",

Based on the known safety profile and PK/PD relationships for the antiviral activity of DTG, the likely range of DTG therapeutic effect encompasses these changes. Subgroup analysis on week 48 antiviral response in SPRING-2 demonstrated that there were no effects of gender and age on response [17]. Thus, the effects of these covariates are not considered clinically significant. Therefore, no DTG dose adjustment by these covariates is necessary. The final PK model indicated that mean (95% CI) CL/F was 16% (10%, 22%) higher in current smokers compared with non-smokers/former smokers. DTG is metabolized primarily by UGT1A1 with CYP3A4 as a secondary pathway. Tobacco smoking has been shown to induce hepatic CYP isozymes including 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 3A4 and possibly 2E1 [18][19][20][21][22], and it may also have the potential to induce UGT1A1 activity [22,23]. The reason for the higher CL/F of DTG seen in current smokers in this analysis may be related to the enzyme induction effect of tobacco smoking.",

Clearance is often lower in elderly people. The reason for the unexpected effect of age on DTG CL/F may be associated with decreased absorption of DTG with age. For highly protein bound molecules like DTG, reduction in protein binding capacity and decrease in plasma albumin concentrations, as commonly seen in the elderly, may have contributed to the increased CL/F with age [25]. In the current analysis, age was slightly but inversely correlated with baseline albumin. However, age in the model had a lower OFV than baseline albumin in the model, suggesting that the increase in CL/F with age cannot be fully attributed to the decrease in plasma albumin concentrations. Since the data in elderly subjects were limited in the current analysis (17 [3%] aged >55 years and 1 aged >65 years), additional data from elderly subjects may be warranted to understand further the PK of DTG in this population.",

There was a 35% higher CL/F for study ING111521 compared with the other two studies. The reason behind such a study difference is not fully understood. There may be factors in these studies that are not accounted for with the available covariates to explain this difference. Although study ING111521 was a DTG monotherapy study, and SPRING-1 and SPRING-2 were combination treatment studies, no difference in DTG PK was expected between subjects receiving monotherapy vs. combination therapy with ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC, as these NRTIs do not share and have no effect on the elimination pathways of DTG (UGT1A1 and CYP3A).

Dose as a continuous covariate was investigated but was not significant, and no difference was found when separate bioavailability was estimated for the 25 mg dose compared with the 50 mg dose. The reason for a higher oral bioavailability at the lower dose is possibly due to better dispersion of the tablet at lower tablet strength.    Population pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir in treatment-naive population IOV was assessed in the model which improved individual predictions. The estimated IOV on CL/F was 17%, which is quite similar to the estimated intra-subject variability based on phase 1 studies in healthy adult subjects. The IOV is probably due to variation in absorption, although day-to-day variability in metabolic enzyme activity (such as UGT1A1 or CYP3A4) may also contribute to the estimated IOV. Compared with the residual variability estimated from this analysis (26.5%), the magnitude of IOV is not considered significant and therefore of little clinical relevance. This also provided the reasonable justification for not including IOV in simulation, given the main focus of simulation in this analysis was the central tendency of DTG exposure among various subpopulations. DTG PK were similar between healthy and HIV-1 infected subjects. Based on analysis using pooled PK data following DTG 50 mg once daily (fasted and fed) in phase 1 studies, geometric means (CV%) of DTG AUC(0-\u03c4), C max and C \u03c4 were estimated at 49.1 \u03bcg ml -1 h (41%), 3.62 \u03bcg ml -1 (35%) and 1.05 \u03bcg ml -1 (56%), respectively (internal data).

No relationship between DTG exposure (AUC(0-\u03c4), C max and C \u03c4 ) and the safety endpoints was observed, except for serum creatinine and CRCL, which appeared to be correlated with DTG exposure. DTG is known to inhibit organic cation transporter, OCT2, which mediates the tubular secretion of creatinine in the proximal renal tubules [26]. The observed correlation between DTG exposure and serum creatinine/CRCL would be an expected finding based on OCT2 inhibition by DTG. However, given the magnitude of changes in these safety parameters, none of them was considered to be clinically significant, and therefore DTG dose adjustment by patient characteristics is not necessary in HIV-infected treatment-naive adult patients.",
