In contrast to other databases it is meant to contain a limited number of experiments and only those with very high-resolution and-accuracy data. MAPU 2.0 displays the proteomes of organelles, tissues and body fluids or conversely displays the occurrence of proteins of interest in all these proteomes. The new release addresses MS-specific problems including ambiguous peptide-to-protein assignments and it provides insight into general functional features on the protein level ranging from gene ontology classification to comprehensive SwissProt annotation. Moreover, the derived proteomic data are used to annotate the genomes using Distributed Annotation Service (DAS) via EnsEMBL services. MAPU 2.0 is a model for a database specifically designed for high-accuracy proteomics and a member of the ProteomExchange Consortium. It is available on line at http://www.mapuproteome.com.",

In order to make the data useful to the larger biomedical community, they have to be easily accessible via the web. Existing proteome databases have focused on different aspects of proteomic data capture and data mining. The PRIDE database, for example, was primarily developed as a vehicle to share proteomic experiments (3). The PeptideAtlas project, on the other hand, is mainly interested in collecting data on peptide fragmentation patterns as a tool for improving future proteomics experiments (4,5). In a similar vein, the Global Proteome Machine Database (GPMDB), collects tandem mass spectra with a view to improve peptide identification (6,7). These and other proteome databases are beginning to be connected in the ProteomExchange Consortium (8).",

To allow the peptide-based retrieval of high-accuracy proteomic data across projects in a scalable way, we changed the basic concept of the MAPU database completely. The main modifications are the combination of various proteomic sub-databases, of a modern programming environment (C# and .NET) allowing a rich graphical user experience, solving MS specific problems such as peptide-to-protein assignments, the inclusion of additional large-scale proteomic datasets, the detailed cross-reference to SwissProt annotations and two-way connection to EnsEMBL using Distributed Annotation Service (DAS) technology.",

The basic schema of the database has changed dramatically, and the new database version unifies all sub-databases by reassigning the measured peptides along with their corresponding data from each experiment to protein entries of an updated database version. The new architecture is based in part on concepts developed for the Phosphorylation Site Database [PHOSIDA; www.phosida.com (14,15)]. It allows the organism-specific retrieval of various cell-type and organelle associated proteomic data. The user can query the database organism-specifically by protein name, protein description, gene symbol, accession of the database used for identification [such as the International Protein Index (IPI) (16)], SwissProt accession identifier, protein sequence or peptide sequence ( Figure 1, left panel). If more than one protein entry matches with the submitted query string, MAPU 2.0 will list all relevant proteins and mark the ones identified in at least one proteomic experiment, in red ( Figure 1, middle panel). Clicking on one of the red highlighted entries leads to the result page ( Figure 1, right panel). If there is just a single match to the query, the web user will be guided directly to the result page describing the inquired protein. The left panel of the resulting web page displays investigated cell types and tissues. If the protein was detected in a certain sub-proteome, the corresponding button is highlighted (Figure 1, right panel). Otherwise, the image of the tissue or cell type is illustrated in light colors indicating the absence of the specified protein of interest. Clicking on one of the buttons on the left panel results in the complete listing of all peptides that have been measured in the selected cell type along with associated data such as peptide identification scores or identification scores for post-translational modifications (PTMs) ( Figure 2).",

The user is alerted to this problem by color highlighting the listed peptides: green indicates that the selected protein of interest has the maximum number of peptides in comparison to all other proteins that contain the same peptide, whereas blue indicates that there is another protein entry that contains the peptide and shows the same number of identified peptides in total. Red points to the occurrence of another protein, which shows a higher number of detected peptides in total and thus presents the more likely associated protein. When pointing the mouse to one of the corresponding 'occurrences' buttons, a blue colored pop-up box lists all protein entries that contain the given peptide along with the total number of containing peptides that have been identified (Figure 2).

This is the case for the organellar database (20) as well as the red blood cell database (21), as both datasets are exclusively protein-based and therefore cannot be mapped to MAPU 2.0 due to the lack of peptide information. MAPU 2.0 is based on a modern and scalable software architecture, namely C# and the ASP.NET technology. This allows MAPU 2.0 to share class libraries, with PHOSIDA (15). The concepts and web applications of MAPU 2.0 and PHOSIDA are very similar and show that very distinct proteomic databases can be built using shared components.",

For this purpose, we extracted measured peptides of each proteomic dataset and reassigned the peptide sequences to genes annotated in the EnsEMBL database (11). If a specified peptide matches with sequences of more than one translated gene, we assigned the peptide to the gene transcript that shows the highest number of matching peptides in total within the associated project. Therefore, the peptide-to-gene transcript assignment results one-to-one relationships reducing potential redundancy.  The genome annotation section is accessible via the 'notepad' button located next to the main 'web book' of MAPU 2.0 ( Figure 4). The user first selects a species of interest. The karyotype of the selected species is illustrated along with a link that connects to the EnsEMBL genome annotation webpage. Clicking of the displayed chromosomes generates a more detailed image of the chosen chromosome along with general information including chromosome length, number of known and predicted genes, quantity of occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and number of gene transcripts. Besides these annotations, which are derived from the EnsEMBL database, the number of gene transcripts that have been identified in MAPU 2.0 is indicated.",

Selecting one of the bin boxes pops up the EnsEMBL web page, showing a detailed view of the selected chromosome region. On the right hand side, the number of transcripts that have been detected in any of the uploaded projects is illustrated for each bin. Clicking on one of these bin buttons results in the listing of all identified gene transcripts along with the descriptions of the corresponding genes and exact localizations on the chromosome. Moreover, a link is provided for each gene transcript that connects to the EnsEMBL homepage displaying the full annotation of that transcript. In addition to the general annotation of the given gene transcript, the pop-up EnsEMBL page will show all peptides that have been identified via the MAPU 2.0 DAS source (12). Thus, whenever a web user requests the information provided by MAPU 2.0 on EnsEMBL, the data included in the MAPU 2.0 database are illustrated via the DAS/Proserver system (13). Clicking on one of the illustrated peptides yields a report of all the cell types that contain the peptides for this gene transcript. In addition to the MAPU 2.0 DAS source, we have also established a PHOSIDA DAS source providing all phosphorylation sites that have been unambiguously identified (Class 1 sites) (14), but also phosphosites that lack precise identification within the phosphorylated peptide sequence due to insufficient fragment information in MS/MS (ambiguous sites).",

It provides a user-friendly environment and several of its concepts are innovative and could be transferred to proteomic databases of a more general nature. We addressed MS-specific problems including ambiguous peptide-to-protein assignments by straightforward approaches such as color highlighting of given peptide sequences. In addition, we used the proteomic data that are integrated in MAPU 2.0 to annotate the genome via the DAS technology provided by the EnsEMBL project. MAPU 2.0 is becoming a member of the ProteomExchange Consortium, allowing its data to be exchanged with other databases.",

This will also bring particular opportunities and challenges. For instance, we believe that proteomic data is now sufficiently readily produced in high quality, that it does not make sense to store all proteomics results accompanying publications in central databases, particularly if the data was generated in 'one-off ' projects and with low resolution technology. Instead, reference proteomes should be measured with extremely high-accuracy and in dedicated state of the art facilities. We intend to further develop MAPU with a view to serve as a model database for such highaccuracy reference proteomes.",
