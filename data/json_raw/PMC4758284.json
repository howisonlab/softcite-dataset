            "text": "Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the tumor suppressor gene Hath1 is implicated in the development and progression of tumors and is verified to be downregulated in several types of tumor. However, the roles and precise molecular mechanisms of Hath1 in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remain to be elucidated. In the present study, two approaches were used to investigate the tumor-suppressing effect of Hath1 in cutaneous SCC. Firstly, the effect of inhibiting Hath1 expression with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) on tumor growth and apoptosis was investigated. KUMA5 cells were stably transfected with a plasmid expressing Hath1 shRNA (pGenesil-1-Hath1). Secondly, the anti-tumor effect of Hath1 was investigated in KUMA5 cells following transfection with pcDNA3.1-Hath1. The mRNA and protein expression of Hath1 was detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Cell proliferation in vitro was assessed using an MTT assay. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis. The results demonstrated that compared with the control groups, the expression of Hath1 was significantly reduced in the KUMA5/pGenesil-1-Hath1 cells and markedly increased in the KUMA5/pcDNA3.1-Hath1 cells. Cell proliferation was markedly increased in the KUMA5/pGenesil-1-Hath1 cells in a time-dependent manner; however, it was markedly inhibited in the KUMA5/pcDNA3.1-Hath1 cells. Flow cytometry revealed that apoptosis decreased in KUMA5/pGenesil-1-Hath1 cells and increased in KUMA5/pcDNA3.1-Hath1 cells. Downregulation of Hath1 expression promoted the proliferation and reduced the apoptosis of KUMA5 cells. By contrast, overexpression of Hath1 inhibited proliferation and induced the apoptosis of KUMA5 cells. These findings provide possible new strategies and therapeutic targets for the treatment and diagnosis of cutaneous SCC."

            "text": "Non-melanoma skin carcinoma is one of the most frequent types of tumor worldwide and includes two histological types: Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (1)(2)(3). Cutaneous SCC is the second most common cutaneous carcinoma and accounts for 20% of all types of cutaneous tumor (4)(5)(6). Previous studies have made significant progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis and development of cutaneous SCC (7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12). However, the incidence rates of patients with cutaneous SCC have been increasing rapidly each year, due to the lack of molecular targeted therapies and reliable molecular markers in early diagnosis. Therefore, novel molecular biomarkers and targeted therapeutic approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cutaneous SCC are urgently required.",

Hath1 was initially identified as a tumor suppressor gene in colon cancer (14). However, increasing evidence has revealed that Hath1 is not only a tumor suppressor in colon cancer (14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24), but is also downregulated and involved in the tumorigenesis of various other types of human cancer, including medulloblastoma (25,26), gastric carcinoma (27,28), intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (29), lung cancer (30,31) and Merkel cell carcinoma (32). Inherited or acquired defective mutants of Atoh were initially identified in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma by Leonard in 2002 (32). Deletion of Hath1 using retrovirus vectors led to the disruption of Sonic hedgehog signaling in the developing cerebellum and finally resulted in medulloblastoma formation (26). Bossuyt et al confirmed that the incidence of colonic polyps in mice lacking the Hath1 gene was 100% compared with that in wild type mice (16). Zhu et al found that Hath1 expression is downregulated in non-mucinous adenocarcinomas (19)(20)(21) and that Hath1 inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cells possibly through upregulating the expression of Muc2 and p27 and downregulating the expression of cyclin D1 (24).

However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies on the biological role of Hath1 in cutaneous SCC have been reported to date. Therefore, the current study predominantly focused on the biological function of the Hath1 gene. In order to examine the effects of the Hath1 gene on the growth, proliferation and apoptosis of cutaneous SCC, Hath1 was alternately silenced with short hairpin RNA (shRNA), or overexpressed using a recombinant eukaryotic expression vector carrying the Hath1 gene. KUMA5 human cutaneous squamous carcinoma cells were infected with pcDNA3.1-Hath1 or pGenesil-1-Hath1. Subsequently, cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by MTT assay and flow cytometry to provide further insight into the potential use of Hath1 for the targeted therapy of cutaneous SCC. Collectively, these data suggest that Hath1 may be a novel molecular target for the treatment of cutaneous SCC."

Total RNA was extracted from normal human cutaneous tissue using 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (cat. no. 15596-018; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was then synthesized using an ABI TaqMan one-step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents kit (cat. no. 4309109; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Based on the GenBank sequence (NC_000004.12), upstream and downstream primers were synthesized for Hath1 gene amplification. The restriction enzyme sites for BamHI and HindIII were added to the 5' end of each primer. Subsequently, the full-length Hath1 gene was amplified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) from the cDNA template with the primers containing the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. The PCR product was then ligated into the pMD18-T vector (cat. no. 6011; Takara Bio., Inc., Dalian, China), transformed and screened for positive clones. Following sequence verification, the correct sequence was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (cat. no.

The present study demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity of Hath1 in cutaneous SCC, using a variety of techniques, including overexpression of Hath1 and shRNA-mediated Hath1 silencing. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, Hath1 was successfully silenced or overexpressed. The expression level of Hath1 in pGenesil-1-Hath1-transfected cells was significantly decreased to 22% of the normal levels (P<0.05). Cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-Hath1 had significantly higher levels of Hath1 expression, which was ~3.9 times higher than the control groups (P<0.05). MTT assays demonstrated that the proliferation of KUMA5/pGenesil-1-Hath1-transfected cells was promoted in a time-dependent manner, however, proliferation was inhibited in KUMA5/pcDNA3.1-Hath1-infected cells. Furthermore, the apoptotic rate of the pGenesil-1-Hath1-transfected group significantly decreased. By contrast, the apoptotic rate of the KUMA5/pcDNA3.1-Hath1-infected group significantly increased. These experimental results demonstrated that overexpression of Hath1 could repress the proliferation of KUMA5 cells and promote apoptosis. However, shRNA-mediated Hath1 silencing enhanced the growth of KUMA5 cells and inhibited the apoptosis of KUMA5 cells.",

Zhu et al (20,21,24) and Leow et al (14) identified that overexpression of Hath1 inhibits proliferation of HT29 colon cancer cells through downregulation of cyclin D1 and upregulation of p27 and MUC2, a goblet cell differentiation marker. In a previous study, knockout of Hath1 was demonstrated to promote tumorigenesis in colorectal mouse models with intestine-specific deletion of Hath1 (18).   of four colon cancer cell lines, namely HT-29, LS17T, SW480 and SW620 with weak or absent expression of Hath1. In addition, the inhibition of cell proliferation by Hath1 was inversely proportional to the expression of Hath1 in these four colon cancer cell lines. However, instead of inducing apoptosis, an increase in tumor cell sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil was observed in one of the four colon cancer cell lines. By contrast, shRNA-mediated Hath1 gene silencing using retroviral vectors could significantly accelerate the growth rate of the normal rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC6 with suppressed growth by high expression of the Hath1 gene, which also confirmed the tumor suppressor activity of Hath1 (22). A previous study (38) demonstrated that retroviral-mediated Hath1 expression can significantly reduce human esophageal keratinocyte cell proliferation and induce marked expression of Barrett's esophagus markers Mucin-2 and Keratin-20. The results of the present study, which build on earlier studies (14,16,(20)(21)(22)24), confirm the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities of Hath1.",
