            "text": "Oxygen transport imposes a possible constraint on the brain's ability to sustain variable metabolic demands, but oxygen diffusion in the cerebral cortex has not yet been observed directly. We show that concurrent two-photon fluorescence imaging of endogenous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and the cortical microcirculation exposes well-defined boundaries of tissue oxygen diffusion in the mouse cortex. The NADH fluorescence increases rapidly over a narrow, very low pO 2 range with a p 50 of 3.4 \u00b1 0.6 mm Hg, thereby establishing a nearly binary reporter of significant, metabolically limiting hypoxia. The transient cortical tissue boundaries of NADH fluorescence exhibit remarkably delineated geometrical patterns, which define the limits of tissue oxygen diffusion from the cortical microcirculation and bear a striking resemblance to the ideal Krogh tissue cylinder. The visualization of microvessels and their regional contribution to oxygen delivery establishes penetrating arterioles as major oxygen sources in addition to the capillary network and confirms the existence of cortical oxygen fields with steep microregional oxygen gradients. Thus, two-photon NADH imaging can be applied to expose vascular supply regions and to localize functionally relevant microregional cortical hypoxia with micrometer spatial resolution.",

            "text": "A fundamental impediment to the current investigation of cortical function is the uncertain causality between changes in neural activity, cerebral blood flow, and tissue oxygenation under nonactivated and activated conditions (Raichle and Mintun, 2006). Thus, the physiological purpose that leads to the highly conserved response of increased cerebral blood flow to focally stimulated brain tissue (Roy and Sherrington, 1890) remains an enigma. Nevertheless, many contemporary neuroimaging studies rely exclusively on localizing the hemodynamic response. Although the total amount of oxygen transported to the brain exceeds the total consumed oxygen by a factor of B2.5 (Buchweitz et al, 1980), oxygen is distributed from the vasculature to the brain parenchyma solely by diffusion, with uncertainties regarding the functional relevance of perivascular tissue oxygen gradients (Thews, 1960a;Ndubuizu and LaManna, 2007) and oxygen diffusion times (Masamoto et al, 2007) for neurometabolic (Thompson et al, 2003;Masamoto et al, 2003) and neurovascular coupling (Buxton and Frank, 1997;Vafaee and Gjedde, 2000;Mintun et al, 2001;Gjedde, 2002).",

All mice were used at age 10 to 12 weeks. C57Bl6 and Eno2-YFP/ Cox8a mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1% to 1.5%) and ventilated through a facemask. FVB mice were anesthetized with ketamine (0.12 mg/g intraperitoneally) and xylazine (0.01 mg/g intraperitoneally) and ventilated through a tracheostomy using a small animal ventilator (SAR-830, CWE Inc., Woodland Hills, CA, USA) set at 100 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 0.3 to 0.4 mL. The body temperature was maintained using a water-flow heating pad (TP-500, Gaymar, Orchard Park, NY, USA) and a temperature controller (ACT1000, WPI Inc., Sarasota, FL, USA). The femoral artery was cannulated for measurements of systemic blood pressure (BLPR2/SYS-BP1, WPI Inc.) and blood gases (Ciba-Corning 238, GMI Inc., Ramsey, MN, USA).

Fluorescence was separated from the excitation light using a dichroic mirror/near-IR-blocking filter combination (FF665-Di01; FF01-680/SP, Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA) divided into two channels using a dichroic mirror (505DCXRU, Chroma, Rockingham, VT, USA), and bandpass filtered (NADH-Semrock FF460/80, YFP-Chroma 535/30ET, Texas-Reddextran-Semrock FF607/36). All optical bandpass filters are specified according to the manufacturer's convention 'center wavelength/filter bandwidth'. Two-photon microangiographies were taken from the pial surface down to layer IV using 1 mm z-steps. Concurrent two-photon imaging of NADH and the vasculature was performed at imaging depths ranging from 50 to 200 mm. The laser power after the objective was kept below 10 mW. To conduct fourcolor imaging of neurons, astrocytes, microvessels, and NADH in the cortex, we used transgenic mice with expression of YFP in a subset of cortical neurons (Jackson Labs, B6.Cg-TgN(Thy1-YFPH)2Jrs).

Extracellular recordings of the local field potential and the DC potential were obtained through patch pipettes (TW150F-4, WPI) with a tip diameter of 2 to 3 mm. The electrodes were filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid and placed in the imaging plane in cortical layer I at a depth of 50 to 100 mm. The local field potential signals were amplified using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), bandpass filtered at 1 to 100 Hz, and digitized at 20 kHz (Digidata 1320, Axon Instruments). For measurement of cerebral blood flow, we used a laser Doppler system, with a 1-mm needle probe (BLF21, Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA) that was placed above the barrel cortex. For direct oxygen measurements in layer I, we used customized Clark-type electrodes, with a fast response time and a 3 to 4 mm tip diameter (Unisense A/S, Aarhus, Denmark). These oxygen electrodes were calibrated before each experiment in saline equilibrated with room air (21% O 2 ) and a solution of ascorbate in NaOH (0% O 2 ).

            "text": "We first addressed the specificity of intrinsic tissue fluorescence of the mouse somatosensory cortex as a reporter for NADH. Using a combined multiphoton imaging and spectroscopy setup ( Figure 1A), we acquired fluorescence emission spectra from layer I on two-photon excitation at 710 nm. To minimize the interference from hemoglobin absorption, we took the spectra from tissue volumes that were free of large blood vessels. The bounded position of the intrinsic fluorescence spectrum ( Figure 1B, black plot, avg. \u00b1 s.d from six mice) between the spectrum of free, aqueous NADH ( Figure 1B, red plot) and the blue-shifted spectrum of NADH bound to mitochondrial malate-dehydrogenase ( Figure 1B, blue plot) shows that intracellular NADH in the neocortex exists in equilibrium between free and proteinbound molecules, in analogy to the hippocampal neuropil (Vishwasrao et al, 2005). The strong congruity of the spectra depicted in Figure 1B establishes that intrinsic signal is essentially pure pyridine nucleotide fluorescence with spectrally indistinguishable fractions from NADH and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). As NADH contributes B86% and NADPH contributes only B14% to the total tissue concentrations of the reduced pyridine nucleotides in the mouse cortex (Klaidman et al, 1995), the intrinsic tissue fluores-cence can be interpreted as predominately representing NADH and thus as a specific reporter for neural energy metabolism. As the next step, we calibrated the NADH fluorescence intensity in layer I as a function of tissue oxygenation by concurrent NADH imaging and Clark electrode oxygen measurements during experimentally induced hypoxemia ( Figure 1C). Controlled hypoxemia was induced by gradual reduction of the oxygen concentration in the ventilated gas mixture from 21% to 0%. The inverse relationship between NADH fluorescence and oxygen becomes obvious when plotting the tissue fluorescence as a function of the extracellular oxygen tension ( Figure 1D). The NADH fluorescence remained first unchanged, with decreasing tissue oxygen levels from 25 to 10 mm Hg and eventually exhibited an abrupt increase at extracellular tissue oxygen levels below 10 mm Hg. Our measurements of the oxygen dependence of NADH fluorescence in mouse cortex are consistent with previously published studies on mitochondrial metabolism in cultured cells. Wilson et al (1979a) reported that there is little change in intramitochondrial (NAD + /NADH) until very low oxygen tensions are reached. It was also reported that the respiratory rate is essentially independent of oxygen concentrations above 20 mM (B12 mm Hg), which is in full agreement with the flat slope of our calibration curve between 10 and 25 mm Hg. Mathematical modeling (Wilson et al, 1979b) suggested that mitochondrial (NAD + /NADH) may still be weakly dependent on oxygen concentration at higher concentrations throughout the entire physiological range up to 200 mM (B120 mm Hg), albeit with a slope much less than that noted below 10 mm Hg.",

The NADH fluorescence levels within the tissue patches were 48% to 58% elevated with respect to adjacent tissue with uniformly low NADH fluorescence. We could consistently unmask these tissue patches with short (20 seconds) episodes of mild hypoxemia that we induced by lowering the oxygen concentration in the ventilated gas mixture from 21% to 15% oxygen. Electrophysiological recordings under these conditions revealed a transient silencing of the spontaneous electrical activity with only minimal shifts of the DC potential (Supplementary Figure S1). The stability of the DC potential excludes pathological conditions like anoxic depolarization or spreading depression (Takano et al, 2007), as underlying causes for the observed NADH patches. Possible confounding effects of anesthesia were addressed by using two fundamentally different regimes (isoflurane or ketamine/xylazine). The NADH tissue patches were consistently observed under both regimens, and they did not respond to changes in anesthetic depth.",

These mice offer the unique opportunity to directly compare the distributions of NADH fluorescence and neuronal mitochondria in the same cortical region. In stark contrast to the described heterogeneities in the NADH tissue fluorescence, the spatial distribution of YFP fluorescence from neuronal mitochondria was homogenous, regardless of their location within the vascular bed ( Figure 2D). The even distribution of neuronal mitochondria described here is consistent with a regionally uniform metabolic rate for oxygen in layer I. In contrast, the sharply delineated, dark appearance of the cortical blood vessels in both the NADH and mitochondrial YFP fluorescence images can be attributed to the high two-photon absorptivity of hemoglobin (Clay et al, 2007).",

            "text": "To further delineate the apparent spatial relationship between NADH tissue patches and the microcirculation, we digitally superimposed pseudocolored arterioles (red in Figure 2E) and venules (blue in Figure 2E) over the raw NADH image (grayscale, Figure 2E). The montage highlights distinct circular indentations (yellow sketches) and linear borders (orange sketches) of the NADH tissue patches. These NADH tissue patches were always located in tissue areas distant to regional blood vessels, notably at greater distances to arterioles than to venules. We further conducted four-compartment fluorescence imaging of NADH ( Figure 3A), neuronal processes ( Figure 3B), astrocytes ( Figure 3C), and the vasculature ( Figure 3D) under resting conditions, with 21% inspired oxygen to investigate whether the NADH patches were related to the distribution of cellular elements in the neuropil of layer I. However, the superimposition of all four fluorescence channels ( Figure 3E) did not reveal any association of NADH patches to astrocytes or neuronal processes in layer I, whereas it confirmed their strong geometrical association with neighboring blood vessels ( Figures 3F-3H). The described geometry is instantly recognizable and consistent with an underlying relationship to oxygen supply from the vascular bed. Thus, the boundaries of the tissue patches could be related to the perimeter of oxygen diffusion from neighboring microvessels. We interpreted these tissue NADH patches as hypoxic (pO 2 r3.4 mm Hg) watershed areas and asked whether similar patterns could be observed in the physiologically activated brain.",

            "text": "Focal neural activity in the barrel cortex was induced by intermittent whisker stimulation using 20 second trains at 5 Hz and validated by recording of well-described neurovascular responses in layer I (Supplementary Figure S2), specifically bursts of local field potentials, the hemodynamic response, and the previously reported (Thompson et al, 2003;Masamoto et al, 2003) biphasic change in tissue oxygenation. We applied five intermittent 20 second trains separated by 2 minute-intervals during an 8-minute period. The microregional intensity distribution of the time-averaged NADH tissue fluorescence ( Figure 4A) in layer I appeared homogenous. However, we frequently observed evanescent, spatially confined NADH transients delineated by conspicuous circular borders. These microregional fluctuations emerged at various times during the stimulation period, some appeared spontaneously, whereas others were correlated with the applied stimuli. To quantitatively isolate such metabolically labile regions, we computed the s.d. for each pixel of the time series. The visualization of the s.d. ( Figure 4B) reveals a distinctively geometrical tissue pattern, which is consistent with two intersecting circles. Their boundaries are defined by the visible, steep transition from low to high s.d., and they effectively separate inner regions with stable NADH fluorescence from outer regions with fluctuating NADH fluorescence. To determine the radius R of the described tissue circles, we measured their radial pixel intensity values within a well-defined segment ( Figure 4C). Details of this complex measurement are provided in the Supplementary Text. We then fitted a sigmoidal function (red line in Figure 4D) to the radial intensity profile (blue symbols in Figure 4D) and used its inflection point, x o , as a definition of R. The boundaries of the two intersecting circles (yellow sketches in Figure 4E) are now objectively defined, with radii R of 43 and 68 mm, respectively. Two-photon microangiography revealed the crosssection of a solitary central blood vessel in each circle, here two arterioles (red pseudocolor in Figure  4E) with radii r of B6 and 13 mm, respectively.",

The influential concept of the Krogh tissue cylinder was proposed in 1919 as a mathematical description of radial oxygen diffusion from capillaries into skeletal muscle, and it has provided the groundwork for many subsequent models of tissue oxygen supply (Thews, 1960a;Popel, 1989;Foster et al, 1991). On the basis of the strong geometrical analogy to the Krogh cylinder, we hypothesized that boundaries between tissue regions with steady and fluctuating NADH fluorescence represent the perimeter of radial oxygen diffusion from the central blood vessel into the surrounding neuropil. In this scenario, the cylindrical NADH tissue boundary is the physical equivalent of the second boundary condition of the Krogh model, which is defined as the point where the microregional tissue pO 2 approximates the critical oxygen tension p 50 necessary to sustain mitochondrial respiration. In this transitional zone, minute fluctuations in vascular supply or microregional tissue utilization of oxygen will lead to toggling between zero-order and first-order oxygen metabolism with oscillations between low and high NADH fluorescence levels. Consequently, the radius R of the cylindrical NADH boundary must be defined by the competition between vascular oxygen delivery through diffusion and the tissue metabolic rate for oxygen. As the next step, we adapted the Krogh model for the rodent cortex.",

According to our interpretation, this implies radial oxygen diffusion distances of > 50 mm, which exceeds known intercapillary diffusion distances of r24 mm (Thews, 1960a). In other words, the central penetrating arteriole is implied as the sole oxygen source for the entire tissue cylinder and consequently any further vessels within the tissue cylinder must be absent. To test this strong prediction, we conducted high-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of the cerebral microvasculature encompassing cortical layers I to IV. Indeed, these reconstructions consistently revealed a complete absence of the otherwise dense cortical capillary network in the vicinity of penetrating arterioles ( Figures 6A-6D) extending over several hundred micrometers along the length axis of penetrating arterioles. The first branching point of penetrating arterioles into lower-order arterioles was typically observed in cortical layer IV ( Figures 6E and 6F). The radius of these capillarydepleted tissue cylinders was 53\u00b19 mm (avg.\u00b1s.d., n = 48). These vascular reconstructions unequivo-cally establish penetrating arterioles as major primary oxygen sources with large radial diffusion distances of > 50 mm. The congruity of the capillary-depleted tissue cylinders and the periarteriolar NADH-bounded tissue cylinders further confirms  1as a transfer function between tissue pO 2 and NADH tissue fluorescence, we can predict the ideal NADH fluorescence profile within the tissue cylinder.

(A-D) Maximum intensity projections of the microcirculation in the somatosensory mouse cortex consistently reveal the striking absence of the dense cortical capillary network in an elongated coaxial tissue cylinder in the vicinity of penetrating arterioles. The four shown horizontal projections were derived from four mice and range from cortical layers I to IV. Communicating and penetrating arterioles are pseudocolored in red, major venules in blue. The corresponding coronal (E) and sagittal (F) projections of the angiography stack shown in D confirm the full three-dimensional extent of the periarteriolar avascular tissue cylinder with a length of B350 mm until lower-order arterioles branch laterally off the penetrating arteriole.

This allowed us to directly test our interpretation of NADH tissue boundaries as oxygen diffusion boundaries by subjecting the mice to controlled hypoxemia. We therefore lowered the inspired oxygen concentration from 21% to 10% for a period of 2 minutes. The resulting drop of the pO 2 in the femoral artery from the physiological value of 108 \u00b1 9 to 49 \u00b1 11 mm Hg (avg. \u00b1 s.d., n = 6 mice) is sufficient to induce moderate hypoxia (Xu and LaManna, 2006) in the cerebral cortex. As predicted, moderate hypoxia led to an increase in NADH fluorescence, which was spatially highly heterogeneous. The first changes noted were the appearance of NADH tissue patches in tissue regions distant to blood vessels. These anoxic microwatershed zones gradually expanded towards perivascular tissue regions, unmasking numerous isolated pericapillary tissue cylinders ( Figure 7A). Accordingly, moderate tissue hypoxia exposed the much larger Krogh cylinder surrounding a penetrating arteriole which branches of a horizontally oriented surface arteriole ( Figures 7B-7D).",

The broad oxygen spans inferred from our observations ( Figure  7F) under normoxic conditions are in general agreement with the regional distribution of our direct polarographic oxygen measurements in layer I (Supplementary Figure S3) and with previous oxygen measurements (Ndubuizu and LaManna, 2007). However, we cannot directly relate polarographic measurements to inferred oxygen gradients because the exact three-dimensional location of the electrode tip with respect to nearby microvessels is unknown. Thus, direct electrode measurements cannot be assigned to a specific vascular supply region with certainty. A further assignment to a defined position within a given vascular supply region seem even more problematic, especially when considering the uncertainties regarding the sensitive volume of oxygen electrodes.",

We can further determine the average diffusion distances for each vessel type ( Figure 7I). Our numbers are in good agreement with direct measurements of surface (Vovenko, 1999) and perivascular (Duling et al, 1979) oxygen tensions of arterioles, venules, and capillaries in the mammalian brain. We observed capillary oxygen levels slightly below venous oxygen tension as has been reported previously (Vovenko, 1999). Possible explanations could be the existence of arterio-venous shunting in the cortical circulation or more likely a selection bias caused by the masking of pericapillary NADH gradients because of highly overlapping capillary oxygen supply regions in well-oxygenated tissue volumes (Wang and Bassingthwaigthe, 2001).",

We observed a considerable reduction of tissue oxygen spans (compare Figures 7F and 7G) and a drop of vascular pO 2 to 45\u00b116 mm Hg (avg.\u00b1s.d.) in arterioles, 10\u00b15 mm Hg in capillaries, and 10 \u00b1 6 mm Hg in venules ( Figure 7H). The drop of the inferred vascular pO 2 reached unambiguous significance levels (P50.001) with high statistical power ( > 0.99) for all three vessel types. We can further quantify the radial shrinkage of vascular supply regions ( Figure 7I) and diminished tissue oxygen gradients ( Figure 7J). Notably, complete tissue cylinders with diameters of B60 to 100 mm surrounding penetrating arterioles remain adequately oxygenated under hypoxemic conditions. This is illustrated in the example shown in Figure  7D. An implication with possible clinical relevance is that significant periarteriolar cortex volumes are not directly affected by moderate cortical hypoxia.",

Obviously, the Krogh model has limitations for primarily capillary networks with convoluted and asymmetric perfusion (Krogh, 1919;Fletcher, 1978). The concern is that capillary domains, which are a descriptive measure of capillary spacing, and associated capillary supply regions are not congruent (Wang and Bassingthwaigthe, 2001). Thus, a more uniform oxygen distribution would be expected, challenging the wide span of tissue oxygen levels as predicted by the Krogh model. However, refined mathematical descriptions with objectively measured vascular geometries and flow relationships are frequently beyond analytical solutions and have not yet afforded a significantly improved correlation with experimental measurements (Thews, 1960a;Fletcher, 1978;Mintun et al, 2001). Indeed, numerous studies confirm highly nonuniform oxygen distribution in the cortex, and it has been suggested that microregional oxygen gradients provide a more appropriate representation of the actual cortical oxygenation in contrast to regionally averaged oxygen tensions (Ndubuizu and LaManna, 2007).",

This difficulty is amplified by the low two-photon absorption crosssection of NADH (0.07 GM at 710 nm), which is 1/100 to 1/1000 the magnitude of conventional fluorophores (Kasischke et al, 2004).

            "text": "For example, the possibility that mitochondria sense a declining oxygen tension and directly or indirectly trigger a blood flow increase (Gjedde, 2002) is in agreement with recent studies that have posited a regulatory role for the redox state of neural cells on cerebral blood flow (Ido et al, 2004;Vlassenko et al, 2006). The cellular redox state is determined by the cytosolic NADH/NAD + ratio, which exists in near-equilibrium with the intracellular lactate/pyruvate ratio. Thus, the proposed mechanism is that increased cytosolic NADH will increase the electron transfer from NADH to oxidized enzymes in signaling pathways that activate constitutive nitric oxide synthase to increase cerebral blood flow. Under hypoxic conditions, cytosolic NADH will be maximally elevated because of increased anaerobic glycolysis and cessation of its reoxidation to NAD + by mitochondrial electron shuttling. In this scenario, microregional tissue patches with elevated NADH levels would activate signaling cascades, which increase cerebral blood flow with a subsequent increase in microregional tissue oxygen levels, ultimately linking tissue metabolic states to the hemodynamic response.",
