Material and Methods: The viability, cell cycle, and morphology of LSC2 cells were analyzed after exposure to several different concentrations of Bis-GMA. The recovery of viability of Bis-GMA exposed cells was also analyzed in the condition without Bis-GMA. Further, penetration of Bis-GMA to dentin disc was examined using isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: There was a concentration-dependent decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in cell number in the sub-G1 population after exposure to Bis-GMA. Furthermore, the cells showed typical characteristics of apoptotic cells after the exposure to high concentration of Bis-GMA. In contrast, cells exposed to lower concentrations of Bis-GMA recovered their viability after being cultured without Bis-GMA. We also found that Bis-GMA is capable of penetrating 1-mm-thick dentin discs, though the penetrated concentration was lower than that showing cytotoxicity. Conclusion: These results suggest that Bis-GMA has cytotoxic effects, though dental pulp exposed to lower concentrations is able to recover their viability when Bis-GMA is removed.",

We cultured surviving cells after exposure to Bis-GMA in the normal medium without Bis-GMA, and found that the cells exposed to 0.01, 0,02, and 0.03 mmol/L of Bis-GMA showed the recovery of the cell proliferation, whereas those exposed to 0.04 mmol/L of Bis-GMA did not recover their proliferation. In addition, cell-cycle of surviving cells after exposure to 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 mmol/L of Bis-GMA returned to the same level as the control. These results suggest that even after the exposure to Bis-GMA, LSC2 cells have an ability to recover their viability when the concentration of Bis-GMA is low, whereas the cells exposed to high concentration of Bis-GMA lose such recovery ability.",
