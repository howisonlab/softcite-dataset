Methods. The CT scans of 100 patients were retrospectively evaluated. The anatomic relationships between the intraorbital structures and paranasal structures were measured using multiplanar reconstruction of the CT scan. Results. The mean distances from the medial orbital floor (MOF) to the intraorbital structures were measured at the depth of the anterior ethmoid (AE), basal lamella (BL), and midportion of posterior ethmoid (PE) in the coronal planes respectively. The mean distances from the MOF to the medial rectus muscle and inferior rectus muscle at the depth of AE were approximately 8 mm and those distances in the BL and PE decreased rapidly. The mean distances from the MOF to the infraorbital nerve at the depth of the AE and BL were approximately more than 10 mm. The mean distances from the vertical axis, which passed through the MOF, to the superior oblique muscle and optic nerve at the depth of the PE were approximately 5 mm medially and 1 mm laterally. In addition, the mean distance from the midline to the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle was approximately 15 mm. Conclusions. Those measurements provide spatial information on the placements of the extraocular muscles within the orbit. The measurements will contribute to the avoidance of orbital complications during sinus surgery."

Diplopia is one of the major orbital complications, and diplopia after ESS is usually caused by extraocular muscle (EOM) damage due to direct muscle injury [3].

In addition, there is a reported case of SO palsy that developed after frontal sinus minitrephine [5].",

All scanning was performed at constant window level and width settings of 300 and 330 H, because every change in the window level and width settings resulted in deviating values with respect to the muscle size on CT scan. The coronal reconstructions were modified using 3D-DOCTOR software (Able Software Co., Lexington, MA, USA), so that the nasal floor in the coronal and sagittal planes was horizontal. Sequential coronal planes were observed using 3D-DOCTOR software and simultaneous multiplanar reconstructions in bone algorithm format were reconstructed in the axial and sagittal planes. The positions of the coronal plane on which the measurements were taken were defined as the AE (anterior wall of bulla ethmoidalis that was removed first during anterior ethmoidectomy), BL (the basal lamella through which posterior ethmoidectomy was performed), and PE (the midportion of the posterior ethmoid sinus in the sagittal plane) in order to evaluate the intraorbital structures in view of the ethmoidectomy [11]. Through multiplanar reconstructions, the coronal planes that were equivalent to the positions of the AE, BL, and PE were identified exactly.",

The distances from the MOF to the SO and distances from the vertical line to the medial margin of the SO were measured at the depth of the BL and PE except the AE because the SO in coronal plane at the depth of the AE was tiny and ill-defined. The distances from the lamina papyracea (LP) to the MR and distance from the orbital floor to the IR were measured in the coronal planes at the depth of the AE because of increased width of the extraconal fat pad between the EOM and orbital wall adjacent to the AE (Fig. 1).",

These characteristics could provide even the most inexperienced surgeon with reliable information to find all of the paranasal sinuses and orbital structures. Because the MOF is a safe distance from the optic nerve, orbital roof, and sphenoid sinus roof, the surgeon can determine the surgeon's approximate location within the ethmoid sinus and operate in a zone of confidence [6]. In this study, the MOF was used as an anatomic reference point, and the relationships between intraorbital structures and the MOF were evaluated in the coronal plane. The distances from the MOF to the MR and IR at the depth of the AE were approximately 8 mm, and those distances at the depth of the BL and PE decreased markedly. In addition, the shortest mean distance from the orbital wall to the MR and IR at the depth of the AE was approximately 3 or 4 mm, and those structures were attached to the orbital wall behind the BL. During anterior ethmoidectomy and widening of the Fig. 4. Multiplanar reconstruction of the computed tomography scan and measurements regarding the trochlea of the SO. To evaluate the relationship between the surrounding structures and the trochlea, the coronal, axial, and parasagittal planes were observed. The red line and yellow line in the axial plane meant the position of the sagit tal plane and coronal plane separately and the blue line in the coro nal plane meant the level of the axial plane. The distance (a) was the horizontal distance between the midline and trochlea and well identified in axial (A) and coronal (B) planes. In the parasagittal plane (C) that was located at the midpoint of the frontal sinus opening, an imaginary point (P) that was parallel to the trochlea in position and level was drawn. The distance (b) was the vertical distance from P to the frontal beak. The distances (c) and (d) were the anteroposteri or distances from P to the anterior frontal sinus wall and frontal beak, separately. SO, superior oblique muscle; T, trochlea. antrostomy, the EOM would be difficult to injure with penetration of the LP or orbital floor with a sickle knife or cutting forceps, because there is some distance from the orbital wall to the EOM at the depth of AE. However, the distance between the MOF and EOM in BL and PE decreased rapidly. In particular, the mean horizontal distance from the MOF to the IR was approximately -1 mm, which meant that the medial margin of the IR passed over the vertical axis of MOF medially. Considering these results, the injury of the LP at the depth of the PE can cause injury of the EOM, and posterior ethmoidectomy must be cautiously performed even in the inferior portion of the posterior ethmoid sinus [3]. During ethmoidectomy, failure to correctly identify the LP can misdirect the surgeon with disastrous consequences for the patient, and the recognition of the medial bulging of the LP in the ethmoid sinus is important to prevent injury of the LP.

The mean horizontal distances from the vertical axis to the SO at the depth of the BL and PE were approximately 5.1 mm. The mean horizontal distances from the vertical axis to the ON at the depth of the AE and BL area were similar (5.6 mm and 4.8 mm), but the mean horizontal distance from the vertical axis to the ON at the depth of the PE was 1.0 mm. The range of this measurement at the depth of the PE was from -2.0 mm to 3.9 mm. These results meant that the ON at the depth of the PE was located near the MOF or, even, medial to the vertical axis of the MOF. Considering the distances from the vertical axis of the MOF to the SO and ON, we assumed that posterior ethmoidectomy should be performed more medially, relative to the vertical axis of the MOF; otherwise, penetration of the LP could occur and lead to injury of the ON as well as the EOM. The ION is a branch of the trigeminal nerve, continues along the orbital floor from the pterygopalatine fossa to the anterior wall of the maxilla, and appears on the face through the infraorbital foramen [14]. The ION is used as the landmark for endoscopic orbital decompression and endoscopic approach of the pterygopalatine fossa [15,16]. In our study, the horizontal distances from the MOF to the ION at the depth of the AE and BL were approximately more than 10 mm. Those results could support the concept that it would be difficult to injure the ION by orbital floor removal in endoscopic orbital decompression [15].",

            "text": "Frontal sinus disease, which was typically managed with external procedures, is now usually managed endoscopically. Despite endoscopic advances, an external procedure or combined internal-external approach may still be required. Although the position of the trochlea is not usually considered when designing an incision or entering the frontal sinus during an external procedure such as a frontal sinus mini-trephine or an osteoplastic flap, the location of the skin incision and tearing of the underlying periosteum are critical to the trochlea damage causing the SO palsy [5]. It was known that the damage to the trochlea could occur as the periosteum is elevated from bone or prolonged traction on soft tissue near the trochlea. The position of trochlea is located in close proximity to the supraorbital rim and the soft tissue thickness overlying the supraorbital rim is approximately 6 mm [19]. A highly vascular sheath which meets the need for repair of \"wear and tear\" surrounds the trochlea and the tendon of SO. The skin incision which may be located in more laterally than the periosteal incision would cause prolonged or inappropriate traction on soft tissue and direct injury of the trochlea and vascular sheath. However, there is little description regarding the position of the trochlea in frontal sinus surgery. Based on the fact that the trochlea lie on the superior wall of the orbit, which is surrounded by the frontal sinus, the relationships between the trochlea and frontal sinus were evaluated on coronal, axial, and sagittal plane. Considering that placing the skin incision more medially reduces the risk of potential damage [5], our results showed that the surgeon could perform the skin incision safely within approximately 1.5 cm from the midline during external frontal sinus surgery. In addition, the frontal beak which could be identified in the internal approach could supplement the limitation of the facial midline which is likely to be affected by the anatomy of the nasal bones and cartilage and vary considerably among ethnicities and individuals [20]. These measurements, which located the exact position of the trochlea in the frontal sinus using the midline and frontal beak, could help predict the position and avoid injury of the trochlear due to inadvertent tearing of the underlying periosteum during an external procedure [5].",

Considering these results, anatomic changes of the aging orbital fat could affect the relationship between the intraorbital structures and anatomic landmarks. In this study, the distance from the EOM to the orbital wall at the depth of the AE increased with age and the oth-er measurements showed no correlation with age. Since the orbital cavity is filled with orbital fat and is surrounded by orbital bone except the anterior portion, the globe and ON would be pushed anteriorly and move superiorly and laterally from the orbital wall. Those characteristics of the orbital cavity could influence on the distances from the EOM to the orbital wall at the depth of the AE.
