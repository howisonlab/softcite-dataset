When the ABCD form is non-minimal, the conditions in the literature are not necessary for the existence of a VAR representation of the observables. In this paper we present necessary and sufficient conditions that are valid in general, and hence can be applied to minimal and non-minimal ABCD forms. If the state space form is minimal, our conditions coincide with those in the literature. These results also clarify that it is possible to have unstable eigenvalues together with a (possibly finite) VAR representation of the observables.

In the following, we refer to the linear state space form as the ABCD form. When the number of shocks is equal to the number of observables and the matrix that loads the former into the latter is non-singular, the ABCD form is called square. We observe that the ABCD form of the solution dynamics need not be minimal, i.e. it may involve a non-minimal number of state variables. This is illustrated for example in Komunjer and Ng (2011), who show that the state space solutions in Christiano et al.

(2008). Conditions for the VAR to be of finite order are given in Ravenna (2007), where a 'unimodularity condition' is proposed as a check. This condition consists in the unimodularity of the matrix polynomial I \u2212 Fz, z \u2208 C, 2 or equivalently in the nilpotency of F, see Franchi and Vidotto (2013).",

In fact, when F is unstable, (I \u2212 Fz) \u22121 has poles in the (closed) unit disc and thus it is non-regular, but those singularities may be absent from C(I \u2212Fz) \u22121 B due to the presence of B and C.

One then has P \u03bb u ,0 = \u03b2 \u22a5 \u03d5\u03b1 \u22a5 = 0, where \u03b1 \u22a5 , \u03b2 \u22a5 are bases of the orthogonal complements of the column spaces spanned by \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03d5 = 0, and hence C P \u03bb u ,0 B = C\u03b2 \u22a5 \u03d5\u03b1 \u22a5 B = 0. Because rank(C\u03b2 \u22a5 ) = rank(\u03b1 \u22a5 B) = n x \u2212 r imply \u03d5 = 0, it must be that rank(C\u03b2 \u22a5 ) < n x \u2212 r and/or rank(\u03b1 \u22a5 B) < n x \u2212 r . Next use the projection identities I = \u03b1\u1fb1 +\u1fb1 \u22a5 \u03b1 \u22a5 = \u03b2\u03b2 + \u03b2 \u22a5\u03b2 \u22a5 , where\u0101 = a(a a) \u22121 , and write"
