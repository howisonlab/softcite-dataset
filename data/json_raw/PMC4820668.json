            "text": "Background: after the great east Japan earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, radioactive elements were released from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear Power Plant. Based on prior knowledge, concern emerged about whether an increased incidence of thyroid cancer among exposed residents would occur as a result. Methods: after the release, Fukushima Prefecture performed ultrasound thyroid screening on all residents ages \u226418 years. the first round of screening included 298,577 examinees, and a second round began in april 2014. We analyzed the prefecture results from the first and second round up to December 31, 2014, in comparison with the Japanese annual incidence and the incidence within a reference area in Fukushima Prefecture. Results: the highest incidence rate ratio, using a latency period of 4 years, was observed in the central middle district of the prefecture compared with the Japanese annual incidence (incidence rate ratio = 50; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 25, 90). the prevalence of thyroid cancer was 605 per million examinees (95% ci = 302, 1,082) and the prevalence odds ratio compared with the reference district in Fukushima Prefecture was 2.6 (95% ci = 0.99, 7.0). in the second screening round, even under the assumption that the rest of examinees were disease free, an incidence rate ratio of 12 has already been observed (95% ci = 5.1, 23). Conclusions: an excess of thyroid cancer has been detected by ultrasound among children and adolescents in Fukushima Prefecture within 4 years of the release, and is unlikely to be explained by a screening surge."

Furthermore, internal comparisons were intrinsically underestimated compared with external comparisons because the reference of internal comparisons was also influenced by the exposure. in particular, among seven cancer cases observed in the reference district (Figure), four were observed in Sukagawa city, which is usually included in the middle area as half of the city had a high air dose rate. if we excluded Sukagawa city from the reference, prevalence of the reference decreased to 170 per million.

Furthermore, we could infer a possibility that exposure doses for residents were higher than the official report or the dose estimation by the World Health Organization, 4 because the number of thyroid cancer cases grew faster than predicted in the World Health Organization's health assessment report. 5 Note added in editing: additional new data were released from Fukushima Prefecture on May 18, 2015, and two thyroid cancer cases from the first round of screening and seven cases from the second round of screening were added to the results presented in this article. the irr of external comparison with a 3-year latency in the second round of screening increased to 13.7 (95% ci = 7.7, 23).
