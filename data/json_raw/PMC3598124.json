M Ma at te er ri ia al l a an nd d m me et th ho od ds s: : The measurements of 81 scapulae included morphological length and width, maximal width and length projection of the scapular spine, and width and length of the glenoid cavity. The width-length scapular and glenoid cavity indices were calculated. In addition to standard anthropometric measurements three other dimensions were defined and collected for every SSN: maximal depth (MD), superior (STD) and middle (MTD) transverse diameters. R Re es su ul lt ts s: : The analysis of the measurements allowed us to distinguish five types of SSN. Type I (26%) had longer maximal depth than superior transverse diameter. Type II (3%) had equal MD, STD and MTD. In type III (57.6%) superior transverse diameter was longer than maximal depth. In type IV (7.4%) a bony foramen was present. Type V (6%) was without a discrete notch. Types I and III were divided into two subtypes: A (MTD was longer than STD) and B (MTD < STD). Distribution of the suprascapular notch types in both sexes was similar. However, MD, STD and MTD were significantly higher in males. The superior transverse suprascapular ligament was completely and partially ossified in 7.4% and 24.7% respectively. C Co on nc cl lu us si io on ns s: : The presented classification of the suprascapular notch is simple, easy to use, and based on specific geometric parameters which allow one to clearly distinguish five types of these structures. All dimensions of SSN were significantly higher in males than in females.",

            "text": "Suprascapular nerve entrapment is characterized by pain in the posterolateral region of the shoulder, atrophy of the infra-and supraspinatus muscles and weakness of the arm's external rotation and abduction. Approximately 1-2% of all shoulder pain is caused by this syndrome, and therefore can be easily overlooked in the differential diagnoses of shoulder discomfort [1][2][3]. Suprascapular nerve entrapment was first described by Kopell and Thompson in 1959 [4]. They reported that abduction or horizontal adduction of the shoulder exerted traction on the suprascapular nerve (SN), which led to its compression against the superior transverse scapular ligament (STSL). The main site of compression of the suprascapular nerve (SN) was the suprascapular notch (SSN), which was located at the superior border of the scapula, just medial to the base of the coracoid process [1,5].",

All scapulas were fixed with an adjustable clamp and ring stand at the same distance from the camera. After digital photographic documentation was obtained, three dimensions of the suprascapular notch were measured using MultiScanBase v.14.02 software (Computer Scanning System II, Warsaw, Poland). Multi-ScanBase v. 14.02 is a professional program whose functions include visualization, archiving, processing and analysis of images, with particular emphasis on measurement functions. Its advantage is automation of the process of analysis, even for poor quality images, allowing measurements of distance, density, surface area, and angle. This software has been widely used in some research, e.g. measurement of points on the mandible of common shrew [11], measurements of Daphniola Radoman shell morphometry [12], measurements of the diameters and density of vessels [13,14], and enabling manual karyotyping [15]. According to the anthropometric rules (Koszelev classifications and Olivier classifications) describing sexual dimorphism, all scapulas were divided into three groups: female, male and non-classified [9]  (Table I).",

            "text": "The present study aimed to establish a new method of classifying the suprascapular notch (SSN) morphology, which, contrary to existing methods, is simple, easy to use, and based on specific geometric parameters that clearly distinguish each type. Based on this classification, the frequency of each type of SSN in females and males was described. To our knowledge, the literature contains no similar study on this subject based on anthropometric evaluation. The type of notch might then be considered in diagnosing the syndrome. The projection in which the SSN is visualized clearly is the anteroposterior projection with the X-ray tube angled 15-30\u00b0caudally [28]. In conclusion, using MultiScanBase v.14.02 software for measurements and typing suprascapular notches, we were able to establish a precise classification of SSN variations, and also, for the first time, present their distribution in female and male scapulas.",
