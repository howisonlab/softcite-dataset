The present evaluation investigated the association between QRS duration (<150 vs. \u2265150 ms) and QRS morphology (left bundle brand block [LBBB] vs. non-LBBB) and long-term prognosis of a large cohort of unselected heart failure patients treated with CRT according to contemporary guidelines. Methods and results Of 973 heart failure patients treated with CRT (mean age 66.1 AE 9.8 years, 76% male), 658 patients (68%) showed QRS duration \u2265150 ms, and 772 patients (79%) had LBBB configuration. Compared with patients with QRS duration <150 ms, patients with QRS duration \u2265150 ms had less frequently ischaemic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation and showed larger left ventricular volumes and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. Compared with patients with non-LBBB configuration, patients with LBBB morphology were younger, less often males and less often had ischaemic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. On multivariable analysis, after correcting for relevant clinical and echocardiographic variables, LBBB morphology was significantly associated with better survival [hazard ratio (HR) 0.737; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.584-0.931; P = 0.010], whereas there was no statistically significant association between QRS duration \u2265150 ms and survival (HR 0.889; 95% CI 0.726-1.088; P = 0.252). Conclusions In this large population of heart failure patients treated with CRT, QRS morphology was independently associated with long-term survival. The association between QRS duration and long-term survival was not statistically significant.",

            "text": "Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established therapy for heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF \u226435%) and prolonged QRS duration (\u2265120 ms) leading to important improvements in left ventricular (LV) function and prognosis. [1][2][3][4] However, the individual prognostic benefit is not consistent, and selection of patients who will benefit from CRT remains challenging. Sub-analyses from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses pointed out that QRS duration and morphology are relevant for prognosis of patients treated with CRT. [5][6][7][8][9] Patients with shorter QRS duration and/or non-left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology appear to benefit less than patients with longer QRS duration and/or LBBB morphology. [5][6][7][8][9] However, the patients included in randomized trials with non-LBBB configuration represent a minority (5-30%), and approximately one third has a QRS duration between 120-150 ms. [1][2][3][4] In addition, the impact of QRS duration and morphology on CRT outcomes of selected patients included in randomized trials (frequently excluding patients with atrial fibrillation or associated comorbidities) may differ from unselected populations. A large registry has demonstrated that patients with QRS duration >150 ms, and LBBB morphology had the most benefit from CRT, while the prognostic benefit of patients with shorter QRS duration or non-LBBB configuration remained controversial. 10 To provide further evidence in this important domain, the current evaluation investigated the association between QRS duration (<150 vs. \u2265150 ms) and QRS morphology (LBBB vs. non-LBBB) and long-term prognosis of a large cohort of unselected heart failure patients treated with CRT according to contemporary guidelines.",

All-cause mortality together with heart transplantation and LV assist device (LVAD) implantation was the composite primary endpoint. Survival follow-up data were retrieved from municipality registries. Data of patients lost at follow-up were considered up to the last date of follow-up.

            "text": "The aforementioned separate analyses showing that QRS duration and morphology are important determinants of clinical benefits of CRT have led to the investigation of the interaction between QRS duration and morphology and its effects on CRT outcomes. 5,10,23,24 The sub-analysis of the RAFT trial (after excluding patients with ventricular pacing and permanent atrial fibrillation) showed that regardless the QRS duration, patients with LBBB morphology who were randomized to CRT with defibrillator function showed a reduction in the rates of the primary outcome (composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization) (HR 0.640; 95% CI 0.524-0.781; P < 0.001). 5 In addition, there was a continuous relationship between QRS duration and greater benefit from CRT is these patients. In contrast, patients with non-LBBB morphology allocated to the CRT arm showed a clinical benefit only when the QRS duration was 160 ms or longer (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.96; P = 0.033). 5 In addition, an individual patient meta-analysis on data from 3872 patients randomized in five clinical trials showed that patients with LBBB morphology exhibited larger benefit from CRT than patients with non-LBBB morphology, although the difference was not statistically significant. 23 Importantly, QRS duration was significantly associated with reductions in all-cause mortality and the rates of the composite endpoint, particularly when QRS duration exceeded 140 ms. 23 Based on this evidence, current guidelines have modified the recommendations and consider CRT a class I indication for heart failure patients with LBBB morphology (regardless the QRS duration) and class IIa for patients with non-LBBB and QRS duration \u2265150 ms and IIb for non-LBBB and QRS duration between 120-150 ms. 13 However, it is important to note that these observations of substudies and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials include selected patients and may not represent the 'realworld' patients being treated with CRT. Data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry, which included 24 169 patients aged 65 years or more who underwent CRT implantation, showed that the adjusted risk of 3 year mortality was lowest for the patients with LBBB and \u2265150 ms QRS duration (20.9%) and highest for the patients with non-LBBB and <150 ms QRS (32.3%). 10 There were no statistically significant differences in the adjusted risk of all-cause mortality between the groups of patients with LBBB configuration and QRS duration <150 ms (26.5%) and the patients with non-LBBB configuration and QRS duration \u2265150 ms (30.7%). Therefore, it seems that patients with LBBB morphology and patients with wider QRS complex are more likely to benefit from CRT. These results are extended to a younger population in the present study, which demonstrates that QRS morphology but not duration is independently associated with long-term survival. Probably, the smaller patient groups have precluded us from observing significant differences between subgroups based on QRS morphology and duration. However, since these registries did not include a control group of patients who did not undergo CRT implantation, the efficacy of CRT could not be compared, and therefore, conclusions regarding the survival benefits of CRT in patients with non-LBBB morphology and QRS duration between 120 and 149 ms remain unclear.",

However, the present study extends the results to a younger unselected population compared with previous series. 10 In addition, comparisons between patients undergoing CRT implantation vs. patients who were medically treated or received a conventional dual-chamber ICD were not possible. Furthermore, beyond QRS duration and morphology, previous study has demonstrated the relevance of other ECG parameters (PR interval, QRS axis, amplitude, and durations of each component of the QRS complex, QRS notching, QRS hieroglyphs that suggest myocardial scar) in predicting CRT response. 25,26 These parameters were not considered in the present study.",
