Overview of Literature: Vitamin D has a major role in musculoskeletal system health maintenance. Recently, studies on degenerative diseases of the spine have shown a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients undergoing spine surgery. Methods: Serum levels of 25(OH)D were determined by an electrochemiluminescence detection assay. The other variables were determined through relevant questionnaires, and the data was analyzed through analysis of variance, t-test, chi-square and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 110 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean serum level of 25(OH)D was 27.45\u00b118.75 ng/mL, and 44.5% of patients showed vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D<20 ng/mL), with an additional 17.3% of patients having a serum level of 25(OH)D that was insufficient (20\u226425(OH)D<30 ng/mL). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly higher in the younger age group compared to the older age group (p<0.001) and the ones without a history of taking vitamin D supplements (p=0.013). Compared to men, women showed significantly higher levels of vitamin D (p=0.029). Conclusions: A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is seen in patients with degenerative diseases of the spine. On the other hand, the conventional risk factors such as old age or female sex alone did not seem to be sufficient in determining the likelihood of deficiency. Thus, it is recommended that vitamin D deficiency prevention strategies comprise a broader spectrum of the population through which such degenerative diseases and their consequences may be prevented or delayed.",

It has been shown that vitamin D is involved in proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of chondrocytes [1], synthesis of proteoglycans-making up the matrix of intervertebral discsand also in regulation of plasma sulfate levels required for intracellular sulfation of proteoglycans [2]. For the health of intervertebral discs, active metabolites of vitamin D regulate proliferation, expression of matrix genes and production of certain proteins and cytokines in cells of annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus, the two macrostructural components of the discs [3,4].",

This degeneration can most likely be accounted for by mostly a genetic predisposition and partly by environmental factors. The environmental factors such as heavy physical activity can trigger a cascade of molecular events in disc degeneration, exacerbating the disorder in a vicious cycle. One of the factors playing a role in these molecular processes is the vitamin D system. Of note, VDRs (vitamin D receptors) are expressed in osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus cells of the discs [3,4]. In addition, vitamin D has been demonstrated to affect the proliferation and functional regulation of these cells and their production of certain proteins and cytokines in vitro. However, degenerative changes in bone and cartilage, either because of the natural aging or disease, can lead to fractures, spine instability and deformity, which can in turn result in chronic pain and neurological deficits. Also, a poor quality of bone affects the outcome of spine surgeries, especially instrumented ones, resulting in undesirable consequences.",

Also, the mechanisms such as the reduced capacity of intestinal absorption and the reduced skin synthesis of vitamin D are discussed in the context of aging [17]. However, clinical studies, particularly those for the spine, have shown that the age cannot be a good predictor of vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, studies conducted on patients with orthopedic surgery and spinal fusion have found a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in young adults [7,18]. Our study also revealed a significant direct correlation (p<0.001) between age and serum levels of 25(OH)D, which was independent of the effect resulting from the consumption of vitamin D supplement. The highest rate of vitamin D deficiency was seen for the 20-39-year-old age group. Considering this, care should be taken that although the aging population suffers from osteoporosis, osteomalacia, fractures and degenerative processes, young people should not be neglected. It may be that many of these pathological processes start early at youth and controlling vitamin D levels at a young age might prevent degenerative spine diseases later in life.",

In particular, in the case of the spine, both Stoker et al. [7] and Kim et al. [10] suggested an inverse correlation between the pain and the serum levels of vitamin D. Similar results have been reported for patients with chronic LBP and unsuccessful fusion surgery [15,28]. In spite of the abovementioned studies, we did not find any significant correlation between the severity of pain and the serum levels of vitamin D (p=0.467).",

However, several clinical studies [30] showed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in lower latitudes and in summer, among them in our country (Iran) where there is a good deal of sunlight and there is still a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. In the present study, similar to what were stated in the studies by Stoker et al. [7] and Kim et al. [10], there was not a significant difference between the serum levels of vitamin D and the different seasons (p=0.655).

Although the elderly and women are traditionally at a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency with consequences such as osteomalacia, osteoporosis, etc., there is also no safety margin for vitamin D deficiency among youths and men and they should not be ignored. On the other hand, given the diversity and differences in research results for vitamin D deficiency risk factors, they are not enough for predicting or proposing vitamin D deficiency and it is recommended that vitamin D deficiency prevention strategies comprise a broader spectrum of the population in order to prevent or delay the onset of degenerative diseases and their consequences. In addition, considering that vitamin D deficiency existed even for patients treated with supplements, attention should be paid to the correct and complete dosing after diagnosing the vitamin D deficiency.",
