            "text": "Stargardt disease (STGD1) due to mutations in the large ABCA4 gene is the most common inherited macular degeneration in humans. We have shown that dual adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors effectively transfer ABCA4 to the retina of Abca4\u2212/\u2212 mice. However, they express both lower levels of transgene compared with a single AAV and truncated proteins. To increase productive dual AAV concatemerization, which would overcome these limitations, we have explored the use of either various regions of homology or heterologous inverted terminal repeats (ITR). In addition, we tested the ability of various degradation signals to decrease the expression of truncated proteins. We found the highest levels of transgene expression using regions of homology based on either alkaline phosphatase or the F1 phage (AK). The use of heterologous ITR does not decrease the levels of truncated proteins relative to full-length ABCA4 and impairs AAV vector production. Conversely, the inclusion of the CL1 degradation signal results in the selective degradation of truncated proteins from the 5\u2032-half without affecting full-length protein production. Therefore, we developed dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors including homologous ITR2, the photoreceptor-specific G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 promoter, the AK region of homology and the CL1 degradation signal. We show that upon subretinal administration these vectors are both safe in pigs and effective in Abca4\u2212/\u2212 mice. Our data support the use of improved dual AAV vectors for gene therapy of STGD1.",

In the absence of a functional ABCA4 protein, vitamin A aldehyde forms bisretinoid adducts that are deposited in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells during the process of disc shedding and phagocytosis. Consequently, abnormally high levels of lipofuscin pigments, such as A2E and all-transretinal dimer-phosphatidylethanolamine, accumulate in the RPE, triggering RPE-cell death and causing secondary PR degeneration (2). Abca4\u2212/\u2212 mice (3), the only STGD1 animal model, recapitulate some of the features of the human retinal disease including abnormal lipofuscin accumulation in the RPE.",

            "text": "Sight-restoring therapy for many inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) including STGD1, is still a major unmet medical need. Gene therapy with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors represents, to date, the most promising approach for treatment of many IRDs (4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9). However, one of the main obstacles for the use of AAV is their packaging capacity limited to \u223c5 kb. This has become a limiting factor for the development of gene replacement therapy for common IRDs due to mutations in genes with a CDS larger than 5 kb, which include, among others, STGD1. Dual AAV vectors, based on the ability of AAV genomes to concatamerize via intermolecular recombination, have been successfully exploited to overcome this limitation (10)(11)(12). Others and we have recently shown the potential of dual AAV vectors in the retina (10,(13)(14)(15). In particular we have reported that dual AAV hybrid AK vectors which rely on both ITR-mediated concatemerization and homologous recombination mediated by the AK sequence of the F1 phage for the reconstitution of the full-length expression cassette, transduce efficiently mouse and pig PR and rescue the Abca4\u2212/\u2212 mouse retinal phenotype (10,15). However, critical issues need to be addressed before considering further clinical translation of this strategy. First, the levels of PR transduction achieved with dual AAV vectors are lower than those achieved with single normal size AAV vectors (10,15). A second major issue associated with the use of dual AAV vectors is the production of truncated proteins from the 5\u2032-half vector that contains the promoter sequence and/or from the 3\u2032-half vector due to the low promoter activity of the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) (10,13,16,17). Both increased transduction efficiency and reduction of truncated protein production may be achieved by boosting the directional formation of productive tail-to-head concatemers, which reduces the number of non-concatemerized single AAV vector halves from which the truncated protein products derive. Since directional reconstitution of dual AAV hybrid vectors relies on recombination mediated by regions of homology included in the two vectors, we sought to evaluate side-by-side the various recombinogenic regions used in the context of dual AAV hybrid vectors which include those derived from either the human placental alkaline phosphatase cDNA (12,18) or the AK sequence from the F1 phage (10).",

MicroRNA (miR) target sequences, artificial stop codons or protein ubiquitination signals can be exploited to mediate the degradation of truncated protein products. Among the miR expressed in the retina, miR-let7b or -26a are expressed at high levels (22)(23)(24)(25) while miR-124 and -204 have been shown to restrict AAV-mediated transgene expression to either RPE or PR, respectively (26). Signals that mediate the degradation of proteins include: (i) the short degron CL1, a C-terminal destabilizing peptide that shares structural similarities with misfolded proteins and is thus recognized by the ubiquitination system (27)(28)(29), (ii) ubiquitin, whose fusion at the Nterminal of a donor protein mediates both direct protein degradation or degradation via the N-end rule pathway (30,31) and (iii) the N-terminal PB29 degron which is a 9 aminoacid-long peptide which, similarly to the CL1 degron, is predicted to fold in structures that are recognized by enzymes of the ubiquitination pathway (32). Additionally, artificial stop codons can be inserted to cause the early termination of an mRNA. We evaluated the ability of these strategies to silence the expression of truncated proteins from dual AAV vectors.

            "text": "We evaluated in parallel the transduction efficacy of dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors with different regions of homology. The most used derive from either the head or tail (18) of the middle one-third of the human placental alkaline phosphatase cDNA (12). We have previously shown that dual AAV hybrid vectors including the AK sequence from the F1 phage outperform those including the sense placental alkaline phosphatase head region sequence [AP (10), Supplementary Material, Fig. S1], which we generated based on the description provided in Ghosh et al. (18). Recently, the exact sequence of the head and tail placental alkaline phosphatase sequences (AP1 and AP2) have been published by Lostal et al. (16). These correspond to the reverse complementary (antisense) sequences in the middle one-third of the AP cDNA (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). Thus, we compared the efficacy of these AP1 and AP2 sequences to that of both the AK sequence and of the AP sequence we have previously tested in Trapani et al. (10). For this purpose we generated dual AAV2/2 hybrid vectors that include the ABCA4-3\u00d7flag CDS, under the control of the ubiquitous CMV promoter, and either the AK (10), AP (10), AP1 or AP2 (16) regions of homology ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). We used these vectors to infect HEK293 cells [multiplicity of infection, m.o.i.: 5 \u00d7 10 4 genome copies (GC)/cell of each vector]. Cell lysates were analysed by Western blot with anti-3\u00d7flag antibodies to detect ABCA4-3\u00d7flag ( Fig. 2A). Each of the dual AAV hybrid vectors sets resulted in expression of full-length proteins of the expected size that were not detected in the lanes loaded with negative controls ( Fig. 2A). Quantification of ABCA4 expression ( Fig. 2B) showed that infection with dual AAV hybrid AP1 and AP2 vectors resulted in slightly higher levels of transgene expression than with dual AAV hybrid AK vectors and all significantly outperformed dual AAV hybrid AP vectors. We have previously found that the efficiency of dual AAV vectors which rely on homologous recombination is lower in terminally-differentiated cells as PR than in cell culture (10). We therefore evaluated PR-specific transduction levels in C57BL/6 mice following subretinal administration of dual AAV2/8 AK, AP1 and AP2 vectors which include the PR-specific human G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1) promoter (dose of each vector/eye: 1.9 \u00d7 10 9 GC; Fig. 2C). One month after vector administration we detected efficient ABCA4 protein expression more frequently in retinas treated with dual AAV hybrid AK than AP1 or AP2 vectors (Fig. 2C). However, the average ABCA4 expression levels from all treated eyes were not significantly different between eyes injected with dual AAV hybrid AK, AP1 and AP2 vectors [mean ABCA4 levels: AK: 3.7 \u00b1 0.9 arbitrary units (a.u.); AP1: 3.7 \u00b1 0.9 a.u.; AP2: 2.5 \u00b1 0.5 a.u. No significant differences were found using one-way ANOVA. More details on the quantification and specific statistical values can be found in the Material and Methods section]. .

The upper arrow indicates full-length proteins, the lower arrow indicates truncated proteins from the 3\u2032-half vector.

            "text": "To test if the use of heterologous ITR improves the productive directional concatemerization of dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors, we generated dual AAV2/2 hybrid ABCA4 vectors that included the ABCA4-3\u00d7flag CDS with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 in either the 5:2 (left ITR from AAV5 and right ITR from AAV2) or the 2:5 (left ITR from AAV2 and right ITR from AAV5) configuration. The production of dual AAV vectors bearing heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 requires the simultaneous expression of the Rep proteins from AAV serotypes 2 and 5 which cannot cross-complement virus replication (19). Indeed, it has been shown that Rep2 and Rep5 can bind interchangeably to ITR2 or ITR5, although less efficiently than to homologous ITR, however they cannot cleave the terminal resolution sites of the ITR from the other serotype (33). Therefore, before generating dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5, we assessed the potential competition of (i) Rep5 with Rep2 in the production of AAV2/2-CMV-EGFP vectors (i.e. vectors with homologous ITR2) and (ii) Rep2 with Rep5 in the production of AAV5/2-CMV-EGFP vectors (i.e. vectors with homologous ITR5), using the same amount of the Rep5Cap2 and Rep2Cap2 packaging constructs (ratio1:1). Indeed, when the Rep5Cap2 packaging construct is provided in addition to Rep2Cap2, the total yields of AAV2/2-CMV-EGFP vectors are reduced to 42% of those of control preparations obtained when only Rep2Cap2 is provided as packaging construct (average of four independent preps of each type, p Student's t-test: 0.014). Conversely, no significant differences were found in the total yields of AAV5/2-CMV-EGFP preps obtained when Rep2Cap2 was added to Rep5Cap2, which were 83% of those obtained when Rep5Cap2 was the only packaging construct transfected (average of four independent preps of each type, no significant differences were found using Student's t-test). Given the competition of Rep5 with Rep2 in the production of vectors with ITR2, we tested three different ratios between Rep5 and the Rep2Cap2 packaging constructs in the production of dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 (Protocol A with 1:1, Protocol B with 1:3 and Protocol C with 1:10 Rep5:Rep2Cap2 ratio). As shown in Supplementary Material, Table S1, viral titres determined by PCR quantification using a probe annealing to ITR2 progressively increased when the amount of Rep5 was decreased, with the best titre obtained with Protocol C. These results confirmed the competition of Rep5 with Rep2 during the production of vectors with ITR2 and led us to follow Protocol C for the production of AAV vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5. However, several AAV preparations obtained with this strategy revealed: (i) up to 6-fold lower titres determined on ITR2 than titres determined on a transgenic sequence in between the ITR (Table 1) which could suggest that the integrity of ITR2 is compromised and (ii) a mean reduction of about 6-fold in the total yields of AAV vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 compared with those containing homologous ITR2 ( p Student's t-test: 0.04;  The sequences underlined correspond to the degradation signals while those not underlined have been included for cloning purposes. Table 1). However, Southern blot analysis of AAV preparations with heterologous ITR revealed no evident alterations of genome integrity (Fig. 3A). To test if the inclusion of heterologous ITR in dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors enhanced the formation of tailto-head productive concatemers and full-length protein transduction while reducing the production of truncated proteins, we infected HEK293 cells with dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors with either heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 (in the 5:2/2:5 configuration) or homologous ITR2 (Fig. 3B). Given the difference between the ITR2 and transgene titres for vectors with heterologous but not homologous ITR (Table 1), we infected cells with 10 4 GC/cell of each vector based on either ITR2 or transgene titres. Western blot analysis of HEK293 cells infected with dual AAV vectors based on ITR2 titres showed that the inclusion of heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 resulted in higher levels of both full-length and truncated protein than the inclusion of homologous ITR2 ( Fig. 3B and C). However this was not observed when HEK293 cells were infected with the same dual AAV vector preps based on the transgene titre ( Fig. 3B and D). In conclusion, the ratio between full-length and truncated protein expression was similar regardless of the ITR included in the vectors and of the vector titre used to dose cells ( Fig. 3C and D).",

            "text": "To selectively reduce the levels of truncated ABCA4 proteins produced by each 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-half of dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors (10), we placed putative degradation sequences in the 5\u2032-half vector after the splicing donor signal between AK and the right ITR, and in the 3\u2032-half vector between AK and the splicing acceptor signal (Fig. 1). Thus, the degradation signal will be included in the truncated but not in the full-length protein which results from a spliced mRNA. As degradation signals in the 5\u2032-half vectors we have included: (i) the CL1 degron (CL1), (ii) four copies of the miR-let7b target site (4\u00d7let7b), (iii) four copies of the miR-26a target site (4\u00d726a) or (iv) the combination of three copies each of miR-204 and miR-124 target sites (3\u00d7204 + 3\u00d7124) ( Table 2). As degradation signals in the 3\u2032-half vectors we have included: (i) three stop codons (STOP), (ii) PB29 either in a single (PB29) or in three tandem copies (3\u00d7PB29) or (iii) ubiquitin ( we used a plasmid encoding for the reporter EGFP protein and containing the miR target sites before the polyadenylation signal (data not shown). The same experimental settings were used for further evaluation of the miR target sites in the context of dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors. We found that inclusion of miR-204 + 124 and 26a target sequences in the 5\u2032-half of dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors reduced albeit did not abolish the expression of the truncated protein products ( Fig. 4A and Supplementary Material, Table S2). Notably, as shown in Figure 4B, we found that the inclusion of the CL1 degradation signal in the 5\u2032-half vector reduced truncated protein expression to undetectable levels. Since differences in the tissue-specific expression of enzymes of the ubiquitination pathway that mediate CL1 degradation (27) may account for changes in CL1 efficacy, we further evaluated the efficacy of the CL1 degron in the pig retina, which has a size and structure similar to human (15,26,36,37) and is therefore an excellent pre-clinical large animal model to evaluate vector safety and efficiency. To this aim, we injected subretinally in Large White pigs AAV2/ 8 dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors (of which the 5\u2032-half vector included or not the CL1 sequence, dose of each vector/eye: 1 \u00d7 10 11 GC). Notably, we found that the inclusion of the CL1 degradation signal in the 5\u2032-half vector resulted in reduction of truncated protein expression to levels that are below the detection limit of the Western blot analysis (Fig. 4C). Among the degradation signals tested in the 3\u2032-half vector we identified three (PB29, 3\u00d7PB29 and ubiquitin) that reduced both the levels of truncated protein products and of full-length proteins (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2 and Table S3).",

            "text": "Subretinal administration of improved dual AAV vectors reduces lipofuscin accumulation in the Abca4\u2212/\u2212 retina Based on our findings, improved dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors should include homologous ITR2, the AK region of homology and CL1. As ABCA4 is expressed in both rod and cone photoreceptors in humans (38), we identified a suitable promoter for ABCA4 delivery by comparing the PR transduction properties of single AAV2/8 vectors encoding EGFP from either the human GRK1 or IRBP (interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein) promoters, which have been both described to drive high levels of combined rod and cone PR transduction in various species (39)(40)(41). Taking advantage of the pig retinal architecture which includes a streak-like region with a cone:rod = 1:3 (42) similar to the human macula, we injected subretinally 1 \u00d7 10 11 GC/eye of either AAV2/8-GRK1-or IRBP-EGFP vectors in 3 month-old Large White pigs. Four weeks after the injection, we analysed the corresponding retinal cryosections under a fluorescence microscope. EGFP fluorescence quantification in the PR cell layer (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3a and b) showed that both promoters give comparable levels of PR transduction ( predominantly rods in this region). However, when we counted the number of cones labelled with an antibody raised against cone arrestin (CAR) (43) that were also EGFP-positive, we found higher although not statistically significant levels of cone PR transduction with the GRK1 promoter ( Supplementary Material, Fig. S3C and D). Based on this, we included the GRK1 promoter in our improved dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors, and investigated their ability to both express ABCA4 and decrease the abnormal content of autofluorescent lipofuscin material in the RPE of Abca4\u2212/\u2212 mice. We initially injected subretinally 1 month-old C57/BL6 mice with improved dual AAV vectors (dose of each vector/eye: 2 \u00d7 10 9 GC) and found that 12 out of 24 (50%) injected eyes had detectable albeit variable levels of full-length ABCA4 protein by Western blot [Figure 5A; ABCA4 protein levels in the ABCA4-positive eyes: 2.8 \u00b1 0.7 a.u. (mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean)]. This is similar to our previous finding that a different version of the dual AAV platform resulted in 50% ABCA4-expressing eyes (10). We then injected 5.5 month-old pigmented Abca4\u2212/\u2212 mice subretinally in the temporal region of the eye with the improved dual AAV vectors (dose of each vector/eye: 1.8 \u00d7 10 9 GC). Three months later we harvested the eyes and measured the levels of lipofuscin fluorescence (excitation: 560 \u00b1 40 nm; emission: 645 \u00b1 75) on retinal cryosections [in either the RPE alone or in RPE + outer segments (OS)] in the temporal region of the eye (Fig. 5B and C and Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). We found that lipofuscin fluorescence intensity in this region of the eye was significantly higher in untreated Abca4\u2212/\u2212 than in both Abca4+/\u2212 and \u2212/\u2212 mice injected with the therapeutic dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors (Fig. 5B and C and Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). Then, using transmission electron microscopy we counted the number of RPE lipofuscin granules. These were increased in 5.5-to 6-month old albino Abca4\u2212/\u2212 mice injected with PBS compared with agematched Abca4+/+ controls (Fig. 5D), at levels similar to those we have independently measured in Abca4\u2212/\u2212 mice either uninjected or injected with a control AAV vector (data not shown). The number of lipofuscin granules in Abca4\u2212/\u2212 RPE was normalized 3 months post subretinal injection of improved dual AAV hybrid ABCA4 vectors (dose of each vector/eye: 1 \u00d7 10 9 GC, Fig. 5D).",

            "text": "AAV restricted packaging capacity represents one of the main obstacles to the widespread application of AAV for gene therapy of IRDs including STGD1. However, recently, several groups, including ours, have independently reported effective delivery of large genes to both the mouse and pig retina by dual AAV vectors (10,13,15,44), thus expanding their applicability to diseases like STGD1 due to mutations in genes with a CDS which exceeds the canonical AAV cargo capacity. Here we set-up to overcome some limitations associated with the use of dual AAV vectors, namely their relatively low efficiency when compared with a single vector, and the production of truncated proteins which may raise safety concerns. Strategies aiming at increasing dual AAV genome tail-to-head concatemerization should in theory increase the levels of full-length and reduce those of truncated proteins from free single half-vectors. We set to improve tail-to-head dual AAV hybrid genome concatemerization by including either optimal regions of homology or heterologous ITR. In a side-byside evaluation of previously described regions of homology, we have found that the AP1 and AP2 sequences recently published by Lostal et al. (16) and the AK sequence from the F1 phage (10) drive overall similar levels of protein expression in vitro, with dual AAV hybrid AK vectors driving efficient ABCA4 expression in the mouse retina more frequently than those with AP1 and AP2 sequences. Independently, the availability of different regions of homology will still be useful to direct proper concatemerization of triple AAV vectors which are being exploited to further expand AAV cargo capacity (16,45). Heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 have been successfully included in dual (20,21) and triple (45) AAV vectors. We found that, although the genome of AAV vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 is homogeneous in size, the yields of AAV vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 are lower than those of vectors with homologous ITR2. We also detected less vector genomes with heterologous ITR when we probe their ITR2 than when we probe a different region of their genome. As we show that Rep5 interferes with production of vectors with ITR2, this suggests anomalies at the level of ITR2 included in AAV vectors with heterologous ITR, which are produced in the presence of Rep5, but not in AAV vectors with homologous ITR2, which are produced only in the presence of Rep2 and that showed similar titres whether we probed ITR2 or a different region of the genome. In addition, regardless of the titre used to perform the infections, inclusion of heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 in dual AAV hybrid vectors did not result in significant increase in the rates of full-length to truncated protein production. These results partly differ from those previously reported where dual AAV vectors with heterologous ITR2 and ITR5 had higher transduction efficiency than vectors with homologous ITRs and apparently no production issues (20,21). Besides the different packaging constructs and production protocols, in this study we used dual AAV hybrid vectors which included regions of homology between the two half-vectors as opposed to the trans-splicing (TS) system used in the previous reports which simply relies on the ITR for concatemerization (20,21). As in dual AAV hybrid vectors the reconstitution of the full-length gene is mainly mediated by the region of homology included in the vectors (12) which directs concatemer formation, this may account for the lack in the increase in transgene expression we observed with vectors with heterologous ITR compared with the previous studies that used TS vectors (20,21).",

The inclusion of miR target sites in the transcript of a gene has been shown to be an effective strategy to knock-down and restrict transgene expression in various tissues, including the retina (26). However, we achieved only a partial reduction of truncated protein production with miR target sites. Although we cannot rule out that miR target sites lead to a more effective silencing in the mouse retina than in vitro, our in vitro experiments suggest that features of the mRNA external to the miR target sites rather than miRNA levels might affect the efficiency of the silencing. Indeed, while miR mimics provide robust silencing of a canonical EGFP expression cassette containing the miR target sites, this silencing was less robust when we tested the same mimics with dual AAV ABCA4 vectors (Fig. 4A). Along this line, since the truncated protein products that derive from the 5\u2032-half are produced from a vector that is not endowed with a canonical polyadenilation signal, it may be possible that the resulting mRNA cannot undergo an efficient miR-mediated silencing (46,47).",

We showed that this signal is effective both in vitro and in the pig retina, indicating that the enzymes of the degradative pathway required for CL1 activity are expressed in various cell types. On the other hand, we found that none of the degradation signals tested in the 3\u2032-half vectors significantly reduced truncated protein expression without affecting full-length protein expression. In addition, we found a negative correlation between the length of the degradation signal included in the 3\u2032-half vector and the levels of protein expression, possibly indicating that increasing the size of the sequences between the ITR and the splicing acceptor signal interferes with mRNA processing. However, we could never abolish truncated protein formation from the 3\u2032-half vectors even using different lengths of degradation sequences. Since 3\u2032-half vectors do not have a canonical promoter with a defined transcription start site, it is possible that start codons downstream of the region of the vector where we included the degradation signals are recognized more efficiently than the ATG of the degradation signals. This would result in exclusion of the degradation signal from the truncated proteins. As the truncated protein product from the 3\u2032-half vector is less abundant than that produced by the 5\u2032-half vector ( Fig. 4A and Supplementary Material, Fig. S2), its presence should raise less safety concerns. Indeed, although further formal toxicity studies are required to finally address this issue, data presented here in the mouse and pig retina support the safety of improved dual AAV vectors.",

This could be due to both the inherent variability of the subretinal injection in the small murine eye and the overall lower efficacy of the dual AAV system compared with a single AAV vector (10). Despite this variability, we found that dual AAV mediated ABCA4 delivery results in significant lipofuscin reduction in the Abca4\u2212/\u2212 retina suggesting that a wide range of transgene expression levels can similarly contribute to therapeutic efficacy. This was observed using two independent techniques, however, more pronounced improvement of the phenotype was observed when we dissected and analysed the AAV transduced area of the retina that indeed showed normalization of the number of lipofuscin granules. HPLC measurement of A2E, the major lipofuscin granules component, has been used to assess the efficacy of therapies in Abca4\u2212/\u2212 mice (48)(49)(50). However, we found these measurements to be inconsistent in our hands, even between affected and normal retinas (data not shown), thus we were not able to use this technique in our rescue experiments.",

The DNA was extracted twice with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with two volumes of ethanol 100 and 10% sodium acetate (3 M, pH 7). Alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis and blotting were performed as previously described (60). Ten microlitres of the 1 kb DNA ladder (N3232L; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were loaded as molecular weight marker. Two different double strand DNA fragments were labelled with digoxigenin-dUTP using the DIG high prime DNA labelling and detection starter kit (Roche), and used as probes. The 5\u2032 probe (768 bp) was generated by double digestion of the pZac2.1-CMV-ABCA4_5\u2032 plasmid with SpeI and NotI; the 3\u2032 probe (974 bp) was generated by double digestion of the pZac2.1-ABCA4_3\u2032_3\u00d7flag_SV40 plasmid with ClaI and MfeI. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 65\u00b0C in Church buffer (60) for 1 h and overnight, respectively.

Before harvesting the eyeballs, the temporal aspect of the sclerae was marked by cauterization, in order to orient the eyes with respect to the injection site at the moment of the inclusion. The eyeballs were cut so that the lens and vitreous could be removed while leaving the eyecup intact. Mice eyecups were infiltrated with 30% sucrose for cryopreservation and embedded in tissue-freezing medium (O.C.T. matrix; Kaltek, Padua, Italy). For each eye, 150-200 serial sections (10 \u00b5m thick) were cut along the horizontal plane and the sections were progressively distributed on 10 slides so that each slide contained 15-20 sections, each representative of the entire eye at different levels. The sections were stained with 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vectashield; Vector Lab, Peterborough, UK) and were monitored with a Zeiss Axiocam (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at different magnifications. Pigs were sacrificed, and their eyeballs were harvested and fixed overnight by immersion in 4% PFA. The eyeballs were cut so that the lens and vitreous could be removed, leaving the eyecups in place. The eyecups were gradually dehydrated by progressively infiltrating them with 10, 20 and 30% sucrose. Tissuefreezing medium (O.C.T. matrix; Kaltek) embedding was performed. Before embedding, the swine eyecups were analyzed with a fluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) in order to localize the transduced region whenever an EGFP-encoding vector was administered. For each eye, 200-300 serial sections (12 \u00b5m thick) were cut along the horizontal meridian and the sections were progressively distributed on glass slides so that each slide contained 6-10 sections.

Briefly, for each eye six different z-stacks from six different transduced regions were taken. For each z-stack, images from single plans were used to count CAR+/EGFP + cells. In doing this, we carefully moved along the Z-axis to distinguish one cell from another and thus to avoid to count twice the same cell. For each retina we counted the CAR-positive (CAR+)/EGFP-positive (EGFP+) cells on total CAR + cells. We then calculated the average number of CAR+/EGFP + cells of the three eyes of each experimental group.",

Eyes were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde-2% PFA in 0.1 M PHEM buffer pH 6.9 (240 m\uf76d PIPES, 100 m\uf76d HEPES, 8 m\uf76d MgCl2, 40 m\uf76d EGTA) overnight and then rinsed in 0.1 M PHEM buffer. Eyes were then dissected under light microscope to select the tyrosinase-positive portions of the eyecups. The transduced portion of the eyecups were subsequently embedded in 12% gelatin, infused with 2.3 M sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (50 nm) were cut using a Leica Ultramicrotome EM FC7 (Leica Microsystems) and extreme care was taken to align PR connecting cilia longitudinally. To avoid bias in the attribution of morphological data to the various experimental groups, counts of lipofuscin granules were performed by a masked operator (Dr Roman Polishchuk) using the iTEM software (Olympus SYS, Hamburg, Germany). The 'Touch count' module of the iTEM software was used to count the number of lipofuscin granules in 25 \u00b5m 2 areas (at least 40) distributed randomly across the RPE layer. The granule density was expressed as number of granules per 25 \u00b5m 2 .",

We generated dual AAV2/2 hybrid ABCA4 vectors including the various degradation signals and evaluated their efficacy after infection of HEK293 cells [m.o.i.: 5 \u00d7 10 4 GC/cell of each vector]. Since miR-let7b, miR-26a, miR-204 and miR-124 are poorly expressed or completely absent in HEK293 cells [Ambion miRNA Research Guide and (34)], to test silencing of the constructs which contain their corresponding target sites, we transfected cells with miR mimics [i.e. small, chemically modified double-stranded RNAs that mimic endogenous miR(35)], prior to infection with the AAV2/2 vectors containing the corresponding target sites. To define the concentration of miR mimics required to achieve silencing of a gene containing the corresponding miR target sites,",
