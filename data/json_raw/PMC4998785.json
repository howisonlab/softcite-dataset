            "text": "Due to the neurotoxicity effects of general anesthesia (GA) and sedatives found in animal studies, there is a general recommendation to avoid nonurgent surgical procedures requiring anesthesia in children younger than 3 years of age. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of anesthesia-related postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) on the first day (Day 1) and at 6 weeks after elective noncardiac surgery in school-age children. This was a prospective cohort study of 118 children undergoing GA and 126 age-matched controls of school children aged 5 to 12 years. All children were given a panel of 4 neuropsychological assessments (Hong Kong List Learning for verbal memory, Visual Matching for processing speed, Visual Memory, and General Comprehension Skill from the Hong Kong Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children). The primary outcome was the incidence of POCD on Day 1 and at 6 weeks after surgery. POCD was defined as when at least 2 of the 4 cognitive function tests showed individual Z-scores \u00c01.96 or a combined Z-score \u00c01.96. Using the combined Z-score definition, the incidence of POCD in the GA group on Day 1 and at 6 weeks were 5.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1-10.3) and 3.4% (95% CI: 1.1-8.0), respectively. No POCD was found using the other definition. The incidences of decline and improvement in neuropsychological tests were similar between groups over time except for a higher risk in visual matching impairment in the anesthesia group (11.9%) versus control group (1.6%) on Day 1 (P < 0.01). The adjusted relative risk ratio of postoperative cognitive decline to improvement between groups on Day 1 and at 6 weeks were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.10-7.05) and 0.45 (95% CI: 0.04-4.84), respectively. The observed risk of POCD is assumed to apply to current drugs and techniques used in GA. In conclusion, the incidence of POCD was low. GA was associated with a transient effect on visual matching. When using the widely accepted Z-score definitions and relative risk ratio methodology, we found no anesthesia-related POCD per se in school-age children.",

            "text": "M any children require anesthesia for surgical procedures and investigations each year, with approximately 450,000 children undergoing in-patient surgery each year in the United States. 1 A common parental concern is whether general anesthesia (GA) has potentially deleterious effects on children's cognitive and academic development. A consensus statement by the US Food and Drug Administration, SmartTots, and the American Academy of Pediatrics 2 recommends avoiding nonurgent surgical procedures requiring anesthesia in children younger than 3 years of age because of the neurotoxicity and neuroplasticity effects of GA and sedatives shown in animal studies. 3 Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) has been defined as a subtle impairment of memory, concentration, and speed of information processing after surgery. 4 While the epidemiology of POCD in adults after cardiac 5 and noncardiac surgery 6,7 has been well established, most existing pediatric studies have focused on the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes after GA exposure before the age of 4 years. 8,9 Current evidence suggests that early exposure to anesthesia is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental deficits (odds ratio 1.9, 95% credible interval 1.2-3.0). 8 However, the risk of language and abstract reasoning deficits at age 10 after an initial exposure to anesthesia in children over 3 years old was similar to other children with no exposure to anesthesia. 10 There is a paucity of studies on the short-term effects of anesthesia on cognitive function performance in school-age children. A randomized controlled trial of propofol versus isoflurane in 58 children aged between 5 and 14 years showed that both groups had visual memory deficits at 24 h after dental surgery. 11 Compared with sevoflurane, children given propofol had visual memory deficits at 1 week, but recovered at 3 months, after elective hernia surgery. 12 In contrast, there was no effect of halothane-nitrous oxide GA on reasoning, motor or memory functions at 24 h after myringotomy in children aged between 5 and 8 years when compared with a control group (no anesthesia). 13 These findings highlight the heterogeneity in study designs, type of neuropsychological tests, POCD definition, and timing of POCD used.",

Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the test-retest reliability of the cognitive function tests between baseline and follow-up sessions. 20 We modeled individual serial changes in cognitive function tests using mixedeffects linear regressions by assuming different random intercepts for each participant and adjusted for baseline intelligence quotient (IQ), age, gender, and any previous exposure to anesthesia. List-wise deletion was used to deal with missing completely at random follow-up data; it has been recommended that tests with missing data should not be used for evaluation of cognitive function. 21 The primary outcome was incidence of POCD. This was estimated from the Z-scores methodology that requires data from the control group outlined by Rasmussen et al. 21 We used 2 criteria to define the direction of change (either decline or improvement) in the postoperative cognitive function in each child. POCD was defined as either at least 2 of the 4 cognitive functions tests with an individual Z-score \u00c01.96 or a combined Z-score of \u00c01.96. Similarly, postoperative cognitive improvement (POCI) was defined as either at least 2 of the 4 cognitive functions tests with an individual Z-score !1.96 or a combined Z-score of !1.96. To identify whether the postoperative cognitive decline in performance in these children represented a true deterioration or random variation, we used multinominal logistic regression to estimate the relative risk ratio of POCD to POCI between groups (POCD/POCI-RRR) 20 after adjusting for IQ, age, and gender. All analyses were performed using STATA 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). The level of significance was set at P < 0.05.",

It should be noted that there were similar low incidences (<10%) of cognitive impairment and improvement for all tests in both groups at each time point except visual matching in the anesthesia group on Day 1. When using the criterion of at least 2 tests with 2 SD decline, there was no association between GA and POCD. However, the results were imprecise when the combined Z-score criterion was adopted, with the POCD Our study provides weak evidence for the association between GA and visual matching, a measure of processing speed, on Day 1. For every 10 children undergoing GA, a decline in visual matching will occur in 1 in the early postoperative period. This is likely related to general discomfort from surgery, postoperative analgesic effects and the residual effects of longer GA. A post hoc analysis showed that children with a decline in visual matching scores had longer GA (median 159 min, IQR 130-288) than those with no decline (median 116 min, IQR 71-187) (P \u00bc 0.03). All children with visual matching impairment recovered before the 6-week follow-up assessment. In other studies, reaction time returned to baseline levels at 24 to 48 h after midazolam premedication, propofol, isoflurane, or sevoflurane-nitrous oxide anesthesia for dental procedures. 11,22,23 Compared with sevoflurane, propofol was associated with visual memory impairment at 1 week, but not at 3 months, after elective hernia surgery but the study did not control for a practice learning effect. 12 Taking all these results together, it appears that GA is associated with transient subtle effects on cognitive function in school-age children.",

While the use of a control group helped adjust for improved performance from learning and extraneous variables, 7 we found significant baseline differences between groups in half the panel of neuropsychological tests undertaken. This suggests that some selection bias was present despite comparable baseline characteristics described in Table 1. As children undergoing surgery were more likely to be anxious in an unfamiliar hospital environment than at school, this may have affected their baseline tests performance. Nevertheless, our results are generally consistent with a previous study showing no effect of halothane-nitrous oxide GA on reasoning, motor or memory functions at 24 h after myringotomy in children aged between 5 and 8 years old. 13 There are several limitations in this study. Our study included children with relatively high IQs; the mean IQ in another Hong Kong study of similar age children was estimated to be 115. 17 The results have some generalizability to current pediatric anesthesia practice even if our data are old and the type of GA was not always standardized between anesthesiologists. Apart from intravenous thiopentone induction, our GA used current anesthetic agents namely midazolam premedication, propofol or sevoflurane induction, maintenance with nitrous oxide, oxygen, sevoflurane or isoflurane, neuromuscular blockade, and mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless, we believe that the publication of this data may give further assurance to parents on the safety of GA in this patient age group.",
