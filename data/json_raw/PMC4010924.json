            "text": "The ability to perturb individual genes in genome-wide experiments has been instrumental in unraveling cellular and disease properties. Here we introduce, describe the assembly, and demonstrate the use of comprehensive and versatile transcription activator-like effector (TALE) libraries. As a proof of principle, we built an 11-mer library that covers all possible combinations of the nucleotides that determine the TALE-DNA binding specificity. We demonstrate the versatility of the methodology by constructing a constraint library, customized to bind to a known p53 motif. To verify the functionality in assays, we applied the 11-mer library in yeast-one-hybrid screens to discover TALEs that activate human SCN9A and miR-34b respectively. Additionally, we performed a genome-wide screen using the complete 11-mer library to confirm known genes that confer cycloheximide resistance in yeast. Considering the highly modular nature of TALEs and the versatility and ease of constructing these libraries we envision broad implications for high-throughput genomic assays.",

TALE family members contain a highly conserved and repetitive region ( Fig. 1a) and their DNA binding capacities are dependent on the amino acid positions 12 and 13 (i.e. repeat variable diresidue or RVD) of each modular repeat 3,4 . Recent advances show that TALE proteins consist of a modular DNA-binding domain (DBD) that can be rapidly synthesized de novo 5 . The ability to complement the DBD with a functional domain permits a wide range of applications that include gene activation, repression, and nucleotide deletion and insertion, in a variety of model organisms and cell types [6][7][8][9][10] .",

Unfortunately, currently available methods are highly constrained, expensive, and often suffer from non-specific target effects [11][12][13][14][15] . Traditionally, these assays involve mutations or RNAi and explore the effect of loss of function coupled with selective pressure [15][16][17] . The complement, or gain-of-function, can be partially accomplished in yeast with introduction of cDNA 18 . In mammalian cells, a recently developed methodology provides a path for the use of zinc finger 19 proteins for genetic screens 20,21 . This protein-based technology can expand the repertoire of genetic screening in human cells by allowing the delivery of a variety of functional domains. In addition, RNAi-based screening is extensively used for genome-wide screens 11,22 , and typically relies on shRNA delivery. Finally, the CRISPR-Cas9 system was recently used to perform genetic screens in human cells using genome-scale lentiviral single-guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries 23,24 .",

The enabling modification is the use of a predetermined mixture of the four building modules during the first step of the assembly (Fig. 1c). The flanking sequences of the four modules are identical. Therefore, during the enzyme-based digestion and ligase-based ligation reactions these modules have an equal probability in appearing in the final TALE construct (Methods and Supplementary Material). To test the library fidelity we subjected our 11-mer TALE mixture to standard Sanger sequencing using primers flanking the TALE DNA binding domain (Supplementary Table 1, P23 and P24). The sequencing results show that there are 6-nucleotide long repeats, spaced by 102 nucleotides, which have variable signature (Supplementary Fig. 1a). This general profile perfectly matches the TALE tandem repeat structure which contains 102 nucleotides and has RVDs which are 6-nucleotides in length. Importantly the composition of different peaks within these 6-nucleotide noisy elements closely tracks the expected composition. In particular, when equal amounts of all four possible RVDs are used for all positions, the first nucleotide position should consist of 75% A and 25% C ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) and indeed the results have the expected sequencing profile ( Supplementary Fig. 1c). Similarly, at position 2 of the RVD sequence, we should have only nucleotide A which was confirmed by sequencing ( Supplementary Fig. 1c). The sequencing results confirm all positions.",

Importantly, we observed that TALE-VP16 can be designed to bind to the minus strand of a target sequence and in addition, can also be designed to target sequences within the ORF. We emphasize that one fundamental difference between our approach and all previous applications of TALEs is that our screening procedure does not rely on TALE-DNA binding prediction algorithms 28,30 . This is a considerable advantage as available algorithms may not yet fully capture the dynamics of TALE-DNA interactions. Indeed, we designed four 11-mer TALE-VP16 constructs for the same SCN9A bait sequence using the TALE-NT 2.0 program (Supplementary Table 3) and observed that all fusions, as well as combinations, failed to induce the overexpression of SCN9A mRNA levels in HEK293 (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Figs. 7 and 9). Additional insight can be gathered from recovered RVDs ( Supplementary Table 3), as none of the iso-lated positive TALE-VP16 clones contain RVD sequences exactly matching the canonical TALE-DNA binding code. As an example, for the target sequence 59-GTTGCCTCCCC-39, instead of the predicted canonical RVD sequence the four isolated clones contained at least one RVD difference. Therefore, the TALE-DNA binding information extracted from our library can be used in the future to refine the TALE-DNA binding algorithms.",

The underlying mechanisms of cycloheximide resistance are well-studied. For example, in yeast S. cerevisiae, overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as Pdr5p has been shown to contribute to cycloheximide resistance 31 . In addition, the expression of the PDR5 gene is known to be positively regulated by two homologous zinc fingercontaining transcription regulators, Pdr1p and Pdr3p 32 . We first determined the lowest concentration cycloheximide (0.5 mg/ml) at which the wild-type yeast cells failed to grow (Supplementary Material). We applied the complete TALE-VP16 library and isolated eighteen positive clones which tolerate cycloheximide (e.g., selected clones illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 10). Subsequently, we isolated the TALE-VP16 fusion plasmids and re-transformed them back to the wild-type cells for confirmation, as in the original screen natural mutations of the yeast genome (both gain-of-function 33 and loss-of-function 34 ) can artificially increase the resistance to cycloheximide. Five genuine positive clones were confirmed (Fig. 3a), isolated and sequenced to extract the TALE RVD sequences (Supplementary Table 3).",

First, we cloned four copies of the predicted PDR3 and PDR5 promoter targets and their immediate adjacent sequences in front of a fluorescence reporter gene (mKate2) in yeast.

All rescued pGADT7-TALE-VP16 plasmids were subjected to standard Sanger sequencing using the forward primer P23 and the reverse primer P24 ( Supplementary Table 1), which are flanking sequences of the DNA binding domain of TALE proteins. After extracting the RVD sequences, the TALE potential target sequences were determined by the Target Finder function of TALE-NT 2.0 28 using the setting ''upstream base T''. Since TALE-NT 2.0 only supports sequences which are between 12 and 31 RVDs, for each TALE we conducted four searches by adding one additional RVD (HD or NN or NI or NG) to the end of our RVD sequences. The lowest score from one of these four searches was defined as ''the lowest possible score''. The targets were considered as potentially genuine only when the lowest possible score is less than 9, as lower scores indicate higher confidence of the bindings between TALE fusions and their predicted DNA target sequences.",

Subsequently, the cellular debris was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 3 g for 10 min. The supernatant (primary recombinant AAV virus stock) was transferred into a fresh tube and stored at 280uC. The QuickTiter AAV Quantitation Kit (Cell Biolabs, #VPK-145-T) was used to determine the titers (genome copy/mL, GC/mL) of the recombinant AAV viral stocks. In brief, any free nucleic acids were first removed and the intact AAV viruses were captured using the QuickTiter AAV Capture Matrix. The captured viruses were then denatured to release the viral nucleic acids, which were subsequently labeled with fluorescence tags.
