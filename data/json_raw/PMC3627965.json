            "text": "Hypotrachyna (Vainio) Hale is a somewhat rare lichen genus found on the Korean Peninsula. Since it was first recorded more than two decades ago, no detailed taxonomic or revisionary study of the genus has been conducted. Thus, the present study was conducted to carry out a detailed taxonomic and revisionary study of Hypotrachyna in South Korea. This study was based on specimens deposited in the Korean Lichen Research Institute (KoLRI). Detailed taxonomic studies and a literature review confirmed the presence of seven species of Hypotrachyna from South Korea, including one new record, Hypotrachyna nodakensis (Asahina) Hale. Descriptions of each species with their morphological, anatomical and chemical characters together with a key to all known Hypotrachyna species are presented."

            "text": "The genus Hypotrachyna (Vainio) Hale was segregated from the collective genus Parmelia Ach. s. lat. by Hale [1]. According to Hale [2], the segregated Hypotrachyna was a unique group in the Parmeliaceae due to the presence of a characteristic branching pattern of the rhizines. Recent phylogenetic studies of foliose Parmeliaceae conducted by Blanco et al. [3] and Crespo et al. [4] have revealed seven and eight well-supported clades, respectively. In both studies, Hypotrachyna clade is distinguished as one of the main clade. Several genera (Cetrariastrum, Everniastrum, Hypotrachyna, and Parmelinopsis) are included in the Hypotrachyna clade [4], with Hypotrachyna being the largest and containing more than 190 species [5,6].",

Additionally, a compound microscope (Zeiss Scope. A1; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) was used to investigate the anatomy of thalli and fruiting bodies. Spot test reactions were conducted to investigate the thalli under a compound microscope, and thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed in solvent systems A (toluene:dioxin:acetic acid = 180:45:5) and C (toluene:acetic acid = 85:15) [13]. All examined locations of specimens were mapped using the open source GIS software Quantum GIS 1.7.0 (QGIS). Voucher specimens have been deposited in the herbarium of the Lichen and Allied Bio-resource Center at the KoLRI, Sunchon National University, South Korea. In the identification key, the newly reported species are indicated in bold.",

            "text": "Remarks: H. nodakensis is new to South Korea and a somewhat rare species. It is characterized by the presence of simple to corraloid branched isidia and protolichesterinic and gyrophoric acids in the medulla. According to Chen et al. [14], H. nodakensis closely resembles H. infirma and H. ikomae due to the presence of isidia and fatty acids in the medulla. However, it differs from H. infirma by not having caperatic and norcaperatic acids in the medulla. H. ikomae has the same fatty acids in the medulla as H. nodakensis, but lacks gyrophoric acid.  (Fig. 3). Geographical distribution: This species has been reported from China [15] and Japan [16].  Thallus foliose, adnate to loosely adnate, 3~8 cm across. Lobes crowded, sublinear, 1~3 mm wide; margins entire, eciliate, apices incised. Upper surface pale yellowish grey, emaculate, shiny, smooth, without isidia or phyllidia, sorediate. Soredia in coarse, laminal pustules or coralloid clusters. Medulla white. Lower surface black, densely rhizinate. Rhizines dichotomously branched, black. Apothecia and pycnidia not seen (Fig. 1). Chemistry: Cortex K\u2212, UV+ (yellow), C\u2212, KC\u2212, P\u2212; medulla K+ (reddish), C\u2212, KC+ (red), P+ (orange). TLC: chloroatranrin, lichexanthone, lividic acid, physodic acid (Fig. 2). Remarks: This species is characterized by pustulate soredia and cortical lichexanthone (yellow under UV light). According to Elix [11], Hypotrachyna novella is very closely related to H. osseoalba, but is very rare and lacks vegetative propagules.  (Fig. 3).",
