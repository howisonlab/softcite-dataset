            "text": "A n ovarian cyst is a common gynecological problem and is divided into 2 main categories; physiological and pathological. 1 Physiological cysts are follicular cysts and luteal cysts. Pathological cysts are considered as ovarian tumors, which might be benign, malignant, and borderline. Benign tumors are more common in young females, but malignant are more frequent in elderly females. 2 Most ovarian cysts are asymptomatic and disappear spontaneously. When ovarian cysts are large, they may cause abdominal discomfort. If pressing on the bladder it may also cause frequency of urination. 3 The signs and symptoms of ovarian cysts may include; pelvic pain, dysmenorrheal, and dyspareunia. Other symptoms are nausea, vomiting, or breast tenderness, fullness and heaviness in the abdomen and frequency and difficulty emptying of the bladder. 4 Patients with clear, simple ovarian cysts diagnosed by ultrasound might not require any treatment. However, monitoring using serial ultrasonography was carried out in women with simple ovarian cysts smaller than 5 cm in diameter and a normal CA 125. There is a good evidence to suggest safety of observing even a 10 cm ovarian cyst. 5,6 The aim of this study is to review cases of ovarian cysts treated at a university hospital, and to analyze the method of management and factors affecting the decision regarding the method of management (laparoscopy versus laparotomy).",

In a situation, where it has to be removed, this can be carried out laparoscopically or through a laparotomy. 16 The traditional option for ovarian cyst removal is laparotomy, and this approach is the oldest method, and is an entirely invasive procedure. Over the last 2 decades, gynecologists have aimed for less invasive procedures in the pelvis; namely, laparoscopy. The choice of which procedure to use in most cases, will be laparoscopy if possible, and laparotomy is only used if there are contraindications with the use of laparoscopy, such as cardiopulmonary disease, history of previous operations in the pelvis, known adhesion in the abdominal cavity, and late trimester of pregnancy. 17 One advantage of laparoscopic surgery of the ovary is that it is safe and effective and used for many indications for benign simple to more complicated hemorrhagic cysts, and many more gynecological problems. 18 Other advantages of laparoscopy over laparotomy include; small scar, less operative time, fast recovery, fewer adhesions, and lower cost. In addition, laparoscopy is associated with less postoperative pain, less febrile complications, a reduction in the number of days in the hospital, and total cost. 19 Certain factors such as umbilical hernia or the presence of mesh or adhesion, in cases of pregnancy, and obese patients makes laparoscopy difficult or dangerous, and the surgeon may choose laparotomy for the procedure, or non-umbilical access. 20,21 In cases where adhesions are suspected in patients with a history of abdominal surgery or infection or others, micro laparoscopy is indicated instead of a blind trocar insertion or an alternate location for entry. 22,23 Large pelvic mass, pregnancy, obesity, extreme thinness, and abdominal wall laxity all can dictate the surgeon to shift to laparotomy or use a different approach. 24 Limitations of this study included its retrospective design, and management of patient by different consultants. Future study should be prospective, and management should be by either one consultant or by a protocol followed by group of consultants to identify the relevant factors.",
