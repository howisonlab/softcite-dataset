However, these models do not capture pairwise statistical preferences of residues that are hydrogen bonded in \u03b2-sheets. We thus explore methods for incorporating pairwise dependencies into these models. Results: We consider the remote homology detection problem for \u03b2-structural motifs. In particular, we ask if a statistical model trained on members of only one family in a SCOP \u03b2-structural superfamily, can recognize members of other families in that superfamily. We show that HMMs trained with our pairwise model of simulated evolution achieve nearly a median 5% improvement in AUC for \u03b2-structural motif recognition as compared to ordinary HMMs."

Popular HMM methods such as HMMER (Eddy et al., 1998a, b) and SAM (Hughey and Krogh, 1996) have been behind the design of databases such as Pfam (Finn et al., 2006), PROSITE (Hulo et al., 2006) and SUPERFAMIILY (Wilson et al., 2007). However, a limitation of these HMMs is, since there is only finite state information about the sequence that can be held in any particular position, HMMs cannot capture dependencies that are far, and variable distance apart, in sequence.",

These residues, however, can be far away and a variable distance apart in sequence, making them impossible to capture in an HMM. Early work of Bradley et al. (Bradley et al., 2001;Cowen et al., 2002) show that these pairwise correlations help to recognize protein sequences that fold into the right-handed parallel \u03b2-helix fold. More recent work has used a conditional random field or Markov random field framework, both of which generalize HMMs beyond linear dependencies, to identify the right-handed parallel \u03b2-helix fold (Liu et al., 2009), the leucine rich repeat fold (Liu et al., 2009) and the \u03b2-propeller folds (Menke et al., 2010). * To whom correspondence should be addressed.",

In particular, we generalize our recent work (Kumar and Cowen, 2009) on augmenting HMM training data to include these very pairwise dependencies as a part of a larger training set (see below). While this method of incorporating pairwise dependencies is undoubtedly less powerful than MRF methods, it has the advantage of being simple to implement, computationally fast and allows the modular application of existing HMM software packages. We show that our augmented HMMs perform better than ordinary HMMs on the task of recognizing \u03b2-structural SCOP (Lo Conto et al., 2002) protein superfamilies. In particular, we consider the problem of how well an HMM trained on only one family \u03b2-structural SCOP superfamily can learn to recognize members of other SCOP families in that SCOP superfamily, as compared to decoys. We show a median AUC improvement of nearly 5% for our approach compared to ordinary HMMs on this task.",

(2003) and Am Busch et al. (2009) to generate these sequences are much more computationally intensive than the simple sequence-based mutation model of Kumar and Cowen. In particular, Kumar and Cowen created new training sequences by artificially adding point mutations to the original sequences in the training set, using the BLOSUM62 matrix (Eddy, 2004).

New sequences are created as follows. Residue positions contained in \u03b2-strands are selected uniformly at random. If position 'i' is selected, its pair residue 'j' is found (note that j may appear before or after 'i' in sequence) and i is mutated according to the appropriate pairwise table, conditioned on it being hydrogen bonded to the residue of type in position 'j'. This process is repeated p times and the resulting sequence is added to the augmented training set.

In this study, we set values of p that would result in training sets with 10-100% mutations (note: we allow sites to mutate more than once, for example some of the positions even a sequence with a 100% mutation rate may not end up mutated) and tested multiple values of M ranging from 10-1000.

Each match state therefore carries a vector of 20 probabilities, for scoring the 20 amino acids. The HMMs also model the gapped alignments by including insertion (I) and deletion (D) states in between the match states. The match, insertion and deletion states are connected by the transition probabilities. In our experiment, HMMER is used as a black box except the constraints on choosing match states are made tighter. Using default settings, HMMER creates a match state whenever a column in the MSA has <50% gaps. We found empirically in Kumar and Cowen (2009) that the default cutoff was not optimal for our datasets because homology was too remote, and creating a column whenever there are <20% gaps yielded the best HMMs on our datasets.

An HMM is created for every MSA, thus there is a one to one correspondence between an MSA and an HMM, generating a library of HMMs. Therefore, for any sequence from the MSA, the HMM can be used to determine if it belongs to the MSA. In addition, the HMM can be used to check if a new sequence is similar to the sequences in the MSA and if it is then one can place the new protein in the same family.

In each of the 41 cases, the training set was derived from the training sequences from the SCOP family, and the test set consisted of the sequences outside the SCOP family from the same SCOP superfamily (the positive examples) as well as an equal number of decoy sequences chosen randomly from outside the associated SCOP fold (the negative examples). For each SCOP family in the training set, we trained an ordinary HMM model and plotted the ROC curve and calculated the AUC for this task. Over all 41 families, the median AUC was 69%. We then augmented the training set with the point mutation model (Fig. 4), our new pairwise \u03b2-sheet model (Fig. 5) and using training sequences generated from both models simultaneously (Fig. 6). Figure 4 displays how the median AUC varies with the pointwise mutation rate. Similar to Kumar and Cowen, 2009, the median AUC improves by training set augmented with simulated evolution all the way up to just above a 15% mutation rate, which gives a median AUC improvement of 3.72%. When we look at the same statistics for the pairwise mutation model in Figure 5, the results are less linear with a peak 3.94% improvement at the 10% mutation rate and maximum median AUC improvement of 4.79%. Combining both types of augmented data it is the first peak of pairwise mutations combined with pointwise mutation rate of 15% that give the maximum median AUC for our experiment, an AUC improvement of 4.95%. However, the variance in different runs of this randomized procedure might mean that the best setting is sometimes here and sometimes closer to the second highest peak in Figure 6 (around 50% pairwise mutations).",

Most families show some positive increase in AUC in all augmented training models, but for around a fifth of the families performance degrades for the pointwise mutation model. The non-linearity in the median AUC as a function of mutation rate in the pairwise mutation model is partially explained by examining the proportion of families where performance improves versus degrades in Figure 8. In particular, performance degrades for <25% of the families at the 10% pairwise mutation rate, but this jumps up to 25% or more thereafter. Meanwhile the families where AUC improves with pairwise mutations shows a peak improvement level between 40 and 50% mutation rate.",

However, in this study, the biological variation is almost certainly swamped by the variation we see due to the different extent varying families within the same    superfamily are represented among solved structures in the PDB and hence the size and diversity of our test sets, as well as the difficulty of the different random decoy structures that were chosen when we constructed our datasets. Although the present study cannot therefore address exactly how to tune mutation rate parameters on a per family level, it is clear from our results that out pairwise mutation model is successful in improving the detection of remote homologs of \u03b2-structural motifs. While we cannot make any strong conclusions, we did find, as a general rule, that the pairwise mutations helped the most when there was the smallest diversity in the training sequences at a family level, that is, when there were the fewest number of known families for a given superfamily."

However, ordinary HMMs and our earlier, simpler, point mutation model of simulated evolution require only sequence information, not structure. Extending our work to the case where no solved protein strcuture is known is an interesting open question. Secondary-structure prediction programs (Rost, 2001) could be used to find \u03b2-strands, but determining how they are paired and hydrogen bonded is a much more difficult issue. Computationally predicting how \u03b2-strands are paired in the absence of structural information is a well-studied problem since 1995 (Cheng and Baldi, 2006;Hubbard and Park, 1995;Jeong et al., 2007;Steward and Thornton, 2002;Zhu and Braun, 1999). Recent work that has tried to computationally model transmembrane \u03b2-barels (Waldispuhl et al., 2008) and \u03b2-amyloids (Bryan et al., 2009) without a structural template may also be relevant.",
