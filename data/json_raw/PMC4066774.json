            "text": "Semen contains relatively ill-defined regulatory components that likely aid fertilization, but which could also interfere with defense against infection. Each ejaculate contains trillions of exosomes, membraneenclosed subcellular microvesicles, which have immunosuppressive effects on cells important in the genital mucosa. Exosomes in general are believed to mediate inter-cellular communication, possibly by transferring small RNA molecules. We found that seminal exosome (SE) preparations contain a substantial amount of RNA from 20 to 100 nucleotides (nts) in length. We sequenced 20-40 and 40-100 nt fractions of SE RNA separately from six semen donors. We found various classes of small noncoding RNA, including microRNA (21.7% of the RNA in the 20-40 nt fraction) as well as abundant Y RNAs and tRNAs present in both fractions. Specific RNAs were consistently present in all donors. For example, 10 (of \u223c2600 known) microRNAs constituted over 40% of mature microRNA in SE. Additionally, tRNA fragments were strongly enriched for 5'-ends of 18-19 or 30-34 nts in length; such tRNA fragments repress translation. Thus, SE could potentially deliver regulatory signals to the recipient mucosa via transfer of small RNA molecules."

            "text": "Human semen contains immunosuppressive agents that induce tolerance to paternal antigens and maximize the chances of successful fertilization. This helps explain the low incidence in women of antibodies against sperm and soluble components to semen (1). On the other hand, semen's immunosuppressive properties could also contribute to the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections, which may take advantage of subdued immune responses following exposure to semen (2). For example, the most globally devastating sexually transmitted disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has proven difficult to be prevented by vaccination, even with vaccine candidates that induced strong anti-HIV immunity in the bloodstream (3,4). This could be partially explained by localized immunosuppression mediated by semen at the time of initial exposure to HIV. Similarly, decreased exposure to semen through the use of condoms helps to clear active human papillomavirus infection (5), consistent with an immunosuppressive function for semen.",

The immunosuppressive fraction of semen is likely contained in seminal plasma, because isolated washed sperm cells can elicit immunity against paternal antigens, while the plasma alone promotes tolerance to paternal antigens, possibly by redirecting dendritic cells towards a tolerogenic profile (6)(7)(8). Seminal plasma contains a high concentration of subcellular lipid-bound microparticles, traditionally termed prostasomes, because the majority of them were thought to derive from epithelial cells in the prostate gland (9). However, these microparticles likely originate from multiple cellular sources in the male genital tract (10) and are morphologically and molecularly consistent with exosomes, so we use the term 'seminal exosomes' (SE). SE have already been implicated as immunosuppressive, inhibiting lymphoproliferative responses (2), the activity of phagocytic cells (11) and natural killer cell function (12). Thus, the immunosuppressive properties of seminal plasma appear to reside at least in large part within its exosome fraction.",

They can be taken up by specific target cells via membrane surface proteins, and though exosomes were initially thought to be non-specific waste from cells, evidence that exosomes are important mediators of intercellular communication is rapidly accumulating. Depending on the cell type of origin, exosomes can be involved in both immune stimulation and tolerization. For example, tumor-derived exosomes have been shown to suppress immune responses, promote metastasis, and confer drug resistance to recipient cells in cancer (13)(14)(15). In contrast, dendritic cell-derived exosomes loaded with infectious disease antigens can induce immune responses (16)(17)(18). The exosomal cargo mediating effects on recipient cells includes cytokines, growth factors and membrane proteins, as well as both messenger and microRNA (19). MicroRNAs (miR-NAs) regulate biological functions through degradation or inhibition of specific mRNA targets (20)(21)(22)(23)(24). Other small non-coding RNAs carried by exosomes could also act as regulatory elements (25)(26)(27). Fragments of transfer RNA (tRNA), for example, can non-specifically inhibit protein translation or function as miRNAs by binding components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (28)(29)(30).",

In contrast to blood plasma and cell culture supernatant, where only a minor fraction of miRNA appears contained within exosomes (31,32), about half of extracellular RNA in seminal plasma purified with the exosomal fraction rather than the exosome-depleted supernatant. We then comprehensively surveyed exosomal small RNAs by deep sequencing, finding that known human miRNAs are carried by SE.

Samples were ultra-centrifuged at 100 000 \u00d7 g for 90 min at 4 \u2022 C in an SW 50 swinging bucket rotor (Beckman). The upper layer was collected and ultracentrifuged again at 100 000 \u00d7 g for 14 h at 4 \u2022 C over a 20 mM Tris/25% sucrose/D 2 O cushion (pH 7.4). The upper layer of exosome-depleted seminal plasma was stored at \u221280 \u2022 C. The 30% and 25% sucrose cushions containing the exosome fraction were pooled and brought to 15 ml with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The exosomes were washed by centrifuging at 2400 \u00d7 g through an Amicon Ultracel 100 kDa cellulose centrifugal filter with 10 ml of PBS and concentrated to a final volume of 425 l-3.2 ml. Exosomes were stored at \u221280 \u2022 C.",

We found that SE carry an average of 1477 ng of RNA (range 215-3534 ng, n = 8 semen donations) per sample. To test how much RNA in filtered seminal plasma is associated with the exosome fraction, we compared RNA content in three pools of SE, isolated from three separate donors each (nine donors total), with their respective pooled SEdepleted plasmas. Isolated exosomes contained an average of 55% of the total RNA isolated from our samples. The remaining 45% was in the exosome-depleted supernatant (Figure 2A). To show that the SE-associated RNA is carried within intact exosomes, we treated a part of these same samples with either RNAse alone, or with protease followed by RNAse, or with detergent followed by protease then RNAse. More than 88% of RNA in the exosome fractions was protected from combined RNAse/protease digestion. Treatment with detergent to lyse exosomes prior to protease and RNAse treatment resulted in a loss of 83% of the RNA. (Figure 2A). In contrast, 47% of RNA in the seminal plasma fraction was degraded with RNAse/protease treatment alone, confirming that much of this RNA is not protected by vesicles. These data show that a substantial fraction of extracellular RNA in 0.22 m filtered seminal plasma is exosome-associated and that the majority of SEassociated RNA is enclosed and protected within intact microvesicles or protein complexes.",

Because a substantial fraction of exosomal RNA was <100 nt in size, and within that size range there were two clearly distinguishable peaks (20-40 nt and 40-100 nt) ( Figure 2B), we prepared and sequenced the RNA in two separate size fractions encompassing the two peaks.

Mapped RNA was analyzed separately by biotype, and total reads for ribosomal RNA, tRNA, miRNA, piwi-RNA, Y RNA and protein-coding mRNA are given in Table 1. The distribution of reads corresponding to the RNA biotypes correlated highly between donors for the larger size-fraction libraries (median Spearman's = 0.96, range 0.89-1.0) ( Table 2 and Supplemental Table S2) and less so for the smaller size-fraction libraries (median Spearman = 0.46, range 0.25-0.89) ( Table 3 and Supplemental Table S3).

            "text": "As expected, the 20-40 nt and 40-100 nt RNA fractions exhibited some notable differences in RNA biotypes (Figure 2C). An average of 21.7% of mappable RNA in the smaller size fractions was identified as miRNA. The larger size fractions contained only 2.89% miRNA. The larger size libraries should have carried only pre-miRNA hairpins, which are \u223c70 nt long, and indeed the guide and passenger strands were present in approximately equal abundance in the larger libraries, indicating that the miRNA in the larger size fractions was primarily pre-miRNA. Piwi-RNA, which has a size range of 26-31 nt (44), was present in the smaller RNA fraction (mean 2.75%) and, as expected, was almost undetectable in the larger fractions (0.03%). Fulllength tRNA ranges from 73 to 94 nt and therefore was expected in the larger fractions, where tRNA reads accounted for 5.93% of the RNA. Surprisingly, sequences mapping to tRNA were also found in abundance in the smaller libraries, accounting for 16.02% of the sequencing reads, implying that some tRNAs are fragmented in SE. Similarly, Y RNA, the 83-112 nt long non-coding RNA component    9%). However, the miRNAs present in some but not all six donors were at extremely low abundance, never individually representing more than 0.05% of miRNA-specific sequencing reads in any given donor (Supplemental File 1). The distribution of reads mapping to each of the 175 mature miRNA species common to all six donors correlated highly between donors (median Spearman's = 0. 86, range 0.78-0.92) (Supplemental Table S4). The most abundant miRNA in all donors was let-7b, accounting for a mean of 19.5% of the total miRNA reads (median 20.1%, range 13.7-25.1%) ( Figure 3A). Let-7b and the next four most abundant miRNAs (miR-148a, let-7a, miR-375 and miR-99a) together accounted for 33.1% of the total miRNA reads (median 33.0%, range 29.7-37.7%), and adding in the next five most abundant miRNAs covered 41.8% of total miRNA reads (median 42.9%, range 37.9-43.7%) ( Figure  3A). We validated the hierarchical miRNA distribution derived from the sequencing reads by quantifying the first through fifth most abundant miRNas (let-7b, miR-148, let-7a, miR-375 and miR-99a) as well as two randomly selected miRNAs with much lower read counts (miR-28 and miR- RNA was isolated from three additional SE samples that had not been sequenced and assayed for miRNA levels by ddPCR assay. The five highest abundant (by sequencing) and two low abundance miRNAs were tested. Counts per l of input cDNA are shown for each of the three donors. All reactions were run in triplicate with extremely low standard deviations (error bars always fell within each symbol and are not shown for better visual clarity). miR28 was analyzed in two donors only. 103), using ddPCR assays with RNA isolated from SE from three additional, unsequenced donors. We confirmed the overall general hierarchical distribution of miRNAs, with the two lower abundant miRNAs by sequencing counts also being much lower by ddPCR copy number counts (on average 15 [miR-103] and 89 [miR-28] fold lower than the five most abundant miRNAs) ( Figure 3B). These data demonstrate high consistency of miRNA loading into SE from different healthy semen donors, with only a few select miRNA species being present in abundance.",

Within these top 10 miRNAs there was one family with an identical 5' end seed regions: let-7b/7a, suggesting the possibility that some specific mRNA sequences are targeted by multiple SE-associated miRNAs. The current scientific literature indicates that a number of mRNA sequences that translate to immunity-related proteins could be regulated by miRNAs among the list of the top 10 miRNAs (Table 4) (50-61). Thus, it is feasible that the few abundant miRNAs in SE could influence pathways important for the immunophysiology of the genital tract.

Y RNAs are known as components of the autoantigen ribonucleoprotein complexes targeted by antibodies from patients with Sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (62). Their physiological functions are poorly characterized, though they are reported to be involved in chromosomal DNA replication, in the response to UV damage, and in regulating small RNA biogenesis (63)(64)(65)(66)(67)(68)(69). Humans have four types of Y RNAs: hY1, hY3, hY4 and hY5, all of which are present in SE ( Figure 4A). Sequencing reads demonstrate the pres-ence of both full-length or \u226550 nt fragments (in the larger size-fractionated libraries) and smaller fragmented Y RNA forms (<50 nts, in the smaller size-fractionated libraries), but the relative distribution of Y RNA types differed between the two libraries. The majority of Y RNA in both libraries was hY4. The larger library contained about 30% hY5, while the smaller library contained almost no hY5. Both libraries contained small amounts of hY1 and hY3 ( Figure 4A). The ratios of larger to smaller fragmented Y RNA read counts for the four Y RNA types were extremely consistent between the six donors ( Table 5). Many Y RNAs in both size fractions mapped to genomic sequences annotated as pseudogenes and predicted genes (Supplemental File 2). For all four Y RNA types, smaller fragment lengths consistently centered around 30-33 nt ( Supplemental Figure S1A). For hY1, hY3 and hY5, >95% of the smaller fragments mapped to the 5' ends of Y RNA, while for hY4 \u223c80% of the smaller fragments mapped to the 5' end and 20% mapped to the 3' end (Supplemental Figure S1B). These data indicate that each Y RNA type is loaded into SE in a distinctive manner, implying a selective process.",

            "text": "Though exosomes can transfer mRNAs capable of translation to target cells (20,71), it is thought that the majority of protein-coding RNA in exosomes is fragmented (26). Because we focused on sequencing small RNAs, our analysis does not include full-length mRNA in SE, but we did find protein-coding mRNA fragments of various sizes, accounting for 5.3% of the total sequencing reads in the larger libraries and 9.2% in the smaller ( Figure 2C). In contrast to miRNA, Y RNA and tRNA, the distribution of the 80 most abundant mRNA fragments was much more variable between donors (median Spearman's = 0.18 range 0.11-0.22, for the larger size fractions; = 0.20 range 0.16-0.26, for the smaller size fractions) ( Supplemental Tables S7 and  S8). Only one mRNA fragment, ENST0000360737, corresponding to an uncharacterized protein, was abundant in the libraries (Table 7), accounting for over 50% of the protein-coding reads in the smaller libraries. This transcript also contains the newly described miR-4763, however the fragments carried by SE map to a 24 bp region of the 3' UTR and not to the miRNA sequence. Other abundant protein-coding fragments are listed in Table 7. The remaining majority of protein-coding fragments in SE each represented <1% of total protein-coding reads. Despite this  diversity, the relatively more abundant fragments mapped to only one small segment in the 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of the mRNA (Table 7), rather than randomly across sequences as would be expected if fragments were non-selectively packaged into SE. Of interest, we could not identify any of the mRNA sequences loaded into SE as potential target sequences for the co-loaded miRNAs, indicating that mRNA and miRNA molecules in SE do not associate with each other.",

            "text": "Sexual intercourse is the primary route of transmission for many infections. Semen, beyond simply carrying pathogens, has well-documented immunosuppressive effects which may influence the infection of new hosts (72). The precise impact of semen on cellular functions important in pathogen response remains poorly understood and is complicated by the fact that unfractionated seminal plasma contains many components, some of which can enhance and others inhibit viral infection of mucosal cells (7,(72)(73)(74)(75)(76)(77)(78). Thus, the overall role semen plays in infectious disease de-pends on multiple complex factors in semen itself as well as the interactions of these factors with the specific pathogens and with resident genital tract cells. Given that exosomes are demonstrated agents of immune information (79), and that small RNAs in exosomes can affect target cells (80), we explored the small RNA content of SE for potential immunomodulatory features. We have established a protocol to isolate SE from semen, which consistently results in 10 12 or more purified particles per ejaculate. These particles have the characteristics of exosomes and microvesicles: (i) lipid-bound round shape and size of 40-200 nm, (ii) purify in a density of 1.10-1.27 g/cm 3 and (iii) express common exosome markers CD63 and HSP70 and lack expression of the endoplasmic-reticulum marker calnexin (Figure 1 A-C). We were surprised that a substantial fraction of RNA in 0.22 m filtered seminal plasma was found in the exosomal fraction, because this is in contrast to findings from blood plasma and cell culture supernatant, where the majority of extracellular RNA and particularly miRNA appears independent of exosomes (21)(22)(23)(24)31,32). The RNA in SE was particularly enriched for small RNAs ranging in lengths from 20 to 100 nts (Figure 2A and B). By deep sequencing of these small RNAs, we found that their repertoire included miRNAs with known immunomodulatory functions, as well as other small non-coding RNAs representing short, <50 nt fragments and larger, possibly fulllength, fragments of >50 nts.",

However, most of these experiments were conducted in somewhat artificial conditions and the relevance of this kind of messaging in vivo has yet to be demonstrated. The concentration of individual RNA molecules in each exosome is very small, and whether they can be delivered to the proper location in cells in sufficient quantities to actually regulate cellular targets in vivo remains unclear (19,81). In contrast to exosomes from blood plasma, however, exosomes in semen are delivered at a high concentration to a limited anatomical area--the recipient female genital tract. Our preliminary evidence suggests that phagocytic cells of the genital mucosa preferentially take up exosomes (data not shown). Based on measurement of the size of the vaginal cavity (82), the density of intraepithelial dendritic cells (Langerhans cells) (83) and the high number of SE in each ejaculate it is feasible that phagocytes in the recipient genital tract are exposed to and could take up thousands to tens of thousands of SE per cell, likely above the threshold for triggering physiological effects. Experiments to clarify this hypothesis are in progress in our laboratory.",

In this work we describe in SE the presence of piwi-RNA, a small RNA species expressed primarily in germline cells (84), implying that some SE are derived from spermatozoa. Additionally, polyclonal antisera that were raised against SE suggested a polytopic origin of the microvesicles, because when used for immunostaining the antisera reacted with testes, the epididymis, accessory sex glands and the prostate (10). Thus, since the complex makeup of SE cannot be mimicked by a single cell culture system, we could not compare the small RNA profiles of SE to their cells of origin. However, based on similar sequencing studies comparing exosomes and the cells that make them, it is likely that the RNA content of SE is also distinct from the cells of origin and that small RNAs are specifically packaged and secreted in SE, potentially for the purpose of altering the function of target cells (21,27,70).",

By sequencing two distinct RNA size fractions, we easily distinguished between mature and pre-miRNA and found that SE contained mature miRNAs and also pre-miRNA. miRNA accounted for \u223c21.7% of the total sequencing reads in our smaller size fractions (Figure 2C). Only a small subset of miRNAs are packaged in SE; of 2578 known human miRNAs, 175 mature miRNAs were found in all six semen donors and 434 were detected at greater than the detection threshold in at least one donor. The abundance of specific miRNAs was remarkably consistent between SE isolated from different donors; the correlation coefficient of sequencing reads of the 175 common miRNAs was >0.78 for all donors (Supplemental Table S4). Furthermore, only a few miRNAs accounted for the majority of sequencing reads ( Figure 3A). A comparison of sequencing studies of miRNA in exosomes isolated from saliva, breast milk, dendritic cell-T cell co-cultures, human blood plasma, prion-infected cells, glioma cells and trophoblast cultures show that SE share at most 3 of the 10 most abundant miRNAs (21,27,70,(85)(86)(87)(88)(89). Let-7b is the most common, being an abundant exosomal miRNA in five of these eight studies, with miR-30d found in four of eight. Thus, the profile of abundant miRNAs carried by exosomes varies according to their cell of origin and may represent the different functions of exosomes in various body systems. Accordingly, exosomes in semen exhibited a unique miRNA profile that differed markedly from the profiles found in exosomes of other origins.",

Hu et al. (90) focused on RNAs differing between the unfractionated seminal plasma from vasectomized and normal men, making a comparison to our study difficult, though 89% of miRNAs they found were also found in our study. Belleannee et al. (92) used a microarray approach to identify known miRNAs in microvesicles isolated from semen. They report 293 miRNAs detected in SE pooled from normal men; in comparison we detected 175 present in all donors, and another 271 in at least one donor. Microarray and RNAseq technologies have platform-inherent biases and the reliability of miRNA quantification likely differs between these two approaches (93). Nevertheless, we found a notable degree of overlap between the miRNAs they report and those we found; for example, all of our top 10 most abundant miRNAs are within the top 100 ranked miRNAs in their study, and the top 10 from their study are all within our top 85. The third study by Li et al. (91) suggested that in contrast to our study seminal miRNAs are mostly in the supernatant rather than the vesicle-associated fraction of seminal plasma. The authors base this conclusion on only four particular miRNAs tested (detected by qPCR), which represent <0.02% of miRNA reads in our study. This very limited universe of miRNAs studied may explain why their conclusions differed from ours.",

Sequences that mapped to Y RNA transcripts in Ensembl fell into one of three categories: (i) the four human Y RNAs (hY1, hY2, hY3 and hY5), (ii) pseudogenes from the four human genes and (iii) Y RNAs predicted in the Rfam database (94).

These complexes have also been found in exosomes secreted by epithelial cells derived from salivary glands, which are the main target organs for autoimmunity in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (99). Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and SLE occur nearly 10 times as frequently in women than men, and clinical onset of SLE is most often between 15 and 35 years of age when sexual activity begins and is highest. It is therefore tempting to hypothesize that exposure to RNPs carried by SE plays a role in triggering or maintaining SLE in young women.",

Many studies have demonstrated that tRNA fragmentation is a specific process that depends on cell type and cell state, and tRNA fragments have recently gained attention for their regulatory potential and a possible role in stress response (25,102,103). In mammalian cells, the stress-activated ribonuclease angiogenin cleaves tRNAs in or near the anti-codon internal loop to generate fragments of 30-34 nt, known as tRNA halves (104). The 5' ends of these tRNA halves inhibit translation by displacing components of the translation initiation complex (105). We find 5' end tRNA fragments, predominantly 30-34 nt tRNA halves derived from tRNA-Gly and tRNA-Val, consistent with angiogenin cleavage, in SE (Figure 5b). Though only nine different 5'-tRNA fragments were tested, tRNA-Gly halves, which are the most abundant tRNA fragments in SE, were one of the few found to be significant repressors of translation (105). Additionally, smaller tRNA fragments of 19 nt have also been shown to inhibit translation non-specifically (106). These fragments require a GG motif in the 3' end of the molecule to repress translation, which is present in the 19 nt tRNA-Ala fragments we observe in SE. Thus, multiple tRNA fragments found in SE could globally and non-specifically inhibit translation in cells that take up SE. In addition, some 3'-derived tRNA fragments have been found to be associated with argonaute proteins and thus potentially act as miRNAs. However, we Nucleic Acids Research, 2014, Vol. 42, No. 11 7301 observed very few 3' tRNA fragments in SE, so tRNAderived specific translation repression mediated by SE is unlikely.",

The mRNA fragments we detected in SE were not individually abundant, with the vast majority of transcripts each accounting for <1% of the total reads attributed to protein-coding RNA ( Table 5). In addition to the diversity of different transcripts in SE, mRNA fragments found in SE were diverse across donors, with the lowest correlations of sequencing counts for any RNA biotype analyzed (Supplemental Tables S7 and S8). However, it is unlikely that these RNAs are non-selectively incorporated into SE, because for most transcripts very specific small fragments of mRNA corresponding to only one region were found, rather than fragments spread over entire transcripts ( Table 5). We found that all protein-coding fragments that represented over 2% of the reads in this category mapped to untranslated rather than coding regions ( Table 5). Small untranslated mRNA fragments have been proposed to play a role in regulating translation of their matching transcripts (26), though whether the particular mRNA fragments in SE function in this way are unknown.",

The discrepancy between tRNA and Y RNA types in the larger and smaller libraries in SE further suggests a selective loading process beyond simply reflecting abundance in the cells or origin. For tRNA and Y RNA, 5' end fragments generated by cleavage in predicted internal loops in the secondary RNA structures appear to be preferentially loaded into SE. The 5' ends of cleaved nucleic acids are likely to be 5'-monophosphates, while the 5' ends of 3' fragments are more likely to be hydroxyl groups (104). miRNAs and piwi-RNAs have 5' monophosphates as well. Thus the structural predilection for 5'-monophosphate ends could hold clues regarding the mechanism of selective RNA loading into exosomes, occurring either by selection of molecules with 5' phosphates during the process of loading or merely by providing increased stability and longevity. More research will be required to clarify how small RNA molecules are selectively loaded into exosomes.",

We found that RNA loading into SE is a biologically consistent and highly selective process, with very little variation between different semen donors. Many of the most abundant small RNAs in SE have important regulatory potential for target cells that take up exosomes. Given the rapidly accumulating evidence that exosomes in other systems can deliver regulatory RNAs, and that SE carry a unique and selective profile of RNAs, it will be interesting to study their functional consequences on immune cells in the mucosa in detail. This may lead to a better understanding of how exosomal RNA-mediated reg-ulation contributes to fertilization, but also how it may compromise natural or vaccine-induced immunity to infection."
