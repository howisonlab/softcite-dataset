Upon intravenous injection, nanoparticles are coated by a protein corona (PC). This confers a new biological identity on the particles that largely determines their biological fate. Liposomes have great pharmaceutical versatility, so, as proof of concept, their PC has recently been implicated in the mechanism and efficiency of their internalization into the cell. In an attempt to better understand the interactions between nanocarriers and biological systems, we analyzed the plasma proteins adsorbed on the surface of multicomponent liposomes. Specifically, we analyzed the physical properties and ultrastructure of liposome/PC complexes and the aggregation process that occurs when liposomes are dispersed in plasma. The results of combined confocal microscopy and flow cytometry experiments demonstrated that the PC favors liposome internalization by both macrophages and tumor cells. This work provides insights into the effects of the PC on liposomes' physical properties and, consequently, liposome-liposome and liposome-cell interactions.",

In fact, by increasing their pharmaceutical bioavailability and targeting, NPs avoid systemic toxicity while retaining pharmacological activity. 1 After intravenous injection, NPs adsorb a multitude of biological molecules (proteins, lipids, glycans, and metabolites) from plasma on their surface. These biomole cules continuously recycle 2,3 on the NP surface, thereby forming a dynamic shell known as a \"biomolecular corona.\" 4 Most research studying the biomolecular corona has focused on protein composition characterization: 5,6 therefore, the biomolecular corona is generally called the \"protein corona\" (PC). 7,8 This natural coating provides NPs with a new biological identity and significantly affects their fate, pharmacokinetics, and cellular interactions.",

            "text": "In terms of NP targeting abilities, the PC can 1) hinder the function of targeting ligands attached to the NP surface, thereby reducing their accumulation in the targeted tissue, 3,9,10 and 2) modify the carrier surface, facilitating cell internalization. 11 The PC can also modulate immune response. 12 Several studies have characterized PC structure, function, and formation dynamics. 13,14 Structurally, proteins that are weakly bound to the NP surface form the \"soft corona,\" while proteins strongly bound to the NP surface form the \"hard corona.\" 15,16 Functionally, the PC is characterized by the presence of opsonins (complement proteins), immunoglobulins, and lectins, 17 which match to correspondence: ennio Tasciotti; claudia corbo center for Biomimetic Medicine, houston Methodist research Institute, 6670 Bertner avenue, houston, TX 77030, Usa Tel +1 713 441 7319; +1 713 363 9763 email etasciotti@houstonmethodist.org; corbo@ceinge.unina.it specific receptors on leukocyte membranes. Until recently, NP opsonization was considered part of the body's defense mechanism by inducing NP clearance from circulation and consequent accumulation in the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system (mainly spleen and liver). 18 However, in a recent study, unfolded proteins that promote macrophage uptake or their shielding by other proteins in the PC were found to reduce in vitro particle uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages. 19,20 The particular context, therefore, needs to be discussed when considering cellular uptake. Although the biological identity of NPs largely determines their biological fate, their physical identity (ie, shape, size, and surface charge) strictly regulates NP-cell interactions. Indeed, large NPs (.300 nm) with a higher positive or negative surface charge (, -15 mV or . +15 mV) exhibited increased macrophage uptake, in vitro and in vivo. 21,22 The scope of this work was to shed light on the interactions occurring at the interface between nanocarriers and biological systems. To this aim, we evaluated liposomes as proof-ofconcept NPs, given their widespread use in the pharmaceutical field and their high versatility. While most research into the PC has studied inorganic NPs, only recently the PC of liposomes is emerging as a fundamental entity regulating the interactions of liposomes with living systems. 23 The PC is believed to have a potentially key impact on targeted delivery in nanomedicine, as it could be manipulated by using different liposomal formulations. Herein, we selected multicomponent choline-based liposomes as a model system to study the PC's effects in targeted drug delivery applications. 24 We studied the correlation between the biological and physical identity of liposomes. To investigate the physical changes occurring in liposomes after PC formation, we characterized NP-PC complexes and used proteomics to analyze the PC composition. Lastly, in an attempt to reproduce the environment surrounding NPs upon systemic injection, we investigated the interactions between liposome-PC complexes and two cell lines in vitro. We studied the impact of the PC composition on liposome uptake by the main cell population responsible for clearance of foreign materials (macrophages J774 cells) and by cancer cells (breast cancer 4T1 cells).",

The film was then hydrated with ultrapure distilled water to obtain a lipid concentration of 20 mM.

All measurements were subjected to first-order flattening. Particle size was calculated using the Nanoscope 6.13R1 software (Digital Instruments, NY, USA). Mean values from 40 random particles in three independent experiments are reported. Quantitative AFM force mapping analysis was performed to evaluate the relative elasticity of particles in order to obtain a complete elastic property map of heterogeneous samples. We prepared samples by coating the mica surface sample holder with 0.1% (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) to stabilize the NPs (to prevent their collapse on the mica surface), and then performed the AFM analysis. Young's modulus was calculated for six different samples corresponding to 512\u00d7512 force-separation curves obtained over a 10\u00d710 \u03bcm area. Young's modulus was calculated using the following equation, as reported elsewhere: 28",

As mentioned earlier, PC formation is a dynamic process. 38 Our analysis showed a heterogeneous scenario as a snapshot of the overall mechanism. The smaller particles found in the liposome-PC complex sample represent single particle-PC complexes. AFM analysis revealed that these individual liposome/PC complexes were stiffer than bare liposomes but softer than liposome-PC aggregates ( Figure S1). According to this finding, we speculate that once each liposome is covered by the first PC layer, it becomes adhesive, thereby inducing aggregation into larger clusters. 39 Moreover, the analysis of the elastic map revealed another protein adsorption process on the particle cluster that we call the \"outer corona\" (Figure 2E). In addition, although the cluster itself is stiffer than bare liposomes, there are some areas underneath the outer corona that are less stiff ( Figure S2). However, these softer areas remain stiffer than the bare liposomes (green) and are, instead, very similar in value to those of single liposome-PC complexes ( Figure S1). Therefore, we hypothesize a nonhomogeneous presence of the outer corona due to this difference in topographical arrangement. We speculate that formation of the outer corona might be triggered by the size of the PC rather than by its composition ( Figure S3).",

The 20 most abundant proteins adsorbed on the liposome surface after exposure to murine plasma are shown in Figure 3C, while the mass spectrometry profiles of the identified proteins are listed in Table S1. Overall, most PC components were small, negatively charged proteins (.70% with molecular weight [MW] ,60 kDa, Figure 4A, and .70% with isoeletric point [pI] ,6.5, Figure 4B). A previous study showed that negatively charged particles preferentially attract positively charged proteins. 40,41 Contrary to our expectation, negatively charged proteins preferentially adsorbed on our negatively charged liposomes. A similar trend was reported by others, 42,43 and it supports the idea that predictions of PC composition exclusively based on NP charge are too simplistic. Electrostatic interactions are not the only force that drives NP-PC interactions. Many other factors (eg, protein abundance in plasma, the presence of a functional group on the NP surface, plasma type, and incubation time) affect PC composition. On the other hand, neutral and positive proteins are also present in the PC, though in small percents ( Figure 4B). Considering our observation discussed above on the formation of a nonhomogenous corona, we believe that it is possible that these proteins create small positive charges or neutral patches on the particles' surface, which facilitates aggregation by electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions.",

We used mouse J774 macrophages ( Figure 5A) and mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells ( Figure 5B) as proof-of-concept models for this in vitro study. We treated both cell lines with fluorescent particles, and then examined their interactions with NPs using confocal microscopy. The uptake of liposomes with a PC was greater than that of bare liposomes in both cell lines. Moreover, large particle aggregates formed in PC-endowed liposomes but not in bare liposomes (white arrows in Figure S4).",

            "text": "To determine the fraction of particles internalized by J774 and 4T1 cells, we carried out a flow cytometry analysis, in which cells were quenched with trypan blue to obscure the fluorescence associated with the cell surface. As shown in Figure 6, the quantitative analysis confirmed the increased uptake of liposomes with a PC. These results concur with studies of NP uptake by immune 45 and tumor cells. 46 Data on the impact of the PC on the biological fate of NPs are controversial. Since PC formation is a highly dynamic process, it is difficult to envisage a unique explanation of the interfacial events that occur between the PC and biological components. For several decades, cell opsonization was considered the body's first defense mechanism against foreign entities, 47 but recent studies have shown that the PC can shield particles from the action of adsorbed serum components (IgG and complement factors) that normally favor particle clearance. 19,20 Here we report increased liposome uptake by both J774 and 4T1 cells after plasma incubation. We hypothesize that complement factors and apolipoproteins present in the PC are mainly responsible for this effect. Complement proteins, together with immunoglobulins and coagulation factors, mediate particle uptake through interactions with complement Fc and Toll-like receptors on the macrophage surface. 47 On the other hand, apolipoproteins belong to the family of lipoproteins, which are key players in the cholesterol metabolism process, through which they stimulate cancer cell growth. 48 Cholesterol availability is crucial for the proliferation of rapidly dividing cancer cells. Breast cancer cells, like other cancer cells, express B-class scavenger receptors on their surface, 49 which are intermediate in lipid transfer between lipoproteins and cells. 50 We believe that the functional motifs of these proteins are exposed on the PC, in the correct orientation to perform their function and to be recognized by their specific cell receptors, allowing PC-mediated cell internalization. These findings explain the impact of the PC, ie, the liposome's new biological identity, on cellular uptake. On the other hand, our DLS, cryo-EM, and AFM experiments conducted to characterize liposomes provide insights into the impact of the PC also on the liposome's new physical identity. We found that PC formation induces liposome aggregation, which implies the presence of clusters of NPs (Table 1, Figure 2) that coexist with single liposome-PC complexes, consistent with what has been demonstrated elsewhere. 51,52 This means that cells interact not only with single particles surrounded by a PC through a receptor-mediated pathway but also with particles in the form of larger aggregates. The latter are likely to be internalized via phagocytosis, particularly in the case of macrophages, which would explain why we observed a major uptake by cells ( Figure 7).",

            "text": "In the last decade, the biological components of synthetic NPs have attracted the attention of the scientific community because of the fundamental role they play in the interaction between particles and cells. Several assertions have been made to describe the PC's composition and correlate it to NP uptake by immune and cancer cells. Thus far, the results have been controversial due to the variability of the experimental settings (particle chemical composition, plasma source, plasma concentration, particle incubation time, cell lines, etc). 8 In this study, we reported the structure, composition, and biological effect of PCs adsorbed on multicomponent liposomes. We found that the formation of a PC on liposomes makes their surface adhesive, thus inducing the formation of particle clusters that coexist with single vesicles. We also showed that internalization of liposome-PC complexes by both macrophages and cancer cells was greater than that of control liposomes. The presence of a PC strongly affects the NP's biological response. This can be due to 1) the presence of molecules (ie, immunoglobulins and apolipoproteins) in the PC that recognize specific receptors on the surface of immune and cancer cells, and/or 2) the formation of NP cluster that induce phagocytosis by the cells, or 3) a combination of these effects.",

Our observations suggest that to predict the fate of a NP in vivo, one must not only know the PC composition and eventually the orientation of proteins, but should also carefully consider the physical changes (size, surface, and charge) that the NP undergoes when surrounded by a PC and the consequent impact on particle-particle interactions. This study shows that the efficacy of liposomal formulations must be reinterpreted, as it is strongly affected by PC formation in plasma. Classical characterization of nanodelivery systems should include studies on PC formation and be combined with experiments that simulate the tendency of NPs to aggregate after exposure to plasma proteins. We believe that such studies will hopefully help us interpret and predict in vivo data and to design more effective therapeutic carriers.",
