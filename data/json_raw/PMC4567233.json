Methods: From November 2011 to January 2014, 109 patients newly diagnosed with HCC with an HBV DNA level less than 2,000 IU/mL were enrolled in the study. These patients underwent at least two TACE procedures and were followed-up for at least 3 months to assess the reactivation of HBV DNA. Ten variables were compared in patients with and without HBV reactivation to evaluate the factors related to HBV reactivation in HCC patients with low serum HBV DNA level. Results: Of 109 HCC patients with low level HBV DNA, nine patients were HBeAg-positive, the other 100 patients were HBeAg-negative. Twenty-three of 109 (21.1%) patients developed HBV reactivation after TACE. Of nine HBeAg-positive patients, 55.6% (5/9) developed HBV reactivation, while in 100 HBeAg-negative patients, the rate of HBV reactivation was 18% (18/100) (P=0.019). Of ten variables of patients with low level HBV DNA, the levels of AFP and HBeAg status were found to be significantly correlated with HBV reactivation. Nevertheless, on binary logistic regression analysis, only HBeAg-positive status was the independent predictor of HBV reactivation in HCC patients with low serum HBV DNA level (odds ratio, 7.41; P=0.013). Conclusion: HCC patients with low serum HBV DNA level still remain associated with risk of viral reactivation after TACE, and HBeAg-positive HCC patients have a higher risk than patients with HBeAg-negative status.",

            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the seventh most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world according to the GloboCan 2008. 1 Most of the cases arise in Asia and Africa, and the People's Republic of China alone accounts for 55% of cases of HCC worldwide. 2 The major risk factor for HCC in the People's Republic of China is chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. 3 Compared with patients with hepatitis C virus, patients with HBV tend to have less surveillance and more advanced stages of HCC, 4 which often precludes surgical options with curative intent such as resection and transplantation. Accordingly, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) currently is considered as the mainstay of therapy for nonsurgical HCC. 5 Transarterial chemotherapy can reactivate HBV replication in patients with HBV-related HCC. [6][7][8] Pre-emptive antiviral therapy should be considered in HCC patients with high-level viremia. 8 The Asian-Pacific Association for the Study of Liver recommends that pre-emptive antiviral therapy should be initiated in all HCC patients who are to undergo TACE. 9 However, universal application of this strategy is costly and burdensome, especially as antiviral therapy for carriers of inactive HBV is not reimbursed by health insurance in the People's Republic of China, so pre-emptive antiviral therapy is often used in patients with serum HBV DNA level more than 2,000 IU/mL, and not widely used for patients with low level serum HBV DNA. To date, the data on viral reactivation following TACE in Chinese HBV-related HCC patients with low serum HBV DNA level are limited.",

In Asia, the role of TACE is further extended to include the treatment of advanced HCC. TACE currently is considered as the mainstay of therapy for nonsurgical HCC. It is now well-known that transarterial chemotherapy can reactivate HBV replication in HBV-related HCC patients with high baseline HBV DNA level. However, before 2004, studies on HBV reactivation in HCC patients receiving transarterial chemotherapy were lacking. 6 In the last decade, a series of studies on HBV reactivation in patients with HCC following TACE was published. [6][7][8] The risk of HBV reactivation in transarterial therapy was reportedly 22%-40%. HBeAg-positive and a baseline HBV DNA level of more than 2,000 IU/mL were regarded as independent predictors of HBV reactivation. 7,8 In the present study, HBV reactivation after TACE in HCC patients with HBV DNA level of less than 2,000 IU/mL was investigated. Twenty-three of 109 (21.1%) HCC patients with HBV DNA ,2,000 IU/mL developed HBV reactivation after TACE. This implies that HBV reactivation should not be overlooked in patients with low levels of viremia. Furthermore, in the present study, HBeAg-positive status was found to be the only independent predictor of HBV reactivation, and 55.6% (5/9) of HBeAg-positive patients experienced HBV reactivation.

            "text": "Another finding of our present study is that five (14.3%, 5/35) patients who were receiving antiviral therapy experienced HBV reactivation. The incidence of HBV reactivation in patients who had antiviral history and were on antiviral therapy in our study was higher than those who had no antiviral history but were using pre-emptive antiviral agents reported in a previous study. This was a puzzling finding because a previous study had reported excellent efficacy of pre-emptive lamivudine therapy in HCC patients undergoing chemo-lipiodolization. 7 The reason for this finding may be the emergence of viral resistance. Unfortunately, no analysis on viral resistance was done in our present study, so the hypothesis could not be proved. There are some limitations in our study. Firstly, the time of follow-up on HBV reactivation after TACE is short, so some cases of HBV reactivation caused by repeated TACE procedures may have been excluded. Secondly, the proportion of patients who were excluded from analysis due to follow-up loss within 3 months after the first TACE procedure was high (35.1%, 59/168); only 109 patients were left for HBV reactivation analysis and only nine patients were HBeAg-positive for subgroup analysis, which may lead to bias because of the small group.",

HBeAg-positive status was the only independent predictor of HBV reactivation in HCC patients with low serum HBV DNA level. Special attention should be paid to patients who have antiviral history with lamivudine, because viral reactivation could still occur in those patients. Study results suggest that pre-emptive antiviral therapy is necessary for HCC patients with low serum HBV DNA level.",
