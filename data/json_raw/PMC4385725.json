            "text": "Oral health generally has the effect on the general health of the individual and ultimately affects well-being, education, and development. In many countries, parents and their children's are not aware of the basic causes, incidence and prevention of the common oral diseases. One of the most common etiologies for the development of dental caries, fluorosis, temporomandibular disorders and gingival diseases is malocclusion. 1 Tooth malposition may also lead to difficulty in functional movements of the mandible, difficulty in mastication, swallowing, speech, increased susceptibility to trauma or periodontal problems. 2 Malocclusion means bad bite, and it consists of a spectrum of deviation from the normal or ideal occlusion to severe anomalies. 3,4 Malocclusion is defined as an \"occlusion in which there is a molar relationship between the arches in any of the planes of spaces or in which there are anomalies in tooth position beyond the normal limits.\" Malocclusion usually creates feeling of shame for their facial appearance and may also give feeling of shy in their society. 4 The outcomes of the orthodontic treatment are prevention of tissue damage, improvement in physical function and esthetic. The other major benefits are improving quality of life, development of self-confidence; and physical, psychological and social changes. [1][2][3][4] It is important to educate the individuals about the benefits of the orthodontic treatment. This can be accomplished by a multi-disciplinary approach in which general dental practitioners and other non-orthodontic specialties can play the role of oral orthodontic health educators, but only if they have good knowledge and attitude of principles and practice of orthodontic treatment. Lew 5 has also stated that \"practitioners should focus their attention beyond the orthodontic mechanotherapy to the more subjective aspects of patient discomfort and attitude toward treatment.\" 6 Therefore, there is a need to identify the knowledge levels of dental practitioners with respect to the orthodontic treatment as they play an important role in inculcating healthy lifestyle",
