Subjects and Methods: We performed medical charts review from January 2008 to July 2014, retrospectively. Patients who were suspected central originated vertigo at Frenzel goggles test were included among patients who visited our hospital. To investigate the correlation with nystagmus suspected central originated vertigo and brain MRI abnormal findings, we confirmed whether performing brain MRI or not. Then we exclude that patients not performed brain MRI. Results: The number of patients with perverted nystagmus was 15, upbeating was 1 and down-beating was 14. Among these patients, 5 patients have brain MRI abnormal findings. However, 2 patients with MRI abnormal findings were not associated correctly with perverted nystagmus and only 3 patients with perverted nystagmus were considered central originated vertigo and further evaluation and treatment was performed by the department of neurology. Conclusions: Perverted nystagmus was considered to the abnormalities at brain lesions, especially cerebellum, but neurologic symptoms and further evaluation were needed for exact diagnosis of central originated vertigo.",

Positional down beating nystagmus primarily originates from abnormal lesions of flocculonodular lobes or posterior vermis of the cerebellum [6,7]. Perverted head shaking nystagmus refers to vertical direction of eye movement induced by horizontal head oscillation or sustained horizontal chair rotation [3,8]. Therefore, perverted nystagmus spontaneously or perverted head shaking nystagmus may be useful in investigating subclinical cerebellar dysfunction [9]. Furthermore, these types of nystagmus can be easily observed at the bedside by applying Frenzel goggles [10,11].",

The head was shaken horizontally by an examiner in a sinusoidal manner at a rate of 2.5 Hz with an amplitude of 10 degrees for 10s.
