Subjects and Methods: We performed medical charts review from January 2008 to July 2014, retrospectively. Patients who were suspected central originated vertigo at Frenzel goggles test were included among patients who visited our hospital. To investigate the correlation with nystagmus suspected central originated vertigo and brain MRI abnormal findings, we confirmed whether performing brain MRI or not. Then we exclude that patients not performed brain MRI. Results: The number of patients with perverted nystagmus was 15, upbeating was 1 and down-beating was 14. Among these patients, 5 patients have brain MRI abnormal findings. However, 2 patients with MRI abnormal findings were not associated correctly with perverted nystagmus and only 3 patients with perverted nystagmus were considered central originated vertigo and further evaluation and treatment was performed by the department of neurology. Conclusions: Perverted nystagmus was considered to the abnormalities at brain lesions, especially cerebellum, but neurologic symptoms and further evaluation were needed for exact diagnosis of central originated vertigo."

Positional down beating nystagmus primarily originates from abnormal lesions of flocculonodular lobes or posterior vermis of the cerebellum [6,7]. Perverted head shaking nystagmus refers to vertical direction of eye movement induced by horizontal head oscillation or sustained horizontal chair rotation [3,8]. Therefore, perverted nystagmus spontaneously or perverted head shaking nystagmus may be useful in investigating subclinical cerebellar dysfunction [9]. Furthermore, these types of nystagmus can be easily observed at the bedside by applying Frenzel goggles [10,11].",

Positioning nystagmus was induced by the Dix-Hallpike and straight head-hanging maneuvers. At each position, the patients were instructed not to close their eyes. During measuring head shaking nystagmus, patient's eyes closed and their head tilted forward about 30 degrees to bring the horizontal semicircular canals into the plane of stimulation. The head was shaken horizontally by an examiner in a sinusoidal manner at a rate of 2.5 Hz with an amplitude of 10 degrees for 10s. After the head-shaking, the patients were instructed to open their eyes and look straight ahead. Eye movements were recorded with an infrared camera (resolution of 640\u00d7480 pixels, frame rate of 60 Hz) and displayed on a computer monitor (SLMED, Seoul, Korea).

Brain MRI-diffusion is a commonly performed MRI sequence for evaluation of acute ischemic stroke, and is sensitive in detection of small and early infarcts. Brain MRI is also sensitive in detection of infarcts and can more exact assessment about pathologic lesions. MRA generates pictures of the arteries or aneurysms for evaluating abnormal narrowing or vessel wall dilatations. In this study, brain MRI-MRA means that brain MRI was performed with brain MRA, and brain MRI-IAC means the brain MRI focused on posterior fossa area. Seventeen cases performed brain MRI-diffusion, 4 cases performed brain MRI, 15 performed brain MRI-MRA, and 2 performed brain MRI-IAC.

The reason was that her symptoms onset was 1 week ago and we didn't rule out the progression of old infarction. Despite the brain MRI-diffusion reading of No. 13 patient was old lacunar infarction at left cerebellum, we consulted to department of neurology and didn't rule out acute infarction because perverted nystagmus was persisted, dizziness was not improved, and acute lacunar infarction could be seen low signal intensity at brain MRI-diffusion. Unfortunately, No. 13 patient refused further work up and re-admitted at our department of neurology due to left mid brain and both cerebellar infarction with vertebral artery stenosis after 5 months.

Eight patients with isolated cerebellar focal infarction all presented with vertigo sensation and severe imbalance. They accentuated severe imbalance and a negative head impulse test were important factors for distinguishing focal infarction from peripheral  vestibular dysfunction [18]. As above, for accurate diagnose cerebellar focal infarct, further study correlation like bithermal caloric tests, cervical and ocular VEMPs, and brain MRI was needed [15].",

Second, we did not considered time of onset of symptoms and time of diagnosis at brain ischemic stroke strictly. In this reason, we missed the period of appearing perverted nystagmus at patients with cerebellar vascular abnormalities. In order to further study, we needed greater number of patients and more exact classification criteria."
