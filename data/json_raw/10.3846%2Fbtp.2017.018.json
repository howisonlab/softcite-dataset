In order to achieve these aims, it is necessary to identify the management success factors supporting the fundamental competitiveness of logistics enterprises, as this is an essential development step for the companies involved (Wu 2012). The outsourcer does not have perfect information about either the service provider's capacity cost (i.e., cost for providing fast service), or her quality cost (i.e., cost of achieving a high quality level) (Ren et al. 2016). Logistics outsourcing has become an important strategy for companies seeking to gain a competitive advantage (Huo et al. 2015). The way out to stay competitive is by outsourcing the non-core business functions (Sople 2016).",

            "text": "The logistics services industry has demonstrated tremendous growth over several decades, and there has been an increasing academic interest in logistics service providers (LSPs), especially since the 1990s (Maloni and Carter 2006). According to Lukassen and Wallenburg (2010), the work of LSPs has been increasingly recognised over the last few years, as has the significance of functioning supply relationships (Huemer 2012). Third-party logistics (3PL) plays a main role in supply chain management and, as a result, has experienced remarkable growth. The demand for 3PL providers has become a main approach (Govindan et al. 2016). Companies generally outsource their logistics By enhancing operational performance, integration improves outsourcing performance in terms of both financial performance and overall satisfaction. Lastly, operational performance also contributes to financial performance (Yang and Zhao 2016).",

            "text": "Building relationships of trust seems to be a continuously attractive feature for business partners in contemporary society. However, achieving the close level of trust in relationships which business partners hope for is not easy during the business cooperation period. Basically, in reallife business environments the building of trust relationships appears to be impacted by the implementation of every detailed element of business cooperation decision-making during the business development processes (Wang 2012). The fundamental meaning of building trust can be understood in the sense that in-depth business collaboration with business partners is affected by the speed of trust-building, i.e. the time taken to create trust during the processes of developing the business. Therefore, trust is an important element in building long-term relationships (Ganesan 1994) and is considered a critical factor in the success of logistics outsourcing relationships (Tian et al. 2008, Schoenherr et al. 2015. Trust is an essential factor for successful resource sharing in logistics. Trust building is long-term multi-disciplinary agenda in collaborative networked organizations including those in supply chain and logistics (Daudi et al. 2017). They continue that trust is important for the information sharing and collaboration between supply chain partners and it enables development of log-term collaborative strategy (Stonkut\u0117 and Vveinhardt 2016). For supply chains, collective optimization, with sharing and cooperation is key to success. Therefore, trust between Inter-organizational Information System partners is essential. However, firms are wary of sharing information across organizational boundaries (Sing and Teng 2016). For supply chains, collective optimization, with sharing and cooperation is key to success. Therefore, trust between inter-organizational information system partners is essential (Singh and Teng 2016). Our research aim was to examine the role of trust and the effect of the level of trust in the competitiveness of logistics services providers and within this, to examine the in-sector level of trust (involving clients, sub-contractors and other logistics service providers), as well as the essential factors in the development of trust within the firm. The study of trust is important from the perspective of logistics service providers because, given its cost-reducing effect, it represents an important factor in competitiveness and growth. This research contributes to the sparse literature that has examined the relationship between key success factors (inter-organisational and inter-firm firm relationships) and the performance of logistics service providers in a Hungarian context.",

            "text": "There are real problems in separating the two concepts; however, most studies have opted to use individuals' reports to assess inter-organisational trust levels. A few studies have looked at both interpersonal and inter-organisational trust in buyer-supplier relationships (Zaheer et al. 1998). Trust shapes inter-firm relational embeddedness, which is characterised as a range of integration activities reflecting close working practices between buyers and suppliers (Lawson et al. 2008). Based upon a widespread belief on the part of those involved in business, having positive trust relationships potentially supports and promotes further business collaboration between business partners (Blomqvist 1997, Gambetta 2000, Schumacher 2006. Trust refers to the extent to which partners in a relationship perceive each other as credible and benevolent. Credibility reflects the extent to which a firm in a relationship believes that the other party has the required expertise to perform the expected task effectively, while benevolence occurs when one relationship partner believes that the other party has intentions and motives that will benefit the relationship (Nyaga et al. 2010). Sahay (2003) described the trust factors related to collaborating enterprises as follows: the cost and/or profit side of the relationship, the foreseeable good performance and procedure, the role of common values and standards, the fact that the other party is able to meet its commitments, the development of trust, the long-term strategy, the transfer of trust as well as the commitments and competence-based trust can be achieved also if one of the partners are able to meet its commitments. Three aspects of a supply chain network influence network-level trust in supply chains: the number of uninfluenced partners, the number of uninfluential partners and the degree of interdependence (Capaldo and Giannoccaro 2015). Morgan and Hunt (1994) emphasise the importance of meeting commitments, since this is the pre-requisite of trust for partners in the supply chain. In addition, Hurley (2006) confirms that the personality, culture and previous experience of the leading manager of the enterprise has a significant impact, both on the establishment of the work environment and on the development of enterprise relationships and partner behaviours. The existing literature shows extensive support for the overall beneficial effect of trust on business transactions, operational effectiveness and product quality (Shin et al. 2000), and inter-organisational relationships (Szulanski et al. 2004). Wang (2012) pointed out that business partners today no longer only emphasize the importance of trust building, because there is no doubt that the prerequisite of building trust is becoming an inevitable common understanding in business. Hence, business partners prefer to seek a way to build trust relationships, or organizations are even more eager to stimulate trust relationships with their business partners.",

            "text": "Trust is an important coordinating mechanism in interfirm relations, reducing transaction costs and fostering successful collaborations among organizations (Aoyama, Ratick 2007). The importance of trust in organizations is increasingly recognized (Lapointe et al. 2014). Bradach and Eccles (1989) defined trust as \"a type of expectation that alleviates the fear that one's exchange partner will act opportunistically. \" Dore (1983) and Sako (1992) studied the case of interfirm relations in Japan, leading them to identify goodwill as a factor in interfirm relations. Conventionally, research on interfirm relations has largely been conducted on the intra-industry level, typically in manufacturing sectors such as automobiles, textiles, and electronics (Womack et al. 1990, McKendrick et al. 2000, Wong 2002. In contrast, the logistics industry involves both intra-and inter-industry relational dynamics; intra-industry relations are represented by inter-firm relations between logistics providers, and inter-industry relations are represented by those existing between logistics providers and logistics users. Anderson et al. (2017) find that higher initial trust is associated with reduced expenditures for management controls and increased investments in the collaboration. Minnaar et al. (2017) find that trust is interactively related to control in complex and often unpredictable ways rather than in linear ways that result from managerial decision-making. In the network of associations that constitutes the interfirm relationship, trust is not a stable solution that generates predictability, but a quasi-actor that is made to act by the contract and the incorporated control structures. Lusher et al. 's (2012) results confirm that trust induces awareness and produces expectations of reciprocity -features that are consistent with the view of trust as a general organizing principle. Trust in interfirm exchange has traditionally been treated as mutually held and jointly determined by the two parties in a relationship. Yet, the expectations of exchange partners can, and routinely do, differ with respect to the goals, preferences, and vulnerabilities in their shared relationship (McEvily et al. 2017).",

From this list the target group was selected, including enterprises with a revenue (net sales) of at least 100 000 EUR, but not higher than EUR 100 million per year. Our sample represents the opinions of big companies of the sector, because of their relatively low response rate and large share of revenue in the industrial sector. At the same time, as shown above, the geographical distribution of the sample corresponded to the distribution of the population. 13% of the interviewed LSPs were established in 1990, when a number of entrepreneurs decided to set up their own companies due to the political and economic restructuring occurring in the region. More than 50% of the examined LSPs were engaged in the domestic and international road transport of goods or road forwarding services directly after their establishment. 32% of the newly-established LSPs were primarily involved in warehousing activities. The following activities ranged between 10%-20%: railway transport and/or forwarding, air freight and/or forwarding, water freight and/or forwarding, transport and/or forwarding of containers, custom-house agent activities, transport and/or forwarding of oversized goods, logistics activities outsourced by clients inside or outside the factory yard, freight insurance and logistics consultancy.

In total 4% of respondents rated it as 9, i.e. they almost completely trust their partner; this is a very low level. At the same time, 4% rated the level of trust at 2, reflecting mistrust within the industry. If we break down the data relating to trust levels according to the various actors, we do not find a single client company with a value of between 0 and 2, so clients trust the logistic service companies rather than the other operators around them in the market. In addition, 77% (48 + 29) of the logistics service providers involved in the research evaluated their clients between 7 and 10, reflecting a strong level of trust. They have least trust in other logistics service companies, with 14% rating the level of trust at zero, which is a sign of total distrust. In summary, this means that although in many cases they consider each other as competitors rather than partners, in contrast to this, when Hungarian logistic companies were asked how they see other logistics companies, 66% replied that they are both competitors and co-operative partners. This duality, however, explains the level of confidence shown in Fig. 1. Following this, companies had to answer the same question, but this time as regards how they feel they are evaluated by their partners. They evaluated themselves as most trusted by their clients (48%), while they feel that subcontractors (16%) and other logistics companies (18%) do not trust them at all (Fig. 2).",

We established that in relation to client-logistic service provider relationships, the attempt to work as partners and think together is accompanied by more communication and closer cooperation, which results in more win-win situations. The quantity of communication, good performance, the capacity to meet expectations and be at the customer's disposal, and fulfilment of payment obligations all increase the level of trust in a partner. When creating a high level of trust partners acquire a comprehensive level of knowledge about each other's activities and processes. This \"specific knowledge\" (deep knowledge of each other) and the timely provision of information results in a high level of flexibility in the relationship. As a suggestion, in relation to the search for the appropriate size of the firm, by measuring the level of trust within the firm (related to staff) and maintaining its level (or increasing it further), the leading management of the firm can, by ensuring effective, continuous development and growth, increase the economic size of service firms.",
