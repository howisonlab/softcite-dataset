            "text": "To accomplish the worldwide demand for recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) as a therapeutic, application of cost-efficient expression system of methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) rather than mammalian cells is indispensable. Herein, a report on high levels secreted-expression of Pichia-derived rHuEpo by batch fermentation in a pH stabilized format is presented. The full length cDNA of rHuEpo was inserted into pPICZ\u03b1A vector under control of AOX1 promoter, downstream of the secretion-\u03b1-factor and electroporated into P. pastoris strain X33. The highest expression transformant was selected by screening among the colonies surviving high concentration of Zeocin (1.0 mg/ml), followed by comparative small scale expression analysis by ELISA. Stabilization of pH around 6.0 by adding phosphoric acid into the culture media during induction period, improved the yield of expression to 150 mg/l of the media. Single-step Nickel-affinity chromatography was employed for purification of rHuEpo-6xHis to 80% purity. Analyses by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and N-terminal protein sequencing confirmed the authenticity of the 33 kDa expressed rHuEpo with a native N-terminal indicating the proper cleavage of secretion-signal. Results of this study, further confirmed the possibility of employing methylotrophic yeast for scaled up production aims of rHuEpo as a cost-efficient expression system when provided evidence for higher expression yields through application of pHcontrolled systems."

To reach the highest possible expression levels for our gene of interest (Epo), we primarily tried to select transformants that potentially may contain multiple copies of the integrated vector. For this purpose, transformants that appeared after 3-5 days on plates containing 100 \u00b5g/ml Zeocin were further transferred on plates containing 1 mg/ml Zeocin. Colonies that survive on such a high concentration of Zeocin, potentially may contain multi copies of the cassette inserted into their genome (19) . Moreover, the highest expression clone for scale-up experiment was screened from 20 randomly selected Mut + -Zeocin resistant transformants (1 mg/ml) by culturing them in small scale (10 ml) for comparatively appraising the level of expression among them. It should be noted, however that multiple cassette insertions into the genome of selected transformants should be verified by methods like Southern blotting.",

Incidence of these protein bands may be explained by occurrence of the uncleaved pro-\u03b1-factor/ Epo which were secreted into the culture media as fusion proteins. In this context, the variation in mobility between the bands in 42 -45 kDa regions may reflect differential trimming of core oligosaccharides on the pro region segment; as this region contains three sites for Aspargine-linked glycosylation and complete or partial glycosylation of these sites may result to slightly different MWs (29) . The phenomenon of secretion of proteins in fusion with pro-\u03b1-factor into the media has been already reported and is the reflection of insufficient Kex2 endoprotease processing to remove the \u03b1-factor secretory signal from protein (9,30) .",

Data evidenced in this report demonstrated that P. pastoris has the potential for production of low-cost Epo and merits further scaled-up studies in more sophisticated and controlled production bioreactors."
