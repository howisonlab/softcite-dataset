            "text": "Siblings of individuals with autism have over 20 times the population risk of autism. Evidence of comparable, but less marked, cognitive and social communication deficits in siblings suggests a role for these traits in the search for biomarkers of familial risk. However, no neuroimaging biomarkers of familial risk have been identified to date. Here we show, for the first time, that the neural response to facial expression of emotion differs between unaffected siblings and healthy controls with no family history of autism. Strikingly, the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to happy versus neutral faces was significantly reduced in unaffected siblings compared with controls within a number of brain areas implicated in empathy and face processing. The response in unaffected siblings did not differ significantly from the response in autism. Furthermore, investigation of the response to faces versus fixation crosses suggested that, within the context of this study, an atypical response specifically to happy faces, rather than to faces in general, accounts for the observed sibling versus controls difference and is a clear biomarker of familial risk. Our findings suggest that an atypical implicit response to facial expression of emotion may form the basis of impaired emotional reactivity in autism and in the broader autism phenotype in relatives. These results demonstrate that the fMRI response to facial expression of emotion is a candidate neuroimaging endophenotype for autism, and may offer far-reaching insights into the etiology of autism.",

            "text": "Siblings of individuals with autism have a greatly enhanced risk of developing autism-estimated to be in excess of a 20fold increase compared with the general population. [1][2][3] Furthermore, it is increasingly understood that many apparently unaffected siblings (and their parents, as another example of first-degree relatives) display subtle impairments in the cognitive domains characteristically affected by autism. [4][5][6][7] Siblings of individuals with autism have however been the subject of relatively little neuroimaging research. [8][9][10] The concept of an endophenotype-a marker of familial risk for a condition-has in recent years become the focus of considerable attention in neuropsychiatric research. Although the term was first used in the 1960s in the field of insect biology, 11 within a few years it was applied within psychiatry. 12 An endophenotype is a heritable feature associated with a condition, present in affected individuals regardless of whether their condition is manifested, which co-segregates with the condition in families and which is present in unaffected family members at a higher rate than in the general population. 13 In such family members, endophenotypes represent instances in which genes associated with a particular condition exert measurable effects in individuals in whom they are insufficient to cause the condition itself to become manifest. The promise of characterizing endophenotypes lies in their hypothesized intermediate position between genotype and phenotype. Syndromes such as autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are complex constellations of clinical signs and symptoms. Considerable phenotypic heterogeneity exists within clinical populations and it is likely that the etiologies of these conditions contain heterogeneity too. In the case of autism, it has been recognized that a unitary cause is unlikely. 14 Attempts to characterize the genetics of these conditions therefore will ultimately be hampered by a reliance on traditional classificatory systems that coalesce this heterogeneity into a unitary diagnosis. As a smaller and simpler phenotypic unit than the condition itself, the etiology of the endophenotype is likely to be correspondingly simpler: it can be said to be 'closer to the level of gene action'. 15 Difficulties in empathy and in the understanding of social stimuli and situations form a central aspect of the autistic phenotype. 16 The neurophysiological response to faces, and in particular facial emotional expressions, is atypical in autism. This has been documented using electroencephalography, 17 magnetoencephalography, 18 positron emission tomography 19 and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 20 studies. A considerable body of evidence reveals atypical fMRI response to faces and other social stimuli within a network of brain structures that has been termed the 'social brain'. 21,22 This comprises the amygdala and its interconnections with the superior temporal sulcus (STS), orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and fusiform face area (FFA), among other regions. The STS is of particular importance not only in being activated during a range of mentalizing tasks in controls 23 but also as a site within which brain structure and function correlate with autistic traits in the general population. 24 Similarly, the FFA located within the fusiform gyrus of the occipitotemporal cortex is particularly activated by facial stimuli in controls 25 and is greatly reduced in activation in people with autism. 20 Given reports of social deficits in relatives of those with autism, 26 the neural response to emotional expressions in faces seems a promising area within which to investigate possible endophenotypes of autism.",

Participants completed a task of implicit facial emotion processing comprising eight blocks of happy faces, eight blocks of fearful faces, eight blocks of neutral faces and eight blocks of fixation crosses. Facial stimuli were from an established battery of emotional faces, 31 and comprised eight different facial identities expressing happy, fearful and neutral expressions (that is, 24 faces in total). Stimuli were presented in a blocked design in one of two pseudorandom orders (which were counterbalanced across all participants in each study group) and were presented in e-Prime version 2.0 Professional (Psychological Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Each block lasted 20 s and comprised four stimuli presented for 4 s each with an interstimulus interval of 1 s. Blocks were separated by a 2 s interblock interval. During task conditions (happy, fearful and neutral faces) participants were required to press one of two buttons to indicate the gender of the face using a button box held in the right hand. During fixation blocks, the participants were required to stare passively at a fixation cross. As with the facial blocks, four fixation cross stimuli were presented for 4 s each with an interstimulus interval of 1 s.",

Moreover, in siblings with no autism spectrum diagnosis and no manifest severe behavioral features of autism, we have demonstrated significant differences from controls in terms of the fMRI response to happy versus neutral faces within a range of other brain areas, particularly regions related to the STS and temporal poles. Importantly, the emotion and control conditions differed only in terms of facial expression-with all other aspects of these conditions, such as those related to the sex discrimination task, being identical. This suggests that it is specifically the implicit response to facial expression of emotion rather than some other aspect of the task that is associated with the significant sibling versus control differences observed.",

On the basis of the set of emotions tested here (happiness and fear), the finding of an atypical neural response within these brain areas in autism and sibling groups specifically to happy faces may reflect the possibility that an implicit response to happy faces is driven by empathy-impairments of which have a central role within the phenotype of autism-whereas the response to fearful stimuli (found in this study to be intact in siblings but not individuals with autism) is likely driven by their role as indicators of threat. Observed facial fear and anger may be of sufficient evolutionary importance as danger cues that, unlike facial happiness, they elicit an intact response in the broader phenotype of autism. This is consistent with reports 39 of an intact 'anger superiority effect' in autism, where angry faces are salient and easier to spot within a collection of faces than happy faces.",

We propose that the fMRI response to happy versus neutral faces within these brain areas is an endophenotype of autism. As a biomarker of familial risk for autism, this candidate endophenotype has the advantage of being a quantitative measure, with greater statistical power than categorical measures. These findings offer an attractive strategy to future genetic research, investigating the genetic correlates of this candidate endophenotype.",
