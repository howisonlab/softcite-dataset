            "text": "Tissue repair is an essential homeostatic response that entails the orchestration of a wealth of cellular and molecular events involving resident and inflammatory cell types (Martin, 1997). Similarities have been noted between healing wounds and tumors (Dvorak, 1986), and key genes expressed during wound healing and in cancer share transcriptional regulatory mechanisms (Dauer et al., 2005). Moreover, wounding hastens skin carcinogenesis in transgenic mouse models (DePianto et al., 2010;Kasper et al., 2011;Wong and Reiter, 2011). Defining the mechanisms regulating the amplitude and duration of normal tissue repair events may shed light on what goes awry in tumors, in chronic nonhealing wounds, and related disease settings (Djalilian et al., 2006).",

Skin grafting showed that K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes, which also exhibit reduced K16 levels owing to enhanced turnover (Bernot et al., 2005), are mechanically compromised and readily rupture while attempting to migrate into the setting of acute skin wounds in situ (Wong and Coulombe, 2003). In skin explant culture, a setting in which frictional forces are lesser but otherwise very relevant to wound epithelialization in situ (Mazzalupo et al., 2002), K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes maintain their integrity and actually migrate markedly faster than wild type (WT; Wong and Coulombe, 2003). Of note, changes in the expression and/or regulation of intermediate filament (IF) proteins is a common occurrence after injury to various tissues including muscle and central nervous system, and, otherwise, IF proteins have been shown to impact the migration of several types of cells (Coulombe and Wong, 2004).",

The type II keratins 6a and 6b (K6a and K6b) are among the genes induced early on in wound-proximal keratinocytes and maintained during reepithelialization. Paradoxically, genetic ablation of K6a and K6b results in enhanced keratinocyte migration. In this paper, we show that this trait results from activation of Src kinase and key Src substrates that promote cell migration.

K6 protein was enriched in the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM), a key site of Src inhibition, and DRMs from K6-null keratinocytes were depleted of both keratin and Src.

In contrast, SFK activity level was normal in lysates prepared from K14 \ue032/\ue032 or K17 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes (Figs. 1 B and S1 E), which show WT-like migration (not depicted). Key Src substrates with defined roles in cell migration (e.g., FAK, P130Cas, and paxillin) showed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation on Src-regulated sites in K6 \ue032/\ue032 but not in K14 \ue032/\ue032 or K17 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes (Fig. 1 B). By immunostaining, activated Src/SFK epitopes concentrate at the leading edge of K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes compared with WT (Fig. 1 C; quantified in Fig. S1 F), a pattern known to favor epithelial cell migration during corneal wound closure (Gao et al., 2004). Migration of WT and K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes was markedly inhibited by treatment of skin explants with the Src inhibitor PP2 (Hanke et al., 1996), suggesting a requirement for Src activity in this setting (Fig. S1 G). Western blot analysis of protein extracts from wound edge tissue in WT mouse skin showed that Src activation, as well as FAK and Crk-associated substrate (CAS) phosphorylation, is robustly enhanced relative to intact skin tissue away from the wound (Fig. S2 A). K6 and K17 are induced at the total protein level, whereas K5 levels remained fairly constant, in this setting (Fig. S2, A and B; Paladini et al., 1996; (Wong and Coulombe, 2003), including a protein of 60-kD M r , the correct size for Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase with an established role in cell migration (Altun-Gultekin and Wagner, 1996;Hall et al., 1996). Src is activated in wound settings as well as in psoriatic and neoplastic skin (Ayli et al., 2008). Here, we explore the novel hypothesis that K6 normally functions to dampen Src signaling in wound-activated keratinocytes and that the loss of K6 leads to unimpeded Src activation and enhanced keratinocyte migration.",

Therefore, this phenotype is very robust and represents an intrinsic property of K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes. The intracellular organization of keratin filaments appears normal in the absence of K6 (Fig. S1 B). The 4G10 antibody used in our previous study (Wong and Coulombe, 2003) reacts with in vitro activated Src and immunoprecipitates Src and FAK from mouse skin keratinocytes (in a complex and/or individually; see Fig. S1,C and D).

Data (mean \u00b1 SEM) are fold change relative to WT. *, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01. n = 3 independent sample pairs. Bar, 20 \u00b5m. (B) Western blot analysis of Src/SFK activity in K6 \ue032/\ue032 , K14 \ue032/\ue032 , and K17 \ue032/\ue032 skin explant keratinocyte protein lysates. Loading was assessed via actin (digitonin-soluble fractions) or caveolin (triton-soluble fractions). Blots were performed at least three times from independent lysates. Migration of standards is given in kilodaltons. (C) Subcellular localization of activated Src/SFKs in WT or K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes in primary culture. Bar, 25 \u00b5m. (insets) Higher magnifications of the boxed areas on the left to detail the leading edge. Bar, 7 \u00b5m. (D) Dual immunostaining for p-Y410 CAS and vinculin in WT or K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes in primary culture (fibronectin-coated coverslips). Arrows depict examples of colocalization. Arrowheads point to the bordering phenotype at the leading edge of K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes. Bar, 15 \u00b5m.",

This interaction was dependent on K6, as conveyed by parallel coimmunoprecipitation assays from K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes (Fig. 2 A). In vitro, purified His-tagged human Src protein (full-length [FL] Src protein) efficiently cosedimented with assembled K6/K17 filaments reconstituted from pure human recombinant proteins (Fig. 2, B and C). Such cosedimentation reflects genuine keratin binding, as the C-terminal catalytic domain (CD) of Src (Src CD; Fig. 3 A) pellets poorly in this assay (Fig. 2, B and C). In vitro activated Src also readily cosedimented with K6/K17 filaments (Fig. 2 B). Far-Western assays revealed that purified Src preferentially binds type II keratins (K5 and K6) and the type III IF vimentin, relative to type I keratins (Fig. 2 D). This trend is enhanced when using preactivated Src as the ligand, as binding to K6 and vimentin remains strong compared with K5 or type I keratins (Fig. 2 D).",

            "text": "Cell migration is a highly spatially organized process (Martin, 1997), raising the prospect that the keratin-Src interaction may be segregated to a specialized subcellular compartment at or near the membrane. We focused on detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) as a location of interest as a result of its established role as a key site of Src regulation (Oneyama et al., 2008). Upon activation, Src is recruited to cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (which are resistant to Triton X-100 extraction), where it phosphorylates C-terminal Src kinase (CSK)-binding protein (CBP; Kawabuchi et al., 2000). CSK is then recruited and inactivates Src via phosphorylation of its C-terminal tail (Oneyama et al., 2008). Keratin (Caruso and Stemmer, 2011) and vimentin (Berg et al., 2009) IF proteins have been found in DRMs. Likewise, we identified a fraction of the keratin pool, including K5, K6 (Fig. 4, A and B), K14, and K17 (not depicted) as well as Src itself (Fig. 4 C), in DRM fractions from WT skin explant lysates. In contrast, lysates from K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes showed reduced levels of keratin and Src in DRMs (Fig. 4, A-C). Two phosphorylated forms of Src also localized to DRM fractions in both WT and K6 \ue032/\ue032 explant lysate (Fig. 4 D). Consistent with Confocal microscopy was used to relate the distribution of endogenous Src and transfected GFP-tagged keratin in nonmigrating WT keratinocytes in conventional primary culture. Both proteins showed a broad, pan-cytoplasmic distribution and partially colocalized (Fig. 2 E). Coimmunoprecipitation of Src and keratin from WT skin wounds in situ proved difficult as a result of the relatively small amount of activated K6/K17expressing keratinocytes compared with other cell types (e.g., inflammatory cells and dermal fibroblasts), cellular debris, and the protein-rich scab. As an alternative, we used TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) treatment of mouse ear to induce both K6 expression and Src activation in epidermis (Fig. 2 F;Xian et al., 1997). Keratins coimmunoprecipitated with Src in this context (Fig. 2 G). These data establish that Src directly binds keratins and that K6, in particular, shows a consistently higher affinity for Src kinase whether it is active or not.",

            "text": "Next, we set out to map the determinants mediating Src binding to keratins. Src comprises three major domains: SH3, SH2, and the CD (Fig. 3 A;  Xu et al., 1997). Src's CD interacts poorly with keratin filaments (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, a His-GFP-Src N-terminal fusion comprising the SH3 and SH2 domains ( Fig. 3 A) showed full binding to keratin IFs in cosedimentation assays (Fig. 3 B). Upon further dissection, the SH2 domain (residues 149-254) mediated strong binding to keratin IFs in copelleting assays (Fig. 3 B) and exhibited a higher affinity for type II keratins in Far-Western blots (Fig. 3 C). The SH3 domain did not bind keratin in either assay (Fig. 3, B and C). Direct binding to Src's SH2 domain does not involve phosphorylated tyrosine residues on keratins, given their recombinant bacterial source, implying that it is mediated by a novel binding determinant. A motif homologous to type I keratins has been recognized in this specific region of Src (Tachibana In vitro cosedimentation of His-GFP-Src N-terminal, His-GFP-SH2, and His-GFP-SH3 fusions with K6/K17 filaments, detected using GFP antibody. P, pellet; S, supernatant. (C) Far-Western overlays using His-GFP-SH2 or His-GFP-SH3 as ligands, detected with GFP antibody. Ponceau staining shows loading for proteins tested. Vim, vimentin. (D) FL Src or Src CD was equilibrated with or without K6/K17 filaments before activation via ATP-dependent autophosphorylation (p-Y416 Src/SFK). Total Src (or CD) levels are shown for comparison. (E) Quantification of Src FL or Src CD sequestration by K6/K17 filaments. Values (mean \u00b1 SEM; ImageJ) are reported as activity ratio and calculated by relating band intensity for active Src/Src CD in the presence of K6/K17 to active Src/Src CD band intensity in the absence of K6/K17. *, P < 0.01. In all instances, similar results were achieved from at least three independent experiments. Migration of mass standards is given in kilodaltons. Todorovi\u0107 et al., 2010). Plakoglobin, in particular, is a known Src target (Miravet et al., 2003) and reacts with the monoclonal antibody 4G10 (unpublished data). The molecular mass of plakoglobin (\ue07a80 kD) corresponds to a tyrosinephosphorylated epitope that is elevated in lysates from migrating K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes (Wong and Coulombe, 2003). Others have recently shown that plakoglobin and other desmosomal proteins are enriched in DRM fractions (Delva et al., 2008;Brennan et al., 2011), as we observed in WT and K6 \ue032/\ue032 mouse keratinocytes (unpublished data). These findings raise the distinct possibility of plakoglobin's contribution, perhaps in conjunction with other keratin-binding proteins (e.g., plectin) to the recruitment of keratin proteins to lipid rafts and/or to regulation of Src in migrating keratinocytes.",

            "text": "Cells likely possess mechanisms guarding them against the negative consequences of excessive Src activity, which, in settings such as tissue repair, is promoted by numerous growth factors, activated integrins, and other stimuli (Martin, 1997). High Src activity is a powerful inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (Behrens et al., 1993) and also is a recurring characteristic of human cancers (Bild et al., 2006). K6 is also commonly induced in carcinomas affecting skin and related complex epithelia (Moll et al., 1983); intriguingly, loss of K6 expression correlates with a more aggressive behavior in endometrial cancers (Stefansson et al., 2006) and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (Larcher et al., 1992). Although the role of K6 in tumor settings has not been defined, we speculate that our model, there was no difference in the amount of pY527 (inhibited) SFK epitopes in DRM fractions from WT and K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes, whereas there was a clear reduction in p-Y416 (activated) epitopes in K6 \ue032/\ue032 relative to WT (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, FAK, phospho-FAK, phospho-CAS, and phospho-paxillin do not occur in DRM fractions in either genotype (unpublished data). Such findings argue that the localization of Src to DRMs may be distinct from its recruitment to focal adhesions.",

The canonical view of Src regulation involves an on/off switch, with inactivation taking place within DRMs (Fig. 4 E;  Cooper et al., 1986;Oneyama et al., 2008;Guarino, 2010). Based on the findings reported here, we propose that a direct interaction between Src and K6 and perhaps other proteins results in a prolonged sequestration of Src in DRMs of wound-activated WT skin keratinocytes, thus delaying its reactivation and dampening its overall activity at the leading edge (Fig. 4 E).",

Furthermore, ablation of plectin or plakoglobin robustly activates SFKs (Goto et al., 2006; Osmanagic-Myers Figure 4. Keratins and Src are enriched in DRM fractions in a K6-dependent fashion. (A) DRMs obtained from WT and K6 \ue032/\ue032 keratinocytes in explant cultures. Ganglioside GM1 was used as a marker for DRMs (fraction [FR] no. 5-7; asterisks in A-D). (B) DRM preparations from WT and K6 \ue032/\ue032 samples (see A) were assayed for K5, K6, and caveolin (Cav), a lipid raft marker, via Western blot. (C) Total Src levels in DRMs from WT and K6 \ue032/\ue032 samples (see A). Input is 1% of the lysate used to prepare DRM. (D) p-Y416 SFK (active) and p-Y527 SFK (inactive) in DRMs from WT and K6 \ue032/\ue032 samples (see A). Input is 1% of the lysate. All DRM experiments have been repeated three times with similar results. Migration of mass standards is given in kilodaltons. (E) Schematic depiction of the mechanism of Src regulation in woundactivated keratinocytes without (left) and with (right) a keratin-dependent step. Canonically, Src is regulated by an on/off switch, with activation (asterisks) by exposure to growth factors (GF) and/or activated integrins followed by translocation to DRMs and inhibition via interaction with CSK and CBP. Src reactivation requires translocation out of DRMs (Guarino, 2010). We propose that a keratin-binding step within DRMs delays Src exit from rafts, thereby moderating the pool of Src available for reactivation by relevant stimuli. Note that the sequence with which Src interacts with CBP, CSK, and K6 (and other entities in DRMs) is unknown.",

Cells were incubated in the presence of 0.01% digitonin and spun down, and pellets were resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer. Quantitative outgrowth assays were performed under the same conditions using 2-mm punch biopsies, except that on day 3, explants were treated with mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h to irreversibly inhibit DNA replication and mitosis (Wong and Coulombe, 2003;Bernot et al., 2004) and then with (or without) PP2 (Life Technologies) at various concentrations. PP2 treatments continued from day 3 to day 6, at which point both punch and outgrowth were fixed and stained with Giemsa dye (Sigma-Aldrich). Stained outgrowths were scanned, and the outgrowth area was measured using the ImageJ freeware (National Institutes of Health), as previously described (Wong and Coulombe, 2003;Bernot et al., 2004), by subtracting the area of the punch (square pixels) from the total area of punch and outgrowth (square pixels). Student's t test was applied to determine probability values.",

Values reported are a ratio of mean pixel intensity at the leading edge per area of leading edge. In cosedimentation assays in vitro involving reconstituted keratin filaments, the fraction of bound proteins (Src FL or Src CD) was quantified using ImageJ in a similar manner, except that signal intensity of pelleted Src was divided by total Src signal intensity (total found in supernatant and pellet fractions). Similarly, Src's activity status in this in vitro setting was quantitated in the same fashion, except that an activity ratio was obtained by relating the intensity of the phospho-Src signal in presence and absence of keratin filaments."
