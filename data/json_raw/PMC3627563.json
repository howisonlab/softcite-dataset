            "text": "With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the rapid generation and accumulation of large amounts of sequencing data pose an insurmountable demand for efficient algorithms for constructing whole-genome phylogenies. The existing phylogenomic methods all use assembled sequences, which are often not available owing to the difficulty of assembling short-reads; this obstructs phylogenetic investigations on species without a reference genome. In this report, we present co-phylog, an assembly-free phylogenomic approach that creates a 'micro-alignment' at each 'object' in the sequence using the 'context' of the object and calculates pairwise distances before reconstructing the phylogenetic tree based on those distances. We explored the parameters' usages and the optimal working range of co-phylog, assessed co-phylog using the simulated next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and the real NGS raw data. We also compared co-phylog method with traditional alignment and alignment-free methods and illustrated the advantages and limitations of co-phylog method. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cophylog is efficient algorithm and that it delivers high resolution and accurate phylogenies using wholegenome unassembled sequencing data, especially in the case of closely related organisms, thereby significantly alleviating the computational burden in the genomic era.",

            "text": "Recent advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies enabled the completion of sequencing effort in >1000 species, most of which are prokaryotes. This achievement has brought new opportunities to many research areas in biological sciences, especially in reconstructing the phylogeny of those species. Traditional methods in phylogenetic analysis are based on alignment of genes or segments. For prokaryotes, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (or 16S rDNA) is the sequence of choice for phylogenetic analysis given that it exists in almost all prokaryotic organisms, and it rarely undergoes horizontal gene transfer. However, 16S rDNA is highly conserved, so that it provides a limited resolution for closely related species. This problem could be possibly circumvented by selecting less conserved genes, but individual genes may reveal inconsistent and sometimes biased phylogenies.",

            "text": "Given the genomic data that are now available for many organisms, several studies have turned to whole-genome data to construct phylogenies, and these phylogenomic trees typically have much higher resolution than those based on a single gene. The methods developed for phylogenomic analysis thus far can be classified into alignment-based methods (1)(2)(3) and alignment-free methods (4,5). Alignment-based methods are two-phase procedures that first create multiple sequence alignment (MSA) among the input sequences and then reconstruct the phylogenetic tree based on these MSA. In evolutionary biology, MSA has long believed to be a necessary prerequisite for making accurate inferences regarding phylogeny, but this viewpoint has recently been increasingly questioned (6)(7)(8). MSA is a combinatorial optimization problem that is known to be NP-hard (9,10). If these methods were applied to genomic data from highthroughput sequencing, the analysis would be unaffordable computationally.",

They calculate the distances between pairwise organisms using oligopeptide word usage frequencies (5,11) or information measurements, such as Kolmogorov complexity (12,13) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (14). The recently proposed average common substring approach is based on Kullback-Leibler relative entropy (4), and the distance in this approach reflects the average length of the maximum common substring of the paired sequences. Composition vector tree (CVtree) (5), singular value decomposition (11) and recent feature frequency profiles (FFPs) methods (15) are similar approaches, and all of the approaches are based on 'word frequencies'. However, these alignmentfree phylogenomic methods have their own problems. For example, distances measured using information theory or word usage frequencies do not typically have a clear biological definition and they are rarely linear with evolutionary time.",

Ma, Tromp and Li proposed using a 0-1 string to describe a seed model where a 1-site represents required match, and 0-site is 'don't care'. For example, if a seed 1110111 is used, then 'actgact' versus 'acttact' and 'actgact' versus 'actgact' are seed matches (19).

For convenience, we generated five perfect NGS datasets that only varied in sequencing depth (depth = 2\u00c2, 6\u00c2, 16\u00c2, 30\u00c2 and 50\u00c2) using an in-house Perl script and the Brucella 13 genomes as the 'sequencing sample genomes'.

All of the reads simulated in the perfect NGS datasets were 75 bp, error-free and uniformly distributed, which allowed us exclude any variation introduced by the sequencing experiment itself. The corresponding co-phylog (with S = C 15,15 O 1 ) tree was constructed using each of the five perfect NGS datasets as input, and the benchmark tree was constructed using the 'sequencing sample genomes' as input.

The branch lengths are proportional to the benchmark tree but shorter (Figure 3a and b). This result occurs because the branch lengths in the co-phylog tree represent the average substitution rates of those sites with unchanged flanking sequences (namely, 'context') between two compared genomes, these sites are generally more conserved than the whole-genome average. The most significant difference between CVtree and the other methods is that the genus Shigella violates the monophyleticity of the genus Escherichia but not the monophyleticity of the E. coli strains (symmetry difference = 20). Similar results were also achieved with the FFPs method (15). Note that the CVtree and FFPs distances represent the extent of the difference in the 'word frequencies' features of two compared genomes, while co-distance and the alignment-based distance estimate average nucleotide (or amino acid) substitution rate, which is more constant across evolutionary history (see 'Discussion' section). One possible explanation is that the CVtree and FFPs trees represent the taxonomy based on genomic features, whereas the co-phylog and alignment-based trees represent the phylogenetic relationship. Another alignment-free method, Kr, was developed to efficiently estimate the pairwise distances between genomes and is 'more accurate than model-free approaches including the average common substring' (22). However, according to this test, the Kr tree was still much less accurate than the co-phylog tree as measured by both topology and branch length (Figure 3a), demonstrating the accuracy of co-phylog in establishing the phylogeny of closely related organisms. The only inconsistencies between the co-phylog tree and the benchmark tree were observed on the E. coli CFT073/E. coli 536/E. coli ED1a branch.",

            "text": "The in silico evolution experiment showed that the co-distance varied significantly starting at the 90th run, which corresponds to a divergence of 0.90 substitutions per site between the two evolved genomes ( Figure 5). The major genomic variation introduced in the 90th evolution was a gLGT event that copied 10 genes from one genome to another; the same gLGT event also occurred at the 80th, 74th, 65th and several other previous runs. However, those occurrences did not significantly affect the computed co-distance. The reason is obvious; the sequences 'copied' to the genome by the recent gLGT are nearly identical with the original ones on another genome, which causes the co-distance between the two genomes to be underestimated. When two genomes are closely related, there are many common contexts between them; the new common contexts that occurred due to the 10 genes gLGT only affected the co-distance weakly, but two distant genomes have few common contexts (e.g. <5000), and the new common contexts that occurred owing to a 10 genes gLGT ($10 000 common contexts) would make up the majority of the common contexts, thus significantly biasing the computed co-distance. This experiment indicates that when the common context count >150 000 (corresponding to a co-distance <0.12 or a real divergence of <0.8 substitution per site if S = C 9,9 O 1 ), the two genomes being compared are close enough to guarantee the stability of the computed co-distance. If using S = C 12,12 O 1 , then 'close enough' genomes should satisfy the criteria of the divergence being <0.58 substitution per site and have a co-distance <0.09, indicating that using long contexts loses more distant homologies. Therefore, when the criteria given in Supplementary Equation (S2) (see Supplementary Data) are satisfied, it is better to choose shorter contexts when applying co-phylog to more distant genomes. This estimation may be different when taking into account more frequent, recent gLGTs. Fortunately, relevant research has suggested that recent gLGTs in two distant genomes are rare (about 7 genes) (28), making the conclusions from our 10-gene gLGT simulation more reliable.",

The co-phylog tree (using S = C 12,12 O 1 , according to Supplementary Equation (S2) and F = 10) constructed on the NGS dataset from the five large diploid organisms matched well with the known taxonomy ( Supplementary Figure S3), illustrating that the tool co-phylog can handle large size analyses and the complication of diploidy.",

Recall that for computing the co-distance between two genomes G 1 and G 2 , each member c i in the intersection R of the two context sets, C S (G 1 ) and C S (G 2 ), is a context match that corresponds to the seed match in a spaced seed alignment. Unlike traditional alignment, the context-object model does not extend inter-seeds but instead extends intra-seeds (namely, the O-parts of the structure). Because the O-parts are short (typically 1 or a few base pairs), it is reasonable to ignore indels during extension. Extension is therefore directly comparing O-grams, and the context-object model is an alignment process with a span of only $20$30 bp, a so-called 'micro-alignment'. There are two main features that make micro-alignment much more efficient than traditional alignment. First, a context match is created only once between the two compared genomes, while a normal 'seed match', which is shorter, is created many times in different regions, which slows down the calculation (19). Second, once a context match is created, as we have elaborated, extensions can be implemented by comparing two O-grams directly. As an O-gram can be stored in a 'word', an extension requires only one operation. In traditional alignment method, the seed match is extended through a dynamic programming process that requires polynomial operations.",

The similar calculation formulas of co-distance (Equation (1)) and the d F (X, Y) implies they have similar computing efficiency. However, their biological meanings are essentially different. As we have previously elaborated, the context-object model is a micro-alignment process, which allows co-phylog to only call the nucleotide substitution events out of the entire range of genome variation. Therefore the co-distance computed, according to Equation (1), estimated the whole-genome average nucleotide (or amino acid) substitution rate of those sites with unchanged flanking sequences (namely, 'context') between the two genomes compared. The calling of substitution events is critical for accurately constructing phylogenetic trees because the nucleotide (or amino acid) substitution rate is relatively constant across evolutionary history according to the molecular clock hypothesis. In contrast, the normalized common k-tuples F(X,Y) could be affected by a wide range of genome variation events to different extents.
