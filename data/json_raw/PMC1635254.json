To improve previous methods we used bioinformatic analysis to predict an optimized combination of methylation-sensitive enzymes that had the highest utility for CpG-island probes and different methods to produce unmethylated representations of test DNA for more sensitive detection of differential methylation by hybridization. Subtraction or methylation-dependent digestion with McrBC was used with optimized (MMASS-v2) or previously described (MMASS-v1, MMASS-sub) methylationsensitive enzyme combinations and compared with a published McrBC method. Comparison was performed using DNA from the cell line HCT116. We show that the distribution of methylation microarray data is inherently skewed and requires exogenous spiked controls for normalization and that analysis of digestion of methylated and unmethylated control sequences together with linear fit models of replicate data showed superior statistical power for the MMASS-v2 method. Comparison with previous methylation data for HCT116 and validation of CpG islands from PXMP4, SFRP2, DCC, RARB and TSEN2 confirmed the accuracy of MMASS-v2 results. The MMASS-v2 method offers improved sensitivity and statistical power for high-throughput microarray identification of differential methylation.",

The vast majority of mammalian DNA methylation is located at the cytosine of CpG dinucleotides which are particularly frequent within CpG islands. The definition of a CpG island continues to evolve but the following criteria are currently accepted (1): a length >500 bp, G + C content >50% and CpG dinucleotides at an observedto-expected ratio >0.60. Approximately 70% of mammalian genomic CpG dinucleotides are methylated and commonly occur within repetitive elements (2). In contrast, most unmethylated CpG islands span the promoter regions of house-keeping genes and tumour suppressor genes and are critical in gene expression regulation and cell differentiation (3).",

            "text": "Differential methylation hybridization (DMH) is an arraybased method for comparing the methylation status of CpG islands between test samples and a common reference (12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). The two DNAs are first digested with MseI to reduce the size of genomic fragments followed by a combination of methylation-sensitive enzymes that only restrict unmethylated recognition sequences. The MseI recognition sequence (TTAA) is found frequently within bulk DNA, but is rarely found within CpG islands which remain intact after digestion (18). Subsequent linker-mediated PCR results in amplicons that are enriched for methylated sequences. The labelled amplicons are competitively hybridized and the ratio of test to reference signal intensities at each probe on the array reflects methylation differences between the two samples. Nouzova et al. (19) modified this method by using digestion with a methylation-dependent enzyme, the homing endonuclease McrBC. This enzyme has a degenerate methylation recognition sequence that only cleaves methylated DNA and is very frequent in CpG islands. Amplicons from digested DNA therefore represent unmethylated sequences, and competitive hybridization of amplicons from McrBC digested and undigested DNA from the same sample was used to identify methylated sequences by within-sample comparison. This avoided the need for a common reference design which is advantageous for profiling clinical samples where no appropriate reference tissue may be available or where the available reference sample may not have a 'normal' methylation pattern. However, a potential disadvantage of the Nouzova et al. (19) method is that there is unequal representation of methylated and unmethylated sequences in a single hybridization and this may reduce sensitivity to detect differential methylation.",

For example, if a probe sequence lacks the restriction site for a methylation-sensitive enzyme that digests unmethylated target, the signal from this probe will be falsely assigned as methylated. In this work, we used bioinformatic tools to provide detailed annotation of all probes on a publicly available CpG island array and used this information to develop and validate a high-throughput method called microarray methylation assessment of a single sample (MMASS).

Most notably, the Nouzova method gave a very low and limited range of B statistics demonstrating a lack of power to assess methylation. In contrast, the MMASS-v2 and MMASS-sub methods resulted in much higher B values indicating better assessment of methylation. However, compared to the MMASS-v2 method, the MMASS-sub method was more variable as shown by the wide spread of points with low B values in the MMASSsub method volcano plot (Figure 3). The MMASS-v2 method resulted in markedly higher B values than the MMASS-v1 method. The poor discrimination of the Nouzova data was surprising. To exclude artefact caused by our use of indirect labelling or different hybridization conditions, we repeated the original protocol exactly as described for four additional arrays. No significant increase in performance was obtained by using the unmodified protocol (Supplementary Sweave document).",

The MA plots showed the mitochondrial DNA to be consistently unmethylated in data from the MMASS methods ( Figure 2). However the Nouzova et al. (19) method had poor sensitivity for distinguishing unmethylated mitochondrial genes. Ranking by B statistics showed that the top unmethylated probes were mitochondrial DNA sequences and that the most methylated probes were repeat elements (Figure 4). It is important to note that as mitochondrial and repetitive sequences are present in high copy number in the genome (36) and over-represented on the HCG12K arrays (see earlier), more consistent probe measurements would be expected, making it easier to detect differential methylation for these probes as compared to single copy genes.",

Although COBRA only surveys two to four CpGs in an amplicon, our experience in cancer samples is that this gives a good indication of the methylation status of the locus. Results from probes with A values higher than the median intensity of the A.thaliana control spots were more consistent with the COBRA results and these higher intensity probes were also more consistent across all MMASS methods (Figure 3 and Supplementary  Table 3).",

Validation of the methylation status of five CpG islands (PXMP4, SFRP2, DCC, RARB and the unmethylated housekeeping gene TSEN2) confirmed correct array results using COBRA or MSP (Supplementary Figure S7). Our array result for HNRPA2B1 ( Figure 6) was not in agreement with previous data that has shown it to be unmethylated in HCT116 (39) but we were unable to obtain a satisfactory MSP result to confirm this (data not shown). The reproducibility of the MMASS-v2 method was also demonstrated by the finding of very similar B values for several duplicate probes from single copy genes, including MCM7 ( Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S8). We also examined array data from 23 probes representing 9 genes (SYK, ZFP37, DIRAS3, RARB, LMX1A, DAPK1, SFRP2, FAT and RASSF1) that have been reported previously to be methylated in HCT116 (32,40).

The MMASS-sub method increased the power to resolve methylation differences as compared to the previously published Nouzova et al. (19) method, but also increased noise (Figure 3). The subtraction steps were time consuming, and there remains a theoretical disadvantage that the subtraction may compound errors caused by partial digestion. For example, an excess of the partially digested sequences in the subtracter DNA amplicon could result in disproportionate removal of target DNA and a skewed representation of methylation. The MMASS-v2 method resulted in better representation of the methylation status of the target DNA ( Figure 7) and had less noise, and therefore increased power, as compared to other methods (Figures 3 and 7). This may be in part because of better digestion of unmethylated sequences ( Figure 5). As additional fresh enzymes were added in the MMASS-v2 method and digestion was carried out in a single step using one buffer-enzyme combination, minimizing potential loss of sample.",

(19) method was surprising and cannot be explained simply by technical reasons, such as failure of McrBC digestion, as all experiments were carried out using the same conditions, batch of enzyme and in vitro methylated spikes. In addition, the dynamic range for probe data was very similar between our Nouzova experiments and the original publication. It is possible that other effects such as array quality or the higher genomic complexity of the amplicon from the undigested DNA (containing unmethylated and methylated sequences) may have altered spike-probe hybridization results. However in contrast to MMASS, the Nouzova method has very poor sensitivity for detecting hypomethylation (Figure 2) such as mitochondrial spots. The mixtures being compared by hybridization may have had strong effects on sensitivity. The direct comparison of methylated to unmethylated representations appears more sensitive (larger M values) than comparisons to a mixture of methylated and unmethylated sequences as in the Nouzova et al. (19) method. The MMASS methods resolved with high precision the methylation status for repetitive and mitochondrial target DNAs as these are represented in high copy number in the genome (Figure 4). They also were able to resolve single copy CpG methylation and identify correctly the methylation status of a number of CpG islands which have been described previously to be methylated or unmethylated in HCT116 (Figures 6 and 7).",

We show here that data distributions from different methods are inherently skewed and may be bi-modal at high intensities. It is not possible to estimate how much asymmetry to expect since this will depend upon the method used and global levels of methylation in the samples. We have carefully investigated and applied appropriate methods for these analyses. From these data it is clear that proper normalization is fundamentally reliant on exogenous controls including the spiked A.thaliana cDNA used here, but better reagents are needed. Significant collaborative efforts are now underway for designing reproducible control spikes for expression studies (43). It is important to note that use of simplistic locationbased normalization in other datasets is likely to have prevented detection of real effects and combining probe-level data between different datasets that have used different methods and comparator DNAs may be impossible to achieve.",

Optimization of this enzyme set was based on analysis of 5435 CpG island sequences and therefore likely to be of high utility to other CpG island platforms. This may also have contributed to the improved effects seen with the MMASS-v2 method. However, our analysis was limited by the low number of informative probes caused by inclusion of repeat and nonsense sequences from the original library. Improved array platforms with better representation of all CpG islands across the genome, as well as fine mapping within individual CpG islands, are now needed for detailed studies.",

Methylation analysis using BAC microarrays requires the use of rare cutting methylation-sensitive enzymes which limits resolution to a single BAC probe, or only provides an average estimate of methylation across a large genomic region (46,47). Other methods that have used within-sample comparison methylation analysis have either used non-optimized enzyme combinations (48) or complex specific linker/enzyme pairings that have not been shown to improve sensitivity (49). MMASS is able to resolve the overall methylation status of a single copy CpG island probe on a spectrum from mostly unmethylated to mostly methylated. Our results also show that in contrast to DMH and the Nouzova et al. (19) method, we were able to detect unmethylated sequences such as housekeeping genes ( Figure 6). This will be particularly important in the context of the human epigenome project and for cancer studies where comparison is needed for both methylated and unmethylated sequences (50). ",
