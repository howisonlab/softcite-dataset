The eye can be customized within the following parameters: shape, height, length, width, thickness, concavity, iris diameter, and pupil diameter. The customization process is user friendly, requiring numeric inputs or parametric adjustments. The final model is exported and processed by an open-source slicing software. 3 Using a commercially available and inexpensive dual extruder 3D-printer, the eye is printed with commonly available acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic, in any arrangement of colors. The model is then chemically de-burred and temporarily softened with acetone, then veined with red thread. The final model is then cast into resin.",

            "text": "The production of our 3D printed prosthetic eye is significantly faster than traditional methods, requiring a total of 85 minutes to complete. The process requires less than 10 minutes to customize, 30 minutes to print, and 45 minutes for post processing. Given access to the internet and a 3D printer, the raw cost breakdown for producing our prosthetic eye is: $0.03 for 1.7g of ABS, $0.11 for 3mL of resin, and $0.18 for 30mL of acetone; totaling $0.32 per prosthetic. Due to the automation of much of the process, the usual cost of labor is greatly reduced.",

            "text": "Although yielding excellent life-like results, the current process of hand making ocular prosthetics leads to high production costs and long production times. This raises accessibility issues for uninsured or underinsured patients, and patients in regions or countries where custom-made ocular prosthetics are unavailable. With the increasing popularity of 3D printers, many of which are becoming publicly available (i.e. schools/public libraries), the production of a customizable prosthetic eye will be a viable, less costly, and more accessible option in the near future.  Three-dimensional printing technology has been used in medicine for anatomical modeling, pre-operative planning, prosthetic construction, and most recently bioprinting. 1,2 The high purchase cost of 3D printers has previously limited their widespread use, causing surgeons to outsource 3D anatomic model manufacturing at an average cost of $4,000/print. 3 The development of \"desktop\" 3D printers has decreased printer purchasing costs from $45,000 (2001) to under $2,000 (2016), 4 providing an opportunity to bypass high-cost third-party manufacturing to create patient-customized 3D models. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration using a desktop 3D printer and open-access software to create patient-specific computerized tomography (CT)-based 3D models to guide skeletal deformity reconstructions.",
