            "text": "Objective To quantify and compare the time doctors and nurses spent on direct patient care, medicationrelated tasks, and interactions before and after electronic medication management system (eMMS) introduction. Methods Controlled pre-post, time and motion study of 129 doctors and nurses for 633.2 h on four wards in a 400-bed hospital in Sydney, Australia. We measured changes in proportions of time on tasks and interactions by period, intervention/control group, and profession. Results eMMS was associated with no significant change in proportions of time spent on direct care or medication-related tasks relative to control wards. In the post-period control ward, doctors spent 19.7% (2 h/10 h shift) of their time on direct care and 7.4% (44.4 min/ 10 h shift) on medication tasks, compared to intervention ward doctors (25.7% (2.6 h/shift; p=0.08) and 8.5% (51 min/shift; p=0.40), respectively). Control ward nurses in the post-period spent 22.1% (1.9 h/8.5 h shift) of their time on direct care and 23.7% on medication tasks compared to intervention ward nurses (26.1% (2.2 h/shift; p=0.23) and 22.6% (1.9 h/shift; p=0.28), respectively). We found intervention ward doctors spent less time alone ( p=0.0003) and more time with other doctors ( p=0.003) and patients ( p=0.009). Nurses on the intervention wards spent less time with doctors following eMMS introduction ( p=0.0001). Conclusions eMMS introduction did not result in redistribution of time away from direct care or towards medication tasks. Work patterns observed on these intervention wards were associated with previously reported significant reductions in prescribing error rates relative to the control wards.",

            "text": "The extent to which computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems significantly hinder or assist clinical work efficiency has been a subject of debate and investigation for over 20 years. Yet the evidence base to address this issue remains sparse. [1][2][3] Zheng and colleagues 4 recently drew attention to the poor and inconsistent methods used in conducting time and motion studies to measure the impact of systems on work patterns. Controlled studies to measure the effects of CPOE on doctors' work are rare and we identified no published controlled studies of the impact on hospital nurses' work. 1 2 4 Studies in ambulatory care [5][6][7][8][9] and speciality areas in hospitals, such as the ICU, 10 11 predominate. Despite considerable developments in CPOE systems, the body of evidence regarding the impact of these systems on doctors' and nurses' work on general hospital wards is relatively sparse and reliance continues to be placed on results from important early studies. 5 12 13 Significant advances have been made in understanding the ways in which systems may disrupt and enhance work patterns and qualitative studies have played a vital role in understanding the complex socio-technical issues associated with integrating information systems into clinical work. [14][15][16][17][18][19] However, concerns of clinicians regarding the impact that systems have on the efficiency of their work continue to be raised and are a significant barrier to adoption. [20][21][22] Prior to the imminent introduction of an electronic medication management system (eMMS) (with electronic prescribing and medication administration records (eMAR)), we interviewed 50 hospital clinicians (doctors and nurses) and managers to determine their expectations of system introduction. 23 Work practice change associated with the system was the most strongly and frequently raised issue by all groups. 23 Specific issues often center on the perceived increased time it takes for doctors to prescribe medications and for nurses to perform medication administration using a computer compared to paper medication charts. 7 22 24 As a result of this, there are concerns that there will be less time for clinicians to spend on direct patient care activities. 20 These beliefs are often in contrast to the system benefits promoted to clinicians, namely that information systems will improve efficiency and patient care. 21 25 Time savings are anticipated by re-distributing time across medication tasks. 12 For example, while it may take longer to type a prescription compared to writing it, the ability to modify existing orders rather than prepare new orders and to use ordersets is expected to save time. Redistribution of timebenefits to others is also anticipated. For example, improving the legibility of orders is expected to reduce nurses' time spent clarifying orders. However, there are few data available to indicate whether time savings made in a particular sub-task are offset by time losses in other sub-tasks to make medication practice more or less efficient overall. Qualitative studies have revealed that many doctors and nurses report both improved and worsening efficiency. [26][27][28] Improved sharing of medication information is possible with CPOE, but reduced face-to-face communication between clinicians has also been identified as a potentially negative impact of system introduction, but there is little quantitative evidence to clarify this issue. 15 29 We aimed to undertake a large controlled time and motion study of hospital doctors and nurses to measure whether the proportions of time spent in medication tasks, direct care, and communication with each other significantly changed following the introduction of an eMMS with electronic prescribing and eMAR.",

All wards had a CPOE system for ordering diagnostic tests and viewing results as well as ordering diets, transport, porters, and allied health consultations. The CPOE system did not allow clinical documentation. In the pre-intervention period, prescribing doctors wrote orders directly onto the medication chart. These charts were then used by nursing staff for medication administration. There was no intermediate transcription step between a prescriber's order and the final medication chart entry, as is the case in some countries. Clinical pharmacists undertake ward rounds and review patients' medication charts. They will notate or contact the prescribing physician if changes are required. However, this step is not a pre-requisite for nurses to administer medications once a physician has documented an order. This process did not change after eMMS implementation.",

Prescribers were required to use the system to prescribe medications in the post-period. Prescribing is mainly by menu selection of pre-prepared order sentences which are triggered upon drug selection and which can be modified by the prescriber. 'Care sets' allow for a group of related orders to be selected and ordered simultaneously with a single click. Active decision-support at the time consisted of allergy alerts and drug-drug interaction alerts set at the most severe level. During the intervention period, heparin infusions and patient controlled analgesia remained on paper charts. The intervention did not include bedside verification technology, for example, bar coding. Intervention wards had access to both computers on wheels (COWs) and fixed computers (desk PCs) to access the eMMS. The control wards continued to use paper medication charts in the post-period.",

Rosters (schedules) from each ward were used to calculate the full-time equivalents for each nurse classification (RN new graduate, RN 2-4 years, RN 5+ years, and CNS) and medical classification (intern, resident, and registrar). The sampling strategy was prepared in order to ensure all hours of the work day and weekdays were sampled proportionately to ensure the sample was representative. Representative sampling was used to determine the number of minutes that participants needed to be observed for each hour of the day for each classification. Following signed consent, nurses and doctors were assigned a study identification number, and demographic information regarding their age, classification, and length of experience was collected. We did not store staff names once a unique identifier was assigned and did not match data for individual staff in the pre-and post-periods. Nurses were given no prior warning of observation periods. Observers randomly allocated nurses to a list for each observation session according to the sampling strategy. If a nurse at the top of the list was not working that day, observers selected the next nurse on the list. A similar approach was used for doctors, but on occasion pre-arranged times were requested as doctors were more mobile and locating them in the hospital could be difficult without this step. Nurses were observed between the hours of 7:00 and 19:00 and doctors from 8:00 to 20:00 on weekdays. Nurses and doctors were observed while both on and off the ward. The Work Observation Method by Activity Timing (WOMBAT) method was applied. [30][31][32][33] This is a technique for undertaking direct observational studies of health professionals. Using software on a handheld computer, observers capture multi-dimensional aspects of work and communication patterns. The WOMBAT tool automatically captures all time data related to tasks and also details interruptions to work and multi-tasking (ie, tasks conducted in parallel). For example, details of tasks conducted in parallel, such as documenting and answering a question from a colleague, could be recorded and time-stamped automatically. Figure 1 provides a screenshot of the data collection tool. The tool can be reconfigured for different task types and study designs. Research teams interested in using this software should contact the corresponding author ( JIW).",

Doctors on the intervention wards spent a significantly greater proportion of their time with other doctors, largely due to an increase in the frequency of interactions (tasks per hour) (table 5). Nurses on the intervention wards spent a significantly lower proportion of time working with doctors following eMMS implementation compared to nurses on the control wards (4.2% decrease; p=0.0001; table 6). This was due to both fewer interactions (tasks per hour) and shorter interactions (mean task time) (table 6).",

The results provide little support for arguments that eMMS use results in redistribution of time away from direct patient care or towards medication tasks. However, task time redistribution did occur within some specific areas. Examination of medication sub-tasks showed that increases in time spent, for example, reviewing medications in the system, were compensated by reduced time in other areas. Increased time spent reviewing patients' medication charts may be a potentially positive work practice change for patient care, or indicate that it took longer to scroll through medication charts to find information relative to paper charts. These results suggest that eMMS use may result in a redistribution of time within and across medication-related tasks.",

Early research, such as that by Bates et al 12 published in 1994, showed that following CPOE introduction time spent by doctors ordering increased. They found medical interns significantly increased ordering time from 5.3% to 10.5% ( p<0.001) and surgical house officers from 6.4% to 15.5% ( p<0.001). However, they also found that the use of ordersets took less time using CPOE compared to paper. In a more recent before and after study of CPOE, Zheng et al 40 observed medical residents for 68 h in a pediatric intensive care unit. They found no significant change in the time doctors spent in direct care or ordering. Our results from a larger controlled study are consistent with these findings. Further, we provide some of the first such data on nurses' work patterns following CPOE introduction. CPOE systems and clinicians' computer skills are likely to have substantially improved over time and both may have contributed to reducing the potential negative impact of CPOE on clinicians' time.",

            "text": "Intervention ward doctors spent a significantly greater proportion of time with patients and other doctors. Interactions with patients may have increased as a result of the use of COWs at patients' bedsides, particularly during ward rounds. The increased time with other doctors may have been due to increased use of a shared doctors' room on wards in which several PCs are located. These hypotheses are consistent with observations from our previous studies of doctors' use of computing devices on wards with eMMS at this site. 41 We observed that paper medication charts were often reviewed and completed at the central nurses' work station. However, the eMMS moved these tasks to either the COWs or the PCs in the doctors' rooms. This physical shifting of work to another location may also have contributed to the observed significant decrease in interactions nurses had with doctors post-eMMS compared to control ward nurses. Interestingly, Zheng et al 40 also found that doctors spent a greater proportion of time interacting with patients (increasing from 1.18% to 4.05%; p<0.05) after compared to before CPOE implementation. However, as there was no control group in that study, it is not possible to be certain if this was associated with the CPOE system or a temporal change. No reasons for this increase in interactions were suggested by the authors. We found significant temporal changes in the proportion of time both nurses and doctors spent on direct patient care and medication tasks in the postperiod. This may reflect the increased complexity and age of hospital patients over time. This finding also starkly demonstrates the importance of controlled studies of work patterns.",

That study timed medication rounds and then used work sampling Table 6 Frequency and proportion of time nurses interacted with others during tasks before (pre) and after (post) electronic medication management system (eMMS) implementation over 20 h to determine time on medication tasks outside rounds, but did not consider time in non-medication tasks such as direct care or professional communication. Importantly, we are able to link the patterns of work observed in our study with previously published prescribing error rates from these same hospital wards during the same study periods. A review of the medication charts of 1948 patient admissions from these wards before and after eMMS implementation showed prescribing error rates significantly declined with eMMS by 66.1% (from 6.25 errors per admission (95% CI 5.23 to 7.28) to 2.12 (95% CI 1.71 to 2.54); p<0.0001), with no significant change in the prescribing error rates on three control wards. 43 Thus doctors on these eMMS wards achieved significant improvements in medication safety while devoting the same proportion of their time to medication and direct patient care tasks compared to doctors on the control wards where no improvement in prescribing error rates was observed.",

In relation to published research on this topic, our study has made advances in addressing methodological issues identified as problematic in previous studies. 40 Our study complies with the criteria outlined in the STAMP guidelines 40 in relation to observational work study designs. We applied a controlled design which allowed us to account for temporal changes in patterns of work. We worked closely with hospital staff to identify possible confounders. Hospital staff did not identify any significant policy or practice changes which occurred only in the intervention or control wards during this period. It is possible that other factors which we did not measure may have influenced our results. The large sample sizes, a sampling strategy to reflect both staff composition and work at different times of the day, and our ability to account for multi-tasking are particular strengths of the study. Limitations of our study include that we only examined weekday work. The results may thus not be representative of evenings or weekends. We only included four wards, and practices on wards may vary. However, we found that at baseline there were no significant differences in task time distributions for direct care, medication tasks, or professional communication by ward. A further potential limitation of the study was that both intervention wards were acute geriatric wards. However, it is important to note that almost all admissions to these wards were via the emergency department. Also this hospital has no general medicine service and therefore we believe that the findings are likely to be generalizable to general wards. Patients on these wards have a high number of medications and often complex medication regimens. Thus, we believe these wards with heavy prescribing and medication administration loads are good test cases regarding the impact of the eMMS on staff efficiency.",

Further, observational studies of clinicians in situ have suggested that the extent of behavior change is minimal. 34 49 50 We had high participation rates for nurses (80%) and doctors (69%). It is possible that doctors and nurses who did not participate were systematically different from the remaining population in terms of the factors under investigation, namely the amount of time that doctors and nurses spend particularly on medication tasks, and that these clinicians' work was affected in different ways to clinicians in the study. One of the most frequent reasons for not participating in the study was that a doctor was about to go on leave or move to another ward.
