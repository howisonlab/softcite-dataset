Native I-PpoI recognizes and cleaves a semi-palindromic 15-bp target site with high specificity in vivo and in vitro. This target site is present in the 28S or equivalent large subunit rDNA genes of all eukaryotes. I-PpoI variants able to bind mutant target site DNA had from 1 to 8 amino acid substitutions in the DNA-protein interface. Biochemical characterization of these proteins revealed a wide range of site-binding affinities and site discrimination. One-third of variants were able to cleave target site DNA, but there was no systematic relationship between site-binding affinity and site cleavage. Computational modeling of several variants provided mechanistic insight into how amino acid substitutions that contact, or are adjacent to, specific target site DNA base pairs determine I-PpoI site-binding affinity and site discrimination, and may affect cleavage efficiency."

            "text": "Proteins that bind DNA play a critical role in regulating gene structure, replication and expression in all organisms. Biochemical and structural analyses of proteins that bind specific DNA sequences have begun to provide insight into the molecular basis of both DNA binding and sequence-specific DNA recognition (1)(2)(3). These analyses have identified protein folds for DNA binding, together with a few general rules for the protein-mediated recognition of specific DNA bases (1,4,5). This work has also begun to suggest ways to modify the recognition specificity of existing, sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Two classes of site-specific DNA-binding proteins that have been the focus for efforts to engineer new DNA recognition specificities are the Type II restriction endonucleases (6), and sequence-specific transcription factors (1,7).",

This is a particularly attractive feature of homing endonucleases, in contrast to other potential genome engineering reagents such as zinc finger nucleases (11). High site specificity and tight coupling of site binding to catalysis may reflect the evolutionary history of many homing endonucleases: these two properties in concert permit the continued lateral transfer-and thus the persistence-of endonuclease-encoding mobile introns to related target sites, while minimizing spurious chromosome cleavage events (12,13).",

We had previously determined highresolution apo-and co-crystal structures of native and mutant forms of I-PpoI that allowed us to identify the molecular basis for high affinity site binding and cleavage (21,22). We had also identified amino acid changes that interfere with I-PpoI catalysis or site binding, together with DNA base-pair changes that disrupted target site cleavage by native I-PpoI protein (23)(24)(25)(26). These data were used to construct a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screening assay to identify I-PpoI protein variants able to bind a specific mutant target site in vivo.

An integrating version of Yep24-HIS3Ppo was constructed by transferring an EcoRI fragment containing a multiple-cloning site, minimal promoter and HIS3 gene into the yeast TRP1 integration vector pRS404, and then inserting three copies of the native or +6C/-6G mutant I-PpoI target site as described earlier Yeast containing an integrated copy of pRS404-HIS3Ppo were constructed by transforming MfeI-cleaved linear plasmid DNA into yeast strain W1588-4C (MATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112trp1-1 ura3-1 RAD5), followed by selection on SD media lacking tryptophan (29,30).

The corrected map and sequence of this plasmid can be found at: depts.washington.edu/sfields/protocols/pOAD.html. After removing flanking BamHI sites, the open reading frame of catalytically inactive H98A I-PpoI was inserted into the NcoI and PstI sites of pOAD to form pOAD-Ppo. A 3 kb insert or 'dummy' fragment was inserted into the NdeI-BamHI site in the I-PpoI ORF to create pOAD-Ppo+d. This 'dummy' fragment was subsequently replaced with an oligonucleotide insert encoding 25 codons of the I-PpoI ORF to restore the open reading frame and randomize I-PpoI residues N57, R61, Q63, K65 and R74. This insert was constructed by the annealing of three oligonucleotides, PPO(-)5, PPO+ NDEI and PPO NDEI SPLINT and ligation, at 500-fold molar excess, into NdeI-cut pOAD-Ppo+d. The PPO(-)5 oligonucleotide region containing randomized codons was converted to doublestranded DNA by primer extension with Klenow DNA polymerase prior to cleaving the resulting insert and plasmid with BamHI (31), ligation and electroporation into E. coli TB1 cells. The number of independent transformants was determined by plating a small portion of the pooled transformation, and the library was amplified by growth overnight in 1 l of L-broth followed by plasmid DNA isolation [(32); Qiagen MegaPrep]."

These base-pair positions are in a well-ordered part of the I-PpoI DNA-protein interface ( Figure 1A). Palindromic AE3 G>A/C>T and AE4 G>C/T>G base-pair substitutions were permissive of cleavage only at high protein concentrations (10 nM for the AE3 position; 1 mM for the AE4 position). In contrast, base-pair substitutions at positions AE5 (T>A/C>T), AE6 (A>C/T>G) and AE7 (G>A/C>T) completely inhibited cleavage at all protein concentrations tested ( Figure 1D; data not shown).

The H98A substitution was incorporated to abolish the catalytic activity of I-PpoI without disrupting high affinity site binding [ Figure 2A; (22,23,26)]. A Ppo-AD negative control protein was constructed by fusing L116A I-PpoI to the Gal4p activation domain. L116A I-PpoI is catalytically inactive, and does not bind I-PpoI target site DNA (26). Reporter activity was determined using a budding yeast HIS3 or plasmid-borne bacterial lacZ reporter genes located downstream of 1 or more I-PpoI target site and a minimal promoter ( Figure 2B). Site binding was quantified by the induction of b-galactosidase activity, and was strongest when the lacZ reporter gene was flanked by 6 direct repeats of the native I-PpoI target site: 25-to-75-fold above the 'no site' or negative control background. The Gal4-L116A Ppo-AD negative control protein did not induce reporter expression above background on any target site or number of repeats ( Figure 2C; data not shown).

Modeling indicates that Q63R substitutions can in part restore mutant site-binding affinity by making a new contact at base-pair position 5, and by restoring an R74:guanine 7 canonical base-pair contact ( Figure 4C). Modeling also provides an explanation for why selected variants with Q63R substitutions, e.g. variant E, show preferential binding of the mutant +6C/\u00c06G target site: when R63 packs in the native DNA interface, it leaves a small cavity adjacent to the native AE6 A/T base pairs.

Modeling indicates that the R61K substitution modifies backbone contacts in the native interface between base pair positions 3 and 4 ( Figure 4, compare panels B and C). These backbone positions are immediately adjacent to the scissile phosphate, and form part of the most deformed region of the I-PpoI:DNA substrate complex (21).

Variants were isolated using a mutant binding site target with symmetrical AE6 bp position substitutions that abolished site binding and cleavage by native I-PpoI. We reasoned that amino acid substitutions in the DNA-protein interface adjacent to this target site position, at contacting residue 63 alone or in conjunction with other substitutions, might restore high site-binding affinity and Figure 4.

(A) Geometry of position 6 contacting residue Q63 on native A:T and mutant C:G target sites. The mutant \u00c06C base (purple) forces Q63 to rotate 1358 to alleviate a stearic clash (shown as crossed arc lines). (B) Rotation of Q63 forced by the AE6C/G base-pair substitution disrupts the canonical R74:guanine contacts made at adjacent base-pair position 7. (C) Stereo representation of I-PpoI variant G modeled with the AE6C/G mutant DNA target. R63 interacts with AE5G, and allows R74 to again contact base pair position 7. R65 makes two H-bonds to target site base-pairs 8 and 9, which increases the overall affinity of I-PpoI for native and mutant DNA target sites. R61K substitutions alter DNA backbone contacts near the scissile phosphate between base pairs 2 and 3 (compare panel C with B or Figure 1A). specificity in vivo. This strategy resembles Y1H screens that have been used to identify and characterize sitespecific DNA-binding proteins from yeast and other organisms. One similar precedent reported for homing endonucleases was the use of a bacterial two-hybrid screen to explore the recognition specificity of the LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease PI-SceI (37).",

Most variants had low sitebinding affinities (100-1000 nM K d 's), and a modest (2to-10-fold) preference to bind native or mutant target site DNA. One exception, variant T with only a K65R substitution, had high binding affinities for native and mutant target site DNAs that included a clear (<175-fold) preference for native site binding. Cleavage competence was assayed by reverting the catalytically inactivating H98A substitution required to establish the Y1H screen, and then assaying proteins for the ability to cleave native or mutant target site DNAs. We found little correlation among site binding, discrimination and cleavage properties of individual variant proteins (Table 2 and Figure 3, panels C and D). One likely explanation for this is that I-PpoI must bind and bend substrate DNA in order to generate a productive substrate complex (21,22,26). Our hypothesis is that active variants (e.g. variants U, S or P, Figure 3A and Table 2) retain the ability to both bind and bend site DNA to permit cleavage.",

Sequence-specific hydrogen bonds are shown as black dotted lines. (B) Sequence of the native I-PpoI target or 'homing' site. Site cleavage across the minor groove (staggered line) generates complementary 4 base, 3 0 OH-extended single-stranded ends. The convention for numbering target site base-pair positions is shown above the top strand. (C) Sequence and cleavage sensitivity of native and five variant I-PpoI target sites with palindromic base substitutions (shown lower case bold) at positions AE3 to AE7 assayed for native I-PpoI cleavage sensitivity. Cleavage sensitivity is indicated to the right of each sequence ('+++', fully sensitive; '-', no cleavage). (D) Representative cleavage assays of native and mutant I-PpoI target sites by native I-PpoI protein. Linearized plasmid DNA (10 mM) was digested for 1 h with 10 pM to 1 mM native I-PpoI prior to agarose gel electrophoresis. ('uncut', plasmid substrates; 'cut', site-specific cleavage products).",

The H98A substitution abolishes I-PpoI catalytic activity without affecting site-binding affinity. (B) Reporter genes to detect in vivo binding of GAL4-I-PpoI were constructed in the yeast plasmid YEp24 or in the TRP1 integration vector pRS404 by inserting three direct repeats of native or mutant I-PpoI target site upstream of a minimal promoter and the budding yeast HIS3 or bacterial lacZ gene.

Plasmid DNA (10 nM) containing a native (WT, top panel) or +6C/-6G variant (bottom panel) target site was cut with XmnI to generate a 3 kb linear DNA substrate ('uncut') that was cleaved with 0.1 mM native (WT lanes) or variant I-PpoI protein (rightmost 8 lanes, Y to C) for 30 min at 378C. I-PpoI target site-specific cleavage generated 2 and 1 kb product fragments ('cut'). M = 1 kb DNA size marker (New England Biolabs). Controls include plasmid cleaved with XmnI alone (-lanes) or plasmid cleaved with XmnI, and with AflII that cleaves the central 6 bp of the I-PpoI target site (+ lanes). (B) In vivo yeast one-hybrid reporter gene activity of selected I-PpoI protein variants. LacZ reporter gene activity was determined by expressing specific proteins in yeast in the presence of native (site W) or +6C/-6G (site 6) I-PpoI target site reporter plasmids, then measuring b-galactosidase activity in permeabilized cells using ONPG as a substrate. Proteins included as controls were H98A Ppo-AD (98A; positive control) and L116A (116A; negative control). Variant T was assayed independently of the other five variants shown, and thus is displayed with a simultaneously performed H98A control (rightmost 4 bars). All activities represent the mean AE SD of three independent colonies grown and assayed on the same day. (C and D) Graphical summary of I-PpoI variant protein site binding and cleavage properties. Site-binding affinities (nM) for native (X axis) or +6C/-6G (Y axis) target site DNAs. Variant proteins with partial or full cleavage activity on native homing site DNA are indicated, respectively, by circled X's or filled circles. Only one I-PpoI variant protein, T, had any detectable cleavage activity on +6C/-6G target site DNA. The identities of the variants in the dashed line box in the upper right of panel C are shown in expanded panel D."

The ability of each I-PpoI variant to cleave native or +6C/-6G target site DNA was determined after reverting the catalytically inactivating H98A substitution that was required to establish the yeast one-hybrid assay. The final columns detail amino acid substitutions at nine positions in the DNA-protein interface. A blank box indicates presence of the native residue (shown top in single letter code).

The RD2 library had a predicted maximum complexity of 3.2 \u00c2 10 4 . Sequencing indicated that 67% of RD2 library plasmids had intact Ppo-AD open reading frames. Thus the completed RD2 library of 1.4 \u00c2 10 5 members was sufficiently large to include all designed RD2 variants."
