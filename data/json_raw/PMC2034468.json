Native I-PpoI recognizes and cleaves a semi-palindromic 15-bp target site with high specificity in vivo and in vitro. This target site is present in the 28S or equivalent large subunit rDNA genes of all eukaryotes. I-PpoI variants able to bind mutant target site DNA had from 1 to 8 amino acid substitutions in the DNA-protein interface. Biochemical characterization of these proteins revealed a wide range of site-binding affinities and site discrimination. One-third of variants were able to cleave target site DNA, but there was no systematic relationship between site-binding affinity and site cleavage. Computational modeling of several variants provided mechanistic insight into how amino acid substitutions that contact, or are adjacent to, specific target site DNA base pairs determine I-PpoI site-binding affinity and site discrimination, and may affect cleavage efficiency.",

Biochemical and structural analyses of proteins that bind specific DNA sequences have begun to provide insight into the molecular basis of both DNA binding and sequence-specific DNA recognition (1)(2)(3). These analyses have identified protein folds for DNA binding, together with a few general rules for the protein-mediated recognition of specific DNA bases (1,4,5). This work has also begun to suggest ways to modify the recognition specificity of existing, sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Two classes of site-specific DNA-binding proteins that have been the focus for efforts to engineer new DNA recognition specificities are the Type II restriction endonucleases (6), and sequence-specific transcription factors (1,7).",

This is a particularly attractive feature of homing endonucleases, in contrast to other potential genome engineering reagents such as zinc finger nucleases (11). High site specificity and tight coupling of site binding to catalysis may reflect the evolutionary history of many homing endonucleases: these two properties in concert permit the continued lateral transfer-and thus the persistence-of endonuclease-encoding mobile introns to related target sites, while minimizing spurious chromosome cleavage events (12,13).",

Target site inserts were prepared by annealing phosphorylated oligonucleotides (PPOSITES5 and PPOSITES6; all oligonucleotide sequences are given in Supplementary Data Table 1), or oligonucleotides that when annealed created three oriented copies of native or mutant I-PpoI target sites (oligonucleotides PPOX3_WT and _6 #1-4).

Expression plasmids for Ppo-activation domain (AD) fusion proteins were constructed by inserting I-PpoI open reading frame cassettes in-frame into the GAL4 activation domain plasmid pOAD (kindly provided by Stan Fields, University of WA, USA). The corrected map and sequence of this plasmid can be found at: depts.washington.edu/sfields/protocols/pOAD.html. After removing flanking BamHI sites, the open reading frame of catalytically inactive H98A I-PpoI was inserted into the NcoI and PstI sites of pOAD to form pOAD-Ppo. A 3 kb insert or 'dummy' fragment was inserted into the NdeI-BamHI site in the I-PpoI ORF to create pOAD-Ppo+d. This 'dummy' fragment was subsequently replaced with an oligonucleotide insert encoding 25 codons of the I-PpoI ORF to restore the open reading frame and randomize I-PpoI residues N57, R61, Q63, K65 and R74. This insert was constructed by the annealing of three oligonucleotides, PPO(-)5, PPO+ NDEI and PPO NDEI SPLINT and ligation, at 500-fold molar excess, into NdeI-cut pOAD-Ppo+d. The PPO(-)5 oligonucleotide region containing randomized codons was converted to doublestranded DNA by primer extension with Klenow DNA polymerase prior to cleaving the resulting insert and plasmid with BamHI (31), ligation and electroporation into E. coli TB1 cells. The number of independent transformants was determined by plating a small portion of the pooled transformation, and the library was amplified by growth overnight in 1 l of L-broth followed by plasmid DNA isolation [(32); Qiagen MegaPrep].",

These base-pair positions are in a well-ordered part of the I-PpoI DNA-protein interface ( Figure 1A). Palindromic AE3 G>A/C>T and AE4 G>C/T>G base-pair substitutions were permissive of cleavage only at high protein concentrations (10 nM for the AE3 position; 1 mM for the AE4 position). In contrast, base-pair substitutions at positions AE5 (T>A/C>T), AE6 (A>C/T>G) and AE7 (G>A/C>T) completely inhibited cleavage at all protein concentrations tested ( Figure 1D; data not shown). Of the six possible base-pair changes from the native +6A/\u00c06T target site, +6A>C/\u00c06T>G substitutions most strongly inhibited site cleavage by native I-PpoI ( Figure 1C and D; data not shown).

To establish this assay, we fused a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal4p transcriptional activation domain to the N-terminus of catalytically inactive H98A I-PpoI to generate Ppo-AD. The H98A substitution was incorporated to abolish the catalytic activity of I-PpoI without disrupting high affinity site binding [ Figure 2A; (22,23,26)]. A Ppo-AD negative control protein was constructed by fusing L116A I-PpoI to the Gal4p activation domain. L116A I-PpoI is catalytically inactive, and does not bind I-PpoI target site DNA (26). Reporter activity was determined using a budding yeast HIS3 or plasmid-borne bacterial lacZ reporter genes located downstream of 1 or more I-PpoI target site and a minimal promoter ( Figure 2B). Site binding was quantified by the induction of b-galactosidase activity, and was strongest when the lacZ reporter gene was flanked by 6 direct repeats of the native I-PpoI target site: 25-to-75-fold above the 'no site' or negative control background. The Gal4-L116A Ppo-AD negative control protein did not induce reporter expression above background on any target site or number of repeats ( Figure 2C; data not shown). We performed all subsequent library screens using reporter genes flanked by three target sites, as these reporters could be readily constructed and gave reporter activity well above background.",

Ppo-AD variants D, H, K and L were independently isolated, from 3 to 6 times each from RD2, as indicated by plasmid molecular bar code sequences. In addition to these library variants, we constructed nine I-PpoI variants (variants P to Y, Table 2) by site-directed mutagenesis. This was done to determine the contribution of specific amino acid residues identified in the CR, RD1 and RD2 libraries to target site binding and cleavage. We reasoned that specific residue substitutions in library isolates might promote or interfere with site binding and cleavage, and thus wanted to assay individual substitutions in defined sequence contexts. These site-directed mutants were generated, in consequence, in either the native or variant A or C I-PpoI sequence contexts.",

Modeling indicates that Q63R substitutions can in part restore mutant site-binding affinity by making a new contact at base-pair position 5, and by restoring an R74:guanine 7 canonical base-pair contact ( Figure 4C). Modeling also provides an explanation for why selected variants with Q63R substitutions, e.g. variant E, show preferential binding of the mutant +6C/\u00c06G target site: when R63 packs in the native DNA interface, it leaves a small cavity adjacent to the native AE6 A/T base pairs. This cavity is partially filled by the cytosine in the +6C/-6G substrate (Figures 1A and  4B; data not shown). These results indicate that the native contacting residue, Q63, acts as a gatekeeper at the AE6 A:T base pair by controlling contacts at this and adjacent base-pair positions.",

This strategy resembles Y1H screens that have been used to identify and characterize sitespecific DNA-binding proteins from yeast and other organisms.

Most variants had low sitebinding affinities (100-1000 nM K d 's), and a modest (2to-10-fold) preference to bind native or mutant target site DNA. One exception, variant T with only a K65R substitution, had high binding affinities for native and mutant target site DNAs that included a clear (<175-fold) preference for native site binding. Cleavage competence was assayed by reverting the catalytically inactivating H98A substitution required to establish the Y1H screen, and then assaying proteins for the ability to cleave native or mutant target site DNAs. We found little correlation among site binding, discrimination and cleavage properties of individual variant proteins (Table 2 and Figure 3, panels C and D). One likely explanation for this is that I-PpoI must bind and bend substrate DNA in order to generate a productive substrate complex (21,22,26). Our hypothesis is that active variants (e.g. variants U, S or P, Figure 3A and Table 2) retain the ability to both bind and bend site DNA to permit cleavage.",

This may be the case for the initial randomized contacting residue (CR) library, which was too large to be exhaustively screened. The smaller rationally designed libraries (RD1 and RD2), in contrast, were exhaustively screened but may have been too small to encode a high affinity binding variant.",

Computational DNA-protein interface design can be used to predict different residue substitutions that may confer high binding affinity and specificity for a mutant target site DNA. The resulting protein variants can then be rank-ordered on the basis of predicted DNA-binding energies, and further evaluated for structural quality by molecular modeling. This general approach has already been shown to work for single basepair positions in I-MsoI, a member of the LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease family (40), and should be applicable to His-Cys box proteins such as I-PpoI. A prerequisite for this engineering approach is a high resolution co-crystal structure.",

They encode a wide range of different DNA recognition specificities, and display high site-binding specificity that is tightly linked to DNA cleavage. Homing endonucleases including I-PpoI have already been successfully expressed in human cells. They cleave their target sites with high site specificity (19,(42)(43)(44), and thus are being used to promote site-specific recombination (45) and high resolution DNA double-strand break repair analyses (20). The precedents outlined above indicate that it should be possible in the near future to generate many highly sequence-specific homing endonuclease variants useful for genome engineering, disease therapy or disease prevention. design, library construction and graphics support.
