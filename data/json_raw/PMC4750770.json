Objective outcomes such as radiographs may be important, but these might not really matter if the patient's perception of the outcome is negative. In fast-track surgery (Kehlet and Wilmore 2008, Husted et al. 2010b, Kehlet 2013, with the increased focus on reduced length of stay (LOS) it is even more important to look at the results of treatment and care from the patient's point of view. Approximately 18,000 patients in Denmark underwent THR and TKR in 2012 (Danish Hip Arthroplasty Register 2013, Danish Knee Arthroplasty Register 2013), making these amongst the more common surgical procedures. Since the year 2000, fast-track surgery has been implemented in all Danish departments performing THR and TKR and it has reduced LOS from 10-11 days in 2000 to 4 days in 2009 (Husted et al. 2012).",

It has been shown that a random variation exists between surgeons (Randsborg et al. 2010). We therefore checked to determine whether the operating surgeon should be included as a random variable, taking into account the random variation across surgeons using linear mixed-effect model analysis. The statistical assumptions for a linear mixed-effect model analysis apply to both the between-subjects and within-subjects effects. The between-subjects assumptions are the same as those in a standard regression analysis: the independence of scores, normality of the residuals, and equal variances (known as homogeneity of variance). As this was not the case, we applied cluster robust standard errors using the Hubert-White sandwich estimator. This relaxes the assumption of independence, thus producing \"correct\" standard errors (in the measurement sense) even if the observations are correlated. Even so, caution is needed in interpreting the results. In addition, the mixed model also assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, equality of variances of the difference scores for all pairs of scores at all levels of the within-subjects factor, and equal covariances for the between-subjects factor. This assumption is known as the sphericity assumption. Sphericity is especially important for mixed model analysis. Bartlett's test for sphericity was performed to test for this, and it showed no statistically significant departure from the sphericity assumption. Thus, we decided to assess the intraclass correlation of the model using a linear mixed model with robust standard errors-as the assumptions for this model appeared to be fulfilled. If a statistically significant intraclass correlation was evident, a mixed linear regression model was used; if not, then \"normal\" OLS linear regression with robust standard errors was used. As no significant intraclass correlation was found, a \"normal\" OLS linear regression with robust standard errors was performed and q-q normal plots were used to check for normality of the residuals of the model. STATA 13 and SPSS 17.1 were used for the analyses.",

Our results support the existing evidence that fast-track pathways for orthopedic patients do not compromise patient satisfaction (Jones et al. 2014).  Factors related to overall satisfaction Bivariate analyses: No association was found between overall satisfaction and age group (THR and TKR), sex (THR), or LOS (TKR). In TKR patients men had higher overall satisfaction than women, with a median NRS score of 10 for men and 9 for women (p = 0.03) ( Table 3).

Both groups of patients had similarly high scores in all parameters, except in the first weeks at home where TKR patients gave a lower score than THR patients. A qualitative investigation of the lowest-scoring parameter, in the first weeks after discharge, is required to learn more about the kinds of challenges that patients deal with at home. No relationship was found between overall satisfaction and comorbidity, except in TKR patients with diabetes. Older THR patients were more satisfied.",
