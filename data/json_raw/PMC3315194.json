Skeletal muscles can develop into two types: fast and slow, depending on the expression pattern of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms. Previous studies reported that exercise altered the distribution of muscle fiber types. It is not currently known what changes in the expression of caveolins and types of muscle fiber occur in response to the intensity of exercise. This study determined the changes in expression of caveolins and MHC type after forced exercise in muscular and non-muscular tissues in rats. A control (Con) group to which forced exercise was not applied and an exercise (Ex) group to which forced exercise was applied. Forced exercise, using a treadmill, was introduced at a speed of 25 m/min for 30 min, 3 times/day (07:00, 15:00, 23:00). Homogenized tissues were applied to extract of total RNA for further gene analysis. The expression of caveolin-3 and MHC2a in the gastrocnemius muscle of female rats significantly increased in the Ex group compared with the Con group (P<0.05). Furthermore, in the gastrocnemius muscle of male rats, the expression of MHC2x was significantly different between the two groups (P<0.05). There was an increased expression in caveolin-3 and a slightly decreased expression in TGF\u03b2-1 in muscular tissues implicating caveolin-3 influences the expression of MHC isoforms and TGF\u03b2-1 expression. Eventually, it implicates that caveolin-3 has positive regulatory function in muscle atrophy induced by neural dysfunction with spinal cord injury or stroke.",

The MHC gene family consists of eight isoforms and four types are expressed in adult skeletal muscle: slow MHC and fast MHC, of which there are three isoforms, 2a, 2x, and 2b (or MHC 2A , MHC 2X , and MHC 2B ) [13]. The three adult fast MHC isoforms are expressed in different types of skeletal muscle fibers and have different physiological characteristics, with 2A fibers being smaller, slower, and more oxidative, 2B fibers typically being the largest, fastest, and most glycolytic, and 2X or 2D/X fibers falling between these extremes [14]. Physical activity, including exercise, can alter the properties of MHC isoforms and change the isoform content [15].",

Caveolins are integral membrane proteins that play a role in essential cellular functions. They normally have two main functions: intracellular transport of signaling molecules and transmitters [17]. The caveolin gene family consists of caveolin-1, -2, and -3. Caveolin-1 has been reported to interact with various intracellular signaling molecules, including growth factors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [18] and estrogen receptor (ER) [19]. Caveolin-3 is expressed in a muscle-specific manner and mutations in caveolin-3 cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy, leading to apoptosis of skeletal muscle [20]. Loss of caveolin-3 resulting from dominant-negative mutations in the caveolin-3 gene causes autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1C (LGMD1C).",

Over-expression of myostatin causes severe muscular atrophy [22,23], whereas targeted disruption of myostatin markedly increases muscle mass in mice [21,24]. Recently, caveolin-1 was reported to inhibit the activation of the type I receptor for TGF\u03b2-1, which induces growth arrest in non-muscle cells [25]. Accordingly, an increase in myostatin activity, resulting from loss of caveolin-3 in muscle, might participate in the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle atrophy in LGMD1C patients [26]. However, it remains unclear how caveolin gene expression changes after forced exercise and the relevance of such on shifts on the type of MHC isoforms. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the changes of expression of caveolins, MHC type, and TGF\u03b2-1 after forced exercise, using treadmills, in muscular and non-muscular tissues.",

These results suggest that forced exercise may induce shifts between the MHC-2a and -2x isoforms in the gastrocnemius of male and female rats.

Reduced synthesis rates of MHC are also observed [35], and mitochondrial dysfunction, which may arise as a result of oxidative stress, together with a decline in glycolytic enzyme activity, may lead to decreased energy production in aging skeletal muscles [36]. Furthermore, the paralyzed muscles of individuals with chronic traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) are characterized by a high distribution of \"fast\" muscle fibers (type II), and in some instances by the complete exclusion of any slow fibers in what would normally be mixed fiber type muscles. Thus, MHC isoform expression appears to be altered by an increase in MHC II [37,38]. Oxidative stress, such as by nitric oxide (NO), down regulates caveolin-3 levels, due to an alteration in the DNA-binding activity of the muscle transcription factor myogenin, resulting in cachexia [39], while endurance training promotes a shift in the opposite direction, 2B\u21922X\u21922A\u21921 [34]. Many previous studies have reported the effects of exercise on changes in muscle fiber type [1,[40][41][42].",

The gastrocnemius of female rats showed an increased expression of MHC2a in the Ex group, compared with the Con group. These results suggest that caveolin-3 may regulate shifts in the expression of MHC isoforms by inhibiting the expression of TGF\u03b2-1. Further studies are needed to investigate how caveolins are related to the physiology of skeletal muscles and the mechanism of interaction between caveolins and TGF\u03b2-1 in shifts in MHC type after physical exercise.",

We obtained the following results: The expression of MHC-2x was increased significantly in gastrocnemius of male-exercise group compared with the male-contol group. Also, the expression of caveolin-3 and MHC-2a were increased significantly in gastrocnemius of female-exercise group compared with the female-conrol group.
