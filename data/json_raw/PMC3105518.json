(Note that channel pore blockers are widely known, but those work by competitive inhibition rather than by an allosteric mechanism at a site away from the channel pore.) Recently, a new form of negative agonism has been described for cGMP acting on CNG channels. CNG channels are nonselective cation channels activated by direct binding of cGMP and cAMP; the channels consist of homotetramers or heterotetramers of homologous subunits. Each subunit has a conserved architecture of six transmembrane helices and a cytoplasmic C-terminal region that contains the ligand-binding domain (BD). Cells such as photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons express various types of CNG subunits (i.e., paralogues) in different combinations (Bradley et al., 2001; Kaupp and Seifert, 2002; Matulef and Zagotta, 2003). Negative agonism is observed in a particular subtype of CNG channels-the CNGA2 subtype from catfish olfactory neurons (fCNGA2) (Goulding et al., 1992)-and in recombinant CNG channels derived from this subtype (Young et al., 2001; Chan and Young, 2009). Notably, the dose-response relation of activity versus cGMP concentration shows a rising phase for low concentrations and",

            "text": "The activation of signaling receptors by agonists is explained mechanistically by classical allosteric coupling theory (Monod et al., 1965): the agonist's interactions with its binding site are more stable when the receptor is in an activated conformation compared with in a deactivated conformation. Negative or inverse agonists are ligands that allosterically reduce receptor activity; their receptor interactions are \"counterproductive,\" being more stable for the deactivated conformation than for the activated conformation (Costa and Herz, 1989). Efforts at efficient rational drug design would benefit greatly from a mechanistic understanding of the counterproductive interactions that make a ligand specifically into a negative agonist instead of a conventional (positive) agonist (Bond and Ijzerman, 2006). Historically, numerous negative agonists are known for metabotropic (G protein-coupled) receptors (Kenakin, 2004), but there are rather fewer known instances of negative agonism in ionotropic receptors (ligand-gated ion channels); examples include the NMDA receptor (Mony et al., 2009) and members of the Cys-loop superfamily like the GABA A and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Olsen et al., acts will depend on the receptor structure, and previously bound ligands must be included in describing that receptor structure. In the thermodynamic cycle for pro action at the left side of the Fig. 1 reaction scheme, cGMP binding preferentially stabilizes the open channel only when the number of bound ligands is less than some critical number, m. When some partially liganded channel state is attained (m ligands in Fig. 1), the coupling relationship between binding and gating becomes reversed. Subsequent binding of the same agonist species now preferentially destabilizes the open state (con action) with counterproductive interactions.",

            "text": "Con action in CNG channels represents a special example of negative agonism that manifests \"alongside\" positive agonism, caused by the same cGMP ligand species and relying on the same BD region. Thus, it becomes pressing to clarify the causal relationship between them. For instance, the previous BD substitution studies found that the rCNGA4 BD not only imparted normal cGMP agonism but also imparted a much higher efficacy of pro action by both cGMP and cAMP compared with the fCNGA2 BD. Might the particular structural deficiencies responsible for poor pro-action efficacy in fCNGA2 be necessary for operation of the con-action mechanism? If true, this would imply that any future compounds selected for effective con action in fCNGA2 will fail to induce con action in any of the numerous CNG channels whose pro-action mechanism is highly efficient. Conversely, might the poor pro-action efficacy be in itself sufficient to bring a con-action mechanism into operation? If true, this would imply that cGMP-negative agonism should already operate in every example of a low efficacy CNG channel, perhaps going undiscovered because higher cGMP concentrations were not previously tested. Here, we identify counterexamples against both the necessity hypothesis and the sufficiency hypothesis. That is, we show that con-action and low pro-action efficacy, the two distinctive functional features of the fCNGA2 BD, derive from independently operating structural determinants in the BD and are thus not causally related. Moreover, we isolate a single residue in the fCNGA2 BD with a critical role in con action, opening the door for future elucidation of a specific mechanism for negative agonism in CNG channels.",

            "text": "Recombinant DNA Previous reports (Tibbs et al., 1997;Young et al., 2001) have described the design of the \"X-chimera\" series of BD substitution constructs, with invariant non-BD sequence derived from bovine CNGA1 (bCNGA1; Kaupp et al., 1989) and fCNGA2 (Goulding et al., 1992). New X-chimera constructs were generated with previously reported PCR/restriction/ligation techniques (Young and Krougliak, 2004), incorporating BD sequences from fCNGA2, residues L455-A583, and from rCNGA4 (Bradley et al., 1994;Liman and Buck, 1994), residues L356-A484. Some constructs a falling phase for higher concentrations. This contrasts with the normal (monotonically rising) dose-response curve of the positive agonist cAMP. Single-channel recordings have shown (Young et al., 2001) that the falling phase of the cGMP dose-response reflects a decrease in steady-state open probability (P o ) induced by a new cGMP molecule binding to a partially liganded channel (see reaction scheme in Fig. 1). That is, it does not involve a reduction of open-channel unitary conductance as typically found with agonist pore block (Ogden and Colquhoun, 1985;Karashima et al., 2007), or a spontaneous gate-closing conformational change as found with traditional desensitization in ligand-gated channels (Cachelin and Colquhoun, 1989;Robert and Howe, 2003) or inactivation in voltage-gated channels (Hoshi et al., 1991). We have termed this unusual phenomenon bimodal agonism because cGMP exhibits two opposite modes of action: \"pro action\" that enhances receptor activity by a positive agonism mechanism, and \"con action\" that suppresses activity by a negative agonism mechanism. Our distinct terminology \"con action\" is used to denote negative agonism in this special context where more than one agonism mode is possible.",

A neutral agonism mechanism, where cGMP is displaced from its pro-action site by a competitor molecule that binds open and closed channels equally, is ruled out because the agonist responsible for con action is cGMP itself. BD substitution studies showed that although the fCNGA2 BD imparted bimodal cGMP agonism and normal cAMP agonism, the BD from the rat CNGA4 type (rCNGA4; Bradley et al., 1994;Liman and Buck, 1994) imparted solely normal cGMP and cAMP agonism. Thus, particular sequences within the fCNGA2 BD are required for con action (Young et al., 2001;Chan and Young, 2009), as would be expected for a modification of gating under BD-mediated control. Negative agonism acting through the BD is previously unknown in CNG channels because the known \"antagonists\" such as phosphorothioate analogues (Kramer and Tibbs, 1996) are merely weakly effective (\"partial\") positive agonists. It may be noted that the cGMP affinity of the binding site responsible for con action seems to be weak (millimolar) in constructs containing the fCNGA2 BD, but it is in fact comparable to the cAMP affinity of canonical pro-action sites in the same channels. Moreover, the operation of con action in heteromeric CNG channels (with fCNGA2 sequence in only two of four BDs) is conditional on subunit arrangement, consistent with the notion that the mechanism requires a specific geometry in the ligandchannel complex (Chan and Young, 2009).",

X-fA2 contains the fCNGA2 BD sequence and reconstitutes the gating and permeation characteristics of intact fCNGA2, just with improved levels of homologous expression resulting from selected non-BD sequence substitutions. Notably, the dose-response curves of X-fA2 for both cGMP and cAMP match those of intact fCNGA2, including matching maximal P o values (Young et al., 2001). A subsequent series of BD substitution constructs (X-chimeras) were based on substituting BD sequence in the original X-fA2 parent (Young et al., 2001;Young and Krougliak, 2004;Chan and Young, 2009). This enables comparisons of the activation properties of various BD sequences, set within one context of invariant non-BD sequence (Fig. 2 A). Each X-chimera subunit can be expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes to form functional homomeric CNG channels, which are then assayed as in Fig. 1 (inside-out excised patch clamp with agonist solutions perfused on the cytoplasmic side).",

Therefore, if there exists a critical residue, it must be located at the amino end of the BD, within the region spanning helix \ue061A through strand \ue0623 (to be discussed further in a later section).",

In this study, we substituted subsets of these 36 nonconserved residues with their rCNGA4 counterparts and tested the effects on cGMP gating. The BD is homologous to those of other cyclic nucleotide-dependent proteins (Weber et al., 1982;Kaupp et al., 1989), with an N-terminal helix (\ue061A), a \ue062-roll fold (strands \ue0621-\ue0628), and two C-terminal helices (\ue061B-C); an additional \"PB\" helix and loop interrupt the \ue062 roll. The PB elements form a conserved \"cassette\" that participates in ligand binding in all known cyclic nucleotide-dependent proteins using the BD (Diller et al., 2001). The 36 nonconserved residues are spread throughout the BD. Any of the fCNGA2 BD residues that we substituted might be \"critical\" for con action, meaning that its substitution would abolish con action; there might be several such critical residues. Or, substitution of one or more fCNGA2 residues might not abolish con action but might instead modify quantitative features of the falling phase in the cGMP doseresponse curve. Such residues would be properly described as \"contributing\" to con action but not critical for it. In addition, substitutions might change pro-action efficacy; this would modify the quantitative features of the rising phase of the dose-response curve. The key questions are whether it might be possible to increase proaction efficacy without abolishing con action (showing that low pro action is not necessary for con action), and whether it might be possible to abolish con action without increasing pro-action efficacy (showing that low pro action is not sufficient for con action).",

            "text": "We had previously constructed Constructs 1 and 2 with portions of the C-terminal region of the fCNGA2 BD replaced with rCNGA4 residues (Fig. 2 B); both of these constructs were bimodal (Young et al., 2001;Chan and Young, 2009). We extended the X-chimera series with Constructs 3 and 4, replacing larger amounts of C-terminal sequence from the fCNGA2 BD, and these progressive replacements increased the value of the ratio g (10 mM cGMP) /g (3 mM cGMP) . Indeed, the g (10 mM cGMP) /g (3 mM cGMP) value for Construct 3 is very close to unity (although still significantly less, P < 0.02), and the value for Construct 4 is not significantly different than unity (P > 0.3). These results might suggest a critical role for some of the 10 fCNGA2-specific residues from \ue0625 through the PB cassette. However, surprisingly, we were able to construct a counterexample to this hypothesis: starting from a Chimera 4 background, we added back a set of seven fCNGA2-specific residues in another region, \ue0627 through the B helix, and in doing so we \"rescued\" con action. The resulting Construct 5 has a ratio of g (10 mM cGMP) /g (3 mM cGMP) = 0.72 \u00b1 0.12 (n = 7), significantly below unity (P < 0.001). Simple allosteric reaction scheme for bimodal agonism. Reaction scheme (Chan and Young, 2009) is illustrated by a cell-free inside-out macroscopic patch recording of bimodal CNG channels with cGMP washed into and out from the bath (solid and dashed black bars, respectively). Applying cGMP elicits inward channel current with no desensitization up to 3 mM cGMP, but with 10 mM cGMP, the steady-state macroscopic conductance (white arrow) is smaller than for 3 mM. During wash-in and washout of the 10-mM cGMP solution, there are brief intervals with bath cGMP concentration near 3 mM giving rise to \"spikes\" of maximal conductance. Details of reaction scheme notation: Closed-(C) and open-(O) channel states are equilibrating rapidly compared with agonist wash-in and wash-out. Sizes of black reaction arrows indicate the favored direction of equilibrium. P o increases with cGMP binding of up to m molecules of cGMP (pro action). Binding of the (m+1) th cGMP molecule decreases the steady-state P o (con action) to below the value obtained with m ligands. Experimental details of current trace: The previously characterized channel, X-fA2, incorporates the BD from fCNGA2 channel in a chimera with sequence from other CNG channel types (see Young et al., 2001, and Fig. 2). X-fA2 was expressed as homomers in Xenopus oocytes; patches were held at \ue03240 mV. White arrows mark times where steady-state conductance, g, was measured with cGMP concentrations fixed at their nominal concentrations; for this example, g (10 mM cGMP) /g (3 mM cGMP) = 0.63. fCNGA2-specific residues in the PB cassette were not critical for con action, we anticipated that they might be important determinants of the low pro-action efficacy of X-fA2.",

Thus, introducing the rCNGA4 PB cassette sequence into the background of Construct 2 resulted in higher P o values for cGMP agonism. However, with a bimodal dose-response curve, cGMP pro action cannot be reliably quantified separately from con action; even at low cGMP concentrations, some binding events may be operating with con action at the same time as other binding events are operating with pro action.

The trajectory of PB cassette movement in the normal (pro) action of cyclic nucleotide-activated proteins is proposed to be essentially the same whether the binding agonist is cGMP or cAMP (Canaves and Taylor, 2002;Flynn et al., 2007). Thus, our results are consistent with PB cassette replacement in Construct 3 causing a general increase in efficacy for both cAMP and cGMP.

This might suggest that some defect in the structural apparatus for pro action might be necessary (a prerequisite) for con action. This necessity hypothesis could be disproven if a counterexample were found, namely a channel with both efficient con action and efficient pro action. In this light, Construct 3 provides the first example of a bimodal CNG channel whose cGMP pro action is efficient enough to produce P o > 0.7. We note that Construct 3 also had a higher value for g (10 mM cGMP) /g (3 mM cGMP) compared with the other bimodal channels, which might suggest that its conaction mechanism was not as efficient. However, as we explain below, it is not true that an increase in g (10 mM cGMP) /g (3 mM cGMP) always indicates attenuation of con action in mechanistic or energetic terms, and the doseresponse curves of Construct 3 match what would be predicted if the con action was unaffected by PB cassette replacement.

(A) Dose-response relations of Construct 3 activated with cGMP (down-triangles) or cAMP (up-triangles). Points show means and error bars show SD (n \u2265 3 for each point); points are joined by straight lines without fitting. To plot P o values, conductances were normalized to the steady-state conductance measured at 3 mM cGMP (solid downtriangle) in the same patch. Then, P o at 3 mM cGMP was fixed as 0.73 based on Ni 2+ potentiation (see Materials and methods). For comparison, gray curves show dose-response relations for Construct 2 activated by cGMP (solid) or cAMP (dashed); these were previously reported on a relative scale without conversion to P o values (Chan and Young, 2009), and new Ni 2+ potentiation experiments in this study fix the P o at 3 mM cGMP as 0.18. All measures for both constructs in this plot were collected after completion of spontaneous run-up. (B) Example macroscopic current trace from one patch of Construct 3 before and after completion of run-up, tracking progressive increase in pro-action efficacy and masking of con action. P o scale at right is based on fixing P o = 0.73 for 3 mM cGMP after run-up. Arrows and asterisks, respectively, mark steady-state and spike currents as in Fig. 1. For this example, P steady /P spike = 0.80 before run-up and 0.95 after run-up. P < 0.008). This is consistent with the masking of con action arising progressively as P o increases during run-up.",

Construct 3 possesses both efficient con action and efficient pro action, which suggests strongly that the poor pro-action efficacy exemplified by X-fA2 is not a prerequisite mechanistic condition for the operation of con action. That is, low pro-action efficacy is not necessary for con action. Construct 3 does not exclude the possibility that a disabled pro-action mechanism could be sufficient in itself to induce operation of con action.",

We found above (Fig. 2) that many fCNGA2 residues from \ue0625 through \ue061C were not critical for con action. Therefore, we performed another mutagenesis search with progressive replacements in the N-terminal region of the BD. We knew from previous work (Young et al., 2001) that con action could indeed be abolished by replacing very extensive N-terminal sequence (Fig. 4 A, Construct 6). The new Constructs 7 and 8 contain BD sequences >94% identical to the fCNGA2 BD, yet like Construct 6, they both lack con action ( Fig. 4 A); wash-in and wash-out current spikes were never observed either before or after run-up, and steadystate activity increased with cGMP concentration up to 30 mM ( Fig. 4 B, solid down-triangles). Thus, substitution of as few as three residues (in helix \ue061A and strand \ue0621 of Construct 8) abolished observable evidence for con action in the range of 3-30 mM cGMP (we phrase this statement conservatively because we could not test cGMP concentrations above 30 mM because of viscosity and solubility problems, and it is in any case impossible to prove a negative assertion for all possible conditions). Notably, bimodal agonism was observed in another Construct 9 where strands \ue0622 and strands \ue0623 were replaced, showing that those sequence elements are not critical for con action.",

This shows that the \ue061A-\ue0621 replacement did not a single open and closed state). As the numerical value of P o increases toward unity, the P o parameter becomes less sensitive to changes in the gating equilibrium constant (Varnum and Zagotta, 1996). Thus, if a structural modification (for example, PB cassette replacement) were to increase pro-action efficacy without affecting other gating features, this would as a consequence also flatten the P o versus concentration curve, so that significant concentration-dependent changes in gating energetics caused by either pro or con action would be \"masked.\"",

As a surrogate parameter, we can calculate Z = P o /(1\ue032P o ) from the average P o at a given subsaturating cGMP concentration; Z represents an approximate central value, around which the individual equilibrium constants in the channel population will be clustered. This analysis shows that as cGMP concentration increases from 3 to 10 mM, Z decreases by a similar factor for both Constructs 2 and 3. For Construct 2, Z changes by a factor of 0.7, decreasing from 0.23 at 3 mM cGMP (P o = 0.18) to 0.15 at 10 mM cGMP (P o = 0.13); for Construct 3, Z changes by a factor of 0.8, decreasing from 2.6 at 3 mM cGMP (P o = 0.73) to 2.2 at 10 mM cGMP (P o = 0.69).

Run-up in X-chimeras, as in many CNG channels (Molokanova et al., 1997), typically causes a potentiation of cyclic nucleotide activation, including an increase in efficacy (unpublished data). For patches of Construct 3, we noticed that wash-in and wash-out current spikes indicative of bimodal agonism were more prominent in pulses of 10 mM cGMP given early after patch excision compared with later pulses (Fig. 3 B). To quantify con action in individual pulses of 10-mM cGMP perfusion, we compared the P o value at steady state (P steady ) and at the peak of the wash-in spike (P spike ), which corresponds to an interval where cGMP is momentarily near 3 mM (Fig. 1); this avoids reference to the steady-state g (3 mM cGMP) standard, which would not be stable during run-up. In four patches of Construct 3, pulses of 10 mM cGMP were applied less than 5 min after excision (mean P steady = 0.53 \u00b1 0.02) as well as after completion of run-up (P steady = 0.69 \u00b1 0.04). Con action in these four patches was more robustly exhibited before run-up (P steady /P spike = 0.84 \u00b1 0.04) compared with after (P steady /P spike = 0.97 \u00b1 0.03; significantly different than before by paired t test, location of the key \ue061A-\ue0621 region in the fCNGA2 BD using comparative modeling (see Materials and methods) based on the crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment from the related HCN2 channel (Zagotta et al., 2003). Models were built for the C-linker and BD of X-fA2 and Constructs 7 and 8 ( Fig. 4 C); the independently built models were closely superimposable with each other with a small root-mean-squared distance (0.2 \u00c5) for all atoms excluding unconserved residues. In other words, introducing up to seven substitutions to the X-fA2 model did not result in any steric clashes forcing a large shift of nonsubstituted atoms during the energy minimization. The model shows that cGMP bound to the canonical ligand-binding pocket, which is highly conserved in crystal structures of other cyclic nucleotide-activated proteins (Weber and Steitz, 1987;Su et al., 1995;Clayton et al., 2004;Rehmann et al., 2008), does not lie close to the \ue061A-\ue0621 region. However, it remains possible that observably potentiate pro action for either agonist, a quite different effect than that of PB cassette replacement.",

Although there are many BD residues that are not conserved between fCNGA2 and rCNGA4, only one is critical for con action, namely V457 in helix \ue061A of fCNGA2. At least some of the structural determinants of pro and con action operate independently of each other: proaction efficacy can be controlled by substituting the PB cassette sequence without affecting con-action energetics, whereas con action can be enabled or disabled by substitution of the \ue061A-\ue0621 sequence without affecting pro action. We produce an example (Construct 3) where a con-action mechanism operates efficiently, yet its suppressive effects on P o are partially masked as an indirect consequence of efficient pro action.",

We found no con action in any channel that we tested with a V457E mutation, namely X-rA4, Constructs 6-8, and the point mutation in X-fA2 background. We emphasize that \"critical\" means \"necessary\" but does not mean \"sufficient\"; for instance, the presence of valine at position 457 may not ensure the operation of con action in every possible the \ue061A-\ue0621 region contributes to a noncanonical cGMPbinding site. We emphasize that although cGMP concentrations >3 mM are required for con action in constructs like X-fA2 with the fCNGA2 BD, this BD also shows generally weak binding for cAMP, so that the cAMP doseresponse curve does not saturate at 3 mM. Thus, the cGMP affinity of the binding site responsible for con action seems to be comparable to the cAMP affinity of canonical pro-action sites found in the fCNGA2 BD.",

Although a negative environment cannot reliably exclude the binding of phosphate groups (Ledvina et al., 1996), the positive environment around strand \ue0621 would seem an intuitive choice for binding cGMP. For instance, the canonical site has an essential arginine R529 (Tibbs et al., 1998), and strand \ue0621 also contains an arginine R464, which in Construct 8 was neutralized to glutamine. However, we found that an isolated R464Q mutation introduced to X-fA2 did not significantly change the low ratio g (30 mM cGMP) /g (3 mM cGMP) ( Fig. 5 A, X-fA2 R464Q vs. X-fA2). Similarly, an isolated V467T mutation preserved con action and indeed enhanced its observed effects, with a significant decrease in g (30 mM cGMP) /g (3 mM cGMP) compared with that of X-fA2. These results argue against strand \ue0621 contributing to con action at all, and in fact the presence of valine at position 467 in the fCNGA2 BD seems to favor channel opening compared with the threonine found in rCNGA4.",

It may seem odd that these same coupling-control elements could reverse the direction of their effects sequence context, because we did not find con action in Construct 4. We also acknowledge the impossibility of confirming the criticality of V457 in all possible sequence contexts. Thus, conceivably, con action might be restored to X-fA2 V457E by some as yet untested mutations outside position 457. However, any such mutations would have to introduce amino acids not found in the fCNGA2 BD, because X-fA2 V457E currently possesses all fCNGA2 BD residues except V457. (This contrasts with our successful restoration of con action to Construct 4 by adding back noncritical fCNGA2 BD residues to make Construct 5). Our identification of V457 as critical for con action is certainly consistent with known current evidence. Of broader importance, the low pro-action efficacy of X-fA2 V457E (and, more clearly, Construct 8) refutes the sufficiency hypothesis. Thus, con action does not arise as an unavoidable consequence of the rather inefficient pro action in fCNGA2; rather, con action can be removed or added on top of a preexisting pro-action mechanism by virtue of the amino acid at position 457.",

We caution that the effects of PB cassette substitution are expected to depend on the background sequence context, as in any structurefunction study. Unfortunately, the structural effects of PB cassette substitution cannot be reliably explored through our comparative model, because fCNGA2 contains a six-residue insertion in its cassette region with no homologous counterpart in the cassette of HCN2. Further investigations of efficacy determinants may benefit from testing cassettes from different CNG channels, because the insertion is shorter in some CNG family members.",

The persistence of efficient con action in Construct 3 is detectable when this masking is taken into account, refuting the necessity hypothesis. Because low pro-action efficacy is not a prerequisite for the operation of con action, it may be that the con-action mechanism exists in some other previously studied CNG channels but has gone undetected because of masking (see discussion of rat CNGA2 in Biskup et al., 2007, andYoung, 2009).",

Reaction scheme (Chan and Young, 2009) is illustrated by a cell-free inside-out macroscopic patch recording of bimodal CNG channels with cGMP washed into and out from the bath (solid and dashed black bars, respectively). Applying cGMP elicits inward channel current with no desensitization up to 3 mM cGMP, but with 10 mM cGMP, the steady-state macroscopic conductance (white arrow) is smaller than for 3 mM. During wash-in and washout of the 10-mM cGMP solution, there are brief intervals with bath cGMP concentration near 3 mM giving rise to \"spikes\" of maximal conductance. Details of reaction scheme notation: Closed-(C) and open-(O) channel states are equilibrating rapidly compared with agonist wash-in and wash-out. Sizes of black reaction arrows indicate the favored direction of equilibrium. P o increases with cGMP binding of up to m molecules of cGMP (pro action). Binding of the (m+1) th cGMP molecule decreases the steady-state P o (con action) to below the value obtained with m ligands. Experimental details of current trace: The previously characterized channel, X-fA2, incorporates the BD from fCNGA2 channel in a chimera with sequence from other CNG channel types (see Young et al., 2001, and Fig. 2). X-fA2 was expressed as homomers in Xenopus oocytes; patches were held at \ue03240 mV. White arrows mark times where steady-state conductance, g, was measured with cGMP concentrations fixed at their nominal concentrations; for this example, g (10 mM cGMP) /g (3 mM cGMP) = 0.63.",
