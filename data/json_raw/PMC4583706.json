            "text": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most frequently occurring extracranial solid tumors of childhood (Maris et al., 2007 [1]; Brodeur, 2003 [2]). Probability of cure varies according to patient's age, extent of disease and tumor biology (Maris et al., 2007 [1]; Brodeur, 2003 [2]; Cohn et al., 2009 [3]). However, the etiology of this developmental tumor is unknown. Recent evidence has shown that pediatric solid tumors, including NB, harbor a paucity of recurrent genetic mutations, with a significant proportion of recurrent events converging on epigenetic mechanisms (Cheung et al., 2012 [4]; Molenaar et al., 2012 [5]; Pugh et al., 2013 [6]; Sausen et al., 2013 [7]. We have analyzed the DNA methylome of neuroblastoma using high-density microarrays (Infinium Human Methylation 450k BeadChip) to define the epigenetic landscape of this pediatric tumor and its potential clinicopathological impact. Here, we provide the detail of methods and quality control parameters of the microarray data used for the study. Methylation data has been deposited at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus data repository, accession number GSE54719; superseries record GSE54721.",
