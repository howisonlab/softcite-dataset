Lower extremity alignment is one of the paramount factors determining the long-term success of TKA 9-11). A satisfactory alignment can be obtained with the use of a intramedullary or extramedullary alignment guide system. In particular, extramedullary guides are preferred for the tibial side and intramedullary guides are preferred for the femoral side. Unfortunately, the use of an intramedullary guide for the femur has been associated with increased risks of fat embolism, blood loss, postoperative hypoxia, and intraoperative fractures 12-14). Despite the clinical advantages offered by the extramedullary femoral alignment system, it has been employed in limited circumstances to obtain optimal postoperative alignment and avoid technical challenges. However, TKAs using extramedullary femoral alignment guides have been extensively studied in recent years. Kalairajah et al. 15) reported the results of navigation-assisted TKAs and Seo et al. 16) introduced a new extramedullary guide that aligns the femoral component exactly with the coronal, sagittal, and rotational axes.",

Accordingly, continuous efforts have been made to avoid complications associated with allogeneic blood transfusion, The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the extramedullary femoral alignment system is advantageous over the traditional intramedullary system in terms of blood loss and transfusion after TKA. Our hypothesis is that the extramedullary system will result in less blood loss and fewer transfusions.",

In particular, all patients received epidural and spinal anesthesia and the preoperative and postoperative procedures and surgical techniques were identical. Patient-controlled analgesia was implemented postoperatively using a 100 mL mixture of 90 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.5 mg/10 mL fentanyl via an epidural catheter. All operations were performed by the same surgeon (first author) using a medial parapatellar approach introduced by Insall. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was removed and the same PCL-sacrificing prosthesis (Scorpio NRG, Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) was implanted in all knees. The patella was replaced, and the prosthetic components were cemented in all cases. Lateral release was not performed in all patients. Two markers indicating the center of the femoral head and the anterior margin of the greater trochanter were firmly attached to the patient's skin in the EM group prior to surgery so the surgeon could palpate the markers and identify the mechanical axis of the lower limb during surgery. A femoral cutting block was aligned along the coronal and axial axes using new surgical equipment 16) and the two markers. The distal femur was cut without placing a rod into the medullary canal (Fig. 1). The angle between the anatomical axis and the mechanical axis of the femur in the IM group was measured using a PACS system on a preoperative anterioposterior long leg standing radiograph. An intramedullary alignment rod was inserted based on the preoperative measurements, and the distal femur was cut. The entrance hole for the alignment rod in the femoral medullary canal was sealed with bone fragments before inserting the implant. An extramedullary alignment guide was used in both groups for proximal tibial cutting. A drainage tube was placed in the intra-articular space. After wound closure, a compression dressing using gauze and a bandage was applied, and the tourniquet was deflated. Drainage was discontinued from immediately after surgery until 2 hours after tourniquet deflation. All drains were removed 24 hours after surgery. Blood transfusion was performed when hemoglobin was <8 g/dL or when dyspnea, palpitation, dizziness, or abnormal vital signs were noted even if the hemoglobin was 8-10 g/dL. Rivaroxaban, an oral anticoagulant, was administered from immediately after the drain removal until the postoperative week 2 to prevent thromboembolic disorders. The anticoagulant was discontinued if hemarthrosis due to intra-articular bleeding was present or effusion from the surgical wound continued. Tests for thromboembolic disorders were not performed unless clinical symptoms appeared.",

            "text": "In this study, the EM group had more favorable results than those in the IM group in terms of blood savings. The mean drained volume via the vacuum drainage was smaller in the EM group, hemoglobin at 5 days after surgery was higher, the hemoglobin drop was smaller, and the prevalence of allogeneic transfusion was lower. These results are congruent with the hypothesis that the extramedullary alignment guide system reduces blood loss and transfusion rate. In this study, we measured blood volume drained via vacuum drainage and the hemoglobin but did not calculate the blood loss based on some reports 22,23) in which the measured blood loss reflects calculated blood loss. The extramedullary alignment guide system and intramedullary alignment guide system have been compared in terms of blood loss in many studies. In 2005, Kalairajah et al. 15) reported that mean blood drainage volume was significantly smaller in the group in which a computer-assisted technique was used compared to that in the control group (1,351 mL vs. 1,747 mL). In 2006, Kandel et al. 14) documented that mean blood drainage volume was significantly lower in a extramedullary guide system group compared to that in a intramedullary guide system group (613 mL vs. 758 mL), and transfusion volume appeared to be less in the former group. Our results were comparable with those of other studies 14,15,24,25) that showed blood loss could be reduced by 145-396 mL when the medullary canal was not breached during TKA. Although the frequency Values are presented as means with standard deviations in parentheses except allogeneic blood transfusion, for which values are presented as percents and numbers (in parentheses) of patients who had the conditions. of transfusion was lower in the EM group in our study, it was still higher compared to some recent studies 4,6) . We attributed this to the broad indications for transfusion we set in this study; a blood transfusion was performed when hemoglobin was <8 g/dL or when dyspnea, palpitation, dizziness, or abnormal vital signs were noted, even if the hemoglobin was 8-10 g/dL. In addition, prophylactic transfusions that were carried out considering the patient's history of illness were counted in the transfusion rate calculation. However, when these prophylactic cases (5 in the IM group and 2 in the EM group) were not counted as transfusions, the frequency decreased to 37.1% (13 in 35 patients) in the IM group and 16.2% (6 in 37 patients) in the EM group. Furthermore, if a higher transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL hemoglobin was set, the frequency would have declined to 27.5% (11 in 40 patients) in the IM group and to 5.1% (2 in 39 patients) in the EM group. A limitation of this study was the lack of diversity in the study population. We think that it would be difficult to extrapolate our findings to other patient groups, considering that our data were obtained only from female patients with a diagnosis of degenerative arthritis. Additionally, we did not assess intergroup differences regarding fat embolisms or postoperative complications, including hypoxia, pain, or lower limb alignment accuracy.",

It has not been clearly elucidated which system is more advantageous over the other regarding component alignment accuracy. However, some recent studies have introduced techniques to improve the accuracy of the extramedullary alignment guide system 16,[27][28][29][30] . Therefore, we believe that the extramedullary alignment guide system could be useful for decreasing blood loss and transfusion frequency during TKA unless it is inferior to the intramedullary system in terms of component alignment accuracy.",
