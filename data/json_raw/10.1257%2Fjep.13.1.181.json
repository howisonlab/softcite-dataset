These developments in economic thinking, often associated with the Chicago school, led current antitrust law and practice toward a greater skepticism about the relationship between market concentration and market power and a greater recognition of the possible efficiency-enhancing role of vertical agreements (contracts between firms and their customers or suppliers) than was present in the 1950s and 1960s. 1 This survey will begin where those developments leave off by highlighting more recent developments in antitrust economics that have influenced the way the federal antitrust enforcement agencies analyze five issues: efficiencies from mergers, entry conditions, practices facilitating coordination, exclusionary practices, and the unilateral competitive effects of mergers.",

(In a dynamic context, the merger guidelines are also concerned with the possibility that firms could exercise market power by slowing innovation, or the possibility that the efficiencies from merger could generate product improvements.) An acquisition's net effect on price in any market depends on which effect dominates. It is quite possible to have both a gain in productive efficiency (cheaper production) along with a loss in allocative efficiency resulting from greater market power. The merger guidelines focus on price, and thus emphasize identifying the net effect of the merger on consumer's surplus within the markets where anticompetitive harm appears possible. Under some circumstances, there is flexibility for the enforcement agencies to take into account production efficiencies that are generated in other markets or that do not appear likely to be passed on to consumers.",

The lower the pass-through rate, the greater must be any marginal cost reductions to overcome an anticompetitive incentive to raise price and generate a price reduction on net. 2 Because the federal enforcement agencies consider only those efficiencies that are merger-specific-that is, efficiencies from the proposed merger unlikely to be achieved (or to be achieved as rapidly) absent the merger-and because mergerspecific efficiencies typically lead to firm-specific cost savings (that do not diffuse to the rest of the industry), the relevant pass-through rate for evaluating mergers is usually firm-specific. A firm-specific pass-through rate relates a change in the price a firm charges for a product to a change in the marginal cost of that product, holding constant the marginal cost of rivals' products. The firm-specific passthrough rate is likely to be lower than the rate at which industry-wide cost changes are passed through to prices. Indeed, in the special case where a competitor is a price-taker, the firm will not alter price at all in response to firm-specific costs change though it will do so when industry-wide costs are affected. 3 The distinction between firm-specific and industry-wide pass-through rates became important in the Federal Trade Commission's recent court challenge to the proposed merger of Staples and Office Depot (Ashenfelter, Ashmore, Baker and McKernan, 1998). The empirical results presented by one FTC expert witness, Orley Ashenfelter, showed that Staples' firm-specific pass-through rate was only 15 percent; much lower than the industry-wide rate. If so, the merger would lead to higher prices unless merger-specific efficiencies generated marginal cost reductions at least six or seven times the magnitude of the price increase that would otherwise occur.",

Recent developments in economic theory have helped clarify the significance of sunk expenditures in determining when this would occur. If the fixed costs of entry are not sunk, and entrants have variable costs comparable to incumbents, the market is ''contestable'' and performs competitively regardless of market concentration among incumbent sellers (Baumol, Panzar and Willig, 1982). But if entry requires sunk expenditures, and incumbents would be expected to react quickly to cut price in response to entry, entry may be deterred even if the pre-entry price exceeds competitive levels. This may occur because the prospective entrant, recognizing the prospect of postentry competition, will not expect to earn a contribution margin adequate to cover its sunk costs (Schwartz and Reynolds, 1983).",

This question recognizes that if the entrant must operate at an output level too large for the market to absorb without depressing prices further, or if incumbents would keep the new producer from achieving the necessary output level by expanding sales in response to entry, then new competition sufficient to solve the competitive problem from merger would not be forthcoming. The guidelines test the entrant's profitability at pre-merger prices, notwithstanding the price increase expected as a result of an anticompetitive merger, because entry will solve the competitive problem only if it returns the market price to pre-merger levels. Hence, the potential entrants relevant for merger analysis-namely, those whose entry would solve the feared competitive problem-will evaluate the profitability of entry based on a forecast that price will be at the pre-merger level.",

Stigler questioned the inevitability of noncompetitive oligopoly behavior by highlighting the need for oligopolists to identify a consensus and to deter deviation from it, thus raising the sort of informational and dynamic issues that have become central to contemporary oligopoly theory. For example, he observed that when firms make inferences about the strategies of rivals from changes in their own market share, an industry participant's ability to cut price without detection by rivals, and thus its incentive to do so, increases as the market grows less concentrated.",

Coordination refers to any equilibria in which firms adopt, with or without discussion or communication with their rivals, strategies that recognize that they have interacted in the past and will continue to do so in the future.) The resulting focus on the presence or absence of factors facilitating coordinated outcomes became particularly influential in merger analysis at the federal enforcement agencies following the promulgation of the 1982 Department of Justice Merger Guidelines.",

Stigler had highlighted the difficulties of sustaining coordination with a focus on a one-shot prisoner's dilemma game, pointing out the difficulties firms face in achieving consensus and deterring deviation from it. But as has become well-known, in an infinitely repeated game-even the prisoner's dilemma-coordinated outcomes (often including the repeated play of the cooperative outcome of the one-shot prisoner's dilemma) can readily be sustained. This result is broadly known as the ''folk theorem,'' and it suggests that deterring defection may not be as difficult as it appeared to Stigler. For example, Green and Porter (1984) showed that while uncertainty about whether rivals are cheating on the cartel consensus may lead to occasional price wars, it does not necessarily undermine the possibility of substantial periods of coordination. Moreover, the other Stiglerian cartel problem, of identifying an oligopolistic consensus, appears less daunting when firms have the opportunity to engage in ''cheap talk''-in the sense that term is used in Farrell and Rabin (1996)-as by announcing (indeed, negotiating) proposed price increases in the business press, without commitment, before they are implemented.",

Even when the number of firms is small, coordination among sellers may be unsustainable if buyers adopt large, widely spaced and randomly timed procurements, for example. Accordingly, a task force reviewing antitrust aspects of defense industry consolidation recommended that the Defense Department schedule its purchases in such a way as to reduce the risks of coordinated interaction by sellers (Defense Science Board Task Force, 1994).",

DOJ alleged that the leading U.S. air carriers employed a computer system run by an airline joint venture to fix prices. The computer system collected each airline's actual and proposed price changes and sent them to computerized reservation systems used by travel agents. The computer also processed the price information and gave the airlines detailed reports that were unavailable to users of computerized reservations systems. According to Justice, the airlines used those detailed reports effectively to conduct negotiations, creating a language using fare relationships and footnote designators. They allegedly reached complex bargains across markets, such as trades where one carrier offered to increase fares on a route into a rival's hub in exchange for the rival's assenting to increase fares on a route into the first carrier's hub. The consent order prevents the airlines from using footnote designators and other methods to engage in costless quasi-public negotiations about price levels. These issues extend beyond airlines: the Federal Communications Commission recently altered its rules governing spectrum auctions to require bidding in round numbers, as a means of preventing bidders from costlessly communicating (and potentially coordinating) using the ''trailing digits'' in their bids.",

Early 20th century antitrust litigation involving Alcoa, for example, arose in part out of that firm's efforts to deny potential rivals in aluminum production access to low cost electric power. Enforcement interest in exclusionary conduct waned as courts recognized that conduct that excludes rivals can also promote competitionas when a deal for exclusive distribution discourages dealer free-riding on manufacturer promotional efforts. However, recent economic research, often relying on gametheoretic modeling techniques, has clarified the logic by which exclusionary practices can harm competition, and thus brought a resurgence of interest in the ways firms can achieve market power by raising rivals' costs or through other non-price exclusionary conduct (Salop and Scheffman, 1987;Ordover, Saloner and Salop, 1990;Rasmusen, Ramseyer and Wiley, 1991;Bernheim and Whinston, 1998).",

Suppose, for example, firms A and B would like to collude with rival C, their only actual or potential competitor in a market protected from entry, but they cannot do so because C would increase output (or enter) were A and B to raise price. If A could somehow raise C's marginal costs or otherwise make it more difficult for C to sell more, then C would be led to do what it would not have done previously: reduce its output. A might be able to accomplish this end by foreclosing C from access to low cost sources of supply or distribution, perhaps through exclusive contracts, or by making it more difficult for C to attract customers, perhaps by tying sales of its products together. Then, A and B could take advantage of the less aggressive competition from C to exercise market power.",

Firm B may not go along with A in reducing output once C is taken out of the picture. The strategy may be unprofitable for A given that it must bear the full costs of excluding C while sharing with firm B the benefit of any higher prices that result. Moreover, A's strategy may both disadvantage C and increase aggregate economic welfare. For example, a manufacturer may foreclose rivals from effective distribution by requiring the dealer not to handle the products of rival manufacturers, but the same practice may also lead the manufacturer to increase its promotional effort, reduce dealer free-riding, and result in better service to customers. Notwithstanding these caveats, it should be clear that it is possible for exclusionary deals with suppliers, distributors, or customers to impair horizontal rivalry and reduce aggregate surplus.",

The FTC recently found that Toys R Us convinced toymakers not to provide certain merchandise to warehouse club stores, thereby reducing retailing competition from an alternative distribution channel. (The toy retailer's defense is in part that it was acting to prevent free-riding by rival dealers on its investments in promoting toys and the firm is likely to appeal.) The FTC's 1997 consent settlement with Time Warner resolving a complaint arising from its acquisition of Turner Broadcasting sought to address (among other things) concerns that Time Warner might have been able to reduce the competition facing its company-owned cable television systems by raising the price of CNN and other programming to satellite providers of broadcast video. Similarly, in several recent enforcement actions involving health care providers, the Department of Justice has challenged health insurance plans with high market shares that adopted ''mostfavored-customer'' provisions, which require affiliated dentists or other providers not to accept lower reimbursement rates from any other insurance plans they also join. Justice was concerned that such provisions would discourage entry by lowercost rival insurance plans, by making it difficult for those rivals to convince providers to join their networks. 5 The Justice Department's 1995 consent decree with Microsoft also addressed practices that allegedly harm competition by raising rivals' costs. A key provision prevents Microsoft from receiving royalties from computer manufacturers on a perprocessor basis, regardless of whether Microsoft's Windows operating system was installed on those machines. Under this provision, a firm effectively pays twice for the operating system if it installs an operating system owned by a Microsoft rivalonce to the rival and once to Microsoft-but it pays only once for a computer with Microsoft's operating system installed. Gilbert and Shapiro (1997) characterize this provision as a ''penalty clause.'' It raises the costs for firms with rival operating systems seeking to induce computer manufacturers to adopt a competing operating system for some product lines, and could thus protect Microsoft's alleged monopoly power in operating systems.",

Protecting incentives for innovation is a common recent theme at the antitrust enforcement agencies. Another example occurred when two pharmaceutical producers, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, sought to merge in 1996. The FTC obtained a consent settlement requiring the merged firm (Novartis) to sell off one of the competing research and development efforts in genetic engineering to a third firm to protect competition in innovation. Moreover, in a new round of Microsoft litigation, the Justice Department is currently asking a court to determine whether Microsoft's integration of Internet browser software into Windows harms innovation and tends to create or maintain monopoly by excluding rivals selling browsers such as Netscape (DOJ's view), or promotes innovation and competition by improving software design (Microsoft's position). 6 The widely discussed possibility of network externalities-the benefit that users obtain when other customers use the same product, as with much computer software-raises the stakes for antitrust enforcers in discriminating between harmful and beneficial exclusionary practices. 7 The possibility of network effects increases the efficiency benefits of having a single standard in the marketplace, but it may also entrench a firm and so allow it to exercise market power in a more damaging way. In consequence, antitrust enforcement decisions may be ineffective unless they are made early in an industry's development, before a standard becomes so secure as to make an antitrust remedy impractical. Yet it may be hard to make reliable judgments before uncertainties about the consequences of the challenged conduct have been fully resolved in the marketplace.",

Instead of focusing on how a merger could make coordination more likely or more effective, the unilateral theories describe how a merger would make it profitable for the merged firm to raise price without assuming repeated play, as by taking rivals' reactions as given. 8 Two developments in economics spurred the recent interest in unilateral theories. The first was a theoretical literature that investigated the conditions under which oligopolists would find merger profitable even if the industry members were not coordinating their actions, but were instead taking each other's output or price as given, consistent with Cournot-Nash or Bertrand-Nash solution concepts (Salant, Switzer and Reynolds, 1983;Deneckere and Davidson, 1985;Perry and Porter, 1985;Farrell and Shapiro, 1990). The second was an empirical literature encouraged by the simultaneous development of new econometric tools and computerized pointof-sale scanner data (Baker and Bresnahan, 1985;Berry and Pakes, 1993;Hausman, Leonard and Zona, 1994;Werden and Froeb, 1994;Baker, 1997a). These tools and data can make it possible to identify the extent to which buyers consider individual products to be close substitutes; the extent to which, in consequence, individual products constrain the pricing of rivals; and the extent to which mergers encourage higher prices by removing those constraints. The 1992 revisions to the DOJ and FTC Horizontal Merger Guidelines recognize these economic developments by describing several ways in which a merger can lessen competition through unilateral effects; see also Willig (1991).",

A merger between the firms would provide an incentive to increase the price of the Crunchy brand. Before the merger, a higher Crunchy price would lead to some loss of sales to the Fruity firm. But if the Crunchy firm acquires the Fruity firm, then it will recapture some of the contribution to profit on the lost Crunchy sales through an increase in Fruity sales. Accordingly, the merger removes Fruity as a competitive constraint on Crunchy pricing. This problem is the most serious if the Fruity and Crunchy brands are the closest substitutes for each other, but that is not necessary for competitive harm to occur. The merged firm has some unilateral incentive to raise the Crunchy price even if most of the lost sales go to brands other than Fruity-as long as some of the lost sales go to Fruity. Moreover, the merger could lead to higher prices even if the merging firms account for small shares of the breakfast cereals category.",

Under such circumstances, the traditional practice of not challenging mergers among firms with low market shares (memorialized in ''safe harbors'' based on market concentration in the Merger Guidelines) may be undermined.

Today, a case-by-case analysis is more common, often under the judicial rubric of applying the ''rule of reason.'' For example, in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that maximum resale price maintenance (a practice by which a manufacturer capped dealer resale prices) would no longer be considered illegal per se. Similarly, at one time any attempt among sellers of substitutes to engage in price-fixing or market division was universally condemned; today, these practices could be allowed if they are necessary to create a valuable new product, as when separately owned teams create a sports league and set prices jointly or when separately owned moving companies in different cities adopt a common brand name. Moreover, antitrust enforcers and courts have shifted from relying primarily on market share evidence to predicting the competitive consequences of business practices; today, market definition and market shares are increasingly treated as merely one element in a detailed economic analysis of the consequences of the particular conduct at issue.",

The FTC's successful challenge to the Staples/Office Depot merger, for example, might have come out differently under the old approach. The government's case was probably weakest in the market definition question (in showing that office superstores were a relevant product market excluding other channels for the distribution of office supplies) and strongest in offering direct evidence (documentary and econometric) that the merger would probably lead to higher prices for consumers. However, better analysis of individual cases may come at the expense of reducing the clarity of legal rules and the certainty of their application, which affects both judges evaluating antitrust claims and firms wondering whether a proposed course of conduct would violate the antitrust laws. The increased reliance on case-specific economic analysis may also add to the cost and time involved in investigating and litigating cases. However this tradeoff is resolved-that is, regardless of whether economic models are used to design ''per se'' rules or to provide insights to guide the evaluation of case-specific evidence-economic analysis remains central to antitrust practice.",

Antitrust enforcers and courts have as yet made little use of these models, though they occasionally arise in merger enforcement.
