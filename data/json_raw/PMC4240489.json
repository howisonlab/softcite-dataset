            "text": "Objectives. Premedication with clonidine has been found to reduce the bleeding during endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), therefore lowering the risk of surgical complications. Premedication is an essential part of pre-surgical care and can potentially affect magnitude of systemic stress response to a surgical procedure. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of premedication with clonidine and midazolam in patients undergoing sinus surgery. Methods. Forty-four patients undergoing ESS for chronic sinusitis and polyp removal were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either oral clonidine or midazolam as a premedication before receiving propofol/remifentanil total intravenous anesthesia. The effect of this premedication choice on anesthetic requirements, intraoperative hemodynamic profile, preoperative anxiety and sedation as well as postoperative pain and shivering were examined in each premedication group. Results. Total intraoperative remifentanil requirement was lower in the clonidine group as compared to the midazolam group 503.2\u00b1147.0 \u00b5g vs. 784.5\u00b1283.8 \u00b5g, respectively (P<0.001). There was no difference between groups in required induction dose of propofol, level of preoperative anxiety, level of sedation and postoperative shivering. Intraoperative systemic blood pressure and heart rate response had a more favorable profile in patients premedicated with clonidine. Postoperative pain assessed by visual analogue scale for pain was lower in the clonidine group compared with to the midazolam premedication group. Conclusion. Premedication with clonidine provides better attenuation of hemodynamic response and reduction of intraoperative remifentanil requirements in patients undergoing ESS. Postoperative pain seems to be better controlled after clonidine premedication as well."

Alpha-2 agonists have been shown to have beneficial analgesic, sedative [6,11,12] and opioid sparing effects [13]. In animal studies clonidine and dexmedetomidine were reported to reduce the minimal alveolar concentration for halothane by nearly 50% and 90%, respectively [14,15]. The anesthetic and analgesic sparing effects is most likely related to the direct action on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system [16,17] and is evident for volatile and intravenous anesthetics. Ghignone et al. [5] showed a 45% reduction in requirements for analgesics during the intraoperative period after clonidine premedication compared to standard premedication in patients undergoing bypass surgery. Flacke et al. [18] demonstrated reduced sufentanil requirement by 40% while improving hemodynamic profile during coronary artery bypass graft as well. Interestingly Frank et al. [19], similarly to our investigation, demonstrated a reduction in cumulative remifentanil dose by 24% after clonidine premedication in patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery under TIVA.",

In clinically relevant doses, preoperative use of clonidine is not associated with a risk of respiratory depression, which may be of particular importance in patients undergoing procedures on upper airways [6]. Also because clonidine stimulates not only the alpha 2 receptor but alpha 1 receptors as well, it does not inhibit the baroreceptor reflex, but only reduces its sensitivity, which prevents the significant decrease in blood pressure [6]. This is of particular importance in same day surgery patients as postoperative hypotension may delay discharge.",

Interestingly 5 patients in the midazolam group (vs. none in clonidine group) required administration of an additional agent (urapidil) to treat intraoperative hypertension, this suggests that premedication with clonidine provides much better control of the hemodynamic response to the stress of surgery intraoperatively.",
