            "text": "Sorafenib has been recommended as first-or second-line treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) by several guidelines. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib monotherapy in Chinese patients with mRCC and determine the prognostic clinicopathologic factors associated with survival in these patients. This is a single-arm retrospective study conducted in 2 tertiary medical centers; 140 mRCC patients were enrolled between January 2007 and June 2014. Sorafenib was administered at a dose of 400 mg twice daily, and continued until disease progression, at which point the dose was increased to 600 or 800 mg twice daily, or the onset of an intolerable adverse drug event (ADE) that required dose reduction or temporary suspension of treatment. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. The median follow-up time was 32 months. The median OS and PFS were 24 months (range, 3-88 months) and 16 months (range, 0-88 months), respectively. Patients with clear cell carcinoma had a greater OS (P \u00bc 0.001) whereas sarcomatoid differentiation (P \u00bc 0.045) and disease progression (P \u00bc 0.010) negatively impacted OS; time from kidney surgery or biopsy to initiation of sorafenib treatment was associated with PFS (P \u00bc 0.027). Efficacy analysis revealed that 3 (2.1%) patients achieved complete responses, 28 (20.0%) patients experienced partial responses, 88 (62.9%) patients had stable disease, and 21 (15.0%) patients developed progressive disease. Moreover, the ORR was 22.1%, and the DCR was 85.0%. Most ADEs were classified as grades 1 or 2 with only 14 (10.0%) patients experiencing a severe ADE (grade 3). Sorafenib monotherapy can achieve promising OS and PFS for Chinese patients with mRCC, especially in those with clear cell carcinoma, with manageable adverse events.",

            "text": "R enal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for nearly 3% of all adult malignancies, and its incidence is increasing in China. 1,2 The poor prognosis of these patients is due in part to its late detection; approximately one-third of patients are diagnosed with metastatic RCC (mRCC) at first presentation. 3 In addition, although surgery is the most effective treatment, approximately 20% to 40% of patients experience distant metastasis or local recurrence after primary nephrectomy 4 with a 5-year survival rate of <10%. 5 Furthermore, mRCC is highly resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy; therefore, immunotherapy had been the main treatment option for these patients. However, low tumor response and high toxicities limit this treatment option to only a select few patients. 6,7 Surgical resection of mRCC at multiple sites also improves long-term survival, but it is not always technically feasible. 8 The advent of targeted therapy that inhibit specific signaling pathways important for tumor growth and metastasis, including the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway, 9 has changed the treatment paradigms of mRCC. Since the use of the first VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, the treatment algorithm of mRCC has dramatically changed. Sorafenib (Nexavar, Bayer Pharmaceuticals, West Haven, Conn and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Emeryville, Calif) is another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, targeting the VEGF receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, Raf kinase 1, KIT, and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3. [10][11][12] Previous studies have shown that sorafenib improves progression-free survival (PFS) in mRCC by 2.7 months 11 as well as overall survival (OS) 13 ; therefore, it has been recommended by several guidelines, including those of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, as a second-line treatment option for those who failed prior immunotherapy. 14 However, its efficacy in Chinese patients is not fully known. Therefore, this retrospective study analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of 140 patients with mRCC who were treated with sorafenib at 2 large-volume centers in China to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sorafenib and identify any prognostic factors related to the efficacy of sorafenib.",

This theory is supported by similar findings in Japanese 22,23 and Korean 24 patients with advanced RCC. However, as shown in a recently published systemic review, the median OS and PFS for sorafenib-treated mRCC patients in Western countries varies. 25 For example, the TIVO trial 26 reported a median OS of 29.3 months, which is similar to the OS in the present study (24 months). Alternatively, the greater proportion of patients receiving dose escalation in this study may have contributed to better OS as dose escalation therapy may prove superior over therapy discontinuation in the case of disease progression. 15,27,28 Therefore, further investigations are needed to determine if there are truly significantly different prognoses for various ethnic groups as well as to investigate the effects of documented tumor marker differences and varying molecular characteristics in different ethnic groups in order to select the best candidates for different targeted drugs.",

In the present study, 3 independent factors were identified that impacted the survival of mRCC patients treated with sorafenib. First, clear cell carcinoma appeared to offer a benefit to OS of 14 months, which was similar to previous studies in which nonclear cell histology was an adverse prognostic factor for predicting OS. 30,31 In addition, we found that sarcomatoid differentiation and PD negatively impacted OS, and the time from kidney surgery or biopsy to initiation of sorafenib treatment may be associated with PFS. Although the association of tumor sarcomatoid differentiation with poor prognosis was consistent with the previous reports, [32][33][34] this result should not be overinterpreted considering the small sample of patients with sarcomatoid differentiation (9 out of 140 patients).

However, the ADEs were manageable in that most were mild or moderate. Only 14 (10.0%) patients experienced severe, 19 grade 3 ADEs. Several previous studies have explored the correlation between ADEs and efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and suggest that the incidence of ADEs (even high-grade ADEs) may indicate better outcome. [37][38][39] DiFiore et al 40 suggested that severe clinical toxicities or grades 3 and 4 ADEs may result in better prognosis, with a median OS benefit of 24 months as compared to those without grades 3 and 4 ADEs. In contrast, ADEs were not associated with a longer OS in the present study, which may be because of differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters between ethnic groups.  ) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Leukocytopenia 137 (97.9%) 3 (2.1%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Elevation of ALT 133 (95.0%) 5 (3.6%) 2 (1.4%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Elevation of uric acid 136 (97.1%) 4 (2.9%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Hoarseness 138 (98.6%) 2 (1.4%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Arthralgia 136 (97.1%) 3 (2.1%) 1 (0.7%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%)",
