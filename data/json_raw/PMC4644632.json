Annexins are a prominent group of such markers and annexin A2 (AnxA2) is one of the best characterized annexins. AnxA2 inhibits HBV polymerase among other functions. Its expression is up-regulated in regenerative hepatocytes. Objectives: To determine if serum AnxA2 level has a role in estimating liver damage in chronic HBV infection and investigate whether AnxA2 levels correlate with hepatic fibrosis. Patients and Methods: This study included 173 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 51 healthy controls. Liver fibrosis was graded histologically on liver biopsy samples. Blood samples were taken from patients during biopsy and serum AnxA2 levels were measured with ELISA. Results: In a group of adult patients with CHB, AnxA2 values were far higher than those of the control group (P = 0.001). When we assessed AnxA2 levels based on fibrosis stages, serum AnxA2 levels of patients with early stage fibrosis (stages 1-3) were significantly higher than those of patients with advanced stage fibrosis (stages 4-5; P = 0.001). Conclusions: AnxA2 is a useful biomarker for early stage fibrosis in patients with CHB.",

It was postulated that AnxA2 could be used as a noninvasive marker for diagnosis of HBV-related liver fibrosis. Moreover, we and others have shown that age and gender did not affect serum AnxA2 levels (13). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating serum AnxA2 levels in CHB patients. In our study, AnxA2 levels of CHB patients were significantly higher than those of control group, reflecting ongoing hepatocyte injury through the course of CHB disease. Furthermore, we examined whether serum AnxA2 levels could be implemented as a tool for noninvasive liver fibrosis measurement. Serum AnxA2 levels of patients with early stage fibrosis (stages 1, 2, and 3) were significantly higher than serum AnxA2 levels of patients with advanced stage fibrosis (stages 4 and 5; Figure 1 B). Zhang et al. (12) previously showed in an animal model that AnxA2 expression was elevated in advanced cirrhosis compared to early liver damage. They could not demonstrate that plasma AnxA2 levels differed between early and advanced stages of fibrosis. We speculate that AnxA2 may be overexpressed in the liver without elevating serum AnxA2. Since hepatocytes are the main source of AnxA2, decreased serum AnxA2 levels may reflect a diminished hepatocyte reservoir at advanced fibrosis stages. Elevated AnxA2 levels could also result from denovo liver carcinogenesis. In this study, we tried to rule out possible underlying HCC by excluding patients with elevated AFP levels or ultrasound abnormalities. That is why we think our results were not biased by underlying HCC. Furthermore, to our knowledge, none of our patients developed cancer until the year 2015.",

Future studies designed to analyze larger cohorts prospectively could improve the evidence for AnxA2 as a clinical biomarker for hepatic fibrosis. Because we could not identify the source of AnxA2 in this study, it is not easy to speculate regarding abnormal AnxA2 levels. AnxA2 is not liver-specific and its level may increase in the presence of concomitant inflammatory conditions. In addition, its serum level depends on its clearance rate, which may be influenced by some cofounders such as dysfunction of endothelial cells, impaired biliary excretion or renal function, ethnicity and body mass index (12), which were not focused in the study.",
