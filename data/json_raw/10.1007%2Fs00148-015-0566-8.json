For instance, The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that approximately 50 % of fathers and mothers in state prison had at least one other family member that had also been incarcerated: 6 % had an incarcerated mother, 19 % had an incarcerated father, 34 % had an incarcerated brother, 7 % had an incarcerated sister, 2 % had an incarcerated child, and 2 % had an incarcerated spouse (Glaze and Maruschak 2008). What is it about these individuals that cause them to engage in similar antisocial behaviors? Answering this question and identifying the relative contribution of different family and community factors to criminal behavior is crucial in our quest to both identify the fundamental causes of criminal behavior and to develop public policies to combat crime.",

            "text": "Thus, the aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the importance of family background and neighborhood effects as determinants of crime. We do this in two ways. We first quantify the role of family and community background for criminal activity by estimating sibling correlations in criminal convictions and incarceration. Siblings share (among other things) genes, parents, family values, and common influences from peers and neighborhoods. The sibling correlation, therefore, provides us with a broad measure of the importance of family and community factors. It tells us what share of the variation in criminal behavior can be traced back to common influences stemming from family and community background. We then run an accounting exercise to see the extent to which a large set of family-wide variables (parental income and education, parental criminality, family structure, and neighborhoods) can account for the sibling correlations in criminal behavior that we report. While a literature studying sibling correlations in crime certainly exists, as does a literature studying the importance of family and community background effects on crime, 1 we are aware of little research that has combined these two strands of literature to assess the extent to which various family-wide control variables can account for sibling similarities in crime. 2 Sibling correlations in criminal behavior have been documented in a number of contexts: varying countries, different types of sibling pairs, administrative versus survey data, various crime types, and different measures of criminality. These estimates range from a low of 0.25 (Mazumder 2008) to a high of 0.69 (Johnson 2007). 3 Twin studies also report strong sibling similarities in antisocial behavior and crime. 4 Many of these studies, however, use data from small, selected samples, while studies using data from the NLSY or PSID rely on self-reported data covering a limited time period. Frisell et al. (2011) is an important exception. Their study reports (perhaps for the first time) population-wide sibling correlations using police register data in Sweden, albeit only for violent crime at the extensive margin. They find an extensive margin correlation of 0.41 for brothers and 0.48 for sisters.",

We also see similar patterns for sibling correlations after breaking down the data by crime type (violent, property, and other) and no systematic difference between brother correlations and sister correlations.

The main difference is that parents are much older when we observe them in our crime data. We also have data on parental education and income, as well as family structure when our siblings are young. Siblings can be placed into the neighborhoods they were raised in as children based on their parish of residence. More detailed information concerning parent and neighborhood variables are presented in Sections 5. Table 1 shows the number of families having N children and Table 2 presents descriptive statistics. Our final sample consists of 707,613 individuals (363,234 men and 344,379 women) from 414,697 families. The mean number of siblings in each family is 1.7. In our sample, 29 % of the individuals are singletons (i.e., they have no are labeled as \"other.\" The five most common violent crimes are (in order of frequency) assault, molestation, unlawful threat, aggravated assault, and aggravated unlawful threat. The five most common property crimes are petty theft (mainly shoplifting), theft, vandalism, larceny, and fraud. The five most common \"other\" crimes are dangerous driving, driving without a license, unlawful driving, smuggling, and minor narcotic offenses. 16 Thus, if you steal a car, then commit an armed robbery and then get caught after a high-speed chase, you will have one trial and one sentence that include convictions for at least three crime types. In this case, the individual would receive violent = 1 (armed robbery), property = 1 (car theft), and other = 1 (serious traffic offense + resisting arrest). All children of the same mother are defined as belonging to the same family siblings in the sample). We include singletons to increase the precision of the estimate of the between-family variation, though our results are not sensitive to their inclusion/exclusion. Turning to the measures of criminal behavior, 28.5 % of the sample individuals have been convicted of a crime. Criminal convictions are 3.5 times more common among men than women; 43.7 % of men and 12.5 % of women have been convicted of a crime. For both men and women, violent crimes are least frequent while other crimes are most frequent. Only 5.5 % of the individuals have been convicted of a violent crime, while 13.7 % have been convicted of a property crime and 22.5 % of some other crime. 17 Among the individuals convicted of a crime, the average number of crimes is 6.8. This number is 7.7 for men and 3.8 for women. Among the individuals convicted of a violent crime, the average number of violent crimes is 2.7. The corresponding number is 4.4 for other crimes and 5.9 for property crimes. Thus, given that an individual has been convicted of a crime of a specific type, the intensive margin frequency of that crime type is highest for property crimes and lowest for violent crimes. This pattern applies to both men and women. 4.4 % of the individuals have been sentenced to prison. Prison sentences are 11.1 times more common among men than among women; 7.8 % of the men compared to only 0.7 % of the women have been sentenced to prison. For an individual sentenced to prison, the average prison sentence (summed over all prison sentences) is 455 days, 463 days for men and 367 for women.

The correlation for all siblings is thus substantially higher for property crimes and violent crimes than for other crimes, and higher for prison than for all crime outcomes. That is, shared family and community factors appear to explain more of the variation in serious crime than minor crime. This pattern also applies to the brother and sister correlations. The brother correlations are slightly higher than the sister correlations for crime (0.29 versus 0.24), property crime (0.38 versus 0.34), and other crime (0.24 versus 0.21). For violent crime, the brother and sister correlations are the same (0.37), and for prison, the brother correlation is lower than the sister correlation (0.39 versus 0.44). The sister correlation in prison, which is the highest of all extensive margin sibling correlations, suggests that 44 % of the variation in female incarceration at the extensive margin can be accounted for by family and community factors shared by sisters. 20 ",

It is responsible for between 33 and 57 % of the variation in crime at the intensive margin, depending on crime type, the number of crimes committed, and gender. This conclusion is also supported by the findings that (i) the extensive margin correlations for property and violent crimes, which tend to contain more relatively serious offenses, were greater than those for other crimes and (ii) the extensive margin incarceration correlation was stronger than that for convictions, as having any incarceration spells can be seen as a proxy for the severity of criminality since more severe crimes or more convictions (concurrently or in the past) are more likely to result in an incarceration spell.  Thus, while family and community background are important determinants of whether an individual begins a criminal career, they appear to be even more important determinants of the intensity (severity and length) of that criminal career. This naturally leads to the question of why? One possible explanation is social interactions or peer effects within a family: each sibling's criminal behavior reinforces the criminal behavior of the other. 22 Alternatively, different risk factors may cluster within families or be strongly correlated over time. Parental attitudes, parenting strategies, and family resources (broadly defined) may also affect how successful parents are at correcting episodes of deviant behavior that many teenagers experience.",

At the extensive margin, we see that the share of the variation in crime explained by common family background is similar for those born within 4 years of each other and those born 4 to 6 years apart; given that a majority of siblings in the sample are within 6 years of each other, these estimates also correspond to our baseline estimates for the full sample. In contrast, the share of variation in crime explained by common family background is lower for those born more than 6 years apart. This is particularly true for sisters born more than 8 years apart. 23 Two patterns emerge at the intensive margin. First, for all siblings, regardless of how far apart they are in age, the same upward trend in the correlation is seen as the number of crimes studied increases. Second, the intensive margin correlations monotonically decreases as the sibling spacing increases: this is true regardless of which intensive margin is being studied (i.e., at least two offenses, at least three offenses, etc.).",

This can be true even if siblings grow up with their biological parents in an intact family, as, for instance, they may experience the same factor (e.g., parental earnings) at different ages and corresponding periods in their development. Second  may be the case that siblings born close together have a stronger influence on each other's behavior. That is, closely spaced siblings may experience stronger sibling peer effects. Regardless of the mechanism, we need to consider sibling spacing when accounting for the size of the sibling correlation. We return to this discussion in Section 5.2 below.",

In this section, we present the results of our accounting exercise, which explores a number of characteristics that are common to individuals within the same family, but which vary across families, to gauge the extent to which these factors contribute to the high sibling correlation in crime. In particular, we consider parental education and income, parental criminality, and family structure. We choose these particular variables because of the existing literature demonstrating their relative importance in explaining crime. For instance, an individual's education has been demonstrated to have a causal impact on his own criminal behavior (Lochner and Moretti 2004;Machin et al. 2011;Hjalmarsson et al. forthcoming) and has even been demonstrated to have an impact on the next generation's criminal behavior (Meghir et al. 2012). These facts, combined with the evidence on the intergenerational transmission of education (see, e.g., Holmlund et al. 2011), suggest that parental education may explain a substantial share of sibling crime correlations. Similar findings have been found for parental income. Akee et al. (2010) demonstrate that parental income has a causal impact that lowers the probability of minor offenses among children and the likelihood that a child self-reports that he/she has sold drugs.",

If crime among the younger cohorts of parents accounts for a larger share of the sibling correlation than does crime among the older cohorts of parents, then this may indicate that measurement error in parental criminality is biasing our measures of its quantitative importance downwards. 29 After splitting the sample this way, we see that the amount of the brother correlation in Crime that can be accounted for by parental criminality rises from 10 to 14 %. The amount of the sister correlation explained by parental criminality, however, remains fairly constant across samples, changing from 13 to 12 % when moving from the older to the younger parents. Similar increases for brothers, and no increases for sisters, can be seen across all extensive margin variables. Importantly, we do not see the same increase in explanatory power of parental income and education if we rerun that experiment after splitting the sample into younger and older cohorts. Thus, we conclude that measurement error in parental criminality may bias the explanatory power of parental criminality downwards more for brothers than for sisters. Thus, parental criminality may explain the same amount of the variation among brothers as among sisters.",

While this is true to some extent, a factor analysis of our explanatory variables concludes that there are three clearly distinct factors. Factor 1 is based on parents' education and income. Factor 2 represents parental criminality. Factor 3 represents household structure. Mother's age at first birth, however, loads equally onto all three factors.",

Empirical work done by economists lends further support to this hypothesis (Oettinger 2000;Ouyang 2004;Altonji et al. 2013). 30 Two mechanisms stand out in this literature: (i) older siblings act as role models and (ii) older siblings act as suppliers of substances, opportunities, and/or delinquent peers. Direct sibling effects may also be gender specific. A stronger same-sex transmission of criminal behavior could be an indication of the presence of role modeling. Role model identification theory implies that role models are more often of the same gender (Ruef et al. 2003). More generally, homophily is prevalent in many relationships; that is, individuals have a tendency to bond easier with similar others (McPherson et al. 2001).",

            "text": "Overall, neighborhood correlations are quite small for all but the most severe offenders, and even these are much lower than their corresponding sibling correlations. If the simple linear additive model posited in Eq. 1 is correct, then this result would indicate that factors shared by siblings other than shared neighbor- hoods are more important for an individual's criminality than factors shared by individuals growing up in the same neighborhood. At the same time, if we relate the size of our estimated neighborhood correlations to the size of the comparable sibling correlations, neighborhood correlations have the potential to explain between 7 and 13 % of the sibling correlation beyond that explained by our full set of family-specific control variables. This is similar to the amount accounted for by parental education and income. As such, neighborhoods cannot be disregarded as unimportant. One potential explanation for our small estimated neighborhood correlations is that our definition of neighborhoods is too broad, both in the geographical sense and in the sense that neighborhoods may not map well into peer groups. Alternatively, one might want to focus more on the schools that children attend (as in Gaviria and Raphael 2001, Calv\u00f3-Armengol et al. 2009, and Liu et al. 2012 or on close neighbors. Sariaslan et al. (2013) study younger cohorts and, therefore, have access to more narrow measures of neighborhoods. They look within the Small Area Marketing codes created by Statistics Sweden to define small, homogenous neighborhoods. They also look within schools. But they still find no large neighborhood effect. Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m (2004) argues that the small neighborhood effects reported in many Swedish studies may be due to the success of the Swedish welfare state. This is certainly one possibility. For the USA, Johnson (2007) reports large neighborhood correlations in criminal behavior and incarceration. He also reports that growing up in low-quality neighborhoods increases the likelihood that one has ever been incarcerated. On the other hand, neighborhood correlations in educational attainment are quite similar in the USA and Sweden and quite small. 38 It may, therefore, be hard to argue that our result is \"Sweden specific\". Lastly, one should keep in mind that we are studying the overall neighborhood effect and not the effect of growing up in an extremely disadvantaged neighborhood. 39 To assess the impact that neighborhood quality might have on our sibling correlations, we run an additional experiment. We start by defining a measure of neighborhood quality based on the average education level of parents in the neighborhood, the average income level of parents, and the share of immigrant parents in each neighborhood. 40 We then create a dummy variable equal to one for the 10 % of our sibling sample living in the highest quality neighborhoods and a second dummy variable equal to one for the 10 % of our sibling sample living in the lowest quality neighborhoods. We estimate neighborhood 38 For the USA, see Solon et al. (2000). For Sweden, see Lindahl (2011). 39 The Moving to Opportunity program focuses more on helping families leave extremely low-quality neighborhoods (Ludwig et al. 2001;Kling et al. 2005). Krivo and Peterson (1996) also study the connection between particularly disadvantaged neighborhoods and crime. 40 Neighborhood quality refers to the characteristics of all of the parents living in the same parish as the sibling when the sibling was 15 years old. We first create three different percentile rankings for each parish: one based on parental education, a second based on parental income, and a third based on the share of parents who were not born in Sweden. Immigration status has been included in order to reflect the potential effects of segregation, discrimination, and the feeling of social exclusion that is often discussed in the Swedish debate concerning troubled neighborhoods. These three percentile rankings are then weighted equally into a final percentile ranking of neighborhood quality. correlations for high-and low-quality neighborhoods, and we produce new estimates of the sibling correlation for siblings living in these high-and low-quality neighborhoods. 41 In Table 7, we see that the neighborhood correlations are consistently higher in low-quality neighborhoods than in high-quality neighborhoods. More importantly, the ratio between the neighborhood correlation and the sibling correlation is always larger for low-quality neighborhoods than for high-quality neighborhoods. This means that neighborhood effects can potentially explain more of the sibling correlation in low-quality neighborhoods, which leads us to conclude that neighborhood quality may be one of the factors that makes siblings similar in terms of their criminal behavior. However, such neighborhood effects are still smaller in magnitude than the roles played by parental criminality and family structure.",

In practice, however, the computational burden of estimating this two-way crossed-effects model with an interaction term is extremely challenging (given the very large number of families and neighborhoods in our data). But, more importantly, the ideal data needed to estimate this model simply do not exist-i.e., two relatively closely spaced siblings who grew up in different neighborhoods (of varying quality), but who still lived with both parents in the same intact family.  Coefficients are odds ratios from logistic regressions. Standard errors in parentheses are robust. All regressions include birth year and gender dummies. Controls for parish size, family SES, family structure, parental criminality, and neighborhood quality are also included. Family SES 3 and neighborhood quality 3 are the reference categories * Significant at 10 % Thus, we consider an alternative test for the presence of family-neighborhood interaction effects that uses standard regression techniques (see, e.g., Winkleby et al. 2006). Specifically, we use our neighborhood quality index to place neighborhoods into quality quintiles, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest. We then create a similar index for family socio-economic status based on the incomes and education levels of both parents. Families are also placed into five SES quintiles, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest. To look for significant interaction effects, we estimate different versions of the following equation:",

Although most of the estimated odds ratios are small and statistically insignificant, we do see two distinct patterns. First, individuals from families that are \"well matched\" with neighborhoods, i.e., SES 1 families living in SES 1 neighborhoods and SES 5 families living in SES 5 neighborhoods, appear to experience a small, but statistically significant, protective effect. Second, siblings from low-SES families (SES 1) fair worse if they live in relatively high-SES areas (quality 4 and 5) at age 15. This second result could simply be due to negative selection; for instance, these families may have been placed by the social services in these neighborhoods. If this is the case, then these significant coefficients do not represent true interaction effects. Alternatively, it could be that a sense of relative deprivation and/or frustration gives rise to a higher crime rate among those who come from low-SES families but grow up in relatively high-quality neighborhoods.",

First, we find that family background and community factors shared by siblings account for 24 % of the variation in the likelihood of having any conviction. Second, we find even larger sibling correlations for measures of the intensity and severity of the criminal career: violent and property offenses versus other offenses, the likelihood of incarceration, the number of convictions, and longer prison sentences. These patterns are similar across (i) crime types, (ii) male, female, and mixed sibling pairs, and (iii) siblings more and less closely spaced. Third, our analysis of which family and community background characteristics account for the sibling crime correlations suggests that neighborhood identifiers and parental education and income play a relatively less important role than parental criminality and family structure. These results are in line with the previous literature on intergenerational crime. Neighborhood effects, however, tend to receive much more attention in the US literature. Fourth, all of these controls taken together still only explain one third of the sibling crime correlation, even for siblings spaced close together. Fifth, siblings spaced more closely together are more similar in terms of their criminal behavior.",

This is not the same as saying which effect would be the most policy relevant or cost-effective-although our hope is that a better understanding of the sibling correlation may, in the long run, help us to better understand the etiology of crime and, hence, aide in the design of better policy.",

Third, the results presented in this paper are conditional on the structure of the environment in place in Sweden during the time period studied, and cannot readily be extended to make statements about the importance of (for example) neighborhood effects in the USA today. However, the fact that sibling correlations in crime are so high, even in Sweden with its high degree of relative income equality and extensive welfare state polices, should be of great interest to a broader audience. It really does put the spotlight on the role of family background and circumstances as important determinants of criminal behavior. A final caveat-and our fourth result listed above-is that it is striking that we are only able to account for one third of the large sibling correlation.",

Of course, we recognize that there are a number of mechanisms that our limited set of control variables does not capture. One possibility is genes and inherited characteristics that are correlated with criminal behavior. For instance, adoption studies that use the criminal records of the biological and adoptive parents to disentangle the importance of pre-birth (genes, prenatal environment, and perinatal conditions) and post-birth factors for generating intergenerational criminal relationships find evidence that pre-birth factors do play a significant role (Hjalmarsson and Lindquist 2013). Twin studies also report an important role for genetic factors in the etiology of antisocial behavior and crime (Ishikawa and Raine 2002;Eley et al. 2013). We would argue, however, that by controlling for the education, income, and criminal behavior of both biological parents, we have indeed controlled for most of the relevant genetic factors (albeit very imprecisely).",

In particular, a mother's willingness to plan and save for the future appears to matter. These remain important even after controlling for measures of parental income and education, family structure, and social problems. There is also increasing evidence that siblings may have a large influence on each other through sibling peer effects (see, e.g., Rowe and Farrington 1997, Altonji et al. 2013and Schr\u00f8ter Joensen and Skyt Nielsen 2015. However, we are not able to provide clear evidence of this in our context. Lastly, we have only begun to scratch the surface on understanding the potential role of family-neighborhood interaction effects. Continued work in the area of neighborhood effects, peer effects, sibling peer effects, and sibling similarities in criminal behavior is one avenue for moving beyond the analysis of statistical risk factors and into the realm of understanding the mechanisms underlying antisocial behavior and crime. at least x other crimes Other Crime Fig. 8 Neighborhood correlations in property crime, violent crime, and other crime",

We do this, so that large families living in small neighborhoods will not dominate the estimation. Alternatively, one could estimate neighborhood, family, and individual variance components simultaneously by applying STATA's xtmelogit to the whole sample and estimating a model with three levels. But due to our large sample, our use of control variables, and the large number of correlations that we need to calculate in this paper, this approach becomes infeasible; running time and convergence become problematic. In some cases, we have used both methods and the answer does not change. The fact that we randomly sample one child from each family does not seem to matter much either.",

We have access to data on co-offending (see Lindquist and Zenou 2014 for a description of these data). In these data, we see that siblings co-offend when they are teenagers and presumably still living together. Adult siblings rarely co-offend. In contrast to this, the size of our contemporaneous sibling effect does not vary substantially by siblings' age (results not reported here). Thus, we do not believe that co-offending is the main driver of the contemporaneous effect. Furthermore, girls rarely co-offend with their sisters. Despite this, estimates of the contemporaneous sister effect are still significant. Girls are more likely to co-offend with a brother than a sister. But we see no contemporaneous effect for mixed-sex siblings. These results also speak against co-offending as being the main source of the contemporaneous same-sex sibling effect that we see in our data.",
