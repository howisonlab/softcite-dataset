            "text": "Hydrogen, the simplest element in the universe, has a surprisingly complex phase diagram. Because of applications to planetary science, inertial confinement fusion and fundamental physics, its high-pressure properties have been the subject of intense study over the past two decades. While sophisticated static experiments have probed hydrogen's structure at ever higher pressures, studies examining the higher-temperature regime using dynamic compression have mostly been limited to optical measurement techniques. Here we present spectrally resolved x-ray scattering measurements from plasmons in dynamically compressed deuterium. Combined with Compton scattering, and velocity interferometry to determine shock pressure and mass density, this allows us to extract ionization state as a function of compression. The onset of ionization occurs close in pressure to where density functional theory-molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations show molecular dissociation, suggesting hydrogen transitions from a molecular and insulating fluid to a conducting state without passing through an intermediate atomic phase."

In recent decades, owing to fundamental questions about the structure of gas giants [2][3][4][5][6] , hydrogen's high-pressure properties have been the subject of intense study. Diamond anvil cell experiments have explored the low-temperature, high-pressure structure of hydrogen. It has been shown to remain in an insulating, molecular state at pressures in excess of 300 GPa (ref. 7) and recent work has focused on its phases near room temperature [8][9][10][11][12][13] . Sophisticated ab initio simulation techniques have advanced in tandem, resulting in a wide computational exploration of the hydrogen phase diagram, see McMahon and coauthors 14 .",

Experiments using reverberating shock waves to produce conductive liquid hydrogen at 140 GPa and temperatures near 3,000 K (refs 15,16), reached densities very close to those predicted by Wigner and Huntington 17 . Recent experiments using the Sandia Z machine reached 300 GPa and 1,800 K, finding evidence for a liquid-liquid insulator-metal transition from optical reflectivity measurements 18 . In single-shock experiments, the temperatures reached are still higher, and the transition to metallic behaviour is driven by the combined pressure and temperature reached in the shock front. These experiments produce thermodynamic states lying on the primary shock Hugoniot. Optical reflectivity measurements have been used to observe a transition to metallic behaviour in laser-driven samples near 50 GPa and 8,000 K (ref. 19). X-ray scattering makes it possible to directly observe electron properties in such an experimental configuration, but until now it has not progressed beyond proof-of-principle in shock-compressed cryogenic samples 20 . In this work, we use a single-shock laser compression scheme, employing x-ray scattering to directly measure the ionization of laser-shocked deuterium as a function of compression.",

We illustrate this in the hydrogen phase diagram shown in Fig. 1, which shows that most parts of the interiors of brown dwarfs (Gliese-229b, shown in brown) and giant planets (Jupiter, shown in black) are also at off-Hugoniot states. However, the P -T range of our experiments covers one of the most interesting parts of the Jovian interior. The flattening of the isentrope at B25 GPa is due to the dissociation of the hydrogen molecules. As shown by French et al. 23 , this is accompanied by a drastic increase in the dc electrical conductivity which represents a continuous nonmetal-to-metal transition. This result is validated with the x-ray scattering measurements presented in this study, where we find that the average ionization becomes significant just at this point on the Hugoniot curve, and coincident with dissociation. This is of great importance for planetary physics when validating equation of state (EOS) data that are used for interior 2,23 and dynamo models 24 .",

Experiments at the Omega laser have demonstrated the viability of backscattering techniques for density measurements in cryogenic deuterium 20 . Here we combine forward and backward x-ray scattering observations with a simultaneous measurement of shock velocity using the velocity interferometry system for any reflector (VISAR) technique to infer pressure and mass density from the velocity of the shock and EOS tables. With a delocalized electron density measured using x-ray scattering, we can then directly determine the ionization state of shocked deuterium as a function of compression. We compare the onset of ionization with the molecular dissociation fraction calculated from density functional theory-molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations and find that both quantities increase sharply between compressions of 2.5rr/r 0 r3.3.

These photons were collimated through a 400-mm-diameter aperture in the target, timed to probe the shock as it reached the x-ray collection ports. The x-rays were scattered from the shock front and collected through 400 mm ports at 45\u00b0and 135\u00b0from the incident photons. The probe pulse was delayed 10-20 ns after the rise of the drive beam, allowing the shock to traverse a distance of 350 mm to reach the volume accessed by the x-ray diagnostic port. The fields of view of the spectrometers were shielded with Ni-coated cones (40\u00b0opening angle) from ambient x-ray emission and stray light from both laser beams. The radiation was collected and spectrally dispersed with highly ordered pyrolytic graphite crystal spectrometers 35 curved at a 107-mm radius. The drive laser beam used a phase plate to produce a round 600-mm-diameter spot on target. The forward scattering measurements were made on deuterium shock-driven by a frequency-doubled 2-ns-long laser pulse producing a wavelength of 527 nm at the target. The backscattering measurements were made operating the same laser at the 1,054 nm fundamental. These shots used 4 ns drive pulses at moderate compression and 6 ns at higher compression, all at nominal intensities of 4 \u00c2 10 13 W cm \u00c0 2 .",

            "text": "To determine the mass density-and hence compression r/r 0 -of the target using measured shock velocity, one of two approaches is necessary. Impedance matching techniques can be used to determine particle velocity in addition to shock velocity, closing the Rankine-Hugoniot relations [38][39][40] and directly constraining state variables in the target. Alternatively, existing theoretical models or measured EOS values can be used to calculate compression from the shock velocity measured with VISAR; that is the approach used in this study. While one of several modern EOS models could be effectively used, we have chosen the quotidian EOS (ref. 41) because of its computational efficiency and the fact that it represents a middle ground between popular EOS models in the pressure regime of interest. Because we rely on an EOS that is not perfectly known, this approach requires careful accounting for that uncertainty in our inferred compression. Hicks et al. 42 gave a comparison of both calculated and measured EOS values and their associated experimental uncertainties. For our experimental conditions, variations in EOS models are relatively small; near 15 GPa, where we observe the onset of ionization, models vary by about 10% in compression at a given pressure ( Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary  Methods). This uncertainty is included in the error bar of quoted values of mass density. Figure 3 shows a VISAR streak record along with the extracted shock velocities for high-power laser drive conditions. Also shown are simulation results from HYDRA, a radiationhydrodynamics code widely used for modelling inertial confinement fusion and laser-plasma experiments 43 . HYDRA accurately reproduces the measured late-time shock velocities when scattering is performed. Stray light from the drive beam is visible for 2 ns early in the streak. Shock breakout from the Al pusher into D 2 occurs near the end of the drive beam where a discontinuous fringe shift is visible. As the shock decays, a drop in signal amplitude is visible in the raw data, since reflectivity falls as shock pressure and ionization decrease. The peak velocity immediately following shock breakout from the pusher is 22 km s \u00c0 1 with pressures near 50 GPa, which decays to 14 \u00b1 1 km s \u00c0 1 and 15 \u00fe 3.5/ \u00c0 4.5 GPa at 21 ns, the centre of the 2-ns-long x-ray probe.",

In the present case where weakly bound electrons in the compressed deuterium occupy states near the continuum, continuum depression plays a particularly important role. To minimize any ambiguity introduced by this model dependence, we have compared our results, which use a Stewart-Pyatt (SP) model 45 for ionization potential depression, with a set of calculations using the Eckert-Kr\u00f6ll (EK) 46 model. The resulting curves are shown in Fig. 5b, with the SP model in red and the EK model in blue. The contribution to the spectrum from bound-free scattering are shown separately as dashed curves, illustrating that the primary difference comes through the shift of the EK feature towards E 0 . We attribute this to a much higher value of continuum depression calculated by the EK model, DE EK \u00bc 10.2 eV compared with DE SP \u00bc 2.1 eV for SP. We note that in both cases a best fit is found for an ionization state of Z \u00bc 0.15 ( Supplementary Figs 3 and 4 and Supplementary  Methods). We conclude that, for very similar experimental drive conditions, plasmon and Compton scattering provide nearly identical ionization states; this is significant because the sensitivity of plasmon spectra and Compton scattering spectra to bound-free models and structure factors is very different. This finding indicates that contributions from bound-free scattering and interband transitions are accounted for by our data analysis and that interband transitions play a minor role in the interpretation of the data. Figure 6 summarizes measurements of ionization across several shock-drive and probe delay conditions producing compressions between r/r 0 \u00bc 2.8 and r/r 0 \u00bc 4.05. Measured ionization states for both forward and backscattered configurations are shown as a function of compression, along with predicted ionizations from several models. The compression values for the backscattering data points and the lowest compression case, where velocity measurements are not possible below the onset of optical reflectivity, were determined using hydrodynamic calculations benchmarked to VISAR measurements. The error bars in compression for these points include a 20% uncertainty in drive intensity and uncertainty between EOS models at the relevant pressures. The data indicate a sharp onset of ionization between 3 and 3.5 times compression. This onset is reproduced by average-atom simulations of a D ion system embedded in a plasma background 47 , but with lower absolute ionization values. The Thomas-Fermi model exhibits very little of the density dependence in the data at low compression. Similar results have been reported in x-ray scattering experiments on shock-compressed CH (ref. 48). We also show the deuterium dissociation curve calculated with the code FVT, a chemical picture model based on fluid variational theory 49 that predicts the onset of molecular dissociation at higher compressions than measured here.",

Figure 7a shows reflectivity calculated along the principal Hugoniot ( Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note 1). Comparisons are made at 808 nm with the results of Celliers et al. 19 and at 532 nm with the recent measurements by Loubeyre et al. 51 . Good agreement is found between experiment and theory. Between 20 and 50 GPa, DFT-MD is seen to produce somewhat higher reflectivities than the Loubeyre results, attributable to the fact that DFT-MD underestimates the bandgap systematically using exchange-correlation functionals like that of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (ref. 52), leading to early bandgap closure and an earlier onset of dissociation and, thereby, conduction. In Fig. 7b, the dynamic conductivity along the Hugoniot is plotted at a pressure range corresponding to our experimental conditions. The DC limit is plotted in the inset, showing that conductivity starts at very small values near 0.1 S m \u00c0 1 at 2.8 \u00c2 compression (black curve), rising orders of magnitude to a metallic conductivity of 10 5 S m \u00c0 1 near fourfold compression (yellow curve). This confirms the continuous transition from an insulating molecular fluid to a metallic degenerate electron liquid observed in the experiments.",

While ab initio physical picture theories represent the state-of-the-art in simulating hydrogen under extreme conditions, an explicit definition of ionization within a physical-picture model is difficult in pressure and temperature regimes where electron delocalization and finite temperatures blur the characteristics of free and bound electrons. To provide a comparison to our measurements we have calculated the dissociation of deuterium molecules along the Hugoniot using DFT-MD (ref. 50). DFT-MD couples a finitetemperature treatment of electrons using density functional theory with a molecular dynamics treatment of ion motion. The dissociated fraction, shown in red in Fig. 6, is estimated by tracking neighbouring ions in the system as the simulation evolves in time (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6 and Supplementary"
