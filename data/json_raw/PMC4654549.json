            "text": "The molecular mechanisms underlying stress-induced depression have not been fully outlined. Hence, the current study aimed at testing the link between behavioral changes in chronic mild stress (CMS) model and changes in hippocampal energy metabolism and the role of paroxetine (PAROX) in ameliorating these changes. Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: vehicle control, CMS-exposed rats, and CMS-exposed rats receiving PAROX (10 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally). Sucrose preference, open-field, and forced swimming tests were carried out. Corticosterone (CORT) was measured in serum, while adenosine triphosphate and its metabolites, cytosolic cytochrome-c (Cyt-c), caspase-3 (Casp-3), as well as nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) were measured in hippocampal tissue homogenates. CMS-exposed rats showed a decrease in sucrose preference as well as body weight compared to control, which was reversed by PAROX. The latter further ameliorated the CMS-induced elevation of CORT in serum (91.71\u00b11.77 ng/mL vs 124.5\u00b14.44 ng/mL, P\ue02c0.001) as well as the changes in adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (3.76\u00b10.02 nmol/mg protein vs 1.07\u00b10.01 nmol/mg protein, P\ue02c0.001). Furthermore, PAROX reduced the expression of Cyt-c and Casp-3, as well as restoring NOx levels. This study highlights the role of PAROX in reversing depressive behavior associated with stress-induced apoptosis and changes in hippocampal energy metabolism in the CMS model of depression.",

            "text": "Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. 1 Stressful life events are pivotal players in the incidence of depression, especially in individuals with a genetic predisposition. 2,3 In support of the role of stress in the incidence of depression, it has been reported that, in 70%-80% of the cases, the onset of the first episode of depression is preceded by a severe life event. 4 It is proposed that stress induces structural remodeling in the hippocampal formation, including atrophy, neuronal loss, and decreased neurogenesis as well as apoptosis, [5][6][7] which constitutes a newly emerging concept perceiving major depressive disorder (MDD) as a complex illness, associated with progressive morphological brain changes rather than change in the neurotransmitter balance per se. 8 In an elegant approach to simulate some of the environmental stressors culminating in the induction of MDD, Willner et al 9,10 adopted a modification of the experimental stress models of depression, namely the chronic mild stress (CMS) battery. In this battery, rats were exposed to a variety of mild and unpredictable stressors for a period of weeks. 11 A major token of this model is anhedonia, the decreased responsiveness to pleasurable stimuli, thus simulating that seen in MDD in humans. 11 Notably, the hippocampus, a highly plastic stress-sensitive region, is not only a crucial player in learning and memory but also pivotal for the regulation of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Noteworthy, reduced volume of this brain region has been reported in numerous clinical and preclinical studies of hippocampal volume changes in depression, 7,12 which lends further evidence of the central involvement of the hippocampus in regulating the central response to stress and eventually depression. In response to stress, the brain mounts a neuroendocrine stress response through the HPA axis, triggering behavioral, endocrine, and metabolic cascades. 13,14 Noteworthy, elevated glucocorticoid (GC) has been reported to underlie such hippocampal changes. Indeed, impaired glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) function has been suggested to be associated with HPA axis hyperactivity in depression. 15,16 Strenuous stress may induce apoptosis via genomic and non-genomic actions of the elevated GC 17 as well as affecting mitochondrial functions. 17,18 In addition to their critical role in energy production, 19 mitochondria are pivotal in apoptosis signaling. 20 Ample evidence associates neuroendocrine alterations and changes in mitochondrial signaling to the vicious cascades of immune cell activation and reactive oxygen species formation in depressive disorders. 19 Certainly, increased cytokine levels have been linked to signs of marked depressive illness. 21 Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that GC-induced apoptosis plays a key role in the induction of hippocampal neuronal damage. [22][23][24] In contrast to the effects of stress, chronic use of several classes of antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors had shown its ability to protect against stress-induced apoptosis 25,26 and to increase neurogenesis. [27][28][29] Although the pathophysiology of depression is still scantily understood, some studies have demonstrated that deficiencies in energy metabolism may be involved. 30 Hence, the current investigation aimed at characterizing the mechanism(s) underpinning the relation between depression and changes in hippocampal energy metabolism and the utility of paroxetine (PAROX), a clinically effective antidepressant drug, in rectifying such changes.",

After washing three times with tris buffered solution (TBS)/Tween (T) (1\u00d7 TBS, 0.1% T-2), the blots were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature with horse radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by washing three times with 15 mL of TBS/T. The blots were detected by the addition of the chromogenic substrate (4CN peroxidase substrate), which upon reacting with the peroxidase-labeled primary antibody developed a dark purple precipitate on the membrane.",

            "text": "In the present study, CMS-exposed rats showed an increased immobility time in FST, suggestive of increased desperate behavior, 53 a finding in-line with previous reports 52,54,55 documenting increased immobility in the FST as a consequence of CMS anhedonia. 11 Although Walsh and Cummins 56 and Katz et al 57 reported an association of low activity in the OFT with depressive behavior, paradoxically, in the current investigation, rats showed a higher locomotor activity both vertically and horizontally, compared to control. This paradoxic finding is consistent with some previous reports. 58,59 This may indicate a possible non-concordance of SPT with some other behavioral responses, including an anomalous decreased anxiety. 60 To further validate the induction of stress, the study showed a significant increase in serum CORT following 7 weeks of CMS exposure in comparison to control. Such a finding is in-line with previous reports. 49,52 At the end of the 11-week period, CORT concentrations showed a robust upsurge in response to CMS, compared to control. This finding confirms previously reported results. 15,61,62 This dysregulation may be attributed to the reduced GR expression and function. 15,16,[63][64][65] The deficit might be related to the hypoactivity of the serotoninergic system associated with depression, as the GR expression is dependent on the central 5-hydroxytryptamine tone. 66,67 This explanation is further verified by the ability of PAROX to reverse the elevation of the CMS-induced CORT. This finding supports other researches implicating antidepressants in amelioration of HPA axis hyperactivity, probably by modulating GR, via restoring its regulation by the serotoninergic tone.",

Such an observation is in harmony with recent findings implicating a causal relationship between apoptosis and CMS-induced hippocampal neurodegenration. 26,68 Indeed, PAROX ameliorated the CMS-enhanced expression of cytosolic Cyt-c as well as the increased Casp-3 activity. This finding points toward the value of PAROX in reversing stress-induced apoptosis. Noteworthy, the anti-apoptotic effects of various classes of antidepressants had favorably received considerable attention. 25 Notably, postmortem brains of depressed patients showed DNA fragmentation and neuronal apoptosis, suggesting an enhanced neuronal vulnerability in MDD. 5,6 Moreover, prolonged or excessive exposure to GCs is known to decrease neurogenesis and may promote apoptosis, 22,69 particularly in the hippocampus, 24 one of the most vulnerable brain regions to various neurobiological insults due to its high GRs content. 70,71 Both genomic and non-genomic actions of CORT have been linked to stress-induced changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) leading to the release of Cyt-c from inner mitochondrial membrane to cytosol. 17 In fact, the current study demonstrated enhanced expression of cytosolic Cyt-c, as well as its downstream player Casp-3 in CMS animals, suggestive of mitochondrial damage.",

[73][74][75] In the present study, CMS-exposed rats showed a significant increase in hippocampal ATP, ADP, AMP, and TAN associated with a decrease in AEC as well as ATP/ADP. Notably, AEC ratio represents the amount of the metabolically available energy which is stored in the TAN pool and provides a quantitative assessment of the cellular energy status. 76 Hence, the observed reduction in AEC seen may indicate high metabolic stress. Noteworthy, an AEC \ue02c0.5 is indicative of cell death, while values ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 indicate consumption of energy for defense mechanisms, against stress. 77 Consequently, it is expected that in the presence of any metabolic stress, cells will react with a depletion of ATP and a simultaneous increase in the AMP levels and a significant decrease in AEC. 78 Notably, in the current investigation, hippocampal cells showed a decline in the energy status, manifested as a decrease in AEC and the ATP/ADP ratio, paralleled with an increase in the ADP and AMP level in the CMS rats.",

            "text": "Despite the decrease in the AEC observed in the CMSexposed rats, paradoxically, the ATP level increased. A plausible explanation might reside in the low MMP gradient that hampers adequate mitochondrial energy production. 19 Alternatively, the observed increase in ATP may be attributed to the increased glycolysis, compensating, at least in part, the disturbed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ATP supply. Nonetheless, the ATP generated by glycolysis would not meet the high energy demand of such a metabolically active tissue like the brain, 79 hence creating a mismatch between the rates of ATP consumption and production, lending a reasonable explanation for the observed decrease of AEC. However, another plausible explanation might be due to mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel formation that enhances the release of Cyt-c, in the absence of mitochondrial depolarization and without loss of outer membrane integrity. These observations indicate that, instead of rupturing, a more selective mechanism of permeabilization is operating, like the formation of a pore in the outer membrane, a phenomenon unrelated to (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)induced changes in the membrane potential, which further implicates that the mitochondria may be still capable of creating some energy. 80,81 Interestingly, the observed increase in ATP seen in this study offers verification for the incidence of CMS-induced apoptosis. Notably, ATP depletion is associated with necrosis, while its availability is required for the development of apoptosis. 76,[82][83][84] This study reported the successful amelioration of the CMS-induced increase in Casp-3 activity and Cyt-c expression in the cytosol by PAROX, hence implicating a suggested role of PAROX in alleviating the depressive symptoms through the modulation of the programmed cell death-mediated neuronal loss. A recent study reported a role of PAROX (10 mg/kg/day) in partially ameliorating some parameters related to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in rats exposed to modified stress-restress. 85 Several reports have implicated the increase in glutamate and induction of excitotoxicity to the increased cytosolic calcium transients, and further activation of the calcium-dependent neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) inducing hippocampal neuronal degeneration. In fact, increased extracellular glutamate levels have been demonstrated in the rat hippocampus by several acute and chronic stress paradigms. 86,87 This explanation was further supported by pervious findings from our laboratory 88 reporting an increase in hippocampal glutamate level accompanied by a reduction in gamma amino butyric acid due to decrease in glutamic acid decarboxylase activity in CMS paradigm. Contrary to this view, the present study reported a decrease in NO concentrations suggesting a decrease in NO synthase (NOS) activity. The presented result supports previous findings by Palumbo et al 89,90 where they observed a significant reduction in nNOS activity and NOx production in the hippocampus of CMS-exposed mice. The latter might be due to CORT inhibition of nNOS and mitochondrial NOS transcription in the rat brain. 91 Moreover, it has been previously reported in clinical studies that depressed patients had shown a decreased activity in the calcium-dependent constitutive NOS in the prefrontal cortex of depressed patients 92 as well as a reduction in NOS-containing neurons in the hypothalamus. 92 The latter might be due to CORT-inhibiting nNOS and mitochondrial NOS transcription in the rat brain. 91 Indeed, PAROX administration had successfully ameliorated this decrease in NO production as well as the dramatic increase in the serum CORT level suggestive of the protective role of NO in preventing apoptosis. [93][94][95][96] Accordingly, the present investigation highlights a role of energy changes (suggestive of mitochondrial changes) in the etiology of depression, associated with a chronic stress paradigm. This is further confirmed by the ability of PAROX to reverse CMS-induced energy changes, as well as apoptosis, which associated with ameliorating the CMS-related behavior as seen in the OFT and FST, as well as reversal of anhedonic behavior.",

This would suggest that metabolic disturbances resembling encephalopathy may underscore the basic neuropathology of depression at a far deeper level than currently realized. Viewing depression as a form of encephalopathy, and exploiting knowledge gleaned from our understanding of the neurochemistry and treatment of metabolic encephalopathy, may assist not only in our understanding of the neurobiology of depression but also in realizing new ideas in the pharmacotherapy of mood disorders.",

At week 11, the PAROX-treated rats showed a significant increase in the sucrose preference in comparison to week 5 (87.01\u00b12.27 vs 69.68\u00b14.26, P\ue02c0.001), which was nonsignificant from the original 98\u00b11.72 vs 87.34\u00b11.55, P\ue02c0.01). Furthermore, a separate one-way ANOVA (F (2,26) =6.077, P=0.0068) revealed that the sucrose preference was significantly lower in both stressed groups prior to PAROX treatment in comparison to their control at week 5 (P\ue02c0.05).
