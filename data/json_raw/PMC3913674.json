Food sharing among common vampire bats has been a classic textbook example of reciprocity, but this conclusion has been contested by alternative explanations. Here, we review factors that predict food sharing in vampire bats based on previously published and unpublished data, validate previous published results with more precise relatedness estimates, and describe current evidence for and against alternative explanations for its evolutionary stability. Although correlational evidence indicates a role for both direct and indirect fitness benefits, unequivocally demonstrating reciprocity in vampire bats still requires testing if and how bats respond to non-reciprocation.",

By making small sacrifices to help certain individuals in need, humans consciously or unconsciously make strategic social investments that strengthen social relationships in the short term and yield reciprocal benefits in the long-term. Such reciprocity requires that cooperative investments are contingent on cooperative returns. As a result, cooperative behavior leads to higher fitness gains than more selfish behavior.",

            "text": "Claims of reciprocity in nonhuman animals, however, are controversial for several reasons. Authors disagree on what key properties define reciprocity. [3][4][5] Naturalistic field studies tend to demonstrate correlations but not contingency between helping acts, and most controlled experiments involve helping acts with trivial costs or that require training, making their interpretation difficult. 4,5 Perhaps most importantly, reciprocity in social vertebrates may be embedded within complex social relationships. Decades of studies on primate cooperation suggest that cooperative behaviors like food sharing and social grooming are based on social bonds that are reciprocal over the long-term but do not necessarily involve strictly contingent short-term tit-for-tat exchanges. 3,[6][7][8] Experimental demonstrations of contingent reciprocity are difficult under these social conditions because the importance of single events may be overshadowed by a foundation of past cooperative behaviors, which are often difficult to manipulate under natural conditions. 1,3,8 A further complication is that individuals may exchange different kinds of services, and exchange rates may differ based on social status or access to resources. 9 One of the early classic examples of non-human reciprocity is the regurgitation of blood among female common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). 10 Food sharing among vampire bats might represent a powerful non-primate model for testing mechanisms of reciprocity because it is energetically costly to donors yet voluntary, and it is natural yet relatively easy to induce and measure. Moreover, reciprocal food sharing occurs between both kin and non-kin vampire bats, and may provide both direct and indirect fitness benefits. 10,11 The reciprocity hypothesis for vampire bat food sharing has, however, become increasingly contested. 4,[12][13][14][15][16][17] In a recent study, 11 we addressed some, but not all, of the alternative explanations for food sharing. Here, we review the known correlates of food sharing in vampire bats using both previously published and unpublished data, briefly discuss various definitions of the term reciprocity, and then describe evidence for and against various explanations for why vampire bats share food.",

Regurgitated food sharing in common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) was first noticed between mothers and pups in captivity, 18 but was later recognized as an important social behavior among adults in a field study conducted in Costa Rica from 1978 to 1983. 10 Here, vampire bats frequently switched between several roost trees and co-roosted with kin and non-kin. Mean kinship (relatedness) estimates within roosting groups were estimated at r = 0.03-0.11, 19 yet 95% of food sharing observed in the wild occurred between close kin (r > 0.2). Out of 110 food-sharing observations, 70% were mothers feeding their pups (r = 0.5). Of the 21 remaining non-maternal sharing events where kinship and co-roosting associations were known, 16 involved close kin (r = 0.25 or greater) and only one involved non-kin. 10 In particular, previously unpublished data from 2010 suggests that food sharing may require social bonds that require development over long periods of time. In Trinidad, we captured 5 females at 5 sites that were 20-90 km apart. We conducted 3 separate food-sharing experiments to see if these previously unfamiliar individuals would begin sharing food after being kept in captivity together for several weeks. To assess changes in allogrooming over time, we also conducted random focal sampling of allogrooming. We ranked the amount of time each bat spent grooming others, then tested whether the mean ranks across bats increased over time using a permutation test (lmPerm package in R). We never observed food sharing, but we found that bats began begging others on the second and third sets of fasting trials on days 21 and 36 ( Table 1). We also found that allogrooming increased over time among the previously unfamiliar bats [R 2 = 0.45, F(1,10) = 8.3, p = 0.018].",

Overall, fasting trials induced food sharing more often among frequent roostmates and long-term captive bats than those caught from the same roost or area with unknown associations ( Table 1), which is consistent with the hypothesis that food sharing requires long-term associations. trial, r = 0.9), and defined food sharing as the log-transformed donation rate from A to B, reciprocal help as the log-transformed donation rate from B to A, and kinship as the genetic relatedness estimate between A and B. 11 Some individuals originated from different captive populations, but all bats were housed in the same flight cage for several years. Under these conditions, we found that reciprocal help, but not kinship, predicted food sharing. Other predictors of food sharing included social grooming, donor sex, and a positive interaction between reciprocal help and kinship, which revealed that related pairs shared with even greater symmetry compared with less-related pairs. 11 In the original paper, we used 13 microsatellite loci to estimate kinship, 11 but we have since reanalyzed the data using more precise kinship estimates based on information from 25 variable microsatellite loci, and our conclusions have remained the same. Our new updated model (adjusted R 2 = 0.38, F(5,306) = 37.0) still includes reciprocal help (\u03b2 = 0.32, p < 0.0002), donor sex (\u03b2 = 0.26, p < 0.0002), allogrooming received (\u03b2 = 0.20, p < 0.0002), and the interaction between kinship and reciprocal help (\u03b2 = 0.06, p = 0.04) in the same order of relative importance. The model still does not include kinship (\u03b2 = 0.07, p = 0.6).",

In other words, reciprocity was most evident in the form of symmetrical helping across pairs rather than within pairs. We conducted a test of temporal contingency and found that the amount given from A to B in each trial correlated with the total amount previously given from B to A during the most recent donation. Yet, the correlation was weak (r = 0.28) and apparent only after controlling for the total amount received by the recipient in the trial. 11 Hungry bats were fed by an average of 4 partners per trial, and these were typically the same partners across repeated trials but not always. In summary, the bats did not perform strictly balanced exchanges in isolated pairs, and symmetry in sharing was most obvious over longer time spans as found in primate cooperation. 3,8 ",

Definitions of reciprocity have varied greatly over time and between authors 3-6,21-24 ever since Trivers 21 first described \"reciprocal altruism\" (now widely recognized as a misnomer since reciprocal altruism enforces mutual benefit). In this paper, Trivers 21 implicitly lumped all helping behaviors yielding future direct fitness benefits into his definition, but he later clarified reciprocal altruism as a special case of this broader category. 25 In sharp contrast, we observed food sharing consistently among kin and non-kin that have been housed together in longterm captivity ( Table 1). Under these conditions, all females are generally fed when fasted, including females born in different populations but housed with others for multiple years (discussed below). Although observations of food sharing have been mostly restricted to groups with known levels of high association, sharing between bats from different populations has also been observed once in Costa Rica. 10 Therefore, factors other than previous association, such as variations in behavior due to geographic origin or stress, might also explain the presence or absence of food sharing across these groups ( Table 1).",

In this captive experiment, past help predicted donations but only when kin were absent, while in previous field observations, kinship predicted donations but all cases of reciprocal help were not known ( Table 2). Therefore, the roles of reciprocal help and kinship could not be tested simultaneously in the original study. 10 In a more recent 2013 study, 11 we tested the relative roles of reciprocal help and kinship, by inducing 204 cases of food-sharing in 20 common vampire bats of mixed sex (9 females) and kinship over a 2-y period. For all potential pairs that could share food, we estimated donation amounts by time spent mouth-licking (which strongly correlated with mass gained during the 2 h the relative importance of partner control and partner choice in vampire bats would be difficult, and would involve comparing how bats respond to non-reciprocation in both the presence and absence of alternative partners. Resource exchange markets should be less common between conspecifics, which have access to the same pool of resources, but such models can still apply to vampire bats for two reasons. First, one cooperative service, such as grooming, can be traded for others, as found in primates. [7][8][9]36 This possibility could be verified by testing if a partner that is unable to reciprocate food donations compensates by increasing time spent grooming. Second, even if blood is only exchanged for blood, its value for each vampire bat fluctuates largely over a 24 h period and differs drastically depending on whether that individual has fed successfully. 10 This is because, like social carnivores that hunt cooperatively, vampire bats typically acquire either a large meal or none at all. Unlike social hunters however, vampire bats usually feed individually rather than as a group, and blood may be easier to share at the roost than at the wound site. It is worth noting however that vampire bats have also been observed both fighting and feeding at the same wound. 19 ",

If bats form social bonds that provide mostly direct, but also indirect fitness benefits, and if the adaptive value of social bonds is actively enforced by reciprocity, then several observations can be explained. 23 First, this would explain why kinship predicts sharing in wild bats (where such bonds may typically form among kin), but not in captive bats when controlling for association, social grooming, and reciprocal help. 11 Second, it would explain why the food-sharing network in both captive and wild vampire bats is female-biased, symmetrical, consistent, and correlated with mutual social grooming. Finally, complex social bonds as found in some primates, 7 could also help explain why vampire bats are outliers for residual brain and neocortex size among bats. 37,38 The social bond hypothesis for food sharing predicts that vampire bats will make cooperative investments of different types (e.g., social grooming, tolerance for feeding at the same source) within the same food-sharing partners over time, alter these cooperative investments slowly depending on how the cooperative returns compare with other individuals (partner choice) and past returns (partner control), and compensate for inabilities to reciprocate food sharing by increasing other services, such as social grooming. Finally, food sharing manipulation should be possible not only by controlling social experiences, but also The broadest definitions of reciprocity are based on observed outcomes. For example, some authors use reciprocity to refer merely to correlations between help given and received when controlling for kinship, 26 or in other cases even when such helping is based on kinship (e.g., \"symmetry-based reciprocity\"). 27,28 Food sharing in vampire bats clearly fits these very broad definitions. On the other end of the spectrum are very narrow definitions. For instance, some authors suggest reciprocity requires planned investments and expected returns where \"individuals must choose between the immediate reward of defecting and the long-term reward of cooperating.\" 12 Some authors distinguish between positive reciprocity (rewarding cooperators) and negative reciprocity (punishing cheats), or between reciprocity (where costly cooperative investments are made by both partners) and pseudoreciprocity (where costly investment by one partner leads to a non-costly byproduct benefit from the other). 4,29 Such distinctions can be useful in some contexts, but can also create confusion. For example, many reciprocity definitions require showing that a helping act poses not only energetic costs but also \"net fitness costs at the time it is provided in natural populations.\" 4 Helping behaviors typically pose some energetic cost, but there is no putative case of cooperation where this \"temporary fitness cost\" has been demonstrated. 4 Indeed, it is unclear how an experimenter could clearly demonstrate that an adaptive helping behavior (which increases expected lifetime fitness by definition) somehow simultaneously decreases expected lifetime fitness temporarily during the social interaction.",

Reciprocity defined in this broad way is synonymous with the enforcement of mutual benefits, 24 a phenomenon that has been well-demonstrated in interspecific mutualisms.

Biological markets 30,31 often result when different types of organisms have access to different resources, and at least one type can choose among several exchange partners. In this case, reciprocity may occur primarily through partner choice and partner switching. The more partners are locked into a repeated dyadic interaction, the more likely that enforcement will take the form of partner control (reward and punishment of the same partner over time). Testing food sharing poses a large benefit to recipients, and kinship between donors and possible recipients has a low mean and high variance. 10,19 Hence, indiscriminate sharing within roosts is unlikely to be evolutionarily stable when individuals vary in cooperativeness or against enforcement strategies such as kin discrimination or reciprocity.",

One example is pseudoreciprocity, 13,39 which assumes that food sharing is stable because it ensures the survival of roost-mates that are valuable for providing some byproduct service such as broadcasting social information about prey locations 40,41 or for keeping offspring warm. 42 But even in these scenarios subtle cheating may be possible. 43 Another suggestion is that non-kin food sharing is manipulation not cooperation. 4 Harassment often plays an important role in primate sharing, 7,44,45 but is unlikely to strongly influence food sharing in vampire bats because begging bats are easily rejected and donors initiate the majority of food-sharing bouts by approaching, grooming, and licking the mouth of hungry subjects. 11 Multilevel selection models of vampire bat food sharing argue that neither kin discrimination nor reciprocity is needed to stabilize food sharing, because cooperative genotypes can assort themselves passively without enforcement behaviors. 14,16,17 To explain these scenarios from an inclusive fitness perspective, indiscriminate sharing within roosts is expected to provide indirect fitness benefits as long as the average within-roost kinship exceeds 0.05. 14 If helping nearby non-kin is simply less costly to inclusive fitness than allowing kin to starve, then selection can favor indiscriminate or imprecise kin altruism based on proximity, association, or familiarity. This is especially likely when limited dispersal is typical under natural conditions. 46 It is then possible that these symmetrical, but imprecise, cues also lead to symmetrical helping in captivity.",
