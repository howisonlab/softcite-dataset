Use of corticosteroids is a potential prognostic factor affecting mortality in patients with perforated diverticular disease. Corticosteroids are widely prescribed for inflammatory diseases, malignancies and after organ transplantation, in order to inhibit an inflammatory response. [9][10][11] At the same time, corticosteroids have been associated with bowel perforation in patients with diverticular disease. Three case-control studies reported increased ORs of 1.7 to 28.3 and one cohort study reported a relative risk of 2.2. [12][13][14][15] A recent meta-analysis showed ORs for perforation of diverticular disease after use of corticosteroids of 2.17 to 31.90. 16 There are several reasons why mortality may be increased in patients with perforated diverticular disease who use corticosteroids. Disease severity might be masked by use of corticosteroids, 17 leading to incorrect staging of disease severity and, consequently, inadequate treatment. 6 Corticosteroid use might hamper wound healing as well through its anti-inflammatory effects, by suppressing cellular wound responses and by inducing diabetes, and thus increasing the risk of wound infection. 18 A systematic review also showed that corticosteroid use may increase the risk of anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery. 19 Use of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. 20 In perforated diverticulitis, undiagnosed and untreated adrenal insufficiency may lead to an Addisonian crisis, which increases mortality risk in affected patients. 21 ",

Identification of perforated and non-perforated diverticular disease was based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes (see online supplementary appendix 1 for specification of the codes). The codes used for perforated diverticular disease have a positive predictive value ranging from 0.73 to 0.75. 25 There were no restrictions in corticosteroid dose or treatment duration. Patients diagnosed during an emergency room visit were excluded because of the low predictive value of emergency room diagnoses; diagnostic accuracy improves with more extensive diagnostic procedures. 26 The year 2005 as start of follow-up was chosen in order to provide a 1-year prediagnosis period in which exposure to corticosteroids could be assessed similarly in all patients. Patient follow-up began on the hospital admission date for perforated diverticular disease and ended on death, emigration or end of follow-up on 30 November 2013, whichever came first.",

One-year mortality risk was even higher for new corticosteroid users: 52.5%. Thus, corticosteroid use was clearly associated with an increased mortality risk for patients with perforated diverticular disease, continuing until at least 1 year after diagnosis, regardless of corticosteroid dose. This is the first large cohort study comparing mortality risks between corticosteroid users and non-users among patients with perforated diverticular disease. The advantage of the cohort approach is the ability to calculate absolute mortality risks, which can inform clinical practice. Our study showed that corticosteroid use is a strong indicator for 1-year mortality. An earlier study of patients with perforated peptic ulcer disease reported a 30-day mortality ratio of 2.1 after corticosteroid use. 27 This is in line with the increased mortality risk (adjusted HR of 1.96 for 30-day mortality) that we found among current users of systemic corticosteroids in the present study.",

Determination of exposure was based on redeemed prescriptions, which may not always coincide completely with medication taken by patients. 28 We also did not consider use of corticosteroids for longer than a year before hospital admission. Also, since prednisolone and prednisone were the most frequently used systemic steroids (89%), the results in first line apply to this patient category; whether our results also apply to patients using steroids with high first pass metabolism needs further study. Finally, perforated diverticular disease may be misclassified, 6 17 as the sensitivity of relevant ICD codes is not 100% accurate. Since misclassification is probably more likely in corticosteroid users (due to blinding of symptoms and severity of the condition), mortality risk is potentially overestimated if less severe cases in corticosteroid users go undetected. 25 However, in analyses stratified by type of surgery, which most likely harmonises the diagnostic category, a similar increased risk was found.",

For instance, high mortality among patients using corticosteroids may be explained partially by the underlying diseases for which corticosteroids were prescribed.
