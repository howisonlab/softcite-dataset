The genes encoding the CTLA4 and CD28 map to the human chromosome 3q13-q23, which is linked to asthma in Hispanics, 6 Dutch, 7 and numerous other populations. CTLA4 affects the upregulation of serum IgE levels, a phenotype of asthma. 8 In genetic studies, the CTLA4 promoter (-318C/T) polymorphism was found to be associated with asthma severity while exon 1 (+49 A/G) was associated both BHR 9 and total serum levels of IgE. 10 The high-affinity IgE receptor 1 (FCER1) is involved in the induction of immune responses in atopic disease by facilitating IgE-dependent activation of mast cells and basophils. 11 The gene encoding FCER1B influences the total serum levels of IgE and interacts synergistically with the functional polymorphism (4G/ 5G) at the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter region to alter asthma susceptibility. 12 The -109C/T polymorphism of the FCER1B gene is also associated with increased total serum IgE levels in patients with asthma. 13 We began this study based on the hypothesis that the total serum IgE levels are largely determined by genetic factors. Each polymorphism of multiple genes has a relatively small effect on IgE levels, finally setting the IgE level through influencing numerous genes. Since both the CTLA4 and FCER1B genes can determine the total serum levels of IgE (an intermediate phenotype of asthma), we investigated whether increased serum IgE and susceptibility in Korean children with asthma are associated with CTLA4 +49A/G and FCER1B -654C/T polymorphisms. In addition, we investigated if the phenotype produced by the two polymorphisms is synergistic in Korean children with asthma. Such an effect of the CTLA4 and FCER1B genes has been previously demonstrated to influence the total serum IgE levels in the Japanese population, but we intended to expand the study to Korean children with asthma. 10 ",

When the subjects were divided into four combination groups and tested for the frequency of asthma or atopic asthma, the combined allele frequencies did not differ between the children with asthma and those without (Table 4). However, when the combined allele frequencies of children with Dp/Df (-) and Dp/Df (+) asthma were tested, those with Dp/Df (+) asthma carried an in-creased combined genotype of risk allele compared to those with Dp/Df (-) asthma (Table 5). We then investigated the association between the total serum IgE, Dp/Df-IgE levels, and the combination groups of the CTLA4 and FCER1B genes. The log Dp-IgE showed an increasing trend in children with asthma by linear regression from the low-risk group 1 (CTLA4 GG and FCER1B CC) to high-risk group 4 (CTLA4 GA+AA and FCER1B CT+TT) (P=0.031), while the log Df-IgE showed an increased trend in both the children with asthma and those with atopic asthma (P=0.020, P=0.049, respectively).

CTLA4 serves as an important function in the immune system by forming the receptor-ligand complexes that trigger the co-stimulatory pathway. 3 This pathway regulates the development of Th2 cells and ultimately determines the magnitude of the systemic immune response. 4 The gene encoding the CTLA4 is also known to influence the phenotypes of asthma such as the IgE levels. 8 Despite this, previous studies have thus far suggested that no link exists between the CD28/CTLA4 region and asthma. 16 In agreement with these findings, the frequency of the CTLA4 +49A/G polymorphisms in this study did not vary significantly in those with asthma, and as such, this polymor- Table 5.

These results suggest that the CTLA4 +49A/G polymorphism appears to affect the production of excessive IgE, particularly the Dp/Df-specific IgE. The sensitization of a specific allergen is extremely important to the development of atopy and as such is an independent risk factor for the development of asthma in children.

The alleles of the two genes were combined and classified from groups 1-4 according to the increased number of the risk alleles. We found that the genetic frequency of combined groups did not differ between the children with asthma or atopic asthma and controls, and also that the total serum IgE levels showed no increase from groups 1-4. Thus, the combination of genes was shown to be associated neither with asthma susceptibility nor with the upregulation of the total serum IgE levels. However, when tested for a Dp/Df-specific IgE, the combination of both the CTLA4 +49A/G and FCER1B -654C/ T polymorphisms displayed a marked difference in frequency between children with Dp/Df (-) asthma and those with Dp/Df (+) asthma and an increasing trend of Dp-specific IgE levels in those with asthma and Df-specific IgE levels in both those with asthma and children with atopic asthma. Similarly, we observed that the combination of the CTLA4 +49A/G and FCER1B E237G polymorphisms was associated with the increase in total IgE and Dp/Df-specific IgE levels, since the -654C/T and E237G polymorphisms of the FCER1B gene were in strong linkage disequilibrium (data not shown). These results suggest an additive influence of the two genes on the increased levels of Dp/Df-specific IgE.",

We also found that a combination of the CTLA4 and FCER1B polymorphisms upregulated the Dp/Df-specific IgE levels in contrast to previous work in the Japanese population, which displayed a co-stimulatory effect on total IgE levels.

First, the study was performed only on a selected group of people with asthma (Korean children) and thus is not a full representation of the general Korean population. Second, despite many SNPs in the CTLA4 and FCER1B genes, only a single SNP in each gene was selected. We chose the CTLA4 +49A/G polymorphism since it has been more stringently investigated than the -318C/T polymorphism, and the combinations of the IL-13 +2044A/G and CTLA4 +49A/G were associated with log IgE levels (unpublished data). We considered three SNPs (-109C/T, -654C/T, and E237G) in the FCER1B gene, assuming that the -654C/T and -109C/T polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium in the Japanese population. 12 We investigated the two polymorphisms (-654C/T and E237G), which displayed a strong linkage disequilibrium (LD=0.971) meaning that the -654C/T polymorphism was present as a representative SNP of the FCER1B gene. Third, the genetic results obtained in this study are yet to be verified in vivo and as such, the expression genetics may vary in terms of being representative of the general population. However, as the current study only included subjects who were diagnosed by a physician with consistent inclusion criteria and a defined distinctive phenotype (including IgE and bronchial responsiveness), the findings may be more reliable than in previous studies in the Japanese population that used only adults possessing a confounding factor (e.g., smoking).",
