However, its role in pancreatitis is less understood. We investigated the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-initiated MAPK signaling in pancreatitis to determine the potential for MEK inhibition in treating pancreatitis patients. METHODS-To examine the role of MEK signaling in pancreatitis, we used both genetic and pharmacologic approaches to inhibit the MAPK signaling pathway in a murine model of ceruleininduced pancreatitis. We generated mice harboring inducible short hairpins targeting the MEK isoforms Map2k1 and/or Map2k2 specifically in the pancreatic epithelium. We also used the MEK inhibitor trametinib to determine the efficacy of systemic inhibition in mice with pancreatitis. RESULTS-We demonstrated an essential role for MEK signaling in the initiation of pancreatitis. We showed that both systemic and parenchyma-specific MEK inhibition in established pancreatitis induces epithelial differentiation and stromal remodeling. However, systemic MEK inhibition also leads to a loss of the proliferative capacity of the pancreas, preventing the restoration of organ mass. CONCLUSIONS-MEK activity is required for the initiation and maintenance of pancreatitis. MEK inhibition may be useful in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis to interrupt the vicious cycle of destruction and repair but at the expense of organ regeneration.",

            "text": "Pancreatitis is the most frequent cause for hospitalization for a gastrointestinal disease. 1 Repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis cause a necrosis-fibrosis sequence leading to chronic pancreatitis (CP), which is characterized by progressive and potentially irreversible damage to the pancreas. 2 Although some acinar cells are lost during pancreatitis through necrosis, 3 other acinar cells undergo acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM). 4 ADM are proliferative ductlike structures theoretically capable of regenerating acinar cells lost in pancreatitis. [4][5][6] ADM induction has been linked to several mechanisms including ductal ectasia, 7 activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), 8,9 Notch receptors, 10,11 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Activation of EGFR by ectopic ligands has been demonstrated to drive ADM in ex vivo cultures 10,12 and in vivo. 12,13 High levels of RAS activity, established through transgenic overexpression of oncogenic Kras, are sufficient to drive CP and ADM. 14 This effect is mediated through RAS activation of NF-\u03baB signaling, which propagates a feed-forward signaling loop promoting chronic inflammation. 15 We and others have demonstrated that endogenously expressed mutant Kras requires EGFR to achieve sufficient RAS activity to induce ADM and tumorigenesis. 16,17 We also observed that pharmacologic inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) is sufficient to block KRAS-driven ADM and subsequent tumor formation, 17 whereas MEK inhibition of established pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia induces acinar cell redifferentiation. 18 Taken together, these data strongly support a key role for KRAS-MEK signaling in the formation and maintenance of pancreatic preneoplasia.",

            "text": "In contrast to tumorigenesis, the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in the induction and persistence of pancreatitis in the absence of oncogenic Kras is less wellelucidated. Pancreatitis is marked by an influx of macrophages that can release cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and RANTES driving ADM by activation of NF-\u03baB. 8 In addition, alternatively activated macrophages promote the activation of pancreatic stellate cells, further enhancing the fibroinflammatory response. 19 It has been postulated that stromally derived cytokines and growth factors are primarily responsible for driving acinar cell damage and ADM. 8 However, expression of EGFR ligands and EGFR activation is commonly observed in human CP, and in mice, parenchymal ablation of either EGFR or ADAM17, the primary EGFR ligand sheddase, prevents ADM and the stromal response in a cerulein model of pancreatitis. 17 These data collectively suggest that MEK signaling in epithelial cells, downstream of EGFR activation, is required for initiation of pancreatitis, including ADM and the fibroinflammatory response. The possibility that MEK activity is important for maintaining ADM suggests that MEK inhibitors may offer a treatment strategy for CP in human patients, for which there currently are no effective alternatives. 2 Here we have determined that inhibition of MAPK signaling in cerulein-induced pancreatitis by treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib blocked CP development. Furthermore, short-term trametinib treatment of established pancreatitis restored exocrine tissue and dramatically reduced inflammation and fibrosis. However, inhibition of MEK interfered with the restorative capacity of the organ by blocking cell proliferation. With longer-term trametinib treatment, loss of organ regeneration was even more pronounced. By using short hairpin (sh) RNA mouse models individually targeting both major MEK isoforms, we found that parenchyma-specific knockdown of MEK blocked pancreatitis-induced ADM and the associated inflammation and fibrosis. Together, these data show that MEK signaling is a potent driver of the overall pancreatitis phenotype and is required for limited organ regeneration.",

We also found that parenchymal ablation of EGFR or ADAM17 blunted all aspects of experimental pancreatitis. 17 However, in each of these models, EGFR signaling was chronically inhibited before disease onset, preventing us from examining acute effects. Here we set out to explore the feasibility of acute MEK inhibition as a potential treatment for CP. First, we performed immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated extracellular signalregulated kinase (pERK) on a human pancreas tissue microarray that included normal and CP samples ( Figure 1A) to determine whether MEK activity is potentially relevant to human CP. Ten of 12 CP samples showed pERK positivity in the epithelia and 12 of 12 in stromal cells. In contrast, 2 of 56 normal pancreas samples showed pERK positivity in the epithelia and 4 of 56 in the stroma. This ERK activity may be a result of being normal tissue in close proximity to cancer.",

V-CP mice had ~70% loss of acinar cell area, defined by area positive for amylase by immunohistochemistry ( Figure 1E), compared with saline controls. Loss of acinar cells was accompanied by gain of a picrosirius-positive fibrotic stroma ( Figure 1F), rich in inflammatory cells. Pancreata from T-CP animals had dramatically more amylase-positive acinar tissue compared with vehicle control, as well as significantly less fibrosis. The fibroinflammatory response and acinar dropout correlated to organ atrophy associated with CP, with V-CP pancreata losing 60% of their relative pancreatic mass compared with saline control ( Figure 1G). In contrast, T-CP mice lost only 35% of relative pancreas mass compared with saline control. There were no apparent differences in the tissue of mice treated with trametinib or vehicle in the absence of cerulein ( Figure 1H).",

MEK1 and MEK2 have been shown in several other systems to have some non-redundant functions, [20][21][22][23][24][25] and we found prominent ERK activity in both the epithelial and stromal compartments in human CP ( Figure 1A). To more precisely dissect the contributions of the MEK proteins, we generated mice in which we could conditionally and independently knock down expression MEK1 and MEK2 isoforms in vivo. Mice containing shRNAs targeting Map2k1 or Map2k2 (shMEK1, shMEK2) were cloned under the control of a Tet operator and knocked in downstream of the Col1A1 locus. These mice were crossed with mice harboring a Cre-dependent tetracycline transactivator in a background with the pancreasspecific Ptf1a Cre/+ . The shMEK1 and shMEK2 lines were also interbred to allow simultaneous knockdown of both MEK isoforms (Figure 2A). Doxycycline-induced expression of shRNAs resulted in an effective knockdown of the targeted isoform with no cross reactivity, whereas the shMEK1/2 mice demonstrated a loss of expression of both isoforms ( Figure 2B). Potent knockdown of the target MEK isoform was observed with 72 hours of doxycycline treatment, with the greatest level of knockdown achieved with 1 week of treatment ( Figure 2C). The specificity of the shRNA expression was confirmed to be confined to the pancreas of mice harboring all the required transgenes by fluorescent imaging ( Figure 2D). Importantly, there was no discernible effect on the normal pancreas from the knockdown of any of the genes or the expression of a control shRNA targeting Renilla luciferase (shRen713) ( Figure 2E).",

It has also been suggested that MAPK inhibition mitigates the acute effects of cerulein-induced pancreatitis. 26 To test whether either trametinib treatment or knockdown might be affecting cerulein signaling itself, we examined the effect of MEK blockade on acute pancreatitis. Mice were pretreated with trametinib or vehicle as before and then concurrently with a cerulein regimen that would induce acute pancreatitis ( Figure 5A). The acute cerulein treatment resulted in several hallmarks of acute pancreatitis including edema, necrosis, and an increase in serum amylase ( Figure 5B and C) regardless of inhibitor treatment. The shRNA mice and control mice were treated with doxycycline and subjected to the same acute pancreatitis protocol ( Figure 5D). After similar trametinib treatment, cerulein-treated shMEK1/2 mice showed necrosis and edema and demonstrated no difference in serum amylase levels compared with cerulein-treated shRNA or control mice ( Figure 5E and F). These data indicate the initial response of the acinar compartment to cerulein is not blocked by MEK inhibition through either systemic or parenchymal-specific means.",

First, we induced CP in WT mice with cerulein and then continued cerulein treatment together with either trametinib or vehicle ( Figure 6A) or withdrew them from cerulein treatment entirely to allow recovery ( Figure 6B). Western blotting confirmed that MAPK activation was reduced in the trametinib-treated group compared with the vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 6C). Trametinib treatment was sufficient to restore a significant amount of acinar tissue, with 80% of the amylase-positive area compared with the recovered cohort, whereas the vehicle-treated mice had less than 50% of the recovered control ( Figure  6D and E). Trametinib treatment also reduced fibrosis compared with vehicle-treated controls and dramatically lowered the number of macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells ( Figure 6D and F). However, in trametinib-treated mice the relative mass of the pancreas did not reach to the same size as the recovery group ( Figure 6G), suggesting that MEK activity was required not just for maintenance of ADM but also for the tissue regenerative function of ADM. We confirmed that trametinib treatment induced acinar cell redifferentiation by using qRT-PCR analysis for acinar cell differentiation markers, compared with vehicletreated mice. However, transcript levels of the ductal marker Krt19 remained unchanged between the 2 groups.",

            "text": "Our data to this point were consistent with MEK inhibition driving the redifferentiation of acinar cells from ADM. However, ADM is known to be highly proliferative, 6 presumably contributing to the restoration of organ mass. Therefore, reversing the metaplastic state before sufficient proliferation or blocking epithelial proliferation globally regardless of differentiation status may prevent the pancreatic regeneration that would normally follow cessation of the damaging insult. To determine whether MEK inhibition blocks the proliferative capacity of the epithelium, we treated mice with cerulein for 1 week to establish a modest pancreatitis phenotype and then treated the mice with trametinib or vehicle for 48 hours to investigate the early effects of MEK inhibition. To track proliferation, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered 4 hours before death ( Figure 7A). Inhibition of MAPK activation was verified by Western blot ( Figure 7B), and BrdU incorporation was measured by immunohistochemistry ( Figure 7C). Indeed, levels of BrdU incorporation were significantly higher in vehicle-treated animals compared with trametinib-treated mice ( Figure 7D). In addition, RNA transcript levels of several acinar markers increased while the levels of Krt19 decreased in the trametinib-treated group ( Figure 7E), which is consistent with the hypothesis that MEK activity is required for both proliferation and maintenance of the ADM differentiation state. Further analysis by using coimmunofluorescence for Ki67, as a marker of proliferation, the acinar cell marker carboxypeptidase A, and the ductal marker CK19 revealed that proliferative capacity of both the epithelial (positive for either) and the stromal/inflammatory compartments (negative for both) was reduced by MAPK inhibition (Figure 7F and G). The consequences of anti-proliferative effects of MEK inhibition were more profound with longer-term cerulein treatment with MEK inhibition (7 days of cerulein followed by 14 days of combined cerulein and trametinib or vehicle), resulting in an even more severe loss of pancreatic mass (Figure 8).",

The shRNA expressing mice treated with cerulein demonstrated significant recovery of acinar mass and decreased levels of fibrosis compared with mice lacking shRNA expression ( Figure 9D and E). This was also accompanied by a loss of macrophage and neutrophil infiltration; however, there were more T cells in the mice expressing shRNA under cerulein treatment compared with the recovery group ( Figure 9F-H). Inhibition of MAPK activation in the doxycycline-treated mice was verified by Western blot for pERK ( Figure 9I), whereas the induction of expression of acinar markers and loss of Krt19 expression were verified by qRT-PCR ( Figure 9J).

Whole tissue lysate was harvested from either untreated mice or mice treated with cerulein to establish pancreatitis, then concurrently treated with cerulein in combination with trametinib or vehicle ( Figure 10A), and then examined by using a mouse cytokine array ( Figure 10B). Among the cytokines detected in the array, the proinflammatory cytokines CXCL1, TNF-\u03b1, MCP1, ICAM1, IL1a, IL16, IL23, CXCL12, CSF1, as well as the canonically negative regulators TIMP1 and IL1-ra, were increased in CP and downregulated by trametinib treatment. With the cytokine array results as a guide, we used qRT-PCR analysis to confirm a significant reduction in expression of many proinflammatory cytokines in mice treated with trametinib after establishment of pancreatitis ( Figure 10C) and in mice treated with trametinib before the induction of CP ( Figure 11A). The RNA expression levels of many of these cytokines were also suppressed in doxycycline-treated shMEK1/2 mice after the establishment of pancreatitis ( Figure 10D and E) or knockdown of MEK1 and MEK2 before cerulein treatment compared with Ptf1a Cre/+ control mice ( Figure 11B). Together, these data suggest that MEK inhibition, either systemically or in the parenchyma, prevents the establishment of the proinflammatory cytokine-rich microenvironment that exacerbates the fibroinflammatory response associated with CP ( Figure 10F), disrupting ADM/inflammatory cell reciprocal communication in pancreatitis.",

Our earlier studies on the importance of EGFR activity in pancreatic tumorigenesis strongly implicated EGFR/ KRAS/MEK/ERK signaling in the very earliest stages of tumor formation, 17 including those processes also associated with CP such as ADM. Here we show that MEK signaling is required not only for the initiation of the metaplastic process and the associated fibroinflammatory response but also for maintaining the transdifferentiated, metaplastic state. These observations closely mirror data implicating MAPK signaling in both the initiation and maintenance of metaplasia in the chief cells of the stomach epithelium, 27 illustrating a commonality in the role of MAPK signaling on the plasticity of Mist1 expressing serous exocrine cells in different organs. 28 Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of MEK activity consistently led to a larger population of amylase-positive acinar cells, decreased fibrosis, and an attenuated inflammatory response after the onset of pancreatitis. However, despite the amelioration of the common characteristics of pancreatitis pathology, chronic MEK inhibition also prevented the restoration of pancreatic mass that would be associated with legitimate healing.",

            "text": "It has previously been demonstrated that the MAPK signaling pathway is upregulated in response to damage and required for adaptive pancreatic growth. 29,30 Our data further suggest that the MEK-ERK signaling axis is also an important part of the pancreatic wound healing process, similar to what has been observed in the regeneration of other gastrointestinal systems. Injury to the gastric mucosa results in activation of ERK in an EGFR-dependent manner, initiating the proliferation and migration necessary to begin the wound healing process. 31,32 Furthermore, the EGFR ligand HB-EGF has also been demonstrated to play an important role in intestinal restitution after ischemia in a manner requiring both the MEK-ERK and PI3-kinase pathways downstream of EGFR signaling. 33 The wound healing process can also be viewed in the context of tissue regeneration from a progenitor population. In Drosophilla EGFR-MAPK signaling is required for intestinal stem cells to regenerate the midgut epithelium after bacterial infection. 34 EGFR and Notch pathways also cooperate to initiate proliferation and differentiation of gastric stem cells in response to injury. 35 However, unlike the intestine, the pancreas lacks a confirmed adult stem cell population. The proliferative nature of ADM compared with normal acinar or duct cells, together with the ultimate recovery of an acinar cell population after experimental pancreatitis, has led to the hypothesis that ADM is involved in the limited tissue regeneration observed on resolution of the damaging insult. 4,6 However, several studies suggest other sources of restored acinar cells after injury, including proliferation of other mature acinar cells, 5 proliferation and differentiation of centroacinar cells, 36 transdifferentiation of a duct cell subpopulation, 37,38 or expansion of a rare DCLK1-positive cell population. 39 Here we show that MEK inhibition after induction of pancreatitis blocks cell division, yet it increases the relative acinar cell population, suggesting that the precursors of these new acinar cells are preexisting rather than being derived from the proliferative expansion and differentiation of a small subpopulation of cells. The lack of regeneration seen in response to systemic MEK inhibition can also be, at least in part, a direct effect of MEK inhibition preventing macrophage recruitment and/or polarization, an important component of pancreatic regeneration. 40 None of these possibilities are mutually exclusive, but our data support a model where metaplastic ducts have the capacity to redifferentiate into acinar cells and that MEK activity is required for maintaining their metaplastic state.",

However, unlike experimental models of pancreatitis where the entire organ is simultaneously affected by the damaging agent, human CP usually manifests as a relatively localized region of sometimes severe damage and inflammation. Although MEK inhibition may prevent tissue regeneration in the afflicted region of the pancreas, we have found no adverse effects of short-term MEK inhibition on the normal pancreas. As such, the potential to resolve the pathology of the affected region, including the inflammation, without compromising the majority of the organ suggests some promise for MEK inhibition in the treatment of pancreatitis.",

The shRNA and Ptf1a +/Cre explant cultures were treated with 10 \u03bcg/mL doxycycline hyclate (Sigma-Aldrich). WT acinar explants were treated with 100 nmol/L trametinib or dimethyl sulfoxide. After 3 days (Ptf1a +/Cre and shRNA mice) or 5 days (WT mice) of culture, the ratio of acinar to ductal conversion was counted by a blinded observer as an average of ten \u00d720 fields on a CKX41 light microscope (Olympus, Waltham, MA).",
