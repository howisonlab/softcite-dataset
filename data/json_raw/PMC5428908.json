The purpose of this study was to determine if the seasonal variations in serum total 25(OH)D are followed by a concomitant variation in free 25(OH)D or if the variation is damped by alterations in the binding capacity of DBP. Methods: Serum was collected from 540 healthy blood donors (60% men; mean age 41 \u00b1 13 years) during 12 months and analyzed for total 25(OH)D, directly measured free 25(OH)D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and albumin. Calculated free 25(OH)D was estimated. Results: The UV-B radiation during the sampling month was positively correlated with the serum levels of total 25(OH)D (r = 0.355, P < 0.001), directly measured free (r = 0.336, P < 0.001) and calculated free 25(OH)D (r = 0.275, P < 0.001), but not with DBP and albumin. The percentage of free 25(OH)D was higher during the winter months than that during the summer months (0.020 \u00b1 0.005% vs 0.019 \u00b1 0.004%; P = 0.007) and higher in participants with a serum 25(OH)D below 25 nmol/L than that in participants with a serum 25(OH)D above 75 nmol/L (0.031 \u00b1 0.007% vs 0.017 \u00b1 0.003%; P < 0.001). iPTH was correlated with directly measured free 25(OH)D (r = \u22120.226; P < 0.001), but only weakly with calculated free 25(OH)D (r = \u22120.095; P = 0.027). Conclusions: Directly measured free serum 25(OH)D was highly correlated with total serum 25(OH)D and followed the same seasonal variation, whereas the serum concentrations of DBP and albumin were stable. The fluctuation in free 25(OH)D was only marginally damped with an increase in the percentage of free 25(OH)D during the winter months and in participants with vitamin D deficiency."

Vitamin D3 is mainly produced in the skin after ultraviolet radiation, but smaller amounts of vitamin D2 and D3 are also obtained via food. To be activated, the prohormones undergo hydroxylation in two steps; firstly in the liver to become the pro-hormone 25 To assess a persons' vitamin D status, 25(OH)D is the metabolite that is measured in serum (1). Being a highly hydrophobic molecule, most circulating 25(OH)D is bound to either vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) (88%) or albumin (12%) and only a small fraction, less than 1%, circulates in a free unbound form (2). 25(OH)D binds with high affinity to DBP, but with lower affinity to albumin. The albumin-bound fraction of 25(OH)D plus free fraction has therefore been referred to as the bioavailable fraction of 25(OH)D (3,4).",

A problem with the calculation of the free concentration is that the DBP levels are not constant, but can vary in conditions such as pregnancy, liver cirrhosis, kidney disease and malnutrition (9). The concentrations of DBP and its' binding affinity for the vitamin D metabolites also vary among different populations depending on the polymorphism in the expression of the three different DBP isotypes (6,10). Lower DBP concentrations have been observed in African-Americans compared with European-Americans when DBP was measured with an immunoassay using monoclonal DBP antibodies, but not when measured with a mass spectrometry or immunoassays using polyclonal DBP antibodies (11,12,13,14,15).",

We found that directly measured free serum 25(OH)D was highly correlated with total serum 25(OH)D and followed the same seasonal variation, whereas the serum concentrations of DBP and albumin were stable. The fluctuation in free 25(OH)D was only marginally damped with an increase in the percentage of free 25(OH)D in participants with vitamin D deficiency and during the winter months, reflecting DBP ability to act as a reservoir for 25(OH)D. Our findings of stable concentrations of serum DBP during the year are supported by one earlier study from 1981 (17). The free hormone hypothesis states that proteinbound hormones are inactive and that only the free unbound fraction of a hormone can enter the cells and exert its biological effects (18,19). In the case of vitamin D, the pro-hormone 25(OH)D must enter the cells to be \u03b1-hydroxylated to 1,25(OH) 2 D. In the kidney, the intracellular uptake of 25(OH)D mainly occurs by megalin-mediated endocytosis of 25(OH)D bound to DBP and the uptake of 25(OH)D is thus facilitated by DBP (20). Megalin expression has also been found in other tissues such as the mammary glands, parathyroid gland, epididymis, lung and the placenta (21). Most other tissues are however dependent on the direct diffusion of the free unbound vitamin D forms through the cell wall and data suggest that DBP may actually have an inhibitory effect on 25(OH)D uptake here (7,22). The seasonal variation in the concentration of free 25(OH)D shown in this study may thus have importance especially for extra-renal tissues, such as the immune cells.",

Directly measured free 25(OH)D also showed a stronger correlation with serum iPTH, indicating that directly measured free 25(OH)D more adequately reflects the biologic activity of vitamin D compared with the calculated free 25(OH)D. The same findings and conclusion were reported by Schwartz and coworkers in an earlier study (10). In addition, we found that directly measured 25(OH)D better reflected DBP's ability to moderate the variation in free 25(OH)D by increasing the percentage of free 25(OH)D in situations of vitamin D deficiency and decreasing it in times of abundance. Based on these results, we consider the use of directly measured free 25(OH)D to be of greater value than the calculated free 25(OH)D. The discrepancies found between calculated and directly measured free 25(OH)D may be explained by that the affinity of 25(OH)D for DBP and albumin is not constant but varies depending on access to 25(OH)D and between individuals.",

Blood donors are a selected population of healthy individuals, and the results of the study may therefore not be representative of the general Swedish population. Gothenburg is situated at northern latitude, where the UV-B irradiance is too low during the winter months to allow the photolysis of vitamin D. As a result, the study may not be representative for populations living at southern latitudes. The measuring of free hormone concentrations has difficulties. The percentage of total 25(OH)D, which exists in free form is very low, and the assay needs to be highly sensitive and specific to avoid cross-reactivity. Furthermore, the relationship between the free fraction and the proteinbound fraction may not be the same in in vitro as in vivo. The method used to measure free 25(OH)D in the current study needs further evaluation. Total 25(OH)D was measured with CLIA and not with the gold standard method liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Serum DBP was assessed with ELISA using a monoclonal antibody specific for DBP. Recent studies have found that this method has problems detecting the DBP variant GC1f, which is common in populations of African descent. In the present study, no assessment of DBP genotype was done. The study population was however of European ancestry, where the GC1f genotype is rare, so the use of a monoclonal ELISA should not have had any great impact on our results. Another study limitation was that serum estrogen in the premenopausal women was not measured on a standardized day of the menstrual cycle."

The percentage of free 25(OH)D was also positively associated with BMI (r = 0.206, P < 0.001). When using calculated free 25(OH)D in the formula for the percentage of free 25(OH)D (calculated serum free 25(OH)D/serum total 25(OH)D) the free percentage was significantly larger (0.032 \u00b1 0.013%; P \u2264 0.001), as expected. The correlation with total serum 25(OH)D was also weaker (r = \u22120.134, P = 0.002) and the value of the percentage of free 25(OH)D of calculated free 25(OH)D increased less in vitamin D deficiency ("

Further serum DBP was positively correlated with SHBG and hsCRP and weakly negatively correlated with BMI. Serum DBP was also positively correlated with serum levels of total 25(OH)D and negatively correlated with calculated free 25(OH)D) and iPTH, whereas no correlation with directly measured free 25(OH)D was found. Linear regression was run with serum DBP as outcome and the following parameters as covariates: sex, age, BMI, use of contraceptives and the serum levels of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, iPTH, SHBG, testosterone and estradiol. In this analysis, serum DBP remained independently and significantly associated with serum SHBG (B = 0.472, s.e. = 13.792, P < 0.001), total serum 25(OH)D (B = 0.395, s.e. = 0.129, P = 0.002) and iPTH (B = \u22120.370, s.e. = 0.183, P = 0.043)."
