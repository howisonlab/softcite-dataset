This translocation is observed in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML M6), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and malignant lymphoma. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, the four and a half LIM domain protein 2 (FHL2) was identified as a CALM interacting protein. Recently, high expression of FHL2 in breast, gastric, colon, lung as well as in prostate cancer was shown to be associated with an adverse prognosis. The interaction between CALM and FHL2 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase-pulldown assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The FHL2 interaction domain of CALM was mapped to amino acids 294-335 of CALM. The transcriptional activation capacity of FHL2 was reduced by CALM, but not by CALM/AF10, which suggests that regulation of FHL2 by CALM might be disturbed in CALM/AF10positive leukemia. Extremely high expression of FHL2 was seen in acute erythroid leukemia (AML M6). FHL2 was also highly expressed in chronic myeloid leukemia and in AML with complex aberrant karyotype. These results suggest that FHL2 may play an important role in leukemogenesis, especially in the case of AML M6.",

            "text": "The AF10 gene was first identified as the fusion partner of MLL in AML patients carrying a t(10;11)(p12;q23) translocation. 6 AF10 codes for a 1027-amino-acid-long putative zinc-finger transcription factor. The Drosophila homolog of AF10, alhambra, has been suggested to play a role in heterochromatin-mediated transcriptional silencing. 7 We could recently show that AF10 interacts with Ikaros, an important regulator of lymphoid development, and that CALM/AF10 influences the subcellular localization of Ikaros. 8 The CALM gene is located on chromosomes 11 band q14 and encodes a 652-amino-acid-long protein. CALM is ubiquitously expressed and homologous to the neuron-specific clathrin assembly protein AP180. 9 CALM is mainly located in the cytoplasm and along the membrane in clathrin-coated pits. 9 CALM does also shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, permitting CALM and the nucleolar protein CATS to interact. 10 CALM promotes the assembly of clathrin into clathrin cages and takes part in the initial stage of clathrin-coated pit formation and invagination together with clathrin, AP-2 and PtdIns(4,5) P 2 . 9,[11][12][13] Both overexpression and downregulation of CALM have been shown to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and impair the trafficking of receptors between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. 9,12 Interestingly, point mutations in the mouse CALM homolog Picalm were shown to cause abnormalities in hematopoiesis, iron metabolism and bone growth. 14 The CALM/AF10 fusion protein has been shown to be strongly leukemogenic. It causes an aggressive acute leukemia in a murine bone marrow transplantation model 15 and leads to the development of acute leukemia in a transgenic mouse model after a median latency of about 12 months. 16 To study the function of CALM and the CALM/AF10 protein, we searched for protein interaction partners of CALM using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) approach. The four and a half LIM domain protein 2 (FHL2) was identified as one of several CALM interacting partners. FHL2 has been shown to be involved in several important cellular processes like transcriptional regulation, DNA replication and signal-transduction pathways. 17 FHL2 plays an important role in Wnt signaling. 18,19 Recently, high expression of FHL2 has been associated with adverse prognosis in breast and prostate cancer, [20][21][22] and high expression of FHL2 is found in ovarian and gastrointestinal cancer. 23,24 In this study, we show that FHL2 interacts with CALM and that it is highly expressed in acute erythroid leukemia (AML M6), suggesting an important role for FHL2 in leukemogenesis, especially in the development of erythroleukemia.",

            "text": "To learn more about the interaction between CALM and FHL2, colocalization experiments were performed. YFP-CALM, YFP-CALM/AF10 and YFP-FHL2 were transiently expressed in the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS (Figures 4a-i). YFP-CALM is localized mainly in the cytoplasm (Figures 4a and b), as is YFP-CALM/AF10 (Figures 4d and e). In contrast to YFP-CALM, the CALM/AF10 protein is enriched in speckles in the cytoplasm (Figure 4e). These cytoplasmic speckles might be CALM/AF10 protein inclusions in clathrin-coated pits due to disturbed endocytosis or because of an altered solubility of the CALM/ AF10 protein. YFP-FHL2 is expressed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Figures 4g and h). When FLAG-FHL2 was coexpressed with YFP-CALM, the distribution of YFP-CALM changed with more YFP-CALM found in the nucleus (compare Figures 4b and k). However, the distribution of FHL2 did not change noticeably upon co-expression of YFP-CALM (compare Figures 4h and l). There was also colocalization of YFP-CALM and FLAG-FHL2 in the nucleus and especially in the cytoplasm (Figures 4j-m), as it can be visualized in line scan images in Figure 5a. When FLAG-FHL2 was co-expressed with YFP-CALM/AF10 (Figures 4n-q), the subcellular localization of YFP-CALM/AF10 did not change markedly (compare Figures 4e and  o), but there were pronounced changes in the cytoplasmic localization of FLAG-FHL2 (compare Figures 4h and p), which colocalized with YFP-CALM/AF10 in distinct cytoplasmic speckles (Figures 4n-q). The colocalization of FLAG-FHL2 and YFP-CALM/AF10 was also clearly visible in the line scans of the confocal images (Figure 5b). The same pattern of colocalization of CALM/AF10 and FHL2 was also observed when a FLAGtagged CALM/AF10 and YFP-FHL2 fusion protein were coexpressed ( Figures 4r-u and 5c).",

Expression of GAL4-DBD-FHL2 resulted in a 40-fold activation of the reporter gene. Co-expression of YFP-CALM and GAL4-DBD-FHL2 reduced the FHL2-mediated activation from approximately 40-to 20-fold ( Figure 6a). However, co-expression of YFP-CALM/AF10 had no effect on FHL2-mediated activation (Figure 6b). One explanation for this result could be the fact that the AF10 portion of CALM/AF10 contains an activating domain (see Figure 6c) that over-rides the repressive effects seen with YFP-CALM. Interestingly, when CALM/AF10 was expressed as a GAL4-DBD fusion (GAL4-DBD-CALM/AF10), a strong transcriptional activation of about 50-fold over background of the reporter gene was seen (Figure 6c). Co-expression of FLAG-FHL2 led to a threefold reduction of the CALM/AF10-mediated activation (Figure 6c).",

In contrast to many other leukemia-associated fusion genes (for example, AML1/ETO), expression of CALM/AF10 leads to the development of an acute leukemia with a latency of only 9 weeks in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. 15 One of the critical domains in the CALM/AF10 fusion protein that is required for malignant transformation is the octapeptide/leucine zipper domain in the AF10 portion of the fusion, which interacts with the histone methytransferase DOT1L. 31 The octapeptide/leucine zipper domain is also critical for the transformation potential of MLL/ AF10 fusion. 32 However, much less is known about the domains in CALM that contribute to the transforming potential of the CALM/AF10. We therefore used a Y2H approach to identify CALM protein interactors. Using the N-terminal 408 amino acids of CALM as bait, a member of the FHL subfamily of LIM-only proteins, FHL2, was identified as a protein interactor of CALM. FHL2 interacts with proteins belonging to different functional classes, including nuclear receptors, structural proteins, transcription factors and cofactors, splicing factors, DNA replication and repair enzymes, metabolic enzymes and signal transducers. 17,30,[33][34][35][36][37][38] The FHL2 interacting domain in CALM was mapped to amino acids 294-335 of CALM. The N-terminal domain (aa 22-138) of CALM contains the ANTH domain, which specifically binds to lipids (PtdIns(4,5)P 2 ) in the plasma membrane. 11,[39][40][41] The threedimensional structure of the N-terminal 280 amino acids of CALM has been solved and consists of 10 a-helices, which aggregate to form a globular protein. 11 The C-terminal half of CALM, on the other hand, has most likely a poorly ordered structure that contains multiple short protein interaction motifs, FHL2 interacts with CALM and is highly expressed in acute erythroid leukemia Z Pa\u0161aliae et al functioning like a flexible 'fishing line'. 42 This composition of CALM permits the establishment of interactions during clathrincoated pit assembly. 40 Interestingly, FHL2 binds to b-integrin, 43 which together with clathrin, a major binding partner of CALM, has been shown to be involved in endocytosis. 9,44 Taken together, these data suggest a role for the CALM-FHL2 interaction in the complex interaction network in endocytosis. The notion that FHL2 and CALM may act together in the cytoplasm in the endocytic machinery is supported by the fact that the expression of YFP-CALM and FLAG-FHL2 in U2OS cells result in colocalization of both proteins in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane. In addition, CALM and FHL2 also colocalized in the nucleus of the U2OS cells, suggesting a nuclear function for these proteins. FHL2 has previously been shown to be localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. [45][46][47] Our immunofluorescence experiments with YFP-tagged FHL2 and FLAG-tagged CALM/AF10 showed that CALM/AF10 was located mainly in the cytoplasm, while the FLAG-tagged FHL2 was predominantly seen in the nucleus. Interestingly, a minor fraction of the FHL2 also colocalized with CALM/AF10 in distinct spots in the cytoplasm and there was a pronounced change in the distribution pattern of the cytoplasmic FHL2 when CALM/AF10 was co-expressed with FHL2 colocalizing with CALM/AF10 in distinct speckles in the cytoplasm. We suggest that these speckles might be inclusions of CALM/AF10 into clathrin-coated pits due to CALM/AF10-induced aberrant endocytosis. CALM/AF10 may tether its interaction partners into these endocytic vesicles and thereby disturb their physiological function.",

            "text": "FHL2 interacts with transcription factors like SKI and the promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger protein (PLZF). PLZF has been shown to be a transcriptional repressor with a role in the control of cellular proliferation and Hox gene regulation, 48,49 and FHL2 has been shown to enhance PLZF-mediated repression. 50 PLZF is involved in the PLZF/RARa translocation found in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. 51 Through the interaction with PLZF, FHL2 may mediate the activation of Hox genes by CALM/AF10, which was previously observed in patient samples and murine models. 31,52 Interestingly, the FHL2 interactors FOXO1 and SIRT1 37 link FHL2 to the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, which interacts with AF10 and CALM/AF10 and methylates histone H3 at lysine 79. CALM-AF10-positive patient samples and cell lines show marked histone H3 K79 hypomethylation. 53 Therefore, CALM/AF10 may strongly influence the levels of H3K79 methylation by interacting with both FHL2 and DOT1L; however, it will be very challenging to understand the complex interplay between these multiple interacting proteins involved in the regulation of histone marks. The SKI-FHL2 interaction potentiates the function of b-catenin in melanoma cells, inducing proliferation, cell cycle alterations and tumor progression. 54 FHL2 is also a crucial member of the transmembrane glycoprotein EpCAM's signaling complex, which regulates transcription in the nucleus through its association with components of the Wnt signaling pathway, like b-catenin and Lef1. 55 Figure 6 (a) CALM inhibits FHL2-dependent activation of transcription. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing GAL4DBD, GAL4DBD-FHL2 and YFP-CALM, a luciferase reporter plasmid and a Renilla luciferase control plasmid as indicated. The bars indicate fold activation of luciferase activity compared to GALDBD. Four independent experiments with three measurements per sample were performed. The error bars represent standard deviations. The firefly luciferase values were normalized to the Renilla luciferase values. (b) CALM/AF10 does not inhibit FHL2-dependent activation of transcription. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing GAL4DBD, GAL4DBD-FHL2 and YFP-CALM/CAF10 and a luciferase reporter plasmid as indicated. Cotransfection of YFP-CALM/AF10 did not have a significant influence on the transcriptional activation mediated by GAL4DBD-FHL2. (c) FHL2 inhibits CALM/AF10-dependent activation of transcription. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing GAL4DBD, GAL4DBD-CALM/AF10, YFP-CALM/AF10 and a luciferase reporter plasmid as indicated. In this setting, GAL4DBD-CALM/AF10 is a strong transcriptional activator. A threefold reduction of the GAL4DBD-CALM/AF10-mediated transcriptional activation is observed when FLAG-FHL2 is co-expressed. Three independent experiments were performed and measured in duplicate.",

Interestingly, this was not the case. The transcriptional activation mediated by FHL2 was inhibited by CALM, but not by CALM/AF10, suggesting that the CALM/AF10 fusion protein might interfere with a physiological negative regulatory role of CALM on the function of FHL2. In other words, CALM/AF10 might change the function of FHL2 and this could be an important mechanism in CALM/AF10-induced leukemia. In particular, the loss of FHL2 inhibition by CALM may potentiate the enhanced proliferation of myeloid progenitors that was observed upon forced expression of FHL2 in murine bone marrow cells. 56 One of the characteristics of AML with complex aberrant karyotypes is the frequent loss of chromosome 5 as well as a high incidence of TP53 deletions and/or mutations, resulting in an overall unfavorable prognosis. 57 Interestingly, Qian et al. 56 showed that therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and AML characterized by a loss of a whole chromosome 5 or a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (\u00c05/del(5q)) showed elevated FHL2 expression levels. Another characteristic of AML with complex aberrant karyotypes is the frequent loss of chromosome 7 that is also associated with adverse prognosis. 58 Figure 8 Expression of FHL2 in samples from patients with AML with complex aberrant karyotypes, AML M6 and AML with normal karyotypes. FHL2 microarray expression levels from 308 AML. Group 1 consists of 167 AML patients with normal karyotypes of all FAB subtypes, except M6, group 2 consists of 115 samples from patients with AML with complex aberrant karyotypes, and group 3 contains 26 samples from patients with AML M6. FHL2 is significantly higher expressed in patients with AML M6 than in AML patients with a normal karyotype or in patients with complex aberrant karyotypes (P \u00bc 2.2 \u00c2 10 \u00c016 and P \u00bc 9.967 \u00c2 10 \u00c010 , respectively). A significant difference in the expression of FHL2 was found between AML patients with normal karyotype and patients with AML complex karyotype with a P-value \u00bc 1.04 \u00c2 10 \u00c012 . Figure 9 FHL2 is highly expressed in patients with AML M6 karyotype. FHL2 expression was determined using qRT-PCR in 45 AML patient samples. High expression of FHL2 was observed in patients with AML M6 in comparison to patients with complex or normal karyotype (P-value: 0.000). No statistical significance was discovered between AML patients with complex karyotype and patients with normal karyotype (P-value: 0.685). The data are presented as fold change in gene expression compared to the gene expression of AML patients with normal karyotype. Figure 7 Expression of FHL2 in leukemia patient samples. FHL2 is expressed at higher levels in CML and AML with complex aberrant karyotype. A microarray analysis was performed on 129 patient samples and 10 normal bone marrow (nBM) samples. The boxplots depict the expression levels of FHL2 in nBM, CML, CALM/AF10positive leukemias, in seven different AML subtypes (AML_nk: AML with normal karyotype; AML_comp: AML with complex aberrant karyotype; AML_MLL: AML with an MLL rearrangement; AML_M4: AML with CBFB/MYH11 fusion; AML_M3: acute promyelocytic leukemia with a PML/RARA fusion; AML_M2: AML with an AML1/ ETO fusion; AML_FLT3: AML with normal karyotype and with an fmslike tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication), and four ALL subtypes (ALL_Ph: ALL with BCR/ABL fusion; ALL-MLL: ALL with an MLL rearrangement; ALL_BA: c-ALL: (common ALL) and ALL: pro-B-ALL). Each group is composed of 10 patient samples, except the ALL-MLL patient group, which contains 9 samples. Expression intensities are depicted on a logarithmic scale. The median of the distribution is indicated by a bar. The box presents 50% of the expression values in that group and is called the interquartile range (IQR). An expression value is considered an outlier when it lies more than 1.5 IQR lower or higher than the first or third quartile, respectively. Outliers are represented as circles. The smallest and largest values that are not outliers are indicated by a vertical tic mark or 'whisker', which is connected to the box via a horizontal line. If the notches of the boxes do not overlap between two groups, there is evidence that the medians are significantly different between the groups.",

Although analyzing the expression levels of FHL2 in patients with monosomy 5 or del(5)(q), five patients with very high FHL2 expression levels were noted (data not shown). Three of these outliers had erythroleukemia (AML M6) and two had AML M4. When we performed a new analysis using the FHL2 expression data from all available M6 patient samples, a significantly higher FHL2 expression in patients with AML M6 was discovered. Erythroid leukemia has a poor prognosis. 59 These results are in line with reports that high expression levels of FHL2 in breast and prostate cancer have recently been shown to be associated with an adverse prognosis. [20][21][22] Interestingly, we could recently show that the expression levels of another member of the FHL family, namely FHL1, correlated closely with a poor prognosis in cytogenetically normal AML. 25 Early erythroid cells are characterized by an increased expression of FHL2 (GNF Expression Atlas 2 Data from U133A and GNF1H Chips; http://www.genome.ucsc.edu). Thus, the observed overexpression of FHL2 could be only a marker of the erythroid lineage. Additional experiments are required to determine the causes and/or consequences of elevated FHL2 expression levels in erythroid leukemia.",
