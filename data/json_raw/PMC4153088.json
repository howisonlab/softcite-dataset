The present study is the first to investigate the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the relative risk of prostate cancer. We also explored the usefulness of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in a non-Mediterranean population. FFQ data were obtained from 1482 incident prostate cancer patients and 1108 population-based controls in the Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden (CAPS) study. We defined five MDS variants with different components or using either study-specific intakes or intakes in a Greek reference population as cutoff values between low and high intake of each component. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk of prostate cancer for high and medium v. low MDS, as well as potential associations with the individual score components. No statistically significant association was found between adherence to the Mediterranean diet based on any of the MDS variants and prostate cancer risk (OR range: 0\u202296-1\u202219 for total prostate cancer, comparing high with low adherence). Overall, we found little support for an association between the Mediterranean diet and prostate cancer in this Northern European study population. Despite potential limitations inherent in the study or in the build-up of a dietary score, we suggest that the original MDS with study-specific median intakes as cutoff values between low and high intake is useful in assessing the adherence to the Mediterranean diet in non-Mediterranean populations.",

The general features of this diet are high intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans, cereals and lean fish, together with high consumption of olive oil, moderate consumption of alcohol (especially wine with meals) and low amounts of milk and red meat. Several of these individual food items, or the nutrients they contain, have been associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer (4) . Based on previous knowledge about the effect of Mediterranean dietary components, Trichopoulou et al. (5) estimated that shifting to a traditional Mediterranean diet could prevent up to 10 % of the prostate cancer cases in Western high-income countries.",

            "text": "Several dietary scores have been developed to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet (6) . In 1995, Trichopoulou et al. (7) developed the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) based on eight dietary components: the intake of vegetables, fruits and nuts, legumes, cereals, meat, dairy products and alcohol, as well as the ratio of MUFA to SFA. Fish was added as a ninth component in 2003 (8) . The MDS and several modified versions have been used in epidemiological studies of various health outcomes, both in Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean populations (6,9,10) . An important component of the traditional Mediterranean diet is olive oil, resulting in a high ratio of MUFA to SFA. Outside the Mediterranean region olive oil is consumed less frequently, and the intake of MUFA is not only considerably lower, but mainly originates from a higher meat intake rather than from vegetable oils. In an attempt to adapt the MDS for use in non-Mediterranean populations, the fat ratio component has been modified so as to include both MUFA and PUFA in the numerator (11,12) . Moreover, the cut-off value between high and low intake for each MDS component is the median intake in the population under study. However, using the median intake in a non-Mediterranean study population may be questionable, as the intake of certain components may be much lower or higher than that in a typical Mediterranean population. Thus the score may be less able to discriminate between intake levels that are beneficial or non-beneficial to health.",

Cases were 35-79 years old at enrolment, from January 2001 to September 2002, and lived in the central and northern parts of Sweden. For 95 % of the cases, clinical data were obtained from the National Prostate Cancer Registry. Advanced cases were defined as those meeting at least one of the following criteria: tumour, nodes, metastasis stage T3/T4 or N1 or M1; Gleason score 8-10; or serum prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis \u2265100 ng/ml. Localised cases were defined as those with T1/T2, N0, M0, Gleason score 2-6 and prostate-specific antigen <20 ng/ml. Cases with Gleason score 7 who did not meet the criteria for advanced disease were included in neither advanced nor localised cases due to the difference in aggressiveness seen for Gleason 3 + 4 compared with Gleason 4 + 3 (16) . Controls were selected randomly from the Swedish Population Registry every 6 months, being frequency-matched to cases by age in 5-year categories and region of residence. Invitations to participate were sent out to eligible controls about once a month, except July and August, to reflect the continuous enrolment of cases.",

The main score, denoted as MDS-gram, is based on nine components: a high ratio of MUFA and PUFA to SFA (MP:S); high vegetable intake (including tomato juice, ketchup and root vegetables, except potatoes); high intake of fruit, nuts and seeds; high legume intake; high cereal intake; high fish and seafood intake; low intake of dairy products; low intake of meat and meat products (including poultry); and moderate alcohol intake. Frequencies of intake from the questionnaire were translated into intakes in g/d using standard portion sizes (26) . All intakes were energy-adjusted by dividing the actual food intake by the individual's total energy intake and multiplying by 10 460 kJ (equivalent to 2500 kcal) (7) . A score of zero or one was assigned to each component using the median intake among the controls in g/d as cut-off between low and high intake. For beneficial components (the first six listed previously), one point was given for intakes at or above the median and zero points otherwise. For the milk and meat components, one point was given for intakes below the median and zero points otherwise. For alcohol (ethanol), one point was given for intakes above zero and below the median intake, and zero points otherwise. A total score ranging from zero to nine points was calculated by summing up the scores of the individual components. The total score was then categorised into low (zero to three points), medium (four to five points) or high (six to nine points) adherence to the Mediterranean diet based on the approximate tertile distribution among the controls.",

A few studies looking at empirically derived dietary patterns have shown an increased risk of prostate cancer with 'Western' dietary patterns rich in meat and processed foods (31)(32)(33) , i.e. foods consumed at low amounts in the traditional Mediterranean diet. Interestingly, Greek migrants in Australia have a lower risk of prostate cancer than men born in Australia, and they have also retained the dietary habits of their native country, as opposed to many other migrant populations (4) . Studies on the Mediterranean diet and overall cancer risk have shown inconsistent results (2,3) . A meta-analysis of data from seven cohort studies provided a pooled relative risk of cancer of 0\u202294 (95 % CI 0\u202292, 0\u202296) for a two-point increase in the MDS (9) . In a recent review, the Mediterranean diet was considered as 'probably' protective against overall cancer, albeit there is variation with regard to different cancer sites (3) .",

Also, the vegetable intake was much lower in the study population than in the Greek reference population, and thus a true detrimental effect is unlikely. We also observed positive associations between advanced disease and intakes of total alcohol and red wine, although there is limited evidence for an association between alcohol and prostate cancer (36,37,40) . Moreover, our findings of an inverse association with red/processed meat and no association with dairy products are in contrast with previous findings of an increased risk of prostate cancer for high intakes of meat and Ca, although the evidence is inconsistent (36,37,41,42) . The deviating results in our study may be explained by residual confounding or recall bias, or may be due to chance, considering that we tested multiple hypotheses. Another component of the MDS that deserves attention is the fish intake. Previous studies on the intake of fatty fish rich in n-3 fatty acids have shown inverse associations with prostate cancer (43,44) , whereas a recent meta-analysis of the total fish intake showed no association (45) . The MDS does not distinguish between fatty and non-fatty fish, which may explain the lack of association in our study.",

An inappropriate scoring method may be unable to detect a true association or may lead to misclassification of exposure. For instance, the score may be too blunt to detect a weak association with cancer since it does not capture all dietary aspects or factors unrelated to diet, or because the beneficial and non-beneficial components of the score may counter-balance each other's potential effects, leading to a null result. This is a possible explanation for the overall lack of association seen in the present study. Also, strong correlations between the score and its components may influence the discriminatory power of each individual component. In the present study, the estimated inter-correlation between all components and their correlation with the total score was low to moderate, which means that each component contributes equally to the score. An exception was the vegetable component with a relatively high correlation with the total score (r s 0\u202258); hence, it may be the dominant factor determining the score.

The main differences between our Swedish study population and the Greek reference population were the considerably lower intake of fruit and vegetables and higher dairy product intake in the former. However, the two populations differ not only in nationality but also in age, the CAPS population being older, and in the type of exposure data, the Greek data being longitudinal and prospective whereas the Swedish data were collected only once and retrospectively.

Overall, we did not find any statistically significant association with prostate cancer for any of the score variants. The non-significant increased risk of disease found with MDS-cent and MDS-greek was unexpected, as we had rather anticipated inverse associations. These results are probably driven by a high vegetable intake, as the vegetable component had the highest correlation with the total score and was positively associated with prostate cancer risk, especially advanced disease. Since overall we observed no major differences between the score variants, we suggest that the use of study-specific intakes as cut-off values in the MDS is appropriate also in non-Mediterranean populations. The usefulness of the MDS in non-Mediterranean populations is further supported by an Australian study where the MDS was found to be appropriate for the prediction of survival in both a population of Mediterranean descent (Greek-Australians) and a non-Mediterranean population (Anglo-Celts) (50) . Also, in a European multi-centre cohort study, a two-point increment in the MDS yielded risk estimates for overall cancer that were similar in men in Northern and Southern European countries (51) .",

Comparing MDS-gram and MDS-alt, which both used study-specific median intakes as cut-off values, we found no statistically significant associations for either of them, the two scores being highly correlated.

Another drawback is the fact that the FFQ assesses dietary intake 1 year prior to diagnosis, which may differ from dietary habits earlier in life, before tumour initiation. Furthermore, reverse causation bias cannot be ruled out, although men >60 years generally tend to maintain their dietary habits even after a cancer diagnosis (53)(54)(55) .",

FFQ generally underestimate total energy intake as a result of their inability to capture the whole diet. The mean and median energy intakes in the CAPS study population were considerably lower than 10 600 kJ, the recommended daily energy intake for sedentary men 61-74 years of age (56) , which could indicate an underestimation of total food intake. Since energy intake was significantly different between cases and controls, differential misclassification of exposure is possible. FFQ may also overestimate the usual intake of those food items actually asked for, leading to distorted estimates of intake (57) , and social desirability may lead to over-reporting of healthy foods and under-reporting of unhealthy foods. The validation study of an FFQ almost identical to the one used in the CAPS study showed low to moderate correlation for several food items (19) ; however, high correlation coefficients between FFQ and food records are rarely achieved (58) . Another study validating a modified MDS version assessed by an FFQ against 24-h recalls showed a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0\u202248, and the average FFQ-based score was 102 % of the recall-based score (59) . In the present study, the use of energy-adjusted dietary intake reduces the potential influence of bias due to measurement error. Besides, such errors have less influence on the ranking of individuals, which is our main objective, compared with assessment of absolute intake (57) . The potential effect of any remaining measurement error on our relative risk estimates is attenuation, which would reduce the likelihood of detecting a potentially weak diet-disease relationship (57) ; thus it may in part explain the lack of an association seen between the Mediterranean diet and prostate cancer.",

There was no evidence of an association between the continuous scores and prostate cancer, in neither logistic regression models nor restricted cubic spline regression models, except for a non-significant positive association between the total prostate cancer and MDS-cent (results not shown). Among the individual score components, a high vegetable intake was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, with multivariate OR 1\u202225 (95 % CI 1\u202205, 1\u202250; P trend = 0\u202201) for total prostate cancer, 1\u202237 (95 % CI 1\u202209, 1\u202272; P trend = 0\u2022006) for advanced disease and 1\u202225 (95 % CI 0\u202298, 1\u202260; P trend = 0\u202207) for localised disease (results not shown).
