            "text": "The stress-responsive alternative sigma factor B is conserved across diverse Gram-positive bacterial genera. In Listeria monocytogenes, B regulates transcription of >150 genes, including genes contributing to virulence and to bacterial survival under host-associated stress conditions, such as those encountered in the human gastrointestinal lumen. An inhibitor of L. monocytogenes B activity was identified by screening~57,000 natural and synthesized small molecules using a highthroughput cell-based assay. The compound fluoro-phenyl-styrene-sulfonamide (FPSS) (IC 50 \u202b\u060d\u202c 3.5 M) downregulated the majority of genes previously identified as members of the B regulon in L. monocytogenes 10403S, thus generating a transcriptional profile comparable to that of a 10403S \u232csigB strain. Specifically, of the 208 genes downregulated by FPSS, 75% had been identified previously as positively regulated by B. Downregulated genes included key virulence and stress response genes, such as inlA, inlB, bsh, hfq, opuC, and bilE. From a functional perspective, FPSS also inhibited L. monocytogenes invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells and bile salt hydrolase activity. The ability of FPSS to inhibit B activity in both L. monocytogenes and Bacillus subtilis indicates its utility as a specific inhibitor of B across multiple Gram-positive genera. IMPORTANCE The B transcription factor regulates expression of genes responsible for bacterial survival under changing environmental conditions and for virulence; therefore, this alternative sigma factor is important for transmission of L. monocytogenes and other Gram-positive bacteria. Regulation of B activity is complex and tightly controlled, reflecting the key role of this factor in bacterial metabolism. We present multiple lines of evidence indicating that fluoro-phenyl-styrene-sulfonamide (FPSS) specifically inhibits activity of B across Gram-positive bacterial genera, i.e., in both Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus subtilis. Therefore, FPSS is an important new tool that will enable novel approaches for exploring complex regulatory networks in L. monocytogenes and other Gram-positive pathogens and for investigating small-molecule applications for controlling pathogen transmission.",

Complex interactions occur between B and PrfA-dependent gene regulation (5,10); PrfA is the master regulator of L. monocytogenes virulence gene expression. B directly regulates prfA transcription via the P2 prfA promoter (11)(12)(13) and also indirectly regulates PrfA activity. Specifically, B downregulates PrfA activity in intracellular L. monocytogenes, thus moderating expression of PrfA-dependent virulence genes and thereby reducing host cell damage incurred by these virulence gene products (5).",

We screened multiple small-molecule libraries to identify an inhibitor of the stress response and virulence-associated regulator B . The most promising small molecule was further assessed using an L. monocytogenes 1H-indole-3-carboxylate [Chemical Diversity], and 5-phenyl-4,7-dihydrotetrazolo [1,5-a]pyrimidine [Maybridge])-none inhibited B activity in the bile salt hydrolase activity assay, and therefore, none were evaluated further.",

At 4 M, FPSS significantly reduced opuCA and gadA transcript levels compared to those in 10403S without FPSS (P \u03fd 0.05) but not to levels equivalent to those in the \u232csigB strain (Fig. 2). The FPSS concentration yielding half the maximal inhibition (IC 50 ) was calculated as 3.5 M for opuCA and 3.0 M for gadA. Importantly, absolute transcript levels for the housekeeping genes rpoB and gap were not different in L. monocytogenes with and without exposure to FPSS, indicating that FPSS specifically inhibits transcription of B -dependent genes without affecting transcription of housekeeping genes.",

Among these 17 genes, 9 genes were of unknown or hypothetical function. Several FPSSdownregulated genes are recognized as contributing to virulence and host infection (i.e., inlA, inlB inlD, bilEAB, bsh, hfq, clpC, opuC, and gadA). Further, the PrfA regulon (i.e., genes regulated by the pleiotropic virulence gene regulator PrfA) was significantly enriched among the genes downregulated by FPSS (FDR q \u03ed 0.095). Interestingly, 19 genes that were previously classified as coregulated by PrfA and B (10,20) were both upregulated in the mouse spleen (10) and downregulated by FPSS, further supporting their B -dependent transcription. Among these 19 genes, three were identified as potential virulence factors in murine and tissue culture models (10,22), including lmo1601 (encoding a general stress protein), lmo1602 (encoding an unknown protein), and lmo2157 (encoding SepA, a metalloprotease in Staphylococcus epidermidis [21]), which is upregulated in L. monocytogenes during intracellular infection (22). FPSS also downregulated lmo0937, a PrfA-regulated gene that is upregulated in the mouse spleen at 48 h postinfection (10), and lmo0915, which encodes a component of a phosphotransferase system identified as a potential virulence factor by Camejo et al. (10); neither gene had been identified previously as B dependent. Other B -dependent genes downregulated by FPSS and upregulated during intracellular infection (22) include lmo0232 (clpC); lmo0445, which encodes a transcriptional regulator; lmo2672, which encodes a protein similar to a transcriptional regulator; and lmo0783, which is a member of an operon encoding mannose phosphotransferase system components. FPSS-treated cells had lower transcript levels for a number of genes that encode cell wall-associated proteins previously shown to be upregulated under intracellular conditions (22) and in the murine intestine (6); these genes include inlA, inlD, lmo0610, lmo0880, and lmo2085, which all encode proteins with an LPXTG sorting motif for cell wall anchoring, and inlB, which encodes a protein with a GW domain that is important for binding host ligands (23).",

            "text": "Three genes important for glycerol utilization (i.e., lmo1538, lmo1539, and lmo1293) were also downregulated by FPSS; utilization of glycerol as a carbon source in intracellular environments (22) is required for intracellular survival (24). While lmo1538 (encoding a glycerol kinase) and lmo1539 (encoding a glycerol uptake facilitator) were downregulated by FPSS, they were previously reported to be negatively regulated by B in stationary phase and under salt stress conditions (8). Interestingly, however, both genes were upregulated by B in the intestine (6) and during intracellular replication (22). lmo1293 (glpD), which encodes a glycerol-3phosphate dehydrogenase, was previously reported to be positively regulated by B in L. monocytogenes exposed to salt stress (8) or grown intracellularly (24) and in the gastrointestinal tract (6) but was downregulated by B in stationary-phase cells (8). Taken together, our data provide additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that the composition of the B regulon is dynamically dependent on environmental conditions (7). Importantly, our data also demonstrate that a number of genes downregulated by FPSS are specifically regulated by B in the gastrointestinal environment. For example, three additional genes downregulated by FPSS (i.e., lmo0642, lmo1251, and lmo1930) had higher transcript levels in the L. monocytogenes parent strain than in the \u232csigB strain when both were grown in the murine intestine (6), but these genes did not appear to be B dependent under other in vitro conditions (5,7,8,16,17) Only a small number of genes upregulated by FPSS have been identified previously as negatively regulated by B . Overall, 32 genes were identified with significantly higher transcript levels in FPSS-treated L. monocytogenes than in untreated cells (Table 1), suggesting negative regulation of these genes by B . While 264 genes were previously identified as negatively regulated by B under at least one condition (5-8, 16, 17), only 7 of the 32 FPSSupregulated genes were represented among these 264 genes. Further, only 14 genes were previously identified as negatively regulated by B under at least two environmental conditions (5-8, 16, 17) and none of the 32 FPSS-upregulated genes were represented among these 14 genes. Very few genes appear to be consistently repressed by B under various conditions, likely because these genes are indirectly rather than directly regulated by B . Six of the 7 FPSS-upregulated genes previously identified as negatively regulated by B encode proteins with known functions, including an ABC transporter (lmo2114), a posttranslocation chaperone (prsA), a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (lmo1699 and lmo1700), NADP glutamate dehydrogenase (lmo0560), and a D-alanine-activating enzyme (dltA). While dltA (the first gene in an operon encoding proteins that modify lipoteichoic and wall teichoic acids) was previously shown to be negatively regulated by B , other genes in this operon (i.e., lmo0973 [dltB] and lmo0971 [dltD]) not previously identified as B dependent were also significantly upregulated following FPSS treatment, suggesting that this entire operon is negatively regulated by B , at least under some conditions. Two genes, lmo2568 (unknown function) and a Genes were classified with upstream B -dependent promoters by in silico analysis using a hidden Markov model as described by Oliver et al. 17.",

In addition, six FPSS-upregulated genes (lmo0678 to lmo0681, lmo0685, and lmo0686) not described previously as negatively regulated by B were located in a large flagellar biosynthesis and motility operon (lmo0673 to lmo0718) containing 13 genes recognized as negatively regulated by B (8). As transcription of a number of motility related genes was affected by FPSS, GSEA was also performed on the regulons of the known chemotaxis-and motility-related regulators DegU, MogR, and CodY. The DegU operon, as defined by Williams et al. (25), was enriched among FPSS-upregulated genes (FDR q \u03fd 0.0001); DegU is an activator of flagellum biosynthesis (26). Specific DegU-regulated genes identified among the FPSS-upregulated genes include six genes in the flagellum biosynthesis operon (lmo0673 to lmo0718) as well as the B -repressed (8) methylaccepting chemotaxis operon (lmo1699 and lmo1700) (25). The CodY regulon was also significantly enriched among FPSSupregulated genes (FDR q \u03fd 0.0001); CodY is a negative regulator of genes encoding flagellar components in L. monocytogenes (27). Although MogR, the transcriptional repressor of flagellum genes (28,29), was shown previously to be B dependent (6), its regulon (29) was not significantly enriched among the genes differentially regulated by FPSS (FDR q \u03ed 0.257).",

            "text": "By using a high-throughput screen of approximately 57,000 small molecules, 41 candidate compounds were identified as potential inhibitors of L. monocytogenes B activity. Through subsequent screens, we identified a compound designated FPSS that specifically inhibits B -mediated transcription, as shown by qRT-PCR of B -dependent genes and whole-genome microarray analysis of cells treated with the compound. This compound also significantly reduces L. monocytogenes invasion into human intestinal epithelial cells and inhibits B -directed activity in the Grampositive bacterium B. subtilis, indicating that this compound inhibits B -mediated transcription across genera. Overall, our data show that FPSS (i) inhibits expression of the B regulon with high specificity, yielding transcriptional profiles similar to those generated by a genetic null mutation of the sigB gene, and (ii) specifically inhibits expression of B -dependent genes important for virulence, stress response, and other functions associated with L. monocytogenes survival and growth in the gastrointestinal tract. In combination with previous reports that identified small molecules that interfere with virulence factors and virulence activation and that show therapeutic promise (14,31), our results suggest that, in addition to its role as a promising tool for studying regulatory networks involving B , FPSS also may represent a compound that can be developed into a therapeutic agent. FPSS specifically inhibits expression of B -dependent virulence, stress response, and other functions that are associated with L. monocytogenes growth and survival in the gastrointestinal tract. B is well recognized as an important transcriptional regulator in multiple Gram-positive genera. For example, B regulates transcription of genes contributing to stress response, virulence, or both in low-GC Gram-positive microbes, including human pathogens such as Bacillus cereus (32,33), Bacillus anthracis (34), Staphylococcus aureus (35,36), and the opportunistic pathogen S. epidermidis (37). B activates transcription of a large number of target genes across the genera and species reported to date (e.g., L. monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, S. aureus, and B. subtilis) (8,38,39). FPSS treatment of L. monocytogenes affects expression of B -dependent genes that are upregulated in the host intestine but that had not been identified previously as B dependent under other in vitro conditions. Specifically, among 172 genes in L. monocytogenes EGD-e that were upregulated by B in the murine intestinal lumen (6), FPSS treatment significantly downregulated 126 genes; 17 genes downregulated by FPSS had been identified as B dependent only in the intestinal lumen (6) but not in other in vitro test systems. Thus, identification of B -dependent genes in L. monocytogenes treated with FPSS may provide new insight into B -dependent gene regulation that may be critical during the gastrointestinal stage of infection. For example, the PrfA regulon was significantly enriched among genes downregulated by FPSS treatment, including two PrfA-dependent genes (i.e., lmo0937 and plcA) that had not been identified previously as B regulated. These findings are consistent with B 's role, via the P2 prfA promoter, in directly upregulating prfA transcription (11)(12)(13) and also support the idea that B -dependent upregulation of prfA transcription plays a critical role during intestinal stages of infection. Activation of B in the intestinal lumen thus appears to increase expression of B -dependent inlA, which is required for intestinal epithelial cell invasion (40), and also primes expression of PrfA, which is critical for regulating virulence gene expression during the subsequent intracellular stages of infection.",

Several genes in a large operon encoding flagellar structural components were previously reported to be negatively regulated by B (8), and sigB-null mutants also exhibited increased swarming (6, 8). B -dependent downregulation of transcripts encoding flagellar components and overall motility appear to be at least partially due to B -dependent transcription of a long untranslated region (UTR) upstream of mogR, which encodes a negative regulator of L. monocytogenes motility. Reduced transcription of this UTR not only reduces mogR transcript levels (thereby increasing flagellar motility) but also appears to increase transcript levels for some flagellar genes, as the B -dependent UTR also decreases flagellin gene transcripts through an antisense-RNA-type mechanism (6,8). While L. monocytogenes flagellar motility appears to contribute to intestinal invasion (41), B -dependent downregulation of flagellar expression in the intestinal lumen may be critical for subsequent stages of infection, as Listeria downregulates flagellar gene expression during infection (10) to evade the immune system; increased expression of flagellar components can induce potent proinflammatory effects via TLR5-mediated immunogenicity (42).",

By comparison, the ToxT inhibitor virstatin (14) has an MIC between 3 and 40 M, depending on the target strain. Minimal bactericidal concentrations of gentamicin, ampicillin, and streptomycin against L. monocytogenes range from 2 to 46 M (49). In addition to its promising IC 50 prior to structural optimization, FPSS produces highly specific, genome-wide reduction of B -directed activity, including inhibited expression of B -dependent virulence genes such as inlAB, bsh, bilE, clpC, and hfq (5-8, 16, 17). Furthermore, opuC (50) and gadA (51), which are important for gastrointestinal survival in the host, are also significantly downregulated by FPSS. FPSS clearly inhibits transcription of a number of genes with functions in virulence and infection, thus increasing its therapeutic potential over compounds that target only one virulence factor (43). The contributions of B to L. monocytogenes virulence are also supported by phenotypic evidence, including reduced virulence of a \u232csigB strain in a guinea pig model of infection (9) and reduced invasion of human Caco-2 cells by a \u232csigB strain (9,40), consistent with the reduced invasiveness for FPSS-treated L. monocytogenes observed here. Importantly, B also contributes to establishment of infection and virulence in other Gram-positive pathogens, including B. anthracis and S. aureus. A B. anthracis sigB mutant is less virulent than the parent strain, producing a 1-log reduction in 50% lethal dose, perhaps because B enhances the ability of B. anthracis to persist in the bloodstream of a mammalian host (34). In S. aureus, B directly and indirectly modulates global regulatory elements involved in virulence functions (52). Functional loss of B results in decreased S. aureus virulence in central venous catheterrelated diseases manifested by significantly reduced multiorgan infection (53). Similar to B. anthracis, B is suggested to promote S. aureus survival in the bloodstream, preventing clearance and allowing establishment of infection (54). Further development and optimization of FPSS thus may provide an opportunity to develop novel therapeutics for some important Gram-positive pathogens.",

Cells were grown in brain heart infusion broth (BHI; Difco, Sparks, MD) for phenotypic and transcriptional profiling assays.",

Differences in transcript levels were considered meaningful if they met the following three criteria: (i) adjusted P values of \u03fd0.05 (ii) absolute fold changes of \u05462 and (iii) a probe cross-hybridization index (CHI) of \u03fe90%. One gene (i.e., lmo0263) fulfilled criteria (i) and (ii) but not (iii) (probe CHI was 80%) and therefore was not included in our analyses.",
