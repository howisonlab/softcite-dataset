Governments strategically control labor distribution across industries, and representative agents maximize Cobb-Douglas utilities. A Nash equilibrium with complete specialization is achieved if and only if relative productivity exceeds a key value of 3, which is considered a very large number based on previous empirical studies. This paper also introduces a two-stage game where each government chooses labor distribution first and then tariffs. In this two-stage game, complete specialization is never achieved for any relative productivity level. Finally, by generalizing the Cobb-Douglas model into constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences, I show that if immiserizing growth effects exist, complete specialization could not be achieved for any level of relative productivity."

            "text": "The two most important questions in international trade are the normative question of \"why should nations pursue free trade?\" and the positive question of \"do nations have incentives to pursue free trade?\" The former question is well explained by David Ricardo, in that comparative advantage is the source of mutual benefits from world trade. This paper indicates that the answer to the second question also relies on comparative advantage; a strong comparative advantage is necessary for nations to strategically pursue free trade in a Ricardian model. Defining the degree of comparative advantage as the relative productivity between more and less competitive industries in a symmetric Ricardian model with Cobb-Douglas preferences, this paper shows that a Nash equilibrium with complete specialization is achieved if and only if the measure exceeds a key value of 3, a very large number based on previous empirical studies. This paper also shows that complete specialization cannot be achieved if the government implements import tariffs in addition to labor distribution policies, or if there exist immiserizing growth effects."

            "text": "A rational government wants to manipulate the terms of trade by protecting the less competitive sector and controlling the more competitive one. However, protectionism under strong comparative advantage results in a decrease in the domestic production size and consequently a decrease in its welfare. Therefore, a strong mutual comparative advantage should be present in order to achieve free trade. Otherwise, the government would use trade policies such as export subsidies or import tariffs. Costinot, Donaldson, Vogel, and Werning (2015) explored the relationship between comparative advantage and optimal trade taxes. Their optimal trade taxes aim to control the production size of more competitive sectors with comparative advantage to manipulate the terms of trade. 1 The difference between Costinot et al. (2015) and this paper is that the former considered import tariff and export subsidy as their strategies with a passive foreign government whereas the latter considers governments' intervention in labor distribution in a Nash equilibrium.",

In this paper, a representative agent in each country has a Cobb-Douglas utility function, which is considered to have a \"medium\" value of elasticity of substitution. 3 The elasticity of substitution derived from the utility function is the main factor in determining the equilibrium prices, or equivalently, the terms of trade. To maximize the utility of the representative agent, each government strategically determines the quantities of labor in the two industries. 4 A government's incentive for specialization primarily depends on how much the two countries have a mutual comparative advantage. To define a measure of comparative advantage, this paper introduces a symmetric model in which one country's labor productivity of its more (less) competitive industry is equal to the other country's labor productivity in the more (less) competitive industry. With the help of the symmetric structure, the measure of comparative advantage is defined as the ratio of higher labor productivity to lower labor productivity, which is equal to the relative autarky price. The main results are that (1) the degree of specialization strictly increases in comparative advantage, and (2) only if comparative advantage exceeds or equals to the number 3 would a complete specialization be achieved in a Nash equilibrium.",

            "text": "The value of relative productivity 3 is a very large number based on previous empirical evidence. Costinot, Donaldson, and Komunjer (2012) measured relative productivities across 21 countries and 13 industries based on the year 1997. 5 Normalizing all industries to the United States and in all countries for the food industry, there is no single value of relative productivity among 260 values (20 countries 3 13 industries) that is greater than 3 or less than 1/3. Among the 260 values, 253 of them are in the range of [0.5,2]. The maximum is 2.74, which is the relative productivity of the Korean chemicals industry relative to that of the United States. The minimum value is 0.49, which is the relative productivity of the Hungarian transport industry relative to that of the United States. Considering that 3 is an unrealistically large value of relative productivity, the main result in this paper may imply that it would be hard for countries to agree on free trade and complete specialization without any international organizations. 6 The model in this paper is closely related to the theory of immiserizing growth developed by Bhagwati (1958), which indicates that export-biased growth might deteriorate the terms of trade sufficiently such as to decrease the welfare of the economy. 7 In the context of the Ricardian model, export-biased growth can be interpreted as the expansion of the more competitive industry without contraction of the less competitive industry. However, the government's action on labor distribution not only has the expansion effect (i.e., immiserizing growth effect) but also the contraction effect. Therefore, this paper investigates how each effect, separately, affects the government's incentive to avoid complete specialization.",

Therefore, I extend the baseline model by including a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function with a general elasticityof-substitution parameter. With the extended model, I show that if the elasticity of substitution is lower than 0.5, which is the condition for the existence of immiserizing growth effect, complete specialization could never be achieved for any value of relative productivity. Although this paper shows that there is no immiserizing growth effect with Cobb-Douglas utility functions, the other effects (including the direct effect and terms-of-trade effects from the contraction) prevents complete specialization if the relative productivity is smaller than 3.",

            "text": "This paper also investigates how Nash equilibrium specialization is determined when governments are allowed to implement import tariffs. Specifically, I introduce a two-stage game where each government first strategically chooses labor distribution and then optimal import tariffs. This paper shows that complete specialization can never be achieved in such a two-stage game. This result of missing complete specialization is closely related to Riezman (1988, 1990), where agents are endowed with goods. The two-stage game in this paper reproduces the results of Kennan and Riezman (1990), where the optimal tariffs are a function of the endowments. Kennan and Riezman (1990) show that a more equal (asymmetrical) distribution of endowments between the two sectors results in lower (higher) tariffs and thus higher (lower) utility in a Nash tariff war. In the two-stage game, \"endowments\" are endogenously chosen by the government's strategic action on labor distribution. Governments know that if they choose more specialized labor distribution, which implies a more asymmetrical endowment distribution in Kennan and Riezman's (1990) model, it will end up with the Nash equilibrium with higher tariffs and thus lower utilities. To avoid this destructive tariff war under asymmetrical endowment distribution, governments would have incentives to avoid specialization of labor distribution in the two-stage game. The main results of this paper support this logic, as it shows that the degree of specialization under the two-stage game is strictly lower than that under the onestage game.",

Once the labor distribution is fixed, this model is the same as Riezman (1988, 1990), in which agents are endowed with goods. The main result of this section is that complete specialization in this two-stage game is never achieved for any degree of comparative advantage. This result is related to Kennan and Riezman's (1990) finding that a more asymmetrical distribution of endowments between export and import sectors results in higher tariffs and lower utilities. Because asymmetrical distribution implies a high degree of specialization in the model, governments would try to deviate from complete specialization to avoid severe tariff wars.",

This is because as country A's degree of specialization is higher, country B's tariff policy is more effective in decreasing the world price of country A's export good. To avoid country B's tariff attacks, country A would strategically choose less specialized industry composition. In this symmetric model, the same logic can be applied to country B.

This paper also investigates how immiserizing growth effects are related to incomplete specialization in a CES framework. From the stylized model, this paper shows that the existence of immiserizing growth effects is the sufficient condition for missing complete specialization. Finally, this paper introduces a two-stage game where governments choose labor distribution and then optimal tariffs. In this two-stage game, complete specialization is never achieved for any degree of comparative advantage. All of these results imply that it would be difficult for countries to agree on free trade without any help from international organizations."

            "text": "The alternative explanation for incomplete specialization might be a commodity-aggregation problem. While 1-or 2-digit Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) results in a smaller degree of complete specialization across countries, finer digit levels (such as 3 or 4 digits) show different patterns. For example, both the United States and China have strong manufacturing export industries but the United States is more specialized in transportation equipment while China is more specialized in electronic equipment. Another explanation for the missing complete specialization could be from the Ricardo-Viner model, in which there are immobile factor endowments such as land and capital. In contrast to the classical Ricardian model where labor productivity is constant, the marginal return of labor decreases as the quantity of labor input increases in the Ricardo-Viner model. This diminishing marginal-return effect prevents countries from completely giving up their less competitive industries."

            "text": "Another remaining question is how the elasticity of substitution between export and import goods affects the Nash equilibrium of specialization. The main reason why countries avoid specialization is that they want to improve the terms of trade through strategic labor distribution policy. Therefore, it is expected that for lower elasticity of substitution values, complete specialization is difficult to achieve, as shown in Section 6. However, under perfect substitutes utility, i.e., U\u00f0x; y\u00de5x1y, it is apparent that the Nash equilibrium with complete specialization would be achieved for any degree of comparative advantage, because the prices are not affected by labor distribution in this case."

For Nash tariff wars, see Johnson (1950), Gorman (1958), Kennan and Riezman (1988), Gros (1987), Syropoulos (2002), Zissimos (2009), and Ogawa (2012). For Nash quota wars, see Rodriguez (1974) and Tower (1975). For strategic environmental regulations, see Barrett (1994), Kennedy (1994), Burguet and Sempere (2003), and Bhattacharya and Pal (2010). 5 The list of 13 industries is food, textiles, wood, paper, fuel, chemicals, plastic, minerals, metals, machinery, electrical transport and manufacturing not elsewhere classified. The list of 21 countries is Australia, Belgium-Luxembourg, Czech Republic, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States. The measures of relative productivity are computed using relative producer prices from the Groningen Growth and Development Centre (GGDC) Productivity Level Database. See Inklaar and Timmer (2008) for details. 6 Depending on the choice of a country for normalization rather than the United States, some relative productivities might exceed 3. However, considering U.S. markets share the largest portion in the world economy, using the United States as the standard country would be most appropriate. 7 Also see Bhagwati and Johnson (1960), Bhagwati (1968Bhagwati ( , 1969, and Bhagwati et al. (1984). 8 Once the representative agent's smooth preferences are revealed, comparative advantage can be interpreted as differences in relative autarky prices between the two countries. Because of Cobb-Douglas utility functions, the measure of comparative advantage based on relative autkary prices is identical to that based on relative productivity. 9 See the proof in Appendix (A5). 10 The Metzler paradox can also explain why the two countries have a mutual destructive tariff war under complete specialization. The relative domestic price of the foreign good under complete specialization is",

This is the Metzler paradox, in which the imposition of a tariff on imports decreases the relative internal price of that good. Under the paradoxical price changes, an increase in tariff will necessarily increase real purchasing power for domestic consumers. 11 The Matlab code is downloadable in mwkang.site11.com/code/rie2016. 12 The Ricardian model introduced in this paper has a combination of effects that include expansion and contraction, so it is not obvious whether the condition oEX(a,a 0 )/oa < 0 clearly represents the immiserizing growth effect. To clarify this issue, it is worth presenting a simple model of endowment economy. With the same CES utility functions as in Equation 18, country A's endowment for good (x, y) is ffiffi ffi k p a; 0 \u00c0 \u00c1 and country B's endowment is 0; ffiffi ffi k p a 0 \u00c0 \u00c1 . In this endowment economy, there exists closed form solutions for the equilibrium allocations, and the condition for country A's welfare to decrease as a increases is that E < 0.5 for any value of a 0 > 0, a ! a 0 , and k > 0, which is the same as the condition in Equation (21).",
