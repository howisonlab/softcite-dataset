The insight into the dividend puzzle in the CEE companies, provided in the research, gives an overview of the dividend yields and payment stability as well as the relationship between the dividend payments and the type of ownership. Main findings of the study prove that the highest yield and the highest payout ratio are obtained in the case of strategic investor acting as a major shareholder (>10% of ownership capital). Binary logistic regression results provide the possibility to forecast whether the company will pay dividends. The typical dividend payer should not have family/management as a major investor, the ownership still should be concentrated and the investor preferably should be of local origin.",

The problems of the dividend payouts, its determinants, its stability are widely discussed in the financial management resulting in the numerous empirical and theoretical papers. Signaling theory, which gains importance within the modern capital markets, can provide certain hints for the dividend puzzle: the dividend announcements almost always are followed by the firm's price increase, while the announcements about the dividend reduction have a significant negative reaction on the stock price (Koch, Shenoy 1999;Lee, Xiao 2003;Guttman et al. 2007;Hussainey, AalEisa 2009;Fairchild 2010). When the dividends are being initiated or raised the management signals about the quality of earnings, about earnings stability and sustainability, which is the main concern of the firm's shareholders. Financial managers deciding on the dividend increase focus on maintaining stable or increasing earnings aiming to sustain smooth dividend stream (Lintner 1956;Skinner 2004;Brav et al. 2005;DeAngelo et al. 2006).",

It should be noted that both of the regressions ap pear to be significant due to the high F test values, despite the fact that adjusted R in the case with the dividend yield regression model is 2.5% and in the case with the dividend payout regression model it is 9.6% (Tables 3, 4).

All largest inves tors in the CEE companies were classified according to their type (financial, strategic, government, family/mana gement, free float) and according to their origin (local and foreign). These ownership structures were used as dummy variables in the regression equation to find out the signifi cance of their relation to the firm's dividend policy, which is primarily reflected in the dividend payout ratio. Besides, the authors considered also the dividend yield as a depen dent variable to find out if a retail investor can base his investment decision also on the ownership type to receive the highest return in the form of dividends, which might become very crucial in the current low yield environment. The research on 117 CEE listed companies shows that the most generous companies in terms of dividend payouts are those, which have strategic investors or government as major owners. Highest dividend yields are also seen in the investment case of the strategic owners, however, govern mentowned companies are catching up. Evidently for these investors today's cash flows are not sacrificed to get higher cash flows in the future. One of the explanations might be that these companies are in their life cycle 4, when they have very good cash flows, they are leaders in their niches and have limited investment opportunities. It is worth noticing that the companies, where the major owners are the finan cial investors, whose primary investment goal is financial benefit, exhibit rather low dividend yields and payout ratios.",

First, the company has to be of the tangible size, which is usually the common case not only for the emerging markets, but also for the developed markets. Second, the company should not have family/ma nagement investor in the ownership structure, which can be explained by the family's willingness to invest for the future rather than to distribute the profits now. Third, it should not have a dispersed ownership -there still has to be one major owner (above 10% of ownership capital structure), who will exert certain influence on the profit distribution decisions. Fourth, the major investor should be of local origin.",
