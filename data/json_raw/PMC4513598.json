No published studies have validated its use in the native knee and the post-unicompartmental replacement knee (UKR). We quantified the difference in measurements obtained from CTS and LLR for knee alignment.",

The mechanical and anatomical axes of the tibio-femoral joint were measured. Bland-Altman plots were used to calculate the 1.96 standard deviation limits of agreement between CTS and LLR. Intraclass correlation was used to assess intra-rater and inter-rater reliability (where values > 0.81 indicate very good reliability).",

CTS is severely limited by being a non-weight bearing modality in addition to having the same limitations as LLR (i.e. influence of rotational malalignment and flexion deformity). Brouwer et al. (2003) compared standing and supine LLR, but patients were excluded if they were unable to stand on one leg, if they had had previous surgery, or if they had a clinical malalignment. Gbejuade et al. (2014) compared CTS and LLR after TKR; however, weight bearing may not be as important a factor in measurement of alignment after TKR.",
