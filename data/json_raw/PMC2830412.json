In order to determine whether or not MLE evidences any chemopreventive activities, experimental lung metastasis was induced via the i.v. inoculation of colon26-M3.1 carcinoma cells into BALB/c mice. Additionally, we attempted to characterize any possible cytotoxic effects in murine normal splenocytes and tumor cells (B16-BL6 and colon26-M3.1). The total phenolic content and reducing capacity were measured at 39 mg/100 mL and 1.24, respectively, whereas the DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities of MLE were measured to be 88.89% and 22.10%, respectively. Prophylactic i.v. treatment with MLE resulted in a dose-dependent and significant inhibition of lung metastasis. Specifically, a MLE dose of 200 ug per mouse resulted in an 88.90% inhibition of lung metastasis. For the cytotoxicity assay, MLE doses up to 100 ug/mL were not shown to affect the growth of normal murine splenocytes. Additionally, the survival of normal cells was not affected at MLE doses below 500 ug/mL. However, MLE doses up to 500 ug/mL reduced the percentage of tumor cell growth for B16BL6 (67% alive) and colon26-M3.1 (62% alive) cells.",

Mosidae has been traditionally utilized in Korea as a Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for the treatment of certain diseases including expectoration, chills, fever, poisoning, and phlegm discharge [10]. The principal constituents of Mosidae leaves (ML) are the organic acids, saponin and inulin, and unlike individual constituent crude drugs its efficacy and quality can be altered. Additionally Mosidae has also been reported to exert antioxidant effects [11] in a few in vitro and in vivo studies [12]. However, the anti-metastatic effects of Mosidae have yet to be clearly elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the antioxidant activity of Mosidae leaves ethanol extract (MLE) which was extracted with 70% ethanol solution in water bath at 30\u2103 for 1 hour, by assessing its reducing power, total phenolic compounds, DPPH radical scavenging activity, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. We also evaluated the anti-metastatic activity of MLE through the prophylactic inhibition of lung metastasis of colon26-M3.1 carcinoma cells. The cytotoxic effects of MLE were evaluated using an experimental metastasis model featuring murine splenocyte and tumor cells (B16BL6 and colon26-M3.1).",

The moisture content of the fresh ML was 91.92%, the protein content of fresh ML was 1.63%, the fat content was 0.04%, and the ash content of fresh ML was 0.6%. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that the production of reactive oxygen species underlies a variety of disorders, and is also responsible for cellular damage [20]. The reducing capacity of cellular damage may be a significant indicator of any potential antioxidant activity [21]. Accordingly, MLE might contain a sizable amount of reductant, which may react with free radicals to stabilize and terminate free radical chain reactions. In this study, the reducing capacity of MLE was similar to that of vitamin E, but less profound than that of BHT. Phenolic compounds are thought to perform important functions as dietary antioxidants for the prevention of oxidative damage in living systems. Cho [22] reported that tannins extracted from fresh ML harbored high levels of total phenolic compounds as compared with spinach and aster, and moreover exhibited high DPPH radical scavenging activities. In this study, the total phenolic content of MLE was 39 mg/100 mL. The DPPH assay is known to provide reliable information concerning the antioxidant potential of a particular compound [23]. The results in Table  3 show that the DPPH radical scavenging activity of MLE is similar compared with \u03b1-Tocopherol and BHT. Kim et al. [10] did report the DPPH radical scavenging activity of fresh MLE (55.63%), which was lower than the value we reported (88.89%). However, such a difference could have been caused by the different cultivation conditions in our experiments. For instance, the samples utilized in this study were cultivated by the environmentally-friendly agricultural company, Eco-Sprout Co, Ltd.",

MLE may prove to be useful in preventing lung tumor metastasis, because it appears to exert no additional side effects. Therefore, MLE may be useful in the development of new plant materials as CAMs against diseases whose principal pathology is oxidative stress.",
