The purpose of this study was to investigate the location and metastatic rate of the arm node, and to evaluate the short term incidence of lymphedema after arm node preserving surgery. Methods: From January 2009 to October 2010, 97 breast cancer patients who underwent ARM were included. Blue-dye (2.5 mL) was injected into the ipsilateral upper-inner arm. At least 20 minutes after injection, SLNB or ALND was performed and blue-stained arm nodes and/or lymphatics were identified. Patients were divided into two groups, an arm node preserved group (70 patients had ALND, 10 patients had SLNB) and an unpreserved group (13 patients had ALND, 4 patients had SLNB). The difference in arm circumference between preoperative and postoperative time points was checked in both groups. Results: The mean number of identified blue stained arm nodes was 1.4\u00b1 0.6. In the majority of patients (92%), arm nodes were located between the lower level of the axillary vein and just below the second intercostobrachial nerve. In the arm node unpreserved group, 2 patients had metastasis in their arm node. Among ALND patients, in the arm node preserved group, the difference in arm circumference between preoperative and postoperative time points in ipsilateral and contralateral arms was 0.27 cm and 0.07 cm, respectively, whereas it was 0.47 cm and -0.03 cm in the unpreserved group; one case of lymphedema was found after 6 months. No difference was found between arm node preserved and unpreserved group among SLNB patients. Conclusion: Arm node preserving was possible in all breast cancer patients with identifiable arm nodes, during ALND or SLNB, except for those with high surgical N stage, and lymphedema did not develop in patients with arm node preserving surgery.",

The metastatic arm node of the second patient was not a common lymphatic channel, but rather an extranodal extension with N3 metastasis. She had stage IIIC (T1, N3, M0); the histologic grade was 3 with lymphovascular invasion, and markers for ER, PR, and HER2 were all negative. The arm node of this patient was removed and she had lymphedema after 6 months.",

Since then, various reports have been introduced [8,11,[13][14][15][16], but there are some key issues that need to be resolved in arm node preservation. First, the rate of arm node identification by blue dye staining is somewhat insufficient. Second, there are reports of metastasis in arm lymph nodes or in the lymphatic pathway. This raises problems regarding the safety of arm node preservation surgery. Third, common lymphatic channels are found between SLNs and arm lymph nodes. When a common channel exists, even SLNB can cause lymphedema. Fourth, the stained blue arm node may be juxtaposed to the metastatic lymph node, which could result in direct invasion of the carcinoma and make it difficult to save the arm node.",

We included only patients whose arm node was identified. Therefore, patients who had ALND were more frequently included than those who had only SLNB. Average time to detection for the arm node was 19.2 \u00b1 13.5 minutes. During the operation, about 10 minutes after blue dye injection, we could find hardly any blue-stained arm nodes. When injected intravenously, the plasma half-life of methylene-blue dye has been reported as 5-6.5 hours [19,20]. However, the pharmacokinetics of methylene-blue dye in the lymphatic system and lymph nodes has not been well studied.

The arm node was localized in the lateral pillar of the axilla, and it was always found above or at the level of the second intercostobrachial nerve [11]. In our study, 97% of nodes were located between the lower level of the axillary vein and the second intercostobrachial nerve. To identify the arm node, an important landmark in the operative field is the axillary vein and the second inter-costobrachial nerve. The metastatic arm nodes were found in the inferomedial and inferolateral sides, one by each side, and the arm node of the patient who developed lymphedema was found in the inferomedial side. If more patients were included, statistical analysis would be possible, and the relationship between the location and metastasis of arm nodes would be identified.",

            "text": "For assessment of lymphedema, there are many methods such as measurement of arm circumference, water displacement, self-assessment, bioimpedance spectroscopy and perometry [12,[22][23][24][25][26]. Measurement of arm circumference, used in our study, is simple and inexpensive, so it is routinely used in many studies as the method. In the ALND group, the absolute change in arm circumference before and after the operation was 0.27 \u00b1 1.19 cm in the arm lymph node preserved group and 0.47 \u00b1 0.85 cm in the unpreserved group; the difference was not statistically significant. However, the arm lymph node preserved group showed a tendency towards less change in arm circumference than the unpreserved group. When making comparisons between arm circumferences in the ipsilateral upperextremity of the arm node preserved group and unpreserved group, according to the formula introduced by McLaughlin et al. [12], there was no significant difference. But in the ALND group, the arm circumferences changes of the arm node unpreserved group were bigger than the preserved group (0.51\u00b1 1.07 vs. 0.20\u00b1 0.83, p= 0.081). There were no cases of lymphedema in 70 patients in whom the arm node was preserved during ALND, but there was 1 case of lymphedema in 13 patients in whom the arm node was resected during ALND. To verify the efficacy of arm lymph node preservation in preventing lymphedema, more patients should be included and longer follow-up periods are needed. We defined lymphedema as a measurement change of > 2 cm during the follow-up period, but, self-assessed symptoms are also important. Although measurement change was less than 2 cm, if the patient feels discomforts, she may have lymphedema. In a future study, we should check patient's subjective symptoms. There was no significant change in arm circumference in the SLNB only group, and it was difficult to determine the efficacy of arm lymph node preservation because of the small number of patients. There was no axillary recur-rence during the follow-up period in patients who underwent arm node preserving surgery. But, oncologic safety should be observed, always. Further studies about actual regional recurrence in preserved arm nodes are needed. In practical terms, arm node preserving surgery gives no advantage to patients with a cross-over node or N0, but does benefit patients with N1 and N2. Standard SLNB is not indicated in patients with N1 or N2, but SLNB should be done to preserve the arm nodes in these patients.",
