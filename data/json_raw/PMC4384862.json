            "text": "Assessment of the energy expenditure of walking is frequently performed to evaluate the effectiveness of walking systems (1). The standard method for estimating energy cost is the direct measurement of oxygen consumption (VO 2) but it is generally unavailable in the clinical setting. The Physiological Cost Index (PCI) first was introduced by MacGregor 1 as method based on linear correlation between VO 2 and heart rate (HR) (2). It requires simply recording of HR at rest and while walking, measured by not expensive equipment. Measuring the PCI has been the subject of many publications for patients with different locomotion disorders (3-6) and also in lower limb amputees walking with prosthesis (7-10). We undertook this study aiming to present the efficacy of rehabilitation program for subjects with lower limb amputation, for over ten years after the implementation of this program in Kosovo (11, 12). Our aim was to assess energy cost and walking speed in two level amputation: transfemoral and transtibial amputation as most important determinants of efficacy of prosthetic walking respectively of prosthetic rehabilitation program. Also we aimed to analyze wherever the age and prosthetic walking supported with walking aids had impact on energy cost and walking speed. 2. METHODS This was a prospective cross sectional study. The research covered the period from the first of January to the first of July, 2012. 2.1. Subject population A convenience sample of individuals with amputations was recruited among patients at the Department of Prosthetics and Orthotics at the University Clinical Center of Kosovo. Inclusion criteria were to have: 1) above 18 years of age; 2) unilateral lower limb amputation, for reasons other than vascular disease; 3) at least one year experience of using prosthesis; 4) no cognitive disorders or other significant medical conditions. All gave informed consent. All trans-femoral amputees used modular (endoskeletal) prosthesis with quadrilateral socket, 4-bar linkage knee with mechanical swing phase control; or polycentric knee joint and SACH-foot. Transtibial amputees used a modular patellar tendon bearing socket and SACH-foot. The subjects wore their prostheses almost all day for ordinary activities. 2.2. Measurements PCI is calculated as the quotient of difference in working ABSTRACT Background: The Physiological Cost Index (PCI) was introduced by MacGregor to estimate the energy cost in walking of healthy people, also it has been reported for persons with lower limb amputation, walking with prosthesis. Objective: To assess energy cost and walking speed in two level lower limb amputation: transfemoral and transtibial amputation and to determine if the age and prosthetic walking supported with walking aids have impact on energy cost and walking speed. Methods: A prospective cross sectional study was performed in two level lower limb amputees with no vascular disease who were rehabilitated at the Department of Prosthetics and Orthotics at the University Clinical Center of Kosovo. The Physiological Cost Index (PCI) was assessed by five minutes of continuous indoor walking at Comfort Walking Speed (CWS). Results: Eighty three lower limb amputees were recruited. It is shown relevant impact of level of amputation in PCI (t=6.8, p<0.001) and CWS (T=487, p<0.001). The great influence of using crutches during prosthetic walking in PCI (ANOVA F= 39.5 P < 0.001) and CWS (ANOVA F=32.01, P <0.001) has been shown by One Way ANOVA test. The correlation coefficient (R) showed a significant correlation of age with PCI and CWS in both groups of amputation. Conclusions: Walking with transfemoral prosthesis or using walking aids during prosthetic ambulation is matched with higher cost of energy and slower walking speed. Advanced age was shown with high impact on PCI and CWS in both groups of amputees.",

The participant had an HR monitor (OXY-100 Handheld Pulse Oximeter, 20060 Gessate (MI), Italy) attached around the chest and the receiver was attached in second finger of their hand. Before registering HR at rest, the participant was seated in silence for about five minutes and then it was recorded each minute for the following five minutes. Prior to the walking part of the test, a short distance was walked in order to warm up. The walking was conducted indoors, in a hallway with a regular floor surface. We chose a 76-m-long quadratic-shaped track with gently rounded corners (36 x 2 x 36 x 2), marked every one meter. The patients were asked to walk at their self selected comfortable speed, with the aid they normally use for support if walking continuously for a few hundred meters. Walking was carried out for five minutes with the tester walking behind to read the HR at work every 30 seconds. A digital stopwatch was used to time subjects as they walked over a track while the investigator recorded HR and walked distance. All the participants were instructed to avoid the intake of tobacco, coffee/tea or a large meal at least two hours prior to the test.",
