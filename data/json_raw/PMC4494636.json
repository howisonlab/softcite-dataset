Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary medical center to determine the prevalence of PE among adult male participants with LUTS during the Annual National Prostate Health Awareness Day. Basic demographic data of the participants were collected. All participants were assessed for the presence and severity of LUTS using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and for the presence of PE using the PE diagnostic tool. Digital rectal examination was performed by urologists to obtain prostate size. LUTS was further categorized into severity, storage symptoms (frequency, urgency, and nocturia), and voiding symptoms (weak stream, intermittency, straining, and incomplete emptying) to determine their association with PE. Data were analyzed by comparing the participants with PE (PE diagnostic tool score !11) versus those without PE, using the independent t test for continuous data, ManneWhitney U test for ordinal data, and Chi-square test for nominal data. The statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Results: A total of 101 male participants with a mean \u00b1 standard deviation age of 60.75 \u00b1 10.32 years were included. Among the participants, 33% had moderate LUTS, and 7% severe LUTS. The most common LUTS was nocturia (33%). The overall prevalence of PE was 27%. There was no significant difference among participants with PE versus those without PE in terms of age, marital status, prostate size, or total IPSS score. However, significant difference between groups was noted on the level of education (Mann eWhitney U, z \u00bc \u00c01.993, P \u00bc 0.046) where high educational status was noted among participants with PE. Likewise, participants with PE were noted to have more prominent weak stream (ManneWhitney U, z \u00bc \u00c02.126, P \u00bc 0.033). Conclusions: Among the participants consulted with LUTS, 27% have concomitant PE. Educational status seems to have an impact in the self-reporting of PE, which may be due to a higher awareness of participants with higher educational attainment. A significant association between PE and weak stream that was not related to prostate size suggests a neuropathologic association."

            "text": "Every year, the Philippine Urological Association (PUA) celebrates Prostate Health Awareness Month with National Digital Rectal Exam (DRE) Day. This is a nationwide effort to promote awareness in men regarding prostate diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. This is conducted by urologists in several participating institutions. Most of the participants come in for consultation due to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Out of 925 participants in 2013, more than half (61%) were identified as cases of LUTS, with 57% reported to have moderate to severe LUTS. 1 LUTS are common in men and have been shown to have increased frequency and severity with age. 2 Symptoms of male sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, and hypoactive desire were previously assumed to be only natural consequences of aging. 3 However, the latest evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that these symptoms are actually associated with LUTS. 2 Several community-based studies have also shown strong correlations between the prevalence of sexual dysfunction, especially erectile dysfunction, and the severity of LUTS with increasing age. 4 Premature ejaculation (PE), one of the components of male sexual dysfunction, is also seen in the elderly as a primary or secondary condition. 4 Although several studies have already defined the association between male sexual dysfunction (specifically erectile dysfunction) and LUTS, only few correlations have been made between premature ejaculation alone and LUTS. Common causes for this are poor detection of this symptom and underreporting of cases. 5 This study therefore aims to determine the prevalence of PE among adult Asian males and characterize its association with LUTS and other clinical factors.",

Nocturia is the most common symptom reported (32.7%) together with frequency (13.9%) and residual urine (13.9%). A study described that an isolated nocturia can be common, particularly in aging men, with a recent meta-analysis estimating a prevalence of 30e60% in men aged >70 years. 6 The most common prostate size in the mean age of 62.16 years is 30 g whereas 40-g prostate sizes were seen in the mean age of 63.96 years. This relates that the prostate enlarges with aging. In addition, although LUTS are sometimes associated with urinary flow and prostate size, there is substantial evidence that men can have symptoms even in the absence of enlarged prostate on physical examination. 6 This is partly because lower urinary tract symptoms can be caused by multiple mechanisms, including prostate, bladder smooth muscle tone and contractility. 6 PE was first described a century ago; however, its definition has been debatable since then due to its ambiguity. 7 The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5 2013) has defined PE using the parameter of approximately 1-min intravaginal ejaculatory latency time. The DSM-5 also listed potential exclusionary conditions to include nonsexual mental disorders, severe relationship distress or other significant stressors, and substance/medication use or other medical disorders, which may result in early ejaculations. These criteria were intended to eliminate cases of premature ejaculation resulting secondarily from psychological and/or medical factors. 7,8 The International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) in 2013 developed a definition grounded in clearly definable scientific criteria. The committee proposed an evidence-based unified definition of both lifelong PE and acquired PE. 9 The ISSM described three current questionnaires used in the diagnosis of PE; the PEDT has a modest database, and is readily available for clinical use. 5 Several studies have established the validity and reliability of PEDT that correlate well with the objective assessment by intravaginal ejaculatory latency time 10,11 ; due to its simplicity and availability, our study utilized this tool to screen the presence of PE among the participants.",

This is comparable with a study in Korea, where PEDT have diagnosed PE in 12.1% (35/290) and probable PE in an additional 11.7% (34/290). 4 It is clear that PE is highly prevalent and, globally, approximately 30% of all men can be considered to have the condition regardless of age group. 12 Similar to our study, the PE Perceptions and Attitudes Study reported that many countries did not show an increased prevalence of PE with increasing age. 13 However, according to the data of the Korean Society for Sexual Medicine and Andrology, their study demonstrated an increased PE prevalence with increasing age. 4 The same Korean study also described that there is significant correlation between LUTS and PE particularly among the age 60e79 years group (r \u00bc 0.292, P \u00bc 0.007) 4 ; however, the PEDT score among the age 40e59 years group was not correlated with storage symptoms (r \u00bc 0.327, P \u00bc 0.077) or voiding symptoms (r \u00bc 0.223, P \u00bc 0.235). 4 In congruence, our study results also showed that the storage symptoms and PE has no association (P \u00bc 0.600), as well as voiding symptoms and PE (P \u00bc 0.108).",

In particular, high education was associated with increased incidence of PE showing a significant association (ManneWhitney U, z \u00bc \u00c01.993, P \u00bc 0.046). Our study has demonstrated that educational status seems to have an impact in the self-reporting of PE of the participants, which may be due to higher awareness with higher educational attainment. It suggests that participants who are aware about the condition PE are more likely to volunteer PE symptoms. It is recommended that clinicians should always utilize the screening questions for PE to give the appropriate treatment, 5 because participants are often unwilling to volunteer their symptoms on PE. 14 The mechanism of PE requires emission that involves deposition fluid from the ampullary vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate gland into the posterior urethra 15 ; and expulsion phase that involves closure of the bladder neck, followed by the rhythmic contractions of the urethra by pelviceperineal and bulbospongiosus muscles, and intermittent relaxation of the external urethral sphincters. 16 Sympathetic motor neurons control the emission phase of ejaculation reflex, and expulsion phase is executed by somatic and autonomic motor neurons. These motor neurons are located in the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral spinal cord and are activated in a coordinated manner when sufficient sensory input to reach the ejaculatory threshold has entered the central nervous system. 17,18 Our study showed a significant association between PE and weak stream (ManneWhitney U, z \u00bc \u00c02.126, P \u00bc 0.033) that was  It may be possible that a neurologic problem causing weak bladder contraction such as neurogenic bladder may also cause PE because autonomic motor neurons for bladder contraction and ejaculation are located in the same area. A study described the possible cause of the link between LUTS, erectile dysfunction, and PE is overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased sympathetic nervous system activity. According to this hypothesis, LUTS could result from sympathetic nervous system tone, which induces the occurrence of urinary storage symptoms owing to the contraction of smooth muscles in the prostate gland and urinary bladder. Erectile dysfunction occurs as a result of smooth muscle contraction in the corpus cavernosum, whereas PE occurs as a result of smooth muscle contraction in the prostate, seminal vesicle, vas deferens, and epididymis. 4 This study was limited to a clinical based single session assessment of participants. No follow up or additional objective diagnostic examination such as a urodynamic study with sphinteric activity assessment were done to confirm the presence of and association between PE and LUTS. Therefore, a larger-scale study with follow up of participants with objective assessment and additional risk factor identification (such as body mass index, smoking status, and psychological factors) is recommended for future studies to confirm our findings and additional analyses.",
