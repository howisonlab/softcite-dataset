            "text": "von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) patients develop highly vascular tumors, including central nervous system hemangioblastomas. It has been hypothesized that the vascular nature of these tumors is the product of reactive angiogenesis. However, recent data indicate that VHL-associated hemangioblastoma neoplastic cells originate from embryologically-arrested hemangioblasts capable of blood and endothelial cell differentiation. To determine the origin of tumor vasculature in VHL-associated hemangioblastomas, we analyzed the vascular elements in tumors from VHL patients. We demonstrate that isolated vascular structures and blood vessels within VHL-associated hemangioblastomas are a result of tumor-derived vasculogenesis. Further, similar to hemangioblastomas, we demonstrate that other VHL-associated lesions possess vascular tissue of tumor origin and that tumor-derived endothelial cells emerge within implanted VHL deficient UMRC6 RCC murine xenografts. These findings further establish the embryologic, developmentally arrested, hemangioblast as the tumor cell of origin for VHL-associated hemangioblastomas and indicate that it is also the progenitor cell for other VHL-associated tumors. v on Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a progressive multi-system familial tumor syndrome characterized by phenotypically similar vascular tumors in the central nervous system (CNS) and viscera 1. Characteristic VHL neoplasms include CNS hemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), pheochromocytomas and pancreatic cystadenomas 1. VHL is caused by a germline mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25-26) 2. Tumor development occurs after loss of the wild-type allele (loss of heterozygosity [LOH]) 3-6. While this second-hit is somatic and varies between different tumors in VHL 7 , it takes place within a susceptible cell type in an at risk organ system during embryogenesis and results in a consistent tumor phenotype 8-10. Shared tumor characteristics in VHL can be attributed to a decrease in the production of functional VHL protein (pVHL) in affected tumor cells. pVHL is necessary for the degradation of hypoxia inducible factors ([HIF] HIF-1a and HIF-2a), which in response to tissue hypoxia play a significant role in cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation, as well as induction of angiogenesis and erythropoiesis through the production of downstream factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], platelet derived growth factor [PDGF], erythropoietin [EPO], and endothelin [EDN1]) 1,11-13. Data suggest that constitutively upregulated HIF activity drives the development and progression of the vascular tumors characteristically found in VHL patients 1,13. Recently, the hemangioblast cell has been identified as giving rise to VHL-associated CNS hemangioblastomas 8-10,14. Hemangioblast cells are identified by the co-expression of brachyury, Flk-1, and Scl/Tal1 15-17. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting by known hemangioblast markers (Tie2 hi c-Kit 1 CD41 2) in vitro yields both endothelial cells and erythrocytes 18,19. Moreover, VHL-associated tumor cells can evoke blood island formation and differentiate into erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo, as well as form endothelial cell progeny in vitro 8,10. These findings indicate that VHL-associated hemangioblastomas are not only capable of extramedullary hematopoiesis but potentially blood vessel development. It had been hypothesized that extensive blood vessel formation in VHL-associated tumors was exclusively the result of reactive angiogenesis within a pseudo-hypoxic (pVHL deficient) cellular environment, and secondary to HIF-induced downstream factor production (VEGF, PDGF, EPO, and END1) 1,13. However, the discovery of the multipotent hemangioblast as the neoplastic cell in hemangioblastomas suggested that de novo formation of new blood vessels directly through stem-like endothelial progenitor cells (hemangioblast cells) could play a role in"

CD31 expression, an endothelial specific cell surface marker, highlighted extensive vascular tissue within hemangioblastoma tumors (in contrast with normal cerebellum) ( Fig. 1a,b). Hemangioblastoma precursors (defined by CA9 and HIF-2a expression in the absence of HIF-1a expression) 20 were identified within regions of normal cerebellar tissue in autopsy samples from patients with VHL ( Fig. 1c,d,e). Both hemangioblastomas and precursor lesions demonstrated the presence of numerous small (10 to 50 micron diameter) unperfused CD31 expressing ring-like vascular structures, indicative of sprouting vessel development with lumen formation (Fig. 1b,f).",

Examination of 3D CD31 expression reconstruction in tumors demonstrated the formation of numerous small isolated islands of vascular tissue (10 to 50 microns) independent from the established vascular network ( Figure 1G). To further define potential differences within the vasculature of VHL-associated tumors, we analyzed hemangioblastoma-associated vessels according to size. Immunohistochemical analysis showed larger vessels (greater than 100 microns) expressed Factor VIII with or without CD31 expression, while small vascular structures almost exclusively expressed CD31. Consistent with previous studies, the absence of Factor VIII expression and pronounced CD31 expression in small vascular structures confirmed the presence of immature proliferative endothelial cells within hemangioblastoma tumors ( Fig. 2a)  21 .",

Dissected vascular elements demonstrated marked allelic imbalance, confirming LOH (Fig. 2b,c). Blood cell samples and large tumor feeding vessels did not exhibit LOH ( Fig. 2c). To further confirm this result, FISH with concurrent CD31 immunofluorescence was carried out on hemangioblastoma sections to detect the presence or absence of VHL itself. Endothelial cell nuclei within larger vessels (100 microns) displayed retention of both copies of VHL (Fig. 2d). Alternatively, small vascular elements (10 to 50 microns) showed one copy of VHL, indicating loss of the wild-type allele ( Fig. 2e,f,g). Complementary LOH and FISH data served to verify that tumor-derived vasculogenesis was taking place within evaluated hemangioblastoma tumors. Large vascular structures also demonstrated some endothelial cells with loss of one copy of VHL, consistent with migrating endothelial cells that were recruited during angiogenesis combining with developing de novo endothelial cells during tumor blood vessel formation.",

UMRC6 xenografts presumably demonstrated characteristic VHLassociated tumor phenotype with extensive vascularity and clear-cell appearance ( Fig. 3d,e). Small vascular structures developing within xenograft lesions were identified by CD31 staining and extracted by micro-dissection ( Fig. 3f). Micro-dissected structures demonstrated human genomic (DNA) marker after amplification with VHL-flanking chromosome 3 specific primers (D3S1038 and D3S1110), as opposed to control murine muscle tissue that did not amplify (Fig. 3g). Co-localization by immunofluorescence of human specific HLA markers and non-specific CD31 within the xenografts further established the presence of tumor-derived endothelial cells emerging within the tumor, and indicate that the hemangioblast is presumably the tumor cell of origin in VHL-associated tumors other than hemangioblastomas (Fig. 3h,i,j,k).",

Overexpression of HIF and downstream gene activation plays an important role in tumor proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis 27 . In line with previous reports, our findings indicate that the embryologically arrested pVHL-deficient hemangioblast is the neoplastic progenitor cell in VHL-associated hemangioblastomas and that it also serves as the progenitor cell for other VHL-associated tumors (RCC). Furthermore, based upon both previous and current data, we propose that pVHL-deficient tumor cells develop and progress secondary to constitutively produced proangiogenic factors (VEGF, PDGF, EPO, and EDN1) that stimulate endothelial cell and erythrocyte differentiation, while also inducing angiogenesis within the existent tumor vascular network (Fig. 4a,b)  8,10,13 . In addition, de novo endothelial cells can combine with migrating endothelial cells recruited during angiogenesis during tumor blood vessel formation (Fig. 4c). However, at this time we cannot separate integrated tumor-derived endothelial cells from those derived during angiogenesis in terms of function. An in-depth understanding of   Immunohistochemistry staining. Tissues were fixed in Histochoice (Amresco) with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Research Products International). Detection of antibody was performed using the Vectastain ABC reagent (1550) and DAB (Vector Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). Primary antibodies were as follows: anti-CD31 (15200, Dako).",
