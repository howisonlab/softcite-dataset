            "text": "Objective: Interaction between microRNA (miR-328) and PTPRJ (protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, J) has been reported to be responsible for miR-328-dependent increase in epithelial cancer cell proliferation. However, the role of miR-328 and PTPRJ in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of miR-328 and/or PTPRJ expression in human HCC and determine their precise biological functions in this malignancy. Methods: Expression levels of miR-328 and PTPRJ messenger RNA (mRNA) in 100 pairs of HCC and adjacent noncancerous tissues were detected using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The associations between miR-328 and/or PTPRJ expression and various clinicopathological features of HCC patients were further statistically assessed. Then, the functions of miR-328 and PTPRJ in migration and invasion of two human HCC cell lines were determined by transwell assays. Results: miR-328 and PTPRJ mRNA expression levels were markedly upregulated and downregulated in HCC tissues, respectively, compared to adjacent noncancerous tissues. Notably, the upregulation of miR-328 in HCC tissues was significantly correlated with the downregulation of PTPRJ mRNA in HCC tissues (r=\u22120.362, P=0.01). In addition, miR-328-high and/ or PTPRJ-low expression were found to be closely correlated with high Edmondson-Steiner grading (all P,0.05) and advanced tumor-node-metastasis stage (all P,0.05). Moreover, the restoration of miR-328 dramatically promoted HCC cell migration and invasion by repressing PTPRJ expression. Interestingly, the loss of PTPRJ expression could significantly attenuate the inhibitory effects of knockdown miR-328 on the migration and invasion of HCC cells. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that the dysregulation of miR-328 and PTPRJ may be associated with tumor progression of HCC patients. Functionally, miR-328 may serve as a crucial oncogene and be implicated in the motility of HCC cells at least in part by the suppression of PTPRJ.",

            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent type of malignant liver cancer, has been recognized as the third leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. 1 Despite recent advances in disease management and treatment, the unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients remains unchanged, with a median survival of most patients of 6-9 months following diagnosis. 2 Especially, the overall 5-year survival rate of advancedstage HCC patients is less than 5% because of intra-hepatic metastases, extrahepatic metastases, early invasion into blood vessels, and recurrence. 3 Growing evidence based on molecular profiling of HCC shows that there are a variety of molecular signaling transduction cascades that are involved into the aggressive progression of this malignancy. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for HCC carcinogenesis, invasion, and metastasis in order to identify the deregulated genes and to develop the novel therapeutic strategies.",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a type of small conserved noncoding RNAs with approximately 17-23 nucleotides in length, function as critical gene regulators via negatively regulating the expression of target genes by translational inhibition or destabilization of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) at a posttranscriptional level. 4 In recent years, accumulating attention has been paid to the important biological and pathological roles of miRNAs because of their involvement in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell development, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, and cell cycle, which are all closely correlated with carcinogenesis and cancer progression. 5,6 Hence, it is no surprise to find that the deregulation of miRNAs is implicated in many human cancers and can function as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes in a tumor-type manner. Especially, recent studies have identified several deregulated miRNAs in HCC tissues or cells, and revealed their roles in HCC carcinogenesis and progression, providing evidence that restoration of the deregulated miRNAs might be considerable therapeutic strategies in HCC treatment. 7,8 miR-328 has been regarded as a cancer-related miRNA. Accumulating studies suggest that it may play different roles and function as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on cancer types. [9][10][11][12][13][14] In particular, Paduano et al 14 experimentally validated the direct regulatory effect of miR-328 on the mRNA levels of PTPRJ (protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, J) via binding on its 3\u2032-UTR in various cancer cells. It has been indicated that the expression of PTPRJ, a ubiquitous receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, is significantly decreased in a vast majority of human epithelial cancers and cancer cell lines. [15][16][17][18][19] However, the role of miR-328 and PTPRJ in HCC remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance of miR-328 and/or PTPRJ expression in human HCC and determine their precise biological functions in this malignancy.",

However, the molecular mechanisms of these miRNAs acting on carcinogenesis and cancer progression have not been fully elucidated. In this study, miR-328 was investigated as a deregulated miRNA in human HCC tissues. Our data confirmed the negative correlation between miR-328 upregulation and PTPRJ downregulation, which has been validated as a target mRNA of miR-328, in HCC tissues. Interestingly, we revealed that miR-328-high and/or PTPRJ-low expression were significantly associated with aggressive progression of human HCC, especially with high Edmondson-Steiner grading and advanced TNM stage. Functionally, this miRNA may act as an onco-miRNA, as it was found to be involved in the development and progression of HCC through suppressing the expression of PTPRJ mRNA. These results not only confirm the promoting effect of miR-328, but also suggest that miR-328 combined with PTPRJ might function as a potential therapeutic target for HCC. miR-328, together with let-7d* and miR18a*, has been reported as one of the multicentric HCC recurrence-related miRNAs. 22 Its oncogenic or suppressive role has been confirmed in other types of cancer. MiR-328 may represent a potential diagnostic biomarker of non-small-cell lung cancer, especially for the identification of early-stage tumors. 23 It may play an important role in maintaining cancer stem-like side population phenotype and may be a potential target for effective colorectal cancer therapy. 24 ",

            "text": "To elucidate the oncogene mechanism of miR-328 in HCC, its target genes were investigated. One such target gene was PTPRJ (also known as DEP-1, CD148, and HPTP), which maps at chromosome 11p11.2, a region involved in human tumors through loss of heterozygosity, and encodes a receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase, the expression of which is strongly reduced in the majority of investigated cancer cell lines and tumor specimens. 26,27 PTPRJ negatively interferes with intracellular signals mediated by several oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases. 28 As a ubiquitous gene, PTPRJ is extensively expressed in all the investigated tissues, including brain, thyroid, liver, spleen, and endothelial cells. Pathologically, the aberrant expression of PTPRJ has been indicated to be able to interfere with cancer cells malignant phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. The binding of PTPRJ interacting peptides to cell cultures could dramatically reduce the extent of both MAPK phosphorylation and total phosphotyrosine levels. Conversely, they could induce a significant increase in the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1. 14 Moreover, PTPRJ agonist peptides both reduce proliferation and trigger apoptosis of treated cells, suggesting that peptide agonists of PTPRJ positively modulate the PTPRJ activity and may lead to novel targeted anticancer therapies. 14 PTPRJ may promote breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis via Src activation. 26 In particular, the overexpression of miR-328 may decrease PTPRJ expression in various cancer cells and miR-328 acts directly on the 3\u2032-UTR of PTPRJ, leading to the decreased mRNA levels, in line with the results of luciferase assay and site-specific mutagenesis, which has identified miR-328 as an important player in the regulation of PTPRJ expression. 14 Because there are no previous reports on the association of HCC and PTPRJ, quantitative PCR was performed in the current study to detect the expression pattern of PTPRJ in HCC tissues. As a result, we found that PTPRJ expression was decreased in more than half of HCC patients and was negatively correlated with tumor progression. More interestingly, correlation analysis also showed an inverse correlation between miR-328 expression and PTPRJ mRNA expression, and the combined miR-328/PTPRJ expression has more significant associations with clinicopathological features of HCC patients than miR-328 or PTPRJ alone. Furthermore, the functional assay suggests that PTPRJ siRNA could attenuate the inhibitory effects of knockdown miR-328 on the migration and invasion of HCC cells.",
