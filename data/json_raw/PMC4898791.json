The method does not resort to Monte Carlo computation but instead blends Felsenstein's discrete character pruning algorithm with methods for numerical quadrature. It is not limited to Gaussian models and adapts readily to model uncertainty in the observed trait values. We demonstrate the framework by developing efficient algorithms for likelihood calculation and ancestral state reconstruction under Wright's threshold model, applying our methods to a data set of trait data for extrafloral nectaries across a phylogeny of 839 Fabales species."

As we widen our focus from the evolution of genes to the evolution of genomes, individuals, and populations, a whole new class of modeling challenges present themselves. These include the development of realistic quantitative models for traits which vary over a continuous range of values (O'Meara 2012). Of course, the usefulness of any new model is contingent on the tools available to compute with them. The main contribution of this article is to show how, by combining ideas from statistical phylogenetics and numerical mathematics, we can compute efficiently with a far larger range of evolutionary models."

Felsenstein's approach extends to other Gaussian processes, notably the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process (Lande 1976;Felsenstein 1988;Hansen 1997), and for several decades, Gaussian models were used almost exclusively to model the evolution of quantitative traits. Ho and An\u00e9 (2014) used clever algebraic techniques to develop an alternative algorithm for computing the likelihood and related quantities. They survey several other models which can be handled using the same approach.",

The drawback of these methods is that they are fundamentally restricted to models which are Gaussian processes or transforms of Gaussian processes, where the computational bottleneck lies in the computation of a quadratic form involving the covariance matrix of Ho and An\u00e9 (2014). Many evolutionary models cannot be handled within this framework (e.g., Ronquist 2004;Landis et al. 2013). Some of the properties of Gaussian processes are quite restrictive: Gaussian processes have single modes, so can only model adaptive landscapes with single peaks; Brownian motion has independent increments, so the rate of change is independent of the value of a trait. The standard strategy for computing with non-Gaussian models is to resort to Monte-Carlo strategies. Even when we are working with a model satisfying the assumptions of Ho and An\u00e9 (2014), the algorithms they describe do not give an efficient method for integrating over sets of trait values at the tips, as in the threshold models we discuss below.",

Both of these processes have analytical transition probabilities in some special cases. Lepage et al. (2006) use the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process to model rate variation across a phylogeny. Like the OU process (but unlike Brownian motion), the CIR process is ergodic. It has a stationary Gamma density which can be used for the root density.

(2012) introduce and apply a new discrete state model for morphological traits which, in addition to states for presence and absence, incorporates an intermediate \"precursor\" state. Whenever the intermediate state is observed at the tips it is coded as \"absent.\" The motivation behind the model is that the intermediate state represents evolutionary precursors, changes which are necessary for the evolution of a new state but which may not be directly observed. These precursors could explain repeated parallel evolution of a trait in closely related traits (Marazzi et al. 2012). They compiled a data set recording presence or absence of plant EFNs across a phylogeny of 839 species of Fabales, fitting their models to these data. The threshold model also involves evolutionary precursors in terms of changes in ancestral liabilities. We use these models, and our new algorithms to analyze the EFN data set. Our analysis also makes use of the time-calibrated phylogeny inferred by Simon et al. (2009), although unlike Marazzi et al. (2012) we ignore phylogenetic uncertainty.",

When a branch length is short, the transition density becomes highly peaked, as does the function being integrated. Such functions are difficult to approximate with piecewise quadratics, and Simpson's method can fail miserably. Indeed, for N < 50, we would often observe estimated probabilities equal to 0, or estimates greater than 1! (These were omitted from the plots). Although we can always bound estimates computed by the algorithm, a sounder approach is to improve the integration technique. This we did using the Gaussian kernel method, and the result was far improved accuracy for little additional computation. For the remainder of the experiments with this model we used the Gaussian kernel method when carrying out numerical integration.  Marazzi et al. (2012). All likelihoods and AIC values rounded to 1 d.p. Boldface indicates the best fitting model for each trait. A pre-cursor model with one parameter was used for all experiments, except for trait 6 where a two-parameter model gave a better AIC than the one-parameter model (see discussion in Marazzi et al. (2012).  Marazzi et al. (2012) describe AIC comparisons between their precursor model and a conventional binary trait model. We extend this comparison to include the threshold model. This is a one parameter model, the parameter being the value of the liability at the root. We used the MATLAB command fminsearch with multiple starting points to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for this value. The resulting log-likelihood was log?L \u00bc \u00c0240:6, giving an AIC of 483.2.

Felsenstein's pruning algorithm for continuous characters is limited to Gaussian processes and breaks down if, for example, the transition probabilities are governed by Levy processes (Landis et al. 2013). In contrast, our approach works whenever we can numerically evaluation transition densities, an indeed only a few minor changes would transform our Algorithm 1 to one implementing on a far more complex evolutionary process.",
