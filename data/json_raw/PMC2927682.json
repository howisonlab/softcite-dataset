Methods Pain and comorbidity data was collected at three time points in a prospective population-based cohort study. Pairwise tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and genotyped for seven genes. Genetic association analysis was carried out using zero-infl ated negative binomial regression to test for association between SNPs and the maximum number of pain sites across the three time points in participants reporting pain, reported as proportional changes with 95% CIs. SNPs were also tested for association with chronic widespread pain (CWP) using logistic regression reporting odds ratios and 95% CI. Results A total of 75 SNPs were successfully genotyped in 994 participants including 164 cases with persistent CWP and 172 pain-free controls. Multiple SNPs in SERPINA6 were associated with the maximum number of pain sites; for example, each copy of the T allele of rs941601 was associated with having 16% (proportional change=1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.28, p=0.006) more pain sites compared to participants with the CC genotype. SERPINA6 gene SNPs were also associated with CWP. Signifi cant associations between the maximum number of pain sites and SNPs in the CRHBP and POMC genes were also observed and a SNP in MC2R was also associated with CWP. Associations between SNPs and comorbidity of poor sleep quality and depression explained some of the associations observed. Conclusions Genetic variation in HPA axis genes was associated with musculoskeletal pain; however, some of the associations were explained by comorbidities. Replication of these fi ndings is required in independent cohorts.",

Consequently SNPs associating with pain were tested for association with these factors. The minor allele of the SERPINA6 SNP, rs8022616, was associated with a reduced likelihood of developing a depressive disorder and increased sleep quality. The minor C allele of the CRHBP SNP, rs1875999, was associated with increased likelihood of developing a depressive disorder and reduced sleep quality. This is in contrast to a previous report in which the common T allele of rs1875999 was signifi cantly associated with increased odds of having major depressive disorder in a Swedish population. 28 These factors appear to explain the associations between these two SNPs and pain as they became non-signifi cant after adjustment for them; however, a reduced odds of having CWP was still observed in participants with the minor allele of rs8022616. Genetic variation in SERPINA6 could infl uence pain and psychological factors independently as previous fi ndings from the EPIFUND study showed that HPA axis dysfunction increases the odds of developing CWP independently of depression and other psychological factors. 29 Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) shares some similarity in its aetiology and symptoms with CWP and evidence of hypofunction of the HPA axis in CFS has been reported. 30 Therefore, the same genes may be associated with CFS and pain susceptibility. Polymorphisms in NR3C1 have previously been associated with CFS 31 and shown to distinguish between different classes of CFS. 32 However, there was no evidence of association between SNPs in NR3C1 and musculoskeletal pain in this study. The most likely explanation for this is the modest sample size most notably in the previous studies but also in this study. Alternatively the previous genetic associations observed with CFS may be specifi c to CFS rather than being genetic predictors for functional somatic syndromes.",

However, this results in a limited sample size. A novel method was used to quantify pain by creating a composite score of the number of body regions, from 0 to 29, making it possible to examine the relationship between genetic variation and musculoskeletal pain in the entire study population thus increasing statistical power. One limitation of the study is that ethnicity of participants was not determined; however, participants were derived from predominantly white Caucasian geographic areas. Another limitation of our study is that due to limited power we have chosen not to correct for multiple testing. Indeed correcting for the number of effective tests, accounting for LD between SNPs, using the methodology proposed by Li and Ji 35 would result in a p value cut-off of 0.00037; none of the associations observed reached this level of signifi cance. However, this method of correction is comparatively stringent and may result in false negatives if applied. To be certain whether these are true pain susceptibility loci or false positives, independent replication of these fi ndings in larger cohorts is essential.",
