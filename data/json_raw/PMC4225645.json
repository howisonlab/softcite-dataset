The fatty acid compositions of various tissues, including blood, are associated with obesity and obesityassociated disorders. Thus, tracking plasma phospholipid (PL) features and metabolic parameters in young individuals may strengthen the utility of fatty acid composition as an early biomarker of future metabolic disorders. Methods: Anthropometric and blood biochemical data were obtained from 131 Korean males aged 10.5 AE 0.4 years, and followed up at 2 years. We analyzed the plasma PL fatty acids according to obesity. Obese children were defined as those with a body mass index (BMI) greater than the 85 th percentile for age and gender, based on Korean child growth standards. Results: Activities of lipid desaturases, stearyl-CoAD (SCD-16,16:1n-7/16:0), delta-6D (D6D, 20:3n-6/18:2n-6), and delta-5D (D5D, 20:4n-6/20:3n-6), were estimated. Obese individuals had significantly higher proportions of palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) and dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (DGLA, 20:3n-6) at both baseline and follow-up than did lean individuals. The activities of SCD-16 and D6D were higher in obese than lean boys. The baseline SCD-16 activity level was positively associated with the baseline waist circumference (WC) and the metabolic risk score. The baseline D6D level was positively associated with WC and also with the",

Childhood obesity increases the risk of developing health problems including insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic syndrome [1,2], and also adult obesity and cardiovascular disease [3,4]. Therefore, early detection of childhood obesity and metabolic disorders is required to efficiently prevent development of problems in adulthood. Studies on child populations may clarify the mechanisms underlying the development of obesity and metabolic disorders, because problems in children are not confounded by the consequences of advanced metabolic disorders.",

Higher levels of saturated fatty acids, palmitoleic acid, linoleic acid, and dihomogamma linolenic acid (DGLA), have been reported to be associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. In addition, both animal and human studies have suggested that fatty acid desaturases play roles in various metabolic disturbances, including dyslipidemia and IR [12]. The data have been derived principally from crosssectional studies, which cannot predict the future development of obesity and metabolic disorders. Longitudinal studies can yield integrated information on the development of metabolic disorders over time, and can identify the optimal points of intervention [13]. Therefore, in the present study, we explored the longitudinal relations of plasma phospholipid (PL) fatty acid composition and desaturase activities to IR and metabolic risk factors in Korean boys.",

The IR index was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [15].

Individual fatty acids were identified by comparing retention times to those of standards and quantified based on the peak area relative to the total methylated fatty acid peak area (set at 100%).

            "text": "We investigated the relationships between individual plasma PL fatty acids and desaturase activities and metabolic risk factors in Korean children. Furthermore, we explored the longitudinal relations of estimates of desaturase activity to body fatness, IR, and metabolic risk score. Obese boys had significantly higher proportions of palmitoleic acid and DGLA at baseline than did lean children, in agreement with data on Japanese children [9]. Increased DGLA levels are positively associated with the development of metabolic disorders in both adults and children [19e21]. A previous crosssectional study found that obese children have higher proportions of DGLA in plasma lipids than do those of normal weight [21]. Our data are in agreement with these earlier reports. The present study, a longitudinal study, also shows that obese boys had persistently high proportions of DGLA and palmitoleic acid at follow-up. Assessment of plasma DGLA level and/or palmitoleic acid level would give useful information on obesity status in children. Additionally, the present study shows that the baseline plasma DGLA content was positively associated with both present and future adiposity index values and metabolic risk score in Korean children. Plasma fatty acid composition could be regulated by many factors such as dietary, hormonal, and environmental factors [12,22]. To assess the effect of dietary fatty acids on the serum PL fatty acid composition of the study participant, a reliable database for fatty acid composition of Korean food is needed, but was not available at this time. Linoleic acid (18:2n-6) is directly converted into 18:3n-6 by D6D and rapidly elongated to 20:3n-6 (DGLA) [22]. DGLA is converted into arachidonic acid by D5D [22]. The DGLA level, regulated by D6D activity, is increased by insulin [12]. Hyperinsulinemia induced by obesity might change the expression level of D6D. We observed D6D had a positive association with HOMA-IR, a surrogate marker of IR for epidemiology study. The observed increases in DGLA concentration and D6D activity, accompanied by a fall in D5D expression, in obese individuals suggest that impaired fatty acid metabolism, possibly caused by the development of IR, may trigger the accumulation of DGLA. Although DGLA plays multiple roles in protecting against inflammation and cell proliferation [22], increases in DGLA and D6D levels in association with IR could nonetheless aggravate metabolic disorders. A recent cross-sectional study with Korean adults suggested D6D as a major factor for determining plasma level of C-reactive protein, a surrogate marker for inflammation [23].",

            "text": "Not only was the baseline D6D activity significantly higher in obese than in lean children at baseline, but it was also positively associated with adiposity indices at follow-up. Baseline D6D activity also exhibited positive associations with the follow-up values of surrogate markers of IR and metabolic disorders, including the TG level, HOMA-IR value, and metabolic risk score. Accumulating evidence suggests that D6D plays a crucial role in the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome. High levels of D6D activity have been estimated in adults with obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome [18,24,25]. Warensjo et al [25] found that a higher estimated D6D activity increased the risk of metabolic syndrome over 20 years in middle-aged men. To the best of our knowledge, only one prior study [26] explored the associations between longitudinal changes in fatty acid composition and body fatness in children. In that study, increased D6D activity was significantly associated with an elevated waist-to-hip ratio in both boys and girls. The authors suggested that D6D activity was positively associated with an increased HOMA-IR value only in girls [26]. However, their small sample size may have limited the observations that could be made. In the present study, the D6D levels did not vary greatly over the 2 years, whereas the HOMA-IR level increased. Thus, no positive association between changes in D6D and changes in the HOMA-IR value were noted. However, baseline D6D activity was positively associated with both baseline and follow-up HOMA-IR values, and also follow-up metabolic risk score. Results from the present multiple regression analysis suggested that WC and D6D were the major determinants of HOMA-IR and metabolic risk score, a suggested tool for an early-life determination of metabolic risk. Thus early detection of elevated D6D activity in Korean boys may predict the future development of IR and associated metabolic disorders including dyslipidemia. Adequate regulation of D6D level at an early age may help prevent the development of metabolic disorders.",
