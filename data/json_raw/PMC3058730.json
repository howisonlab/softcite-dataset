            "text": "Time for primary review: 43 days Aims Resveratrol (RV), an antioxidant, inhibits angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertrophy and Ang II-or epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced Akt phosphorylation in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Both signalling pathways are reported to utilize reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of this study was to show whether RV reduces the ROS level in Ang II-or EGF-activated VSMCs and whether reduction of ROS causes the impeded signalling towards Akt in the presence of RV. Methods and results We show here that RV reduces intracellular ROS and extracellular H 2 O 2 release from VSMCs as measured using 2 \u2032 ,7 \u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate and Amplex Red TM. Since NADPH oxidases (Nox) 1 and 4 are major ROS sources in VSMCs, we examined their need for Akt phosphorylation in response to Ang II or EGF. Experiments using the blocking peptide gp91ds-tat verified a role for Nox1 in Ang II signalling towards Akt, but excluded a role for Nox1 in the respective EGF signalling. A small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of Nox4 showed that Nox4 was not required for Ang II-or EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation. Use of the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, N-acetyl-cysteine, and non-antioxidant RV derivatives revealed that the antioxidant capacity of RV is not required for the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, in both rat and human VSMCs. Conclusion Thus, although RV acts as an antioxidant, the antihypertrophic response of RV in VSMCs and the signalling downstream of the EGF receptor towards Akt seem to be largely redox independent."

            "text": "The small polyphenol resveratrol (RV), found in various plant-derived sources, including grapes, is considered to contribute to the beneficial effect of red wine in cardiovascular diseases. 1 -3 Pharmacological activities of RV relevant for a putative cardio-and vasoprotective effect include the reduction of platelet aggregation, low-density lipoprotein oxidation, prostaglandin synthesis, and tumour necrosis factor-a-induced activation of endothelial cells, as well as the promotion of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression and activity. 2,3 In addition, RV has been shown to inhibit growth-related signalling pathways in cardiac fibroblasts and to protect against ischaemia-reperfusion injury. 2,3 Previous work of our group has demonstrated an antihypertrophic action of RV in angiotensin II (Ang II)-activated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which is mediated by a selective inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. 4,5 Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, but is also involved in inflammatory processes, vascular oxidative stress, cell growth, and extracellular matrix deposition, promoting endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodelling. 6,7 In the vessel wall, VSMCs are the principal target cells of Ang II in which it promotes contraction contraction, cell growth (hypertrophy), migration, and increased extracellular matrix deposition via activation of the Ang II type 1 AT 1 receptor. 7 In VSMCs, the cellular signalling pathways mediating hypertrophy are complex. Important steps are the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase, a major source of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGF-R) in a ROS-and c-Src-dependent manner. 6 -9 Downstream of the EGF-R, Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathways are activated. 9 We have previously shown that RV does not interfere with the transactivation of the EGF-R in Ang II-activated VSMCs when inhibiting Akt phosphorylation. In accordance with this, EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation was also inhibited by RV in VSMCs. 5 Thus, RV interferes with the signalling towards Akt downstream of the EGF-R in Ang II-or EGF-activated VSMCs. The exact mode of action of RV in VSMCs has remained elusive, although some data have suggested activation of the redox-sensitive proteintyrosine phosphatase (PTP) Shp2 (Src homology-2-containing proteintyrosine phosphatase-2) as a mechanism. 5 Many activities of RV that are thought to contribute to its cardioand vasoprotective effect, including the activation of redox-sensitive PTPs, such as Shp2, may be explained by its antioxidant activity. 2 ROS are involved in cell signaling, leading to cell growth and migration, activation of MMPs, altered function of many kinases and phosphatases, and activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors. 10 In addition, ROS oxidize low-density lipoprotein and may inactivate NO. 11 In VSMCs, the most important source of ROS are the NAD(P)H oxidases Nox1 and Nox4. 12 -14 Nox1 is highly expressed in proliferating VSMCs and is activated by a variety of growth factors, such as Ang II and platelet-derived growth factor, contributing to their activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt. 13,15,16 The function of Nox4, the only constitutively active NAD(P)H oxidase, is less clear. 15,16 In VSMCs, Nox4 was found within distinct subcellular locations, such as the nucleus or the endoplasmic reticulum, but also at focal adhesions where the transactivated EGF-R and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) can be found after Ang II stimulation. 15 -18 While Nox1 is known to be required for Ang II-induced EGF-R transactivation, little is known how the EGF-activated EGF-R induces ROS production 19,20 that may lead to PTP oxidation and signal transduction. 21 The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the following: (i) whether RV reduces the ROS level in or H 2 O 2 released from Ang IIor EGF-activated VSMCs; (ii) whether Nox1 or Nox4 proteins, or ROS in general, are required for the phosphorylation of Akt downstream of the EGF-R; and thus (iii) whether RV may act directly or indirectly as an 'antioxidant' when inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt.",

Quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were pre-incubated with dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate (H 2 DCF-DA; 20 mM, 15 min) and then incubated with 50 mM RV or vehicle control for 30 min or 10 mM diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) for 1 h and finally stimulated with 100 nM Ang II for 15 min (A) or 100 ng/mL EGF for 10 min (B). ROS production (equivalent to the amount of formed DCF) was analysed by flow cytometry. The average fluorescence signal obtained in the presence of Ang II or EGF was set to 100% (**P , 0.01; one-way ANOVA vs. Ang II or EGF treatment, n \u00bc 3). Serum-starved VSMCs were stimulated in Amplex Red TM buffer with Ang II (100 nM; C) or EGF (100 ng/mL; D) for 5 -15 min after pre-incubation with RV (50 mM) or vehicle control for 30 min. H 2 O 2 production was quantified by fluorescence measurement. Absolute values were correlated to catalase-treated cells used as a negative control. oxidases play a pivotal role in VSMC-derived ROS production, DPI, an unspecific inhibitor of flavin-containing enzymes including NAD(P)H oxidases, 25 was used as positive control. For detection of intracellular ROS, we loaded VSMCs with 20 mM H 2 DCF-DA. Angiotensin II (100 nM) was able to induce ROS production twofold compared with the vehicle control. Resveratrol (50 mM) and DPI (10 mM) pre-treatment reduced this ROS production almost to the basal level ( Figure 1A). In contrast, treatment of cells with 100 ng/mL EGF, a concentration that readily induced Akt phosphorylation, did not lead to a significant activation of intracellular ROS production in comparison with the vehicle control. Resveratrol and DPI, however, were able to inhibit basal intracellular ROS level by about 50% ( Figure 1B), verifying a strong ROS reducing activity for both compounds. Activation of the EGF-R has been reported to lead to increased extracellular H 2 O 2 levels in A431 cells. 19 Therefore, we also measured extracellular H 2 O 2 level using Amplex Red TM . Both Ang II and EGF were able to induce the extracellular release of H 2 O 2 in a time-dependent manner ( Figure 1C and D). Whereas EGF treatment led to a continuous accumulation of H 2 O 2 , which was highest after 15 min (20% above basal level), H 2 O 2 production after Ang II stimulation peaked at 10 min (15% above basal level). Resveratrol reduced Ang II-and EGF-induced H 2 O 2 but also basal levels far below control values ( Figure 1C and D). These findings demonstrate that RV blocks both H 2 O 2 detected in the extracellular environment and intracellular total ROS produced in VSMCs.",

After 72 h, Nox4 mRNA level was analysed by qPCR. The siRNA reduced the Nox4 mRNA level to 15% compared with scrambled control, whereas the mRNA level of Nox1 was unchanged (Figure 2A and B). As expected, knock-down of Nox4 had no impact on the phosphorylation of Akt after Ang II (100 nM, 10 min) stimulation. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of RV on Akt phosphorylation remained unaffected ( Figure 2C). Interestingly, the EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation and the inhibitory effect of RV also remained unaltered in Nox4 knock-down cells ( Figure 2D). Thus, Nox4 seems not to be involved in Ang II-or EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt, and therefore Nox4-derived ROS are not a potential target of RV.

As expected, gp91ds-tat pretreatment led to an inhibition of Ang II-mediated Akt phosphorylation ( Figure 3A). In contrast to RV, gp91ds-tat also inhibited the phosphorylation of p38, a known redox-sensitive kinase, by more than 50% ( Figure 3B). In EGF-activated VSMCs, gp91ds-tat, in contrast to RV, had no effect on Akt phosphorylation ( Figure 3C). A putative effect of gp91ds-tat on p38 phosphorylation did not reach significance ( Figure 3D). The unspecific control peptide used had no influence on Akt or p38 phosphorylation in response to either stimulus (data not shown). These data show that Nox1 is important for Ang II-but not for EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and p38.

            "text": "( Figure 5B). Mono-methylation at the 4 \u2032 -OH group renders RV largely redox inactive, since Queiroz et al. have recently shown that the prime antioxidant pharmacophore of RV is 4 \u2032 -hydroxystilbene, 27 a finding that is also supported by others 26 and confirmed by our synthesized derivatives in vitro (see Supplementary material online, Figure  S1). To test their redox activity in the presence of cells we used Amplex Red TM to detect extracellular H 2 O 2 in the presence of RV or its derivatives, RV-3M and RV-1M. As expected, neither of the two derivatives was found to reduce extracellularly detected H 2 O 2 significantly after stimulation of VSMCs with Ang II ( Figure 6A). Using Akt phosphorylation as read-out, RV-3M inhibited neither Ang II-nor EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation. Most interestingly, however, the derivative RV-1M, despite its lack of influence on H 2 O 2 , reduced phosphorylation of Akt in response to Ang II treatment by over 50%, which was comparable to RV-mediated inhibition. The EGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited equally well by RV-1M compared with RV ( Figure 6B and C). These data clearly show that RV inhibits Akt phosphorylation by a mechanism that is not related to its antioxidant activity in both Ang II-and EGFstimulated VSMCs. In contrast, the 3-and 5-OH groups of RV seem to be critically involved in mediating Akt inhibition. A consistent picture of redox-independent inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by RV and RV-1M was observed in human primary aortic smooth muscle cells (see Supplementary material online, Figure S2).",

This H 2 O 2 seems not to play a major role for the signal transduction towards Akt and p38.

            "text": "Many pharmacological effects of RV are believed to be related to its antioxidant activity. In the field of cardiovascular diseases, Opie & Lecour recently summarized several of the RV effects that could be linked to an antioxidant action, including inhibition of low-density lipoprotein oxidation, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, downregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and nuclear factor-kB, reduction of platelet activation and inhibition of Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and they speculated that even more RV effects might be redox related, although not proven yet. 2 Especially the report showing that RV inhibits Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by its antioxidant activity may be of interest in our context. The authors show that RV (1-100 mM) inhibits Ang II-induced [ 3 H]leucine incorporation as a measure for hypertrophy, beta-myosin heavy chain promoter activity, intracellular ROS level and ERK phosphorylation (although not examining other kinases) in cardiomyocytes. To link the antioxidant activity to the antihypertrophic effect of RV, they show that RV and the antioxidant NAC inhibit Ang II-or H 2 O 2 -induced [ 3 H]leucine incorporation in cardiomyocytes comparably. 28 In some Figure 6 Non-antioxidant trans-3,5-dihydroxy-4 \u2032 -methoxystilbene (RV-1M) inhibits phosphorylation of Akt after Ang II and EGF stimulation. (A) Starved VSMCs were stimulated in Amplex Red TM buffer with Ang II (100 nM) for 10 min after pre-incubation with RV or RV derivatives (RV, RV-3M, RV-1M; all 50 mM), or vehicle control for 30 min. H 2 O 2 production was quantified by fluorescence measurement. The graph shows the relative extracellular H 2 O 2 production (**P , 0.01; one-way ANOVA vs. Ang II or EGF treatment, n \u00bc 3). (B and C). Serum-deprived cells were pre-treated with RV or RV derivatives, RV-3M or RV-1M, for 30 min (50 mM), followed by stimulation with 100 nM Ang II for 10 min (B), or 100 ng/mL EGF for 5 min (C ). Protein levels were detected by western blot using antibodies against pAkt and tubulin. One representative blot out of three per stimulation is shown. Graphs show the mean + SEM of the densitometric signals; Ang II or EGF stimulation is set to 100% (**P , 0.01; one-way ANOVA vs. Ang II or EGF treatment, n \u00bc 3). parts, the above report is in agreement with this and previous studies of our group, although we used VSMCs instead of cardiomyocytes; we found an inhibition of Ang II-induced hypertrophy measured by [ 3 H]leucine incorporation 4 and now also ROS production by RV. Next to a minor effect on ERK phosphorylation, we found a strong inhibition of the PI3K -Akt pathway leading more downstream to an effective inhibition of p70 S6 kinase important for cellular hypertrophy. 4 Here we show, however, that inhibition of ROS and Akt phosphorylation are two parallel events mediated by RV that could not be causally linked in our system.",

            "text": "Our data also imply that the transduction of the signal induced by EGF in VSMCs is less redox dependent than that of Ang II, at least towards Akt and p38. Indeed, data regarding the ROS production of the EGF-activated (not transactivated) EGF-R and their importance for subsequent signal transduction are limited. The first report showing an intracellular increase in H 2 O 2 production in response to EGF used epithelial A431 cells and concentrations of EGF as high as 500 ng/mL for stimulation. 29 Halvey et al., 20 also detecting an increase of intracellular ROS after EGF stimulation in HaCaT cells, still used 200 ng/mL EGF. In agreement with our data, DeYulia et al. 19 showed in 293T cells transiently transfected with EGF-R that the addition of EGF (50 ng/mL) results in elevated extracellular H 2 O 2 . They even found that solely the receptor -ligand interaction using isolated proteins was sufficient to produce H 2 O 2 . The exact mechanism by which ROS is produced, however, remained elusive. Regarding the ROS source that might be used by the EGF-R to transduce the EGF signal, Chen et al. proposed Nox4 that is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum and is critical for the regulation of PTP1B. Using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), and for transfection studies COS-7 cells, they suggest that Nox4-mediated oxidation and inactivation of PTP1B in the endoplasmic reticulum serves as a regulatory switch for EGF-R trafficking that terminates the EGF signal. 30 Moreover, both the activated EGF-R as well as Nox4 were shown to be localized at focal adhesions in VSMCs. 31 Knocking down Nox4 in our system, however, had no influence on EGF-as well as Ang II-induced Akt phosphorylation, which excludes Nox4 as essential mediator of signal transduction towards Akt downstream of the AT 1 -and EGF-R as well as a potential target of RV.",

The best-studied mechanism by which Nox1 is activated is that via the AT 1 receptor by Ang II, including activation of phospholipase C and subsequently protein kinase C that phosphorylates p47phox, a regulatory subunit of Nox1. Transactivation of the EGF-R leads to a PI3K-dependent activation of Rac1 that is required for continued activation of Nox1 by Ang II. 16 Our data presented here again verify this model; the blocking peptide gp91ds-tat effectively inhibited the Ang II-induced signalling towards Akt and p38. In contrast, EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and p38 was not significantly altered. We, therefore, excluded a Nox1-dependent mechanism activating Akt or p38 downstream of the EGF-R in our cells.",
