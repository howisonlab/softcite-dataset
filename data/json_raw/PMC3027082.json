            "text": "Aim: To determine if acetazolamide, an effective treatment for certain inherited channelopathies, has therapeutic effects on infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) in a well-studied subject, compare them to other therapies in the same subject and to tenotomy and reattachment (T&R) in other subjects. Methods: Eye-movement data were taken using a high-speed digital video recording system. Nystagmus waveforms were analyzed by applying an eXpanded Nystagmus Acuity Function (NAFX) at different gaze angles and determining the Longest Foveation Domain (LFD). Results: Acetazolamide improved foveation by both a 59.7% increase in the peak value of the NAFX function (from 0.395 to 0.580) and a 70% broadening of the NAFX vs Gaze Angle curve (the LFD increased from 20\u00b0 to 34\u00b0). The resulting U-shaped improvement in the percent NAFX vs Gaze Angle curve, varied from ~60% near the NAFX peak to over 1000% laterally. The therapeutic improvements in NAFX from acetazolamide (similar to T&R) were intermediate between those of soft contact lenses and convergence, the latter was best; for LFD improvements, acetazolamide and contact lenses were equivalent and less effective than convergence. Computer simulations suggested that damping the central oscillation driving INS was insufficient to produce the foveation improvements and increased NAFX values. Conclusion: Acetazolamide resulted in improved-foveation INS waveforms over a broadened range of gaze angles, probably acting at more than one site. This raises the question of whether hereditary INS involves an inherited channelopathy, and whether other agents with known effects on ion channels should be investigated as therapy for this condition.",

            "text": "Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) [1] is an ocular motor oscillation with well-defined waveforms and characteristics [2]. The pathogenesis of INS is unknown, but in some it is an inherited disorder in which several modes of inheritance have been identified [3]. The oscillations may be present at birth but often develop during early childhood and persist to some degree, despite the best current therapy. Although adaptive strategies often develop, such as foveation periods [4], the basic oscillations persist. Therapeutically, several approaches have been successfully employed to improve INS waveforms and expand the range of gaze angles with higher acuity [5,6]. They include surgical [7][8][9], optical [10], and pharmaceutical [11][12][13] therapies.",

This has been hypothesized to be the direct, functional cause of INS in all patients, whether or not they have associated, and precipitating afferent visual or genetic deficits. The hypothesized loss of smooth-pursuit damping was supported when embodied in a behavioral ocular motor system model that exhibited many emergent properties (not designed into it) [15]. It was further strengthened when the model subsequently predicted both the different INS responses to the same stimulus (based on its timing with regard to the INS cycle) [16,17] and the therapeutic results of the tenotomy and reattachment (T&R) procedure [8,15,[18][19][20]. However, even if this functional hypothesis proves to be accurate, the pursuit-system instability itself could be the result of one or more abnormalities at the cellular or neuronal level in subsets of INS patients.",

His nystagmus waveforms were well documented previously and their characteristics representative of others with INS. Because subjects have no voluntary control of their INS waveform characteristics, the data are not affected by subsequent testing. The subject had a convergence \"null\" and wore either 7 PD base-out prisms added to his refraction (OD: +3.00 S -2.50 C ax 150 and OS: +3.50 S -2.75 C ax 20) or contact lenses with no added prism. His best-corrected distance visual acuities were 20/25 with prisms and 20/40+ with contact lenses. For fixation targets, we use small LED's and reflected laser spots, which are not acuity limiting and yield the same ocular motor data with or without refraction. The subject was seated in a chair with a headrest and a chin stabilizer, far enough (>5 feet) from the stimulus screen to prevent convergence effects. At this distance the target subtended less than 0.1 of visual angle. The room light was turned off during the recording. The contact-lens experiment consisted of five trials performed by the subject while wearing contact lenses; we allowed time between trials for the subject to rest. Each trial tested fixation of horizontal targets from 30\u00b0 left gaze to 30\u00b0 right gaze, in 5\u00b0 steps. We used our standard patient paradigm to test the effects of acetazolamide on this subject. It consists of two trials, one in each direction (as described above), with the target remaining at each gaze angle for 5 sec during both the stepping out laterally and returning to primary position. Subtracting the required target acquisition times, this allows approximately 2-3 sec of steady fixation during each interval. NAFX values are calculated during steady fixations and averaged. This results in a small number of NAFX values at each gaze angle that we have found to be historically very close to each other in value, usually differing in the third decimal place in several studies of many patients. Our paradigm for taking and analyzing such data is based on real-life acquisition and identification of new targets in one's visual field.",

In an attempt to mimic the subject's INS characteristics, we used the OMS-model's built-in capabilities to set the NAFX peak to -2\u00b0 with a symmetrical, medium Alexander's law variation of the INS amplitude with gaze angle. Fig. (5) shows the main components of the OMS model (Smooth Pursuit, Fixation, Saccadic Pulse Generator, Internal Monitor, Fast and Slow Neural Integrators, and Fast and Slow Plant pathways) and of the PMC+ Block (part of the Smooth Pursuit system responsible for its damping). There, we simulated the hypothesized central effect of acetazolamide by reducing the gain factor, \"Central Therapy\" from 1.3 (the value required to match this subject's pre-acetazolamide INS) to 0.6. As Fig. (6a) shows, the simulated INS amplitude increased at gaze angles lateral to -2\u00b0 (as did the subject's) and the simulated effects of acetazolamide resulted in damped INS waveforms at all gaze angles. Calculating the NAFX values from the simulation data at those gaze angles resulted in a match to the subject's far-fixation data and an improved but not broadened NAFX vs Gaze Angle curve (i.e., the LFD values remained the same) for the simulated effects of acetazolamide (Fig. 6b).",

Comparative plots of a) percent increases in peak NAFX vs Pre-therapy NAFX and b) percent increases in LFD vs pre-therapy LFD during fixation of far targets with contact lenses, with acetazolamide, and during convergence at 60 PD. Curves shown are the estimated percent increases in peak NAFX and LFD for the tenotomy and reattachment (T&R) procedure. The aim of our study is to evaluate if this subject with INS, who took 1000mg/day of acetazolamide for three days to prevent altitude sickness, showed changes in his nystagmus waveforms. However, this subject's INS waveforms at each gaze angle were unchanged by acetazolamide, as they have been since his first eye-movement recording in the mid 1960's (compare also the original \"null\" position shown in Figs. (1, 2) with the more recent NAFX peaks and % NAFXimprovement troughs). Such intra-subject consistency is common, despite inter-subject variability, and has been documented in many patients who have had repeat studies in our laboratory years, or even decades, apart. Although acetazolamide did improve the average NAFX values over contact lenses, there was more variability at each gaze angle (possibly related to the subject's mild discomfort); this and the other the side effects might be contraindications to using acetazolamide (at the dosage used) as a therapy for INS.

Thus, the ocular motor system instability is indistinguishable between patient subpopulations and has the same direct, functional cause (e.g., loss of pursuit-system damping). As is evident from the literature, the terminology used and the questions posed when discussing the \"cause\" of a disorder often reflect one's training or approach to the problem. The geneticist speaks of a genetic abnormality, the physiologist or anatomist, of the misbehavior of a group of cells, their absence, or misrouting of their connections, and the control-systems analysist, of an unstable feedback loop. However, such diverse putative \"causes\" of a condition may be neither contradictory nor repetitious. Rather, each is a meaningful description to those with the corresponding background, while the other descriptions may seem somehow lacking. Going from initial speculation to a realistic hypothesis for INS requires establishing a functional connection between the putative \"cause\" and the resulting eye oscillation and ocular motor behavior. For example, in some with INS, a genetic abnormality or spontaneous occurrence could result in a channelopathy of the subset of cells that set the smooth-pursuit damping gain. Other INS patients might have calibration of that gain altered by lack of adequate visual input, still others by another physiological or anatomical disorder of the cells controlling pursuit damping. In all of these putative scenarios, the INS instability will be indistinguishable among patients, the direct, functional cause will be the same, but the precipitating factors and lower level mechanisms will differ.",

This use of accurate eye-movement data to diagnose INS and determine the therapeutic approach with the maximal therapeutic efficacy has also resulted in an analysis procedure whereby we can estimate a priori the percent improvement and final values for both the NAFX and LFD; the former also allows estimation of the improvement in measured (not just potential) visual acuity of Fig. (5).

Our research has shown that it is the act of convergence that damps INS in those patients who demonstrate this effect. That act of convergence is the same whether or not it is induced by prisms or by a surgically induced divergence. The static concept of \"weakening\" a muscle is of little use in understanding the dynamic effects of most eye-muscle surgery or vergence on an oscillation like INS. Although the antagonist muscles of each eye receive different innervations for convergence, the resultant force is equal in each muscle. Rather, it is alteration of the proprioceptively controlled resting muscle tension that is responsible. In fact, we test for the efficacy of the bimedial rectus recession procedure in binocular patients with an INS convergence null by having them wear BO prisms. Also, due to the fact that the muscles wrap around the equator and attach closer to the cornea, small recessions do not substantially weaken the mechanical advantage of the muscle. The different innervations of the EOM during convergence result in equal and opposite forces in the two antagonist muscles of each eye and are not what reduces their small-signal gain. Prism-induced vergence produces the same broadening effects as the T&R procedure, implying the same mechanism of action and removing the requirement for the addition of bilateral rectus muscle T&R to the bimedial rectus recession procedure. Based on our analyses of hundreds of INS patients, where convergence nulls have always been greater than gaze-angle nulls, we concluded long ago that inducing convergence in binocular patients with convergence damping would have greater therapeutic improvement than any other known therapyeither base-out prisms or the bimedial rectus recession procedure should be the therapy of choice in these patients. Because the eye-movement data from this subject are representative of the INS population in general, if surgery were to be considered for the subject of this study, maximal therapeutic improvement would result from a bimedial rectus recession procedure. There is no evidence that inducing convergence by either method will cause strabismus in these binocular patients; both therapies have resulted in large, sustained improvements in visual function. Further neurophysiological study of convergence's effects on proprioception is needed to clarify the specific mechanism involved.",

Therapies may either be directed: 1) afferently to alleviate the visual condition that interfered with damping calibration [33][34][35]; 2) centrally at the cells responsible for damping miscalibration (as some drugs may do, although they may also act elsewhere with possibly undesirable side effects) [11][12][13]; or 3) peripherally to reduce the effects of the underlying instability (e.g., vergence prisms, contact lenses, or the T&R procedure) [7,8,36]. It is unclear whether acetazolamide affected a channelopathy in a subset of central or peripheral neurons (i.e., whether it affected the \"cause\" or merely ameliorated the \"effect\"-as does the T&R procedure).

That is, we hypothesized that acetazolamide has the single ocular motor effect of centrally damping the causal INS oscillation. Analysis of the simulated results produced an NAFX vs Gaze Angle curve that was higher (i.e., allowing better visual acuity) but not wider (i.e., allowing high acuity over more gaze angles). This did not accurately simulate the subject's data, which showed both improvements. Thus, this single-site hypothesis for the effects of acetazolamide on this subject was disproven; i.e., the model suggested that acetazolamide's action was not limited to only that ocular motor site.
