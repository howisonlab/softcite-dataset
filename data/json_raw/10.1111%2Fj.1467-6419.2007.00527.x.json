It is widely applied when evaluating labour market policies, but empirical examples can be found in very diverse fields of study. Once the researcher has decided to use PSM, he is confronted with a lot of questions regarding its implementation. To begin with, a first decision has to be made concerning the estimation of the propensity score. Following that one has to decide which matching algorithm to choose and determine the region of common support. Subsequently, the matching quality has to be assessed and treatment effects and their standard errors have to be estimated. Furthermore, questions like 'what to do if there is choice-based sampling?' or 'when to measure effects?' can be important in empirical studies. Finally, one might also want to test the sensitivity of estimated treatment effects with respect to unobserved heterogeneity or failure of the common support condition. Each implementation step involves a lot of decisions and different approaches can be thought of. The aim of this paper is to discuss these implementation issues and give some guidance to researchers who want to use PSM for evaluation purposes.",

            "text": "Matching has become a popular approach to estimate causal treatment effects. It is widely applied when evaluating labour market policies (see e.g., Heckman et al., 1997a;Dehejia and Wahba, 1999), but empirical examples can be found in very diverse fields of study. It applies for all situations where one has a treatment, a group of treated individuals and a group of untreated individuals. The nature of treatment may be very diverse. For example, Perkins et al. (2000) discuss the usage of matching in pharmacoepidemiologic research. Hitt and Frei (2002) analyse the effect of online banking on the profitability of customers. Davies and Kim (2003) compare the effect on the percentage bid-ask spread of Canadian firms being interlisted on a US Exchange, whereas Brand and Halaby (2006) analyse the effect of elite college attendance on career outcomes. Ham et al. (2004) study the effect of a migration decision on the wage growth of young men and Bryson (2002) analyses the effect of union membership on wages of employees. Every microeconometric evaluation study has to overcome the fundamental evaluation problem and address the possible occurrence of selection bias. The first problem arises because we would like to know the difference between the participants' outcome with and without treatment. Clearly, we cannot observe both outcomes for the same individual at the same time. Taking the mean outcome of nonparticipants as an approximation is not advisable, since participants and nonparticipants usually differ even in the absence of treatment. This problem is known as selection bias and a good example is the case where high-skilled individuals have a higher probability of entering a training programme and also have a higher probability of finding a job. The matching approach is one possible solution to the selection problem. It originated from the statistical literature and shows a close link to the experimental context. 1 Its basic idea is to find in a large group of nonparticipants those individuals who are similar to the participants in all relevant pretreatment characteristics X. That being done, differences in outcomes of this well selected and thus adequate control group and of participants can be attributed to the programme. The underlying identifying assumption is known as unconfoundedness, selection on observables or conditional independence. It should be clear that matching is no 'magic bullet' that will solve the evaluation problem in any case. It should only be applied if the underlying identifying assumption can be credibly invoked based on the informational richness of the data and a detailed understanding of the institutional set-up by which selection into treatment takes place (see for example the discussion in Blundell et al., 2005). For the rest of the paper we will assume that this assumption holds.",

            "text": "Since conditioning on all relevant covariates is limited in the case of a high dimensional vector X ('curse of dimensionality'), Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983b) suggest the use of so-called balancing scores b(X), i.e. functions of the relevant observed covariates X such that the conditional distribution of X given b(X) is independent of assignment into treatment. One possible balancing score is the propensity score, i.e. the probability of participating in a programme given observed characteristics X. Matching procedures based on this balancing score are known as propensity score matching (PSM) and will be the focus of this paper. Once the researcher has decided to use PSM, he is confronted with a lot of questions regarding its implementation. Figure 1 summarizes the necessary steps when implementing PSM. 2 The aim of this paper is to discuss these issues and give some practical guidance to researchers who want to use PSM for evaluation purposes. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will describe the basic evaluation framework and possible treatment effects of interest. Furthermore we show how PSM solves the evaluation problem and highlight the implicit identifying assumptions. In Section 3, we will focus on implementation steps of PSM estimators. To begin with, a first decision has to be made concerning the estimation of the propensity score (see Section 3.1). One has not only to decide about the probability model to be used for estimation, but also about variables which should be included in this model. In Section 3.2, we briefly evaluate the (dis-)advantages of different matching algorithms. Following that we discuss how to check the overlap between treatment and comparison group and how to implement the common support requirement in Section 3.3. In Section 3.4 we will show how to assess the matching quality. Subsequently we present the problem of choice-based sampling and discuss the question 'when to measure programme effects?' in Sections 3.5 and 3.6. Estimating standard errors for treatment effects will be discussed in Section 3.7 before we show in 3.8 how PSM can be combined with other evaluation methods. The following Section 3.9 is concerned with sensitivity issues, where we first describe approaches that allow researchers to determine the sensitivity of estimated effects with respect to a failure of the underlying unconfoundedness assumption. After that we introduce an approach that incorporates information from those individuals who failed the common support restriction, to calculate bounds of the parameter of interest, if all individuals from the sample at hand would have been included. Section 3.10 will briefly discuss the issues of programme heterogeneity, dynamic selection problems, and the choice of an appropriate control group and includes also a brief review of the available software to implement matching. Finally, Section 4 reviews all steps and concludes.",

The main pillars of this model are individuals, treatment and potential outcomes.

The reason is that the weaker assumption of mean independence is intrinsically tied to functional form assumptions, making an identification of average effects on transformations of the original outcome impossible (Imbens, 2004). Furthermore, it will be difficult to argue why conditional mean independence should hold and Assumption 1 might still be violated in empirical studies.",

They show that if potential outcomes are independent of treatment conditional on covariates X, they are also independent of treatment conditional on a balancing score b(X). The propensity score P(D = 1 | X ) = P(X ), i.e. the probability for an individual to participate in a treatment given his observed covariates X, is one possible balancing score.

However, when the purpose of a model is classification rather than estimation of structural coefficients, it is less clear that these criticisms apply (Smith, 1997).

The multiple treatment case (as discussed in Imbens (2000) and Lechner (2001a)) consists of more than two alternatives, for example when an individual is faced with the choice to participate in job-creation schemes, vocational training or wage subsidy programmes or to not participate at all (we will describe this approach in more detail in Section 3.10). For that case it is well known that the multinomial logit is based on stronger assumptions than the multinomial probit model, making the latter the preferable option. 8 However, since the multinomial probit is computationally more burdensome, a practical alternative is to estimate a series of binomial models as suggested by Lechner (2001a). Bryson et al. (2002) note that there are two shortcomings regarding this approach. First, as the number of options increases, the number of models to be estimated increases disproportionately (for L options we need 0.5(L(L \u2212 1)) models). Second, in each model only two options at a time are considered and consequently the choice is conditional on being in one of the two selected groups. On the other hand, Lechner (2001a) compares the performance of the multinomial probit approach and series estimation and finds little difference in their relative performance. He suggests that the latter approach may be more robust since a mis-specification in one of the series will not compromise all others as would be the case in the multinomial probit model.",

The matching strategy builds on the CIA, requiring that the outcome variable(s) must be independent of treatment conditional on the propensity score. Hence, implementing matching requires choosing a set of variables X that credibly satisfy this condition. Heckman et al. (1997a) and Dehejia and Wahba (1999) show that omitting important variables can seriously increase bias in resulting estimates. Only variables that influence simultaneously the participation decision and the outcome variable should be included. Hence, economic theory, a sound knowledge of previous research and also information about the institutional settings should guide the researcher in building up the model (see e.g., Sianesi, 2004;Smith and Todd, 2005). It should also be clear that only variables that are unaffected by participation (or the anticipation of it) should be included in the model. To ensure this, variables should either be fixed over time or measured before participation. In the latter case, it must be guaranteed that the variable has not been influenced by the anticipation of participation.  also point out that the data for participants and nonparticipants should stem from the same sources (e.g. the same questionnaire). The better and more informative the data are, the easier it is to credibly justify the CIA and the matching procedure. However, it should also be clear that 'too good' data is not helpful either. If P(X ) = 0 or P(X ) = 1 for some values of X, then we cannot use matching conditional on those X values to estimate a treatment effect, because persons with such characteristics either always or never receive treatment. Hence, the common support condition as stated in Assumption 2 fails and matches cannot be performed. Some randomness is needed that guarantees that persons with identical characteristics can be observed in both states (Heckman et al., 1998b).",

As a note of caution, they stress that this amounts to choosing the propensity score model based on goodness-of-fit considerations, rather than based on theory and evidence about the set of variables related to the participation decision and the outcomes (Black and Smith, 2004). They also point out an interesting trade-off in finite samples between the plausibility of the CIA and the variance of the estimates. When using the full specification, bias arises from selecting a wide bandwidth in response to the weakness of the common support. In contrast to that, when matching on the minimal specification, common support is not a problem but the plausibility of the CIA is. This trade-off also affects the estimated standard errors, which are smaller for the minimal specification where the common support condition poses no problem.",

It may sometimes be felt that some variables play a specifically important role in determining participation and outcome (Bryson et al., 2002). As an example, one can think of the influence of gender and region in determining the wage of individuals. Let us take as given for the moment that men earn more than women and the wage level is higher in region A compared to region B. If we add dummy variables for gender and region in the propensity score estimation, it is still possible that women in region B are matched with men in region A, since the gender and region dummies are only a subset of all available variables. There are basically two ways to put greater emphasis on specific variables. One can either find variables in the comparison group who are identical with respect to these variables, or carry out matching on subpopulations. The study from Lechner (2002) is a good example for the first approach. He evaluates the effects of active labour market policies in Switzerland and uses the propensity score as a 'partial' balancing score which is complemented by an exact matching on sex, duration of unemployment and native language. Heckman et al. (1997aHeckman et al. ( , 1998a use the second strategy and implement matching separately for four demographic groups. That implies that the complete matching procedure (estimating the propensity score, checking the common support, etc.) has to be implemented separately for each group. This is analogous to insisting on a perfect match, e.g. in terms of gender and region, and then carrying out propensity score matching. This procedure is especially recommendable if one expects the effects to be heterogeneous between certain groups.",

In the former case, an untreated individual can be used more than once as a match, whereas in the latter case it is considered only once. Matching with replacement involves a trade-off between bias and variance. If we allow replacement, the average quality of matching will increase and the bias will decrease. This is of particular interest with data where the propensity score distribution is very different in the treatment and the control group. For example, if we have a lot of treated individuals with high propensity scores but only few comparison individuals with high propensity scores, we get bad matches as some of the high-score participants will get matched to low-score nonparticipants. This can be overcome by allowing replacement, which in turn reduces the number of distinct nonparticipants used to construct the counterfactual outcome and thereby increases the variance of the estimator (Smith and Todd, 2005). A problem which is related to NN matching without replacement is that estimates depend on the order in which observations get matched. Hence, when using this approach it should be ensured that ordering is randomly done. 11 It is also suggested to use more than one NN ('oversampling'). This form of matching involves a trade-off between variance and bias, too. It trades reduced variance, resulting from using more information to construct the counterfactual for each participant, with increased bias that results from on average poorer matches (see e.g. Smith, 1997). When using oversampling, one has to decide how many matching partners should be chosen for each treated individual and which weight (e.g. uniform or triangular weight) should be assigned to them.",

This can be avoided by imposing a tolerance level on the maximum propensity score distance (caliper). Hence, caliper matching is one form of imposing a common support condition (we will come back to this point in Section 3.3). Bad matches are avoided and the matching quality rises. However, if fewer matches can be performed, the variance of the estimates increases. 12 Applying caliper matching means that an individual from the comparison group is chosen as a matching partner for a treated individual that lies within the caliper ('propensity range') and is closest in terms of propensity score. As Smith and Todd (2005) note, a possible drawback of caliper matching is that it is difficult to know a priori what choice for the tolerance level is reasonable. Dehejia and Wahba (2002) suggest a variant of caliper matching which is called radius matching. The basic idea of this variant is to use not only the NN within each caliper but all of the comparison members within the caliper. A benefit of this approach is that it uses only as many comparison units as are available within the caliper and therefore allows for usage of extra (fewer) units when good matches are (not) available. Hence, it shares the attractive feature of oversampling mentioned above, but avoids the risk of bad matches.",

This method is also known as interval matching, blocking and subclassification (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1984). Clearly, one question to be answered is how many strata should be used in empirical analysis. Cochran (1968) shows that five subclasses are often enough to remove 95% of the bias associated with one single covariate. Since, as Imbens (2004) notes, all bias under unconfoundedness is associated with the propensity score, this suggests that under normality the use of five strata removes most of the bias associated with all covariates. One way to justify the choice of the number of strata is to check the balance of the propensity score (or the covariates) within each stratum (see e.g. Aakvik, 2001). Most of the algorithms can be described in the following way. First, check if within a stratum the propensity score is balanced. If not, strata are too large and need to be split. If, conditional on the propensity score being balanced, the covariates are unbalanced, the specification of the propensity score is not adequate and has to be respecified, e.g. through the addition of higher-order terms or interactions (see Dehejia and Wahba, 1999;Dehejia, 2005).",

            "text": "The matching algorithms discussed so far have in common that only a few observations from the comparison group are used to construct the counterfactual outcome of a treated individual. Kernel matching (KM) and local linear matching (LLM) are nonparametric matching estimators that use weighted averages of (nearly) all -depending on the choice of the kernel function -individuals in the control group to construct the counterfactual outcome. Thus, one major advantage of these approaches is the lower variance which is achieved because more information is used. A drawback of these methods is that possibly observations are used that are bad matches. Hence, the proper imposition of the common support condition is of major importance for KM and LLM. Heckman et al. (1998b) derive the asymptotic distribution of these estimators and Heckman et al. (1997a) present an application. As Smith and Todd (2005) note, KM can be seen as a weighted regression of the counterfactual outcome on an intercept with weights given by the kernel weights. Weights depend on the distance between each individual from the control group and the participant observation for which the counterfactual is estimated. It is worth noting that if weights from a symmetric, nonnegative, unimodal kernel are used, then the average places higher weight on persons close in terms of the propensity score of a treated individual and lower weight on more distant observations. The estimated intercept provides an estimate of the counterfactual mean. The difference between KM and LLM is that the latter includes in addition to the intercept a linear term in the propensity score of a treated individual. This is an advantage whenever comparison group observations are distributed asymmetrically around the treated observation, e.g. at boundary points, or when there are gaps in the propensity score distribution. When applying KM one has to choose the kernel function and the bandwidth parameter. The first point appears to be relatively unimportant in practice (DiNardo and Tobias, 2001). What is seen as more important (see e.g. Silverman, 1986;Pagan and Ullah, 1999) is the choice of the bandwidth parameter with the following Table 1. Trade-offs in Terms of Bias and Efficiency.",

It should be noted that LLM is a special case of local polynomial matching (LPM). LPM includes in addition to an intercept a term of polynomial order p in the propensity score, e.g. p = 1 for LLM, p = 2 for local quadratic matching or p = 3 for local cubic matching. Generally, the larger the polynomial order p is the smaller will be the asymptotic bias but the larger will be the asymptotic variance. To our knowledge Ham et al.

Clearly, asymptotically all PSM estimators should yield the same results, because with growing sample size they all become closer to comparing only exact matches (Smith, 2000). However, in small samples the choice of the matching algorithm can be important (Heckman et al., 1997a), where usually a trade-off between bias and variance arises (see Table 1). So what advice can be given to researchers facing the problem of choosing a matching estimator? It should be clear that there is no 'winner' for all situations and that the choice of the estimator crucially depends on the situation at hand. The performance of different matching estimators varies case-by-case and depends largely on the data structure at hand (Zhao, 2000). To give an example, if there are only a few control observations, it makes no sense to match without replacement. On the other hand, if there are a lot of comparable untreated individuals it might be worth using more than one NN (either by oversampling or KM) to gain more precision in estimates. Pragmatically, it seems sensible to try a number of approaches. Should they give similar results, the choice may be unimportant. Should results differ, further investigation may be needed in order to reveal more about the source of the disparity (Bryson et al., 2002).",

Comparing the incomparable must be avoided, i.e. only the subset of the comparison group that is comparable to the treatment group should be used in the analysis (Dehejia and Wahba, 1999). Hence, an important step is to check the overlap and the region of common support between treatment and comparison group. Several ways are suggested in the literature, where the most straightforward one is a visual analysis of the density distribution of the propensity score in both groups. Lechner (2001b) argues that given that the support problem can be spotted by inspecting the propensity score distribution, there is no need to implement a complicated estimator. However, some guidelines might help the researcher to determine the region of common support more precisely. We will present two methods, where the first one is essentially based on comparing the minima and maxima of the propensity score in both groups and the second one is based on estimating the density distribution in both groups. Implementing the common support condition ensures that any combination of characteristics observed in the treatment group can also be observed among the control group (Bryson et al., 2002). For ATT it is sufficient to ensure the existence of potential matches in the control group, whereas for ATE it is additionally required that the combinations of characteristics in the comparison group may also be observed in the treatment group (Bryson et al., 2002).",

To give an example let us assume for a moment that the propensity score lies within the interval [0.07, 0.94] in the treatment group and within [0.04, 0.89] in the control group. Hence, with the 'minima and maxima criterion', the common support is given by [0.07, 0.89]. Observations which lie outside this region are discarded from analysis. Clearly a two-sided test is only necessary if the parameter of interest is ATE; for ATT it is sufficient to ensure that for each participant a close nonparticipant can be found. It should also be clear that the common support condition is in some ways more important for the implementation of KM than it is for the implementation of NN matching, because with KM all untreated observations are used to estimate the missing counterfactual outcome, whereas with NN matching only the closest neighbour is used. Hence, NN matching (with the additional imposition of a maximum allowed caliper) handles the common support problem pretty well. There are some problems associated with the 'minima and maxima comparison', e.g. if there are observations at the bounds which are discarded even though they are very close to the bounds. Another problem arises if there are areas within the common support interval where there is only limited overlap between both groups, e.g. if in the region [0.51, 0.55] only treated observations can be found. Additionally problems arise if the density in the tails of the distribution is very thin, for example when there is a substantial distance from the smallest maximum to the second smallest element. Therefore, Lechner (2002) suggests to check the sensitivity of the results when the minima and maxima are replaced by the tenth smallest and tenth largest observation.",

So not only the P points for which the estimated density is exactly zero, but also an additional q percent of the remaining P points for which the estimated density is positive but very low are excluded: 14\u015c Figure 3 gives a hypothetical example and clarifies the differences between the two approaches. In the first example the propensity score distribution is highly skewed to the left (right) for participants (nonparticipants). Even though this is an extreme example, researchers are confronted with similar distributions in practice, too. With the 'minima and maxima comparison' we would exclude any observations lying outside the region of common support given by [0.2, 0.8]. Depending on the chosen trimming level q, we would maybe also exclude control observations in the interval [0.7, 0.8] and treated observations in the interval [0.2, 0.3] with the trimming approach since the densities are relatively low there. However, no large differences between the two approaches would emerge. In the second example we do not find any control individuals in the region [0.4, 0.7]. The 'minima and maxima comparison' fails in that situation, since minima and maxima in both groups are equal at 0.01 and 0.99. Hence, no observations would be excluded based on this criterion making the estimation of treatment effects in the region [0.4, 0.7] questionable. The trimming method on the other hand would explicitly exclude treated observations in that propensity score range and would therefore deliver more reliable results. 15 Hence, the choice of the method depends on the data situation at hand and before making any decisions a visual analysis is recommended.",

The basic idea of all approaches is to compare the situation before and after matching and check if there remain any differences after conditioning on the propensity score. If there are differences, matching on the score was not (completely) successful and remedial measures have to be done, e.g. by including interaction terms in the estimation of the propensity score.

This is a situation where programme participants are oversampled relative to their frequency in the population of eligible persons. This type of sampling design is frequently chosen in evaluation studies to reduce the costs of data collection and to get a larger number of treated individuals (Heckman and Todd, 2004). We discuss this point briefly and suggest one correction mechanism introduced by Heckman and Todd (2004). First of all, note that under choice-based sampling weights are required to consistently estimate the probability of programme participation. Since population weights are not known in most choicebased datasets used in evaluation analysis the propensity score cannot be consistently estimated (Heckman and Todd, 2004). However, Heckman and Todd (2004) show that even with population weights unknown, matching methods can still be applied. This is the case because the odds ratio estimated using the incorrect weights (those that ignore the fact of choice-based samples) is a scalar multiple of the true odds ratio, which is itself a monotonic transformation of propensity scores. Hence, matching can be done on the (misweighted) estimate of the odds ratio (or of the log odds ratio). Clearly, with single NN matching it does not matter whether matching is performed on the odds ratio or the estimated propensity score (with wrong weights), since ranking of the observations is identical and therefore the same neighbours will be selected. However, for methods that take account of the absolute distance between observations, e.g. KM, it does matter (Smith and Todd, 2005).",

The major goal is to ensure that participants and nonparticipants are compared in the same economic environment and the same individual lifecycle position. For example, when evaluating labour market policies one possible problem which has to be taken into account is the occurrence of locking-in effects. The literature is dominated by two approaches, comparing the individuals either from the beginning of the programme or after the end of the programme. To give an example let us assume that a programme starts in January and ends in June. The latter of the two alternatives implies that the outcome of participants who reenter the labour market in July is compared with matched nonparticipants in July. There are two shortcomings to this approach. First, if the exits of participants are spread over a longer time period, it might be the case that very different economic situations are compared. Second, a further problem which arises with this approach is that it entails an endogeneity problem (Gerfin and Lechner, 2002), since the abortion of the programme may be caused by several factors which are usually not observed by the researcher. 17 The above mentioned second approach is predominant in the recent evaluation literature (see e.g. Gerfin and Lechner, 2002;Sianesi, 2004) and measures the effects from the beginning of the programme. One major argument to do so concerns the policy relevance. In the above example the policy maker is faced with the decision to put an individual in January in a programme or not. He will be interested in the effect of his decision on the outcome of the participating individual in contrast with the situation if the individual would not have participated. Therefore comparing both outcomes from the beginning of the programme is a reasonable approach.",

First, the increased employment probability through the programme, and second, the reduced search intensity. 18 Since the two effects cannot be disentangled, we only observe the net effect and have to take this into account when interpreting the results. As to the fall in the search intensity, we should expect an initial negative effect from any kind of participation in a programme. However, a successful programme should overcompensate for this initial fall. So, if we are able to observe the outcome of the individuals for a reasonable time after the beginning/end of the programme, the occurrence of locking-in effects poses fewer problems but nevertheless has to be taken into account in the interpretation.",

These estimation steps add variation beyond the normal sampling variation (see the discussion in Heckman et al., 1998b). For example, in the case of NN matching with one NN, treating the matched observations as given will understate the standard errors (Smith, 2000). Things get more complicated, since a much discussed topic in the recent evaluation literature centres around efficiency bounds of the different approaches and how to reach them.

In the above cited paper Hahn (1998) shows that when using nonparametric series regression, adjusting for all covariates can achieve the efficiency bound, whereas adjusting for the propensity score does not. Hirano et al. (2003) show that weighting with the inverse of a nonparametric estimate of the propensity score can achieve the efficiency bound, too. Angrist and Hahn (2004) use the results from Hahn (1998) as a starting point for their analysis and note that conventional asymptotic arguments would appear to offer no justification for anything other than full control for covariates in estimation of ATEs. However, they argue that conventional asymptotic results can be misleading and provide poor guidance for researchers who face a finite sample. They develop an alternative theory and propose a panel-style estimator which can provide finite-sample efficiency gains over covariate and propensity score matching. Heckman et al. (1998b) analyse large sample properties of LPM estimators for the estimation of ATT. They show that these estimators are \u221a n-consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. This holds true when matching with respect to X, the known propensity score or the estimated propensity score. They conclude that none of the approaches dominates the others per se. In the case of matching on the known propensity score, the asymptotic variance of Var ATT is not necessarily smaller than that when matching on X. 20 Abadie and Imbens (2006a) analyse the asymptotic efficiency of n nearest neighbour matching when n is fixed, i.e. when the number of neighbours does not grow with increasing sample size. They show that simple matching estimators include a conditional bias term of order O(N \u22121/k ), where k is the number of continuous covariates. The bias does not disappear if k equals 2 and will dominate the large sample variance if k is at least 3. Hence, these estimators do not reach the variance bounds in (12) and (13) and are inefficient. They also describe a bias correction that removes the conditional bias asymptotically, making estimators \u221a nconsistent. Additionally, they suggest a new estimator for the variance that does not require consistent nonparametric estimation of unknown functions (we will present that approach further below). Imbens (2004) highlights some caveats of these results. First, it is important to make clear that only continuous covariates should be counted in dimension k, since with discrete covariates the matching will be exact in large samples. Second, if only treated individuals are matched and the number of potential controls is much larger than the number of treated individuals, it can be justified to ignore the bias by appealing to an asymptotic sequence where the number of potential controls increases faster than the number of treated individuals.",

Even though this is consistently possible and hence the asymptotic variance will be consistent, too, Imbens (2004) notes that this might be an additional computational burden. Hence, practical alternatives are called for and we are going to present three of them. Two of them, bootstrapping and the variance approximation by Lechner (2001a), are very common in the applied literature.

An early example of use can be found in Heckman et al. (1997a) who report bootstrap standard errors for LLM estimators. Other application examples for bootstrapping are for example Black and Smith (2004) for NN and KM estimators or Sianesi (2004) in the context of caliper matching. Each bootstrap draw includes the reestimation of the results, including the first steps of the estimation (propensity score, common support, etc.). Repeating the bootstrapping R times leads to R bootstrap samples and R estimated average treatment effects. The distribution of these means approximates the sampling distribution (and thus the standard error) of the population mean. Clearly, one practical problem arises because bootstrapping is very time consuming and might therefore not be feasible in some cases.",

However, combining evaluation methods is a straightforward way to improve their performance by eliminating remaining bias and/or improving precision. In this section we address three combined methods. First, we introduce an estimator which combines matching with the DID approach. By doing so, a possible bias due to time-invariant unobservables is eliminated. Second, we present a regression-adjusted matching estimator that combines matching with regression. This can be useful because matching does not address the relation between covariates and outcome. Additionally, if covariates appear seriously imbalanced after propensity score matching (inexact or imperfect matching) a biascorrection procedure after matching may help to improve estimates. Third, we present how weighting on the propensity score can be used to obtain a balanced sample of treated and untreated individuals. 23",

It extends the conventional DID estimator by defining outcomes conditional on the propensity score and using semiparametric methods to construct the differences. Therefore it is superior to DID as it does not impose linear functional form restrictions in estimating the conditional expectation of the outcome variable and it reweights the observations according to the weighting function of the matching estimator (Smith and Todd, 2005).

One approach to improve the propensity score weighting estimator is to normalize the weights to unity. If the propensity score is known, the estimator can directly by implemented. But, even in randomized settings where the propensity score is known, Hirano et al. (2003) show that it could be advantageous in terms of efficiency considerations to use the estimated rather than the 'true' propensity score. However, as Zhao (2004) notes, the way propensity scores are estimated is crucial when implementing weighting estimators and mis-specification of the propensity score may lead to substantial bias. 27 ",

            "text": "We have outlined in Section 2 that the estimation of treatment effects with matching estimators is based on the unconfoundedness or selection on observables assumption. However, if there are unobserved variables which affect assignment into treatment and the outcome variable simultaneously, a 'hidden bias' might arise (Rosenbaum, 2002). It should be clear that matching estimators are not robust against this 'hidden bias'. Researchers become increasingly aware that it is important to test the robustness of results to departures from the identifying assumption. Since it is not possible to estimate the magnitude of selection bias with nonexperimental data, the problem can be addressed by sensitivity analysis. Even though the idea for such analyses reaches far back in the literature only a few applied studies take them into account. However, it seems that this topic has come back into the mind of applied researchers and will become more important in the next few years. The aim of this section is to give a brief overview of some of the suggested methods. 28 One of the earliest examples for sensitivity analysis in the evaluation context can be found in Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983a). They propose to assess the sensitivity of ATE with respect to assumptions about an unobserved binary covariate that is associated both with the treatment and the response. The basic idea is that treatment is not unconfounded given the set of observable characteristics X but would be unconfounded given X and an unobservable covariate U. Based on different sets of assumptions about the distribution of U and its association with D and the outcomes Y (0) and Y (1) it is then possible to check the sensitivity of the results with respect to variations in these assumptions. Imbens (2003) builds on this approach but does not formulate the sensitivity in terms of coefficients on the unobserved covariate and rather presents the sensitivity results in terms of partial R 2 s. This eases the interpretation and additionally allows a comparison of the partial R 2 s of the unobserved covariates to those for the observed covariates in order to facilitate judgements regarding the plausibility of values necessary to substantially change results obtained under exogeneity. Both approaches use a parametric model as the basis for estimating ATEs. Parametrization is not needed, however, in the following two approaches.",

By changing the assumptions about the distribution of U, they can assess the robustness of the ATT with respect to different hypotheses on the nature of the confounding factor.

Those individuals that fall outside the region of common support have to be disregarded. But, deleting such observations yields an estimate that is only consistent for the subpopulation within the common support. However, information from those outside the common support could be useful and informative especially if treatment effects are heterogeneous. Lechner (2001b) describes an approach to check the robustness of estimated treatment effects due to failure of common support. He incorporates information from those individuals who failed the common support restriction to calculate nonparametric bounds of the parameter of interest, if all individuals from the sample at hand would have been included. To introduce his approach some additional notation is needed. Define the population of interest with which is some subset from the space defined by treatment status (D = 1 or D = 0) and a set of covariates X . ATT is defined by {(D = 1) \u00d7 X } and W ATT is a binary variable which equals one if an observation belongs to ATT . Identification of the effect is desired for \u03c4 ATT ( ATT ). Due to missing common support the effect can only be estimated for \u03c4 ATT ( ATT * ). This is the effect ignoring individuals from the treatment group without a comparable match. Observations within common support are denoted by the binary variable W ATT * equal to one. The subset for whom such effect is not identified is AT T . Let Pr(W ATT * = 1|W ATT = 1) denote the share of participants within common support relative to the total number of participants and \u03bb 1 0 be the mean of Y(1) for individuals from the treatment group outside common support. Assume that the share of participants within common support relative to the total number of participants as well as ATT for those within the common support and \u03bb 1 0 are identified. Additionally, assume that the potential outcome Y(0) is bounded: Pr(Y \u2264 Y (0) \u2264 Y |W AT T * = 0, W AT T = 1) = 1. 29 Given these assumptions, the bounds for ATT \u03c4 AT T ( AT T ) \u2208 [\u03c4 AT T ( AT T ), \u03c4 AT T ( AT T )] can be written as",

What we have discussed so far is basically a static and binary evaluation framework where an individual can participate in one programme (or not). However, in most realistic evaluation settings this framework might not be appropriate, e.g. when evaluating the effects of labour market policies. First of all, researchers are usually not confronted with only one, but a different set of programmes (programme heterogeneity). Second, an unemployed can successively enter into different programmes as long as (s)he is unemployed. Finally, choosing the right control group and the problem of random programme starts is a recently much discussed topic in the evaluation literature, too.

Problems occur because the assignment into a subsequent programme is not independent of the assignment into previous programmes. Additionally, outcomes in subsequent periods will be influenced by previous participation decisions. Hence, a dynamic selection problem arises. Most empirical work about dynamic selection problems ignores intermediate outcomes and treats the sequence participation as being determined from the start. Mainly, problems are circumvented by either estimating the effect of the first programme only (see e.g. Gerfin and Lechner, 2002) or applying the static framework subsequently (see e.g. Bergemann et al., 2001). The sequential matching framework is a powerful tool and is applicable for situations where individuals can participate more than once in a programme and where it is possible to identify treatment sequences. It allows intermediate outcomes to play a role in the participation decision for sequential participation and thus allows estimation in a dynamic context. To our knowledge Lechner (2004) is the only application so far and hence practical experiences with sequential matching estimators are rather limited.",

In the 'usual' evaluation set-up for matching estimators, we have a group of participants and a group of nonparticipants. Both groups are usually observed from a certain starting point t to an end point T. The researcher does not have any information outside this limited time interval. Controls are defined as those individuals who did not participate in any programme in [t, T ], whereas participants are those individuals who took part in a programme for a certain interval \u03c4 in [t, T ]. In a series of papers, Sianesi (2001Sianesi ( , 2004 casts doubt if this standard approach is appropriate. She suggests a solution which is based on a redefinition of the control group. Instead of defining controls as those who never participate, she defines controls as those who did not participate until a certain time period. Hence, the corresponding parameter of interest in this setting is then defined as the effect of joining a programme now in contrast to waiting longer. Fredriksson and Johansson (2004) formalize her approach and argue that the standard way of defining a control group might lead to biased results, because the unconfoundedness assumption might be violated. The reason for this is that in the standard approach the treatment indicator itself is defined conditional on future outcomes. In fact, in the context of labour market policies it can be argued that an unemployed individual will join a programme at some time, provided his unemployment spell is long enough (Sianesi, 2004). Hence, if the reason for nonparticipation is that the individual has found a job before a participation in the programme was offered or considered, it leads to negatively biased effects.",

We have argued that the decision should be based on economic theory, a sound knowledge of previous research and also information about the institutional settings. We have also presented several statistical strategies which may help to determine the choice. If it is felt that some variables play a specifically important role in determining participation and outcomes, one can use an 'overweighting' strategy, for example by carrying out matching on subpopulations.",

The performance of different matching algorithms varies case-by-case and depends largely on the data sample. If results among different algorithms differ substantially, further investigations may be needed to reveal the source of disparity. The discussion has also emphasized that treatment effects can only be estimated in the region of common support. To identify this region we recommend to start with a visual analysis of the propensity score distributions in the treatment and comparison group. Based on that, different strategies can be applied to implement the common support condition, e.g. by 'minima and maxima comparison' or 'trimming', where the latter approach has some advantages when observations are close to the 'minima and maxima' bounds and if the density in the tails of the distribution is very thin.",

If the quality indicators are not satisfactory, one should go back to step 1 of the implementation procedure and include higher-order or interaction terms of the existing covariates or choose different covariates (if available). If, after that, the matching quality is still not acceptable, this may indicate a lack of comparability of the two groups being examined.

            "text": "To conclude, we have discussed several issues surrounding the implementation of PSM. We hope to give some guidance for researchers who believe that their data are strong enough to credibly justify the unconfoundedness assumption and who want to use PSM. 9. See e.g. Breiman et al. (1984) for a theoretical discussion and Heckman et al. (1998a) or Smith and Todd (2005) for applications. 10. See Smith and Todd (2005) or Imbens (2004) for more technical details. 11. This shortcoming is circumvented by an optimal full matching estimator which works backwards and rearranges already matched treated individuals if some specific treated individual turns out to be a better (closer) match for an untreated previously matched individual (see Gu and Rosenbaum (1993) or Augurzky and Kluve (2007) for detailed descriptions). 12. It should be noted that the increase in the variance is due to the imposition of the common support and hence variance comparisons between matching estimators with and without caliper are not obvious. 13. The trimming method was first suggested by Heckman et al. (1997aHeckman et al. ( , 1998a. 14. For details on how to estimate the cut-off trimming level see Smith and Todd (2005). Galdo (2004) notes that the determination of the smoothing parameter is critical here. If the distribution is skewed to the right for participants and skewed to the left for nonparticipants, assuming a normal distribution may be very misleading. 15. In a most recent paper Crump et al. (2005) point out that both methods presented here are somewhat informal in the sense that they rely on arbitrary choices regarding thresholds for discarding observations. They develop formal methods for addressing lack of support and especially provide new estimators based on a redefinition of the estimand. 16. Smith and Todd (2005) note that this theorem holds for any X, including those that do not satisfy the CIA required to justify matching. As such, the theorem is not informative about which set of variables to include in X. 17. It may be the case for example that a participant receives a job offer and refuses to participate because he thinks the programme is not enhancing his employment prospects or because lack of motivation. As long as the reasons for abortion are not identified, an endogeneity problem arises. 18. These ideas data back to Becker (1964) who makes the point that human capital investments are composed of an investment period, in which one incurs the opportunity cost of not working, and a payoff period, in which ones employment and/or wage are higher than they would have been without the investment. 19. Hahn (1998) shows that the propensity score does not play a role for the estimation of ATE, but knowledge of the propensity score matters for the estimation of ATT. 20. Whereas matching on X involves k-dimensional nonparametric regression function estimation (where k = 1, . . . , K are the number of covariates), matching on P(X) only involves one-dimensional nonparametric regression function estimation. Thus from the perspective of bias, matching on P(X) is preferable, since it allows \u221a nconsistent estimation of \u03c4 ATT for a wider class of models (Heckman et al., 1998b). 21. See Brownstone and Valletta (2001) for a discussion of bootstrapping methods. 22. See Abadie and Imbens (2006a) and Abadie et al. (2004) for details about the derivation of the relevant formulas and some easy implementable examples. 23. Due to space constraints we cannot address all possible combinations. For a combination of propensity score methods with an instrumental variable approach the interested reader is referred to Abadie (2003), and how to combine DID with weighting on the propensity score has been recently proposed by Abadie (2005). 24. Smith and Todd (2005) present a variant of this estimator when repeated crosssection data are used instead of panel data. With repeated cross-section data the identity of future participants and nonparticipants may not be known in t , Blundell and Costa Dias (2000) suggest a solution for that case. 25. See e.g. Imbens (2004) or Wooldridge (2004), Section 18.3.2, for a formal description of weighting on propensity score estimators. 26. See Imbens (2004) for a formal proof that this weighting estimator removes the bias due to different distributions of the covariates between treated and untreated individuals. 27. In the recent methodological literature several estimators have been proposed that combine weighting on propensity score estimators with other methods. Due to space limitations we cannot address these topics. The interested reader is referred to for example Hirano and Imbens (2002) who apply a combined weighting on propensity score and regression adjustment estimator in their analysis or Abadie (2005) who combines DID and weighting estimators. 28. See Ichino et al. (2006) or Imbens (2004) for a more detailed discussion of these topics. 29. For example, if the outcome variable of interest is a dummy variable, Y (0) is bounded in [0,1]. 30. See Lechner and Miquel (2005) and Lechner (2004) for a sequential (three-periods, two-treatments) matching framework.",
