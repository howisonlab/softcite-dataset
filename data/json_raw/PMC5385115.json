Concomitant fractures are defi ned as at least 2 acute short-tau inversion recovery (STIR-) positive vertebral fractures that happen concomitantly. A previous fracture is a STIR-negative fracture at the time of initial diagnostics. Logistic regression was used to examine the infl uence of various variables on the incidence of concomitant fractures."

The odds ratio (OR) for concomitant fractures decreased with a higher number of previous fractures (OR = 0.86; p = 0.03) and higher dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry T-score (OR = 0.72; p = 0.003)."

Risk factors for concomitant fractures are a low T-score and a low number of previous vertebral fractures in cases of osteoporotic vertebral fracture. An MRI scan of the the complete thoracic and lumbar spine with STIR sequence reduces the risk of under-diagnosis and under-treatment."

Plain radiography and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the thoracic and/or lumbar spine are often performed. Patients with osteoporosis often show multiple fractures distributed over the whole spine. Differentiation of single acute and concomitant AOVFs from previous fractures is diffi cult, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most adequate image modality for this question. MRI may also reveal occult AOVFs (Park et al. 2013, Biber et al. 2016. The resources for using MRI are limited. In addition, it is still unclear whether using MRI of the spine in patients with AOVF can improve clinical outcome through higher diagnostic accuracy. The distribution of AOVFs is not well investigated, and a better understanding of the location of concomitant and previous fractures may lead to adapted and improved imaging standards.",

            "text": "The reason for the vulnerability of the thoracolumbar junction derives from the transition from thoracic kyphosis to lumbar lordosis and from the change from the relatively wellfi xed thoracic spine to the free lumbar spine (Buhren 2001). The defi nition of the thoracolumbar junction varies in clinical studies between being T10 to L2 (Knop et al. 1999, Wood et al. 2003, Park et al. 2013 and being T11 to L2 (Buhren 2001). We defi ned the thoracolumbar junction as being between T10 and L2, as this is the most frequently used extent of the thoracolumbar junction in clinical studies. Also, in the present study the L1 vertebra was the most common single acute, concomitant, and previously fractured vertebra, followed by T12. In accordance with this, the thoracolumbar junction was the most frequently affected fracture location.  We defi ned an acute single or concomitant AOVF to be when MRI showed a high STIR and a low T1w signal, whereas previous fractures had a low STIR and a low T1w signal. This is in accordance with radiological standards for differentiation between acute and previous vertebral fractures (Park et al. 2013). There are still no standardized international guidelines for image modalities in patients with AOVFs and the German Osteoporosis Society (DVO) recommends plain radiographs, CT scan, MRI, and scintigraphy-but has not given standards (DVO 2014). If clinicians suspect concomitant or occult AOVFs and if patients have risk factors for concomitant fractures, an MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine would appear to be time-and cost-effective for diagnosis of concomitant AOVFs, as more than 99% of all OVFs in our study occurred in these spinal regions. A study on multiple vertebral compression fractures also recommended doing an MRI scan of the thoracic and lumbar spine in patients with osteoporosis and low back pain (Kano et al. 2012). Up to 65% of OVFs are overlooked if physicians rule out spine MRI (Park et al. 2013). As about 70% of osteoporotic vertebral fractures are asymptomatic or do not show acute onset of pain (Nevitt et al. 1998), the clinical usefulness of diagnosing a higher number of OVFs is questionable.",

Knowing about risk factors for concomitant AOVFs could help physicians reduce the number of overlooked occult AOVFs. A high amount of previous fractures decreases the risk of concomitant fractures and increases the risk of single AOVFs. This could be due to a high number of fractured and sclerosed vertebral bodies that reduce the number of vertebral bodies which can easily fracture simultaneously.",

            "text": "The mechanism that leads to the lumbar drift of AOVFs following previous fractures is not fully understood. In studies on spinal load after osteoporotic vertebral wedge fractures treated with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, the most important risk factors for subsequent vertebral fractures were the anterior shift of the upper adjacent vertebral body and the spinopelvic imbalance, especially the segmental kyphotic angle (Rohlmann et al. 2006, Baek et al. 2015. This leads to an increased intradiscal pressure, increased endplate stress, and increased force in the erector spinae-and it induces increased spinal load with higher fracture risk in osteoporotic vertebrae adjacent to augmented vertebrae. Thus, adjacent fractures may not be caused by the altered stiffness of the polymethyl methacrylate-(PMMA-)augmented vertebrae, but mainly by the altered mechanical spinal load (Rohlmann et al. 2006, Qin et al. 2014. The increased vertebral load after wedge fractures may also be the cause of subsequent adjacent fractures in nonaugmented fractured vertebrae. This is supported by a study that evaluated the effect of kyphotic deformity because of a wedge-shaped vertebral fracture. The authors concluded that a T12 vertebral body fracture leads to an increase in stress on adjacent vertebrae, with bimodal peaks in the midthoracic spine and in 2 superior vertebrae (Okamoto et al. 2015). By contrast, in REPAPORA the most frequent fracture following a previous fracture was the caudal gap fracture. The slightly but statistically signifi cant increase in fractures in the vertebral bodies below a previous fracture may be due to kyphotic deformity and increased spinal load in the more caudal vertebral bodies, leading to the lumbar drift with more lumbarlocalized OVFs.",

In addition, we did not differentiate between different types of AOVFs, which may vary in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine and infl uence the type, frequency, and location of subsequent fractures.
