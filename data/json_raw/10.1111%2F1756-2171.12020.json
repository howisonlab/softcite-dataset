Using data on trade and litigation of individually owned patents in the United States, we exploit variation in capital gains tax rates across states as an instrument to identify the causal effect of trade on litigation. We find that taxes strongly affect patent transactions, and that trade reduces litigation on average, but the impact is heterogeneous. Patents with larger potential gains from trade are more likely to change ownership, and the impact depends critically on transaction characteristics.",

They do this by shaping the division of labor, and the nature of competition, between small firms (or individuals) which typically specialize in innovation but lack the capacity for large-scale development, production, and marketing, and large firms, whose comparative advantage lies in the commercialization of these inventions (Gans and Stern, 2000;Gans, Hsu, and Stern, 2002).

            "text": "Despite these private and social benefits, there is growing concern voiced in both academic and policy debates about the potentially deleterious effects of patent transactions. The modern innovation landscape is characterized by a large number of patents, with often fuzzy boundaries and fragmented ownership (Bessen and Meurer, 2008). The main concern is that, in this environment, patent transactions can deter innovation if they take place in order to extract rents through patent litigation, rather than to facilitate welfare-enhancing technology transfers. This issue is at the center of a recent report by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (2011), and the Supreme Court has raised similar concerns in a recent, prominent case (MercExchange, L.L.C. v. eBay, Inc., 126 S. Ct. 1837, 2006. 1 However, there is sharp disagreement among economic and legal scholars about the scope and severity of this problem. For example, Mann (2005) claims that the detrimental effects from patent transactions are minimal, whereas Lemley and Shapiro (2007), among others, argue that patent transactions constitute a serious threat of ex post holdup for manufacturing firms, discouraging investment and innovation and requiring policy intervention in the form of limits to patent enforcement for nonpracticing entities. 2 Some have even gone so far as to recommend more draconian reductions in permissible patenting, especially in relation to software patents. 3 Despite the importance of these issues, there are no empirical studies of the impact of the market for patents on patent litigation. Indeed, this lack of empirical evidence led the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, in April 2011, to amend the patent reform bill (H.R. 1249, The America Invents Act) to require the comptroller general of the United States to study the impact of patent transactions and litigation on innovation.",

The economics and management literature typically associates the gains from trade in patent transactions with vertical specialization (Teece, 1986;Arora, Fosfuri, and Gambardella, 2001) and comparative advantages in manufacturing or marketing (Arora and Ceccagnoli, 2006). By raising the potential profit from the innovations, these mechanisms imply that market reallocation of patent rights should increase the likelihood of litigation. In this article, we identify a novel source of private, and social, gains from tradecomparative advantage in patent enforcement. The market for innovation can reduce litigation if it reallocates patents to entities that are more effective at resolving disputes over these rights without resorting to the courts. 4 A third, more controversial motivation for patent transactions is patent trolling-acquisition of patent rights for later use against existing manufacturing firms. If this is the driving force behind patent transactions, we would also expect to observe that a change of ownership raises the likelihood of litigation on the traded patent.",

Other policy proposals are currently being examined by the federal government.

The empirical challenge in studying how reallocation of patent rights affects litigation is the endogeneity of patent trading. To address this concern, we exploit a provision in the U.S. tax law that allows us to use variation in capital gains tax rates across states and over time as an instrument to identify the causal effect of a change in patent ownership on litigation. Under U.S. law, for an individual patent holder, the profits from the sale of a patent are taxed as capital gains, whereas any damage awards from litigation are taxed as ordinary income. This means that capital gains tax rates affect the incentives to sell patents for individual owners, but not their incentives to undertake patent litigation, and are thus a suitable instrument for change in ownership in the patent litigation regression. This identification strategy means that we can only study patents that are originally owned by individual inventors in this article.",

It is straightforward to introduce taxes into the analysis. If the individual owner commercializes the patent, the profits are taxed at the personal income tax rate \u03c4 I . If the patent is traded to the firm, the product market profits are taxed at the corporate income tax rate \u03c4 C . If the individual owner sells the patent, the gains from the transaction are taxed at the capital gains tax rate \u03c4 G . This setup conforms to the U.S. tax code (see Section 4 for more details).

Higher capital gains and corporate taxes reduce the likelihood that patent rights are reallocated, and higher (personal) income tax rates increase it. We test these predictions in the empirical analysis and exploit the capital gains tax rate as an instrument for trade based on it being excluded from the condition determining litigation. 8 To see how litigation is affected by a change in patent ownership, let NewOwner be an indicator variable equal to one if the patent changes ownership and zero otherwise. If individual A does not sell the patent, the probability of litigation is Pr(Litigation|NewOwner = 0) = (\u03c0 A , e A ).

The effect of trade can be either positive or negative, depending on the difference (\u03c0 A , e A ) \u2212 (\u03c0 B , e B ). Previous literature associates the surplus generated by patent trades with gains from vertical specialization or comparative advantages in manufacturing or marketing. In our model, this commercialization hypothesis corresponds to the case where \u03c0 A < \u03c0 B and e A = e B = e. Because \u2202 (\u03c0 i , e i )/\u2202\u03c0 i > 0, in this case the change in patent ownership is unambiguously associated with an increase in patent litigation, because (\u03c0 B , e) \u2212 (\u03c0 A , e) > 0. Intuitively, in this scenario trade increases the product market profits generated by the patent but does not alter the enforcement capability of the owner. Because an increase in patent value increases the likelihood of patent litigation (Galasso and Schankerman, 2010), trade increases litigation rates if it is only motivated by product market gains.",

In the patent context, there are two main reasons why patentees may vary in their likelihood to enforce the patent without filing a suit. First, patent owners may have different abilities to exchange intellectual property through licensing or cross-licensing agreements (Hall and Ziedonis, 2001). Second, not all owners may be able to generate an expectation of repeated interaction large enough to sustain cooperation over time. Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004) provide evidence in support of these two mechanisms, showing that firms with large patent portfolios are less likely to file a suit on any individual patent in their portfolio (controlling for patent characteristics).",

First, we assumed that infringement does not occur between the seller and the buyer. However, it is possible that patent trades occur as the outcome of patent infringement or invalidity disputes. To accommodate this, in Appendix A, we develop an extension to our model that includes the possibility of infringement between buyer and seller, and we show that our identification strategy still holds. The intuition behind this is that, also in this extended model, higher capital gains and corporate taxes reduce the payoff of a patent transaction and thus the likelihood that patent rights are reallocated, whereas higher (personal) income tax rates increase it. This extension of the model, however, introduces an additional mechanism by which the reallocation of patent ownership reduces litigation. There are now two distinct mechanisms: the first is the differential ability of the buyer and the seller to settle disputes with third parties (this was the original channel); the second, new channel is avoidance of litigation between the buyer and the seller involved in the patent dispute.",

Moreover, our result that the capital gains tax rate does not affect the individual's litigation decision directly also holds in this generalized setup.

A typical reassignment entry indicates the patent involved, the name of the buyer (assignee), the name of the seller (assignor), the date at which the reassignment was recorded at the patent office, and the date at which the private agreement between the parties was signed. The data set covers the period 1983-2001. Under Section 261 of the U.S. Patent Act, recording the assignment protects the patent owner against previous unrecorded interests and subsequent assignments. If the patentee does not record the assignment, subsequent recorded assignments will take priority.

We also drop transfers to financial institutions to eliminate transactions (recorded in the USPTO Patent Assignment database) in which a patent is used as collateral. 10 Another concern is that the first assignment of an unassigned patent may not correspond to a trade but rather to the transfer of ownership from the inventor to the company in which the inventor works.

The data set contains 14,169 patent cases filed during the period 1975-2000. For each of these case filings, the data set reports detailed information on the main patent litigated, the patentee, the infringer, and the court dealing with the case.

Moreover, patent transactions characterized by large enforcement gains will reallocate the patent to owners with large \u03b8 i .

This concern is less relevant in Tax data. Information on state and federal income and capital gains taxes is obtained from the NBER Tax Rates database. This contains marginal income tax rates by year and state for a representative household with $500,000 of wage income. 13 The data set also reports maximum federal and state long-term capital gains tax rates by year and state, computed using the NBER TAXSIM model. We obtain information on the maximum federal and state corporate marginal tax rates, for each year and state, from two government publications: the Significant Features of Fiscal Federalism, available for the period 1982-1995(American Council on Intergovernmental Relations, 1982-1995 and the Book of the States, for the period 1996-2000(Council of State Governments, 1996-2000. For each assigned patent in our data set, we use the ordinary income and capital gains marginal tax rates in the state of the initial patent assignee. For unassigned patents, we used the state of the primary inventor as identified by the USPTO. To measure tax rates faced by potential corporate buyers, we construct a weighted average of state corporate taxes where state weights are determined by the fraction of state patent applications in the technology class of the patent. 14 Matching data on income and capital gains taxes to patents is meaningful as long as the patent is owned by an individual at the time of the transaction. To ensure this, we focus our analysis on the first transfer of a patent. Subsequent owners are generally not individuals and thus are not subject to either personal income or capital gains taxation on the patent transaction. Focusing on the first transfer involves dropping very few patent trades. Most of the traded patents in our data are traded only once (94.9%), and only 0.15% of traded patents are traded more than three times.",

Table 1A shows the fraction of sample patents involved in trade or litigation at least once in their life. Of the total sample, 4.55% of patents are traded and 0.69% are involved in at least one suit. These rates are low, but it is worth noting that, for the later patents in the sample, data on trade and litigation are truncated, and this biases downward litigation and trade rates. 16 Moreover, patents that are traded or litigated are much more valuable than those that are not (as measured by citations received). 17 The striking fact from this table is the strong association between trading and litigation. Of patents that are traded, 4.2% are also litigated; for patents that are not traded, the litigation rate is only 0.51%. Of patents that are litigated, 27.9% are also traded; for patents that are not litigated, only 4.4% are traded. Table 1B, illustrates the combined (state plus federal) individual and corporate tax rates averaged across states for four five-year time periods. There is a substantial decline in income tax rates in the late 1980s and an increase in the early 1990s. Conversely, there is an increase in capital gains tax rates in the late 1980s and a decrease in the late 1990s. The summary statistics show the range of variation across U.S. states. The difference between the lowest and the highest capital gains tax rates across states ranges from 7 to 9 percentage points (depending on the year). The difference between the minimum and the maximum income tax rate across states is 6-16 percentage points. Corporate tax rates decline during the sample period, and the difference between the lowest and highest rates is 12-15 percentage points. 18 Analysis of variance shows Note: Our sample includes all patents granted to U.S. individuals and corporations for the period 1985-2000. Patent citations received: mean number of the truncation-adjusted forward cites (see Hall et al., 2001). The trade rate is the proportion of patents that were traded at least once in the sample. The trade weighted by cites is a sample mean computed assigning weights to patents based on their number of patent citations received. The annual litigation rate is the predicted probability that a patent will be involved in litigation in a given year. This probability was obtained using the coefficients of a probit model of the decision to litigate a patent, controlling for age, technology and year dummies, and evaluated at the sample means of the covariates. Technology dummies represent the 36 technology subcatagories defined in Hall et al. (2001). Small firms are those with five or fewer patents in a given year (see Serrano, 2010, for details).

If we exclude patents granted to foreign entities and government agencies, individually owned patents account for about 22% of the remaining sample. In Table 2, we compare sample means of the number of citations received for individually owned and corporate patents, granted in the 15-year window 1985-2000 for which we also obtained data on litigation and reassignment of corporate patents. We distinguish between small corporate innovators (defined following Serrano, 2010, as entities applying for fewer than five patents in a calendar year) and other corporate innovators. On average, individually owned patents receive fewer citations than corporate patents. Nonetheless, if we focus on traded patents, we see only very minor differences in citations across the three ownership types (this is particularly important because traded patents are key for the identification of the effect of trade in our fixed effects regressions). 19 Table 2 also examines the differences in the likelihood of trade and litigation. The fraction of corporate patents that are traded is three times as large as those of individually owned patents. However, there is essentially no difference between trade rates of individuals and small firms once we weight patents by citations (this is consistent with the evidence in Serrano, 2010, that shows greater evidence of selection into trade for individuals and small firms). For each of the ownership types, we also constructed annual litigation rates. The litigation rates for individuals and small innovators are quite similar. At the same time, consistent with the findings in Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004), there is a substantially lower litigation rate for larger corporate innovators. Overall, these figures indicate that individually owned patents are not sharply different from corporate-owned patents, especially those of small patenting firms.",

To show this, we focus on patents that are eventually traded (in our sample period). In Figure 1, we compare the probability of being involved in at least one suit prior to and after the date at which trade occurs. In aggregate, a patent that has not been traded but that will be traded in its lifetime is involved in at least one suit in that year with probability 0.61%. A patent that has already changed ownership is involved in at least one suit with probability 0.48%. The posttrade litigation probability is lower after trade even after we condition on age. For example, a patent that has not yet been traded at age 7 is involved in at least one dispute with probability 0.76%, whereas for a patent of the same age that has already been traded, the litigation rate is about that level (0.43%). In short, Figure 1 suggests that the reallocation of patent rights is temporally related to lower litigation risk.

Specifically, we searched for tax changes that were both sizeable (i.e., tax cuts higher than 1 percentage age point and tax hikes larger than 2 percentage points, which approximately correspond to the top quartile of the distributions) and that were not confounded by other capital gains and corporate tax changes within a six-year window. 20 We exploit these events to compare the changes in trade rates between individually owned patents and corporate-owned patents, which are used as the control group (because trade for them is unaffected by capital gains taxes), before and after a tax change. We do this separately for tax cuts and tax hikes. This leads to the familiar difference-in-differences estimator. In these regressions, we control for additive fixed effects for patent age, years, technology subcategories, and states, as well as for the level of corporate and income taxes (sum of state and federal rates). Unreported regressions show that the trading of individually owned patents, relative to the corporate patent control group, decreases when there is a capital gains tax hike and increases with a tax cut, and these effects are strongly statistically significant. The estimated treatment effects are 0.009 (with standard error equal to 0.002) for a capital gains tax cut and \u22120.010 (with standard error equal to 0.002) for a tax hike. These effects are large, corresponding to about 80% of the mean probability of trading for individually owned patents. Figure 2 depicts the point estimates from a more general empirical specification that allow the treatment effect to vary for each year before and after the tax event. We normalize the coefficient to zero for the year preceding the tax event, as is common practice. We also depict the estimated 95% confidence bands. In the upper panel, which examines the effects of cuts in the state capital gains tax rate, we see no statistically significant \"treatment effects\" in the years prior to the date of the tax changes. The estimated coefficients are not individually statistically different from zero (even though the point estimates rise somewhat), and we also do not reject the hypothesis that they are jointly equal to zero (p value = .19). This result indicates that there is a common trend for individual and corporate patents prior to the treatment. However, the estimated treatment effects for the two years immediately after the tax cuts are positive and statistically significant-there is a sharp increase in the relative trading rate for individually owned patents. The lower panel presents the effects of the tax hikes. Although the point estimates of the \"treatment effect\" decline before the tax increase, these are not statistically different from zero separately or jointly (p value = .25 for the joint test), but after the tax hike there is a statistically significant decline in the trading rate for individually owned patents relative to the corporate patent control group. 21",

Among these tax events, we can construct a six-year window only for events in the period 1986-1998, which leads us to 46 tax changes out of 52 (14 tax cuts and 32 tax hikes). Moreover, we focus on capital gains tax events with no contemporaneous changes of the state-level corporate tax rate in the six-year window. This reduces the number of tax events to 26 (12 tax cuts and 14 tax hikes). Finally, we consider tax events that involve a tax cut with no confounding tax hike in the six-year window, and similarly for tax hikes. This reduces the sample to eight \"clean\" tax events (4 tax cuts and 4 tax hikes). These tax cuts take place in Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and Virginia, and the tax hikes in Connecticut, South Carolina, and Wisconsin (in two different years).",

To do this, in each of the difference-in-differences regressions, we include both an intercept dummy for individually owned patents as before and an interactive dummy between individually owned patents and a time trend variable. We find that the estimated effect of tax changes is robust to the inclusion of the differential trends.We also tried an even more flexible specification that allows for an interaction between the dummy for individually owned patents and a piece wise linear trend (with the same four sub periods as used in the article).

More importantly, the coefficient on the traded dummy, \u03b1, can be rewritten as \u03b2(X k \u2212 X j ). This has two implications. First, we can interpret the coefficient on trade as the impact that the change in ownership characteristics (if unobservable to the econometrician) has on patent litigation. If we were able to control for all the owner characteristics that affect litigation risk, the coefficient \u03b1 should be zero. The second implication is that \u03b1 will differ from zero only if two conditions hold: first, there are unobservable owner characteristics that affect litigation outcomes (i.e., \u03b2 = 0) and, second the market for innovation reallocates patents to entities that differ substantially in these characteristics (i.e., X k = X j ). 23 Previous literature on patent litigation confirms that owner characteristics substantially affect litigation risk (e.g., Lanjouw andSchankerman, 2001, 2004), but there is no existing research on the link between the reallocation of patent rights and litigation risk.

In the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, individuals face a lower tax rate on capital gains (from sales of assets) than on ordinary (\"earned\") income. U.S. corporations do not receive this preferential tax rate on capital gains (Desai and Gentry, 2004). According to Section 1235 of the Internal Revenue Code, the transfer of a patent by an individual is treated as the sale of a capital asset and is subject to capital gains taxes. On the other hand, patent litigation damages (and licensing royalties) are taxed as ordinary income. This treatment of litigation damages is acknowledged in a number of tax court decisions (Maine and Nguyen, 2003). This means that the decision to trade a patent will be affected by the capital gains tax rate, but the decision to litigate will not. We limit the analysis in this article to trades of individually owned patents because this tax distinction does not apply to patent sales by corporations, so unfortunately we cannot use this instrumental variable for transfers of company-owned patents.",

In this extended model, the patent fixed effects, i , still capture the combined effect of the time-invariant unobservable characteristics of the initial owner, \u03b2 X j , and the time-invariant patent characteristics, \u03bc i (i.e., i = \u03b2 X j + \u03bc i ). The coefficient on the traded dummy, \u03b1, can still be rewritten as \u03b2(X k \u2212 X j ), and measures the impact that the change in unobservable ownership characteristics has on patent litigation. This extension also implies that if the econometrician is able to observe all the patent characteristics that have an impact on litigation (i.e., X ot is empty), then \u03b1 would be equal to zero.",

We use p it to construct an estimate of the probability of not having changed ownership up to age t, P it , for the entire sample of observations. This estimate satisfies two important properties. First, P it depends on capital gains tax rates Z it , which are assumed to be uncorrelated with the likelihood of patent litigation (except through changes in ownership). Specifically, we expect larger capital gains tax rates to reduce the probability of a change in ownership. 24 Second, P it is equal to the expected value of NewOwner it , conditional on the current value and past sequences of Z it and X it . These properties allow us to exploit P it as an instrumental variable to estimate the effect of trade on litigation (Angrist, 2001;Angrist and Pischke, 2009). Newey (1990) and Wooldridge (2002) argue that this instrumental variable (IV) estimator is asymptotically efficient in the class of estimators where the IVs are functions of Z it and X it .

The first three columns present estimates using the full sample (including patents that are not traded and/or litigated). In column 1, where we do not include any controls, the coefficient on the NewOwner dummy is positive and significant. However, this result is likely due to selection into trading, because more valuable patents are both more likely to be traded and litigated. 25 In column 2, we include patent fixed effects in the specification to control for this possibility. This specification makes use only of within-patent litigation variation. Once fixed effects are included, the coefficient becomes negative and significant, indicating that a patent is less likely to be involved in a suit after it changes ownership.

Also in this smaller sample, we find a negative correlation between trading and litigation, but it is not statistically significant. 28 We also looked at the relationship between trade and litigation for small corporate innovators. As for individual inventors, we find a positive (but insignificant) correlation between trade and litigation when we do not include patent fixed effects, but the correlation becomes negative once we control for patent fixed effects. The magnitude of the correlation is very similar to the one estimated for individually owned patents (\u22120.016 and p < 0.01), further suggesting that the two samples are quite similar.",

As we argued above, there are a number of reasons why we should expect unobservable factors to affect both the trading and litigation decisions. This intuition is confirmed by a Rivers-Vuong test that provides strong evidence against the exogeneity of patent trade. 29 To address this endogeneity, we will now construct an instrument that relies on the effect of capital gains taxes on patent trading. 26 To perform the test, we run a random effects panel regression with additional covariates. The additional controls are the number of citations made by the patent, the number of citations received, the number of claims, and the technology class of the patent. The coefficient on NewOwner is positive and significant in the random effects specification (\u03b2 = 0.003, p value < 0.01). The estimate from the fixed effects specification is negative and significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.002, p value < 0.01). We strongly reject that the two estimates are equal (\u03c7 2 20 = 1878.19, p value < 0.01). 27 In this regression, we add dummies for four subperiods: before 1986, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, and after 1995. In a more general specification with a dummy for each year and no age dummies, we do not reject the joint hypothesis that the individual year coefficients can be summarized by these four period dummies. Results are very similar if we drop the period dummies and control only for for age and patent fixed effects. 28 We observe a similar negative correlation even when we drop the unassigned patents and focus on patents that are assigned to a U.S. individual at their grant date (14,576 patents). The correlation between trade and litigation is negative and significant at the 5% level. The confidence interval of the coefficient on trade overlaps with the one estimated in the large sample.",

The dependent variable is an indicator variable, Trade, that equals one only in the year in which the patent changes ownership. Because tax rates affect the initial owner incentives to sell the patent up to the time at which the patent is sold, we estimate these regressions, dropping all observations that follow the first change in ownership. In all the regressions, we control for a range of observable patent characteristics, including the number of citations received by the patent, a measure of the patent generality, technology class (36 two-digit subcategories), plus year and age fixed effects. Because the main variable of interest (capital gains tax rates) varies at the state-year level, we report state-level block bootstrapped standard errors (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan, 2004). 30 Column 1 presents the estimates of the probit model (8). The regression confirms that higher capital gains and corporate tax rates reduce the likelihood that patent rights are traded, and higher income tax rates increase it. These results are consistent with the predictions of the model presented in Section 2. The estimated marginal effects imply large tax impacts. The elasticity of the probability of trade with respect to the capital gains tax rate is \u22121.62. The corresponding elasticities for the personal income tax rate and corporate tax rate are 1.22 and \u22120.77, respectively. Column 2 shows that results are similar if we use a linear probability model.",

To check this possibility, in Table 5, we explore the relationship between taxes and corporate patent transfers. Because capital gains and income tax rates should not affect corporate transfers, the analysis has the natural interpretation of a placebo test. Moreover, a simple extension of our model to corporate trades suggests that corporate income taxes should be negatively associated with the transfer of patents. 31 Ideally, to estimate the effect of taxes on corporate transfers, we would like to use the effective marginal tax rate relevant to the company decision making. This is very difficult to measure, because in practice this rate depends on statutory rates, firm income, and dynamic features of the tax code such as the effects of net operating losses and projections of future income. To proxy this tax rate, we exploit a measure developed by Graham (1996)-essentially it is a simulated marginal tax rate that approximates the \"true\" tax variable managers use in their decisions (Graham provides a detailed description). These tax rates, which vary across companies and time, have been computed by Graham for essentially all firms listed on Compustat. 32 We obtained this simulated marginal tax rate for the period 1980-2010 and matched it with the sample of large corporate innovators described in Serrano (2010). The final sample contains 150,511 corporate patents. Table 5 reports OLS regressions of corporate transfers against tax rates in this sample. Because all the patents in the sample are owned by Compustat firms, we were able to include additional, time-varying controls for employees, cash flow, assets, and portfolio size. We include firm fixed effects and cluster the standard errors at the firm level. The first column shows a strong negative correlation between the new corporate tax variable and trade. In columns 2-4, we add controls for individual income and capital gains taxes. The coefficient of income and capital gains taxes are statistically insignificant and have the opposite sign from the coefficients obtained for individuals in the OLS regression (2) of Table 4. For the estimates in column 2, the elasticities are substantially different from those for individuals. The elasticity of the probability of trade with respect to the capital gains tax rate is \u22121.6 and is statistically significant for individually owned patents (p < 0.001) but is only 0.19 and statistically insignificant for corporate patents (p = .94). The large differences in statistical significance, magnitude, and sign of the two elasticities confirm that the strong relationship between capital gains taxes and patent trade that we uncovered for individual inventors is not present in company-owned patents. 33 In column 3, we show that results are robust to controlling for citations received. In column 4, we show that results are qualitatively similar when we control for income and capital gains taxes in the state of the company headquarters, rather than the state of the inventor.",

The coefficient on capital gains taxes is now much smaller and statistically insignificant (p = .99). The coefficient on the capital gains tax rate for trade of individually owned patents, estimated in column 2, implies an elasticity of \u22120.6 (standard error = .1), whereas the estimate for corporate-owned patents in column 3 corresponds to an elasticity of \u22120.01 (standard error = .28). A formal test rejects the null hypothesis that the two elasticities are the same (p = 0.04). In column 4, we present the placebo test for the subset of large patenting firms for which we have the more precise measure of corporate tax rates described in Graham (1996). The estimated coefficient on the capital gains tax rate remains statistically insignificant, as does the coefficient on the personal income tax rate, consistent with the falsification test (moreover, their point estimates have the opposite sign from those obtained for the analysis of individual inventors). The estimated coefficient on the corporate tax rate using this preferred measure is negative, as one expects, and significant at the 10% level. 34 32 Graham conducts a variety of validation exercises that show the simulated tax variables outperform alternative tax measures. For example, Graham and Mills (2008) show that these tax rates do a better job in explaining financial statement debt ratios than alternative tax measures. 33 We also ran a similar probit regression using the entire sample of patents that are assigned to U.S. corporations by the time they are granted and measuring the corporate tax rate faced by the firm owning the patent, using the sum of the federal and state top marginal rates for corporations in the state of the inventor. In this sample, we estimate an elasticity of the probability of trade with respect to the capital gains tax rate equal to \u22120.2 for corporate patents, which is substantially different from the one estimated for individual patents. 34 In unreported fixed effects regressions, we also examined whether variation in corporate tax rates is associated with variation in litigation of corporate-owned patents.

            "text": "Overall, this evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that capital gains, ordinary income, and corporate tax rates affect the likelihood that individual patent rights are traded. Because market-based reallocations presumably increase the surplus generated by the patented innovations, the fact that taxes affect transactions in intangible assets is of independent interest, quite apart from the usefulness of capital gains taxes as an instrument for identifying the impact of such trade on litigation. Our finding adds to the recent literature that documents the impact of capital gains taxation on the frequency and timing of small business transfers involving tangible assets (Chari, Golosov, and Tsyvinski, 2005;Gentry, 2010). Table 4 allow us to compute the probability that a patent is traded at a specific age, p it . The estimate of p it can be used to construct an estimate of the probability that NewOwner it = 1, which we denote by P it . To estimate the causal effect of trade on litigation, we use P it as an instrument for the endogenous variable, NewOwner it . Econometrically, the exogenous variation is derived from the capital gains tax rates, but any monotonic function of this variable can be used as an instrument and P it is a typical choice when the endogenous variable is binary (Doyle, 2007;Lileeva and Trefler, 2010). In all the first-stage regressions (reported in Table A2), P it is strongly correlated with the indicator variable N ewOwner, and the F test of joint exclusion of the instruments does not indicate problems of weak instruments (p < 0.01). Table 7 presents the parameter estimates using this IV strategy. Column 1 reports estimates when N ewOwner is instrumented by the P it , constructed from the probit regression in column 1 of Table 4. Columns 2 and 3 show that the estimated coefficient is nearly identical if the instrument is obtained from the linear probability model or the proportional hazard model. In all regressions, the estimated causal effect of a change in ownership on litigation is negative and significant, and the point estimate (in absolute value) is about six times larger than the simple OLS estimate in column 3 of Table 3. This result highlights the importance of controlling for the endogeneity of trade, and indicates a strong positive correlation between N ewOwner and the disturbance in the of corporate patents and (statutory) capital gains tax rates in a regression, both in the entire sample of corporate patents and in the sample of large corporate innovators for which we have the firm-specific data on marginal corporate tax rates.",

In this case too, the estimated coefficient on the change in ownership variable is negative and significant, and much larger in absolute value than the OLS estimates in Table 3. 35 For the full sample, the IV estimate indicates that a change in ownership reduces the annual litigation probability by about 1.2 percentage points. In the subsample of traded and litigated patents, the causal effect is an order of magnitude larger, corresponding to a reduction in litigation probability by about 16 percentage points. Whereas the difference in the magnitude of the marginal effect across the two samples is very large, the implied elasticities are fairly similar (i.e., the differences in marginal effects are driven by differences in the mean litigation probability). Evaluated at sample means, the implied elasticity is \u22120.43 (standard deviation = .10) in the full sample, and \u22120.91 (standard deviation = .39) in the restricted sample. 36 The econometric model in equation 9assumes a constant effect of trade on litigation. It is tempting to interpret these 2SLS estimates as weighted averages of heterogeneous responses. However, Angrist and Imbens (1995) show that estimates from constant effect models may differ substantially from average heterogeneous effects when there are continuous instruments and covariates. To address this concern, we follow the procedure they suggest and convert the instrument into a dummy variable. Specifically, we generate the indicator variable Large Tax Difference it = 1 if the difference between capital gains and income tax rates is above the 75th percentile of our data set (19 percentage points). We exploit this binary instrument to estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE): the average effect of a change of ownership for those patents whose owners were induced to sell their patents by the substantial difference between capital gains and income tax rates (Imbens and Angrist, 1994). The average treatment effect is \"local\" because not all patent owners are induced by the instrument to sell the patent.",

Thus, it is difficult to map the coefficients estimated in Table 4 to reductions in litigation rates for the average patent in our sample. A plausible assumption is to consider those sample patents that are litigated but not traded as \"at risk\" of being affected by a change in taxation. For these patents, the estimated LATE from column 4 implies a reduction in the annual litigation rate of about 32%. 38 Finally, there is the concern that individual inventor mobility may affect our IV estimates. The first reason is a measurement issue. We measure the capital gains tax rate based on the state of residence of the inventor. If inventors move before trading (even if the decision to move is unrelated to the decision to trade), we will get random measurement error in the capital gains tax rate-we should use the new state of residence but we use the original one. This would lead to attenuation bias in the coefficient of the capital gains tax rate in the regression of trade on tax rates. If inventors move to lower capital gains tax states with the intention of trading, this will reinforce the attenuation bias, as we do not measure the lower tax rates (in the new state) that are relevant. However, although it affects the coefficients in the trade equation, there is no reason to think that inventor mobility would affect the consistency of our IV estimates. All that matters for consistency is the orthogonality condition that the disturbance in the litigation equation is uncorrelated with the relevant capital gains tax rate. If inventors move to pay less capital gains taxes on the profits from the sale of the patent, this is unlikely to affect the new owners incentives to litigate. 39",

The vertical axis shows the effect of trade on litigation for different values of P (dashed lines are 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals). The support for P goes up to 0.15, which corresponds to the 99th percentile for the measure. The absolute value of the estimated marginal treatment effect is monotonically increasing in P. Patents with low value of P are those that, given their observables, are unlikely to have changed ownership (e.g., patents that are not highly cited or with low generality index). The small (or insignificant) values of the MTE in this range show that, if a change in capital gains taxes induced the owner of one of these patents to sell, the change in litigation risk would be negligible. Conversely, patents with high P are those at high risk of being traded. For these patents the MTE is negative, indicating a substantial drop in the likelihood of litigation from transfer of ownership. The MTE becomes statistically significant for values of P above 0.03 that roughly correspond to the median of the P distribution. 43 Figure A1 reports the nonparametric estimates of the MTE for the subsample of patents that are traded and litigated. The support for P differs from the one in the previous figure, because the estimated probability of a change in ownership is greater in the sample where all patents are 42 For the large sample, only the semiparametric MTE could be estimated, because running local linear regressions in a panel with more than two million observations is infeasible with the available computer hardware.",

Lanjouw and Schankerman (2004) show that firms with large patent portfolios are less likely to file a suit on any individual patent in their portfolios, controlling for patent characteristics, and argue that this reflects their ability to resolve disputes \"cooperatively,\" without resorting to the courts. In addition, larger firms often use broad cross-licensing agreements to avoid costly litigation and preserve freedom to operate in their R&D activities (Galasso, 2012).

To do this, we use the 36 technology subcategories defined in Hall et al. (2001). The TechFit measure is equal to one for 140 patents (about 25% of the sample).

In sharp contrast, column 2 shows that the largest reduction in litigation rates occurs when patents are traded to large entities with low fit in the buyer patent portfolio, where enforcement gains are large and product market gains are small. Columns 3 and 4 show that trade is associated with a reduction in litigation of smaller magnitude for transactions where both sources of gains (or none) are present. In column 5, we confirm the results using the pooled sample and interacting the traded indicator with the dummies for large portfolio and patent fit. 44 These results are consistent with the idea that the market for patents generates efficiency gains by reallocating patents to large patentees that have an advantage in avoiding patent disputes and/or litigation arising out of disputes. We can illustrate this mechanism with a concrete example from our sample. Our data indicate that five individually owned patents were reassigned to Sandisk Corporation in 1995. SEC annual report filings show that, during the period 1989-1999, Sandisk signed cross-licensing deals with Intel, Sharp, Hitachi, Samsung, Silicon Storage Technology, and Toshiba. This means that, for the five acquired patents, the risk of litigation with these companies disappeared once they were reassigned to Sandisk. For a more recent example, on July 6, 2012, Facebook announced a patent portfolio cross-licensing arrangement with Yahoo. Before entering the deal, Facebook acquired a number of patents from AOL, Microsoft, and IBM. Because of the cross-licensing deal, all these patents will face no litigation risk with Yahoo. More importantly, the widely discussed start-up acquisition strategy followed by Facebook (Cenicola, 2012) implies that patents initially owned by small innovators will not be involved in suits with Yahoo once they are assigned to Facebook.",

There are two reasons why we do not think this case is important in our analysis. First, it is rare in our sample that trade occurs as the settlement of disputes. To identify these events, we compared the names of the parties trading a patent with those involved in the litigation. There is very little overlap: in only 20 patent cases (3.5% of the sample of litigated and traded patents) does a patent transfer follow a suit filed by the same parties. This fact suggests that the main effect of trade on litigation operates through comparative advantage in enforcement, and not through facilitating settlement of an existing dispute. Second, the cases in which trade occurs as the outcome of a settlement are not associated with a larger impact of trade on litigation, as one would expect if avoiding litigation with the buyer is the main reason for trade. To check this, we reestimated the unbundling regression introducing an interaction for trades occurring as settlement (i.e., where the names of the parties in the trade and litigation are the same).

To address this important concern, we employed the matching procedure described in Thoma et al. (2010) in order to standardize the names of patent buyers and those of USPTO assignees and to match the two data sets. 45 The matching is performed by constructing a matching score (the Jaccard weighted distance) based on the division of name strings into sequences of characters (\"tokens\"). Specifically, the score measure is given by the ratio between the weighted sum of common tokens in the two names and the weighted sum of tokens in the two names. Each token has a weight that is inversely related to its frequency in the data set. The algorithm classifies patent buyers as \"unmatched\" if there is no USPTO assignee name that can be matched to the buyer name with a score above 0.3. If there is at least one assignee with a score above 0.3, the software matches the buyer with the assignee having the highest matching score. Additional details about the procedure can be found in Thoma et al. (2010). Exploiting the algorithm, we were able to identify an assignee number for 8,123 of the 13,607 traded patents in our sample (about 59%). 46 45 In Thoma et al. (2010), name standardization is carried out by developing a dictionary of cleaned names in the two data sets. For example, the software removes common company words (such as INC or AB) and replaces spelling variations with their harmonized equivalent (such as INTL for INTERNATIONAL and its variants).",

Of the 569 traded and litigated patents used in the heterogeneous effects analysis, the software identified a buyer for 368 patents (about 65% of the sample). For 124 of these patents the match had a score equal to 1, and for about half of the matched patents the score was above 0.8. Roughly 10% of the matched patents had a score below 0.4. In unreported regressions, we find that in the small sample we obtain qualitatively similar results if we replace the manually matched buyers with those matched by the algorithm. We also compare the performance of the regression using the matching algorithm with one in which we randomly select a fictitious buyer. The matching algorithm is informative in the sense that it performs substantially better than a random matching procedure.",

To explore this idea further, we look at the types of transactions at each level of P. Controlling for patent age, our data show that, as P increases, there is a decline in the number of trades to small buyers with high TechFit, and a corresponding increase in the low TechFit trades. For example, for patent age 5, about 30% of patents in the first quartile of the P distribution are involved in small-buyer/high-fit transactions. The fraction drops to 16% for patents in the fourth quartile of the P distribution.

Business press, legal studies, and anecdotal evidence suggest that trolls tend to be common in a few industries, specifically those with complex technologies involving many patented inputs: computers, communication, and electronics. We check whether these industries are overrepresented in the high-fit/small-buyer subsample by testing whether there are differences between the technology field composition of these patents and the composition of the other traded and litigated patents. Mean comparison tests provide no evidence of industry specialization in the high-fit/small-buyer subsample. This result is confirmed by a multinomial logit regression relating the four categories of patent transactions to technology field dummies. 47 Second, we examine whether the increase in litigation observed in the small-buyer/high-fit subsample is driven by serial buyers. From the USPTO reassignment data, we retrieve the number of patents acquired by each buyer in this group of trades during the sample period. The distribution is highly skewed (the median and mean numbers of acquired patents are 2 and 9, respectively). We generate a dummy variable capturing serial buyers (the top decile of the sample). OLS and two-stage least squares regressions where the serial buyer dummy is interacted with NewOwner show no evidence that the increase in litigation is driven by serial buyers. 48 Finally, we examine whether the increase in litigation is driven by a few serial litigants. To do this, we compute the number of patent cases in which each buyer is involved as plaintiff during the sample period. Of the 116 buyers, 76 are involved in no patent cases, and only 5 buyers are involved in more than three cases. OLS and two-stage least squares regressions that interact the number of cases with NewOwner show no evidence that the increase in litigation is driven by serial litigants.",

However, we emphasize that this finding does not rule out the possibility that trolls are important in the patent marketplace. The reason is that our data include only patents owned by individual inventors and cover the period 1983-2000. It may be that patent assertion entities are more active in the market for company-owned patents. Moreover, although there is documentary evidence of patent trolls throughout the 20th century (Resis, 2006), their activity may have intensified in the post-2000 period, in which patent activity has been growing rapidly. 49 We plan to investigate these issues in future research.",

In the second, low-tax scenario, we set \u03c4 G = 20, which is the lowest rate in our sample and is the combined rate faced in Florida in 1985. In the third, high-tax scenario, \u03c4 G = 40, which is close to the highest rate in our sample, which prevailed in California in 1997. In the last two scenarios, we study the impact of removing the differential tax treatment of capital gains. First, we increase the capital gains rate to be equal to the (personal) income tax rate. Second, we equate the two rates at the lower, capital gains rate. In all these exercises, corporate tax rates are kept at their sample mean. Table 10 summarizes the results. In the baseline scenario, E(L(\u03c4 )) is 0.013. Multiplying this number by the average number of disputes filed in each year in which the patent is litigated (1.2 in our sample) and adjusting for litigation underreporting using the weights in Lanjouw and Schankerman (2001), we can translate E(L(\u03c4 )) into a number of predicted disputes. Our computations predict about 36 disputes every 1000 patents.

Equalizing capital gains and income tax rates is associated with a contraction in the frequency of trade and an increase in litigation.

The increase in litigation rates is stronger when capital gains rates are increased to the average level of income rates in our sample (42.6%).

Such patent transactions generate both private benefits and social welfare through lower commercialization costs (Teece, 1986;Arora, et al., 2001). In addition, these transactions promote the emergence of efficient market structures in dynamic, high-technology sectors. In particular, they facilitate a more efficient division of labor in innovation activity between small firms (or individuals) that specialize in early-stage innovation and large firms whose comparative advantage lies in the later development and commercialization of these inventions (Gans and Stern, 2000;Gans et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Third, the two channels above-which relate to ex post commercialization and enforcement of innovations-also increase the ex ante incentives for R&D investment, especially for individuals and small firms, as long as the gains from trade are shared by the inventors. Given that innovation is the main engine of economic growth, and the consensus among economists, beginning with Arrow (1962), that the positive externalities from R&D imply underinvestment relative to the socially optimal level, we expect this indirect increase in ex ante incentives for R&D to enhance social welfare. 50 Despite these social benefits, patent transactions may also generate social costs. The modern patent landscape is characterized by a large number of patents, with fuzzy boundaries and fragmented ownership (Bessen and Meurer, 2008). A number of scholars have argued that this environment enables patent holders to obtain excessive royalties by holding up infringers after they have already invested heavily to design, manufacture, market, and sell the product with the allegedly infringing feature (Shapiro, 2001). Such ex post holdup may impose an \"innovation tax,\" which reduces the ex post profits of innovators who use the patent by more than would have been the case if the parties would have contracted ex ante before the sunk investment was made. This implies that ex post holdup leads to greater dilution of the ex ante incentives of the patent user to undertake capital investments and R&D in the first place. Of course, this argument is not as clear-cut as it is sometimes presented because patent trolls increase the returns to the patents that they acquire which, if shared by the original inventor in the patent transaction, also enhances the R&D incentives of those inventors. 51 Finally, patent transactions can reduce consumer welfare if patent accumulation, or concentration of patent ownership, leads to an increase in market power.",

We also show that patents are more likely to be traded when the estimated private enforcement gains from doing so are larger. From a welfare perspective, our findings imply that the market for innovation reduces litigation by reallocating patents to entities that are more effective at resolving disputes over these rights without resorting to the courts, and this represents a source of both private benefits and social welfare gains. In short, our analysis characterizes and quantifies the enforcement gains from trade from the market for patents, measured in terms of reduction in litigation risk. This is an important part of the benefit side of the welfare assessment, but it does not encompass the potential cost of a more fluid market for patent transactions.",

Although we found that, during our sample period, trolls do not play a substantial role in the market for individually owned patents, we stress that a verdict on the extent and impact of trolls is premature. Our data only cover patents owned by individual inventors and their trade history during the period 1983-2000. It is possible that trolls are more active in the market for company-owned patents, and that their activity may have intensified in the post-2000 period. If this turns out to be the case, the results in our article are still important, because they show that the market for patent rights generates real and substantial private, and social, benefits. In doing so, these results show the importance of designing remedial policies that directly target nonpracticing entities and holdup behavior (such as those recommended by Lemley and Shapiro, 2007), rather than adopting policies that broadly restrict the level of patent transactions.",

We identify a new source of gains from trade, comparative advantage in patent enforcement, and show that this mechanism reduces patent litigation. Using data on trade and litigation of individually owned patents, and exploiting variation in capital gains tax rates across states and over time as an instrumental variable, we identify the causal effect of changes in patent ownership on litigation rates.",

Second, the reallocation of these patent rights reduces litigation risk for individually owned patents, on average, indicating that enforcement gains are more important than product market gains for such patents. Third, the marginal treatment effect of trade on litigation is heterogeneous. Patents with larger potential gains from trading are those with the highest estimated probability of changing ownership. Moreover, the impact of trade is related to transaction characteristics-specifically, the size of the buyer's patent portfolio and the technological fit of the patent in that portfolio. Finally, we find no evidence that patent trolls play a significant role in our sample, but whether this conclusion also holds for corporate patent transactions, or the last decade, remains an open question.",

Tax Change is equal to the average tax change in percentage points (or growth rates) among all the changes in the capital gains tax rate in a state.
