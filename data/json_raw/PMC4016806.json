            "text": "The functional attributes of any cell are mainly regulated by cytoskeletal integrity and signaling, with actins playing a role as one of the major cytoskeletal structural proteins of eukaryotic cells. Actins are involved in many cellular processes, including cell adhesion, cell migration/movement, cytokinesis, endo-/exocytosis, cell division, signal transduction, mRNA localization, and transcription. Eukaryotes have six actin isoforms; each is encoded by an individual gene [1]. Among the six actin isoforms, two are striated muscleassociated (\u03b1-skeletal and \u03b1-cardiac muscle actins), two smooth muscle-associated (\u03b1-and \u03b3-smooth muscle actins), and two are cytoplasmic (\u03b2-and \u03b3-actins) [2]. The muscle actins are tissue-specific and constitute the contractile units, whereas \u03b2-and \u03b3-actins are ubiquitous, and are essential for cell survival [3]. The actin isoforms have highly conserved amino acid sequences. They differ mainly at their N-termini, whereas the cytoplasmic \u03b2-and \u03b3-actins differ by only four amino acids. The absence of \u03b2-actin at the embryonic stage was lethal in a transgenic mouse model [4]. \u03b2-actin exists as a globular (G-actin) or filamentous actin (F-actin); the latter is arranged in the form of strings of uniformly oriented G-actin subunits in a tight helix. The normal expression levels of \u03b2-actin mRNA are important for these cellular processes. The expression of the actin gene (ACTB, OMIM 102630) is regulated at the transcriptional [5] and post-transcriptional levels, each at the cellular localization of their mRNAs [6]. The embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) family of proteins, in particular the HuC (mouse) and human antigen R (HuR), have been shown to exhibit poly(A)-binding activity, and simultaneously bind to the AU-rich elements (ARE) and the poly(A) tail in vitro [7,8]. The mRNA of HuR is ubiquitously expressed in all proliferating cells, and is the most important post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression [9]. Dormoy-Raclet et al. have shown that HuR depletion in HeLa cells alters the cytoskeleton functions influencing cell adhesion, migration, and invasion [10]; all are attributable to the loss of \u03b2-actin stress fibers. HuR binding to the U-rich element is involved in \u03b2-actin mRNA stability, and the binding stabilizes the half-life of \u03b2-actin mRNA [5,11]."

            "text": "Our previous studies on keratoconus stroma showed that \u03b2-actin and HuR expression levels were downregulated at the mRNA and protein expression levels compared to normal stroma. This raised the possibility that downregulation of HuR and \u03b2-actin could be a result of the interplay between the two [12]. In the present study, we used siRNA-mediated gene knockdown to determine if HuR gene silencing affects the stability of \u03b2-actin mRNA. The decreased HuR expression resulted in decreased \u03b2-actin gene and protein expression leading to decreased fibroblast wound healing and their proliferation.",

In the present study, we used RNAi-mediated gene silencing for \u03b2-actin or HuR in normal corneal fibroblasts to understand the respective gene functions. The GAPDH gene and scrambled sequence (which do not affect any targeted genes) were used as positive and negative controls for transfection, respectively. The sequences of the siRNA duplex were selected from the coding region of the desired target mRNAs, and the transfection was performed as described in the Methods section. The desired mRNA levels were analyzed using RT-PCR at 24 h post-transfection. Figure 1A(I) shows \u03b2-actin gene expression using \u03b2-actin primers after transfection of human corneal fibroblasts with the scrambled siRNA, siGAPDH, si\u03b2-actin, or siHuR. Expression of the \u03b2-actin gene was downregulated after the HuR gene was silenced, which suggested that HuR has a regulatory role in \u03b2-actin gene expression. Additionally, \u03b2-actin gene silencing also showed downregulation of the \u03b2-actin gene, which was used as the control. Figure  1A(II) shows HuR gene expression using HuR primers after transfection of human corneal fibroblasts with siRNA for scrambled, GAPDH, \u03b2-actin, or HuR. Expression of the HuR gene was downregulated on HuR gene silencing, whereas \u03b2-actin gene silencing had no effect on HuR expression. Figure 1B shows western blot analysis of \u03b2-actin expression after transfection with the siRNA of scrambled, GAPDH, \u03b2-actin, and HuR. The western blot results show the reduced expression of \u03b2-actin and HuR relative to vimentin (used as the control). For visualization of vimentin with anti-vimentin antibody, the blot that was used for \u03b2-actin visualization was stripped and used again for the vimentin visualization. RT-PCR analysis showed that after 24 h, GAPDH gene silencing had no effect, and the expression remained at the same level (data not shown), which was confirmed with the western blot analysis. Figure 1C shows the percentage of \u03b2-actin expression levels after they normalized to vimentin and calculated as described in the Methods section. Relative to the expression of vimentin, the levels of \u03b2-actin expression were 24% and 18% lower after HuR and \u03b2-actin gene silencing, respectively. This suggests that the loss of HuR results in downregulation of the \u03b2-actin gene. There was no change in the \u03b2-actin expression levels after the GAPDH gene or negative control (siCTR) was silenced. Figure 1D shows the real-time PCR analysis after 72 h of siRNA treatments for the siCTR, GAPDH, HuR, and \u03b2-actin genes. The y-axis in the figure shows the relative fold expression, and the x-axis shows the \u03b2-actin primer used for the real-time PCR analysis. \u03b2-actin gene expression decreased by 80-90% after the \u03b2-actin and HuR genes were silenced, which was similar to the RT-PCR analysis. Whereas GAPDH gene silencing suppressed \u03b2-actin gene expression after 72 h of gene silencing ( Figure 1D).",

Together, the results showed that \u03b2-actin expression affected GAPDH gene silencing ( Figures 3F,G), whereas it remained unaffected with the use of scrambled siRNA. We analyzed the effect of HuR gene silencing on \u03b2-actin gene expression ( Figure 3I-K), which showed an absence of green fluorescence (due to \u03b2-actin, Figure 3J) and decreased red fluorescence (staining F-actin; Figure 3K). \u03b2-actin gene knockdown was used as a positive control to examine the effects of gene silencing. Similarly, \u03b2-actin gene knockdown ( Figure 3M-P) resulted in an absence of green fluorescence (due to \u03b2-actin, Figure 3N) and decreased red fluorescence of F-actin (staining F-actin, Figure 3O). Together, the results suggested that the silencing of HuR or \u03b2-actin gene ( Figure 3J,N) resulted in downregulation of the \u03b2-actin gene, as observed earlier during western blot analysis ( Figure 1B). Further, the HuR gene seems to be a stability factor for \u03b2-actin mRNA, and plays a role in gene expression. In contrast, the \u03b2-actin gene had no effect on HuR gene expression. However, the downregulation of the \u03b2-actin gene after gene silencing of GAPDH ( Figure 3F) was a surprise to us, and has been shown for the first time.",

Together, the results show that scrambled siRNA treatment had no effect on cell migration, which was identical to that of normal cell migration ( Figure 4A,B).

Silencing the HuR gene significantly decreased cell migration, whereas \u03b2-actin gene silencing abolished the migration.

A scratch wound was created at 72 h after transfection, and the dotted line in Figure 5 shows the wounded area. The images were taken at 0 h and 24 h post-scratch using a phase contrast microscope with a Nikon camera ( Figure 5). The cells that migrated to the region between the dotted lines (wound) were counted from multiple images and the standard deviation determined ( Figure 5K). Figure 5A,B shows the extent of the migration of the corneal fibroblasts at 0 h and 24 h postscratch, respectively.

The untreated normal corneal fibroblast layer had almost 100% wound closure in the region between the dotted lines ( Figure 5B) with similar results observed with scrambled siRNA ( Figure 5D). GAPDH siRNA treatment showed cell migration decreased after 24 h ( Figure 5F), but greater decreased migration was seen in the cells treated with HuR siRNA ( Figure 5H) or with \u03b2-actin siRNA ( Figure  5J). Together, the results showed that the wound healing process was decreased after GAPDH gene silencing but a relatively greater decrease occurred with HuR and \u03b2-actin gene silencing. Figure 5K summarizes cell migration at 24 h after wound healing subjected to different siRNA treatments. Similarly, GAPDH siRNA treatment also resulted in decreased cell migration, GAPDH, an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway shown to have multiple functions, including an effect on cell motility during wound healing [16].",

We performed a wound healing assay with Ly292004, a PI3K inhibitor, to examine how the inhibition of PI3K affects fibroblasts migration ( Figure 6). Figure  6A,B,D,E,G,H shows cell migration at 0 h and 24 h postscratch following treatment with scrambled siRNA, \u03b2-actin  siRNA, or HuR siRNA, respectively. Similarly, Figure 6C,F,I shows the results of PI3K inhibition using LY292004 after 24 h. After 24 h post-scratch, the untreated cells migrated to the wound ( Figure 6B) where on PI3K inhibition, severely impaired wound healing occurred ( Figure 6C). \u03b2-Actin and HuR gene silencing resulted in inhibition of wound healing after 24 h post-scratch as seen in Figure 6E,H, respectively. The inhibition of PI3K and gene silencing had the same effects as that of gene silencing alone ( Figure 6F,I). Figure  6J shows the downstream pathway of PI3K, and its inhibition would have a similar effect as that of \u03b2-actin and HuR gene silencing.",

The levels of \u03b2-actin and HuR gene expression were reduced by 72% and 64% after \u03b2-actin and HuR gene silencing, respectively. The mRNA of HuR is ubiquitously expressed in all proliferating cells, and it is the most important post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression [9]. HuR binding to the U-rich element is involved in mRNA stability [5,11], and prolongs the half-life of \u03b2-actin mRNA [10]. Together, our present study showed that silencing the HuR gene resulted in downregulation of \u03b2-actin at the transcriptional and translational levels in corneal fibroblasts. This downregulation could be due to the loss of HuR, a stability factor for \u03b2-actin mRNA. These expression levels were downregulated for up to 96 h post-siRNA treatment (results not shown).",

When the HuR gene was silenced, its expression was decreased, but its expression was not affected after the GAPDH gene, the \u03b2-actin gene, or scrambled siRNA (data not shown) was silenced. Gene silencing of either the HuR-or \u03b2-actin gene resulted in decreased expression of the \u03b2-actin gene. Therefore, the HuR gene has a regulatory role in \u03b2-actin expression, which was confirmed at translational levels with confocal imaging. Surprisingly, \u03b2-actin gene expression was also decreased after the GAPDH gene was silenced ( Figure 3F). This could be due to diverse functions of GAPDH, such as DNA repair [19], tRNA export [20], and in cell death [21,22]. GAPDH is also known to interact with tubulin and actin and thus plays a role in cytoskeleton dynamics [23].",

Gama-actin expression was not affected when the \u03b2-actin gene was silenced in normal corneal fibroblasts (data not shown). Cell culture studies have shown that \u03b2-and \u03b3-actins have distinct physiologic roles. In the motile cells, \u03b2-actin accumulates at the leading edge, and \u03b3-actin tends to be at the stress fibers [24]. Complementing this was the finding that the \u03b2-actin mRNA was located at the leading edge of the moving fibroblast whereas \u03b3-actin was localized at the stress fibers [25]. Recent studies using knockout mouse models have also shown that \u03b2-actin and \u03b3-actins show distinct phenotypes. This is further supported by the fact that in a \u03b2-actin knockout mouse, the embryonic fibroblasts showed a decreased G-actin pool compared to F-actin [15]. Our results also showed positive F-actin staining in fibroblasts that showed the absence of \u03b2-actin staining in normal fibroblasts following \u03b2-actin gene silencing. The presence of F-actin staining could be due to the presence of \u03b3-actin in these cells. This could also be due to the absence of the monomeric G-actin pool, which could lead to increased expression of megakaryoblastic leukemia (MAL also known as MKL) gene ID 89880, OMIM 60607; serum response factor (SRF) gene ID 6722 , OMIM 600589 (MAL-SRF) target genes.

Overexpression of the \u03b2-actin gene results in plasma membrane protrusions and cell migration [28]. Our cell motility analysis using Boyden chambers showed that gene silencing of \u03b2-actin drastically reduced the cell migration ( Figure 4E). Cell migration was also decreased when HuR was downregulated ( Figure 4D) but was unaffected in untreated cells or those treated with scrambled siRNA. Cell motility is an important feature of multicellular organisms, maintained by actin-based protrusions such as lamellipodia, ruffles, and filopodia [29]. We observed for the first time that GAPDH gene silencing also affected cell migration, possibly by way of its known function as an actinbinding protein. It has been recently reported that glycolytic enzymes, which included GAPDH, are associated with actin and other membrane proteins [30]. This association might satisfy the high ATP energy demand during actin dynamics.",

This leads to a series of events that causes the keratocyte transformation to fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, and irregular spacing of collagen fibrils [32]. Silencing of the \u03b2-actin and HuR genes resulted in a significant decrease in wound healing as evidenced by the decrease in the cell migration in a scratch-wound gap in a confluent cell layer ( Figure 5H,J). In contrast, complete wound healing occurred in normal corneal fibroblasts, and those treated with scrambled siRNA, whereas GAPDH siRNA also showed decreased cell migration. Together, the results suggest the importance of \u03b2-actin and HuR in cell motility during wound healing. The unexpected role of GAPDH in cell migration and proliferation requires further study.",

Small G-protein, Rac1, which is an effector of PI3K, mediates stress-activated kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and is essential for basic fibroblastic growth factor ( bFGF)-induced fibroblast migration [33]. A specific inhibitor of PI3K, LY292004, causes significant inhibition of cell growth and migration. Our results also show inhibition of PI3K by LY292004 significantly inhibited cell growth and migration in siCTR cells ( Figure 6J). This was similar to cells that had undergone \u03b2-actin or HuR gene silencing. The absence of \u03b2-actin monomers (an effect of \u03b2-actin gene knockdown) hinders actin cytoskeleton polymerization and thus affects cell migration and proliferation. This result was similar to that of inhibition of PI3K ( Figure 6J) and an upstream element in the pathway ( Figure 6J).",
