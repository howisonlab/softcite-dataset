It remains unknown whether index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) reflects the functional outcome in patients with anterior myocardial infarction (AMI) with or without microvascular obstruction (MO).This study was performed to evaluate the clinical value of the IMR for assessing myocardial injury and predicting microvascular functional recovery in patients with AMI undergoing primary PCI. We enrolled 34 patients with first anterior AMI. After successful primary PCI, the mean distal coronary artery pressure (Pa), coronary wedge pressure (Pcw), mean aortic pressure (Pa), mean transit time (Tmn), and IMR (Pd * hyperemic Tmn) were measured. The presence and extent of MO were measured using cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI). All patients underwent follow-up echocardiography after 6 months. We divided the patients into two groups according to the existence of MO (present; n = 16, absent; n = 18) on MRI.",

            "text": "Early restoration of epicardial coronary blood flow reduces infarct size in patients with acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) and has a beneficial effect on healing of the myocardium and left ventricular (LV) remodeling. However, successful restoration of epicardial flow does not induce optimal reperfusion of myocardial tissue and microvascular function, LV remodeling, and improved clinical outcome (1). As a consequence, complete restoration of infarct-related arterial patency and microvascular integrity has important prognostic significance in patients after an AMI (2). Microvascular obstruction (MO), or no reflow phenomenon, defines an area within an AMI that has undergone cardiomyocyte necrosis, as well as severe and irreversible microcirculation damage (3). Microvascular obstruction is associated with poor prognosis and worse LV remodeling. Infarct extent and MO can reliably be detected by magnetic resonance imag-ing (MRI) (4). However, this information is not readily available in clinical practice, and other prognostic measures have been proposed to meet such limitations. The thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade, the TIMI blush grade, the corrected TIMI frame count, and the coronary flow reserve (CFR) have all been investigated and known to be related to outcome of AMI patients (5,6). With recent technological advances, it is now possible to measure pressure and estimate coronary artery flow simultaneously with a single pressure-temperature sensortipped coronary wire (7,8). The single pressure-temperature sensor-tipped coronary wire has additional advantage of allowing assessment of several potentially useful clinical indices. It has been reported that IMR was a predictor of microvascular damage after myocardial infarction and predictor of left ventricular functional recovery after 3 months (9, 10). However, our study periods are 6 months, thereby more reliable results can be derived from our study. Out study can be more reliable for 6 months pehttp://dx.doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2012.27.9.1044 riod of study more than 3 months. It also has been reported that IMR was a predictor of myocardial viability and left ventricular functional recovery in acute myocardial infarction (11). Past study used 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to quantify the myocardial variability, and few IMR study using MRI has been done (12). We quantified myocardial viability by MRI and it has relatively free methods-limitation. Studies with animal models have shown that an index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) correlates with true microvascular resistance, and unlike CFR, it is independent of the epicardial arteries (7,8,12,13). Therefore, a relationship between the perfusion and infarct size can be assumed, but whether or not the microvascular hemodynamic parameter can reliably represent the extent of necrosis in the infarct territory remains unknown. Furthermore, previous studies have not focused on the indices which specifically represent cardiac microvascular status and can thus accurately predict the extent of myocardial injury during the acute phase of an AMI. We assessed the clinical value of the IMR to assess the micro-vascular dysfunction and predicting microvascular functional recovery in patients with AMI who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).",

We assessed delayed enhancement images and infarct size as previously described (14). The total infarct size was calculated as the percentage of the LV mass, and transmural extent of infarction was calculated by dividing the hyper-enhanced area by the total area of the predefined segment (%). A transmurality score was calculated in each patient, which was expressed as the sum of segments with > 75% infarcted myocardium as a percentage of the total number of segments scored. On the delayed enhancement images, the MO was defined as any region of hypo-enhancement within the hyper-enhanced infarcted area, and was included in the calculation of the total infarct size. The extent of MO was calculated in each patient, and measured percent by dividing number of MO segment by number of total segment.

Steady state of maximal hyperemia was induced by intravenous infusion of adenosine (140 \u00b5g/kg/min). Three additional 3 mL aliquots of room temperature saline was injected, and the hyperemic mean transit time (hTmn) was measured. The simultaneous measurements of mean aortic pressure (Pa, by guiding catheter) and mean distal coronary pressure (Pd, by pressure wire) were also obtained during the resting state and maximal hyperemic state.

Thus, the elevation of the mean Pcw appears, in part, to explain an increase in Pcw/Pa in the MO patients (Table 2). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that were closely related to IMR, and the presence of MO was proven to be related to IMR (T = 3.4; P < 0.01), and no MO had the strongest relationship to IMR.

Patients who had PCI were studied by using Gd-enhanced MR to evaluate infarct size and enhancement which reflects MO. Echocardiography was performed after MI and then 6 months later. Our study showed that hemodynamic indices (IMR, Pcw, and Pcw/Pa) reflected the extent of MO and functional recovery at 6 months after MI. Recovery of function and development of remodeling after MI are strongly related to perfusion at the microcirculatory level. Recent MRI investigations have shown that MO, irrespective of infarct size, is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events after infarction (15). The no-reflow phenomenon is thus an important prognostic factor (16), but its detection requires additional investigations, such as MRI or myo-cardial contrast echocardiography. The findings of this study suggest that microcirculatory reactivity assessed with a coronary guide wire indicates the amount of microvascular injury and clarifies why coronary hemodynamic parameters can be used as a prognostic parameter for myocardial functional recovery. The CFR has been reported that the increased flow velocity during the acute phase of an AMI limits the accurate evaluation of the extent of microvascular injury (8,17). Although the role of Pcw in protecting the myocardium and in reflecting myocardial injury is fraught with controversy, a recent study reported that the rise of coronary wedge pressure reflects the level of microvascular injury, and that the coronary zero flow pressure (Pzf) in AMI patients who underwent PCI within 24 hr of the onset of chest pain is correlated with the microvascular dysfunction induced by myocardial injury (18,19). The results of our study support the findings of previous studies by demonstrating the coronary artery wedge pressure and correction of coronary artery wedge pressure to coronary perfusion pressure (Pcw/Pa) as useful indicators for ischemic microvascular dysfunction. The IMR is a novel index that represents microvascular integrity; the IMR is a better predictive parameter of myocardial damage than other parameters for evaluating the microvasculature after primary PCI (12,13). The indices of various coronary artery microvascular abnormalities were measured by intra-coronary pressure wires within the coronary arteries and then compared to MR images, the current standard method of evaluation for myocardial injury. The present study has shown that the intracoronary hemodynamic indices (Pcw and Pcw/Pa), measured by the intracoronary pressure, adequately represent myocardial injury. In the presence of detectable significant myonecrosis, we presumed that increasing IMR indicates microvascular dysfunction after PCI. The results of our study also support IMR as a useful indi- Fig. 2. Correlation between \u0394RWMSI and IMR (A) and Pcw/Pa (B). There was significant inverse correlation between \u0394RWMSI and IMR. Thus, higher IMR is associated with the lower \u0394RWMSI, implying the worse functional outcomes. Significant correlation was also found between \u0394RWMSI and Pcw/Pa. Triangles indicate patients with MO, and circles represent patients with no MO. \u0394 (delta), the difference of the values at Follow up day minus at baseline day; RWMSI, regional wall motion score index; IMR, index of microcirculatory resistance; Pcw/Pa, coronary wedge pressure to mean aortic pressure ratio. cator for assessing microvascular dysfunction after PCI during the acute phase of myocardial ischemia. As an invasive indicator, IMR is expected to play an important role in assessing microvascular injury and prognosis, and in planning treatment procedures at earlier stages of disease. Also, Pcw/Pa and CFR thermo can be obtained simultaneously by an intracoronary pressure wire, providing additional information about the degree of microvascular dysfunction and myocardial injury. Furthermore, simultaneous measurement of intracoronary pressure parameters and IMR may provide a simple means for comprehensive and specific assessment of intracoronary hemodynamics at both the epicardial and microvascular levels, respectively. MO with a subsequent high impedance results in the inability to squeeze blood forward into the venous circulation during systole, and consequently the blood will be pushed back into the epicardial coronary arteries (20). We acknowledge limitations of the study. First, the hemodynamic characteristics of coronary arteries and their clinical significance and outcome can vary according to the different infarct-related arteries and the location of the lesion. In light of such a fact, the study had excluded patients with anatomic variations and whose lesions were located at the distal portion. Secondly, there is a controversy about the effect of epicardial artery occlusion when measuring the microvascular resistance using IMR. When the occlusion is severe, the simplified equation of this study does not take collateral circulations into consideration, resulting overestimation of microvascular resistance. However, in our study, the measurements were obtained after successful removal of epicardial occlusion through intervention, thus the effect of epicardial artery occlusion is thought to be minimal. Moreover, transient vasospasm and distal microemboli during the acute phase of an MI can increase microvascular resistance, but it does not always result in irreversible necrosis of the myocardium. Third limitation is that there is no TIMI frame count, myocardial blush score, TIMI flow, and specific follow up wall motion score. Such a fact can serve as a limitation in the evaluation of myocardial dysfunction using the IMR as a measure of microvascular resistance during the acute phase of an AMI.",
