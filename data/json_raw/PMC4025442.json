Routinely collected administrative health data are available to address these issues in large population-based pharmacoepidemiological studies. By bringing together cross-jurisdictional data collections that link drug exposure to real-world outcomes, this research programme aims to evaluate the use and impact of cancer medicines in a subset of elderly Australians in the real-world clinical setting. Methods and analysis: This ongoing research programme involves a series of retrospective cohort studies of Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) clients. The study population includes 104 635 veterans who reside in New South Wales, Australia, and were aged 65 years and over as of 1 July 2004. We will investigate trends in cancer medicines use according to cancer type and other sociodemographic characteristics as well as predictors of the initiation of cancer medicines and other treatment modalities, survival and adverse outcomes among patients with cancer. The programme is underpinned by the linkage of eight health administrative databases under the custodianship of the DVA and the New South Wales Ministry of Health, including cancer notifications, medicines dispensing data, hospitalisation data and health services data. The cancer notifications database is available from 1994 with all other databases available from 2005 onwards.",

            "text": "The emergence of effective cancer medicines is acclaimed as one of the major medical advances of the 20th century. 1 For some cancers, cytotoxic chemotherapy is curative, even in the setting of metastatic disease, and the promise of long-term survival makes the risk of adverse events and financial costs worthwhile. 2 Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast, colorectal or lung cancer offers significant survival gains beyond surgery alone. For patients with incurable disease, chemotherapy can also lengthen survival. The prospects for patients with cancer have improved further by the recent development of molecular profiling of tumour cells. This technology has facilitated the identification of 'novel, druggable targets' that can be modulated to control or cure cancer. 3 Moreover, 'personalised medicine' has the potential to optimise treatment efficacy and minimise the toxicity of therapeutic agents. 3 Drug regulatory bodies and funding agencies play an important role in translating current evidence into policy and clinical practice. Data generated in clinical trials form the basis for regulatory approval because licensing organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) request that manufacturers demonstrate new medicines are safe and efficacious before approval for marketing. After market approval, governments and other third party payers have developed subsidy systems to achieve greater access to pharmaceuticals. These systems involve a delicate balance between providing access to effective treatments while ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability. 4 Worldwide, many third party payers now require that healthcare technology manufacturers provide evidence of a product's cost-effectiveness, based mostly on clinical trial evidence, to support subsidy applications.",

While clinical trials are the indisputable gold standard for demonstrating drug safety and efficacy, they have significant limitations as an evidence base for regulatory and subsidy decisions. 5 6 Some of these drawbacks include: small sample size, short duration, use of surrogate endpoints, early stopping rules that permit cross-over to experimental therapy, lack of measurement of real clinical effects, bias towards younger patients and under-representation of patients with complex health problems. 7 To add to these well-established limitations, the uncertainties for decision-makers have increased due to stakeholder demand for faster access to potentially life-saving medicines. While fast-track initiatives show commendable responsiveness to stakeholder concerns, the end result is that the premarket approval evidence base is becoming increasingly limited and medicines are reaching the marketplace earlier than ever before. Clearly, no clinical trial could ever be large enough or long enough to quantify all clinical outcomes, risks or otherwise; however, the current situation has created an urgent need to better understand how cancer medicines are prescribed in routine clinical care.",

            "text": "To demonstrate the consequences of this situation we have been undertaking a comprehensive review of all peer-reviewed literature of pharmacoepidemiological research undertaken in Australia using PBS or RPBS dispensing data over a 25-year period (1987-2012). We identified 196 studies, 110 of which were published between 2007 and 2012. Approximately one-third of all published studies (n=70) were based on aggregated claims level data reporting the volume of medicines dispensed over designated time periods. These studies provide little evidence on the way in which medicines are prescribed and used in the Australian population. Another third of all studies (n=91) examined clinician or patient behaviour around a particular medication (coprescribing, potential drug interactions, switching behaviours or patient adherence to therapy). Only 13% of studies linked individual-level medicines use to a health outcome. Moreover, there have only been six studies with a cancer medicines focus. [9][10][11][12][13][14] As such, pharmacoepidemiological research has no systematic framework for undertaking timely studies of medicines use and health outcomes in real-world settings. In direct contrast, the Nordic countries have had long-standing and robust approaches to accessing routinely collected data for pharmacoepidemiological research. In a recent publication, they showcased their pharmacoepidemiological research with an output of 515 research papers in a period of only 6 years (2005-2010). 15 There has been a notable exception in terms of advancing pharmacoepidemiological research in Australia. The Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) subsidises healthcare and pharmaceuticals for eligible veterans and their dependants, with the collected health claims data available for use in pharmacoepidemiological research. [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] Since the DVA are responsible for all aspects of hospital and community care for their clients they have both exposure and outcomes data under their custodianship. More than one-third of all studies included in our review above used RPBS data. Moreover, more than two-thirds of all studies examining individual level medicines use in our review used RPBS data. To date, the vast majority of the DVA's pharmacoepidemiological research has been conducted under the auspices of the Veterans' Medicines Advice and Therapeutics Education Services (Veterans' MATES) program. 28 However, cancer pharmacoepidemiology has not been a focus of the Veterans' MATES program.",

A 'project key' containing the PPN and encrypted client number for each respective database is sent to the various data custodians who decrypted the client number and attached the PPNs and requested content variables.

Probabilistic matching assigns a weight to pairs of records based on how likely they are to be a true match based on a comparison of name, date of birth and address. Records with high weights are considered a true match while those with low weights are false matches; uncertain matches undergo clerical review. The cut-off for determining whether a match is true or false is chosen as to minimise the number of false positives, false negatives and the number of clerical reviews. 39 The linkage algorithms take into account name reversals, name shortenings and a limited number of keystroke errors in date of birth. The CHeReL routinely performs these linkages, and standard operating procedures exist to fine tune the linkage sensitivity and specificity depending on the cohort data being linked. CHeReL follows established quality assurance processes for their master linkage key, linkage procedures and linkage staff. In general, these processes achieve false positive rates of 0-5/1000 and false negative rates of <1/1000. However, the quality of the probabilistic matching process is highly dependent on the quality of the data provided, and in the case of DVA clients, important linkage variables such as name, date of birth and death and address histories are well documented. For example, an audit of the first CCR, APDC and EDDC linkages found a false positive rate of 0.4% and a false negative rate of <0.5%. Moreover, individual research projects conducted under the auspices of this programme start with a comprehensive review of the cohort to minimise the inclusion of false positive cases. This is carried out by identifying and excluding cases where there are discrepancies between dates of birth and death across different databases or in circumstances where a client has observations of health resource use after their date of death.",

For these individuals there will be almost complete ascertainment of subsidised healthcare utilisation by combining DVA and NSW databases; it is this subpopulation that we will generally use for analysis of health services utilisation and medicines use. An additional 5% received subsidised pharmaceuticals only (Orange Card holders). Inclusion of this cohort in analyses would be appropriate to answer research questions that require pharmaceutical claims data only. Finally, 6% of DVA clients received subsidies for health services and pharmaceuticals related to the treatment of specific conditions related to service or any malignancy (White Card holders). Inclusion of this cohort would be appropriate for research questions about the medicines and health service use of clients with cancer.  Over half (52%) of Gold Card holders were women, while men were the vast majority of White and Orange Card holders (table 2). The gender disparity at different levels of entitlement reflects the fact that the majority of female DVA clients are war widows, 31 who are not eligible for White or Orange Cards. Most clients were aged between 80 and 84 years. Given the older age of this population, attrition was high with approximately 7% dying every year of follow-up. A quarter of clients (26%) had been diagnosed with cancer, with prostate, skin and colorectal cancers being the most common. White and Orange Card holders were less likely to have breast cancer given the fewer number of women with these entitlements. In a 1-year period, 54% of all DVA clients had no hospitalisations. Among those hospitalised, the comorbidity burden as measured by the Charlson index 40 was low, with most having an index of 0 (table 2). Since the collection of hospital separation data is provided by the NSW Ministry of Health, it is not dependent on DVA subsidy, so there was little variation by level of DVA healthcare entitlement. In contrast, given the limited subsidy of pharmaceutical items among White Card holders, this group was more likely to have had no dispensing records in a 1-year period. When comorbidities are defined using the RxRisk, 41 approximately one quarter of clients had seven or more comorbidities (table 2). Nearly two-thirds of clients lived in major cities (defined by the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia), 42 and nearly one-third resided in areas classified as the least disadvantaged (defined by the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage 43 ; table 2).",

Among White and Orange Card holders, 19% and 34%, respectively, were ever dispensed a statin (table 3). The lower percentage among White Card holders likely reflects their lower rate of subsidy for pharmaceuticals. Cancer medicine use, including chemotherapy and hormone therapy, represented only 0.5% of dispensing records. Over a 1-year period the most commonly dispensed antineoplastics were gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, such as goserelin, and pyrimidine analogues, such as capecitabine, reflecting the high rates of prostate and colorectal cancers (table 4).",

In Australia, we have comprehensive pharmaceutical claims data collections for prescribed medicines dispensed in community and private hospitals, but not for public hospital inpatients. Given the vast majority of oncology protocols are administered in the outpatient setting or to private hospital inpatients (both of which are captured in the R/PBS data), we believe this issue will not impact significantly on the outcomes of our analyses. However, if in the unlikely event that chemotherapy is administered to public hospital inpatients, it is indicated as a procedure code in the public hospital separation record. While we will not know the nature of the chemotherapy we can identify an episode when chemotherapy was administered in hospital, allowing us to estimate the chemotherapy use that was not identified in the R/PBS dispensing data. While there are clear limitations in terms of complete ascertainment of cancer medicines dispensing claims, our approach remains the best way of defining medicines exposure in whole of population studies. Since it is highly unlikely that we would miss every administration of a cancer medicine over the course of a chemotherapy protocol, we will almost certainly identify most patients who had received some type of cancer drug treatment.",

The accuracy of cancer incidence in DVA clients depends on the completeness and accuracy of the NSW CCR. Routine indicators of data quality and completeness show the Australian State and Territory cancer registries are operating in accordance with international standards. 50 In terms of outcomes of interest, poor sensitivity may be an issue as we commonly identify outcomes that result in hospitalisation before we can identify potential outcomes of interest and the health service records contain no diagnostic information. However, poor specificity of the outcome is worse than a lack of sensitivity in most situations. 51 If the specificity of the outcome is 100% then relative risk estimates are unbiased. A recent comprehensive study on the misclassification of claims data diagnoses using medical record chart review as the gold standard revealed the sensitivity of claims diagnoses is often less than moderate whereas specificity is usually 95% or greater. A high specificity of diagnostic coding in claims data can be expected because if a diagnosis is coded and recorded it is likely the diagnosis was made. 52 The data also lack certain important covariates, including health behaviours such as smoking, drinking habits and obesity. Further, our data set is not linked to DVA military service records. In hospital separation data, comorbidities are only recorded if they are directly related to the reason for admission. As a result, there have been several algorithms developed to identify the presence of important comorbidities using administrative claims data, including in hospitalisation data (such as the Charlson index 53 ) and in dispensing data (such as the RxRisk 54 ).",

The two-phased approach was developed after discussions with the DVA and NSW Ministry of Health data custodians. Given the novelty of the linkage, it was determined that the first linkage should be used to demonstrate the feasibility of the linkage after which time the additional data would be linked. Despite this, there was a 3-year delay between the first ethics approval and delivery of the data. The primary impediments related to a lack of capacity within the various agencies to extract the data and due to challenges in negotiating and signing a data service agreement between the DVA (a Commonwealth agency) and an academic institution.",

We minimised the risk to personal privacy by: \u25b8 A third party, the CHeReL, undertaking the record linkage, ensuring the smallest number of people have access to the identifiable data. \u25b8 Ensuring data are stored securely. \u25b8 Restricting access to identified data to officers in the CHeReL, whose access is password protected and subject to the signing of a confidentiality agreement. \u25b8 Separating the data linkage process (where access to personally identified data is necessary), from the data analysis, so that personal information and health information are separated. \u25b8 Ensuring researchers will not be in possession of any personal identifying information. The identifiable information (such as name and address) will be removed from the content data by linkage staff after record linkage has taken place. \u25b8 Ensuring the files released to researchers will not contain DVA clients' actual enrolment number, rather a unique project number generated by CHeReL staff. \u25b8 Ensuring identifiable information will not be published.",

Observational studies of the kind described in this protocol are particularly important as the elderly are under-represented in clinical trials but are the subpopulation with the highest rates of medicine use 58 and are at the most at risk of adverse events. 59 60 The DVA have a strong tradition of making data available for research purposes and this programme will establish a long-term programme in cancer pharmacoepidemiology. Moreover, there have been encouraging developments in Australia in recent years that will increase the opportunities for Australian researchers to undertake whole of population, pharmacoepidemiology research. At the national level, the Department of Human Services (custodians of Medicare and PBS data) now provides timely access to person-level medicines dispensing data. At the state level, major linked data resources incorporating hospital separations, ED visits, cancer registrations, mental health service use and fact and cause of death data have been available for nearly two decades via the Western Australian Data Linkage System (WADLS) and the NSW CHeReL since 2006. A similar service has been recently established in South Australia and the Northern Territory via SA-NT Datalink. Other states will follow in the near future due to the injection of more than $A60 million by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). Moreover, there is a strong commitment from government for linked Commonwealth and State data through Integrating Authorities, which have become operational in 2012. With these advances cancer pharmacoepidemiology research in Australia has a bright future.",
