            "text": "A worldwide epidemic of chronic disease, and complications thereof, is underway, with no sign of abatement. Healthcare costs have increased tremendously, principally because of the need to treat chronic complications of non-communicable diseases including cardiovascular disease, blindness, end-stage renal disease, and amputation of extremities. Current healthcare systems fail to provide an appropriate quality of care to prevent the development of chronic complications without additional healthcare costs. A new paradigm for prevention and treatment of chronic disease and the complications thereof is urgently required. Several clinical studies have clearly shown that frequent communication between physicians and patients, based on electronic data transmission from medical devices, greatly assists in the management of chronic disease. However, for various reasons, these advantages have not translated effectively into real clinical practice. In the present review, we describe current relevant studies, and trends in the use of information technology for chronic disease management. We also discuss limitations and future directions.",

The worldwide diabetic population is projected to increase from 366 million in 2011 to 552 million in 2030 [3]. Diabetes is already a major healthcare burden; the annual mortality is estimated to be 4.6 million [4]. In South Korea, the prevalence of diabetes among adults aged 30 years or over is about 12.4%, and the estimated number of diabetic subjects 4 million [5]. It is essential to improve medical services to ensure effective high-quality medical treatment; this obviously increases both demand and cost. Further increases in the incidence of chronic disease and accompanying complications are inevitable unless the current system is changed. The social and economic expense of change must be accepted.",

Diabetic patients are at high risk of the development of various complications and are thus in need of constant management. Diabetic complications, such as cardiovascular disease, account for the major proportion of treatment costs, which can obviously be reduced by preventing the development of complications [15]. Many reports have shown that aggressive diabetes management saves medical costs [16,17] and need not affect the quality of care. Prevention of complications, early treatment triggered by close monitoring of blood glucose levels, proactive education on diet and exercise, and regular monitoring, are all essential to manage diabetes effectively and at minimal cost. Also, detection and intensive treatment of early-stage diabetes greatly contribute to reducing the incidence and cost of long-term complications [18].",

Many patients have already expressed the desire to participate in U-healthcare [35], and an Internet-based glucose monitoring (IBGM) system has been developed.

Thus, patients in rural areas where the Internet is not accessible, or elderly patients unfamiliar with computers or the Internet, are unable to access U-healthcare. IBGM can be performed only in urban areas with readily available Internet connections. In addition, this U-healthcare is accompanied by continual direct, personal treatment, including visits to medical professionals. Therefore, patients with poor accessibility to specialized medical institutions cannot use U-healthcare. Flexibility and accessibility must be improved to support systematic diabetes management more effectively. A new system featuring personal data assistants with inbuilt blood sugar-monitoring capacities was trialled at a public health center in a farming community with limited access to medical professionals and treatment. HbA1c levels improved significantly [41], confirming that IBGM was indeed effective at managing diabetes in a rural area with only a public health clinic. This illustrates the benefits of linking medical care to a mobile device.",

In other words, it must be shown that the medical and social cost reductions achieved are greater than the expenses associated with establishment, application, and maintenance of the system. Such costs include commercialization, provision of new devices, the labor of medical teams, systems maintenance, and server management. Any measure enhancing patient care and satisfaction, while minimizing personal expense, must be cost-effective [42]. Artificial intelligence systems minimizing the medical manpower necessary for effective patient management are required. Such software would maximally reduce social and medical expenses. In fact, such a program (System for Automatic Verification, or SAVE) was recently applied in Copyright \u00a9 2015 Korean Endocrine Society clinical research, and reduced physician labor by 50%, thus affording efficiency, stability, and economic benefit.

This form of care, the new paradigm of chronic disease management, will require extensive innovations in medical equipment, wireless communications, computer databases, and software processing large amounts of data. The U-healthcare system has three particular requirements ( Fig. 1): monitoring devices and sensors that measure biometric data; networks that transmit data; and medical analyses of, and responses to, the data. U-healthcare will be in increasing demand when all three requirements are met. Mobile devices like Smartphones and tablets are becoming ubiquitous and increasingly powerful. Sensing devices and networks will become more sophisticated, enhancing medical applications in chronic disease management. Currently, both the necessary sensing devices and networking facilities are inadequate. Evidence-based improvements and proof of successful clinical application are essential. Governments should financially support commercial concerns and hospitals that combine to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of U-healthcare. Simultaneously, a large clinical research team should be formed. The team should include representatives of government; corporations producing and developing the necessary equipment, services, and systems; and hospitals and clinics supporting U-healthcare. Committed long-term governmental support is essential to ensure the immediate application of programs that are demonstrably effective and stable.",
