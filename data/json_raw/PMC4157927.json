In the current study, we evaluated the effects of postnatal treadmill exercise on short-term memory in relation with cell proliferation and apoptosis in the hippocampus of rat pups born to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic maternal rats. Adult female rats were mated with male rats for 24 h. Two weeks after mating, the pregnant female rats were divided into two groups: control group and STZ injection group. The pregnant rats in the STZ injection group were administered 40 mg/kg of STZ intraperitoneally. After birth, the rat pups were divided into the following four groups: control group, control with postnatal exercise group, maternal STZ-injection group, and maternal STZ-injection with postnatal exercise group. The rat pups in the postnatal exercise groups were made to run on a treadmill for 30 min once a day, 5 times per week for 2 weeks beginning 4 weeks after birth. The rat pups born to diabetic rats were shown to have short-term memory impairment with suppressed cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Postnatal treadmill exercise alleviated short-term memory impairment by increased cell proliferation and suppressed apoptosis in the rat pups born to diabetic rats. These findings indicate that postnatal treadmill exercise may be used as a valuable strategy to ameliorate neurodevelopmental problems in children born to diabetics.",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus is known to exert detrimental effects on the development of the fetus during pregnancy. These effects primarily occur in the central nervous system (CNS) and are associated with long-term neurologic dysfunction, such as deficits in attention, cognitive function, motor control, and perception during childhood (Aberg and Westbom, 2001). In addition, there is abundant epidemiologic and experimental evidence demonstrating a close correlation between the degree of maternal glycemic control and the intelligence and behavior of infants born to diabetic mothers (Suh et al., 2005;van Assche et al., 2001). Furthermore, the fetal environment during a pregnancy complicated by diabetes is characterized by chronic hypoxia and iron deficiency, accompanied by intermittent acute changes in glucose status and acidemia (Nelson et al., 2000). All of these conditions can cause damage to the development of the fetal brain, particularly the hippocampus (Nelson et al., 2000;Raman et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The term apoptosis was coined by Kerr et al. (Kerr et al., 1972). Apoptosis is a form of cell death that involves scattered discrete cells rather than a confluent volume of tissues. Apoptosis is characterized by a series of distinctive morphologic changes, including shrinkage of cells, marked condensation of chromatin, formation of cytoplasmic protuberances on the surface of cells, and fragmentation of cells by separation of the protuberances to form multiple small membrane-bound bodies that contain intact organelles and/ or dense clumps of condensed chromatin (Wyllie et al., 1981). Apoptotic cell death can be assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, which detects DNA fragmentation (Kim et al., 2010). In addition, another important characteristic of apoptotsis is the activation of caspase-3, which is a family of cysteinyl proteases and one of the key mediators of apoptosis in mammalian cells (Kim et al., 2010). Bax is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that is predominantly localized in the cytosol of healthy cells, and translocates to the mitochondria after a variety of death stimuli (Cory and Adams, 2002). Once Bax translocates to the mitochondria where it forms homo-and hetero-dimers or clusters, interacts with other members of the Bcl-2 family, causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and finally induces apoptotic cell death (Antonsson et al., 2001).",

Exercise also up-regulates the production of neuropeptides and neurotrophins, such as neurotensin, substance P, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in the rat hippocampus. These neurotransmitters are implicated in neuronal survival, differentiation, connectivity, and synaptic plasticity (Chen et al., 1999;Kim et al., 2014). Exercise is also known as a useful intervention for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Regular physical exercise is effective for preventing and delaying the onset of symptoms and complications of diabetes, and exercise also increases insulin sensitivity and ameliorates disturbances in glucose metabolism (Derouich and Boutayeb, 2002). Physical exercise increases blood flow, enhances glucose uptake in muscles, reduces the level of triglycerides, and improves endothelial function (Chakraphan et al., 2005). Insulin resistance and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion play important roles in regulating glucose homeostasis (Kaastra et al., 2006).",

A single high-dose of STZ exerts irreversible damage to insulin-producing cells, therefore STZ has been extensively used to induce insulindependent (type 1) diabetes in animals (Kim et al., 2003). Maternal diabetes during pregnancy causes memory deficits in a hippocampal-dependent task of offspring (DeBoer et al., 2005). It has been suggested that infants of diabetic mothers experienced perturbation in memory performance due to exposure to multiple neurologic risk factors, including chronic hypoxia, hyperglycemia/ reactive hypoglycemia, and iron deficiency (DeBoer et al., 2005). In the present study, the rat pups born to diabetic rats had delayed latency in the step-down avoidance task, suggesting memory impairment.",

After 8 weeks of poorly-controlled diabetes, the prototypic caspases of the extrinsic cell death pathway were activated (Wajant, 2002), possibly explaining the increased death rate. Kuhad et al. (2009) reported that diabetes increased caspase-3 activity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In the present study, the numbers of caspase-3-positive, Bax-positive, and TUNEL-positive cells were increased in rat pups born to diabetic rats. Sim et al. (2004) reported that treadmill exercise significantly suppresses ischemia-induced increase in DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 expression in the hippocampus, and thus facilitates the recovery of short-term memory impairment. Treadmill exercise suppresses apoptosis in the hippocampus of STZ-induced diabetic rats (Lee et al., 2005). Ghosh et al. (2009) reported that moderate exercise reduces caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities in diabetic mice. Williamson et al. (2010) reported that diabetic cardiac mitochondria apoptosis was attenuated in exercised animals, as indicated by Bax expression and caspase-3 activity. A reduction in caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities induced by exercise is related with reduced oxidative damage, and underlies the beneficial effects of exercise in diabetic mice (Ghosh et al., 2009). In the present study, postnatal treadmill exercise suppressed the number of caspase-3positive, Bax-positive, and TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of rat pups born to diabetic rats, demonstrating that postnatal treadmill exercise alleviated diabetic-induced apoptotic neuronal cell death in rat pups.",
