A case-cohort design was implemented using data from 10 US study sites participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network. The 1994 birth cohort included 253,347 study-site births with complete parental age information. Cases included 1,251 children aged 8 years with complete parental age information from the same birth cohort and identified as having an autism spectrum disorder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision criteria. After adjustment for the other parent's age, birth order, maternal education, and other covariates, both maternal and paternal age were independently associated with autism (adjusted odds ratio for maternal age 35 vs. 25-29 years \u00bc 1.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.6; adjusted odds ratio for paternal age 40 years vs. 25-29 years \u00bc 1.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.8). Firstborn offspring of 2 older parents were 3 times more likely to develop autism than were third-or later-born offspring of mothers aged 20-34 years and fathers aged <40 years (odds ratio \u00bc 3.1, 95% confidence interval: 2.0, 4.7). The increase in autism risk with both maternal and paternal age has potential implications for public health planning and investigations of autism etiology.",

The possibility that autism is more common in offspring of older parents has generated considerable interest (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6). Confirmation of such an association could have important public health implications in light of increasing trends in recent decades regarding both maternal and paternal age (7). In addition, evidence of paternal and maternal age effects on autism risk may provide clues to the etiology of a class of neurodevelopmental disorder that is still poorly understood and thought to be complex and multifactoral.",

We used 2 data sources to construct the cohort: 1994 deidentified birth records for the Wisconsin study area provided by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services and, for the remaining sites, the National Center for Health Statistics public use natality data files (9). The public use file includes county of residence for births in densely populated counties, which enabled us to ascertain deidentified birth information for all births in most of the counties. We were unable to precisely obtain counts of births occurring in sparsely populated counties in which 13,043 (4.1%) of the study-area births occurred in 1994. For these counties, we obtained countylevel aggregate information on the total number of births in 1994 and their distribution by variables such as maternal marital status, ethnicity, and age and selected a stratified random sample of deidentified birth records (equal in number and similar in distribution by maternal marital status, ethnicity, and age to all livebirths occurring in the respective counties in 1994) from sparsely populated counties of the state in which the study area was located. The full cohort included 326,785 livebirths, of which 73,438 (22.5%) were excluded because of missing paternal age. The cohort serving as the comparison group thus included the 253,347 livebirths with complete information on parental age and other key variables ( Table 1).",

Unadjusted odds ratios with confidence intervals were computed to evaluate the magnitude of these associations, and unconditional logistic regression models were fit to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

To evaluate interaction or modifying effects of each covariate and of ASD subtypes on the associations between parental age and ASD, we performed stratified analyses.

However, the observation that these effects are independent of each other and of low birth order raises the likelihood that the combined effects of parental age and birth order may have important public health implications. Mean maternal age in the United States has increased steadily since the 1970s, particularly for firstborn children, for whom mean maternal age at delivery increased by 3.8 years between 1970 and 2004 (16). In addition, the proportion of births to women aged 35 years began increasing in the United States after 1980, when it was 5%; by 2004, it had increased to 14.2% (17,18). During this same period, fertility rates for men aged 40 years also increased each year, while fertility among men aged <30 years declined (16). With the decline in average family size in recent decades, we would also expect the proportion of children who are firstborn to have increased. Similar trends are occurring in other developed countries (7). The results of this study raise the question of whether some portion of the recent rise in ASD prevalence (19) may be linked to recent trends in parental age and family size. A further question is whether a modest increase in prevalence associated with advancing parental age and low birth order may have contributed to a greater awareness of ASD and, in turn, increases in measured prevalence. The tendency for older parents of firstborn children to have higher levels of educational achievement and resources than other parents could further contribute to increased awareness and an expansion of the diagnosis of ASD.",

The independent effect of maternal age, on the other hand, may point to age-related chromosome changes, pregnancy complications, or environmental exposures during pregnancy. Independent effects of 1 or both parents' ages also could point to a role of accumulated environmental exposures that may have mutagenic effects on gametes or could result from a combination of mechanisms (21,22).",

Even though we have no information about exposure to these treatments in our cohort, the observation that firstborn children of older parents had the highest ASD risk is consistent with a possible infertility treatment effect because women who give birth after infertility treatment are more likely to be primiparous than those represented in the general birth cohort. However, the association between multiple birth and ASD in this study was weak and not statistically significant ( Table 3, unadjusted odds ratio), whereas assisted reproduction technologies are strongly associated with multiple birth (23).",

According to this hypothesis, firstborn children are exposed to fewer infections from other children early in childhood and, because of delayed immunologic challenge, may be more likely to develop autoimmune responses including those that may adversely affect neurodevelopment (29). Another possible factor that could lead to the observed birthorder effect is exposure to potentially neurotoxic, fat-soluble chemicals accumulated in maternal tissue that have been passed to offspring transplacentally or through breast milk (30). Because of accumulation over a lifetime, the load of such neurotoxins transmitted might be expected to be highest for firstborn children, particularly when combined with advanced maternal age. Another possible explanation for the observed birth order effect is ''stoppage'' or a tendency for parents of 1 child with ASD not to have subsequent children because of the demands of parenting a child with a disability or concerns about genetic susceptibility (31), thus increasing the likelihood in the cohort as a whole that a child with ASD will have a low birth order. Information available for the present study did not allow examination of these hypotheses.",

Because this exclusion applied to both the ASD cases and the comparison group (Table 1), we would not expect it to have resulted in biased estimates of the association between ASD and parental age. In a separate analysis, we examined the association between maternal age and ASD without adjusting for paternal age and including the full birth cohort, and we found the association between maternal age and ASD to be the same as that observed in the subcohort with paternal age.",

Because of this limitation, we could not estimate cumulative incidence of ASD. Nonetheless, this limitation is unlikely to have biased the estimated odds ratios reported in this study, particularly those adjusted for factors such as gestational age and birth weight for gestational age, which are strongly associated with postnatal mortality. Another possible explanation for the increase in ASD among offspring of older parents, but one we cannot evaluate with the data available, is that, compared with younger parents, older parents may be more aware of developmental abnormalities and better able to access diagnostic and special educational services. Other limitations are that parity pertains to only mothers and does not take into account the number of previous births fathered by the fathers represented in the cohort, potential for residual confounding by factors not measured in the present study, possible misclassification of ASD case status, and missing information on paternal education.",
