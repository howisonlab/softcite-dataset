We examined how a natural micropolymorphism in HLA-B44, an important and large HLA allelic family, affected antigen recognition. T cell-mediated immunity to an Epstein-Barr virus determinant (EENLLDFVRF) is enhanced when HLA-B*4405 was the presenting allotype compared with HLA-B*4402 or HLA-B*4403, each of which differ by just one amino acid. The micropolymorphism in these HLA-B44 allotypes altered the mode of binding and dynamics of the bound viral epitope. The structure of the TCR-HLA-B*4405 EENLLDFVRF complex revealed that peptide fl exibility was a critical parameter in enabling preferential engagement with HLA-B*4405 in comparison to HLA-B*4402/03. Accordingly, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) polymorphism can alter the dynamics of the peptide-MHC landscape, resulting in fi ne-tuning of T cell responses between closely related allotypes."

Maintenance of HLA polymorphism refl ects natural selection for enhanced protective immunity against the pathogens encountered by humans ( 1 ). The MHC molecules can diff er from each other by either > 30 amino acids or only a few amino acids (micropolymorphism). This MHC-I polymorphism is generally concentrated in the antigen-binding cleft, controlling the size and diversity of the peptide repertoire presented by each HLA molecule. For instance, HLA-B44 molecules will preferentially bind peptides that possess a P2-glutamate ( 2 ). Alleles from each of the HLA families are distributed in virtually all human populations, indicating that their maintenance refl ects an adaptable strategy for protective immunity toward diverse microbial ligands. Although it is recognized that HLA polymorphism can alter the peptide-MHC (pMHC) landscape, it remains unclear at the atomic level how HLA polymorphism directly aff ects TCR recognition.",

More globally, it is apparent that three positions (65, 69, and 155 in MHC-I) are invariably contacted by the TCR and, thus, may represent a minimal MHC restriction element ( 8 ). However, in the mouse-based systems, the structures of TCRs ligated to H2-K b and H2-L d MHC molecules have only been reported, and in humanbased MHC-I systems, TCR co-complex structures have been limited to HLA-A2, HLA-B8, and HLA-B35 ( 3,5 ). Accordingly, the potential diversity as well as the possible generalities of the TCR -pMHC interaction may be underor overestimated, respectively, by the limited number of distinct HLA allotypes that have been studied. Although the H2-K b mutant system has to an extent unraveled the impact of micropolymorphism on MHC structure and function ( 9,10 ), it is nevertheless important to study the impact of naturally selected microvariation in HLA allotypes found in outbred human populations.",

For example, mismatching of HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403 is associated with transplant rejection and acute graft-versus-host disease, indicating that they represent signifi cant barriers to clinical transplantation ( 13 ). In addition, although HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403 are dependent on tapasin for the loading of their peptide cargo, HLA-B*4405 is tapasin independent, and this feature engenders this allotype with a reduced susceptibility to viral evasion of immune responses ( 12 ).",

The data collection and structure determination of the ternary complex was challenging, as the crystal form exhibited a cell edge close to 700 \u00c5 with three complexes in the asymmetric unit. Given that we had solved the structures of the nonliganded counterparts of the ternary complex, the structure nevertheless refi ned readily at this resolution, and moreover, the electron density at the DM1 TCR -HLA-B*4405 EENL interface was unambiguous ( Fig. 4 b ). The three complexes in the asymmetric unit were structurally identical. An overlay of the three complexes showed an overall r.m.s.d. of < 1.4 \u00c5 , where major diff erences were in the diff ering juxtapositioning of the \u2424 2 -microglobulin ( \u2424 2 m) domain (the r.m.s.d. without the \u2424 2 m domain is 0.7 \u00c5 ). Thus, unless explicitly stated, structural analysis is restricted to one complex in the asymmetric unit. The DM1 TCR docked at an angle of 80 \u00b0 across the long axis of the HLA-B*4405 EENL binding cleft, and accordingly, the DM1 TCR docked within the range of previously determined TCR -pMHC structures ( Fig. 4 c )  ( 5 ). The DM1 TCR was essentially centrally located above HLA-B*4405 EENL and formed fi ve H bonds, eight salt bridges, and a large number of vdw interactions ( Table II ). The total buried surface area (BSA) was \u202b\u0641\u202c 2,200 \u00c5 2 , which lies within the range of previously determined TCR -pMHC-I structures ( 3 ).",

The DM1 and LC13 TCRs share similarities in the CDR1 \u2423 , CDR2 \u2423 , CDR1 \u2424 , and CDR2 \u2424 loops (for sequence conservation see Table S2, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/ jem.20082136/DC1) ( 22,23 ). In comparison to the LC13 footprint on HLA-B8 FLRGRAYGL , the CDR1 \u2423 and CDR2 \u2423 loops are in roughly equivalent locations, although the positioning of the corresponding loops in the V \u2424 domain is more divergent ( Fig. 6, a and b ). From examination of all known TCR -pMHC co-crystal structures, it has been noted that TCRs often use a Tyr/Phe in the CDR1 \u2423 to interact with the HLA-B*4405 EENL interaction, albeit to varying degrees, which is consistent with the variable usage of CDR loops observed in TCR -pMHC-I interactions ( 3, 18 -20 ). The CDR1 \u2423 and CDR2 \u2423 loops of DM1 TCR contributed 18 and 7.8%, respectively, and the CDR1 \u2424 and CDR2 \u2424 loops contributed 7 and 11.8%, respectively, to the BSA. In contrast, the CDR3 loops played a more prominent role, with the CDR3 \u2423 and CDR3 \u2424 loops contributing 19.6 and 17%, respectively, of the BSA at the DM1 TCR -HLA-B*4405 EENL interface.",

Indeed, both DM1 and LC13 use an aromatic residue to contact Gln 155 , as well as a Gly 30 \u2423 to contact Ala 158 ( Fig. 6 c ). Moreover, although CDR2 \u2423 played a minor role in interacting with HLA-B44, both the DM1 TCR and the LC13 TCR use a Leu at the same position in CDR2 \u2423 to conserve the interaction with Glu 154 ( Fig. 6 c ). Although it has been suggested that a Ser in the CDR2 \u2423 loop will contact the MHC at position 154 -155 ( 24 ), this has not been observed in the DM1 TCR complex or other TCR -pMHC complexes. Although the positioning of the CDR2 \u2424 loops is was reminiscent of the highly specifi c interaction between the KK50.4 -HLA-E LIL interaction ( 27 ), and is likely to be a key driver in determining the specifi city of the DM1 TCR -HLA-B*4405 EENL interaction, which is consistent with the peptide substitution data. Accordingly, the DM1 TCR made a number of critical interactions with the centrally bulged region of the epitope, which is the region that displayed the greatest degree of variability between the HLA-B*4405 EENL , HLA-B* 4402 EENL , and HLA-B*4403 EENL binary complexes.",

Upon ligation, the CDR3 \u2423 loop reorientated the P4-Leu side chain, which consequently appeared to push the peptide toward the \u2423 1 helix, resulting in the complete shift of the backbone conformation of P5-Leu and P6-Asp ( Fig. 7 a ). In addition, the side chain of P7-Phe, which was mobile in the nonliganded form ( Fig. 4 c ), became completely ordered via interactions with the CDR3 \u2424 loop. The repositioning of the peptide enabled the CDR1 \u2424 , CDR3 \u2423 , and CDR3 \u2424 loops to interact with positions 3 -7 and 9 of the determinant. CDR1 \u2424 played a major role in interacting with the peptide courtesy of some large side chains bridging the gap between the C \u2423 backbones of the CDR1 \u2424 loop and peptide (specifi cally, P6-Asp salt bridges to Arg 31 \u2424 and the P9-Arg H bonds to Asn 30 \u2424 and Arg 31 \u2424 ; Fig. 7 b ). The CDR3 \u2423 loop interacted with the middle region of the peptide ( Fig. 7 b ) in which Tyr 110 \u2423 and Trp 107 \u2423 played a prominent role in this interaction. Tyr 110 \u2423 packed against P4-Leu and Trp 107 \u2423 interacted with P6-Asp and P7-Phe. Notably an analysis of the \u2423 chain repertoire of HLA-B*4405 EENL -specifi c TCRs from other HLA-B*4405 + , EBVexposed individuals (Table S3, available at http://www.jem .org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082136/DC1) revealed that this Trp is highly conserved despite this residue being encoded entirely from the N region. Furthermore, Trp is encoded by a single codon (TGG), and there is therefore a theoretically low (1 out of 64) probability of this codon appearing by coincidence ( 26 ). This bulky Trp residue also helped to orientate the CDR3 \u2424 loop, which abutted the C-terminal end of the peptide in an antiparallel manner. The main chain of Ser 112 \u2424 and Tyr 113 \u2424 \" sat \" on the P7-Phe, whereas the P9-Arg protruded into a niche formed between the CDR1 \u2424 and CDR3 \u2424 loops, forming an H bond to Asp 110 \u2424 O ( Fig. 7 b ). The interactions include a salt bridge between P6-Asp and Arg 107 \u2424 as well as P9-Arg and Asp 110 \u2424 ( Fig. 7 b ). The cluster of charged interactions between the DM1 TCR (Arg 31 \u2424 and Arg 107 \u2424 ) and the peptide (P6-Asp and P9-Arg)  with HLA-B35, and one each is with H2-L d and HLA-B8 ( 3 ). Accordingly, any generalities proposed could potentially be skewed toward a particular MHC allele. For example, although common pairwise interactions are observed in defi ned V \u2424 8.2 -MHC interactions ( 6,7 ), this generality does not extend to V \u2424 8.2 -CD1d interactions ( 31,32 ). The HLA-B*4405 -restricted DM1 TCR exhibits similar V \u2423 and V \u2424 usage to the LC13 TCR, whose cognate antigen is HLA-B8, but also alloreacts on HLA-B44 ( 33 ). Although the respective V \u2424 domains showed a large degree of variation in docking, there was some similarity in the interaction mode within the CDR1 and CDR2 loops. However, mutational mapping has shown that for the LC13 -HLA B8 FLR interaction, the energetic driving force for the interaction rested not in the CDR1 and CDR2 loops but in the CDR3 loops ( 18 ). Perhaps the diff erent docking modes of the LC13 and DM1 TCRs may relate to a given V gene \" selecting \" an orientation that is specifi c for a given MHC allotype. The distinct docking modes observed may represent two examples of several potential germline-encoded modes of interaction, with each being \" selected \" to optimize interactions with the distinct peptides presented by the specifi c MHC allotype.",

            "text": "Studies on the experimental H2-K b /K bm3 system have indicated how a buried polymorphism can aff ect peptide presentation that leads to an increase in V \u2424 -mediated interactions ( 10 ). Similarly, studies in the H2-K b /K bm8 system provided some evidence to suggest that very subtle diff erences between the alleles, which may include diff ering pMHC dynamics, can aff ect TCR recognition ( 9 ). The eff ect of buried HLA polymorphism on peptide conformation/dynamics has implications in graft-versus-host disease. Namely, donor T cells that have escaped thymic deletion caused by being weakly autoreactive toward a given pMHC may recognize very similar recipient pMHC complexes with much greater affi nity because of the changes in the peptide conformation/ dynamics. For example, the eff ect of MHC micropolymorphism on TCR recognition has been observed in comparative studies between HLA-B*3501 and HLA-B*3508. ( 34,35 ). Similarly, mismatching of HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403, two allomorphs that diff er by just one amino acid, is a known barrier in transplantation and has been termed a \" taboo mismatch \" ( 13 ). In this case, the polymorphism was shown to subtly aff ect the peptide repertoire, the conformation of the peptide, and the MHC itself ( 11 ). Moreover, within the HLA-B*3501/B*3508 setting, it has also been established that the immunogenicity of a viral epitope is controlled by the conformation of the peptide within the antigen-binding cleft ( 36 ), and our data resonate with these fi ndings. Such eff ects on TCR recognition of viral determinants may be an important consideration for future vaccination strategies against viruses, as markedly diff erent CTL responses to the same viral epitope may be elicited in individuals expressing closely related HLA types.",

            "text": "TCR degeneracy is considered to be an important factor enabling TCRs to bind a wide range of potential pMHC combinations with the limited number of T cells present in allotypes fi nely tunes the CTL response toward an EBV determinant. The micropolymorphisms between these allotypes are not accessible to the TCR, and they did not appreciably aff ect the conformation of the MHC. Nevertheless, the DM1 TCR recognized the HLA-B*4405 allotype, presenting an EBV epitope, with a 10-fold increase in affi nity when compared with HLA-B*4403 and HLA-B*4402. This is attributable to the altered conformation and dynamics of the peptide within the respective antigen-binding clefts. Specifi cally, residues 4 -7 of the EBV epitope varied between the allotypes, with the epitope displaying a greater degree of mobility in HLA-B*4405. The signifi cance of this variability and the dynamics of the epitope was apparent in the DM1 TCR -HLA-B*4405 EENL complex, whereby the DM1 TCR not only contacted this mobile region but also caused a radical reshaping of the peptide upon ligation. In addition, the slow association rates (K on ) for the DM1 TCR interaction with all three pMHC complexes are consistent with marked conformational rearrangement occurring at the TCR -pMHC interface, which further refl ects the underlying fl exibility of the TCR -pMHC interface ( 30 ). Interestingly, the on rate for the DM1 TCR -HLA-B*4405 EENL interaction was approximately sixfold higher when compared with the interactions with HLA-B*4403 EENL and HLA-B*4402 EENL . This is consistent with the increased fl exibility of the EENL epitope in HLA-B*4405 facilitating the DM1 TCR docking, whereas the more \" rigid \" HLA-B*4403 EENL and HLA-B*4402 EENL complexes would be less favorable for DM1 TCR engagement.",

In brief, CTLs were assayed against 51 Cr-labeled autologous PHA blast targets that were pretreated with synthetic peptide or left untreated. The percentage of specifi c lysis was calculated, and the peptide concentration required for half-maximum lysis was determined from dose -response curves. Peptides were synthesized by Mimotopes Ltd. Toxicity testing of all peptides was performed before use by adding peptide to 51 Cr-labeled PHA blasts in the absence of CTL eff ectors. A \u2424 scintillation counter (Topcount Microplate; PerkinElmer) was used to measure 51 Cr levels in assay supernatant samples. The mean spontaneous lysis for target cells in the culture medium was always < 20%, and the variation from the mean specifi c lysis was < 10%.",

To assess peptide binding to HLA-B*4405, HLA stabilization studies were conducted using the mutant HLA-A/B null lymphoblastoid cell line C1R ( 51 ) that had been transfected to expressed HLA-B*4405 and the herpes virus -derived protein ICP47, which inhibits the transporter associated with antigen processing. These cells were incubated in serum-free medium (AIM V; Invitrogen) with various concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, or 100 \u03bc M) of peptides at 26 \u00b0 C for 14 -16 h, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0 C for 2 -3 h. HLA-B*4405 surface expression was measured by fl ow cytometry on a FACSCanto (BD) using an mAb to HLA-Bw4. Mean fl uorescence intensity was determined, and the peptide concentration required for half-maximum mean fl uorescence intensity was calculated."

T cells specifi c for the EENL peptide were fi rst isolated from bulk EENL-specifi c CTL cultures raised from two HLA-B*4405 + family members of donor DM (from whom the DM1 CTL clone was raised) by stimulation of PBMCs with the EENL peptide, followed by expansion in rIL-2 -containing medium for 10 d. Using fl ow cytometric cell sorting, CTLs that bound an HLA-B*4405 EENL tetramer and costained with anti-CD3 and anti-CD8 mAbs (BD) were isolated. The sorting was performed on a MoFlo sorter (Dako), and purities of > 96% were consistently achieved. Total RNA was extracted from the sorted CTLs using TRI zol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR and PCR was performed using a One-Step PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer ' s guidelines.
