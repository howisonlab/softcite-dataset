Our previous study has revealed that TCF21 is frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation in both CRC cell lines and primary CRC, with TCF21 methylation being significantly correlated with lymph node invasion. In this study, we further analyze the expression of TCF21 in CRC tissues and investigate the role of TCF21 in CRC in vitro and in vivo. We also explore the possible pathway regulated by TCF21. We thus demonstrate that decreased levels of TCF21 are associated with the pathological stage, clinical stage and lymph node metastasis, indicating a poor prognosis in CRC patients; overexpression of TCF21 inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion in the colorectal cell lines HCT116 and HT29. Furthermore, TCF21 functions as a tumor suppressor probably through inactivation of PI3K/ AKT signaling and inhibition of MMPs. Our results suggest that enhancement of TCF21 levels may be a potential strategy to facilitate the prevention and treatment of CRC in the clinic.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become a major public health problem, ranking as the third most common among all cancer types, which is responsible for 8%-9% of cancer-related deaths in the world. 1 TCF21, located in 6q23, is known to function as a tumor suppressor and is deregulated in several types of cancers, including breast cancer, gastric cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). [2][3][4][5] The loss of function of TCF21 is associated with epigenetic alterations in different types of human cancers. For example, the methylation level of TCF21 in gastric cancer samples is much higher than that in samples of normal adjacent tissue; moreover, treatment with DNA methyltransferase can upregulate the expression of TCF21 in gastric cancer cells. 5 TCF21 genetic polymorphisms are associated with the risk of breast cancer in Chinese women. 6 Our previous study has revealed that TCF21 is frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation in both CRC cell lines and primary CRC and that TCF21 methylation is significantly correlated with lymph node invasion. 7 However, the role of TCF21 in CRC and the underlying mechanism remain unclear.",

Among 82 cases of adjacent tissues, 76 cases showed positive expression of TCF21, with a 92.7% (76/82) positive expression rate. However, among 82 cases of CRC, only 59 cases showed positive expression of TCF21, with a 72.0% (59/82) positive expression rate, which was significantly lower than in adjacent tissues. The association between TCF21 protein expression and clinicopathologic features in patients with CRC was analyzed using the \u03c7 2 test. As shown in Table 1, the TCF21 protein expression had no association with the patient's age and sex (P.0.05). However, its protein expression showed association with the pathological stage, clinical stage and lymph node metastasis (P,0.05).

Nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated       with human CRC HCT116 cells infected with blank Lv and TCF21-expressing Lv, respectively. The cells without any treatment were used as mock control. The volumes of the tumors were monitored every 5 days. After 30 days, the mice were sacrificed to remove the tumors. The average tumor volume in the Lv-NC group was significantly higher than that in the Lv-TCF21 group (Figure 6A and B). These results of the in vivo experiments suggest that TCF21 could significantly inhibit human CRC xenograft growth in nude mice. Furthermore, we also analyzed the expression \u03b2 of downstream molecules of TCF21 in xenograft tumor tissues. We confirmed that upregulation of TCF21 significantly increased the expression of Kiss-1 while decreasing the expression of PI3K and p-AKT, indicating an inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling ( Figure 6C).

It has been demonstrated that TCF21 was aberrantly methylated and silenced in the majority of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinomas and non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). 11 And restoration of exogenous expression of TCF21 in cells that have silenced the endogenous TCF21 results in a reduction of tumor properties both in vitro and in vivo. 11 By using the DNA sequencing technique and quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, Shivapurkar et al 12 found that the CpG island within exon 1 of the TCF21 gene was unmethylated in normal lung epithelial cells but predominantly methylated in lung cancer cell lines, which has been found in multiple other malignancies. Hypermethylation and decreased expression of TCF21 may be tumor specific and very frequent in all NSCLCs, even early-stage disease. 13 It is important for the early detection and surveillance of lung cancer as well as multiple other malignancies. TCF21 methylation levels have been reported to provide a sensitivity rate of 92% for bladder cancer, 67% for renal cell tumors and 96% for prostate cancer. 14 TCF21 methylation level is significantly increased in ccRCC. Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrates that low expression of TCF21 is an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in patients with ccRCC. 4,15 Emerging evidence also demonstrates that hypermethylation of TCF21 is observed in breast cancer, gastric cancer and head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, 2,5,16,17 which is in line with our previous results on CRC, 7 indicating that aberrant methylation is an important reason for the downregulation of the expression of TCF21 and may be associated with tumorigenesis in multiple types of cancer.",

Subsequent research has revealed that KiSS-1 is the strongest independent prognostic factor among the conventional prognosticators for gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. [18][19][20][21] Furthermore, KiSS-1 has an antiproliferative effect on cancer cells and could be responsible for decreased tumor growth and increased cancer patient survival. 18 MMPs can degrade the extracellular matrix and thus promote the process of tumor metastasis. MMP9 and MMP2, two of the most important proteases related with tumor metastasis, are capable of degrading the primary structure of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane to promote tumor metastasis. 22 Induced overexpression of KiSS-1 in HT-1080 cells resulted in reduced transcription and activity of MMP9 and thereby a marked reduction in invasion in vitro. Consequently, the reduced synthesis of MMP9 induces certain inhibitory effects on the mobility and invasion of cancer cells. 23 In addition, KiSS-1 treatment has been shown to elicit a strong and sustained phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and pAKT. 24 Recently, Arab et al 25 have found that TCF21 binds the promoter of the melanoma metastasis-suppressing gene, KiSS1, and enhances its expression through interaction with E12 and with TCF12. Loss of TCF21 expression results in loss of KiSS1 expression through loss of direct interaction of TCF21 at the KiSS1 promoter. Additionally, microRNA (miR)-21 can downregulate the expression of TCF21, and the expression of KiSS-1 is downregulated in Caki-1 cells with TCF21 gene silencing. 3 In CRC, KiSS-1 overexpression significantly decreases the cell proliferation and invasiveness of HCT-119 cells as well as enhancing cell apoptosis. Overexpression of KiSS-1 also results in blockade of synthesis of MMP9 and PI3K, as well as the inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, treatment with PI3K and Akt agonists attenuates the effect of KiSS-1 on the biological activity of CRC cells. 24 Taken together, our results suggest that TCF21 induces Kiss-1 expression and subsequently results in downregulation of MMPs and inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling to exert its inhibitory function on CRC.",
