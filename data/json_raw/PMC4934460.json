Objectives: This paper aims to identify a robust and reliable method for the extrapolation of overall survival (OS) in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer receiving lenvatinib or placebo. Methods: Data from 392 patients (lenvatinib: 261, placebo: 131) from the SELECT trial are used over a 34-month period of follow-up. A previously published criterion-based approach is employed to ascertain credible estimates of OS beyond the trial data. Parametric models with and without a treatment covariate and piecewise models are used to extrapolate OS, and a holistic approach, where a series of statistical and visual tests are considered collectively, is taken in determining the most appropriate extrapolation model. Results: A piecewise model, in which the Kaplan-Meier survivor function is used over the trial period and an extrapolated tail is based on the Exponential distribution, is identified as the optimal model. Conclusion: In the absence of long-term survival estimates from clinical trials, survival estimates often need to be extrapolated from the available data. The use of a systematic method based on a priori determined selection criteria provides a transparent approach and reduces the risk of bias. The extrapolated OS estimates will be used to investigate the potential long-term benefits of lenvatinib in the treatment of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer patients and populate future cost-effectiveness analyses.",

The trial was designed to allow patients randomized to the placebo group to receive optional open-label lenvatinib at the time of confirmed disease progression. Over the 34-month period of follow-up of the SELECT, lenvatinib was found to prolong PFS by almost 15 months compared with placebo (hazard ratio =0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14-0.31). 11 While PFS is an important and significant measure of treatment success, OS is a key outcome for patients and health care providers. A high value is placed on OS by health technology assessment bodies, and it is a key component of cost-effectiveness models for long-term conditions. However, benefits in OS often prove difficult to demonstrate, particularly due to the limited duration of clinical trials, whereas PFS clinical trial data are often more complete. Although PFS at 34 months of follow-up for the placebo and lenvatinib arms in SELECT was 0% and 33%, respectively, median OS was not reached in either treatment group, meaning that >50% of patients remained alive. 12 Therefore, extrapolation of OS was considered more critical than that of PFS and is the focus of this manuscript.",

As a consequence, although PFS data were unaffected by the crossover design of SELECT, OS survival for the placebo arm was biased, with placebo demonstrating a higher survival than what would have been observed without treatment switching due to the use of open-label lenvatinib. To adjust for this bias, a rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) model was used. 12,14  Table 1 shows the unadjusted and RPSFT-corrected median OS times for the lenvatinib and placebo arms of the SELECT. KM plots for both trial arms have been published by Schlumberger et al. 11 In the current analysis, long-term OS is obtained by extrapolation from the RPSFT-corrected data over the trial period. Time-horizon A 120-month (10-year) time-horizon was chosen in order to mitigate inherent uncertainty in the extrapolation of 34-month OS data over a lifetime-horizon. The 10-year time-horizon was deemed both sufficient to capture meaningful differences in OS and appropriate from an economic perspective since, according to published data, only 10% of patients with RR-DCT survive at 10 years. 1 The restricted mean, truncated at the 10-year time-horizon, was used to facilitate estimates of OS before and after the empirical data cutoff (at 34 months), while the extended mean was used to estimate CIs around the marginal OS difference. The uncertainty around the estimates was measured using the bootstrap method 15 to evaluate the CIs.

            "text": "The extrapolation of OS data used an RPSFT model to correct for potential confounding due to crossover 14 and followed a previously published, systematic method to determine the most suitable approach to extrapolate OS data. 13 The use of this systematic method (involving five criteria) 13 was considered a strength of this analysis. Testing of Criterion 1 regarding the PT assumption was inconclusive as the log-cumulative hazard OS plots from SELECT were relatively straight but not parallel, while the global test for a PT effect was not significant. While some researchers would not consider the evidence regarding the use of the PT assumption to be prohibitive, it is the opinion of the authors that, if using a PT assumption, proof should be presented that individual models and piecewise models (such as the KM model + extrapolated tail) are inferior. Piecewise models use the observed hazard from the clinical trial data by applying the KM survivor estimator over the trial period; thus, they can be superior to parametric models and individual models when their underlying assumptions are inappropriate. Therefore, a piecewise model (ie, KM + extrapolated tail) appeared to be a suitable alternative.",

            "text": "A potential limitation of this analysis is that OS for the placebo arm of the SELECT was obtained by fitting an RPSFT model. Although this approach can be used to correct for potential confounding due to the crossover design of the SELECT, a key assumption in RPSFT models is that the treatment is acting by multiplying survival time by a given factor once patients start receiving active treatment. Therefore, OS during the trial period was obtained by making use of the PT assumption; thus, rejecting the PT assumption on the grounds of the results of Criterion 1 alone may be inappropriate and inconsistent with the overall approach. If overall consistency were to be used as an additional criterion to select the most appropriate extrapolation technique, PT models should be considered as a legitimate option. The AIC/BIC statistics support the use of the Exponential distribution in all cases, but it should be noted that the use of the AIC alone would have identified the Weibull distribution as the best fit to the empirical data under the PT assumption. Furthermore, as the AIC and BIC are not available for piecewise models, they are estimated via the fitting of the full parametric distributions, which are used as a proxy for the tail of the extrapolation. AIC and BIC only reflect a distribution's goodness-of-fit in the presence of empirical data; they do not provide information regarding the appropriateness of the extrapolation. Log-Normal and Log-Logistic curves, irrespective of their AIC/BIC, were excluded a priori under Criterion 3, due to the high risk of a long tail. The ranking of models and distributions was confirmed under the remaining criteria (4 and 5). There is very little difference between the AIC statistics for the first three best \"fitting\" distributions. Consideration as to which distribution provides the best extrapolation of the data, using the AIC in isolation could lead to an analyst choosing the Log-Logistic. However, the results of Criterion 5 would suggest that the use of the Log-Logistic distribution could lead to an unrealistic marginal gain in mean survival.",

The use of a transparent, systematic approach with an a priori selection process is required to facilitate the choice of an extrapolation method while reducing the risk of bias. Although it is tempting to present an extrapolation method that demonstrates the greatest marginal benefits, an appropriate approach should be conservative and fulfill the selection criteria. For the extrapolation of the RPSFT-adjusted OS data in SELECT, a piecewise model was considered the optimal, where the KM survivor function was used for the period of the trial data and the extrapolated tail was modeled using an Exponential distribution. The results presented here should not be considered definitive and should be used alongside expert clinical opinion to inform a final decision; nonetheless, they offer a valuable insight into extrapolation approaches for future comparative analyses.
