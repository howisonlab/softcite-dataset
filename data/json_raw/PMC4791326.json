Here we reported the expression of a novel isoform of TLR3 in human astrocyte cell lines whose message is generated by alternative splicing. The isoform represents the N-terminus of the protein. It lacks many of the leucine-rich repeat domains, the transmembrane domain, and the intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain of TLR3. Type I interferons (interferon-\uf061 and interferon-\uf062) induced the expression of this isoform. Exogenous overexpression of this isoform inhibited interferon regulatory factor 3, signal transducers and activators of transcription 1, and Inhibitor of kappa B \uf061 signaling following stimulation. This isoform of TLR3 also inhibited the production of chemokine interferon-\uf067-inducible protein 10. Our study clearly demonstrated that the expression of this isoform of TLR3 was a negative regulator of signaling pathways and that it was inducible by type I interferons. We also found that this isoform could modulate inflammation in the brain.",

            "text": "Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during viral replication in endolysosomal compartments or on cell surfaces (1). Recognition of viral RNA by TLR3 triggers several intracellular signaling pathways that lead to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor \uf06bB (NF-\uf06bB), and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs) (2,3). TLR3 is expressed in various kinds of cells, including dendritic cells, fibroblasts, intestinal epithelial cells, and astrocytes. Depending on the cell type, TLR3 represents different cellular response (4)(5)(6). Within distinct immunological milieu of the brain, TLR3 has been found to be necessary for the secretion of TNF-\uf061, IL-12p40, and IL-6 in murine microglial cells after being stimulated by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) (7). In viral infections such as experimental infection with simian immunodeficiency virus and human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis, TLR3 expression is upregulated, leading to the induction of active innate immune responses in the brain (8). Following intracerebroventricular administration of poly(I:C) to mimic viral infection in the central nervous system, TLR3 signaling is activated, resulting in contextual memory and enhanced susceptibility to seizures (9,10). Similar effects of viral infection on brain function have been reported in encephalitis and associated epileptic activity (11)(12)(13). These reports suggest that inflammation as innate immune response is important in neurological disorders and in anti-viral defenses.",

In addition, astrocytes play an important role in diseases related to neuro-inflammation (14,15). Astrocytes express numerous PRRs to allow for the recognition of diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (16)(17)(18). We have previously reported that TLR3 is expressed in astrocytes and that its activation induces the expression of IL-6 (19). We have reported that an isoform of TLR3 lacking 192 bp is produced by alternative splicing in primary astrocytes and astrocyte cell lines (20). However, the mechanistic role of this isoform is unclear. In this study, we report a novel isoform of TLR3 that is induced by type I IFNs in astrocyte cell lines. It downregulated poly(I:C)-induced TLR3 signaling. This isoform might have an immune-modulatory function during brain inflammation and other pathological conditions.",

We obtained similar results using three different sets of primers ( Fig. 1A, B).

The alternative splicing occurred between the donor \"GT\" (region of 967-968 bp) and acceptor \"AG\" (region of 2,586-2,587 bp), introducing a frame-shift mutation and a stop codon \"TGA\" at region of 2,621-2,623 bp, resulting in translation of a 299 amino acid polypeptide ( Fig. 1D). http://bmbreports.org  ",

            "text": "Endosomal TLRs such as TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 can recognize nucleic acids derived from viruses and bacteria. They play important roles in innate immunity as well as pathological conditions (21). These TLRs can recognize self-DNA and RNA associated with several autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and psoriasis (22,23). Normally, self-nucleic acids are not detected by endosomal TLRs because there are several regulatory mechanisms, including receptor localization, association with accessory proteins, and proteolytic cleavage (24). For example, proteasemediated regulation of TLR depends on the type of protease that is active. When TLR9 is cleaved by acidic pH-dependent protease such as cathepsins or asparagine endopeptidase, produced C-terminal cleaved fragments of TLR9 can augment TLR9 activation. On the other hand, when TLR9 is cleaved by neutral pH-dependent proteases, produced N-terminal fragments of TLR9 can inhibit TLR9 signaling (25,26). In the brain, TLR3 is abundantly expressed in microglia and astrocytes. TLR3 is active in anti-viral immune responses and some autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (27,28). Recent studies have shown that TLR3 cleavage by cysteine proteases will produce C-or N-terminal fragments that are involved in the activation of the receptor (29)(30)(31).",

It lacks the entire transmembrane and cytoplasmic TIR domains. The expression of this isoform was induced by the treatment with type I IFNs. Interestingly, when the isoform was exogenously overexpressed, poly(I:C)induced TLR3 activation was significantly reduced. Moreover, the secretion of IFN-responsive chemokine IP-10 was decreased in cells overexpressing this isoform. These negative regulatory effects of this TLR3 isoform may be caused by competition for ligand binding because this TLR3 isoform has dsRNA binding sites (LRR1 and LRR3), whereas it lacks the cytoplasmic TIR domain required for signal transduction (25,32).",
