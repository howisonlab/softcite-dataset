To determine the extent to which demographic characteristics, clinical measurements and biomarkers were associated with poor self-reported health (SRH) among Inuit adults in the Canadian Arctic. Study design. Cross-sectional survey was adopted as the study design. Methods. The International Polar Year Inuit Health Survey carried out in 36 Canadian Arctic communities in 2007 and 2008 included Inuit men and women, aged 18 years or older, recruited from randomly selected households. The main outcome measure was SRH, which was dichotomized into good health (excellent, very good and good responses) and poor health (fair and poor responses). Results. Of the 2,796 eligible households, 1,901 (68%) households and 2,595 participants took part in the survey. The weighted prevalence of poor SRH was 27.8%. Increasing age was significantly associated with poor SRH. The relative risk ratios for poor SRH was 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3\u00c13.1) for men aged 50 years or older and 2.3 (95% CI 1.7\u00c13.0) for women aged 50 years or older, compared with men and women aged 29 years or younger. After adjusting for age, gender and body mass index, poor SRH was significantly associated with smoking status (odds ratio [OR]01.5; CI 1.1\u00c12.0), at-risk fasting glucose levels (]6.1 mmol/L) (OR02.5; 95%; CI 1.5\u00c14.2) and elevated hs C-reactive protein levels (!3\u00c1 510 mg/L) (OR02.1; 95% CI 1.4\u00c13.1). Poor SRH was also significantly associated with a hypertriglyceridemic waist phenotype (high-risk waist circumference ]102 cm for men and ]88 cm for women with high triglyceride levels, ]1.7 mmol/L), adjusted for age and gender, OR01.6; 95% CI 1.1\u00c12.3. Conclusions. Clinically relevant indicators of chronic disease risk were related to subjective assessment of SRH among Inuit."

All coastal communities were visited by the Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) Amundsen, which was equipped with research and laboratory facilities. The inland communities were visited by air by separate research crews. Communities provided the researchers with numbered housing lists from which a random sample of households was selected using a random numbers table or computer-generated random digits. All Inuit adults, aged 18 years or older, within the selected households were eligible to participate. Three attempts were made to contact the selected households. Households were visited by locally trained research assistants and survey team members, who explained the study protocol, obtained written consent from individuals and booked clinic appointments on the ship."

            "text": "The present study adds to the limited literature available on biomarkers as they relate to SRH and represents the first investigation, to our knowledge, among Inuit adults in the Canadian Arctic. The most notable findings include the significantly higher OR of poor SRH associated with at-risk fasting glucose levels, at-risk waist circumference with high triglyceride levels and elevated hsCRP levels. Our results contribute to the limited data suggesting that a physiologic basis may be attributed to SRH, as suggested by others (14,17,27). This is the first study to report on a relationship between at-risk fasting blood glucose levels and poor SRH, where those with elevated fasting blood glucose levels were 2.5 times more likely to perceive their health as poor compared with normoglycemic individuals. The poorer assessment of health that was associated with elevated levels of fasting glucose may be the result of physical sensations associated with disease progression, such as fatigue and poor sleep patterns, and important covariates, such as obesity. Further work is needed to explore the intuitive assessment of SRH and its relation to glucose homeostasis, especially in light of recently published results that suggest that Inuit ethnicity no longer prevents the development of diabetes, and the hypertriglyceridemic-waist phenotype is related to risk of fasting glycemia and type 2 diabetes (26). Our results of poorer SRH with a hypertriglyceridemic-waist phenotype provide additional information on the usefulness of SRH, beyond the more traditional objective health indicators. Another interesting finding is the strong association between higher levels of hsCRP and poorer SRH, which is in agreement with other reports, indicating that increasing circulating levels of inflammatory intermediaries can influence health perception and relate to poorer health assessment (17\u00c119). Worth citing is a recent study among relatively healthy older adults that demonstrated that poorer self-rated health was significantly associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein. These associations remained after controlling for age, BMI, gender, objective health conditions, depressive symptoms and other health behaviours (20). Similarly, our results support the aforementioned findings as individuals with high-risk hsCRP levels are twice more likely to report poor health than individuals with low or average risk levels, adjusted for age, gender and BMI. CRP levels have been related to obesity and smoking status (28). Though these associations warrant further investigation, they are beyond the scope of this paper.",

The researchers concluded that SRH acted as a surrogate for disease and reflected subclinical physiological conditions (17). Likewise, a recent study of healthy Japanese men and women concluded that poor SRH was positively correlated with circulating immune markers even after adjusting for confounders (29).",

Older subjects have been noted to report better health than younger subjects (30\u00c132), but the literature provides contradictory results (33,34). Also, women have been noted to report poorer health than men (35), which is not supported by our study as both men and women in the ]50 age group were 2 times more likely to rate their health as poor than their younger counterparts.

Nearly 20% of the adult Inuit population of the 3 regions participated in the survey (2,595 individuals) with 68% of households participating. A further strength of the study is its contribution of new evidence to the emerging body of research linking endocrine and immune-activated responses to SRH and the study's corroboration of existing information on clinical measurements and biomarkers. Furthermore, this study provides additional evidence of the transcultural nature of SRH and its validity among Inuit and possibly other Indigenous populations (37).",

The absolute value of the adjusted OR should be interpreted with caution as they tend to exaggerate the true relative risk for highly prevalent outcomes. Also, access to medical chart data was not available at the time of analyses, but nurses visually inspected and recorded medications taken and those taking medications for diabetes or dyslipidemia were excluded from analyses of fasting blood glucose and lipid-related biomarkers. Furthermore, we excluded individuals with hsCRP levels exceeding 10 mg/L from the hsCRP analysis, evidence of acute inflammation or other organic disease states that could have influenced SRH. However, only 1 marker of inflammation was available for analyses. Another limitation is that study participants received their anthropometric results during their clinic visit and prior to being interviewed, and knowledge of their obesity status may have influenced their responses to the SRH questions."
