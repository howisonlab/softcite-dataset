Consuming both meals could provide 58% of daily intake. This paper evaluates the contribution of SBP and NSLP meals to the dietary intakes of 5-18 year old children participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 2007 through 2012. The participants completed 24-hour dietary recalls. Least-square means and standard errors of the mean for energy and food group intakes for the total day and by school meal, and the percent of daily energy and food groups contributed by school meals were computed by analysis of covariance, with BMI, ethnicity, sex, age and poverty level as covariates. Of the 7800 participating children aged 5-18 years in the entire dataset, 448 consumed both SBP-NSLP meals on a weekday. Almost one-half (47%) of the day's energy intake was provided by the two school meals. For the major food groups, the contribution of school meals ranged from between 40.6% for vegetables to 77.1% for milk. Overall, these results provide important information on contribution of the SBP and NSLP meals to low income children's daily dietary intake.",

Because the SBP and NSLP meals were planned to provide 25% and 33% of student daily energy needs, respectively, children who consumed both meals could have received 58% of their daily intake at school (Fox et al., 2012). The primarily low income students (82%) in the current study group obtained 47% of their daily total energy intake, 58% of fruit, 41% of total vegetables, 52% of total grains, 70% of total milk and 77% of milk from school meals (Table 1).

The race/ethnicity (22% Hispanic, 17% non-Hispanic Black, 54% non-Hispanic White), and weight status (~59% normal weight,~15% overweight and 24% obese) of the SNDA III sample were also similar to the current NHANES study results (Gordon et al., 2007). Up to 51% of daily energy intake was supplied for the SNDA III students who consumed both SBP-NSLP meals, compared to the 47.2% in our study, but no data were provided on the contribution of food groups consumed to total daily intake (Briefel et al., 2009).",

Students have to select at least one serving of a fruit or vegetable for the SBP or NSLP meal to count as a reimbursable meal, under the offer versus serve option, which is optional for elementary schools, but not for middle and high schools (Food and Nutrition Service -U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2012). The opportunity to select more fruit and vegetables at meals may increase student fruit and vegetable consumption. Evaluating the impact of the new school meal patterns on school dietary intakes as well as over 24 h is an important area for future study.",

In addition, measurement errors are associated with self-reported dietary intake. Only 5.7% of the NHANES child participants consumed both a school breakfast and lunch on the recall day and 57% were male, reducing generalizability.
