Consuming both meals could provide 58% of daily intake. This paper evaluates the contribution of SBP and NSLP meals to the dietary intakes of 5-18 year old children participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 2007 through 2012. The participants completed 24-hour dietary recalls. Least-square means and standard errors of the mean for energy and food group intakes for the total day and by school meal, and the percent of daily energy and food groups contributed by school meals were computed by analysis of covariance, with BMI, ethnicity, sex, age and poverty level as covariates. Of the 7800 participating children aged 5-18 years in the entire dataset, 448 consumed both SBP-NSLP meals on a weekday. Almost one-half (47%) of the day's energy intake was provided by the two school meals. For the major food groups, the contribution of school meals ranged from between 40.6% for vegetables to 77.1% for milk. Overall, these results provide important information on contribution of the SBP and NSLP meals to low income children's daily dietary intake."

The new meal patterns and nutrition standards that were implemented in the fall of 2012 might improve children's dietary intakes at school as they provide fruit, more vegetables (with specific subgroups required over a week), and whole grains, compared with the previous nutrition standards and meal patterns (Food and Nutrition Service -U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2012). Students have to select at least one serving of a fruit or vegetable for the SBP or NSLP meal to count as a reimbursable meal, under the offer versus serve option, which is optional for elementary schools, but not for middle and high schools (Food and Nutrition Service -U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2012). The opportunity to select more fruit and vegetables at meals may increase student fruit and vegetable consumption. Evaluating the impact of the new school meal patterns on school dietary intakes as well as over 24 h is an important area for future study."

The nutrient composition of specially formulated foods for school meal programs might not have been available in the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (Bowman et al., 2008). In addition, measurement errors are associated with self-reported dietary intake. Only 5.7% of the NHANES child participants consumed both a school breakfast and lunch on the recall day and 57% were male, reducing generalizability. Strengths of this study include the use of the nationally representative NHANES study data and dietary intake collected with the multiple pass method.",

These meals serve as a nutrition safety net for low income children; the school lunch program is the second largest food assistance program in the US (Congressional Budget Office, 2015; Government Accountability Office, 2014). Research assessing the impact of the federal meals program on children's dietary intake should continue. Similar analyses could be undertaken with future NHANES data collected after the new school meal rules were implemented in the fall of 2012."
