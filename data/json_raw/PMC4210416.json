[Subjects] Ten healthy young subjects performed the STSE. [Methods] In the STSE, subjects stood up and sat down without using their arms to push-off from the chair at standing up frequencies of 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 times per minutes. Subjects exercised for 5 minutes at each frequency with 5 minutes of rest between each consecutive frequency trial. The steady state of VO 2 was evaluated by the difference in the VO 2 between the 3rd and 5th min at each frequency. The correlation between the VO 2 of the STSE and the standing up frequency was analyzed. [Results] At standing up frequencies greater than 24 times/min, the steady state of VO 2 could not be confirmed. The relationship between the standing up frequency (at less than 24 times/min) and VO 2 was strong (r=0.94). [Conclusion] The STSE may be a potentially useful test for determining AT and predicting the physical capacity of patients."

Physical capacity, such as maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) and anaerobic threshold (AT), is measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) using a cycle ergometer, and treadmill, or field tests such as the incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT) [2][3][4][5] . Laboratory assessment, such as CPX, is not widely available and is expensive. Furthermore, it may not be suitable for patients who cannot pedal or walk. Although the ISWT, which is a simple test and easily conducted, is often employed in clinical practice, it requires a large space and cannot be conducted with patients who cannot walk safely 4,5) .",

There were no subjects who corresponded to the criteria for the premature suspension of the test at standing up frequencies up to 18 times/min. However, the steady state of VO 2 could not be confirmed for some subjects at 3 frequencies as follows: at 24 times/min (2 subjects out of 10), 30 times/min (6 subjects out of remaining 8), 36 times/min (2 subjects out of remaining 2). Therefore, the eight subjects who had completed at least 24 times/min were included in the analysis. The relationship between the standing up frequency and VO 2 was strong (r=0.94, p<0.05).

            "text": "We demonstrated that the STSE workload at standing up frequencies from 24 times/min to 36 times/min was above the AT. In general, a steady state of VO 2 cannot be reached at the workloads above the AT 11) . Therefore, in our study, the steady state of VO 2 could not be verified at the workloads during standing up frequencies from 24 times/min to 36 times/min. Kamimura 6) estimated that the standing up frequency of a work load, equal to the AT determined by cycle ergometer, was within the range from 24 times/min to 30 times/min, and the results of our study lend support to Kamimura's report 6) . This may be related to the resemblance of the exercise pattern, since both STSE and cycle ergometers used similar lower limb muscles and rhythmic motion [13][14][15] . This study demonstrated the relationship between VO 2 and standing up frequency was strong, and VO 2 increased linearly with increase in standing up frequency. It is possible that the total muscle mass involved in the STSE increases as the speed of standing up also increases, and a response from the cardiovascular-respiratory system is elicited by the increase in the total muscle mass 13) . However, Shiomi 7) indicated VO 2 increases in a logarithmically function with increase in standing up frequency. The difference between the two study methods is the setting of the height of the chair. In Shiomi's report 7) , the height of the chair was set at just 41 cm, which is lower than that used in our study. A lower height of chair requires greater muscle activities in the legs, and causes greater fatigue in the leg muscles 14) . This fatigue may cause an inability to elicit a greater response from the cardiovascular-respiratory system. Thus, the setting height of the chair is important for a linear increase in VO 2 , and the setting in our study appears to be adequate.",

In the STSE, elderly people may not be able to maintain the required speed when the activity at high frequencies is faster (e.g. greater than 24 times/min).
