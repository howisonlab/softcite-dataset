This process, which has been termed cancer immunosurveillance, has gained considerable attention in the last years. One of the most important immune effector cells are macrophages, which exert multiple biological roles, including antigen presentation as well as the regulation of inflammation and tissue remodeling. Moreover, macrophages are involved in the etiology of a variety of pathological conditions including cancer. In particular, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been found to contribute to tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. TAMs have been proposed to exhibit many similarities in terms of gene expression and functions with \"alternativelyactivated\" M2 macrophages. 1 Macrophages are classified in two different polarization phenotypes according to distinct functional properties:",

We have previously demonstrated that aRF deficiency severely impairs inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo, establishing a role for aRF in the regulation of innate immunity. The aim of the present work was to get further insights into the immune functions of aRF and to evaluate its possible contribution to the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 or M2 phenotype. Our results demonstrate that resting arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages express high levels of Ym1 and Fizz-1, two typical markers of alternatively-activated macrophages (M2). additionally, arf \u2212/\u2212 peritoneal macrophages showed an impaired response to lipopolysaccharide (a classical inducer of M1 polaryzation) and a reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Moreover, upon stimulation with interleukin-4 (IL-4), an inducer of the M2 phenotype, well established M2 markers such as Fizz-1, Ym1 and arginase-1 were upregulated in arf \u2212/\u2212 as compared with wild type macrophages. accordingly, the cytokine and chemokine profile associated with the M2 phenotype was significantly overexpressed in arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages responding to IL-4. In addition, multiple pro-angiogenic factors such as VeGF and MMp-9 were also increased. In summary, these results indicate that aRF contributes to the polarization and functional plasticity of macrophages.",

These macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12 or IL-23, as well as other pro-inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO, upon the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, iNOS), all of which are essential for killing pathogens and for priming antitumor immune responses. 2 In contrast, IL-4/IL-13 stimulation induces M2 macrophages, which have an important role in the response to parasites, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis and tumor progression. M2 macrophages downregulate IL-12 expression and produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Additionally, M2 macrophages are characterized by the expression of several surface markers including arginase 1 (Arg-1) and the mannose receptor (MMR). [2][3][4] Our results demonstrate that ARF deficiency switch macrophages to a M2-like phenotype. Thus, resting Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages overexpress typical M2 markers such as Ym1 and Fizz-1, as well as the Ccl17 chemokine. Furthermore, compared to their wild type (WT) counterparts, ARF-deficient cells showed an altered expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines such as NO, IL-12, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 after stimulation with LPS.

IL-4 and IL-13 are prototypic cytokines that induce the alternative activation of macrophages. To ascertain the role of ARF in this pathway, we evaluated the M2-like response on WT and Arf \u2212/\u2212 peritoneal macrophages generated upon stimulation with IL-4 or IL-13. As shown in Figure 4A, LPS or IFN\u03b3 treatment induced NO release, a marker for classical activation, whereas IL-4 or IL-13 did not affect the levels of this pro-inflammatory mediator. Consistently with these findings, neither iNOS nor COX-2 overexpression was observed in macrophages activated with IL-4 or IL-13 ( Fig. 4C). Opposite to the NO release observed by M1-activated macrophages, the alternative polarization is characterized by the upregulation of Arg-1, an inducible enzyme that competes with iNOS for l-arginine and thus can prevent NO release. 8 Classical activation of macrophages with LPS had no effect on Arg-1 activation (Fig. 4D). In contrast, IL-4 promoted a > 50-fold induction in Arg-1 expression in WT macrophages (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages showed a much more striking and significant increase of Arg-1 after IL-4 stimulation (Fig. 4D). The markedly raised mRNA levels for Arg-1 in Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages were confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 4E). Moreover, an increment in arginase matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) were increased in ARFdeficient macrophages, suggesting that these cells may exert protumorigenic functions.",

Arg-1 also showed a tendency to be overexpressed, although the data were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, MMR gene was unaffected in this situation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, M1 polarization markers such as iNOS, COX-2, IL-6 or TNF\u03b1 were not altered in Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages. In addition to the modulation of surface markers expression, M1 and M2 macrophages display different cytokines and chemokines gene expression profiles. In order to analyze whether ARF deficiency alters these profiles, we performed a microarray analysis of 84 genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. The full list of genes and fold changes are shown in Table S1. As depicted in Table 1, ARF appears to play a key role in regulating the basal expression of several genes related with M2 polarization. Thus, in the group of genes upregulated in Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages, we found Ccl12 and Ccl17, two chemokines related to the M2 phenotype. In contrast, the expression of M1-related chemokines (Ccl2 and Cxcl10) was reduced. Microarray data were validated by quantitative PCR (Fig. 1C).

One of the characteristics of M2-polarized cells is their ability to wane the inflammatory/immune response by inhibiting M1 macrophage-mediated functions. M1 macrophages are mainly induced by IFN\u03b3 or upon stimulation with bacterial products such as LPS. To investigate whether ARF deficiency contributes to the downregulation of M1-mediated inflammatory activities, we examined the levels of classical inflammatory mediators such as NO and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ). Peritoneal macrophages from WT and Arf \u2212/\u2212 mice were stimulated with LPS or IFN\u03b3. As expected, the stimulation of WT macrophages with LPS generated high NO and PGE 2 levels, whereas a deficient response was observed in the absence of Arf ( Fig. 2A and B). Accordingly, iNOS and COX-2 expression was upregulated in WT cells responding to LPS and IFN\u03b3, as compared with Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages ( Fig. 2C and D). Similar to LPS, IFN\u03b3 induced NO release and iNOS activation, and once again, Arf \u2212/\u2212 cells showed a significantly reduced response as compared with WT macrophages ( Fig. 2E-G). treatment (Figs. 5D and E), suggesting a pro-tumoral function for these cells.",

Moreover, macrophages are increasingly recognized as pivotal regulators of tumorigenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests that macrophages that infiltrate tumors acquire a phenotype of alternative activation (M2), exerting immunosuppressive functions through the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines and facilitating the progression of tumors via the production of proangiogenic factors. 1 Previously, we have described that the tumor suppressor ARF is an important mediator of the inflammatory response and of macrophage activation. 7 In the current study, we investigated whether ARF deficiency promotes macrophage differentiation toward a phenotype that resembles the alternatively-activated Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages. In primary macrophages stimulated with LPS or IFN\u03b3, these included genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), chemokines (Cxcl10, Cxcl1, Ccl4) and inflammatory mediators (iNOS/PGE 2 ). Accordingly, the absence of Arf is known to reduce the susceptibility of mice to septic shock. 7 Although mechanisms involved in this inhibitory effect have not been explored in this study, a decrease in NF\u03baB and MAPK activation has been described in Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages responding to LPS. 7 Similarly, inhibited degradation of I\u03baB has been observed in ARF-deficient macrophages stimulated with the vesicular stomatis virus. 12 Interestingly, the nuclear translocation of the p65/p50 heterodimers mainly associated with classical NF\u03baB activation was also inhibited in macrophages from Arf \u2212/\u2212 mice responding to LPS stimulation, 7 whereas massive accumulation of the p50 homodimer was observed (unpublished results), supporting the idea that ARF deficiency favors M2-driven inflammatory reactions.",

In mice, M2 macrophages are characterized by an alternative metabolism of l-arginine, mainly catalyzed by Arg-1. Arg-1 is a cytosolic enzyme expressed at high levels in M2 macrophages that hydrolyzes Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages, we hypothesized that ARF might modulate the M1/M2 polarization and functional plasticity of macrophages. We have demonstrated that genes involved in M1 polarization, antimicrobial and antitumoral responses are downregulated in  studies showing a direct correlation between the M2 phenotype and a elevated expression of these genes. 5 Interestingly, Fizz-1 and Ym1 have been shown to exert angiogenic effects, stimulating actin and collagen expression, and have been implicated in tissue repair. 18,19 M2 macrophages and TAMs play an important role in tumor angiogenesis, as they produce critical factors including VEGF and MMP-9. 20 Our results demonstrate that Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages produce high levels of these angiogenesis-associated molecules, supporting the idea of that these cells exert tumor-supporting functions. Consistent with this notion, recent studies have demonstrated a role for ARF in suppressing tumor angiogenesis by arginine to urea and ornithine. 8 Elevated Arg-1 expression might promote tumor growth via several mechanisms, including the downregulation of NO-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, 13 increased tumor proliferation (due to alterations in polyamine and proline synthesis), and enhancements of the capacity of myeloidderived suppressor cells to inhibit T cell proliferation. 14,15 Indeed, increased expression of Arg-1 in TAMs has been described in 3LL murine lung carcinoma, 14 in human papillomavirus E6/ E7-expressing murine tumors 16 and in CD11b + /CD14 \u2212 myeloid cells from renal carcinoma patients. 17 Together with Arg-1 overexpression, an increase in Fizz-1 and Ym1 levels was observed in Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages.

Moreover, Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages showed a significant increase in IL-10 levels, which contribute to the maintenance of an immunosuppressive environment. Taken together, these findings indicate that resting Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages acquire an M2-like phenotype. Moreover, Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages exhibit a higher expression of M2-associated immunomodulatory genes in response to alternative activation stimuli.",

            "text": "In summary, we propose that ARF-deficient macrophages can contribute to the establishment of a tolerogenic microenviroment, faciliting tumor progression as a result of (1) immunosuppression, through the production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and the secretion of Ccl22 and Ccl2, which attract Tregs, (2) stimulation of angiogenesis, through the upregulation of VEGF and MMP-9, and (3) induction of extracellular matrix remodeling, through the production of MMP-9, Fizz-1 and Ym1 (Fig. 7). Further experiments analyzing the phenotype of macrophages that regulating the expression of VEGF 21 and the activity of its transactivator hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). 22 Notably, ARF has also been described to inhibit angiogenesis by upregulating the expression of TIMP3, an inhibitor of MMPs activity. 23 Another important feature that discriminates M1 and M2 macrophages is their cytokine and chemokine repertoire. M1 macrophages produce inflammatory chemokines such as Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, which induce the recruitment of Th1 cells, whereas M2 polarization is accompanied by the production of immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., IL-10 and TGF\u03b2) and chemokines such as Ccl17, Ccl22 and Ccl24 1,4,24 that favor the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells such like regulatory T cells (Tregs). Analysis of the cytokine and chemokine profile in Arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages showed a clear correlation with M2 phenotype. Notably, chemokines typically involved in lymphocyte recruitment, such as Ccl5 and the Ccr4 ligands Ccl17 and Ccl22 were consistently higher after the administration of IL-4 treatment in Arf \u2212/\u2212 , but not in WT, macrophages. Thus, the release of these chemokines Figure 5. M2 phenotype markers and pro-angiogenic factors are increased in IL-4-treated arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages. (A) peritoneal macrophages from WT and aRF-deficient mice were treated with 20 ng/mL IL-4 for 6 h, and the expression of IL-10 was evaluated by quantitative pcR. (B) IL-10 levels were measured by eLIsa in supernatants of WT and arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages treated for 24 h with 20 ng/mL IL-4. (C) WT and arf \u2212/\u2212 macrophages were treated as in a and Fizz-1, Ym1 and MMR expression was examined by quantitative pcR. (D) VeGF and MMp-9 expression was examined by quantitative pcR in WT and arf \u2212/\u2212 cells upon stimulation with 20 ng/mL IL-4 for 6 h. (E) VeGF levels were determined by eLIsa after stimulation of WT and arf \u2212/\u2212 cells with 20 ng/mL IL-4 for 24 h.
