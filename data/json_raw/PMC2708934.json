            "text": "The IKK [I\u03baB (inhibitory \u03baB) kinase] complex is a key regulatory component of NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor \u03baB) activation and is responsible for mediating the degradation of I\u03baB, thereby allowing nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB and transcription of target genes. NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator), the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, plays a pivotal role in this process by integrating upstream signals, in particular the recognition of polyubiquitin chains, and relaying these to the activation of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, the catalytic subunits of the IKK complex. The oligomeric state of NEMO is controversial and the mechanism by which it regulates activation of the IKK complex is poorly understood. Using a combination of hydrodynamic techniques we now show that apo-NEMO is a highly elongated, dimeric protein that is in weak equilibrium with a tetrameric assembly. Interaction with peptides derived from IKK\u03b2 disrupts formation of the tetrameric NEMO complex, indicating that interaction with IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 and tetramerization are mutually exclusive. Furthermore, we show that NEMO binds to linear di-ubiquitin with a stoichiometry of one molecule of di-ubiquitin per NEMO dimer. This stoichiometry is preserved in a construct comprising the second coiled-coil region and the leucine zipper and in one that essentially spans the full-length protein. However, our data show that at high di-ubiquitin concentrations a second weaker binding site becomes apparent, implying that two different NEMOdi-ubiquitin complexes are formed during the IKK activation process. We propose that the role of these two complexes is to provide a threshold for activation, thereby ensuring sufficient specificity during NF-\u03baB signalling.

            "text": "NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor \u03baB) transcription factors are key regulators of immune and inflammatory responses (reviewed in [1,2]). In unstimulated cells they are found in complex with I\u03baB (inhibitory \u03baB) proteins, an interaction that prevents their translocation to the nucleus and retains NF-\u03baBs in the cytosol. Stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of I\u03baBs induces their Lys 48 -linked ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome, thereby liberating NF-\u03baB and allowing nuclear translocation. A key regulator of this process is the multi-subunit IKK (I\u03baB kinase) complex (sometimes referred to as the signalosome), which is composed of two kinases, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, and a non-catalytic regulatory subunit called IKK\u03b3 or NEMO (NF-\u03baB essential modulator) [3][4][5]. The apparent molecular mass of the resting IKK complex has been shown to be in the 700-900 kDa range, suggesting that it may contain multiple copies of its constituents [6][7][8]. Nonetheless, its precise composition is controversial, and it may be that its size varies in a stimulus-dependent manner [9]. NEMO is the regulatory hub of the IKK complex and integrates multiple signals, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and interaction with ubiquitin chains [10]. In addition to being the target of multiple post-translational modifications, NEMO also acts as an assembly platform that facilitates the incorporation of a variety of proteins into the IKK signalosome, such as the viral proteins vFLIP {viral FLICE [FADD (Fas-associated death domain)-like interleukin 1\u03b2-converting enzyme]-inhibitory protein} and Tax, which can act as potent activators of NF-\u03baB [11,12].",

            "text": "NEMO is a \u223c 50 kDa protein predicted to consist of two coiledcoil regions, CC1 and CC2, a LZ (leucine zipper) and a ZF (zinc finger) ( Figure 1). In spite of extensive studies aimed at defining the assembly of NEMO, its oligomeric state still remains a matter of some controversy. The apo form of the full-length protein has variously been described as monomeric, dimeric, trimeric or tetrameric state [13][14][15]. A number of studies have suggested that the second coiled-coil region, together with the LZ, constitutes the minimal oligomerization domain (from now on referred to as CoZi) [15,16]. However, similar to the full-length protein, the oligomeric state of this region is not clear and has, for example, been described as a trimer that can associate to 'pseudo-hexamers' upon appropriate stimulation [16]. In contrast, two recent crystal structures of this region have shown it forms a parallel, dimeric coiled-coil, in accordance with other studies that reported a dimeric assembly [15,[17][18][19]. The oligomeric state of the N-terminal coiled-coil region is similarly unresolved, and a range of oligomeric states have been reported [20][21][22].",

            "text": "A key step towards a better understanding of the regulatory role of NEMO in NF-\u03baB activation was the observation that NEMO interacts specifically with polyubiquitin chains ( [23], but see [23a], [24]). These experiments initially utilized linear ('genetically linked', i.e. Gly 76 to Met 1 linked) polyubiquitin chains in a yeast two-hybrid screen. However, Lys 63 -linked ubiquitin chains attached to RIP1 (receptor interaction protein kinase) are believed to be the physiological targets ( [23], but see [23a]). This interaction is suggested to recruit the IKK complex to receptor complexes and thereby promote the subsequent activation of the kinase activity of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2. The binding site for ubiquitin has been mapped to a region of NEMO that has homology with ABIN (A20-binding inhibitor of NF-\u03baB) and optineurin and has been named the NUB or UBAN motif ( [23], but see [23a], [24,25]). This conserved binding region is located within the CoZi domain. Although a number of studies have shown that specific recognition of K63-linked ubiquitin chains is important for NF-\u03baB activation ( [23], but see [23a], [24]), it has recently been reported that linear di-ubiquitin binds with a 100-fold higher affinity to the CoZi domain than K63-linked di-ubiquitin [17,18,26]. This observation is particularly interesting in the light of a recent report that NEMO itself becomes modified with linear ubiquitin chains that are attached by the ligase complex LUBAC [27].",

            "text": "In the present study we have applied a combination of complementary hydrodynamic methods to define the oligomeric state of NEMO and resolve the current controversy surrounding its self-association. We show that apo-NEMO forms a tight dimer that is in a relatively weak equilibrium with a tetrameric assembly. Importantly, binding of IKK\u03b2-derived peptides prevented formation of the tetramer, indicating that the IKK-binding region in the N-terminal portion of NEMO is responsible for the formation of higher-molecular-mass species and that IKK binding and tetramerization are mutually exclusive. Furthermore, we show that the CoZi domain and a nearly full-length NEMO construct bind di-ubiquitin with similar affinities but slightly different energetics. These results suggest that no major conformational changes take place upon interaction with ubiquitin chains, but that minor rearrangements may be induced in the N-terminal coiledcoil region. Surprisingly, only one di-ubiquitin chain binds to the symmetrical NEMO dimer. However, a second binding site becomes apparent at high ubiquitin concentrations, implying that two different NEMO/polyubiquitin complexes are formed during the activation process. This observation may have implications for the in vivo function of NEMO and suggests that association with protein assemblies that provide a high density of polyubiquitin chains might induce clustering of NEMO, which in turn will lead to activation of the IKK complex."

This construct is missing only the C-terminal ZF, which has been shown to be monomeric [28] and will be referred to from now on as NEMO 355 ( Figure 1). SEC-MALS allows the determination of an absolute molecular mass during analytical gel filtration, independent of the shape of the molecule under investigation, and hence is well suited to determine the oligomeric state of proteins. An initial MALS experiment reports a weightaveraged molecular mass (M W ) of 85.7 kDa for an average peak concentration of 1.4 \u03bcM, a value in close agreement with the formula molecular mass of dimeric NEMO 355 (83.8 kDa). However, at increased concentrations, elevated M W values are apparent, a phenomenon that was unaffected when the NaCl concentration was increased to 500 mM (results not shown). We therefore analysed the concentration-dependent M W of NEMO 355 further with a sequence of SEC-MALS analyses ranging from 1.4 to 16.9 \u03bcM (average peak concentration), as shown in Figure 2. These experiments reported corresponding M W values of 85.7-113.8 kDa and clearly demonstrate that NEMO 355 is subject to concentration-dependent self-association based upon a minimum assembling unit equivalent to a dimer. The assembly of dimers into tetramers is the simplest model explaining these data.",

No binding was detected between the CoZi domain and mono-ubiquitin at three different temperatures at concentrations of 50 \u03bcM CoZi in the cell and 500 \u03bcM ubiquitin in the syringe, indicating that any interaction must be very weak (results not shown). Titration of CoZi with increasing concentrations of di-ubiquitin at 18 \u2022 C resulted in heats of interaction that were too small for quantitative analysis. However, titrations at 25 \u2022 C and 10 \u2022 C produced sufficient signal to be able to fit the binding isotherm, resulting in dissociation constants of 1.4 and 2.6 \u03bcM respectively (see Table 2 and Figure 4A). Surprisingly, the stoichiometry of complex formation was \u223c 0.5 in terms of polypeptide chains, demonstrating that one CoZi dimer interacts with one molecule of di-ubiquitin. Given the pseudosymmetrical structure of dimeric CoZi [17,18], one might expect that equivalent binding sites on each NEMO chain exist, and hence that two molecules of di-ubiquitin would bind, one either side (CoZi dimer /2 \u00d7 di-ubiquitin  Figure 4C).

Multiple experiments were performed in which molar ratios of CoZi dimer and di-ubiquitin were varied (1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8; CoZi dimer /diubiquitin). Molar concentrations and the resulting hydrodynamic data from these experiments are detailed in Table 3.

The smallest component in each experiment clearly represents free diubiquitin, as the s 20,w D t,20,w and M W values closely correspond to the values obtained from analysis of di-ubiquitin alone (Table 3). In the 1:1 experiment, the largest and most abundant component has a mass of 45.3 kDa, close to the predicted molecular mass of a complex consisting of dimeric CoZi bound to one di-ubiquitin chain (CoZi dimer -di-ubiquitin = 43.5 kDa).

A large proportion of the protein is predicted to form coiled coils, including the regions that are involved in ubiquitin recognition and interaction with the catalytic IKK subunits. The molecular mechanism by which NEMO induces activation of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 remains largely unknown, although various models have been suggested. One model assumes the CoZi domain undergoes stimulus-dependent conformational changes that in turn might induce activation of the kinases [19]. Alternatively, NEMO might act as a carrier or platform that is responsible for bringing IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 in close proximity to activators such as TAK1 [TGF\u03b2 (transforming growth factor \u03b2)-activated kinase-1] to promote phosphorylation and activation ( [23], but see [23a], [24]). On the other hand, the interaction with ubiquitin chains may induce clustering of NEMO, which could lead to IKK activation, possibly by inducing transphosphorylation.",

Using a combination of MALS and AUC, we show that NEMO forms a very tight dimer that exists in a relatively weak equilibrium (\u223c 27 \u03bcM) with tetramers. Importantly, our extensive analysis shows that the protein preparations used in our study are homogeneous and monodisperse, and that no aggregates are present that may interfere with the measurements. Our results partially agree with a previous study that described human NEMO to predominantly form tetramers [15], but contradict a number of others that described NEMO as monomers and trimers [13,14,16]. The most likely explanation for this discrepancy is the presence of detergent in the work by Agou and co-workers, which was, apparently, required to prevent the formation of aggregates, suggesting that the protein used in those studies may not have been in its native conformation [13,14,16]. This interpretation is supported by the presence of chaperone protein DnaK in the protein preparations used for some of the studies. Furthermore, we believe that the various and highly contradicting oligomeric states determined for different N-terminal constructs of NEMO [20,21] are due to an inherent instability and heterogeneity of shorter NEMO fragments, which may have compromised previous work. This interpretation is supported by Rushe et al. [29] who reported a similar lack of homogeneity for shorter N-terminal fragments of NEMO.",

Furthermore, complex formation with an IKK\u03b2-derived peptide completely abolished the ability of dimeric NEMO 355 to form higher-order oligomers, showing that the region surrounding the IKK-binding site is responsible for tetramerization. These results from the present study are in contrast with those of previous cross-linking studies, which suggested that NEMO binds the IKKs in its tetrameric form and that tetramerization is required for kinase activity [15]. It now seems likely that cross-linking studies have overestimated the oligomeric state of NEMO due to non-specific association. Nevertheless, the model that oligomerization of NEMO might be part of the IKK activation mechanism is intriguing and is fully compatible with the notion that binding to polyubiquitin chains induces clustering of NEMO as described below. Importantly, the observation that interaction with IKK abolishes tetramerization clearly illustrates that the oligomeric state of NEMO in its ligand complexes might differ from that of the apoprotein.",

This is in accordance with the results reported here, yet contradicts a number of other studies that reported trimeric and hexameric assemblies [13,16]. A CoZi construct comprising amino acids 250-339 has been reported to exist in a monomer-dimer equilibrium with a K d of 30 \u03bcM [19]. The fragment used in the present study is slightly extended at the C-terminus and includes amino acids 340-355, which are not predicted to be part of the LZ. Interestingly, the inclusion of this region significantly strengthens dimerization, suggesting that this C-terminal extension, which is absent in the crystallised fragments, is part of the coiled-coil domain.",

These values are significantly higher than would be expected for a globular protein and are in fact similar to the value measured for fibrinogen (2.3), a rod-like protein that has been shown by electron microscopy to have an average axial ratio (length divided by diameter) of 7.5 [32][33][34]. The recently reported structures of NEMO 44\u2212111 bound to IKK-derived peptides [29] and NEMO 150\u2212272 bound to vFLIP [35] show the respective ligandbound fragments of NEMO form an elongated dimeric coiledcoil. In combination with our AUC studies, these observations indicate that binding of target proteins will not induce gross conformational changes, but can alter oligomerization. Instead, apo-NEMO forms a highly elongated coiled-coil that is poised to accommodate the binding of different proteins, apparently without major structural rearrangements. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that binding to ligands may induce slight local changes that are propagated along the coiled-coil, ultimately inducing activation of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2.",

Binding occurs via the UBAN motif within the CoZi domain. The interaction of monoubiquitin with CoZi is extremely weak, and we could not detect any binding under the conditions of our ITC experiments, although high sensitivity LUMIER (LUminescence-based Mammalian IntERactome) assays showed weak binding can occur [19]. In contrast, linear di-ubiquitin binds with an affinity in the low-micromolar range, clearly indicating that the interaction with each individual ubiquitin is additive. Unexpectedly, binding of NEMO to K63-linked di-ubiquitin is significantly weaker than to linear chains [17,18,26], suggesting that linear polyubiquitin chains may be the true physiological targets [18].",

This stoichiometry is in accordance with an independent study by Lo et al. [17] that also detected a 2:1 complex in solution. On the basis of NMR chemical shift perturbations and mutagenesis studies, these authors suggested a model for the complex in which diubiquitin clasps around dimeric NEMO roughly perpendicular to the long axis of the NEMO coiled-coil domain. However, this stoichiometry and the derived model strongly contradict the recently published CoZi/di-ubiquitin structure, which instead shows two molecules of di-ubiquitin to bind to a NEMO dimer in an orientation that is parallel with the coiled-coil axis [18]. Moreover, the authors of this study present NF-\u03baB activation assays with NEMO mutants defective in ubiquitin binding, which support the notion that binding of two di-ubiquitin molecules to NEMO is physiologically important. A simple explanation for the apparent discrepancy between these studies could be the partial dissociation of CoZi in the solution studies. However, this explanation seems highly unlikely, as our AUC sedimentation analysis of CoZi at concentrations used in the ITC experiments shows that CoZi exists entirely in its dimeric form.",

Sedimentation velocity experiments, at equimolar concentrations of CoZi dimers and di-ubiquitin, showed a complex of the molecular mass expected from the stoichiometry observed in our ITC studies. Intriguingly, however, increases in the relative ratio of di-ubiquitin over CoZi led to an increase in the apparent molecular mass of the complex, suggesting that at higher concentrations of di-ubiquitin a second binding site in NEMO becomes occupied. Affinity for this second site is significantly weaker, and thus it is possible that binding of the first molecule of di-ubiquitin may occlude binding of a second. However, high ubiquitin concentrations might induce slight structural rearrangements in NEMO, which in turn allow the second binding site to become accessible. Alternatively, apo-NEMO might exist in an equilibrium between two states, of which only one may be capable of binding two di-ubiquitin chains. This state might be unfavourable and hence would only be occupied at high ubiquitin concentrations. However, crystallization conditions might have selected for this state over the other."

In fact, this two-site binding event might constitute a 'threshold for activation' to prevent non-specific activation of NF-\u03baB, which can have detrimental consequences for the host.
