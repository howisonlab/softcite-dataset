The purpose of our study was to determine whether metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular risk factors (hyperuricaemia and smoking) are associated with the progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Methods. Two hundred and twenty three IgAN patients (107 with and 116 without metabolic syndrome) were examined. The primary renal end point was doubling of serum creatinine; secondary end points were reaching eGFR of \u2264 60 ml/min/1,73m 2 or eGFR of \u226430 ml/min/1.73 m 2 , and end-stage renal disease, ESRD (the composite of serum creatinine \u2265500 \u00b5mol/l, initiation of dialysis treatment or transplantation). The association of metabolic syndrome with renal end points was examined using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox models. Results. Metabolic syndrome established at the diagnosis or during follow-up of IgAN patients was significantly associated with the primary renal end point (unadjusted hazard ratio of doubling of serum creatinine, 95% confidence interval: 1.96 (1.17-1.33, p = 0.011). The association remained significant after adjustment for confounders: 1.70 (1.02-3.83, p = 0.040). Results were similar for secondary end points except ESRD which was not associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome. Hyperuricaemia and smoking were independent risk factors of progression. Survival curves stratified on metabolic syndrome status showed significant differences for the end points (p = 0.017-0.001) except for ESRD. Conclusions. Early diagnosis and treatment of metabolic syndrome, hyperuricaemia and smoking may be an additional cost-effective strategy for preventing the progression of IgAN."

Other cross-sectional studies have also demonstrated a link between metabolic syndrome and CKD (see later). In the only longitudinal study, Kurella et al.

            "text": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis and is an important cause of endstage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide [5]. Long-term observation in many countries has shown that IgAN causes ESRD in as many as 40% of patients within 20 years after diagnosis [6,7]. Clinical presentation is usually with haematuria and with variable degrees of proteinuria. Pathologically, IgAN is characterized by the glomerular deposition of polymeric IgA1 mainly in the mesangium accompanied by mesangial hypercellularity, mesangial matrix expansion, and varying degrees of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Adverse prognostic indicators include the presence of heavy proteinuria and hypertension, a significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the time of renal biopsy and the extent of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis on renal pathology [7,8]. In addition to these known risk factors, other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperuricaemia, excessive body weight or cigarette smoking have also been associated with the progression of IgAN in recent studies [9][10][11]. However, there are no data about the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in IgAN patients, and there have not been any reports of an association between metabolic syndrome and the progression of IgAN.",

            "text": "The criteria for metabolic syndrome diagnosis were set-up originally to identify those individuals most likely to develop cardiovascular diseases [15]. There is no doubt nowadays that the patients with metabolic syndrome are at significantly higher risk for CKD too, as summarized by a number of review articles and by the recent meta-analysis of Thomas et al. [16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Most of the observational studies discussed in these papers found a significant association between metabolic syndrome and CKD. The odds ratios for CKD in the different studies were: 2.60 in the National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III) database [3]  [31] in Chinese adults as well as 1.30 in non-diabetic Taiwanese adults [32]. However, the majority of the studies were cross-sectional and, as such, unable to establish a cause-effect relationship between metabolic syndrome and the reduction in kidney function, and also unable to determine if metabolic syndrome is associated with longitudinal changes in kidney function. In this study, we detected a significant association between metabolic syndrome and the progressive loss of kidney function except in ESRD, suggesting a potential effect of metabolic syndrome on the early progression of IgAN. The lower eGFR level of patients with metabolic syndrome seen at the time of diagnosis of IgAN suggests a potential effect of metabolic syndrome on the incidence of the renal disease too. Our observation that metabolic syndrome did not associate with the progression of IgAN in the end-stage of IgAN is in agreement with the results of the study of Lee et al. [33] on CKD patients participating in the CKD prevention programme regulated by the Public Health Bureau of Taiwan. Among the components of metabolic syndrome, diabetic and hypertensive injuries, the two major aetiologies of CKD worldwide, have been well studied and described. Concerning the association between IgAN and diabetes, Fliser et al. [34] published that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia are already present in patients with incipient renal disease, among others in IgAN patients. In our present study, we found impaired glucose regulation (IGT, IFG or diabetes mellitus) in 77 (35%) patients. It is known that IgAN can also be superimposed on diabetic nephropathy or can be the only renal abnormality of diabetic patients. The association between IgAN and diabetes may not be coincidental, because the intraglomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration as well as biochemical alterations in the glomeruli of diabetic patients may facilitate the deposition of IgA1 immune complexes or aggregates. Furthermore, the abnormalities of the IgA immune system are common in Type 2 diabetes [35].",

            "text": "There is a close connection between hypertension and hyperuricaemia and at the re-evaluation of metabolic syndrome; Reaven [15] suggested to include hyperuricaemia among the criteria of metabolic syndrome. In the only previous study on IgAN patients, hyperuricaemia was found to be a predictor of poor prognosis similarly to our investigation [10]. An association between smoking and CKD has been found in various studies, including in lupus patients, polycystic kidney disease, primary glomerular diseases and diabetic nephropathy [49][50][51][52]. In the present study, smoking was significantly associated with the progression to ESRD, similar to the study by Yamamoto et al. [11] who, however, examined the smoking status only at time of diagnosis of IgAN.",

            "text": "Our study is notable for the well-characterized nature of the study population and the long follow-up of the patients by the same two nephrologists. Our study also has a number of limitations that have to be considered when interpreting the findings. This was a single-centre study hence the external validity of our findings may be limited. We lacked measurements of waist circumference as a better measure of abdominal obesity. Instead, we used BMI which is an acceptable alternative used in the World Health Organization classification of metabolic syndrome. This modification of the NCEP ATP III classification of metabolic syndrome we used was also used by Lea et al. examining the metabolic syndrome and the risk of progressive CKD in hypertensive African Americans [27]. Our study did not involve and discuss proteinuria as a predictor of the progression of CKD, because proteinuria could be a clinical characteristic of IgAN and also a consequence of metabolic syndrome. This is the first study describing the frequent prevalence of metabolic syndrome at the time of diagnosis and during the follow-up of IgAN patients, and supporting the role of metabolic syndrome in the progression of IgAN. Hyperuricaemia and smoking seem to also be important risk factors of progression in IgAN. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and treatment of metabolic syndrome and hyperuricaemia, and cessation of smoking could be an added beneficial cost-effective strategy in the prevention of the progression of IgAN and in the prevention of the development of cardiovascular diseases, on the basis of the close connection between the progression of CKD and cardiovascular diseases.
