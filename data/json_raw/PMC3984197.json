Material and Methods: Twentyseven Wistar rats were submitted to coronal opening of their mandibular right first molars. They were radiographed at 2, 15 and 30 days after the operative procedure by two digital radiographic storage phosphor plates (Digora \u00ae). The images were analyzed by creating a region of interest at the periapical region of each tooth (ImageJ) and registering the corresponding pixel values. After the sacrifice, the specimens were submitted to microscopic analysis in order to confirm the pulpal and periapical status of the tooth. Results: There was significant statistically difference between the control and test sides in all the experimental periods regarding the pixel values (two-way ANOVA; p<0.05). Conclusions: The microscopic analysis proved that a periapical disease development occurred during the experimental periods with an evolution from pulpal necrosis to periapical bone resorption.",

Studies have suggested that pathologic involvement of the cortical plate, or at least junctional trabeculae, is a prerequisite for radiographic detection of periapical pathoses 16 . Nevertheless, periapical lesions confined to cancellous bone could be detected radiographically using pixel values using one of the tools of the digital image, the histogram 2 . Only a few studies employing animal models 3,7,8 or human biopsies 10,21,23 have compared the diagnostic and quantifying accuracy of radiographs to the gold standard represented by the histology. The aim of this study was to induce periapical disease in rats to assess the pixel values in different experimental periods to evaluate the bone loss progression.  6 . The animals were submitted to general intramuscular anesthesia. In each animal, a cavity was made on the occlusal face of the mandibular first molar on the right side with a spherical burr size \u00bc, at high speed without cooling 28 . The left side was set as control.",

These studies showed that it is possible to detect bone loss in the mandibular region by analyzing the pixel value, even if it is not yet visible radiographically. Conversely, studies that compared images obtained by conventional radiographs (without pixel value analysis) and bone resorption seen microscopically, showed that this relationship is not established with precision 4,14, De Rossi, et al. 9 (2007) concluded that although image digitization could not improve the detection of the early stages of periapical lesions, it provides valuable quantitative assessment of extensive periapical lesions.",

The means of the pixel values in the areas of periapical disease induced in rats indicated greater bone resorption than the means of these values on the control side for the three experimental periods (p<0.05). even small periapical bone resorption was already sufficient for determining changes in the pixel values of that area in the direct digital method, when compared to their respective controls.",
