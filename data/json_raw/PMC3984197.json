Material and Methods: Twentyseven Wistar rats were submitted to coronal opening of their mandibular right first molars. They were radiographed at 2, 15 and 30 days after the operative procedure by two digital radiographic storage phosphor plates (Digora \u00ae). The images were analyzed by creating a region of interest at the periapical region of each tooth (ImageJ) and registering the corresponding pixel values. After the sacrifice, the specimens were submitted to microscopic analysis in order to confirm the pulpal and periapical status of the tooth. Results: There was significant statistically difference between the control and test sides in all the experimental periods regarding the pixel values (two-way ANOVA; p<0.05). Conclusions: The microscopic analysis proved that a periapical disease development occurred during the experimental periods with an evolution from pulpal necrosis to periapical bone resorption."

Studies have suggested that pathologic involvement of the cortical plate, or at least junctional trabeculae, is a prerequisite for radiographic detection of periapical pathoses 16 . Nevertheless, periapical lesions confined to cancellous bone could be detected radiographically using pixel values using one of the tools of the digital image, the histogram 2 . Only a few studies employing animal models 3,7,8 or human biopsies 10,21,23 have compared the diagnostic and quantifying accuracy of radiographs to the gold standard represented by the histology. The aim of this study was to induce periapical disease in rats to assess the pixel values in different experimental periods to evaluate the bone loss progression.  6 . The animals were submitted to general intramuscular anesthesia. In each animal, a cavity was made on the occlusal face of the mandibular first molar on the right side with a spherical burr size \u00bc, at high speed without cooling 28 . The left side was set as control.",

In the test site it was noted whether the tooth had pulpitis, necrosis or presented any sign of inflammation, and whether or not there was presence of periapical bone resorption. The percentages of bone tissue in the apical region of the root, soft tissue (connective tissue and inflammatory infiltrate, when present), bone marrow and inferior alveolar nerve were obtained in a digital image analysis system, composed of a Zeiss Axioskop II microscope, CCD-IRIS RGB -Sony camera (Sony DXC-151A RGB Video Camera-Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and Kontron KS300 \u00ae software (Kontron Electronic GMBM, Munich, Germany). For this purpose, an image was captured at 10x objective from each histologic slice, which contained the apical portion of the mesial root perpendicular to the alveolar nerve, positioned centrally. The studied area was established in numbers of pixels. each image captured had 307,200 pixels and evaluated total area was 1536,000 pixels.

Although the lesion appeared to be stabilized, with diminished bone resorption, new bone formation did not occur due to the presence of aggressive factors 30 .

Teeth with pulpitis microscopically presented periapical bone resorption, but the teeth with necrosis presented greater resorption. The control teeth presented healthy pulp, without signs of periapical bone resorption. The means of the pixel values in the areas of periapical disease induced in rats indicated greater bone resorption than the means of these values on the control side for the three experimental periods (p<0.05). even small periapical bone resorption was already sufficient for determining changes in the pixel values of that area in the direct digital method, when compared to their respective controls."
