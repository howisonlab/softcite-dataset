            "text": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was loaded in hollow microspheres to improve its oral bioavailability. 5-FU hollow microspheres were developed by a solvent diffusion-evaporation method. The effect of Span 80 concentration, ether/ethanol volume ratio, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone/ethyl cellulose weight ratio on physicochemical characteristics, floating, and in vitro release behaviors of 5-FU hollow microspheres was investigated and optimized. The formulation and technology composed of Span 80 (1.5%, w/v), ether/ethanol (1.0:10.0, v/v), and polyvinyl pyrrolidone/ethyl cellulose (1.0:10.0, w/w) were employed to develop three batch samples, which showed an excellent reproducibility. The microspheres were spherical with a hollow structure with high drug loading amount (28.4%\u00b10.5%) and production yield (74.2%\u00b10.6%); they exhibited excellent floating and sustained release characteristics in simulated gastric and intestinal fluid. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that 5-FU hollow microspheres significantly enhanced oral bioavailability (area under curve, [AUC] (0\u2212t) : 12.53\u00b11.65 mg/L*h vs 7.80\u00b10.83 and 5.82\u00b10.83 mg/L*h) with longer elimination half-life (t 1/2) (15.43\u00b12.12 hours vs 2.25\u00b10.22 and 1.43\u00b10.18 hours) and mean residence time (7.65\u00b10.97 hours vs 3.61\u00b10.41 and 2.34\u00b10.35 hours), in comparison with its solid microspheres and powder. In vivo distribution results from tumor-bearing nude mice demonstrated that the animals administered with 5-FU hollow microspheres had much higher drug content in tumor, plasma, and stomach at 1 and 8 hours except for 0.5 hours sample collection time point in comparison with those administered with 5-FU solid microspheres and its powder. These results suggested that the hollow microspheres would be a promising controlled drug delivery system for an oral chemotherapy agent like 5-FU.",

            "text": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) belongs to a family of antimetabolite antitumor drugs and interferes with nucleic acid and DNA synthesis, resulting in cancer cell death. [1][2][3] It is one of the most widely used antitumor drugs for the treatment of several solid tumors such as colorectal, breast, liver, brain, and pancreas cancer, either alone or in combination with other drugs. [4][5][6][7][8][9] Because of the poor absorption of 5-FU from gastrointestinal tract and greatly variable oral bioavailability, it was commonly used intravenously in clinic. Patients have to be continually administered high drug doses because of the short biological half-life (10-20 minutes) of 5-FU. At present, to obtain an ideal therapeutic effect in patients, 5-FU injection is frequently administered every day by intravenous bolus injection for 5 days and this treatment procedure is repeated every 28 days with three cycles. 10 However, intravenous administration is commonly associated with hematological, neural, and cardiac severe systemic adverse effects. Therefore, oral delivery systems containing 5-FU, including gelatin/chitosan microspheres, poly (dl-lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles, alginate-chitosan/montmorillonite nanocomposite systems, and floating microspheres, have been developed in order to improve oral bioavailability with a continuous sustained release behavior. [11][12][13][14] The oral sustained or controlled drug delivery system can release the drug slowly into the gastrointestinal tract and maintain a relative steady blood drug concentration for a longer time. However, such drug delivery systems have been affected by different gastric retention times resulting from gastric emptying. 15 In general, an incomplete release and short residence time of the drug formulation in the upper gastrointestinal tract will result in lower oral bioavailability. Thus, it is particularly important to avoid these problems and prolong the gastric retention time of drug dosage forms, which contribute to retain the sustained or controlled drug delivery in stomach for a longer time and improve oral bioavailability of the drug which is preferentially absorbed in the upper site of the small intestine. During the past decades, many studies concerning the oral sustained or controlled release dosage forms possessing prolonged gastric emptying time have been done, such as bioadhesive systems, swelling type dosage forms, high density drug preparations, and floating dosage forms. [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] In order to improve the gastric retention time of the drug, floating dosage forms that are less dense than the gastric fluid (1.004 g/cm 3 ) have been extensively studied, including single-unit and multiunit dosage forms. The single-unit dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, and capsules, have a shortcoming in that drugs exhibit an \"all-or-nothing\" release in the emptying process. 15,17 Hollow microspheres, as a multiunit floating drug delivery system, pass through the gastrointestinal tract, avoid gastric emptying, and then release the drug more uniformly. Furthermore, compared with single-unit dosage forms, the more uniform the distribution of these multiunit drug dosage forms is in the gastrointestinal tract, the more reproducible drug absorption and the less local irritation will be obtained. [25][26][27] The objective of the study was to develop and evaluate multiple-unit hollow microspheres containing 5-FU in order to prolong the release of the drug and improve oral bioavailability and biodistribution in a tumor-bearing model animal. On the basis of our previous studies, 25,26 solvent diffusion-evaporation method was used to prepare 5-FU hollow microspheres employing various ratios of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and ethyl cellulose (EC) as drug controlled-release polymer blends. The morphology, particle size distribution, drug loading amount, floating properties, and in vitro drug release behavior of 5-FU loaded hollow microspheres were investigated. In addition, the pharmacokinetic behavior in rabbits and biodistribution in a tumorbearing model animal of 5-FU hollow microspheres were compared with that of its nonfloating microspheres (solid microspheres) and its powder in rabbits to assess the usefulness of oral hollow microspheres drug delivery system.",

From our previous studies, 26,28,29 the process of o/o type emulsification is very important to form hollow microspheres. Thus, when the other conditions were equal, the effect of Span 80 concentration in the liquid paraffin on particle size, drug loading amount, and production yield of 5-FU hollow microspheres was investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen from particle size distribution that when Span 80 (as emulsifier) concentration in the liquid paraffin was increased from 0.5% (w/v) to 2.0% (w/v), the particle size of 5-FU hollow microspheres decreased, because of the decreasing interfacial tension between organic phase and liquid paraffin. In order to stabilize o/o emulsion, the main function of Span 80 is to form a thin film around the droplets to prevent their coalescence. 11 In fact, when the concentration of Span 80 was 1.5%, a more uniform particle size distribution of 5-FU hollow microspheres was obtained. In other words, the percentage of a 5-FU hollow microsphere ranged from 450 to 600 \u00b5m in diameter (67.5%\u00b11.6%). As shown in Table 1, drug loading amount and production yield increased with increasing concentration of the Span 80 up to 1.5%. However, when the concentration of the Span 80 was more than 1.5%, the drug loading amount and production yield decreased. Thus, 1.5% of Span 80 was chosen as an emulsifier for further study.

When ethanol was employed alone as organic phase, no hollow microspheres were observed, except some nonfloating microspheres (solid microspheres). The reason was that ethanol cannot diffuse into the liquid paraffin: the polymer cannot aggregate between the continuation phase and dispersion phase. 28,29 In comparison with ethanol alone, a mixture of ether and ethanol was used to obtain 5-FU hollow microspheres. Interestingly, after emulsification of about 5 minutes, the air bubble was observed in the microsphere droplets by using an optical microscope. This was because the ether can be quickly diffused into the liquid paraffin, resulting in polymer instantly solidifing into a thin film. When ether/ethanol volume ratio was increased from 0.5:10.0 to 1.0:10.0, drug loading amount and production yield increased, too. However, when the concentration of the ether/ethanol volume ratio was more than 1.0:10.0, the drug loading amount and production yield decreased. In addition, there was no difference in particle size distribution among three samples prepared by ether/ethanol volume ratio that ranged from 0.5:10.0 to 1.5:10.0 (P\ue02e0.05). Therefore, ether/ ethanol (1.0:10.0, v/v) was used for further study.",

            "text": "As shown in Table 3, the average diameter and drug loading amount increased with the increased PVP/EC weight ratio from 0:10 to 1.0:10.0. The reason was that a higher viscosity of the internal phase with increasing PVP/EC weight ratio rendered a higher resistance to the shearing of emulsion, thereby increasing the particle size of 5-FU hollow microspheres. 15 Another possibility is that the rapid polymer precipitation resulted in hardness avoiding further particle size reduction during solvent evaporation. 26 Drug loading amount is usually associated with the particle size distribution of microspheres, and the larger the particle size, the higher the drug loading amount. In general, as the particle size of 5-FU hollow microspheres was increased, the thickness of the wall of microspheres increased. The result was in agreement with the results reported in literature. 27 In addition, when the   PVP/EC weight ratio was increased from 0:10.0 to 1.0:10.0, there was no significant difference in the production yield of 5-FU hollow microspheres (P\ue02e0.05). However, as the PVP/EC weight ratio was increased to 2.0:10.0, production yield decreased. A possible reason is that the viscosity of drug-polymer solution at PVP/EC weight ratio of 2.0:10.0 was too high to disperse in liquid paraffin containing Span 80 (1.5%, w/v), forming an o/o type emulsion. As shown in Figure 4, 5-FU hollow microspheres in the case of PVP/EC weight ratio ranging from 0:10 to 1.0:10.0 possessed good buoyancy in gastric fluid and intestinal fluid containing Tween-80 that simulates the surface tension of gastrointestinal fluids. 24 More specifically, the buoyancy rate of these hollow microspheres after 12 hours was more than 95%. Furthermore, no significant difference in the buoyancy rate among these formulations was observed (P\ue02e0.05). However, when 5-FU hollow microspheres were prepared using PVP/EC weight ratio of 2.0:10.0, the buoyancy rate decreased to 53.7%\u00b12.9% and 51.5%\u00b13.6% after 12 hours in simulated gastric fluid and intestinal fluid, respectively. The phenomenon could be explained in that the channels on the surface of 5-FU hollow microspheres, which resulted from PVP and 5-FU dissolution, became too large to be penetrated into the hollow cavities by the release medium with an increasing of PVP/EC weight ratio up to 2.0:10.0.",

It was observed that drug release kinetics in simulated gastric fluid and intestinal fluid was significantly influenced by the PVP/EC weight ratio. Importantly, not only the slope but also the shape of the release curves was affected, 26 which showed differences in the underlying drug release mechanisms. However, there was no difference in release behaviors in both the release mediums. When PVP/EC (0:10.0) was used to prepare 5-FU hollow microspheres, at the end of 24 hours the cumulative drug release amount in simulated gastric fluid and intestinal fluid was only 62.5%\u00b12.0% and 60.2%\u00b12.9%, respectively.

In the case of PVP/EC weight ratio of 2.0:10.0, the hollow microspheres containing 5-FU released 100% of the drug within 8 hours.

As shown in Table 4, there was no difference in particle size distribution, drug loading amount, production yield, and floating efficiency of 5-FU hollow microspheres. In vitro floating efficiency investigation indicated that, in spite of stirring the simulated gastric fluid for 12 hours, more than 95.0% 5-FU hollow microspheres still continued floating. As shown in Figure 4, 5-FU hollow microspheres were spherical with a cavity within a hard polymer shell and a lot of pores in internal walls of hollow microspheres, which resulted in lower density.

The mean plasma drug concentration-time curve is shown in Figure 8 and the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters calculated by DAS 2.0 software are summarized in Table 5. As shown in Figure 8 and Table 5, 5-FU hollow microspheres demonstrated the greatest absorption and the slowest elimination after gavage administration in comparison with its solid microspheres and powder. The C max and T max of 5-FU solid microspheres and powder were 2.25\u00b10.22 mg/L and 1.00\u00b10.15 hours, and 2.55\u00b10.19 mg/L and 0.75\u00b10.11 hours, respectively; the plasma drug concentration was detectable up to 12 and 8 hours, whereas the    C max and T max of hollow microspheres were 1.64\u00b10.21 mg/L and 2.00\u00b10.22 hours, respectively. At 24 hours after gavage administration of 5-FU hollow microspheres, the drug concentration in plasma was still detectable at about 0.13\u00b10.02 mg/L. These results suggested that 5-FU from hollow microspheres possessed slower drug release or absorption relatively. The t 1/2 and MRT of 5-FU hollow microspheres were 15.43\u00b12.12 hours and 7.65\u00b10.97 hours, respectively, which were longer than those of its solid microspheres at t 1/2 of 2.25\u00b10.22 hours and MRT of 3.61\u00b10.41 hours, and powder at t 1/2 of 1.43\u00b10.18 hours and MRT of 2.34\u00b10.35 hours, respectively. Furthermore, it was worth noting that 5-FU hollow microspheres exhibited higher area under curve (AUC) (0\u2212t) than its powder (12.53\u00b11.65 mg/L*h vs 7.80\u00b10.83 mg/L*h and 5.82\u00b10.83 mg/L*h, P\ue02c0.01). It was suggested that 5-FU hollow microspheres prolonged drug residence time in the gastrointestinal tract due to its good floating characteristic in gastric fluid, leading to a better and longer absorption effect. Li et al developed acyclovir-loaded spray-dried hollow microspheres and investigated its pharmacokinetic behavior in rabbits. The results showed it improved two to three folds in the oral bioavailability of acyclovir. 32 Another study also indicated riboflavin-loaded microballoons as a floating controlled drug delivery system were very useful for improving oral drug bioavailability in healthy humans. 33 ",

[11][12][13][14] However, there are very few studies on the biodistribution in a tumor-bearing animal model after oral administration. In the present study, drug biodistribution behaviors were carried out in tumor-bearing mice model to investigate the amount of 5-FU that is delivered to main organs and tumors. The content of 5-FU in tumor and main organs including heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and stomach at 0.5, 1, and 8 hours was measured by the HPLC method and illustrated in Figure 9 after oral administration of 5-FU hollow microspheres as a test formulation and its solid microspheres and powder as controls in the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose suspension form at a dose of 72 mg/kg body weight. As shown in Figure 9, the elimination of 5-FU powder was the fastest among the three formulations in plasma, tumor, and main organs, while the drug concentration in biosamples at 8 hours after administration was not detectable. 5-FU hollow microspheres and its solid microspheres showed similar drug distribution trends in tumor-bearing mice.

As a multiple-unit floating drug delivery system, 5-FU hollow microspheres were developed successfully by a solvent diffusion-evaporation method. An excellent reproducibility of formulation and technology was obtained. The microspheres were spherical with hollow structures with high drug loading amount and production yield. 5-FU hollow microspheres exhibited excellent floating and sustained release characteristics. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that 5-FU hollow microspheres showed significantly enhanced absorption and oral bioavailability with longer t 1/2 and MRT, which contributed to prolonging drug residence time in the gastrointestinal tract due to its good floating characteristic in gastric fluid. In vivo distribution results from tumor-bearing nude mice indicated that 5-FU hollow microspheres could improve tissue distribution characteristics of 5-FU to some extent. It could be concluded that the hollow microspheres would be a promising sustained and controlled drug delivery system for an oral delivery chemotherapy agent like 5-FU.",
