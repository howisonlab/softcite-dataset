However, until now, it has not been possible to study these dynamically and in real time. In this study, we use spectrally distinct, well-recognised fluorescent cell death markers to enable the temporal resolution and quantification of the early and late phases of apoptosis and necrosis of single nerve cells in different disease models. The tracking of single-cell death profiles in the same living eye over hours, days, weeks and months is a significant advancement on currently available techniques. We identified a numerical preponderance of late-phase versus early-phase apoptotic cells in chronic models, reinforcing the commonalities between cellular mechanisms in different disease models. We showed that MK801 effectively inhibited both apoptosis and necrosis, but our findings support the use of our technique to investigate more specific anti-apoptotic and anti-necrotic strategies with well-defined targets, with potentially greater clinical application. The optical properties of the eye provide compelling opportunities for the quantitative monitoring of disease mechanisms and dynamics in experimental neurodegeneration. Our findings also help to directly observe retinal nerve cell death in patients as an adjunct to refining diagnosis, tracking disease status and assessing therapeutic intervention.",

Furthermore, given the emergence of mechanistic commonalities between different neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and glaucoma, 5,6 an appreciation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of cell death in one disease could enhance our understanding of other diseases, in terms of both the molecular pathophysiology and the potential therapeutic avenues.",

To simultaneously detect three different fluorochromes, we first customised a prototype Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO) 1 to enable the detection of different emission wavelengths. The parameters used were based on well-established fluorescently tagged cell markers, selected because of their distinct spectral properties and minimal overlap, and the emitted light collection was optimised with appropriate filters (Figure 1). For identification of apoptotic cells, we used Alexa Fluor 488labelled annexin V (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), which has an excitation and emission maxima of 495 and 519 nm, respectively, with an argon laser and a solid-state photodetector with a 521 nm cut-off filter and a 550 nm cut-on filter. 1 To identify necrotic and late-apoptotic RGCs, we used PI with an excitation and emission maxima of 532 and 649 nm, respectively, with detection using a diode-pumped crystal green laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and a 650 nm cut-off filter on the photodetector. After an empirical assessment Figure 1 Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) and detection of fluorescent-labelled cells. Simultaneous detection of multiple markers was achieved by customising the cSLO as follows: for identification of annexin 488, an argon laser wavelength of 488 nm and a solid-state photodetector with a 521 nm cut-off filter and a 550 nm cut-on filter were used; for DiI, a diode-pumped crystal green laser with a wavelength of 532 nm was used with 550 nm cut-off and 600 nm cut-on filters; the same laser was used for PI visualisation but with a 650 nm cut-off. The inset graph shows the emission spectra of cellular marker fluorochromes used in this study. Alexa Fluor 488labelled annexin V (green; annexin 488), DiI (blue; 1,1 0 -dioctadecyl-3,3,3 0 ,3 0 -tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate) and propidium iodide (red; PI) have excitation/emission maxima of 495/519, 550/570 and 532/649 nm, respectively. (a-d) Monochrome images from each retinal area were acquired using the appropriate laser setup and colourised. Three-colour images were produced by combining each of the grey scale images from the cLSO into the green (a, annexin 488), blue (b, DiI) and red channels (c, PI) of an RGB colour image, and merged to form the image shown in (d) (scale bar 100 mm) of several different compounds, including DiAsp (4-(4-(didecylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (4-Di-10-Asp)), Fluorogold and Rhodamine B, we determined that DiI was the most suitable RGC marker in our rat models, with an excitation and emission maxima of 550 and 570 nm, respectively. The same laser used for PI was used for DiI visualisation, but with 550 nm cut-off and 600 nm cut-on filters.",

First, some cells were found to be labelled only with PI ('PI only', red spots, Figure 3c), others were initially annexin V positive and subsequently became PI positive ('Annexin first', green spots, Figure 3c), whereas others became positive for both dyes at approximately the same time ('similar profiles', yellow spots, Figure 3c).

The corresponding scatter plots (blue) from the eyes shown in Figures 4a and b are illustrated in Figures 4c and d. Data were analysed in a manner similar to that of data derived by in vitro FACS analysis, with four quadrants (midlines shaded in colour overlay as red, green, blue and yellow) enabling separation of the different phases of cell death as annexin V positive (early apoptosis, green), annexin V and PI double positive (late apoptosis, yellow) and PI positive (necrosis, red). Thresholds were set automatically by the plugin for the analysis of each eye. We then used fluorescence intensity counts from the raw scatter plots to quantify each phase of cell death. MK801 treatment clearly reduced the overall levels of cell death (total), but more particularly, the number of cells in late-phase apoptosis and necrosis ( Figure 4e). Interestingly, there was a small increase in the number of early-phase apoptotic cells (Anx \u00fe ) in MK801-treated eyes (Figure 4e). As these are destined to become Anx \u00fe /PI \u00fe , this suggests that, although the results generally support the neuroprotective role of NMDA antagonists in Ab-induced neuronal cell death, 13 it may be that the protective effects of MK801 seem transient because of its single application in these experiments.",

These results support the hypothesis that PMA potentiates Ab-induced ROS damage via predominantly apoptotic pathways. 14 Using the same methodology, we next compared the relative levels of cell death phases between the SSP and Ab acute models of RGC death, at the time points at which we previously showed peak RGC annexin V positivity to occur, that is, at 2 and 72 h, respectively. 1,6 Images were reanalysed for all treated animals using co-localisation scatter plots and the same methodology as described above. Figure 4k illustrates that both SSP and Ab models exhibit similar patterns of cell death at the time of peak apoptosis. The cell death profiles in both models showed significantly more cells in the late phase of apoptosis (Po0.05) as opposed to necrosis or early apoptosis.",

Having demonstrated the application of this technique in two acute models of RGC death, we next investigated models of chronic retinal neurodegeneration, which more closely resemble human disease. Our group has previously characterised, using in vivo and histological profiling of RGC apoptosis, an experimental glaucoma rat model of ocular hypertension (OHT) caused by chronically elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). 1,9 RGCs were retrogradely labelled using previously described methods with DiI 1,6 and animals were imaged repeatedly after administration of intravitreal annexin V at different time points to generate time-lapse video sequences (Figures 5a-f and Supplementary Video 3). Assessment of intact labelled RGCs in the glaucoma model (identified by DiI, blue, Figure 5a) revealed dramatic changes in single RGCs. As expected, when compared with the number of cells identified at baseline (Figure 5b) and at 3 weeks (Figure 5c), the number of labelled RGCs evident at 8 weeks was markedly reduced (Figure 5d) after surgical induction of elevated IOP. Analysis of apoptosis induction in these retinas revealed that those RGCs that were annexin V positive at 3 weeks (Figure 5e) disappeared by 8 weeks (Figure 5f), suggesting that a wave of apoptosis follows the initial IOP elevation insult, which is followed in turn by the clearance of dead cells.",

The projection enabled the quantitative assessment of maximal annexin V and DiI staining at each pixel in the same retinal area studied over time. Although there was a high overlap ratio of annexin V staining with DiI (0.63, confirming the presence of apoptosis at the level of the RGCs), there was a very low ratio (0.072) of DiI cells also positive for annexin V. This demonstrates either that only some RGCs were ever annexin V positive and that apoptosis is not the only pathway responsible for cell death in this model, or that annexin V positivity is transient (as shown in Figure 3).",

There is growing evidence of retinal involvement in AD, with the demonstration using histological techniques that RGC apoptosis occurs in double transgenic AD models. 3,4 To determine whether phasing of RGC death could be assessed in vivo in another model of chronic neurodegeneration, we next applied our technique to a triple transgenic AD model (3xTg-AD). This is an increasingly used model of AD, which overexpresses APPSwe and tauP301L, as well as carries a PS1M146V knock-in mutation, and is currently the only existing transgenic model with both Ab and tau neuropathology. 8 An accumulation of intraneuronal Ab occurs early, which decreases as extracellular plaques are deposited, similar to the development of disease and in brains of patients with Down's syndrome. 15 Previous transgenic studies 3,4 have shown that in the double AD APP/PS1 mouse line, the level of RGC apoptosis increased with age, being more preponderant at 27 than at 7.8 months. However, in these studies aged (27-months old) wildtype congeners were not assessed. Figure 6a demonstrates the typical appearance of the eye of a 14-month-old 3xTg-AD model imaged at 2 h after intravitreal PI and annexin-IR treatment alongside the similarly imaged eye of an 18-monthold control (PS1KI transgenic mouse that shows no Ab and tau neuropathology 16 ) (Figure 6b). To quantify the levels of the different phases of cell death, we again used data generated from co-localisation scatter plot analysis, which showed significantly more RGCs in the phase of early apoptosis (Po0.05, green, Anx \u00fe ) and less necrosis (Po0.05, red, PI \u00fe ) in 3xTg-AD compared with aged control (Figure 6c). These data show that, although a low level of apoptotic and necrotic cell death occurs as a correlate of normal healthy ageing in mice, in AD mice, there is a significant increase in the relative numbers of RGCs in early-phase apoptosis.",

PMA seemed to increase the level of annexin staining in the treated eyes of both animals. However, quantification revealed that although PMA treatment significantly increased early-phase apoptosis in both control and 3xTg-AD eyes (Po0.05, Figures 6f and g), the magnitude of the increase was far less in control eyes than in 3xTg-AD (30.3% in aged control, 61.4% in 3xTg-AD).

The higher magnification image (green box in (a)) taken at time zero (b) shows the normal density of RGCs, with little change at 3 weeks (c). However, there was marked RGC dropout 8 weeks after surgical induction of elevated IOP (d). When the data were analysed with respect to the identification of apoptosis in these same cells, it was clear that those RGCs that were annexin V positive at 3 weeks (e) were no longer identifiable at 8 weeks (f), confirming that cells originally classified as undergoing apoptosis degenerated 5 weeks later. (g) Only a small proportion of RGCs was identified in early-phase apoptosis (annexin V only) compared with late-phase apoptosis (both annexin V and PI staining) at 3 weeks. (h) MK801 treatment of animals at the time of surgery significantly reduced the number of both apoptotic and necrotic cells 3 weeks after treatment.

Treatment with MK801 led to a significant reduction (Po0.05) in the number of dying cells (total), mostly because of a significant decrease in the levels of necrosis (P40.05, red, PI \u00fe ) and late apoptotic (P40.05, yellow, Anx \u00fe /PI \u00fe ) cell death.

It has enabled us to identify a numerical preponderance of late-phase versus early-phase apoptotic cells in vivo, and reinforced the commonalities between disease mechanisms in the different models studied. The predominance of late-phase apoptosis may reflect not only the relatively short duration of the early phase compared with the late phase (previously estimated as within 1 hour ex vivo, 18 and suggesting that the relative likelihood of detecting cells in early apoptosis is low at any given time 19 ) but also, as we show here ('similar profiles' in Figure 3), the coincidental appearance of annexin V and PI positivity in many apoptotic cells.",

It will be interesting to use the imaging technique developed in this study, in combination with the many fluorescent cell-permeant probes available for caspase activation, Ca 2 \u00fe fluxes, mitochondrial function and so on, to examine degeneration phases in other transgenic neurodegeneration models, as the balance between apoptosis and necrosis is still unclear in chronic disease. Furthermore, delineation of the timing of such events and their association with RGC apoptosis will highlight processes that precede the irreversible stages of cellular degeneration, and provide improved and specific targets for neuroprotection.",

The ability to differentiate between apoptosis and necrosis and non-invasively track cell death in neurodegenerative pathologies could have an important role in medical diagnostics and therapy management. Furthermore, we believe that the concept of an early apoptotis/necrosis ratio with a correlation to disease activity may provide an invaluable tool for staging neurodegeneration. There is increasing evidence of the potential reversibility of early apoptosis, suggesting that a high early apoptosis/necrosis ratio may offer a good prognosis for treatment. 33,34 In conclusion, the application of this new technology has far-reaching implications for studying intracellular processes at the single-cell level in vivo. Although the equipment we use in these studies has been customised to suit animal models, the instruments are essentially the same as those used in hospitals and clinics around the world. This raises the possibility that in the near future, clinicians may be able to assess retinal nerve cell death in vivo as a method of monitoring disease progression and treatment efficacy. Whether a single snapshot or long-term in vivo observation over many weeks is needed, the ability to visualise and track changes in cell viability offers the potential for major advances in the diagnosis and management of neurodegenerative diseases.",

DiI was applied 10 days before all the rat treatment procedures detailed above. DiI is a long-chain dialkylcarbocyanine lipophilic neuronal tracer, which does not affect cell viability, development or the basic cellular physiological properties. 36 Using a method that we recently described, rats were administered 2.5 mg of intravitreal Alexa Fluor 488-labelled annexin V in 5 ml PBS for identification of RGC apoptosis, 2 h before in vivo imaging. 1 For mice, we used 1 ml of a 0.25 mg/ml solution of IR-labelled annexin (Annexin-IR) through intravitreal injections as previously described. 37 To identify necrotic RGCs in rats (2 ml) and mice (1 ml), PI (0.4 mg/ml, 1% solution, Sigma-Aldrich) was administered intravitreally at the same time as annexin, 2 h before in vivo imaging.

All rats had in vivo retinal imaging performed at regular and set intervals after experimental treatment using a prototype Zeiss cSLO, as previously described. 1,11 Imaging was performed under general anaesthesia with animals being held in a stereotaxic frame, with their pupils dilated. Different lasers and filters were used for different fluorochromes: for excitation of Alexa Fluor 488, an argon laser wavelength of 488 nm and a solid state photodetector with a 521 nm cut-off filter and a 550 nm cut-on filter were used; for DiI, a diode-pumped crystal green laser with a wavelength of 532 nm was used with 550 nm cut-off and 600 nm cut-on filters; the same laser was used for PI visualisation, but with a 650 nm cut-off. The cSLO used in this study is the same as that described previously, with modifications complying with the established standards for safety and light exposure. 1,37 We have developed a purpose-written software to allow optimal processing of low-light fluorescent signals, which has greatly aided our live cell imaging. 1 Monochrome images from each area were acquired using the appropriate laser setup and colourised. Three-colour images were produced by combining each of the grey scale images from the cSLO into the red (PI), green (annexin 488) and blue channels (DiI) of an RGB colour image. Images were processed in this way because red, green and blue (RGB) colours are universally accepted as the most informative methods for showing co-localisation. The ImageJ Intensity Correlation Analysis plugin was applied to generate co-localisation scatter plots and colour thresholds. 12 Colour and raw scatter plots of annexin and PI fluorescence intensity were constructed; hence, the data could be analysed in a similar manner to that of the data derived by in vitro FACS analysis. Separation of the different phases of cell death according to whether they were annexin V positive (early apoptosis), annexin V and PI double positive (late apoptosis) or PI positive (necrosis) was enabled by the adoption of thresholds set automatically by the plugin for each analysis. Fluorescence intensity counts derived from raw scatter plots were used to quantify each phase of cell death.",

The same software was used to analyse video-sequenced images as described before, with whole retinal monochrome images of each eye recorded and colourised. Dual-color images were produced by combining each of the grey scale images from the cSLO into the red (PI) and green (IR annexin) channels of an RGB colour image.",

(a, b) Wide-angle retinal images showing the Ab-treated right eye (a) and Ab \u00fe MK801-treated left eye (b) of a single mouse. MK801 reduces the number of annexin V (green)-and PI (red)-positive cells 72 h after intravitreal Ab(25-35) application.To assess the magnitude of late apoptosis, we studied the co-localisation of PI and annexin V using ImageJ software with the Intensity Correlation Analysis plugin.12 (c, d) Scatter plots show the distribution of annexin and PI fluorescence intensity in the eyes shown in (a, b), Ab alone (c) and Ab \u00fe MK801 (d). (e) Thresholds were set automatically by the plugin for each analysis (colour overlay in (c, d)), and quantification of each cell death phase was performed from generated data (e). MK801 treatment reduced the overall levels of cell death (blue, total), mostly by reducing the number of cells in late-phase apoptosis (yellow, Anx \u00fe /PI \u00fe ) and necrosis (red, PI \u00fe ). (f, g) Wideangle retinal images showing the Ab-treated right eye (f) and Ab \u00fe PMA-treated left eye (g) of a single mouse. (h, i) PMA increased the level of annexin V (green) and PI (red) positivity, as shown in the corresponding scatter plots. (j) Quantification of all treated animals shows that PMA significantly (Po0.05) increases the overall levels of cell death (blue, total), most of this being due to a significant (Po0.05) increase in the number of cells in the early phase of apoptosis (green, Anx \u00fe ). (k) Comparison of cell phases in all Ab and SSP models using co-localisation scatter plot analysis. At the previously established time points of maximal apoptosis (Ab \u00bc 72 h and SSP \u00bc 2 h), both models show a similar trend, with no significant difference in the magnitude of any phase of cell death. However, both models show significantly more RGCs in the phases of late apoptosis (P40.05, yellow, Anx \u00fe /PI \u00fe ) and necrosis (P40.05, red, PI \u00fe ) than early apoptosis (green, Anx \u00fe ).
