Method We examined 15 aphasic patients (nine males, six females) who had suff ered a stroke (average age 49.7 years) and 15 healthy controls (average age 47.4 years). An aphasia examination was made by an aphasia battery of three standard tests and VOT was analyzed instrumentally. Stop consonants in the initial and intervocalic position were measured to categorize them according to aphasia types, place of articulation, and manner of articulation. Results VOT of the aphasic patients with peculiarities of aspiration had a greater difference than that of the controls, indicating that the temporal non-coordination between the laryngeal adjustment and oral articulators of aphasic patients happens due to the VOT of stops in the initial and intervocalic positions (p<0.05). Conclusion VOT of stop consonants in the initial position produced by aphasic patients tends to be proportional to their breathing. It can cause glottal width and make aphasic patients' VOT duration longer. Lastly, the method to measure the VOT of aphasic patients is more significant for the types of phonation than for the places of articulation, and makes it possible to induce abnormal VOT.",

            "text": "Aphasia is a partial or general disorder of recognition systems and other communication mechanisms, which are the basis of language patterns and language itself, and which is due to damage to the speech portion of the central nervous system, and it is often defined as the neurological disability to understand or form language. 1 Also, the language disorder of aphasic patients can be categorized in two ways: typological, in which one or more aspects of language understanding, where the output of aphasia patients is invaded, and non-typolo gical, in which all other aspects of language underwww.e-arm.org standing and output have been damaged. 2 How ever, there can be some cases where this defi nition might not be limited to language and the cognitive process or the domain of language. 3 Generally, a language disorder from cerebral damage is termed 'aphasia' and a speech sound disorder is termed 'dysarthria' . For several decades, cerebral neurologists, psychologists, and linguists have studied mainly aphasia lan guage disorder. Recent advances phonology and sound analysis equipment have enabled the study of dysar thria, which occurs when aphasia patients speak. In the phonological field, 4 phonological codes or damage to work memory have been intensively studied, while the voice onset time (VOT) of aphasic patients and the length of vowels and syllables have been studied and compared with a control group in the fi eld of acoustics. 5 The study of temporal abnormalities, 6 especially those related to VOT and the length of syllables of aphasic patients, has contributed to the study of damage to language or word exercise plans, or the apraxia func tion, and the evaluative study of time coordination 7 bet ween larynx and oral articulating organs. It also has emphasized the importance of articulation places and the output of the voiced and voiceless consonants of stop con sonants. 8 Such studies make it possible to expand the range of interpretation for the speech evaluation of apha sia patients, and VOT studies can be understood as extensive, involving speech exercise plans and apraxia function. VOT has been used as a phonological clue or index for the study of interaction between articulating exercises and laryngeal adjustment. Th us, this study aimed to address the hypothesis that, in the Korean language, the phonological characteristics of consonants rather than those of vowels are more focused because the VOT shows the degree of aspiration better in the beginning of the speech when the stop sounds are articulated, and is used as a main measure in light of the fact that it can show phonological diff erence according to the places of consonants and the types of phonation. Also, to analyze whether there is any difference in phonetic processes according to articulation places phonologically, the output of voiced and voiceless consonants was analyzed according to the articulation sites, and the sound spectral time of the phonetic environment was compared and evaluated, to be used as the baseline data for the evaluation and diagnosis of aphasic patients.",

In other words, the noise interval can be understood as a voice lag until the vowel formant is observed after the vertical spike on the spectrogram, which is observed due to the opening of the stop sound that is located at the word-initial. In addition, the fi nding that the length of the VOT of aphasic patients was longer than that of the normal control group indicated that the sound timing could vary relating to the lead time between abnormal or vocal abduction and oral plosive, owing to non-coordination between larynx and oral articulating organs, due to the turbulence which is formed at larynx. 14 Th ese results are likely attributable to an inelastic stiff ness of the larynx and the loss of exercise due to the damage to the central nervous system and cranial nerves, 15 so the VOT differences arise according to the degree of damage to the interaction between the tongue, pharynx, and larynx, which are related with stop sounds.",

However, sometimes lead time and the vowel length before the consonant stop sound are often measured and compared because it is not always true that all aphasic patients make voicing errors. As seen in Fig. 1-A and 1-B, the c interval was long as the lead time in aphasic patients and the vowel length is also shown long, consistent with previous studies. 17,18 Some studies have assumed that the output diff erence of voiced \u2022 unvo iced consonants of aphasic patients are the interaction between the muscles of arytenoids cartilage and posterior cricoarytenoid cartilage, which are known to control the distinction of the voiced and voiceless consonants. 19 Although the normal sound of VCV has a small amount of aspiration, the vocal cord's vibration interval (d) in aphasic patients turns out long, which means that there could be a temporal non-coordination between the larynx and the oral articulating organs, not only at the word-initial, but also at the intervocalic VCV. Th is should be examined more widely in more subjects.",
