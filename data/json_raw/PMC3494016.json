The pRb relative, p107, compensates some of the functions of pRb in these tissues; however, Rb F/F ;K14cre;p107 2/2 mice die postnatally. Here we show, using an inducible mouse model (Rb F/F ;K14creER TM), that p107 exerts specific tumor suppressor functions in the absence of pRb in stratified epithelia. The simultaneous absence of pRb and p107 produces impaired p53 transcriptional functions and reduction of Pten expression, allowing spontaneous squamous carcinoma development. These tumors display significant overlap with human squamous carcinomas, supporting that Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mice might constitute a new model for these malignancies. Remarkably tumor development in vivo is partially alleviated by mTOR inhibition. These data demonstrate the existence of a previously unreported functional connection between pRb, Pten and p53 tumor suppressors, through p107, of a particular relevance in squamous tumor development.",

Accordingly, it plays tumor suppressor functions in multiple tissues, and the disruption of the 'Rb pathway', either by direct Rb1 gene mutation or, more frequently, via alterations affecting pRb biological functions, is a hallmark of most sporadic human cancers 2 . To analyze Rb1 roles in vivo in adult mice, several tissue specific knock outs have been generated, as mouse models bearing complete Rb1 gene loss displayed embryonic lethality [3][4][5] . The constitutive somatic elimination of Rb1 gene in epidermis (Rb F/F ;K14cre mice) produced altered proliferation and differentiation, but it was insufficient to promote tumor development 6 . Moreover, upon chemical carcinogenesis protocols, Rb F/F ;K14cre mice showed reduced tumor incidence and multiplicity as compared to controls. However, the Rb-deficient tumors displayed increased malignancy with high rate of conversion from papillomas to squamous cell carcinomas 7 . This paradoxical observation was explained by an early and acute p53 induction in benign tumor cells, which promoted a selective pressure leading to premature p53 inactivation and increased malignancy 7 . The connection between pRb and p53 in this context was further supported by the findings obtained in mice bearing p53 deletion in stratified epithelia (p53 F/F ;K14cre mice), in which the spontaneous tumor development was accelerated by simultaneous epidermal Rb1 loss 8 . Remarkably, spontaneous tumors arising in these pRb F/F ;p53 F/F ;K14cre mice are highly aggressive and display early signs of chromosomal instability 8,9 and high metastatic behavior associated with deregulated miRNA expression 10 . Further, genomic profiling of these spontaneous tumors also revealed a significant overlap with multiple human malignancies distinguished by poor prognosis, altered p53 status and, remarkably, high metastasis incidence 11 .",

This seems to be the case of E2F1 12 and p107 13 , but not p130 14 . The fact that the Rb F/F ;K14cre phenotype was aggravated in a p107 2/2 background, leading to early postnatal death 6 , supports the hypothesis that the pRb relative p107 can exert some of the functions of pRb in its absence in epidermis. Importantly, a number of evidences also suggested a possible tumor suppressor role for p107 in absence of pRb 13 . First, double deficient keratinocytes are highly sensitive to Ha-ras-mediated transformation and displayed reduced oncogene-induced premature senescence 13 . Second, transplants of Rb F/F ;K14cre;p107 2/2 skin, but not Rb F/F ;K14cre, invariably developed squamous tumors 13 . And third, the altered behavior of Rb F/F ;K14cre mice to chemical carcinogenesis is partially alleviated by a reduction of p107 amounts 15 . These findings could also indicate that the absence of p107 affects p53 functions. Indeed, transcriptome analysis of new born epidermis revealed the downregulation of several p53-dependent genes in Rb F/F ;K14cre;p107 2/2 mice 13 , suggesting the existence of new functional connections between Rb family of proteins and p53 in this tissue 16 . These gene expression studies showed the underexpression of Pten in Rb F/F ;K14cre;p107 2/2 new born skin samples. Pten is a tumor suppressor gene, induced by several mechanisms including p53 activation 17 , which regulates cell survival by PI3K/AKT pathway 18 . Inactivation of Pten gene is found in multiple tumors including human 19 and mouse 20 skin cancers.",

Histology analyses of snout samples revealed that, compared to controls (Fig. 1d), Rb F/F ; K14creER TM mice display a moderate hyperplasia and mild hyperkeratosis ( Fig. 1e). However, in Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mice a generalized hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and downgrowths of epithelial cells suggestive of tumoral or pretumoral lesions were observed ( Fig. 1f). Compared to the hyerplasic regions of Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ; p107 2/2 mouse snouts ( Fig. 1g), the lesions showed areas of laminin loss ( Fig. 1g') thus confirming that they correspond to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Similar types of tumors were found in all Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 in snout ( Fig. 1h), neck (Fig. 1h') and eyelids ( Fig. 1h''), in some cases associated to inflammatory processes ( Fig. 1i). Histology also evidenced the presence of sporadic tumors affecting lips ( Fig. 1j), palate ( Fig. 1k), oral epithelia ( Fig. 1l) and ventral tongue (Fig. 1m). The study of a cohort of Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ; p107 2/2 mice demonstrates that all mice (n522) developed tumors by two months after recombination induction (Fig. 1n). The analysis of pRb and p107 status in these tumors revealed that all of them display loss of p107 and generalized recombination of Rb F/F alleles after tamoxifen treatment (data not shown).",

However, the Rb F/F ;Pten F/F ;K14cre mice also display early lethality (Segrelles et al, unpublished data) and all of them died by 1 or 2 months after birth, precluding the analysis of adult mice. Despite this, comparative study of newborn skins from Rb F/F ;Pten F/F ;K14cre and Rb F/F ;K14cre;p107 2/2 mice transplanted onto immunodeficient mice (Supp Fig. S3e-e') revealed the development of massive epidermal outgrowths corresponding to well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas in both cases. Remarkably, the tumors displayed almost identical histopathological characteristics regardless their origin (either Rb F/F ;Pten F/F ;K14cre or Rb F/F ;K14cre;p107 2/2 mouse newborn skin; Supp. Fig. S3f-h').",

In agreement, previous gene expression analyses in Rb F/F ;K14cre; p107 2/2 newborn epidermis revealed the downregulation of a number of p53-induced genes, mainly involved in apoptosis 13 . Among these genes we observed the underexpression of Pten, which in certain tissues is transcriptionally induced by p53 17 . Consequently, the previous data and the extensive similarities between Rb F/F ;Pten F/F ; K14cre and Rb F/F ;K14cre;p107 2/2 mouse phenotypes, prompted us to study possible alterations in p53-and Pten-dependent signaling in Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mice.",

Nonetheless, this partial loss of pRb promoted the induction of p107 and a moderate increase in p130 ( Fig. 2a). In addition, it also induced p53 expression and its bona fide target p21 CIP1 , which are both further induced in Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 keratinocytes ( Fig. 2a). Among the other p53-family members, double deficient primary keratinocytes displayed a clear induction of DNp63a, without any significant increase in p73 or in DNp73. Similarly, Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 keratinocytes displayed increased levels of p53-Ser392 phosphorylated, -Lys373 Acetylated, and -Lys372 methylated ( Fig. 2a), which in some cases corresponded to increased expression of the corresponding posttranscriptional effectors Tip60, SetD8 and Smyd2, without significant variations in others such as Sirt1, Pcaf and CBP ( Fig. 2a). In spite of the increased levels of p53 and its active forms, luciferase experiments revealed that the p53-depending response was not induced in these double deficient cells (Fig. 2b), but rather decreased when compared to Rb F/F ;K14creER TM cells. On the contrary, the induction of E2F-responding elements upon pRb reduction was further increased in Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 keratinocytes (Fig. 2c). These data indicated that the p53-dependent transcription is impaired in Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 keratinocytes.",

The histology and biochemical characteristics of the spontaneous tumors of Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mice are reminiscent of those human squamous carcinomas displaying increased Akt activity. In order to explore this possibility and to characterize the possible molecular events leading to tumor development in Rb F/F ; K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mice, we performed a differential expression analysis between normal skin and carcinomas using microarrays. The selection of differentially expressed genes was performed by SAM test (see Materials and Methods), providing a gene signature of 2256-probesets (1128 overexpressed and 1128 underexpressed in tumors; hereafter 2256-gene signature) ( Supplementary Tables 1 and  2). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the samples using this gene signature revealed a homogeneous expression pattern in tumor samples ( Fig. 4a). Consistent with the functional roles of the retinoblastoma family members, most of the overexpressed genes in the tumors were involved in cell cycle regulation, or DNA replication and repair, as evidenced by enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology biological processes (GOBP) terms (Fig. 4b). Additionally, we also found overexpression of genes involved in keratinization and epidermal cell differentiation, in agreement with the differentiated histology of the Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mouse carcinomas, and processes such as RNA transport and splicing or translation (Fig. 4b).",

This shows a very significant overlap between overexpressed genes (Supplementary Table 3, overlap n529 to 239 genes, p values from 6.7 x10 24 to 5.0310 280 , odds ratio from 2 to 4.7) or underexpressed genes (Supplementary Table 4, overlap n548 to 162 genes, p values from 5.5310 27 to 2.1310 222 , odds ratio from 2. to 3.2) in mouse samples with multiple studies. Such extremely relevant overlapping, may suggest that transcriptome data could be used to extract common genes significantly deregulated in the Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mouse and human SCC tumors. We found that 33 genes overexpressed and 12 genes underexpressed in mouse tumors were also found in at least 7 of the 15 studies of human tumors analyzed (Figure 4c), which might represent common biomarkers of human and mouse SCC. This meta-analysis of interspecies comparison corroborated the high degree of similarity between mouse and human SCC carcinomas at the molecular level. To further reinforce these findings, and to provide a wider analysis of the similarity between the changes in gene expression in the Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mouse and other gene signatures, we performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) study. This revealed  ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 carcinomas. Z-scores in log 2 scale were calculated for heatmap visualization. b) Enrichment analysis in Gene Ontology Biological Processes from the carcinoma signature of Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mouse. Red bars correspond to overexpressed genes and green bars correspond to downregulated genes p-val: significance of enrichment. c) Common gene signature between Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ; p107 2/2 mouse and at least 7 out of 15 different human SCC studies (from lung, head and neck, skin, esophagus, and cervix) obtained from ''Cancer vs. Normal'' comparisons in Oncomine (see Supp Table S3 and S4). Red boxes represent human genes overexpressed in SCC compared with normal tissue. Blue boxes represent human genes underexpressed in SCC compared with normal tissue.

The HPV are present in human carcinomas of the cervix and head and neck with a prevalence of 90% and 30%, respectively. As the E7 oncogene from different HPVs induces the degradation of retinoblastoma family proteins [28][29][30] , we hypothesize that SCC of Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mice may also resemble HPV-infected human tumors. To confirm this, we compared the gene expression profiles between mouse and human HPV-infected carcinomas 31 of the tongue, tonsil and cervix. The results of this comparison (Figure 4d) showed a very high similarities in these groups, thus indicating that the Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mouse SCCs could be a potential model to understand the E7-dependent molecular mechanisms of HPV oncogenesis.",

            "text": "The Rb1 gene product is functionally inactivated in most human tumors 2 . However, Rb1 gene mutations are only found in small subsets of human tumors. This indicates that, as the functional inactivation of pRb probably also affects the other Rb family members p107 and p130, the specific inactivation of Rb1 gene is only able to induce tumorigenesis in restricted tissues 35,36 . In epidermis, although Rb1 loss promotes alterations in proliferation and differentiation, indicating the existence of unique functions for this protein in this tissue, it is insufficient to allow tumor development 6 . Overlapping functions between pRb and p107 in epidermis have been previously demonstrated in epidermis 6 . Interestingly, although there are dramatic changes in gene expression, the phenotype of Rb F/F ;K14cre is not aggravated by p130 loss 14 . These overlapping functions between pRb and p107 have been also described in other tissues 37,38 , but are particularly highlighted in stratified epithelia where the complete loss of pRb and p107 led to death by pnd 10 6 . Moreover, double deficient epidermis leads to spontaneous tumor development in transplanted new born skin, indicating putative tumor suppressor functions of p107 in the absence of pRb 13 . Accordingly, double deficient keratinocytes are highly susceptible to Ha-ras transformation and resistant to oncogene-induced premature senescence 13 . Here, using an inducible mouse model for pRb loss in stratified epithelia to overcome the early lethality, we confirm such tumor suppressor functions of p107. Previous microarray data using newborn epidermis samples, also revealed that the absence of pRb and p107 promoted overexpression of multiple E2F-dependent genes 13 . In contrast, in spite of p53 induction, multiple p53-dependent genes, predominantly associated to apoptosis induction, were actually downregulated 13 . Our present data also reinforce these findings, as we observe that the DNA damage-induced p53-activated genes are underexpressed in the Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mouse carcinomas, and a significant overlap in gene expression was observed between tumors arising in Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mice and spontaneous epidermal tumors promoted by specific deletion of p53 in stratified epithelia  (Trp53 F/F ;K14cre and Rb F/F ;Trp53 F/F ;K14cre genotypes) 33 . In addition, as p53-mediated repression acts through interfering with distal enhancer activity and p53-activated genes occurs at the promoter regions 32 , we may also suggest that somatic deletion of pRb and p107 efficiently affect direct binding of p53 to the promoter regions of activated genes rather than distal enhancer binding. However, when we monitored possible defective signaling that may account for the decreased transcriptional activity of p53 observed over apoptotic genes 39 , and in particular focusing on p53 acetylation 40 , phosphorylation and methylation 41 , we observed normal activation. This potentially discards that defects in these modifications may account for the observed effect. This aspect would deserve future investigation.",

Our data showing decreased p53 transcriptional activity and reduced Pten expression might support this observation. The specific upregulation of DNp63 and c-jun in double deficient keratinocytes can also contribute to the Pten gene downregulation, as these two transcription factors have been recently involved in Pten gene repression 25,26 .

The expression of a constitutive active Akt in stratified epithelia of transgenic mice led to preneoplasic lesions in the oral cavity and perioral regions 22,42 . Importantly, these lesions did not progress to overt squamous tumors due to the induction of premature senescence, which is overcome by specific ablation of p53, but not pRb 42 . Comparable incidence of tumors showing similar characteristics was found in mice bearing the specific elimination of Pten and p53 genes in stratified epithelia 42 . The present data are in agreement and also reinforce these observations, as the absence of p107 can bypass the oncogene-induced senescence in pRb-deficient keratinocytes 13 . Our data are also in agreement with the recent report showing that the loss of pRb and p107 can predispose to oral tumors in mice 43 , although the authors do not report any spontaneous tumor development 43 .

Despite progress in surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate for oral cancer has not improved significantly over the past decades and remains at about 50-55% 46 . Numerous new targeted therapies have been proposed for this disease, in particular affecting Akt pathway (discussed in 47 ). Our present data showing that rapamycin treatment significantly prevent the tumor development also reinforce these hypotheses and are in agreement with previous studies indicating that mTOR inhibition could be beneficial for the treatment of this type of cancer [48][49][50][51] . Also in agreement, we observed that the deregulated genes in mouse tumors are differentially expressed in cell lines sensitive to Akt or mTOR inhibition.",

We permutated the gene set for 1000 times rather than permutating the phenotype because the sample number is small. In Table  2, we analyze the enrichment of p53-activated and p53-repressed DNA damage response genes in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells within the mouse tumors when compared to normal skin. Gene sets were downloaded from 32 , and fall into 2 groups: i) 2070 genes activated and ii) 1627 genes repressed upon p53 activation with DNA damage agent adriamycin as determined by both ChIP-seq (with a pan-p53 antibody) and GE (GE) microarray data of mES cells 32 . ES and 14-d differentiated ES gene expression dataset was retrieved from the GEO database (GSE2972).",

Genes overexpressed or underexpressed in the mouse carcinomas were mapped to human gene symbols and loaded into the Oncomine database. We have searched for overlaps using different filtering criteria, based on the type of human cancer comparison performed. These criteria were: i) ''Cancer vs. Normal'', to search for similarities with human squamous cell carcinomas of different tissue of origin; ii) ''Drug sensitivity'', to search for similarities with human cancer cell lines with differential sensitivities to specific drugs; and iii) ''Other'', to search for similarities with human papillomavirus (HPV) infected tumors.",
