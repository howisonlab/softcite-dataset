            "text": "Due to their theoretical advantages, hip systems combining modular necks and large diameter femoral heads have gradually gained popularity. However, among others, concerns regarding changes in the load transfer patterns were raised. Recent stress analyses have indeed shown that the use of modular necks and big femoral heads causes significant changes in the strain distribution along the femur. Our original hypothesis was that these changes may affect early distal migration of a modular stem. We examined the effect of head diameter and neck geometry on migration at two years of follow-up in a case series of 116 patients (125 hips), who have undergone primary Metal-on-Metal total hip arthroplasty with the modular grit-blasted Profemur \u00ae E stem combined with large-diameter heads (>36 mm). We found that choice of neck geometry and head diameter has no effect on stem migration. A multivariate regression analysis including the potential confounding variables of the body mass index, bone quality, canal fill and stem positioning revealed only a negative correlation between subsidence and canal fill in midstem area. Statistical analysis, despite its limitations, did not confirm our hypothesis that choice of neck geometry and/or head diameter affects early distal migration of a modular stem. However, the importance of correct stem sizing was revealed."

            "text": "Modern total hip arthroplasty (THA) designs incorporating modular necks and second-generation largediameter Metal-on-Metal (MoM) articulations have been widely implanted worldwide. Due to the increased joint stability and the low-wear characteristics of the wellfunctioning arthroplasties, an extended long-term survivorship rate was anticipated. Thus, they were reserved for the younger and more active patients [1]. However, in predicting longevity, periprosthetic bone remodeling after prosthesis insertion is the most important factor. We know that adaptive bone remodeling is proportional to the magnitude of stress [2]. It is logical to presume that a deviated femoral head, at the coronal or sagittal plane, under an axial load may have different load transfer patterns than when a straight neck is used [3]. Similarly the use of largediameter heads may impose alterations in strain distribution when compared to 28 mm heads.",

            "text": "Only a few papers in recent literature have dealt with the effects of neck modularity and head size on the biomechanics of the hip [3][4][5][6]. According to these stress analyses, the use of modular necks and big femoral heads alters significantly the strains developed along profile lines across the femur and particularly around the stem tip. For the retroverted necks particularly, it seems that the implantation in the anteriorly bowed femur creates increased bending stress and therefore a not so benign scenario for the biomechanical environment [3,4,7]. Furthermore, a finite element analysis (FEA) has shown that for a lateral profile line, along linea aspera and for the stem tip area increasing the head diameter results in strain rise [5]. Although it remains uncertain whether these changes in strain distribution patterns are clinically relevant, they raise concerns regarding adaptive hypertrophy and possible mechanical failure due to increased stress [3]. Mechanical failure and loosening of a femoral stem can be predicted accurately by early measurement of distal migration at two years follow-up [8]. The RSA migration pattern of some cemented stem designs has indeed already been found to be affected by the version of the femoral component [7,9]. Questions are raised over the effect of neck modularity on subsidence of uncemented stems.",

The Profemur \u00ae E stems utilize a patented modular neck technology. Eleven options of neck orientation are available from five different designs (Fig. 2). These five neck versions include a neutral neck, an 8\u00b0 angled neck for varus or valgus, an 8\u00b0 angled neck for anteversion or retroversion, a 15\u00b0 angled neck for anteversion or retroversion, and a neck with a combination of 4\u00b0 for varus and 6\u00b0 for anteversion.

Stem subsidence at two years postoperatively was measured by the two observers, as a change in the vertical distance from the proximal tip of the greater trochanter to the shoulder of the stem [8]. A computer-assisted method was used to perform these measurements. The radiographs were originally DICOM and transformed into TIFF greyscale format without compression. These digital images were processed via Roman v1.7 software (Roman software version V1.70; Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital, Oswestry, UK; http://www.cookedbits.co.uk/roma n/). Roman is a radiological measurement program designed for orthopaedic applications in general. Its accuracy has already been demonstrated for the measurement of polyethylene wear, where the determination of bone and prosthesis landmarks is automated by the computer using an edge detection algorithm [13]. Roman has also been successfully used in stem migration analyses [14].",

CI was calculated at a level 100 mm below the middle of the lesser trochanter and Dorr's bone quality for each patient was assigned [15]. Varus or valgus malalignment of the stem was defined as deviation from the longitudinal femoral axis of > 3\u00b0 on the first postoperative radiograph [16]. On the same radiograph, canal fill at four different levels (calcar, lesser trochanter, midstem, distal fill) was measured [17]. Firstly, lesser trochanter level was defined from a line drawn on the anteroposterior radiograph through the midpoint of the lesser throchanter. Three lines parallel to this were then drawn through the diaphysis. One through the medial margin of the neck osteotomy (calcar level), another through the middle of the stem (midstem level) and the last 100 mm distally, at the stem tip area (distal level). Canal fill was calculated as a percentage of the stem diameter to the endosteal diameter at each level [17]. We defined a stem as undersized when midstem fill was 80% [18].",

            "text": "Although the risk and benefits of systems combining modular necks and large-diameter femoral heads are constantly reevaluated [19,20], interestingly enough, biomechanics of these novel systems have not been equally investigated. Increased femoral anteversion alters significantly loading patterns in monoblock implants, while variations of offset seem to cause only minor changes [21]. For the modular-neck stems and their complex configurations, however, there are only a few reports in the literature [3,4,6]. In a study by Umeda et al. [3] strain gauge measurements of a modular cementless stem implanted in a synthetic femur were performed. Changing the neck from straight to anteverted or retroverted caused a large increase in strains on both, anterior and posterior, femoral surfaces, particularly at the distal part of the stem, and that increase was highly correlated with the extent of neck version. On the aspect toward which the prosthetic neck was oriented increased compressive strains were developed, while on the opposite side increased tensile strains. Due to the anteriorly bowed femur more bending stress was produced, especially at the stem tip area, when retroverted necks were used, as the femoral head deviates more in the sagittal plane than when an anteverted neck is used. The highest value of strain increase, compared with the strain developed with the straight neck, was 1195% and it was recorded with the extensively retro-angled 22.5\u00b0 neck at the anterior aspect of the femur and at the level of the stem tip. It is worth noticing that, for both neck types, strain magnitudes on the anterior and posterior surfaces exceeded those developed on an intact femur [3]. Strains on the medial and lateral aspects of the femur were also increased, but at a lesser magnitude of maximum 22% [3]. Although it is difficult to directly compare results between experimental studies, this increase in the tensile strain on the anterior femoral surface with the retroverted necks was confirmed in another strain gauge study on cadaveric femurs [4]. In the same study, varus neck angulation was found to have a relatively small influence on strain distribution in the proximal femur [4]. In contrast with these studies, a FEA reported no significant alterations in the strain distribution of a cemented stem coupled to a modular neck, positioned in anteversion, retroversion and with two different offsets [6]. However, this study focused only on the medial and lateral femoral aspects. None of these papers examines the changes in strain pattern caused by simultaneous alteration of neckshaft angle, neck length and version. On the other hand, only one study addresses the effect of increasing head size in proximal femur loading [5]. Although one anticipates that head diameter would not affect the strain pattern of the implant [4], this FEA revealed notable changes [5]. With respect to the reference model of a 28 mm femoral head, changing head diameter in 10 mm increments invoked proportional increases of about 15 to 18% in the maximum strains developed around the stem tip, and along linea aspera and a lateral profile line [5]. Whether these changes in loading patterns are associated with clinical problems remains uncertain. We know that bone remodeling after implantation is proportional to the magnitude of stress applied [2]. The increased strain induced by the increased offset and altered neck angles could theoretically act beneficially in preservation of proximal bone stock in vivo, minimizing proximal femur stressshielding. However, as the postarthroplasty neck version becomes excessive, the anterior and posterior femoral regions are exposed to noticeably great stresses, with strain values exceeding several times, not only those developed with straight necks, but also those of unoperated femurs [3]. Although none of the existing papers [3 -6] examines the scenario, we assume that a neck with reduced neck-shaft angle and increased length, implanted in retroversion and coupled with a big femoral head, would lead to even greater strain concentration. There is a concern that subsequent changes in bone quality, due to adaptive remodeling, may have undesirable long-term effects on the stability of the implant and, thus, may limit the life-span of THA [4]. Furthermore, these extended stresses at the implant-bone interface seem likely to raise the risk of implant loosening [21]. A latest report from the Australian Joint Registry has shown indeed a significant higher revision rate for modularneck stems, with aseptic loosening identified as the predominant reason [22]. Similarly, higher revision rates due to loosening/lysis were recorded for large-diameter MoM THAs (>32 mm), compared to those with smaller bearings [22].",

            "text": "Loosening of a femoral stem, though, can be predicted by measurement of distal migration at two years follow-up [8]. Distal stem migration might be, therefore, affected by the parameters of head size, neck version and femoral offset. In a previous RSA study of cemented THA, it was already found that, for some stem designs, anteversion is negatively associated with subsidence [9]. In light of these, we measured early migration in a series of 125 uncemented modular-neck MoM THAs, focusing on the behavior of retroverted necks. A multivariate analysis, including several potential confounding variables, however, has shown that no specific neck geometry resulted in increased migration. Retroverted necks, in particular, have not presented significant differences in subsidence, when compared with straight necks. Similarly, increasing head diameter did not also seem to affect stem subsidence and this agrees with recent EBRA studies [20]. The results revealed only a negative association between migration and midstem fill, independent of the other covariates. This finding goes along with the intention of stem's design for metaphyseal press-fit.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First of all, the number of patients receiving a retroverted neck was limited. This was due to two reasons. Firstly, as these systems were reserved for the younger and more active patients, the overall number of patients enrolled was relative small for the neck options available. Secondly, it was inapplicable to randomise patients to the neck type, because this would have endangered joint stability. As posterior approach was used in all cases, it was fairly uncommon to use a retroverted neck to adjust femoral component version. Certain neck options (retroversion-valgus and retroversion 15\u00b0) were only used twice, thus safe conclusions could not be made from a separate analysis. For this reason we performed an initial univariate analysis excluding these cases ( Table 1) and then grouped patients with a retroverted neck into a single group and proceeded to further steps. The most incriminated combination of strain rise, retroversion-varus, was examined in the univariate analysis. Limited number of patients was the reason for another premise. To avoid further subdividing of the sample, we intentionally ignored the variable of neck length; femoral offset was determined only by changes of the neck-shaft angle. Consequently, our preliminary results should be interpreted with caution; negative results may be related to the limitation of the series. Despite, however, the small sample size, the strength of this study lies in that it is a single-institution, single-surgeon study and that the same implants were used in all patients. Thus, migration could not be influenced by design or surgeon related factors.",

Although literature is unfavorable with retroverted necks, statistical analysis of our series, despite its limitations, failed to reveal an association of migration with retroverted or any other neck type whatsoever. Similarly, head diameter could not be related to subsidence in our series. The higher incidence of reported aseptic loosening of modular-neck stems and large-diameter MoM bearings is not confirmed in the preliminary analysis of our short-term follow-up series. "
