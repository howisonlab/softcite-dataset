Therefore, we investigated the phytochemical properties and biological activity of this parasitic plant to provide essential preliminary scientific evidence to support and encourage its further pharmaceutical research and development. The major plant components were chromatographically isolated using high-performance liquid chromatography and their structures were elucidated using tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance anlysis. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory activity of the 70% ethanol extract of K. japonica (KJ) and its isolated components was evaluated using a nitric oxide (NO) assay and western blot analysis for inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Three flavone di-C-glycosides, lucenin-2, vicenin-2, and stellarin-2 were identified as major components of KJ, for the first time. KJ significantly inhibited NO production and reduced iNOS and COX-2 expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells at 100 mg/ mL while similar activity were observed with isolated flavone C-glycosides. In conclusion, KJ has a simple secondary metabolite profiles including flavone di-C-glycosides as major components and has a strong potential for further research and development as a source of therapeutic anti-inflammatory agents.",

            "text": "Camellia mistletoe, Korthalsella japonica (Thunb.) Engl. (Loranthaceae), a parasitic plant that grows on the stems and branches of Camellia japonica L., Ilex integra (Thunb.), and Vaccinium bracteatum (Thunb.), is distributed throughout Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, China, and India (Kim, 2007). This mistletoe species has a cactus-like morphology, grows up to 15 cm in length, and has a flat appearance. This species has branches that are internodes to opposite with various lengths and their degraded leaves are quite small and arranged in a snake scale-like pattern in two ranks (Devkota and Joshi, 2008). The phytochemical constituents of Camellia mistletoe are not as well known as those of other species, and a few reports have identified the presence of chrysoeriol-4\u02bc-Oglucoside, fatty acids, phytosterol, and oleanolic acid (Fukunaga et al., 1989;Hayashi et al., 1996). The extensive evaluation of other mistletoe species, especially Viscum album L. var. coloratum has revealed various biological activities including antitumor, antihypertensive, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidative, and cardiac effects (Hayashi et al., 1996;Karagoz et al., 2003). However, the biological activity of Camellia mistletoe has not been reported yet.",

            "text": "Inflammation is part of the immune response of tissues to various stimuli (Fontes et al., 2015). The inflammatory process is associated with the activation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, which release inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide (NO), cytokines, and chemokines (de la Fuente et al., 2012). Among these mediators, NO is an important cellular molecule, which is involved in various inflammatory processes including cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as the stimulation of numerous proteins and enzymes that are crucial for mediating inflammatory reactions (Predonzani et al., 2015;Schwentker et al., 2002). Furthermore, NO production is known to be regulated by inducible NO synthase (iNOS), which is the enzyme that catalyzes the production of NO from L-arginine (Koppula et al., 2012;Grimm et al., 2013). Another key enzyme involved in the inflammatory process is the pro-inflammatory cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, which produces prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) that mediates numerous biological functions such as the regulation of immune responses and blood pressure (Seibert and Masferrer, 1994;Murakami and Ohigashi, 2007). Inflammation is known to be associated with degenerative brain diseases, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer (Dubois, 2015). Therefore, the evaluation of the anti-inflammatory efficacy of natural products has become a frequent inclusion and choice in bioassays associated with drug research and development.",

The UV/Vis spectra of the three major peaks were characterized with two absorption maxima around 270 and 350 nm that are characteristic of flavonoids (Fig. 1A). The chromatogram of the chemical profile of the total KJ was relatively simple and the three flavonoid-like compounds were the major components that were identified by the peak heights and areas of the three peaks. When the Biomol Ther 24(6), 630-637 (2016)   were elucidated by comparing their physicochemical data including UV/Vis spectra, MS and MS/MS data, and 1 H-NMR spectra with those previously described in the literature (Suzuki et al., 2003;Xie et al., 2003;Erel et al., 2011). The compounds were identified as lucenin-2, vicenin-2, and stellarin-2 (KJ-1, KJ-2, and KJ-3, respectively). The 1 H-NMR showed signal broadening at an ambient temperature owing to the limited rotation of the C-glycosidic bond, which was sterically hindered by the bulky ortho-substituents and, therefore, the experiments were performed at an elevated temperature of 60\u00b0C to improve spectral resolution (Kumazawa et al., 2001). Compound 1 (KJ-1) was obtained as a dark green amorphous powder and the ESI-TOF-MS gave the molecular formula C27H30O16. The UV/Vis spectrum of KJ-1 showed absorption maxima at 269.8 and 349.6 nm in CH3CN while the MS/ MS spectra in the negative ionization mode showed the de-  (Fig. 1B-1). The cross-ring cleavage of the hexose residue of the C-glycoside yielded numerous characteristic product ions such as m/z [(M-H)-90] -, [(M-H)-120]losses pattern (Vukics and Guttman, 2010). The MS/MS results suggest the presence of a luteolin (286)+hexose (162)+hexose (162) structure. The 1 H NMR at 60\u00b0C revealed a 3\u02bc,4\u02bc,5,7tetra-hydroxyl-substituted flavone from the aromatic spin systems: \u03b4H 7.43 (s), 6.83 (d, J=8.1 Hz), and 7.46 (d, J=8.0 Hz), corresponding to H-2\u02bc, H-5\u02bc, and H-6\u02bc, respectively, and \u03b4H 6.57 (s) corresponding to H-3 ( Table 2). The hexosides were assigned as C-\u03b2-D-glucosides because the characteristic chemical shift and coupling constant were identical with that found in the literature (Erel et al., 2011). The hexoside linkage was also assigned to C-6 and C-8 because the vicinal coupling constants were 8.0-9.7 Hz, including the anomeric protons at \u03b4H 4.75 (d, J=9.6 Hz) of 6-C-\u03b2-Glc and \u03b4H 4.86 (d, J=9.7 Hz) of 8-C-\u03b2-Glc, and H-2\u02bc\u02bc at \u03b4H 3.77 (brs) of 6-C-\u03b2-Glc and \u03b4H 3.74 (brs) of 8-C-\u03b2-Glc. Therefore, compound 1 was elucidated as luteolin 6,8-di-C-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (lucenin-2).",

RAW 264.7 cell stimulated with LPS (1 mg/ mL) exhibited a significant increase in NO production up to 62.6 \u00b1 0.7 mM from the basal level of 0.18 \u00b1 0.1 mM (1\u00d710 5 cells/mL in a 12-well plate, n=6). As shown in Fig. 2B, the highdose groups (10 and 100 mg/mL) of KJ showed a significant reduction in NO production (11.6 and 71.7%, respectively) compare to the LPS-stimulated group. However, KJ reduced NO production by only 1.8% at the low dose of 1 mg/mL. Dexamethasone (1 mg/mL) as the positive control also inhibited NO production significantly and the potency was slightly less than that of KJ 100 mg/mL. Considering that KJ is a crude plant extract, which likely contains a mixture of numerous metabolites, the anti-inflammatory efficacy of KJ was relatively comparable to that of dexamethasone. Two key enzymes involved in the inflammatory process, iNOS and COX-2, were quantitated using western blot analysis to evaluate the inhibitory effects of KJ on their expression. Compare to the negative control, the LPS-stimulated group showed significantly increased levels of iNOS and COX-2 (Fig. 2C). Compared with the LPS-stimulated group, the expression of iNOS was significantly reduced only in the 100 mg/ mL KJ group to 42.9%. In contrast, COX-2 was significantly reduced in all KJ-treated groups (1, 10, and 100 mg/mL) with rates of 12.6, 35.3, and 75.1%, respectively. Dexamethasone (1 mg/mL) also reduced iNOS and COX-2 expression to 66.2 and 69.5%, respectively. The results showed that the antiinflammatory activity of KJ was directly linked to the inhibition of the expression these two key enzymes involved in NO production and inflammatory responses. Further investigations of other mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory activity of KJ need to be performed including determination of the possible involvement of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) activation and modulation by its subunit (Surh et al., 2001).",

As shown in Fig 3A, none of the flavone C-glycosides showed any significant cytotoxicity up to a concentration of 100 mg/ mL. Furthermore, all three flavone C-glycosides significantly inhibited NO production at 100 mg/mL while KJ-2 and KJ-3 showed concentration-dependency (Fig. 3B). Although the flavone glycosides did not show a higher potency than the crude KJ did, their significant inhibition of NO production and relative contents in the UPLC chromatogram suggests that these flavone C-glycosides are active principles of Camellia mistletoe.",

The 70% ethanol extract of K. japonica showed a simple chemical profile in the UPLC analysis. The major components and active principles of KJ were identified as the flavone di-C-glucosides, lucenin-2, vicenin-2, and stellarin-2. Flavonoid C-glycosides have chemical structures with highly polar sugar portions and phenolic hydroxyl groups. However, it was previously demonstrated that these compounds could be absorbed unchanged and underwent enterohepatic recirculation in addition to hydrolysis, reduction, and conjugation to form a bioavailable glucuronide (Angelino et al., 2013). Previous studies on the biological efficacy of isolated flavonoid C-glycosides have shown antibacterial activity (Sorbo et al., 2004), antioxidant property (Barreca et al., 2011), anti-inflammatory activity (Erel et al., 2011), and anti-hepa-  Fig. 3.

However, anti-inflammatory activity of these compounds against NO pathway was revealed for the first time in this study. Our investigation of the biological activity of KJ revealed that the treatment with this extract significantly inhibited NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW cells. NO is one of the main inflammatory mediators and has important functions as a signaling molecule in various physiological processes (Schwentker et al., 2002). Therefore, based on its obvious effects on NO production, KJ can be considered as a potential natural resource for the development of anti-inflammatory agents. Moreover, the significant inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 expression by KJ confirmed the biological efficacy of this unfamiliar mistletoe species on various inflammatory mediators, and possibly against associated disease. Collectively, these results suggest that Camellia mistletoe has the potential to be the source of active compounds for development as useful pharmaceutical agents targeting inflammatory diseases.",
