In this study, the INHBB gene was knocked down by three RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ-ZsGreen vector-mediated recombinant plasmids to explore the effects of INHBB silencing on granulosa cell (GC) cell cycle, apoptosis and steroid production in vitro. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, flow cytometry and ELISA were performed to evaluate the role of INHBB in the mouse GC cell cycle, apoptosis and steroid production in vitro. The results showed that the relative mRNA and protein expression of INHBB in mouse GCs can be significantly reduced by RNAi with pshRNA-B1, pshRNA-B2 and pshRNA-B3 plasmids, with pshRNA-B3 having the best knockdown efficiency. Downregulation of the expression of INHBB significantly arrests cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and increases the apoptosis rate in GCs. This was further confirmed by downregulation of the protein expressions of Cyclin D1, Cyclin E and Bcl2, while the protein expression of Bax was upregulated. In addition, specific downregulation of INHBB markedly decreased the concentration of estradiol and progesterone, which was further validated by the decrease in the mRNA levels of CYP19A1and CYP11A1. These findings suggest that inhibin \u03b2B is important in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle progression in granulosa cells. Furthermore, the inhibin \u03b2B subunit has a role in the regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis. Evidence is accumulating to support the concept that inhibin \u03b2B is physiologically essential for early folliculogenesis in the mouse.",

            "text": "F ollicular development and atresia in the mammalian ovaries is regulated by the cross talk between death and cell survival signals, including endocrine hormones and intraovarian regulators [1]. The fate of a follicle is dependent on a delicate balance in the expression and actions of factors promoting follicular cell proliferation, growth and differentiation and of those inducing apoptosis [1,2]. Granulosa cells (GCs) produce steroids, sense follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in the ovarian microenvironment and promote growth of delicate oocytes. Therefore, cultured ovarian GCs are essential models for elucidating underlying molecular mechanisms of gene regulation during folliculogenesis [3].",

            "text": "Inhibins and activins are structurally related dimeric glycoprotein hormones initially characterized by their ability to suppress and stimulate, respectively, FSH secretion by the pituitary gland. Inhibins are heterodimers of a common \u03b1 subunit and one of the two distinct, homologous, \u03b2 chains (\u03b2A or \u03b2B), whereas activins are hetero-or homodimers consisting of two \u03b2 subunits [4]. All these subunits are products of separate genes [5]. Inhibin beta B, also known as INHBB, is a protein encoded by the INHBB gene. INHBB is a subunit of both activin and inhibin, two closely related glycoproteins with opposing biological effects. Inhibins are produced mainly by the GCs and act as endocrine hormones that are released into the circulation to suppress pituitary FSH production [6,7]. From the growing pool of knowledge regarding inhibins, the emerging data support the hypothesis that beta A and beta B subunits are functionally different [8]. Inhibin can negatively regulate the effects of activin by preventing its binding to the activin receptor at the cell membrane and blocks the activation of downstream signal transduction pathways [9,10]. Recently, the relative expression levels of the inhibin \u03b1, \u03b2A and \u03b2B subunits were determined in postnatal rat GCs [11]. FSH stimulates the secretion of inhibin by GCs of the ovarian follicles, ultimately leading to the suppression of FSH via inhibin [12]. Inhibin and FSH are regulated by a feedback mechanism; thus a decrease in inhibin promotes FSH secretions that ultimately increase the chances of fertilization [13]. In this context, domestic ruminants have been immunized against inhibin vaccines, leading to higher ovulation rates in sheep, goats, cattle and pigs [14][15][16][17][18][19][20].",

Three target sites were selected according to an RNAi program [31], and their specificity was further confirmed through a BLAST search. The typical structure of short hairpin RNA has been previously described [27]. The two complementary oligonucleotides of this short hairpin structure were annealed and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQZsGreen Vector (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). These plasmids were named pshRNA-B1, pshRNA-B2 and pshRNA-B3, respectively (Table  1). On the other hand, a plasmid with a non-specific sequence was used as a negative control (pshRNA-negative) and was described elsewhere [27]. These recombinant plasmids vectors independently express a Zoanthus sp. green fluorescent protein, engineered for brighter fluorescence (excitation maximum = 496 nm; emission maximum = 506 nm), and as result, transfected cells emit green fluorescent protein (GFP).",

We transiently knocked down INHBB gene in primary mouse granulosa cells, which highly expresses INHBB. The results demonstrated that knockdown of the INHBB gene by RNAi vectors downregulated both the mRNA and protein expression of INHBB in mouse granulosa cells. This result indicates that INHBB RNAi expression plasmids were successfully constructed and transfected into mouse granulosa cells.",

The results showed that the G1 phase of the cell cycle was significantly arrested compared with the control. In the present Three (3) groups of INHBB RNAi recombinant plasmids were transfected in mouse GCs named as pshRNA-B1, pshRNA-B2, pshRNA-B3 and pshRNA-negative. After 48 h, the expression of GFP in the recombinant plasmids were shown, which implied that INHBB recombinant plasmids could be high efficiently expressed in mouse GCs. The best efficient RNAi vector (pshRNA-B3) was selected for further investigation.  study, GCs after INHBB knockdown showed decreased protein levels of cyclin D1 and Cyclin E, which are the key regulators of the cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 phase to S phase [33,34]. We believe that INHBB has the potential to affect GC development by regulating the cell cycle progression from G1 phase to S phase to modulate ovarian function. In a previous study, INHA was also found to be involved in Sertoli cell progression in the mouse [27]. Taken together, these results indicate that INHBB is important in control of the cell cycle in mouse GCs. Folliculogenesis in mammals includes follicular growth and follicular atresia. Follicular growth involves proliferation, cell cycle control and differentiation of GCs. However, only a few follicles reach the ovulation stage, and most follicles are lost before ovulation due to atresia. This degenerative process is initiated or caused by apoptosis of granulosa cells. It is well established that the cross talk between cell death and survival signals is very important for follicular development, and whether the follicle ultimately ovulates or undergoes degeneration is dependent on the multiple ovarian factors that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Previous studies in rat have demonstrated that INHA increases apoptosis in early ovarian antral follicles treated with diethylstilbestrol [35]. Recently, it was found that miR-34a plays an important role in granulosa cell apoptosis by targeting the INHBB gene in the porcine ovary [36]. Based on these studies, we predicted that INHBB knockdown might reduce cell survivability by increasing apoptosis in mouse GCs. In support of this, our results showed that INHBB knockdown induced apoptosis in mouse GCs. Moreover, we found an increase in protein level of BAX and a decrease in protein level of BCL-2 after INHBB downregulation. Members of the BCL-2 gene family, such as BAX and BCL-2, play key roles in regulating apoptosis, which is the process of self-destruction of cells under physiological conditions [37]. In the female gonads the roles of the BCL-2 family members and BAX in apoptosis have been extensively studied, and they are   Values represent the mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3). All results were evaluated by one-way ANOVA. An asterisk (*) indicates the level of significance within columns (P < 0.05). regarded as key factors in initiating or preventing apoptosis in female germ cells [38]. Overexpression of BAX accelerates the apoptotic death response to death signals [39]. These findings confirmed that INHBB knockdown increased the apoptosis rate in mouse GCs. The major functions of granulosa cells include the production of sex steroids as well as a myriad of growth factors thought to interact with the oocyte during its development. The sex steroid production consists of FSH stimulating granulosa cells to convert androgens (coming from the thecal cells) to estradiol by aromatase during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle [40]. Therefore, culture of ovarian GCs is an essential model for studying the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation during folliculogenesis. Follicular development is a complex biological process regulated by various intrinsic factors, especially estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). In our culture system, INHBB silencing significantly reduced the concentrations of estradiol and progesterone in the culture medium of the pshRNA-B3 group compared with the control group. The lower levels of these two hormones might be due to the lower mRNA level of CYP11A1 caused by INHBB knockdown, which is responsible for initiation of the steroidogenesis cascade in the ovary [41] and the decrease in CYP19A1 mRNA level, the enzyme responsible for androgen aromatization to estrogen [42].",

This was further confirmed by the associative apoptotic and cell cycle factors. Furthermore, the inhibin \u03b2B subunit has a role in the regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis.
