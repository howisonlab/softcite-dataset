Here we report the systematic investigation of paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic and tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transitions of ''122'' SrFe 2 As 2 parent compound using combined high resolution synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction techniques in a cryogenically cooled high pressure diamond anvil cell. It is found that although the two transitions are coupled at 205 K at ambient pressure, they are concurrently suppressed to much lower temperatures near a quantum critical pressure of approximately 4.8 GPa where the antiferromagnetic state transforms into bulk superconducting state. Our results indicate that the lattice distortions and magnetism jointly play a critical role in inducing superconductivity in iron based compounds.",

            "text": "he recent discovery of superconductivity in iron pnictide compounds 1 has drawn significant attention in studying the unconventional superconductivity containing magnetic elements. Following the first report on the superconductivity in ''1111'' RFeAsO system, a number of pnictide families have been reported including ''122'' AeFe 2 As 2 (Ae 5 Ca, Sr, Ba), ''111'' AFePn (A: Li, Na, Pn: As, P), and ''11'' FeSe types [2][3][4] . The parent compounds of the iron pnictide superconductors contain FeAs tetrahedral layers and exhibit a tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition as well as a paramagnetic (PM) to antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition 5,6 . The AFM orthorhombic phase has been shown to be the parent phase of the pnictide superconductor forming the spin density wave (SDW) state in which superconductivity can be induced by suppressing the SDW state via chemical doping or applied pressure 7,8 . The structural and magnetic phase transitions of the pnictide parent compounds have been shown to play an important role in inducing superconductivity 9 . For example, previous studies have indicated that ''122'' SrFe 2 As 2 compound undergoes the structural and magnetic transitions simultaneously at T S 5 205 K at ambient pressure 10,11 , while its superconductivity (SC) occurs once the SDW state is suppressed at high pressures 12 . On the other hand, chemical substitutions with electron or hole doping have been shown to suppress the AFM state of SrFe 2 As 2 , resulting in the occurrence of superconductivity even at ambient pressure 13,14 . The correlation between the suppression of the long-range magnetic ordering and the simultaneous formation of the SC state indicates that the spin fluctuation of the Fe moments plays a key role in establishing the superconductive state. Compared to chemical doping where disorders can be inevitably introduced 15,16 , applied pressure introduces less lattice disorders than chemical doping, and has been shown to be an effective tool in deciphering the intrinsic superconducting behaviors in Fe-based superconductors 17,18 . Indeed, applied pressure not only increases the T C in the LaFeAs(O 12x F x ), FeSe, AFePn (A: Li, Na, Pn: As, P) system [19][20][21][22][23] , but it also induces superconductivity in the parent ''122'' compounds [24][25][26][27] . Superconductivity with high T C up to 12 K appears at pressures between 0.23 and 0.86 GPa in CaFe 2 As 2",

Since the magnetic transition is strongly coupled with the structural distortion in the SrFe 2 As 2 system at ambient pressure, studying its magnetic ordering, structural distortions, and superconductivity at high pressures and low temperatures under controlled hydrostatic conditions can provide valuable insight into intrinsic underlying mechanism for the origin of superconductivity in the system. Here we have investigated the magnetic and structural transitions of SrFe 2 As 2 using synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer spectoscopy (SMS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) in a cryogenically-cooled high-pressure diamond anvil cell (DAC) having a relatively hydrostatic Ne pressure medium. Our results show that the magnetic and structural transitions of SrFe  57 Fe nuclear level through hyperfine interaction, showing the AFM state. As pressure was increased to 4.3 GPa, the SMS spectrum changed significantly with the disappearance of the quantum beats, indicating that the magnetic phase had been suppressed via applied pressure at 15 K while the PM state started to appear. Since the spectrum could not be reasonably fitted using only paramagnetic or magnetic phases, both paramagnetic and magnetic phases were used to model the SMS spectrum at 4.3 GPa. Analyses of the modeled results showed that the magnetic phase accounts for approximately 42 vol.% of the two phases. At a higher pressure of approximately 5.4 GPa, the 57 Fe nuclear level is characterized by flat spectral features without any splitting quantum beats, indicating the sole existence of the PM state with the completely suppressed magnetism by pressure. The derived hyperfine parameters show an abrupt increase in the strength of the magnetic fields as a function of temperature at a given pressure ( Fig. 1(b)). For example, at 2.5 GPa the hyperfine magnetic field  jumped to 6.7 T from zero as temperature was decreased to 160 K and then remains almost constant, indicating a PM to AFM transition. As pressure increases ( Fig. 1(b)), the hyperfine magnetic field decreases and the magnetic transition region slightly broadens, implying suppressed magnetism by applied pressure; magnetism was totally suppressed at 5.1 GPa at each given low temperature as shown in Fig. 1(c). In order to clarify the relationship between the structural and magnetic transitions, we have also performed XRD experiments under high pressures and low temperatures (Figs. 2). Analyses of the high-pressure XRD spectra showed that the (220) reflection of the tetragonal phase splits to (400) and (040) reflections that are characteristic of the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition in SrFe 2 As 2 with decreasing temperature at a given pressure 11 . Similar to the magnetic transition, this structural transition is strongly suppressed by pressure ( Fig. 2(a)). At a constant temperature of 13 K, derived lattices parameters in Fig. 2(b) show the existence of the orthorhombic phase (space group: Fmmm) below 4 GPa and the tetragonal phase (space group: I4/mmm) above 6 GPa, respectively, whereas there is a P-T region between 4 GPa and 6 GPa, in which the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases coexist. With increasing pressure, the orthorhombic phase observed in the region is suppressed while the abundance of the tetragonal phase is enhanced (Fig. 2(c)).",

The magnetic transition temperature (T N ) was defined as the mid-point between the first appearance of the hyperfine magnetic field and the last appearance of the paramagnetic phase, while the structural transition temperature (T S ) was defined as the mid-point from the pure tetragonal to the pure orthorhombic structural phase transition; for the co-existence of the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases at 13 K, the T S is defined as the point of disappearance for the orthorhombic phase. At ambient pressure, previous studies showed that the structural transition concurs with the magnetic transition 10,11 . Our results here further show that, within experimental uncertainties, these two transitions are strongly coupled at high pressures and low temperatures (Fig. 3), except the P-T region overlap starting with the T c dome where an extended P-T region of the two-phase coexistence was observed (see further details in Discussions). These transition temperatures decrease with increasing pressures up to approximately 4.6 GPa, but are drastically suppressed to zero at a quantum critical pressure (P C ) of 4.8 GPa.",

            "text": "As discussed in the previous studies of the ''122'' system, differential stress can strongly affect the critical pressure in the BaFe 2 As 2 and SrFe 2 As 2 compounds [29][30][31] . In order to draw a more direct, meaningful comparison with literature results, our structural and magnetic results are plotted on top of the superconducting transition from Ref. 25 , which reported electrical resistivity and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements using a relatively hydrostatic glycerin medium that is similar in hydrostaticity to Ne medium used in our experiments. Comparisons of these results show that filamentary superconductivity with zero resistivity emerges with the occurrence of the tetragonal phase co-existing with the orthorhombic phase in the AFM state at around 4.2 GPa and 13 K. Our results also imply that filamentary superconductivity can only coexist with the partial magnetism in the mixed tetragonal and orthorhombic region in the SrFe 2 As 2 at temperatures below 28 K and pressures between 4.2 and 4.8 GPa as shown in the filled purple region in Fig. 3. Furthermore, bulk superconductivity, as observed by an anomaly in the field cooling (FC) magnetic susceptibility, only appears in the P-T region with the tetragonal phase in the PM state, where the T S and T N transitions are fully suppressed. Based on both diffraction and M\u00f6ssbauer results, the volume fraction of the AFM orthorhombic phase as a function of pressure appears to be inversely proportional to the high T c (Figs. 2 and 3), further supporting the notion that the superconductivity is partially suppressed by the existence of magnetism in the AFM orthorhombic phase. Thus we assume the presence of an AFM quantum critical point (QCP) near the AFM phase boundary. Previous NMR experiments indicate an antiferromagnetic fluctuation associated with QCP has strong correlation with the high-T c superconductivity in chemically-doped BaFe 2 As 2 compounds 32,33 . These results indicate that the QCP is likely to connect with the superconductivity in the iron based compound.",

XRD analyses of the synthesized samples showed lattice parameters of a 5 3.9234(3) \u00c5 and c 5 12.371(2) \u00c5 at ambient conditions. A sample measuring 15 mm thick and 70 mm big was loaded into a symmetric DAC using Ne as the pressure medium, together with three ruby spheres for pressure calibration at low temperatures. The pressure of the sample chamber was controlled using a membrane diaphragm. A helium flow cold-finger cryostat was used to cool down the DAC to as low as 10 K; temperatures of the DAC were equilibrated after each cooling and were measured using two thermocouples attached to each side of the DAC. Temperature uncertainties were less than 5 K. SMS measurements with a resonant energy (E 0 ) of 14.4125 keV for 57 Fe were performed at the undulator beamline 16-IDD of the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The energy band-width of the undulator beam was monochromotized to approximately 2 meV bandwidth using a water-cooled diamond (1 1 1) double crystal monochromator and a high resolution monochromator consisting of 2 channel cut silicon crystals (Si(4 4 0) and Si(9 7 5)). A pair of KB mirrors was used to focus the x-ray beam to approximately 50 mm at the sample position in the DAC. SMS spectra were collected using an avalanche photodiode detector at the nuclear forward scattering geometry with a collection time of 1-2 hours. SMS spectra were collected in the form of the intensity of the 57 Fe nuclear decay as a function of time. When the nuclei in the sample are excited by the synchrotron radiation pulse of 14.4125 meV with a bandwidth of 11 meV, the coherent decay of the excited ensemble of nuclei phases with time. Through analyses of the time-resolved intensity of the SMS spectra, hyperfine parameters, including hyperfine magnetic fields, containing structural and electronic information of the resonating nucleus can be derived. The high resolution (DE/E , 1*10 27 ) of the SMS technique enables us to detect the AFM to PM phase transition of SrFe 2 As 2 at high pressures. The spectra were fitted using the CONUSS program 35 to derive hyperfine parameters including hyperfine magnetic fields of the Fe ions.",

XRD measurements of the starting sample showed consistent lattice parameters to the single crystals. To avoid systematic errors, care was taken to ensure that experimental conditions between SMS and XRD experiments were consistent: the same cryostat with the same temperature thermocouples and membrane controller were used in both experiments. Two types of XRD experiments were conducted: decreasing temperatures at a constant pressure with an x-ray wavelength of 0.4072 \u00c5 ; increasing pressures at a constant temperature of 50 K or 13 K with an x-ray wavelength of 0.3737 \u00c5 .
