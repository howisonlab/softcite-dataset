Recent studies have assessed the three-dimensional (3D) co-localization of functional annotations (e.g. centromeres, long terminal repeats) using 3D genome reconstructions from Hi-C (genome-wide chromosome conformation capture) data; however, corresponding assessments for continuous functional genomic data (e.g. chromatin immunoprecipitationsequencing (ChIP-seq) peak height) are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that applying bump hunting via the patient rule induction method (PRIM) to ChIPseq data superposed on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3D genome reconstruction can discover 'functional 3D hotspots', regions in 3-space for which the mean ChIP-seq peak height is significantly elevated. For the transcription factor Swi6, the top hotspot by Pvalue contains MSB2 and ERG11-known Swi6 target genes on different chromosomes. We verify this finding in a number of ways. First, this top hotspot is relatively stable under PRIM across parameter settings. Second, this hotspot is among the top hotspots by mean outcome identified by an alternative algorithm, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) regression. Third, the distance between MSB2 and ERG11 is smaller than expected (by resampling) in two other 3D reconstructions generated via different normalization and reconstruction algorithms. This analytic approach can discover functional 3D hotspots and potentially reveal novel regulatory interactions.",

While visualization of such architecture remains limited to lowresolution, low-throughput, targeted techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (4), the ability to infer genome architecture at high resolution has been enabled by recently-devised assays derived from chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques (5). In particular, when coupled with next generation sequencing, such methods (hereafter termed Hi-C (6,7)) yield an inventory of genome-wide chromatin interactions which, in turn, provide a basis for reconstructing 3D chromatin configuration, as described below. Here, we use such 3D reconstructions to discover 'functional 3D hotspots' in the nucleus (e.g. transcription factories) (8)(9)(10).",

Centromeres, telomeres and long terminal repeats were detected as significantly co-localized in S. cerevisiae (17). Interestingly, in P. falciparum, sets of genes with developmentally regulated expression were detected as significantly co-localized in 3D-reconstruction-based assessments but not in contact-based assessments (17). This finding illustrates a potential advantage of 3D reconstructions: they enable the detection of multi-level co-localizations (i.e. of multiple (inter)chromosomal regions), whereas the contact data are inherently limited to detecting strictly pairwise colocalization. In other words, 3D reconstruction-based analyses may detect if a set of marks occupies a smaller subset of the nucleus than expected by chance even if the set is not enriched for individual pairs of marks that are exceptionally close together. Another advantage of the 3D reconstruction is that for genomic regions that have missing contact data their position in the 3D reconstruction can be inferred from neighboring genomic regions via chromatin contiguity. Furthermore, superposition of genomic locus-indexed attributes onto 3D reconstructions can be readily and naturally performed, as we subsequently illustrate. For contact level data, such overlay is less immediate again due to the contact data's pairwise structure.",

Further, focal assessments of continuous outcome provide a potential advantage over focal assessments of marks. For the previous analyses of marks (e.g. target genes), the target genes to be tested for co-localization had to be specified from the outset. In contrast, the analytic approaches that we advance for continuous outcomes can discover functional co-localizations without target genes being pre-specified. Rather, these techniques analyze genomeindexed signals superposed on 3D reconstructions and discover putative hotspots, which are then subjected to down-stream biological analyses (e.g. gene membership). As such, the approaches detailed here may detect novel interactions for which the interacting target genes are not known a priori. The functional outcomes that we analyze here derive from ChIP-seq as mentioned; however, the methods can be applied irrespective of outcome type.",

We converted the raw sequencing SRA data to FASTQ format using 'fastq-dump' version 2.3.4 in the sequence read archive (SRA) Toolkit (26). We aligned the reads to the S. cerevisiae reference genome (sacCer2) using Bowtie 2 (27) version 2.2.1 with default parameters and then converted the sequence alignment / map (SAM) output to binary alignment / map (BAM) format using SAMtools (28) version 0.1.19-44428cd. We filtered the sequencing reads (using the R package 'ShortRead' (29) version 1.20.0 with a custom filter) to retain only those with two or less expected errors per read: given a Phred quality score q for each base call, the probability that a base call is erroneous is P = 10 (\u2212 q / 10) , which is then summed over the bases in the read to give the expected errors per read. Using 'ShortRead' (29), we deduplicated the reads to control for PCR amplification bias (30,31) and masked the highly repetitive chromosome XII rDNA region (via a custom filter) because of the difficulty of aligning short reads there. We log 2 -normalized each ChIP-seq sample to the mock IP control using the function get.smoothed.enrichment.mle() in the R package 'spp' (32) version 1.11 with a 200 basepair (bp) bandwidth and 100 bp stepsize.

We then assigned to each bead the most extreme ChIP-seq peak height (positive or negative) from the bin centered on that bead. The result is a 3D chromatin configuration reconstruction overlaid with functional genomic data: each bead now has a genomic position, physical coordinates (X,Y,Z) and a ChIP-seq peak height value. We visualized this superposed 3D reconstruction in MacPy-MOL 1.3 (34) by first converting the data to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) file format (35) with the ChIP-seq peak height value rescaled as the temperature factor (B-factor) in the PDB file.",

After applying PRIM, each bead in the superposed 3D reconstruction now has a genomic position, physical (X,Y,Z) coordinates, a ChIP-seq peak height value and a numerical PRIM box label (the largest numerical label is a placeholder for the beads that were not boxed). We estimated the significance of all of the PRIM boxes (except for the placeholder) by permutations as follows. We preserved the mapping of beads to PRIM boxes, and then permuted the ChIP-seq peak height along each chromosome. Then, we computed the mean ChIP-seq peak height for each PRIM box from the permuted data. We repeated this for a total of 10 5 permutations. The P-value of each box was estimated by comparing its mean ChIP-seq peak height from the observed data to its mean ChIP-seq peak height values from the permuted data. We ranked these potential 3D hotspots by P-value and Holm-adjusted the P-values to account for multiple testing. To gauge the effect size of the mean ChIP-seq peak height of each hotspot, we also computed Z-scores: the difference between the observed mean outcome and the mean of the mean outcomes across all permutations, divided by the standard deviation of the mean outcomes across all permutations.",

This process is continued until a prescribed minimum number of beads (min beads) remains (we used the smallest setting out of those tested for which inter-chromosomal hotspots could be detected, detailed in 'Methods'). The resultant region can be enlarged to correct potential overshoot by pasting additional beads on to the region (via paste alpha, which is smaller than peel alpha) if that increases the mean ChIP-seq peak height (see 'Methods'). At this point, a PRIM region or 'box' has been identified, which represents a potential 3D hotspot. The beads comprising this box are then excluded and the entire procedure is repeated to identify additional boxes. We performed inference as follows: for each PRIM box, we preserved the beads comprising that box, then permuted ChIPseq peak height values along each chromosome, and computed the mean ChIP-seq peak height of the box with the permuted data to generate a null referent distribution for estimating a P-value (see 'Methods').",

If VTC3 turns out to be a bona fide Swi6 target gene, then the P-value of Swi6 target gene enrichment in this hotspot will be markedly smaller than is currently reported. Thus, the top functional 3D hotspot discovered by applying PRIM to Swi6 ChIP-seq peak height superposed on the 3D reconstruction contains known Swi6 target genes on different chromosomes. We analyzed two additional ChIP-seq inputs (the repressor Tup1 and the active form of RNA polymerase II (18)) separately superposed on the 3D reconstruction ( Supplementary Figures S1-S3) but did not detect significant enrichment of target genes (or gene ontology terms) in the top 3D hotspot of either.

As an initial sensitivity assessment of the top Swi6 3D hotspot containing MSB2 and ERG11 to these specifications, we applied PRIM with alternative parameter settings. We tested the six crossed combinations of three values for peel alpha (0.075, 0.05 or 0.025) and two values for paste alpha (0.025 or 0.01). Encouragingly, for five of the six combinations, the 3D hotspot containing MSB2 and ERG11 was ranked first by P-value (of 548 to 717 potential hotspots) ( Supplementary Table S1). For the other combination, it was ranked 22nd (of 503 potential hotspots). Thus, this top Swi6 3D hotspot is relatively stable across PRIM parameter settings. We also evaluated whether the discovery of this top 3D hotspot was specific to the bead interval of the 3D reconstruction to which PRIM was applied. For this purpose, we generated two down-sampled 3D reconstructions by dropping every 3rd bead or every 2nd bead from the original 3D reconstruction. We superposed the Swi6 ChIPseq peak height on to each of these 3D reconstructions (in doing so the ChIP-seq peak height becomes binned at the same interval as the beads) and then applied PRIM. When the min beads parameter was reduced (from 25 to 15)--consistent with the larger bead intervals (and smaller number of beads in the 3D reconstructions)--the 3D hotspot containing MSB2 and ERG11 was ranked 1st (of 754 potential hotspots) for the 3D reconstruction resulting from dropping every 3rd bead, and was ranked 3rd (of 544 potential hotspots) for the 3D reconstruction resulting from dropping every 2nd bead ( Supplementary Table S2).

In the present setting this may be problematic as the 'covariates'--X, Y and Z axes--have no intrinsic meaning since the 3D reconstruction is coordinate free with no preferred orientation.

Specifically, we assessed the significance of the Euclidean distance between MSB2 and ERG11 via resampling with preservation of the chromosome structure of the data as per (17). We performed this assessment on the 3D reconstruction that was used for hotspot discovery, which was generated via explicit-factor normalization followed by constrained optimization of a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) criterion, the constraints reflecting numerous biologically-based restrictions (7). In addition, we performed this assessment on two 3D reconstructions from (13), which were generated via a different normalization algorithm (iterative correction and eigenvector decomposition (ICE) (39)) followed by differing reconstruction algorithms: an unconstrained MDS optimization and a Poisson regression model (13).",

Examples of transcription factories (or 'regulatory depots') have been described in experimental literature (8,22,23). Previous attempts to utilize Hi-C data to identify such co-localizations (whether from contact level data or from 3D reconstructions) have so far only assessed marks such as centromeres, telomeres and long terminal repeats (11,16,17). Relatedly, Ben-Elazar et al. (49) used a sophisticated approach that adjusts for genomic proximity in assessing 3D spatial co-localization of transcription factor target genes. Here, we made the novel contribution of extending such analyses to continuous functional genomic data. We applied PRIM to Swi6 ChIPseq data superposed on a 3D genome reconstruction and demonstrated that the top-ranked 3D hotspot by P-value contains known Swi6 target genes on different chromosomes. Extensive downstream analyses demonstrated the robustness of this 3D hotspot -it being detected under a range of PRIM parameter settings, 3D reconstruction resolutions, 3D reconstruction rotations and also emergent using an alternative algorithm, k-NN regression. Moreover, the known Swi6 target genes contained in this hotspot, MSB2 and ERG11, are also co-localized under alternate 3D reconstructions.",

As an example of what can be gleaned from the contact level data, a recent study applied hierarchical clustering to the pairwise contacts based on the epigenetic status of the first locus in each pair (54); however, this merely groups together pairs that have the same epigenetic status (of the first locus), regardless of whether the different pairs are physically proximal.",
