            "text": "Background In the evaluation of childhood obesity interventions, few researchers undertake a rigorous feasibility stage in which the design and procedures of the evaluation process are examined. Consequently, phase III studies often demonstrate methodological weaknesses. Purpose Our aim was to conduct a feasibility trial of the evaluation of WATCH IT, a community obesity intervention for children and adolescents. We sought to determine an achievable recruitment rate; acceptability of randomisation, assessment procedures, and dropout rate; optimal outcome measures for the definitive trial; and a robust sample size calculation. Method Our goal was to recruit 70 participants over 6 months, randomise them to intervention or control group, and retain participation for 12 months. Assessments were taken prior to randomisation and after 6 and 12 months. Procedures mirrored those intended for a full-scale trial, but multiple measures of similar outcomes were included as a means to determine those most appropriate for future research. Acceptability of the research and impact of the research on the programme were ascertained through interviewing participants and staff. Results We recruited 70 participants and found that randomisation and data collection procedures were acceptable. Self-referral (via media promotion) was more effective than professional referral. Blinding of assessors was sustained to a reasonable degree, and optimal outcome measures for a full-scale trial were identified. Estimated sample size was significantly greater than sample sized reported in published trials. There was some negative impact on the existing programme as a result of the research, a lesson for designers of future trials. Limitations We successfully recruited socially disadvantaged families, but the majority of families were of White British nationality. The composition of the participants was an added valuable lesson, suggesting that recruitment strategies to obtain a more heterogeneous ethnic sample warrant consideration in future research. Conclusions This study provided us with confidence that we can run a phase III multi-centre trial to test the effectiveness of WATCH IT. Importantly, it was invaluable in informing the design not only of that trial but also of future evaluations of childhood obesity treatment interventions.",

            "text": "The need to intervene to reduce the high prevalence of childhood obesity has prompted policy makers and researchers to identify effective options for its treatment. There remains an uncertainty in the research literature as to the best treatment approach, and there is still a lack of well-designed, robust trials that evaluate the effectiveness of interventions [1]. In the most recent Cochrane review for treatment interventions, there was some agreement that multi-component lifestyle interventions were optimal [1], but there were only a limited number of high-quality studies and few met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Most of the 64 identified studies demonstrated methodological weakness in one or more areas, including inadequate group allocation, lack of blinding, and poorly reported follow-up and dropout rates. Thus, in their bid to find answers, researchers must conduct rigorous evaluations of such complex interventions as set out in the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions [2]. Within this model, feasibility trials are emphasised as essential to examine the viability of conducting definitive trials and to ensure that necessary refinements can be made to interventions and study procedures. Such protocols should mirror the procedures intended in the full trial [2], enabling researchers to identify and rectify shortcomings, determine appropriate outcome measures, and calculate an appropriate sample size.",

In short, WATCH IT is a programme for obese children and adolescents, delivered in the community setting by non-professional health trainers. Obesity is most prevalent in the socially disadvantaged, who are notoriously most difficult to reach and treat. Thus, WATCH IT was purposely located within socially disadvantaged areas of Leeds. Use of health trainers, rather than medical professionals, is part of an National Health Service (NHS) initiative to include a cost-effective addition to services aimed at tackling inequalities in health and targeting resources on individuals and areas in greatest need. WATCH IT health trainers are appointed for their personal qualities and communication skills. They do not have to have any formal health qualifications, but they receive 2 weeks of training in the intervention delivery and have ongoing support and supervision from a team leader (an educationalist), a children's nurse, dietician, psychologist, and a paediatrician. The WATCH IT programme takes a motivation-enhancing, solution-focussed approach and is embedded within Primary Care Trust Services in Leeds. The core programme length is 4 months, after which families can opt to continue for a further 4 or 8 months. Child and parent/carer receive weekly individual appointments structured on the Healthy Eating Lifestyle Programme [6] and group physical activity sessions. Individual weekly appointments are provided for young people and their parents, allowing any emotional or social issues that may be affecting the young person's ability to achieve healthy behaviours also to be addressed.",

We sought to recruit 70 children over a 6-month period beginning September 2006. This target was chosen pragmatically based on participation in the programme in previous years. Obese children and adolescents considered for enrolment were Feasibility RCT for WATCH IT 757 http://ctj.sagepub.com Clinical Trials 2011; 8: 755 -764 aged 8-16 years and had a body mass index (BMI) > 98th percentile value and a parent or carer with fluent spoken English. Children with a medical cause for obesity, severe learning difficulties, significant medical or psychiatric problems, or siblings already enrolled as participants were excluded. Candidate participants were recruited through health professionals or self-referral; publicity was amplified during the recruitment period through media coverage. In addition, the WATCH IT database was searched for children who had been referred previously or enquired about the programme but had not taken part. During the study period, only families agreeing to be part of the research were able to enrol in the WATCH IT treatment programme. After informed consent (parental consent and child assent) and baseline assessment, participants were randomised to either WATCH IT or a waiting list control for 12 months using a remote automated telephone randomisation system. Randomisation was stratified by BMI standard deviation score (SDS; \u22643.0 vs. >3.0), age (\u226412 years vs. >12 years), gender, and maternal level of education (less than General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) or equivalent (attainment reached at the age of 16 years) vs. higher).

Open response questions were used to get a general overview of acceptability (e.g., what has been your overall experience of the WATCH IT assessments? Please try to think about both positive and negative things); prompts were provided (e.g., what about the way that it was set up, so that you had a 50/50 chance of starting WATCH IT straight away, or going onto a waiting list?). Focussed questions concerning the assessments also were asked (e.g., do you have any comments about some of the types of tests and assessments that you or your child were asked to do during each visit?) with prompts (what about the blood tests that your child had? How about the questionnaires; you or your child?). Parents and children were interviewed separately; thus, a total of 14 interviews were conducted.

Data (mean, CIs) are presented below for interest even though the study was not powered to detect an effect of the intervention. Questionnaire feasibility was determined via participant acceptability, mean duration for completion (minutes), and standardised response means (SRM), a measure of the sensitivity of each questionnaire to detect change. SRM was calculated as mean change in scores or values divided by the standard deviation in change scores [15]. The SRM provides the relative magnitude of mean change compared with the variability of change, with higher SRM values indicating greater sensitivity. BMI and waist circumference measurements were converted to SDSs using UK 1990 growth references [16]. For selection of a primary outcome for the multi-centre trial (based on the ability of BMI, waist circumference, and BIA to predict DXA), multiple linear regression modelling was used, starting with a full model and using backwards selection, to identify which variables were predictors of DXA fat mass after adjusting for age and gender. Model assumptions were checked (normally distributed residuals and constant variance) and, when necessary, variables were log transformed to improve model fit. The models that best predicted baseline DXA (those with the most significant predictors and the highest R 2 value) were then applied separately to the 6-and 12-month DXA results in order to see how well the models predicted fat mass. Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).",

Thirty participants (31%) were professionally referred and 66 (69%) were self-referred. More self-referred families consented to participate in the research than professionally referred families (55% and 29%, respectively).

However, data collection staff reported that children often complained or exhibited apathy during completion of the Harter scale and the WATCH IT diet questionnaire, which took longer to complete than the other questionnaires ( Table 2). The Harter scale took twice as long to complete as the other psychological measures, including the SDQ and the PedsQoL. The WATCH IT diet questionnaire had many questions asking about foods and drinks throughout the day, with five simple summary questions aimed at estimating consumption of some key items over the whole day. On examination, there was a moderate correlation between the summary questions and the sum of the detailed individual items (R 2 range 0.5-0.7; p < 0.001), indicating that it would be possible and desirable to change the format to focus on the summary questions. SRMs were calculated to estimate the sensitivity of each questionnaire to detect change. While insufficient data were available to determine a clinically sufficient SRM for each of the tools, we were able to make comparisons between questionnaires. Comparisons were especially important for psychological questionnaires in which more than one outcome was measured. SRM values for change between baseline and 12 months for the psychological well-being scales are shown in Table 2, with the PedsQoL demonstrating the greatest sensitivity. Thus, overall, the PedsQoL was considered the most feasible psychological well-being questionnaire, with a relatively low time for completion and the greatest sensitivity. Valid accelerometer data in which there was at least 500 min of recording for at least 3 days [17] were recorded for 51, 27, and 28 children at baseline, 6, and 12 months, respectively, translating to 73% (51/70), 48% (27/56), and 53% (28/53) of complete accelerometry data for those participants who remained in the trial.",

In the absence of clinical information regarding what constitutes a clinically important difference in change in percent body fat, we assumed that a difference of 0.75 is important, which translates to a standardised effect size of 0.326, usually considered moderate. Thus, 199 participants per group would be required to provide 90% power at the 5% significance level. However, as the sample size calculations should account for the natural clustering of outcomes by trainer (we estimated sample cluster size to be at most 16 children in the full-scale trial), the sample size was inflated by a design effect of 1.75 (assuming an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05) to yield a revised total sample size of 69 participants. Allowing for 25% loss to follow-up (as observed in the feasibility study), we estimated that the multi-centre trial would require 930 participants to provide a definitive indication of clinical effectiveness and to allow a moderate effect size to be detected in other outcomes.",

In order to maximise participation in the feasibility study, entry into WATCH IT was only via the trial during the study period and usual enrolment was halted immediately prior to its start. As a result of randomisation of families to the waiting list, the programme ran at reduced capacity. Health trainers reported a disruption to group sessions (especially physical activity sessions), in which they believed that the children were less motivated. The health trainers also complained that the requirement to adhere to protocol constrained them and prevented them from working in a more flexible manner to suit the individual needs of children. Another major influence of the research was that at the end of the trial, capacity had to double to allow the waiting list control participants immediate access to the programme as they had been guaranteed during recruitment.",

We were able to recruit the desired number of participants within a desirable time frame and showed acceptable loss to follow-up for the research that was comparable with other similar research protocols [1]. Furthermore, our recruitment strategy resulted in adequate numbers of children from socially disadvantaged families, a group that are more likely to be obese, yet can be difficult to access and recruit into research. However, the majority of families were of White British nationality; we therefore learnt that recruitment of a more heterogeneous ethnic sample warrants consideration in future research. The research methodology was acceptable to participants, and the recruitment strategies were successful. However, returning to an old database to recruit families who had been referred previously to an ongoing programme but had failed to participate in it was not productive. Implementation of the feasibility trial has enabled us to develop a robust protocol for a definitive multi-centre trial. However, since the feasibility trial was only conducted at one centre, we recognise that there may be other feasibility issues with multiple centres that were not measurable or observed at a single centre. Key findings did not necessarily form part of the formal hypotheses of the trial. However, the feasibility trial enables us to address issues that were not been considered prior to the conduct of large multi-centre trials. Potential shortcomings, related to pragmatic issues associated with data collection, were identified. For example, initiation of an intervention was dependent upon the needs and availability of both the family and the programme, and the actual intervention start date could not always immediately follow baseline assessment. Thus, baseline measurements may have changed prior to the actual start of the intervention. Designers of future protocols should consider adopting a flexible start date for the intervention. Similarly, followup assessments may not be made exactly as specified in the research timeline because of holidays or sickness. Other key lessons for the design of an evaluation of a complex intervention in obese children are that blinding of assessors is important to reduce bias; automated electronic randomisation improves efficiency and separates responsibility from the researcher; children should be interviewed without their parents; and careful consideration should be placed on the ordering of assessments. We discovered that assessment blinding was most likely to become compromised during a test that also was administered as part of the intervention programme. Thus, future study designs should ensure tests which can reveal group allocation (i.e., those most likely to stimulate conversation related to the intervention) should be administered late in the assessment. Our initial protocol did not consider interviewing children separately from their parents. It soon became apparent, however, that separation would be necessary in order to get responses to questionnaires directly from the child, rather than via the parent. In the first two interviews, it was obvious that parents found it difficult to avoid answering the questions for their children.",

We used DXA to measure fat mass as a primary outcome, which incurred a cost of \u00a314,700. We estimated that its use in the definitive trial (based on the suggested sample size of 930) would cost \u00a3195,300. Financial constraints and availability of a DXA apparatus therefore may preclude it use. Since DXA data were well correlated with BMI, BIA, and waist circumference, which primary outcome to use may be a pragmatic choice. Secondary outcomes in childhood obesity research are notoriously difficult to measure. Self-report methods often are biased systematically and objective measures are usually expensive and often infeasible. There is a lack of consistency in the use of outcome measures, in part, due to a lack of valid tools. Importantly, through this work, we have confirmed that more research is required to have confidence in the secondary outcome measures. While we found the measures to be feasible, we believe that more research is necessary to ascertain the validity and reliability of outcomes within a paediatric obese population. The UK National Obesity Observatory has published a standard evaluation framework to guide proficient research for assessing childhood obesity interventions, but it is evident that one of the greatest barriers at present is the lack of valid and reliable outcome measures [18]. Accelerometry is accepted as a useful and objective method to measure habitual physical activity [19][20][21]. However, in a community-based paediatric sample, we had many monitors that were returned without valid data. Using relatively relaxed criteria for data quality of at least 500 min of recording for at least 3 days [17], we received only 53% of accelerometers with valid data at 12 months. Given the high degree of resources required from researchers and participants to collect accelerometry data, future researchers with this type of population should consider carefully whether their collection is cost-effective. Lower criteria might have to be accepted; for example, rather than choosing a predefined inclusion criterion (e.g., minimum of 10 h a day), Alhassan et al. [22] calculated the number of minutes required to obtain a correlation coefficient of 0.80 for the average count per minute of randomly selected blocks of 30 min correlated with average counts for the full day.",

Rather, owing to the complexities of behavioural change interventions, they may be viewed as a continuum. For example, we are confident that our study design meets scientific rigour in terms of optimising independence of the treatment effect via implementation of carefully allocated active and control conditions, appropriately stratified randomisation, use of standardised treatment and evaluation protocols, generation of a homogeneous comparison group, and optimal blinding.",

However, the nature of the intervention and its delivery within the NHS results in uncertainty of the level of adherence to the interventions regardless of provider fidelity to the intervention. Because it is not possible to consider all potential confounding factors within a community-based intervention for which participants are expected to make lifestyle changes, efficacy cannot be guaranteed. Ultimately, the WATCH IT programme aims to provide services across the UK. Thus, it is imperative that it demonstrate effectiveness (rather than efficacy) under 'real-world' conditions or in 'natural' settings [24]. Furthermore, it has been argued that trials demonstrating efficacy are not essential before effectiveness trials are conducted, provided that the effectiveness trial meets all of the standards of efficacy trials.",

With initiation of the feasibility study, the programme initially was constrained to operate at lower than usual capacity due to randomisation. It then had to increase capacity at the end of the trial to allow entry of the waiting list control group participants. Recognition of these issues has informed the design of future trials, which must address the impact of randomisation on programmes during the trials and at their conclusion. Surprisingly, we also discovered through the health trainers that families who had started WATCH IT before the trial and were not involved in the research (but who were integrated with the trial participants) were disappointed that their clinical assessment lacked the depth that was given in the trial assessments. Such information has enabled us to consider the importance of working with the service providers and service users in the design of future trials; it is possible that future trials will be conducted only in areas where there is no established service. A constant dialogue was maintained with the service providers throughout the study period to help the researchers to understand the impact of the study on the intervention. In addition, we elicited formal feedback from at least one service provider during regular steering committee meetings. While this feedback ensured that we met the feasibility study objectives, we recommend continued service provider involvement in the design of future RCTs in order to gain greater understanding of the processes involved in generating a behavioural change.",

However, we recommend that all researchers evaluating the effect of obesity interventions conduct an exploratory feasibility or pilot study prior to designing definitive trials of effectiveness. Feasibility testing of obesity interventions is common in the literature, but there remains a lack of studies that test the feasibility of conducting the research. Those that do provide valuable assistance to future researchers [25] but cannot substitute the conduct of feasibility trials related to the evaluation of specific interventions. Our results have highlighted the appropriateness of following a cyclical sequence of research pathways, as suggested by the MRC [2], so that additional formative research can be considered prior to large-scale testing if necessary. In doing so, researchers and clinical staff can avoid wasting time and/or resources on running definitive trials before they are 100% confident in both the research and the intervention.",
