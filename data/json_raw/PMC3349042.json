            "text": "Schizandra chinensis Baillon is a traditional folk medicine plant that is used to treat and prevent several inflammatory diseases and cancer in Korea, but the underlying mechanisms involved in its anti-allergic activity are not fully understood. This study was designed to investigate mechanisms of anti-allergic activity of a Schizandra chinensis Baillon water extract (SCWE) in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-antigen complex-stimulated RBL2H3 cells and to assess whether gastric and intestinal digestion affects the anti-allergic properties of SCWE. Oxidative stress is an important consequence of the allergic inflammatory response. The antioxidant activities of SCWE increased in a concentration-dependent manner. RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with monoclonal anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) specific IgE, treated with SCWE, and challenged with the antigen DNP-human serum albumin. SCWE inhibited \u03b2-hexosaminidase release and expression of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) mRNA and protein in IgE-antigen complex-stimulated RBL2H3 cells. We found that digested SCWE fully maintained its antioxidant activity and anti-allergic activity against the IgE-antigen complex-induced activation of RBL-2H3 cells. SCWE may be useful for preventing allergic diseases, such as asthma. Thus, SCWE could be used as a natural functional ingredient for allergic diseases in the food and/or pharmaceutical industries.",

            "text": "In an anaphylactic type of allergy, binding of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and antigen to the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u03b5RI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils induces the release of preformed intragranular mediators [1]. Mast cells and basophils play important roles initiating and perpetuating the inflammatory responses that mediate allergic reactions by secreting abundant levels of proinflammatory mediators such as histamine and several cytokines, including interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [2]. Mast cell and basophil activation is initiated when antigens with surface-bound IgE bind to Fc\u03b5RI on the mast cell surface and induce degranulation and release of cytokines [3]. The rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3, which expresses Fc\u03b5RI, is widely used to study the molecular basis of mast cell activation [3]. This cell line has also been used to develop anti-allergy drugs that reduce allergic symptoms, including steroids that have anti-histamine actions and anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit cytokine production [2,3]. However, the effectiveness of such drugs is limited by their side effects. These problems have led to increasing interest in traditional herbal medicines that have been used to treat allergic diseases. As a result, more and more studies examining the efficacy of natural extracts and compounds isolated from natural extracts to prevent and treat allergic disorders are being performed.",

            "text": "S. chinensis Baillon is used as a medicinal plant in Asia [4]. In this study, we generated SCWE to examine its ability to suppress the IgE-antigen complex-induced allergic activation of RBL-2H3 cells. SCWE contains polyphenol compounds and it may provide protection against an allergic response. When phenolic compounds are consumed in the diet, the stomach enhances the release of phenolic compounds in natural extracts [15]. Phenolic compounds are absorbed from the stomach in a free form [16,17] and are extensively metabolized in the stomach and intestines [15]. Flavonoids, the main category of polyphenols, are absorbed from the small intestine. Subsequently, flavonoids are methylated, sulfated or glucuronidated as conjugates [18]. Anthocyanins are very sensitive to pH and are relatively unstable; thus, the color changed under different pH conditions (red in the acidic condition and purple in the neural condition). Glycosidic anthocyanins are abundant at low pH but anthocyanidins (aglycone) are exhibited in mildly acidic conditions [18]. Thus, some biological activities of phenolic compounds may be altered by changes in the stomach due to the acidic and neutral environments of the stomach and intestines, respectively. It is thus necessary to analyze the biological properties of their digestion products. It is unknown whether digested DSCWE retains its biological activity. We subjected SCWE to digestion using a simulated human digestive system to determine whether digestion affects the functional properties of SCWE. Simulated saliva and gastric juices as a model system has been used in previous studies [7,8], so we chose the same model system to test the effect of artificial digestive juice on antioxidant and anti-allergic activities of SCWE. We found that DSCWE fully maintained antioxidant and anti-allergic activities compared with those of SCWE as assessed by total phenolics levels, DPPH radical scavenging activity, \u03b2-hexosaminidase release, and measurements of allergy-related cytokine (IL-4, IL-13, and TNF\u03b1) production. Our results suggest that the antioxidant and anti-allergic compounds in SCWE were not inactivated by gastric acid and intestinal juices.",

            "text": "Oxidative stress is an important consequence of the inflammatory response in allergic diseases, and oxidative stress is associated with a decrease in antioxidant activity in the respiratory tract [6]. Thus, we first examined the antioxidant activities of SCWE and DSCWE and the effect of both preparations on the secretion of \u03b2-hexosaminidase in IgE-antigen complex-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. These two cellular properties may be mechanistically related, because allergic inflammation is believed to be driven by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated by macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells in response to various factors. These ROS may then promote degranulation of mast cells, which can be determined by measuring the release of \u03b2-hexosaminidase, which is the granule marker of mast cells [3]. These observations suggest that compounds with antioxidant properties may be able to inhibit the mast cell degranulation that occurs during an allergic reaction. Many plants contain pharmacological compounds with antioxidant properties [19]. That such antioxidant plant compounds could have anti-allergy capability is supported by two recent studies showing that polyphenolic compounds from tea and coffee inhibit degranulation and histamine release from mast cells [12,20]. In our study, measurements of the total polyphenol levels and antioxidant activity of SCWE and DSCWE revealed that both increased in a concentration-dependent manner. This is consistent with a study showing that the total phenol content of fruit and plant extracts correlates well with their antioxidant capacities [21]. Notably, SCWE and DSCWE also markedly inhibited the increase in \u03b2-hexosaminidase release in IgE-antigen complexstimulated RBL-2H3 cells. Thus, the antioxidant activity of the polyphenolic compounds in SCWE may be responsible for the ability of SCWE to inhibit \u03b2-hexosaminidase release.",

            "text": "We also examined the effects of SCWE and DSCWE on cytokine production of in IgE-antigen complex-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. It is known that various cytokines, including the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and the Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, play critical roles in allergic inflammation [2,22]. IL-4 is essential for IgE production [23] and promotes the switch from naive T cells to allergic type Th2 cells [24]. IL-13 affects many processes that contribute to an asthmatic phenotype, including inflammation, fibrosis, and mucus production. As a result, a number of experimental approaches have sought to neutralize the production of IL-13 as a novel therapeutic strategy for allergic asthma [25,26]. TNF-\u03b1 is a potent inflammatory mediator that is mainly produced by activated various cell types in response to allergic pulmonary inflammation, including mast cells, macrophages, basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, and epithelial cells. TNF-\u03b1 is also synthesized and secreted by mast cells and basophils as a result of IgE and antigen challenge [27]. We found that SCWE and DSCWE inhibited upregulation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, and IL-13 mRNA and protein in IgE-antigen complex-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. These results are consistent with the finding that anti-allergenic compounds such as thunberginol B and luteolin inhibit upregulation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13 mRNA after RBL-2H3 cells are stimulated with DNP-BSA [2]. We found that TNF-\u03b1 protein levels did not decrease in a dose-dependent manner after SCWE or DSCWE treatment compared to that in untreated control cells, suggesting that TNF-\u03b1, a potent proinflammatory cytokine with immunoregulatory activities, responded strongly at low concentrations of SCWE or DSCWE. Quan et al. [28] reported that allergy-related cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 do not change in a dosedependent manner following treatment with anti-allergic extract (Saururus chinensis ethanol extract) and that IL-4 and IL-13 levels decreased significantly at a doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg S. chinensis ethanol extract with similar levels. It is possible that some types of anti-allergic extracts and anti-allergy drugs may dose-dependently decrease allergy-related cytokines levels, whereas others may not.",
