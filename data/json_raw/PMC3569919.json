            "text": "There are a number of gas ionization sensors using carbon nanotubes as cathode or anode. Unfortunately, their applications are greatly limited by their multi-valued sensitivity, one output value corresponding to several measured concentration values. Here we describe a triple-electrode structure featuring two electric fields with opposite directions, which enable us to overcome the multi-valued sensitivity problem at 1 atm in a wide range of gas concentrations. We used a carbon nanotube array as the first electrode, and the two electric fields between the upper and the lower interelectrode gaps were designed to extract positive ions generated in the upper gap, hence significantly reduced positive ion bombardment on the nanotube electrode, which allowed us to maintain a high electric field near the nanotube tips, leading to a single-valued sensitivity and a long nanotube life. We have demonstrated detection of various gases and simultaneously monitoring temperature, and a potential for applications. I n 2001, carbon nanotube film was used to fabricate a double-electrode discharge gas sensor in our lab 1 , which triggered an explosion of research on carbon nanotube based gas sensors [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] . Unfortunately, these gas sensors exhibited multi-valued sensitivity of breakdown voltage or discharge current in response to targeted gas component at 1 atm total operating pressure, therefore their applications are limited because a single-valued sensitivity [14][15][16][17][18][19][20] to detection target is required for gas sensors. Additionally, the sensors in this configuration of double-electrode operated in self-sustaining discharge states, in which positive ions heavily bombard the cathode comprised of either nanotubes or a metal plate. In case of either a carbon nanotube cathode or a nanotube anode is used, current density can rise to a considerably large value around 100 A/m 2 , resulting in nanotube film damage 21 and a short operating life [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] .",

Here we report a triple-electrode structure with single-valued sensitivity and longer electrode life. The structure used a carbon nanotube array as the first electrode, featuring two electric fields with directions opposite each other, and is highly sensitive to various gases and capable of the detection directly from gas mixtures without separation in a wide range of the concentrations from 0 to 100%, as well as capable of monitoring temperature in a range of 17-120uC at the same time. In comparison to other existing sensors [22][23][24][25][26][27][28] , our design integrated gas and temperature detection into several tripolar electrode structures, featuring distinct interelectrode separations, capable of the operation at low power. Potentially, this could lead to a miniaturized gas ionization sensor with capability of multi-functional detections.",

            "text": "A triple-electrode structure is designed for gas detection at 1 atm, which is comprised of a carbon nanotube array cathode, an extracting electrode and a collecting electrode ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1). The multiwalled nanotube (MWNT) film ( Fig. 1b) was grown by thermal chemical vapor deposition 29,30 (TCVD) on one side of the Si cathode covered by a Ti/Ni/Au film. Nanotubes in the film are ,50 nm in diameter, and ,5-6 mm in length. The distance between nanotubes is ,50-100 nm. Ti/Ni/Au film was also sputtered on both sides of the extracting electrode (Fig. 1a, c) and the inner side of the collecting electrode for increasing initial discharge current. The sensor array was placed in a detection chamber with an electrical input and output interface, and air was pumped out of the chamber to establish a low vacuum with a gas pressure of 5 kPa. The gas to be detected was then introduced in a controlled fashion into the chamber until pressure is increased to 1 atm. The sensor displays very fast response within around the order of 10 26 s 31 in comparison to other sensors 2,31,32 due to its non-self-sustaining discharge state. During operation, suitable d.c. voltages of U e and U c are applied between the cathode and the extracting electrode, and between the cathode and the collecting electrode ( Fig. 1c), respectively. U e is higher than U c , which generates two electric fields E 1 and E 2 in reversed field direction. The field near the nanotube tips is much higher than that in the other region. Consequently, ionization takes place near the tips in around 1 mm range (reference). Through collision and diffusion, significant amount of positive ions overcome the weak field near the extracting electrode and move into the region between the extracting and the collecting electrodes, then they are accelerated by E 2 towards the collecting electrode ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. S2A). Therefore bombardment of the positive ions on nanotubes is considerably reduced, which hindered occurrence of self-sustaining discharge, resulting in a significantly longer life-span of nanotube electrode, and consequently a single-valued sensitivity.",

Non-self-sustaining discharge current I is mainly determined by gas partial pressure, electrode separation and gas temperature; and the gas partial pressure is proportional to gas concentration. Therefore, at a given electrode separation, I is direct measurements of gas concentration and temperature. We found that distances between electrodes had a distinct effect on the detection. By varying the distances between electrodes, we were able to identify different gas species in a gas mixture without component separation and measure temperature at the same time. Single-valued sensitivity to several gases and mixtures were obtained under electric field above a critical value by control of electrode separation and applied voltages on electrodes. Single-valued sensitivity to gas temperature was also observed. We also found that temperature has a great effect on gas detection sensitivity, the higher gas temperature, the higher sensitivity.",

When the concentration of gas probed is increased in a gas mixture with N 2 , it reduces N 2 concentration at the same time, therefore single-valued decrease of collecting current with increasing concentration of the gas probed can be observed at given electric field up to a critical value. Gas ionization properties of the triple-electrode structure were tested for new insights of the mechanism of the detection. First, we measured the current I e flowing through the nanotube cathode in C 2 H 2 at 80 V U e with 200 mm electrode separations (between cathode and extracting electrode and between extracting electrode and collecting electrode, in general we kept two separations the same). We found that I e 5 ,2I c ( Supplementary Fig. S4). Current density j e passing the nanotubes can be calculated by dividing I e with the crosssectional area of all nanotubes. To understand the effect of gas concentration and electric field on gas conductivity, we tested NO in a concentration range of 0-690 ppm at various extracting voltages of U e and 120 mm electrode separations. Gas conductivity of NO, calculated by dividing j e with the average electric field between the cathode and the extracting electrode 38 , was observed that it remained constant with rising average electric field and monotonically decreased with increasing NO concentration ( Supplementary Fig.  S5A). The results indicate a single-valued sensitivity mechanism of our structure for NO detection. Furthermore we evaluate the effect of gas temperature and electric field on gas ionization. Current density j e was found exponentially dependent on gas temperature and linearly dependent on average electric field in pure N 2 at 200 mm separations ( Supplementary Fig. S6A, C), which follows the field-assisted thermal emission law 38 . It showed a potential of the structure for detecting gas temperature. To study the effect of gas concentration on electron emission ability of carbon nanotubes which greatly contributed to gas discharge current, we conducted tests using two sensors with 100 mm and 120 mm electrode separations at 80 V U e with NO concentrations from 0 to 700 ppm and at gas temperatures from 30 to 80uC ( Supplementary Fig. S7A, B). Schottky barrier w was calculated according to Eq. 3. We observed that slightly barrier increasing with NO concentration ( Supplementary Fig. S7C, D) could induce large change of collecting current. The result showed the effect of gas concentration on emission ability of nanotubes and also sensing potential of our structure.  Fig. S5B), current density was also higher and up to 10 2 A/m 2 order ( Supplementary Fig. S6D). This arises from the secondary electron emission induced by heavy bombardment of the positive ions on the nanotube cathode. Higher current density resulted in shorter lifespan of nanotubes and multi-valued sensitivity of double-electrode structure [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] .",

When detection chamber volume is given, partial pressure is proportional to component concentration. Therefore the collecting current I c in Fig. 3c and d is determined mainly by three factors of electrode separation, NO concentration Q NO and SO 2 concentration Q SO2 , which can be described as follows: on I 1 , respectively; g 0 , g 1 and g 2 in Eq. (5) describe the effect of d 2 , Q NO and Q SO2 on I 2 , respectively. a 0 , a 1 , and a 2 are the coefficients of f 0 , f 1 and f 2 , respectively; b 0 , b 1 and b 2 are the coefficients of g 0 , g 1 and g 2 , respectively. From the equations (4) and (5), values of Q NO and Q SO2 can be solved. Therefore, by careful study of gas component interaction mechanism with electrodes and design of the sensor configuration, sensors capable for multi-component detection may be designed, and concentrations of the two components could be obtained through detection followed by data processing according to the equations (4) and (5). Fig. 4 shows that this technique is also valid for direct detection of H 2 , C 2 H 2 , and C 2 H 4 in a mixture by using three sensors with different electrode separations (Fig. 4). To C 2 H 2 , detection was sensitive down to 1 ppm. The results suggested that the sensor array with different electrode separations has potential for use in trace gas and gas component detections. Two sensors with different electrode separations were fabricated to simultaneously detect 0-700 ppm NO and gas temperature at 80 V of U e , respectively (Fig. 5a, b and Supplementary Fig. S7A,  B). Tests were conducted while NO concentration increased from 0 to 700 ppm at various given temperature values in a range of 30-80uC. The sensor with 100 mm electrode separation detected NO in a range of 0-700 ppm, and exhibits the highest sensitivity of 223 pA/ ppm to 335 ppm NO (Supplementary Table S1). The other sensor with 120 mm separation detected gas temperature in a range of 30-80uC, and exhibits the highest sensitivity of 1 nA/uC to 70uC ( Supplementary Table S2). Fig. 5a and b also show the effect of gas temperature on NO detection and that of NO concentration on temperature detection, respectively. The highest cross sensitivity of the NO sensor to temperature is 2.0 3 10 22 /uC ( Supplementary  Table S1), two orders higher than that of the temperature sensor to NO, 23.1 3 10 24 ppm 21 ( Supplementary Table S2), indicating a stronger effect of temperature on NO detection than that of NO on temperature detection.",

(1) and (2)), we can obtain an equation for I c in dependent of d, Q and T at given voltages applied on three electrodes. In this case, the collecting current I c is determined by the three factors of electrode separation d, NO concentration Q NO and gas temperature T, which can be described as follows:  7are the coefficients of g 0 , g 1 and g 2 , respectively. These coefficients can be determined experimentally (Fig. 5a, b and Supplementary Fig. S7A, B). The values of Q NO and T can be obtained by solving Eqs. (6) and (7). Similarly, a proper data processing of the data shown on Fig. 5a and b could be conducted, resulting in detection of NO concentration and gas temperature at the same time. Moreover, three sensors with various distinct electrode separations were fabricated and used to simultaneously detect a SO 2 -NO mixture and gas temperature (Fig. 6). The sensor with a 100 mm electrode separation showed a highest sensitivity of 27.7 nA/ppm to 298 ppm NO ( Supplementary Table S3), the sensor with a 75 mm electrode separation showed a highest sensitivity of 23.8 nA/ppm to 280 ppm SO 2 (Supplementary Table S4), and the sensor with a 120 mm electrode separation showed a highest sensitivity of 83.2 nA/uC to 120uC (Supplementary Table S5). The highest cross sensitivity to temperature is one order higher than that to NO and SO 2 ( Supplementary Tables S3-5), respectively, indicating a greater effect of temperature on NO and SO 2 detection than that of NO or SO 2 concentration on temperature detection. A proper data processing of the data presented in Fig. 6 could also be conducted and could simultaneously detect the two components and gas temperature. Sensitivity of the sensor to gas temperature in pure N 2 was also tested (Fig. 6d), and displayed a highest sensitivity value of 14.9 mA/uC to 100uC ( Supplementary  Table S6), considerably higher than that to gas concentration by ,three orders and higher than that of existing temperature measurement technology by ,one order 26 . The results further suggested that our sensor with distinct gaps can work as gas sensor and temperature sensor at the same time, leading to the development of integrated sensing devices with capability for temperature monitoring and concentration detection at the same time. Additionally, our sensor is superior to the existing temperature measurement technology [26][27][28] . Our study overcame a key barrier of double-electrode and tripolar electrode ionic gas sensors, that is multi-valued sensitivity [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] to gas concentration at 1 atm operating pressure. Through design of the triple-electrode gas sensor and careful control of the distances from the extracting electrode to the cathode and the collecting electrode as   well as the field direction and the voltages between them, we were able to significantly reduce ion bombardment on the carbon nanotube cathode, hence increase field strength at lower voltage near the tips without quick tip damaging, which leads to a single-valued sensitivity in a wide range. We have demonstrated multi-gas detection as well as simultaneously gas and temperature detection capability, and that our design is superior to existing commercial gas and temperature sensors [22][23][24][25][26][27][28] . With further development, we believe this work could lead to miniaturized, multi-functional sensing devices.",

They were processed through photolithography and dry etching, resulting in the cathode with two round holes, the extracting electrode with one round hole, and the collecting electrode with a 200 mm deep square blind hole. 50 nm thick Ti film, 400 nm thick Ni film and 125 nm thick Au film were deposited in sequence by magnetron sputtering on both sides of extracting electrode (Fig. 1a, c) and the inner side of cathode and collecting electrode. Then the three electrodes were rapidly annealed ( Supplementary  Fig. S1A-C) in a low vacuum of ,3.0 Pa at 450uC for 50 seconds to alloy the Ti/Ni/ Au film. On the annealed Ti/Ni/Au film of cathode, vertically aligned multiwalled nanotube (MWNT) array ( Supplementary Fig. S1D) was grown by thermal chemical vapor deposition (TCVD) method. Polyester film was cut as the insulating strips between electrodes with 2-mm width and various given thickness which corresponds to various electrode separation of the device. In the final step golden wires were bonded on the edge of electrodes and the three electrodes were bonded together with insulating glue, and finally, the sensor device ( Supplementary Fig. S1E) was fabricated.",

An automatic gas mixing system was consisted of an operation platform based on a computer, a gas mixing chamber, and a gas and temperature detection chamber. There were five gas cylinders containing high purity gas with concentration accuracy of 2%. One of them supplied the environment gas N 2 and the others supplied the measured gas. Five mass flow controllers (MFC, Line Tech M3030V with 1% accuracy) were used to continuously regulate gas flux for preparing mixed gas concentrations. The full scales of the five MFCs were two with 50 mL/min, one with 100 mL/min, one with 500 mL/ min and one with 1000 mL/min. 2.5% accuracy of the gas concentration in two/three/ four component mixtures was obtained through calculation on the basis of 1% accuracy of MFC and 2% accuracy of source gas. After well mixed in a gas mixing chamber, gas mixture flowed into a sealable stainless steel detection chamber with a pressure meter to detect gas pressure. A temperature control device was used to control gas temperature and the temperature can be increased to the set value within 1 minute.

The three power modules provided voltages needed for the electrodes (Fig. 1c). Two of the power modules were connected in series to provide 0-150 V voltage for extracting electrodes of the sensors, and the other power module provided 0-100 V voltage for collecting electrodes. The digital multimeter modules with shielded cables are capable of acquiring the collecting currents from pA to nA for five sensors at the same time. All acquired data were recorded to a computer through a LabVIEW program linked to MXI interface.",
