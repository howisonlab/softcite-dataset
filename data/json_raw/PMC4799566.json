            "text": "Background: It is often challenging to distinguish tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) from malignant pleural effusion (MPE); thoracoscopy is among the techniques with the highest diagnostic ability in this regard. However, such invasive examinations cannot be performed on the elderly, or on those in poor physical condition. The aim of this study was to explore the differential diagnostic value of carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) associated antigen in patients with TPE and MPE. Methods: Using electrochemiluminescence, we measured the concentration of tumor markers (TMs) in the pleural effusion and serum of patients with TPE (n = 35) and MPE (n = 95). We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the TMs and differentiate between TPE and MPE. Results: The cutoff values for each TM in serum were: CA125, 151.55 U/ml; CA199, 9.88 U/ml; CEA, 3.50 ng/ml; NSE, 13.27 ng/ml; and SCC, 0.85 ng/ml. Those in pleural fluid were: CA125, 644.30 U/ml; CA199, 12.08 U/ml; CEA, 3.35 ng/ml; NSE, 9.71 ng/ml; and SCC, 1.35 ng/ml. The cutoff values for the ratio of pleural fluid concentration to serum concentration (P/S ratio) of each TM were: CA125, 5.93; CA199, 0.80; CEA, 1.47; NSE, 0.76; and SCC, 0.90. The P/S ratio showed the highest specificity in the case of CEA (97.14%). ROC curve analysis revealed that, for all TMs, the area under the curve in pleural fluid (0.95) was significantly different from that in serum (0.85; P < 0.001). Conclusions: TMs in TPE differ significantly from those in MPE, especially when detected in pleural fluid. The combined detection of TMs can improve diagnostic sensitivity.",

The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of age or sex. Table 2 shows the main clinical and radiological characteristics of the patients. A greater percentage of patients in the TPE group than in the MPE group experienced fever (45.71%; P < 0.001). The two groups also showed significant differences in terms of imaging parameters; namely, single nodules, pleural nodules, localized pleural thickening, and mediastinal hilum lymph node enlargement, which is defined as a node diameter >1 cm (P < 0.05 in all cases).

To this end, we established the following diagnostic models: Model 1 involved the serum level of all TMs; Model 2 the pleural fluid level; Model 3 the P/S ratio:    Table 4 shows the predicted outcome: The accuracy of Model 2 (88.15%) was higher than that of the other models (P < 0.001). The ROC curves are shown in Figure 1. dIscussIon PE can be caused by more than 50 diseases, including primary lung disease, systemic disease, organ dysfunction, drug-induced PE, and tumor metastasis. It is important in clinical practice to analyze both the cause and clinical features in patients with PE; for this purpose, cytological examination is routinely performed. However, the positive diagnostic rate of this technique is about 50% in patients with MPE. [8] Even though adenocarcinoma is the most common cause of MPE, a significant number of hematological and nonhematological causes also exist. To ensure an accurate diagnosis, cytopathologists, and clinicians must keep these uncommon phenomena in mind during routine practice. [9] The currently available data indicate that, in cases where aspiration cytology reveals negativity for exudative PE, thoracoscopy under local anesthetic is among the techniques with the highest diagnostic ability; the method has about 88-96% diagnostic sensitivity for malignant pleural disease. [10][11][12] However, such invasive examinations cannot be performed in the elderly, or in those in poor physical condition. Uncontrollable coughing from pleural irritation also contraindicates thoracoscopy, as it is hazardous to access and visualize the whole pleura in such cases. [13] Currently, the cause of PE is unclear in nearly 20% of patients, [14] and many researchers have shown that TMs may help differentiate TPE from MPE. Furthermore, a combination of several TMs may improve the diagnostic power for MPE. [5,8,[15][16][17][18] The choice of TMs in this study was based on those used in clinical practice to detect ovarian cancer (CA125), gastrointestinal and lung cancer (CA199), digestive and lung cancer (CEA), nonsmall cell lung cancer (SCC), and small cell lung cancer (NSE). The serum and pleural fluid concentrations of CA125, CA199, CEA, and NSE were significantly higher in MPE than in TPE (P < 0.05); similar results have been reported in other studies. [2,19,20] We reviewed studies addressing the level of TMs in serum and pleural fluid, but only a few described P/S ratio. [21,22] In this study, we found that the P/S ratios of CEA and CA125 were lower in TPE than in MPE. Korczynski et al. [23] reported a similar result regarding CEA, although the P/S ratio of CA125 was not significantly different. Li et al. [24] found that higher CA125 levels are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease in elderly Chinese individuals, and that CEA exhibited 70% sensitivity and 100% specificity for adenocarcinoma cells in PE. [3] We believe that these differences may be due to the number of pooled patients, as well as to the etiology of the analyzed PE in the two studies. Using ROC analysis, we determined the cut-off values of CA125, CA199, CEA, NSE, and SCC in serum and pleural fluid. However, their specificities in diagnosing MPE varied. Model 2 had better accuracy (86.92%) in terms of MPE diagnosis. Pleural fluid cut-off values for differential diagnosis were generally higher than those of serum; however, this finding does not justify routinely measuring classic TMs in the workup of PEs.",

In cases where MPE is suspected, but cytological findings are negative, the level of TMs in serum and pleural fluid, as well as the P/S ratio, should be evaluated before performing invasive procedures; this would help optimize the cost-benefit ratio. First, pleural CEA measurement is likely to be useful in diagnosing MPE, just as it is in the differentiation of malignant pleural mesothelioma from metastatic lung cancer -a high level of pleural CEA seems to rule out malignant mesothelioma. Second, CA125, CA199, NSE, and SCC are highly specific, but insufficiently sensitive to diagnose MPE, although the combination of more TMs appears to increase the diagnostic sensitivity.",
