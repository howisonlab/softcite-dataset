Forty human maxillary canines with straight canals were prepared according to a crown-down technique and enlarged to a#30 apical file size, before obturation with gutta-percha and a zinc-oxide-eugenol based sealer. The samples were stored for 3 months before being randomly assigned to four groups: chloroform (n=10), orange oil (n=10), eucalyptol (n=10) and control (n=10). Solvents were applied to a reservoir created on the coronal root third using Gates Glidden drills. The total time for retreatment using the solvents was 5 minutes per tooth. Following retreatment the roots were split longitudinally for SEM evaluation. SEM images were digitized, analyzed using Image ProPlus 4.5 software, and the number of dentinal tubules free of filling material from the middle and apical thirds was recorded. No significant difference was found among the solvent groups regarding the number of dentinal tubules free of root filling remnants in the middle and apical root thirds (p>0.05). However, the control group had fewer dentinal tubules free of filling material (p<0.05). Under the tested conditions, it may be concluded that there was no significant difference among the solvents used to obtain dentinal tubules free of filling material remnants."

This is accomplished during chemomechanical reinstrumentation. In order to remove filling materials without damage to the tooth, chemical solvents are used to solubilise gutta-percha 1,2,5 . Orange oil, eucalyptol, xylol, chloroform, halothane, and rectified turpentine have all been used as adjuncts to remove endodontic filling materials 13,15,16,21 . Retreatment has also been done combining heat with a solvent, in order to remove filling material from thermafilobturated teeth 33 . It has been shown that ultrasonic instrumentation required significantly less time to remove root fillings than hand instrumentation 16 Others authors have shown that rotary instruments remove more filling materials during endodontic retreatment than manual instruments 3,12,17 .",

A mean time of 1.5-10.8 minutes have been reported in laboratorial studies for retreatment of canals filled with laterally condensed gutta-percha and sealer 6,18,20,30 . Our study allowed 5 minutes to remove the obturation material. In this study, samples were maintained at 100% humidity at 37\u00b0C for 3 months to simulate oral conditions 22 , prior to retreatment. However, studies have used different storage times, ranging from 2 to 3 weeks 6,20 .
