The essence of Keynesian theories is that in the short-run the willingness of agents to absorb the output of the economy determines the quantity of output produced. On the other hand, classical and new classical theories do not allow the possibility that output can deviate from capacity, except for very short intervals. In these theories, prices and rates of return adjust so that a change in aggregate demand does not cause output to change. Here, we attempt to quantify the sources of economic fluctuations by making minimal and plausible identifying restrictions that do not depend on a theory of the business cycle.",

This dichotomy lies at the heart of most Keynesian and rational expectations models.1 In these models, shocks to aggregate demand temporarily move the economy away from some \"full-employment\" \"potential,\" or \"natural\" level of output. The natural level of output is determined by the capital stock, the labor force, and technology in long-run equilibrium.2 These supply-side factors are assumed to be independent of the business cycle phenomenon. This dichotomy, which is 1. Textbook treatments of Keynesian economics treat business cycles as fluctuations around a long-term deterministic trend. Sophisticated Keynesian macroeconometric models, such as the Fair model, incorporate a production function that determines output in the long-run. Rational expectations with misperceptions models of the cycle (Lucas, 1973) also have monetary impulses that move output temporarily from a trend level. 2. In Milton Friedman's (1968) words, the natural rate is \"ground out by the Walrasian system of general equilibrium equations\" (p. 8) even if unexpected monetary disturbances move output in the short-run (p. 9).",

This business cycle/growth dichotomy has been vitiated by new research on two fronts. First, research on the time series properties of main economic aggregates indicates that output can be characterized as following an integrated process.3 Extracting the long-run trend from data generated by integrated process cannot be accomplished by simple regression detrending methods. Auxiliary assumptions concerning the covariation of the trend and cyclical components of the data are necessary. Once covariation of the trend and cyclical components is allowed, the rationale for detrending loses much of its appeal.",

In this model, long-run movements in output can be attributed entirely to exogenous changes in labor input and technological progress. In the short-run, output may deviate from its long-run steady state value. These deviations may arise from shocks to the permanent levels of labor input and technology, which lead to a transition from one steady state to another, or they may be caused by aggregate demand disturbances. Hence, movements in output arise from three sources: labor supply disturbances, technological disturbances, and aggregate demand disturbances. The first two of these-the supply shocks-have a permanent effect on the level of output; the third has only a temporary effect.",

This assumption allows us to determine the historical influence of aggregate demand and aggregate supply on the variables in the model. The second identifying restriction is that the long-run level of labor supply is exogenous. This assumption allows us to divide the aggregate supply effect into 5. Blanchard and Quah (1988) use this assumption in a bivariate model of output and unemployment. They assume that output is integrated, but that unemployment is stationary, and that supply shocks are responsible for the stochastic growth component of output. Other researchers have relied on the distinction between permanent and transitory shocks for identification. Campbell and Mankiw (1987b) identify long-run movements in output as the part of output orthogonal to unemployment changes. King, et al. (1987) identify the long-run movement in output as the common long-run component in output, consumption, and investment.

Our goal in the empirical analysis is to use the observed data to estimate the disturbances wo and the moving average polynomial C(L). To do so, we appeal to identifying assumptions derived from the model in Section 2. The classical approach to the identification problem is to impose exclusion restrictions in the equations so that \"endogenous\" variables have no effect on \"exogenous\" variables, and specific exogenous variables affect some, but not all of the endogenous variables. Criticisms of these restrictions are well known. In rational expectations models, restrictions across the coefficients in D(L) and covariance restrictions on the matrix of structural disturbances are used to identify the model. These restrictions typically impose tight constraints on the dynamics of the model. In \"structural\" VAR approaches (Bernanke (1986), Blanchard and Watson (1986), or Sims (1986)), the dynamics of the model are left uncon-strained and identification is achieved by imposing constraints on contemporaneous relations of the data through D(O) and the covariance matrix of ot.

The Appendix gives the details of the sources of the data. Estimates reported in this paper are based on quarterly U.S. data from 1951:1. Data before 1951 are used as initial conditions in autoregressions. The end of the sample period is discussed below. The data for labor hours, output, and price are for the nonfarm private economy, excluding housing. We choose output for the nonfarm, non-housing private sector, rather than the whole economy because there are serious conceptual difficulties in relating the output to the inputs of housing, government, and farms. Housing and government are imputed in the national accounts. Farmers are largely self-employed, so measures of their hours of work are unreliable. Moreover, studying the nonfarm business sector allows us to abstract from the major changes in aggregate labor productivity caused by workers leaving farms.14 4.2. DATA ANALYSIS Our modelling and estimation strategy depends critically on the correct differencing of our time series. In Table 1 we present a variety of unit root test statistics that underlie our choice of specification. In the top panel we present the familiar Dickey-Fuller t-statistics, which test for a root of unity, versus a root less than unity. In the next column we present the largest estimated root from a sixth order autoregression, denoted by ^. In the hours, output, and productivity regressions we included a time trend in the autoregression to eliminate deterministic drift in these series. The tstatistics for hours, output, labor productivity, inflation, and interest rates are far less extreme than the 10 percent critical values. The estimated values of ^ are less than unity, but under the null hypothesis of a unit root, these estimates have a substantial negative bias. As pointed out in Schwert (1987), this bias is particularly severe when the first differences of the data have a large moving average component. Such moving average components might explain the small value of P for inflation. Unit root tests cannot be performed on the unobserved ex ante real interest rate; we present results for the ex post real rate. Since the null hypothesis of a unit root in the ex ante real rate implies a unit root in the ex post real rate, little is lost in this substitution. The results for the ex post real interest rate i,rt,1 are qualitatively different from the results for the other variables. The Dickey-Fuller t-statistic is much closer to the 10 percent critical value (its p-value is approximately 12 percent), and the estimated value of p is only 0.81. Thus, there is stronger evidence supporting the hypothesis that the real rate is stationary than there is supporting the hypothesis that the other variables are stationary.",

The univariate results for the nominal interest rate suggest that either inflation or the real rate has a root very close to unity. If the large root is less than one, then an expectations theory of the term structure suggests that interest rates should become more stationary (that is, have smaller AR(1) coefficients) as the term increases. But, interest rates do not get more stationary as the term increases. The values of i for 6-month, 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 20-year nominal Federal interest rates vary between 0.96 and 0.98.

Initially, we carried out the analysis using data through 1987:2, but it quickly became obvious that this led to a   1974-1975 and 1979-1981 periods of negative covariation misses the possibility that the dynamic response of the variables in the model is different for oil price decreases than it is for oil price increases. The most straightforward way to allow for this asymmetric response is to interact the lags of oil prices over the 1986-1987 period with a dummy variable. Since we allow six lags of oil prices in our model, full interaction of the lags with the dummy variable over the 1986:1-1987:2 period results in a perfect fit over that period. Consequently, we present results for the estimated model using data through 1985:4. The results for the estimated model are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2. The graphs give the response of the logs of labor, output, the price level, inflation, and the nominal and ex ante real interest rates to shocks in labor supply, oil and technology.15 The impulse responses are normalized as follows: the labor supply shock has a unit long-run impact on hours, the oil shock represents a 1 percent increase in oil prices, and the technology shock has a long-run impact of 1.6 on output. The long-run elasticity of output with respect to technology is 1/a (see equation 2.5). Since the share of labor averages approximately 0.625, our impulse response functions trace out the effect of a 1 percent long-run increase in technology.",

Using the estimated model through 1985:4, the oil price decline during 1986 provides a dramatic stimulus to growth. Actual output growth was sluggish, so the positive stimulus from oil is countered by large negative contributions from labor and technology. Given the sharp drops in output following the oil shocks of the 1970's, as well as during the pre-OPEC era (Hamilton, 1983), our model predicts a strong increase in output following the big decline in oil prices in 1986. Given that the boom did not occur during that period of time, our procedure offsets the positive effect of the oil price decrease on output with negative shocks to the other components that permanently affect output. As noted above, one would like to accommodate this episode by allowing for an asymmetric response of output to oil prices. Given that oil prices fell by a large amount only once in the sample, it is not possible to estimate such an asymmetric response.",

Our findings are based on a simple, standard, and widely accepted model of long-term growth on which business cycle dynamics are superimposed.

Campbell and Mankiw (1987a) discuss the difficulties in estimating processes where a unit MA root might cancel an over-differenced dependent variable. For aggregate GNP, their results indicate that it is difficult to distinguish the trend-stationary AR(2) model from the ARIMA (1,1,1).

Were there a unit moving average root in the hours equation of the vector system, there would also be one in the univariate equation. Although the univariate test is not as powerful as a multivariate test, and we have explored only a limited number of ARIMA models, the univariate estimates do suggest that excluding MA components from the VAR estimates is not a serious problem.

That is, there is significant downward bias in ^ when the true value of p is close to one. On the other hand, despite the bias in the estimate of p, one also cannot reject the hypothesis that hours are borderline-stationary. Prior knowledge is needed to resolve the problem. One possible prior is that the true underlying trend in hours comes from population growth whose trend is very smooth and is likely to be well-approximated by a deterministic function of time. An alternative prior is that the stochastic growth component in hours is trivially small compared to its stationary component.

We view the estimates with detrended labor as an extreme but instructive case. They show the consequence of a prior that the stochastic trend in labor has low variance by taking the extreme position that the variance is zero. The trend-stationary model is a special case of our basic model with stochastic labor, but with the variance of the long-run component in labor set to zero. An econometric difficulty (estimating a loosely parameterized vector ARMA model) necessitates estimating the trend-stationary model as a separate, special case. In principle, it is nested by the stochastic trend model. If we estimate the stochastic labor model with labor differenced (and, in fact, the process is trend stationary) the estimated process will have a unit-moving average root, which should undifference the labor model. Yet, because we do not have explicit moving average components in our estimation, this undifferencing cannot take place in practice. Specifically, the model with trend-stationary labor is as follows: Hours are assumed to be stationary around a deterministic trend. Output is still integrated, since we maintain the assumption that productivity is integrated.26 Since detrended hours are now stationary, there are now three transitory shocks in the model. We now associate these shocks with aggregate demand. Oil prices and technology permanently affect the level of output. A summary of the results for this model can be found in Figures 5 and 6 and in Table 3. 26. From Table 1, the estimated ^ for average productivity is 0.98.

Oil explains roughly the same fraction of output as it does in the model with differenced-stationary hours. The contributions from aggregate demand and technology are substantially different. In this model, aggregate demand explains 90 percent of output over the first year, and 80 percent at the 8 quarter horizon. Indeed even though we constrain aggregate demand to have no long-run effect on output, it still accounts for roughly 35 percent of the variability of output at the 8-year horizon.

It might seem consistent with our modelling strategy to assume that the long-run changes in the Solow residual measure long-run changes in technology. But a difficulty arises in using the Solow residual because it is inherently measured as a rate of change. If this measure contains errors due either to data or specification problems, these errors will accumulate in the measures of the level of technology. Hence, the accumulated Solow residual will contain a permanent component that is attributable to measurement error in addition to the permanent component that represents technological progress. Such difficulties could arise from measurement issues alone. Specifically, transitory measurement error in capital accumulation leads to a permanent error in the accumulated Solow residual. Additionally, if measured input flows  are not always equal to input services (labor is hoarded) then the accumulated Solow residual will have a permanent component similar to that arising from measurement error. Similarly, Hall (1988) shows that the measured Solow residual contains a business cycle component if the assumption of perfect competition is incorrect.  Despite these difficulties in explicitly incorporating the Solow residual into the model, it is interesting to see how our estimated technological shock relates to this widely-studied measure of technological progress. In the previous paragraph we suggest that the relationship at high frequencies is likely to be weak. Yet, if the measurement errors are fairly small, one might expect to find a relationship in the long-run between the Solow residual and our technological shock. We compute the fraction of variance at frequency zero of the Solow residual accounted for by our estimated shocks to technology.27 In brief, we find that our technological shocks are closely related to the Solow residual at low frequencies. For our basic model with differenced-stationary hours, the technological shock accounts for 62 percent of the variation of the Solow residual in the long-run; for the model with trend-stationary labor, that figure is 75 percent.28 Therefore, we 27.

With our data, the ratio wanders between 1.04 at the beginning of the sample to 0.85 at the end of the sample. Its sample path looks more like a random walk than stationary oscillations around a constant mean. We are skeptical that building a variable output-capital ratio into our model would be fruitful. The mean and variance of its drift is small relative to the other drifts in the model, so we believe that ignoring it does not substantially affect our results.",

The researcher can estimate the model in levels and let the VAR estimate unit roots if it chooses. Inference issues can be subtle, but many of the usual inference procedures are asymptotically valid even in the presence of unit roots and cointegration. Identification procedures, such as ours, that rely on the long-run multipliers depend critically on the location of unit roots. So, for example, we have already seen how the results can change when the assumption that hours are difference stationary is changed. In addition, our assumption that inflation contains a unit root is not innocuous. We have estimated a modification of our five variable system replacing 7rt = (1 -L)pt with (1 -AL)pt where A is estimated by maximum likelihood. We find that values of A greater than 0.9 provide local 29. See Shapiro (1987) for further discussion and evidence that the Solow residual is a good measure of technological innovations despite the potential presence of cyclical errors. 30.

Adverse technological shocks are not an important factor in recessions except for the recession in 1970, which roughly coincides with the beginning of the productivity slowdown. Favorable technological shocks play an important role in explaining strong growth in the 1960s.

Our basic model with stochastic trend could have told us that variance of the trend is small. Indeed, had we allowed for unit moving average roots in the estimates, the trend-stationary case is nested in the basic model with stochastic trend. We do not find a unit moving average root in the univariate ARIMA model for hours, and so we believe that explicitly incorporating moving average components into the model would not alter the results.",

In the model with deterministic labor, aggregate demand is very important in explaining output at business cycle frequencies and has a very persistent effect on output. This result arises because the low frequency, high variance, autonomous movements in labor input are attributed to aggregate demand rather than labor supply. Because taking out a deterministic trend is an overly stringent way of imposing the prior that labor supply shocks are smooth, these estimates provide a loose upper bound on the contribution of aggregate demand to output fluctuations.",

Yet, we would not want to label these shocks as aggregate demand, as is done effectively in the trend-stationary estimates. The estimated labor supply shocks are autonomous movements in labor input. The estimates take into account Okun's law by purging the estimated labor shock of movements in hours that can be explained by business cycle frequency movements in output and other variables. A theory that would attribute these shocks to aggregate demand must be able to explain why there are large movements in hours that are not explained by movements in output.",

The net capital stock on a constant dollar basis for nonfarm business is available on an end-of-year, not end-of-quarter basis (see August 1987 Survey of Current Business, for example). We calculate the quarter-to-quarter changes in the capital stock by using the quarterly gross investment series (gross private domestic nonfarm fixed investment) from the NIPA. We know the net change in the capital stock over the year from the annual capital stock data. We use this information to convert the gross flows to net flows by assuming that the ratio of gross to net investment is the same within each quarter of a given year. The compensation for nonfarm private business employees is also only available annually (Table 6.4 of the NIPA). We add to employee compensation of proprietor's income (net of depreciation) to arrive at the annual estimate of si. The quarterly figure is then defined as a weighted average of the previous years and the current years share. The weights for the first quarter are 3/4 on the previous year and 1/4 on the current year; for the second quarter are 1/2 and 1/2; for the third 1/4 and 3/4; and 0 and 1 for the fourth quarter.

This decomposition picks out a different linear combination of the aggregate demand shocks, but since only their joint effect is identified, this difference is inessential. 13.Blanchard and Quah (1988) use a different technique to estimate models subject to these long-run Wold causal orderings. They estimate the unrestricted vector autoregression for X, and then transform the system by post-multiplying the VAR by a matrix that imposes the necessary restrictions on the long-run multipliers and the residual covariance matrix. There is unique matrix that simultaneously diagonalizes the VAR innovation covariance matrix and triangularizes the matrix of long-run multipliers. When the only constraints on the system are a lower triangular matrix of long-run multipliers and a diagonal innovation covariance matrix, the model is just-identified, and this procedure can be thought of as \"indirect least squares.\" The instrumental variable approach that we outline can be thought of as two stage least squares. When the model is just-identified, these two estimation methods produce identical estimators and are equivalent to the FIML estimator. The model that we estimate is overidentified. In particular, oil prices are assumed to be strictly exogenous, and this imposes overidentifying restrictions. These overidentifying restrictions are easy to impose in our instrumental variable approach, but are much more difficult to impose in the indirect least squares approach.This content downloaded from 146.006.168.120 on May 18, 2018 14:21:07 PM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).",

Macro is interested in the fundamental sources of economic fluctuations, whereas micro almost always considers movements of one actor or one market as the result of changes elsewhere in the economy. In this paper, Shapiro and Watson tackle the issue of driving forces head on. Their menu of alternative sources of fluctuations contains aggregate demand shocks, shifts of technology, movements of oil prices, and shifts of labor supply. The big surprise in the paper is that labor supply shocks are important not only in the longer-run movements of the economy, but also in the shorter-run business cycle. Neither of the major schools of macroeconomic thinking active today--real business cycles or modern Keynesianism-puts any weight on labor supply as a driving force. Taken at face value, Shapiro and Watson's results call for a major rethinking of macroeconomics.",

Following Blanchard and Quah, Shapiro and Watson use timing properties to achieve identification. Their setup requires that all long-run effects on output come either from labor supply or from oil. They claim that fairly general theoretical considerations support this identifying assumption. Certainly it can be true of the Solow growth model, where labor supply is the dominant determinant of output in the long-run. What is surprising about Shapiro and Watson's findings, however, is that shifts in labor supply are an important determinant of output in business cycle frequencies.",
