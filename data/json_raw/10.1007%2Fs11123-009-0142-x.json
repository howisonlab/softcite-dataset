It is generally based on a ''frontier'' production function that represents the maximum output quantities attainable from each set of input quantities (Coelli et al. 2005). This methodology accounts for the fact that not all producers succeed in optimizing their production processes and might not achieve the maximum output level given their input quantities. It is often used to explore and compare the (relative) efficiencies of different producers and to determine factors that influence the producer's efficiency.",

The non-parametric non-stochastic Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) implicitly imposes monotonicity while the parametric Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) with flexible functional forms generally disregards this condition. Many empirical applications of SFA present results in which the monotonicity condition is not fulfilled, despite its importance (Sauer et al. 2006). Although procedures for imposing monotonicity of frontier functions have been proposed in the literature, they are rarely used 1 -probably because these procedures are rather complex and laborious.

However, quasiconcave production functions do not guarantee that the input demand functions are ''everywhere'' differentiable (Dhrymes 1967;Barten et al. 1969). 2  If all inputs are perfectly divisible and different production activities can be applied independently, production functions are generally quasiconcave (e.g. Varian 1992). Furthermore, a non-quasiconcave point of the production function cannot reflect profit-maximizing behavior under standard microeconomic assumptions. However, the assumptions of perfectly divisible inputs and independent applicability of different production activities are not always fulfilled in the real world and measuring technical efficiency generally assumes only that producers maximize output given their input quantities but not that producers maximize their profit. Hence, in contrast to the monotonicity assumption, there is not necessarily a technical rationale for production functions to be quasiconcave. Moreover, even a non-quasiconcave point of the production function might reflect profit-maximizing behavior if not all of the prices are exogenously given or there are restrictions on input use (e.g. fertilizer use in water protection areas).",

One approach is a restricted maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, i.e. the likelihood function is maximized subject to the restriction that the theoretically derived properties of the frontier function are fulfilled. For instance, Bokusheva and Hockmann (2006) estimate a translog production frontier under monotonicity and quasi-concavity restrictions. However, they impose these restrictions only locally at the sample mean, which is not sufficient for obtaining reasonable efficiency estimates (see above). Furthermore, the maximization of the likelihood function under constraints is rather complex and the algorithms used for the optimization frequently have convergence problems or converge to local maxima. As another solution, O'Donnell and  use the Bayesian MCMC method to estimate a stochastic frontier distance function with all desirable theoretical conditions imposed at all data points. This is probably the most suitable and most sophisticated approach, but it is rather complex and laborious.",

Many coefficients have changed considerably (column ''diff''), but all changes are less than two times the standard error of the first-step estimation (column ''diff/std.err''). The last column (''adj.coef'') shows the restricted coefficients after adjusting the production frontier with a 0 and a 1 estimated in the final step. Of course, the monotonicity condition is fulfilled at all observations now. Moreover, the quasiconcavity condition also is fulfilled at all observations. Interestingly, we obtained the same result, i.e. imposing monotonicity implies quasiconcavity, also for other empirical applications (e.g. Wiebusch 2005;Henning and Mumm 2009;Henning and Han 2009). Barnett (2002) argues that imposing curvature but not monotonicity increases the incidence of monotonicity violations. Hence, imposing monotonicity first and checking for curvature thereafter-as in our approach-seems more effective than imposing curvature alone. However, monotonicity has a closer relationship to quasiconcavity than to concavity (see above) so that it is questionable if imposing monotonicity generally implies concavity in empirical applications.",

Given the importance of monotonicity we suggest that non-monotone production frontiers should no longer be used in empirical production analysis, particularly since we have proposed a three-step procedure that is much simpler than existing approaches. We show that imposing monotonicity at one point is not sufficient to obtain reasonable efficiency estimates and we demonstrate how monotonicity of a flexible translog function can be imposed on a closed set (region) of input quantities. Our three-step method can be used to impose theoretical consistency not only on translog production frontiers but also on other functional forms and other frontier functions such as distance, cost, or profit frontiers. Although the theoretical restrictions for these functions are more complex than the monotonicity restrictions of a translog partial production elasticities of fertilizer (unrestricted model) partial production elasticities of fertilizer (restricted model) Fig. 7 Partial production elasticities of fertilizer. Note: the unfilled circles indicate observations with monotonicity violated in the unrestrestricted model production frontier, our proposed three-step procedure still is probably less complex than a restricted ML or a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation.
