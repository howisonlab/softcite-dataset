            "text": "In 2010, The Global Fund introduced subsidised artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) to the retail sector of eight pilot countries in order to improve access to effective, first-line therapy for the millions of suspected malaria cases that seek treatment over-the-counter. 1 In Kenya, the retail price of ACT dropped by 78% and the market share of ACTs increased from 12% to 61% 2 as a result of the programme. Subsidised ACTs have now become widely available in the retail sector in many malaria endemic countries. However, there is concern that dramatically lowering the price of ACTs opened the door to overtreatment and overuse. 3 Very few of the millions of suspected malaria cases treated in the retail sector receive a diagnostic test. This leads to poor targeting of ACT as demonstrated by studies in Tanzania and Uganda which documented that individuals without malaria purchase 66-80% of subsidised ACTs, while 70% of those with malaria do not purchase an ACT. 4 5 This mismatch between who needs an ACT and who takes an ACT highlights the importance of expanding testing before treatment to reach those who purchase ACTs over-the-counter. Ideally, incorporating diagnosis into a subsidy programme would enable targeting of ACT subsidies to those with confirmed malaria infection, thus reducing overuse of ACTs and reducing the cost of the subsidy programme per patient treated. Appropriate use of ACTs may also improve community-wide adoption through a positive social learning feedback loop. 6 However, there is little evidence to guide policymakers in the implementation of diagnostic testing within a subsidy framework in the retail sector. Existing evidence indicates that subsidising treatments such as ACTs can lead to overuse 3 but subsidising preventive health interventions can expand uptake without compromising usage. 7 It is not clear whether subsidies for diagnostic testing would follow the latter trend and what effect they might have on ACT consumption. In addition, the interaction between ACT and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) subsidies and how the price of each could be manipulated to increase the value of both interventions has not been explored. One example from a cancer screening and treatment experiment demonstrates that advanced information about availability of subsidised treatment, conditional on diagnostic testing, can improve uptake of testing. 8 Here, we sought to study the relationship between a subsidised diagnostic test and a conditionally subsidised treatment intervention in order to understand how ACTs can be targeted to malaria cases in the retail sector. We designed an individually randomised experiment to determine the effect of a conditional subsidy for ACT on the decision to be tested for malaria when the test is subsidised or not, and the subsequent effect of the test on drug purchasing decisions. Our primary hypothesis was that clients who learn they will receive an ACT subsidy conditional on a positive test are more likely to opt for testing before deciding which drug to buy. Secondary end points include the effect of the diagnostic test subsidy on uptake of testing, and the effect of testing and antimalarial subsidy on subsequent drug purchasing decisions.",

We compared baseline covariates to examine the balance between intervention and control arms using count and percentages for categorical variables and median and IQR for continuous variables. We compared the same set of baseline covariates to determine whether loss to follow-up differed according to observed variables, including the study group. Proportions of participants who opted in for testing, were tested positive/negative, and took an ACT were compared by the study group. All primary end points are individual-level binary outcomes, modelled using a linear probability model (LPM), allowing us to interpret model parameters as probability differences. The LPM was specified as a generalised linear model for a binomial outcome with an identity link function. We summarised testing choice by the four randomised study groups by regressing the binary outcome on two factors (RDT subsidy and ACT subsidy) and their interaction to match the randomised 2\u00d72 factorial study design. 9 In addition to unadjusted group effects, we specified models with a full set of prespecified predictors: gender and age of the client, occupation and education level of the client or guardian (if client <18 years), household size, wealth, and sublocation. Wealth was assessed as a composite score based on principal component analysis of ownership of basic household assets, using a polychoric correlation matrix to account for the categorical nature of the included assets. 10 The poorest 40% of participants were used as the comparator group. 11 For the secondary end point of ACT consumption (an individual-level binary outcome) we used the same LPM modelling approach as for the testing-related outcomes. Models were stratified by test results for the subsample of clients who opted for a test. Since the interaction term was not significant in any of these models or in the primary testing outcome models, we excluded it in order to gain power and to improve model interpretation. Similarly, because we had not powered our study for these secondary end points, we reduced the set of prespecified predictors included in the primary outcome to the most parsimonious model with the best fit. To do so, we performed likelihood ratio tests and compared Akaike information criterion for subsets of the prespecified predictors. 12 The reduced set included wealth index only. Therefore, we only present the adjustment for the parsimonious model for the secondary end points and provide results from this parsimonious set for the primary outcome for comparison. Since testing outcomes relied on self-reports of testing behaviour, we conducted sensitivity analyses to determine whether model results persisted when the outcome was malaria testing at the CHW only (rather than the broader definition of any malaria test, including those conducted in a health facility) and when there was documented proof of the malaria test.",

In our study, appropriate ACT use following a test was highest when clients paid for their RDT and were given a conditional voucher for their ACT (Group C). However, uptake of testing in groups with access to unsubsidised RDTs was low compared to those who received a subsidised RDT. Therefore, overall targeting of ACTs in all participants was highest in the groups that received a free, fully subsidised RDT (42.5% and 39% in Groups C and D, respectively, compared to 56.1% and 57.3% in Groups A and B, respectively, table 2).",

            "text": "Consumption of first-line antimalarials has increased, partly due to the availability of subsidised ACTs in the retail sector in many malaria-endemic countries. The vast majority of ACTs paid for in the retail sector are taken presumptively without parasitological confirmation of malaria infection. It is not well understood how to improve the uptake of diagnostic testing among those seeking treatment over-the-counter. In order to maximise targeting of ACTs to confirmed malaria cases, we sought to test whether the RDT should be subsidised and whether ACT subsidy, conditional on a positive RDT test result, could improve appropriate use of ACTs. We find that both the RDT and ACT subsidies in this study had significant positive effects on appropriate fever management, indicating that price is still a major driving force behind these decisions. Fully subsidised RDTs made available in the community greatly improve uptake of testing before treatment. Although making a small payment for an RDT (ie, unsubsidised RDT) seemed to reduce inappropriate ACT use among malaria-negative participants, this benefit was negated by the large reduction in testing rates in the unsubsidised RDT groups. Providing an additional discount on an ACT drug, which is conditional on a positive RDT, improves the use of ACT by those with confirmed infection and increases targeting of ACTs overall. The percentage of malaria infections receiving appropriate treatment was 20 percentage points higher in the ACT subsidy group, suggesting that at the current retail prices, a significant number of malaria-positive individuals would decide not to purchase an ACT even after confirmation that they have malaria. However, the prior offer of a conditional ACT subsidy at the time of enrolment did not improve uptake of testing, regardless of the price of the RDT, indicating that study participants did not project future drug discount in a manner that influenced testing behaviour. We conclude that both subsidies are important, but only in determining the next immediate action. Overall, the randomised design of our study mitigates many concerns about bias. However, there are some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, it was somewhat difficult to find participants who were feeling ill, but had not yet sought treatment during our door-to-door canvassing. It is possible that the group we identified for enrolment had some systematic differences from the overall population of people who might experience a febrile illness. Second, our results are based on self-report at follow-up, which introduces concerns about recall bias and social desirability bias. Our 1-week follow-up window was short enough to minimise recall bias 13 and we were able to confirm testing results by documentation of the test result in nearly 90% of cases. However, we were not able to confirm the drug purchases for most individuals unless they used a study voucher. We note that despite introducing an extra step into the treatment-seeking sequence (CHW and then a shop), uptake of testing was high when the test was offered at no charge to the participant. This possibly reflects the ease of accessing testing through a community member. However, response to the testing intervention may have been motivated partly out of curiosity or desire to interact with a novel experience or opportunity. This may have biased the RDT treatment effect and it may have reduced adherence to the RDT results, which could partially explain the high non-adherence to the RDT in the double subsidy group. It is also possible that information about subsidies offered to other groups influenced individual behaviour. Since it was not possible for participants to be blinded to the intervention (theirs or others'), we are unable to estimate placebo effects or rule out potential behavioural responses to individuals getting information about other treatment arms or subsidy levels. Finally, although our initial group allocation was random, the decision to get tested and the subsequent information received from testing are no longer random due to selection effects. This imbalance across arms subsequent to the first action (whether to get tested or not) could introduce bias in the estimation of treatment effects on ACT consumption. Although we did not observe systematic differences between subgroups (tested or not, those taking ACT or not) it is possible that the groups differ on unobserved characteristics such as preferences or beliefs about their illness or perceptions derived from previous experience with RDTs or ACTs.",

            "text": "In previous studies it has been shown that between 36% and 77% of fever treated in the retail sector do not have malaria. 14 15 A study in Tanzania estimated that 80% of ACTs are sold to patients without parasitaemia and only 70% of parasitaemic patients paid for ACT. 16 The discordance between malaria and ACT consumption demonstrates the need for improved targeting of antimalarials sold in the retail sector. Recent studies that introduced RDTs into retail shops alongside subsidised ACTs have had mixed results. A study in Uganda reported low uptake of RDTs by retail shop owners and their customers and low adherence to test results. 17 Other studies have demonstrated higher uptake when the tests are highly subsidised and much less expensive than the available ACT. 18 There is some tension between motivation of the shop owner to make a profitable drug sale versus the expectation in most studies that an individual with a negative test would not be sold an antimalarial and would be referred to a health facility without a drug. This may even compromise the integrity of the testing; two studies documented high rates of false positives by RDT at the shops compared to a reference blood smear. 19 20 Offering testing at the community level through agents who are independent of the subsequent drug sale and who are known to the patient may mitigate this concern. Furthermore, in our study, shop participation was high and we encountered no major problems in administering targeted drug subsidies in this manner. We observed fairly high ACT use among untested clients, but not as high as other studies. In reports from other countries where subsidised ACTs are available over-the-counter; between 60% and 100% of untested clients paid for ACTs. [19][20][21] It is possible that the current price of ACTs in the retail sector in Kenya is prohibitive for some families. At the end of the AMFm pilot, the average price of ACT in Kenya was US$0.58 2 but the subsidy level has declined since the conclusion of the pilot and the current cost of an adult dose is about three times higher than the AMFm subsidised price. In support of this view, we note that our results agree with Cohen et al 22 who reported that 25% of untested clients purchasing ACT in Uganda where the price of ACT was four times higher than AMFm target prices. 2 Importantly, in all of our study groups, ACT *LPM models specified as a generalised linear model for a binomial outcome with an identity link function.

Malaria-negative participants in the double-subsidy group took an ACT more frequently than malaria-negative participants in any other group, and nearly as often as those untested, an observation for which we do not have a satisfying explanation. This is the first study that implements an antimalarial subsidy that is conditional on confirmatory testing. Antimalarial subsidies in the retail sector have improved access to effective treatment but may also increase inappropriate use of the drugs. Confirmatory diagnostic testing for malaria prior to treatment could improve targeting of subsidised ACTs, reducing their unnecessary use and lowering the per patient costs of a subsidy programme. In our study, both RDT subsidy and ACT subsidy ( provided conditional on a positive RDT) were independently linked to increases in appropriate fever management decisions, but adding the conditional ACT subsidy on top of the RDT subsidy did not influence the likelihood of malaria testing. We conclude that both subsidies are independently important, but only in relation to decision making on the next immediate treatment action targeted by the subsidy. A drug subsidy which is conditional on confirmatory testing is a promising approach for improving sustainability of publicly funded subsidies. However, more work is required to define the optimal relationship between diagnostic testing and subsidised ACTs sold over-the-counter, both in terms of the level of subsidy of each commodity as well as the mechanism of delivery.",
