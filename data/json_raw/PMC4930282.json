            "text": "Sepsis, a serious clinical problem, is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection and leads to organ failure. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is intimately implicated in hyper-inflammatory responses and tissue injury during sepsis. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective mechanisms of trichostatin A (TSA), a HDAC inhibitor, associated with TLR signaling pathway during sepsis. The anti-inflammatory properties of TSA were assayed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Polymicrobial sepsis was induced in mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), a clinically relevant model of sepsis. The mice were intraperitoneally received TSA (1, 2 or 5 mg/kg) 30 min before CLP. The serum and liver samples were collected 6 and 24-h after CLP. TSA inhibited the increased production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. TSA improved sepsis-induced mortality, attenuated liver injury and decreased serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels. CLP increased the levels of TLR4, TLR2 and myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) protein expression and association of MyD88 with TLR4 and TLR2, which were attenuated by TSA. CLP increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B and decreased cytosolic inhibitor of kappa B (I\u03baB) protein expression, which were attenuated by TSA. Moreover, CLP decreased acetylation of I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and increased association of IKK with I\u03baB and TSA attenuated these alterations. Our findings suggest that TSA attenuates liver injury by inhibiting TLR-mediated inflammatory response during sepsis.",

            "text": "Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome by infection, is life-threatening disease with high mortality and mobidity (Singhal et al., 2013). Severe sepsis is a leading cause of death in intensive care units and results in aggregate health care cost (Lagu et al., 2012). Despite continuous effort and research, effective pharmacologic agent for sepsis has not been developed. The complicated and ambiguous pathological mechanism of sepsis is one of the main causes of failure in management (Zhao et al., 2013). An uncontrolled hyperinflammatory response and improper cytokine response during sepsis have been proposed as the cause of multiple organ failure, which is most lethal complication of sepsis (Riedemann et al., 2003). Given the large abundance of resident macrophages and their extensive endothelial surfaces, the liver plays a prominent role in the host immune response to infection (Chen et al., 1996). Moreover, the liver is believed to be a vulnerable organ responsible for the initiation of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, which is the most lethal complication of sepsis (Bone, 1991).",

In polymicrobial sepsis, hepatic TLR4 and TLR2 mRNA expression increased compared with that in sham-operated mice (Williams et al., 2003) and TAK-242, a TLR4 inhibitor, improved survival in a murine model of sepsis (Sha et al., 2011). Moreover, TLR protein expression upregulated in septic patients compared with healthy individuals. Activation of TLRs rapidly recruits adaptor molecules and triggers inflammatory gene expression through downstream pathways. Recently, HDAC inhibitors have been reported to regulate diverse signaling pathways through post-translational modification of non-histone proteins. TSA inhibited up-regulation of myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) gene expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (Roger et al., 2011) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid suppressed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway through acetylation of MAPK phosphatase-1 (Finkelstein et al., 2010).",

TLR2deficient mice exhibited increased survival rates compared to wild type mice during sepsis (Bergt et al., 2013).

In the present study, the hepatic TLR4 and TLR2 protein expression significantly increased after CLP and TSA attenuated these increases. TLRs rapidly recruit adaptor molecules and trigger downstream signaling pathway after activation. Upon stimulation, adaptor molecules such as MyD88 and TRIF are recruited and subsequently lead to the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling. Deficiency of MyD88 suppressed inflammatory cytokines and protected mice in polymicrobial sepsis (Kawai et al., 1999).

            "text": "Activation of TLR leads to a multistep signaling process, which leads to NF-\u03baB signaling activation. NF-\u03baB plays a crucial role in pathophysiological process in sepsis via inducing the transcription of numerous inflammatory-related genes (Baldwin, 1996). Upon activation, I\u03baB is phosphorylated by the IKK and subsequently degraded by the proteasome resulting in NF-\u03baB activation (Beg et al., 1993). In septic patients, increased nuclear NF-\u03baB expression is associated with higher rates of mortality and worse clinical outcome (Abraham, 2003). Recently, HDAC inhibitors have been reported to interfere with the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. TSA inhibited the NF-\u03baB signaling via suppressing proteosomal degradation of I\u03baB (Chakravortty et al., 2000). Butyrate, a HDAC inhibitor, inhibited TNF-\u03b1-stimulated I\u03baB phosphorylation and degradation in the adenocarcinoma cells (L\u00fchrs et al., 2001). Moreover, YopJ, a Yeersinia outer protein, suppressed kinase activity of IKK by acetylation of the active loop of IKK, resulting in suppression of I\u03baB degradation (Mittal et al., 2006). It is interesting to note that in some instances, HDAC inhibitors have been reported to activate NF-\u03baB pathway. Acetylation at lysine 221 of p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB enhanced nuclear import of NF-\u03baB (Chen et al., 2002). In our study, CLP increased nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB and TSA attenuated this increase. TSA attenuated decrease in cytosolic I\u03baB protein expression in septic mice. Moreover, CLP decreased IKK acetylation and increased association of IKK with I\u03baB. These alterations were attenuated by TSA. These results suggest that TSA inhibits translocation of NF-\u03baB to nucleus via enhancing IKK acetylation.",
