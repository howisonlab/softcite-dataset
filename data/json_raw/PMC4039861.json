            "text": "Objectives: To develop an instrument to assess attitudes and underlying beliefs about back pain, and subsequently investigate its internal consistency and underlying structures. Design: The instrument was developed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and researchers based on analysis of qualitative interviews with people experiencing acute and chronic back pain. Exploratory analysis was conducted using data from a populationbased cross-sectional survey. Setting: Qualitative interviews with community-based participants and subsequent postal survey. Participants: Instrument development informed by interviews with 12 participants with acute back pain and 11 participants with chronic back pain. Data for exploratory analysis collected from New Zealand residents and citizens aged 18 years and above. 1000 participants were randomly selected from the New Zealand Electoral Roll. 602 valid responses were received. Measures: The 34-item Back Pain Attitudes Questionnaire (Back-PAQ) was developed. Internal consistency was evaluated by the Cronbach \u03b1 coefficient. Exploratory analysis investigated the structure of the data using Principal Component Analysis. Results: The 34-item long form of the scale had acceptable internal consistency (\u03b1=0.70; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.73). Exploratory analysis identified five two-item principal components which accounted for 74% of the variance in the reduced data set: 'vulnerability of the back'; 'relationship between back pain and injury'; 'activity participation while experiencing back pain'; 'prognosis of back pain' and 'psychological influences on recovery'. Internal consistency was acceptable for the reduced 10-item scale (\u03b1=0.61; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.66) and the identified components (\u03b1 between 0.50 and 0.78). Conclusions: The 34-item long form of the scale may be appropriate for use in future cross-sectional studies. The 10-item short form may be appropriate for use as a screening tool, or an outcome assessment instrument. Further testing of the 10-item Back-PAQ's construct validity, reliability, responsiveness to change and predictive ability needs to be conducted."

            "text": "Back pain is a significant health problem associated with very high direct and indirect costs. [1][2][3][4][5][6] The symptoms of back pain may persist for many months despite the absence of serious disease. [7][8][9] A small proportion of people develop chronic back pain which is responsible for the majority of costs associated with back pain. 4 Attitudes and beliefs are important factors in the development of back pain and disability. 10 11 Systematic reviews have found fear avoidance beliefs (movement or activity being avoided for fear of pain or injury) and low expectations of recovery (expecting a delayed return to work or persistent pain) are independently associated with poor outcomes, such as delayed return to work, activity limitation and pain persistence. 12 13 An improved understanding of the beliefs on which these constructs are based, and an ability to assess these in people who have back pain and the general public, could help to inform and target interventions to positively influence beliefs. Such interventions may, in turn, improve outcomes. 14 ",

Only the Back Beliefs Questionnaire 22 specifically relates to beliefs about back pain. Although developed and written for people with pain or the general public, many of these instruments have been adapted for assessing health professionals' beliefs. [23][24][25][26] The Health Care Providers Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (HC-PAIRS) is one of the most commonly used measures. 23 However, it assesses health professionals' views about people with back pain, rather than their own beliefs. Some researchers have also felt it necessary to append a disclaimer apologising for use of the term 'handicapped', which may be considered offensive. 27 Two questionnaires related to back pain have been developed specifically for health professionals: the Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physical Therapists (PABS-PT) 28 and the Attitudes to Back Pain Scale for musculoskeletal practitioners (ABS-mp). 29 The PABS-PT aims to discriminate between biomedical and biopsychosocial treatment orientations in the management of chronic low back pain. 28 This instrument was developed by adapting items from four questionnaires developed for patients, as well as items developed by the researchers. Consequently, many items focus on patient management rather than the therapist's own beliefs about back pain. A recent review found that evidence on the measurement properties of the PABS, although promising, was still lacking and required further investigation of content validity, interpretability and reliability. 30 The ABS-mp also focuses on clinicians' attitudes about managing back pain rather than their own beliefs about the back and back pain. As some of the items relate to the healthcare system, the authors advised caution if using outside of the UK. 29 In order to understand beliefs about back pain we have conducted in-depth interviews with people experiencing acute and chronic back pain. 18 These interviews have gone beyond the identification of attitudes associated with poor outcomes by identifying beliefs which underlie these constructs. These include the back being seen as vulnerable to injury and in need of protection.",

Each component was easily categorised, with four representing the original themes ('the vulnerability of the back', 'the relationship between back pain and injury', 'activity participation while experiencing back pain' and 'the prognosis of back pain'); an additional component ('psychological influences on recovery') had also emerged. Each of these components explained between 13.7% and 16.7% of the variance (table 3). Two of the original themes were lost; these were (1) 'the need to protect the back', and (2) 'the special nature of back pain'. A reduced component model was performed (forced model of four components) to see whether this resulted in a better fitting model. The model showed a reduction in overall variance explained (64.1%).

The original long form of the instrument (34-item) and the reduced short form (10-item) resulting from Principal Component Analysis were found to have adequate internal consistency.

This should contribute to the content validity of the instrument. Although health professionals and people without back pain did not participate in these interviews, subsequent interview research with general practitioners has demonstrated they hold many similar beliefs (manuscript under review); as such this instrument may also be appropriate for exploring health professionals' beliefs. It is hoped that use of the second person throughout the instrument will result in people without back pain and health professionals presenting their own beliefs, rather than projecting their beliefs onto people with back pain, or providing their beliefs about people with back pain. This feature may improve comparison of beliefs between groups. For many items, particularly those related to 'the need to protect the back' and 'the special nature of back pain', high proportions of respondents selected the most extreme option ('True'). Although this ceiling effect may limit the discriminative abilities of the 34-item long form Back-PAQ, responses indicate that beliefs about the need to have strong muscles, good posture and special lifting techniques are very commonly held, despite a lack of evidence to support them. These two original themes did not become part of the final 10-item short form Back-PAQ scale because they are nondiscriminating. Conceptually, the need to protect the back is related to the vulnerability of the back; this is reflected by one of the items in the final 'vulnerability' component coming from the original 'vulnerability' theme (item 6), and one from the 'protection' theme (item 11)."

For this reason, Varimax rotation was appropriate for analysing component loadings. The similar weightings that each of these components have is a strength of the instrument, with the hypothesis being that unhelpful beliefs on one component may be balanced out by helpful beliefs on another. Although widely used, and included in quality assessment criteria, 48 the use of \u03b1 to measure internal consistency is debated. 42 Low \u03b1 is not a reason to discard the scale, given the reasons for its deflation are known, and the very high proportion of variance explained by these five components (74%).",

However, this requires further testing by means of: confirmatory factor analyses among specific populations (eg, health professionals); examining convergent validity with existing instruments for assessing  beliefs in these three groups ( people with back pain, people without back pain and health professionals); and examining correlation with clinical behaviour among health professionals. The test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change also need to be assessed for each of these three groups. Finally, the predictive ability of the Back-PAQ on clinical outcomes needs to be examined for people with back pain and people who are painfree, as well as examining the influence of health professionals' beliefs (as measured by the Back-PAQ) on their patients' clinical outcomes. 48 Implications The 34-item long form of this instrument may be useful for conducting cross-sectional surveys in other countries. The 10-item short form of the instrument may be useful as either a research instrument to measure changes in beliefs, or as a screening tool to predict outcome or direct management. The novel scoring system for the Back-PAQ means that it is very easy to interpret. Negative scores indicate beliefs which are presumed to be unhelpful for recovery from back pain, and positive scores vice versa. The five components may also indicate to health professionals areas in which a patient has unhelpful beliefs, so that they may focus explanation and reassurance on these areas.",
