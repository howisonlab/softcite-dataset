Treatment with antiretroviral drugs is the best option for viral suppression, reducing morbidity and mortality. However, viral resistance in HIV-1 therapy has been reported. HIV-1 integrase (IN) is an essential enzyme for effective viral replication and an attractive target for the development of new inhibitors. In the study reported here, two-and three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D/3D-QSAR) studies, applying hologram quantitative structure-activity relationship (HQSAR) and comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) methods, respectively, were performed on a series of tricyclic phthalimide HIV-1 IN inhibitors. The best HQSAR model (q 2 = 0.802, r 2 = 0.972) was obtained using atoms, bonds, and connectivity as the fragment distinction, a fragment size of 2-5 atoms, hologram length of 61 bins, and six components. The best CoMFA model (q 2 = 0.748, r 2 = 0.974) was obtained with alignment of all atoms of the tricyclic phthalimide moiety (alignment II). The HQSAR contribution map identified that the carbonyl-hydroxy-aromatic nitrogen motif made a positive contribution to the activity of the compounds. Furthermore, CoMFA contour maps suggested that bulky groups in meta and para positions in the phenyl ring would increase the biological activity of this class. The conclusions of this work may lead to a better understanding of HIV-1 IN inhibition and contribute to the design of new and more potent derivatives.",

            "text": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a public health problem worldwide caused by the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is estimated that 33.3 million people are infected with HIV-1 and about 2.1 million deaths are reported every year that are related to AIDS. 1 HIV-1 infection is characterized by destruction of immune cells, especially T lymphocytes, which are responsible for the immune response against antigens, pathogens, and cancer cells. 2 The HIV-1 replication cycle depends on different macromolecules, including three viral enzymes, namely, reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase (IN). Currently, reverse transcriptase and protease are targets for several antiretroviral US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, such as efavirenz and indinavir, respectively, while for IN there are just two, raltegravir and elvitegravir. 3,4 Treatment with antiretroviral drugs is the best option for viral suppression, reducing morbidity and mortality. However, as viral resistance in HIV therapy has been reported, [5][6][7] additional therapeutic approaches are needed. 8 HIV-1 IN is one of three essential enzymes required for viral replication, and the absence of a host-cell equivalent target means that IN inhibitors may not interfere with cellular physiological process, suggesting that they are an attractive target for biological active compounds. 8 Thus, resistance to HIV-1 IN inhibitors is the greatest problem and the discovery of new potential inhibitors is essential for AIDS treatment. 5,7 In an attempt to design new chemical entities with efficient antiretroviral activity, we explored the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) molecular features of a series of tricyclic phthalimide HIV-1 IN inhibitors developed by Verschueren et al, 9 using two-and three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D/3D-QSAR) approaches, namely, hologram quantitative structureactivity relationship (HQSAR) 10 and comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) 11 methods, respectively, which are powerful ligand-based strategies in drug design. 12 ",

Two different alignments were performed and three models were generated from each one. The most active compound from the series (33) was used as the template for both alignments (Figure 1). In alignment I, all atoms of the tricyclic phthalimide moiety were chosen, except for the hydroxyl groups and external carbon atoms of the pyrazine ring. In alignment II, all atoms of tricyclic phthalimide moiety were chosen (Figure 1).",

Tripos standard and indicator force fields with a distance-dependent dielectric constant at all intersections in a regularly spaced grid (1 and 2 \u00c5) were evaluated (Tables 4 and 5). The default value of 30 kcal/mol was set as the maximum steric and electrostatic energy   showing HIV-1 IN inhibitory activity. The chemical structures and biological data of these inhibitors are listed in Table 1. The compounds' distribution in the training (30) and test (12) sets, an important step in the development of QSAR models, was careful, aiming to maximize the test set diversity and to analyze the model prediction accuracy. HQSAR studies require values to be selected for the parameters that specify the hologram length, as well as the size and type of fragments to be encoded. 16 The molecular fragments were generated using the following fragment distinction parameters: atoms, bonds, connections, hydrogen atoms, chirality, and donor/acceptor atoms. The HQSAR models were first generated using the default fragment size (4-7 atoms) combined with various fragment types and various hologram lengths ( Table 2). To identify how the fragment size could influence the statistical parameters, we tested different fragment sizes (2-5, 3-6, 4-7, 5-8, 6-9, and 7-10 atoms) on the three best fragment distinction parameters of this model having the highest statistical indexes (models 1, 10, and 15) ( Table 2). The best HQSAR model for these HIV-1 IN inhibitors was found to be model 28, with atoms, bonds, and connectivity as the fragment distinction parameters, and 2-5 atoms as the fragment size, showing good predictive capacity (q 2 = 0.802), high data fitting (r 2 = 0.972), and low cross-validated standard error (SE cv = 0.340) ( Table 3).",

This code ranges from red to green in a spectrum indicating favorable (yellow, green blue, and green), neutral (white), and unfavorable (red, red orange, and orange) contributions ( Figure 2). The fragment contribution map of the most active compound, 33, shows no fragments with negative contribution (Figure 2). As can be seen, the carbonyl-hydroxy-aromatic nitrogen motif was colored white and green, indicating neutral and positive contributions to activity, respectively, since this moiety is common for all compounds and provides a structural scaffold for holding the pharmacophoric groups in suitable orientation for maximum complementarity with the catalytic site of HIV-1 IN. 9 Furthermore, the carbonyl and hydroxyl oxygens could chelate the Mg 2+ ion in the active site, an essential interaction for enzyme inhibition. 9,17,18 In addition, the methylene spacer (colored green) that links the phthalimide nitrogen to the 3,4-dichlorophenyl group (mostly colored green and yellow) in compound 33 appears to be important for directing this bulky aromatic group in the active site of the enzyme, as suggested by docking studies. 7 This is consistent with benzodioxoles 13, 14, and 15, since the compound with one methylene spacer (14) was more potent than that with none (13) or with two (15) methylene spacers. 7 ",

The contributions of the green and yellow contours were maintained at the default values of 80% and 20%, respectively. Figure 3A shows two favorable green regions for compound 33 located close to the meta and para positions of the benzyl group (R1 substituent), mainly near the two (orto and para) chlorine atoms. This indicates that bulky groups at those positions are favorable and this accounts for the high biological activity of 33. The several unfavorable yellow regions spread around the benzyl group indicate that bulky groups at those positions would significantly reduce the binding affinity. In the contour map of the most active compound, 33 ( Figure 3A), it can be observed that the benzyl group is planar and does not touch the yellow regions, while in the map of the least active compound, 8 ( Figure 3B), the piperidine ring (R1 substituent) is localized in the yellow prohibitive regions.",

Derivative 1 is analogous to 26, one of the most potent tricyclic phthalimide inhibitors, and both have the same 4-fluorobenzyl group as the R1 substituent, differing only in the first ring ( Table 1). The HQSAR models overestimated the biological potency of 1 probably because it has a similar fingerprint to compound 26.",

The CoMFA model emphasized the importance of the steric descriptor field, as it explained nearly 97% of the variance in HIV-1 IN inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activities of the external test set of compounds were well predicted and explain the statistical robustness of the CoMFA and HQSAR models created. This could be useful in the development of newer molecules that are structurally related to these HIV-1 IN inhibitors. The CoMFA contour map analysis showed two favorable green regions located close to the meta and para positions of the benzyl group (R1 substituent), mainly near the two (orto and para) chlorine atoms for compound 33. This indicates that bulky groups at those positions are favorable for activity, which accounts for the increased activity of the inhibitors in this series. A successful HQSAR model should provide important information about which molecular fragments are directly related to the biological activity, apart from predicting the activities of the untested molecules. Together, these data would be useful for designing new compounds with potent HIV-1 IN inhibitory activity.",
