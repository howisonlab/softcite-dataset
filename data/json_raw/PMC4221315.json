Given the increase in breast cancer survival rates, investigations of factors influencing the quality of life of survivors have gained importance. Therefore, the objective of our study was to characterize oral health in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. METHODS: We conducted a matched case-control study. Forty-eight women who survived breast cancer (age 62.1\u00a19.1 years) and 48 healthy controls (age 61.8\u00a18.6 years) were included. For each case and control, a complete oral evaluation chart was completed. RESULTS: The prevalence of chronic periodontal disease was 98% in breast cancer survivors and 87% in controls. The breast cancer survivors had a median of 16 remaining teeth, whereas controls had a median of 22 remaining teeth (p = 0.03). The percentage of sites with gingival bleeding was 16.05% (0-100%) in breast cancer survivors and 0% (0-72%) in controls (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Chronic periodontal disease and tooth loss were highly prevalent in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. To improve survivors' quality of life, a preventive oral health evaluation should be available prior to cancer treatment.",

This epidemiological change can be attributed to a combination of screening programs and improvements in adjuvant therapy (3). In this context, an important issue faced by clinicians caring for these women is how to improve their long-term quality of life. Many latent clinical disorders can emerge during or after cancer treatment that eventually may attenuate the survival gains obtained via recent advances in curative-intent therapies (4).",

Overall, 87% of the individuals in our control group had CPD; this prevalence is comparable to that observed in Germany (10) and higher than that observed in the U.S. (12). The association between breast cancer treatment and oral health has not previously been explored, but it is well known that ''potentially complicating oral disease should be identified and corrected as early as possible before commencement of anticancer therapy'' (13). A comprehensive dental examination performed prior to treatment can identify approximately 80% of the patients with chronic odontogenic pathology who should receive treatment to prevent local exacerbation or systemic spread of ongoing infection while avoiding long-term oral complications, such as tooth loss (14).",

            "text": "On the other hand, the association between CPD and cardiac morbidity is well established. Cardiac complications have a serious impact on the life expectancy and quality of life of breast cancer survivors. The risk for cardiac disease may be increased in breast cancer survivors due to various reasons other than CPD. Data from The Late Effects Breast Cancer Cohort have revealed that 62.9 excess cases of cardiovascular events per 10,000 patient-years are asso-  ciated with long-term breast cancer treatment and the main risk factors are associated with radiotherapy of the internal mammary chain, radiation with adjuvant chemotherapy and smoking (15). After breast conservation treatment for early stage disease, the subsequent development of cardiac disease is more frequent in women with cancer of the left breast (16). Anthracyclines, which are largely used in breast cancer chemotherapy, have long been recognized as a cause of cardiac dysfunctions, such as cardiomyopathy and heart failure. These side effects are dose-dependent (17) and occur more frequently in older patients (18). Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the HER-2 receptor and improves the survival of women with HER-2-positive breast cancer, is also associated with an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction (19). High-quality management of breast cancer patients should include strategies for identifying patients who are at high risk for cardiac disease and developing effective interventions to prevent the development of late toxicities and minimize their effects on quality of life (20). Epidemiological (7) and experimental (5,21) evidence indicates that periodontal disease is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Despite the limitations of our case-control design and a lack of diversity in the therapeutic methods employed, our data consistently revealed a high prevalence of periodontal disease and tooth loss after breast cancer treatment in post-menopausal women. We believe that the current evidence warrants the inclusion of a recommendation for a comprehensive oral examination and treatment of identified lesions in the breast cancer management protocols in the public health system. Efforts have been made to screen for and reduce or eliminate risk factors for cardiac disease, such as smoking, elevated lipid levels and hypertension, in patients who have breast cancer after menopause. However, these efforts should also include the prevention and treatment of oral diseases.",
