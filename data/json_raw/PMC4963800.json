            "text": "The feasibility of magnetic resonance venography (MRV) for measuring change in thrombus volume with a novel anticoagulation regimen versus standard anticoagulation in patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has not been assessed. Our aim was to study the feasibility of MRV to measure change in thrombus volume in patients with acute symptomatic objectively confirmed proximal DVT in an open-label multicenter trial (edoxaban Thrombus Reduction Imaging Study, eTRIS). We randomized patients in a 2:1 allocation ratio to edoxaban 90 mg/day for 10 days followed by 60 mg/day versus parenteral anticoagulation bridging to warfarin for 3 months. The primary efficacy outcome was a surrogate end point of the relative change in MRV-quantified thrombus volume from baseline to Day 14-21. A total of 85 eligible patients from 26 study sites were randomized to edoxaban monotherapy (n=56) versus parenteral anticoagulation as a 'bridge' to warfarin (n=29). The mean relative change in MRV-quantified thrombus volume from baseline to Day 14-21 was similar in patients treated with edoxaban and parenteral anticoagulation as a 'bridge' to warfarin (\u221250.1% vs \u221258.9%; 95% confidence interval of treatment difference, \u221212.7%, 30.2%). However, thrombus extension was observed in eight patients in the edoxaban monotherapy group and in none in the warfarin group. Rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism (3.6% vs 3.6%, p=0.45) and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (5.4% vs 7.1%, p=0.34) were also similar. No major bleeds occurred in either on-treatment group during the study period. In conclusion, MRV can assess change in thrombus volume in patients with acute DVT randomized to two different anticoagulant regimens.",

MRV with direct thrombus imaging has the additional advantages of more precise differentiation of acute versus chronic DVT 6 and more accurate detection of changes in thrombus volume over time. 7 In acute DVT trials comparing anticoagulation regimens, the extent of thrombus volume reduction over time has not been evaluated using MRV.",

Overall thrombus volume regression was similar in both groups. However, a subset of patients in the edoxaban monotherapy group (16.7%) experienced an increase in thrombus volume on follow-up MRV. This observation suggests that initial parenteral anticoagulation may be important for treatment with edoxaban. In the HOKUSAI-VTE trial, parenteral anticoagulation followed by oral edoxaban 12 was shown to have a Improvement in thrombus volume and thrombotic burden is based on number of subjects with MRV assessment at baseline and Day 14-21; n = 48 for the edoxaban monotherapy group and n = 24 for the parenteral anticoagulant 'bridge' to warfarin group. b Improved thrombotic burden = any improvement in thrombus volume as measured by MRV and no adjudicated recurrent VTE (deep vein thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, or VTE-related death). Based on number of subjects with MRV assessment at baseline and Day 14-21, n = 48 for the edoxaban monotherapy group and n = 24 for the parenteral anticoagulant 'bridge' to warfarin group. c Based on number of subjects with MRV assessment at baseline and Day 14-21, n = 48 for the edoxaban monotherapy group and n = 24 for the parenteral anticoagulant 'bridge' to warfarin group. MRV is a reproducible and quantitative tool for assessment of changes in lower extremity venous thrombus volume. 7 We believe this is the first study to evaluate change in thrombus volume with MRV in this patient population. Compared with venous ultrasound, MRV provides a more comprehensive and contiguous assessment of the presence of thrombus as well as volumetric analysis. Unlike conventional venography, MRV is non-invasive. Compared with CT venography, MRV avoids ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast. Thus, MRV shows promise as a research tool. Advanced non-contrast and non-gadolinium-based MRI techniques hold promise as research tools for thrombus imaging and clinical diagnosis of DVT. 13,14 ",
