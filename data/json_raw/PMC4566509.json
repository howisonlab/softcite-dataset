The present study investigated the prevalence of giardiosis in 202 sheltered dogs using PCR. The infection rate was 33.2% (67/202); Gyeongsangbuk-do and Daejeon showed 25.7% (39/152, P < 0.0001) and 56% (28/50), respectively. The prevalence of infected female dogs (46.7%, P < 0.001) was higher than in male dogs (21.8%). A higher prevalence (43.5%, P < 0.0001) was observed in mixed breed dogs than purebred (14.1%). Although most of the fecal samples collected were from dogs of \u2265 1 year of age which showed only 27.4% positive rate, 61.8% (P < 0.001) of the total samples collected from young animals (< 1 year of age) were positive for G. intestinalis. A significantly higher prevalence in symptomatic dogs (60.8%, P < 0.0001) was observed than in asymptomatic dogs (23.8%). Furthermore, the analysis of nucleotide sequences of the samples revealed that G. intestinalis Assemblages A and C were found in the feces of dogs from Gyeongsangbuk-do and Daejeon. Since G. intestinalis Assemblage A has been known to infect humans, our results suggest that dogs can act as an important reservoir of giardiosis in Korea. Hence, hygienic management should be given to prevent possible transmission to humans.",

It is an aerotolerant enteric protozoan parasite which can cause giardiosis, infecting a wide range of vertebrate hosts including humans characterized by diarrhea, bloating, abdominal cramps, weight loss, and malabsorption [4,5]. It is one of the most common enteric parasites of companion animals and livestock, and has been observed as one of the most frequently observed parasites infecting domestic dogs [2,6]. A recent study reported that during the period of 2004-2010, 70 out of 199 published protozoal disease outbreaks were caused by Giardia [7].",

Molecular diagnostic tools are thought to provide higher sensitivity and specificity compared to either microscopic or immunological assays and have been used recently in characterizing the epidemiology of human giardiosis, and in assessing the taxonomy, zoonotic potential, and transmission of giardiosis in humans and animals [2,5,11]. PCR assay is a sensitive and specific method for detecting microorganisms by amplifying the target nucleic acids, and molecular detection methods based on this assay have been shown to be highly rapid, sensitive, and specific for detection of G. intesti-nalis cysts [12].

            "text": "In a study done by Huber et al. [18], neither gender nor age in clinically healthy dogs has a correlation with Giardia positive rate although a slightly higher prevalence in male dogs but not significant was reported by Liu et al. [19]. In contrast, the present study showed a significantly higher prevalence in female dogs (46.7%) than in male dogs (21.8%), which is in agreement with those reported by Pallant et al. [20]. Most of the samples tested were obtained from dogs of \u2265 1 year of age (83.2%) but only 27.4% were infected with Giardia as compared to the population of younger animals which showed a significant positive rate of 61.8%. This result was similar to those reported by Jacobs et al. [21] where fecal samples from dogs under 1 year of age comprised approximately 73% of Giardia cases. Mochizuki et al. [22] reported that the rate of Giardia-infected dogs was almost equal in fecal samples obtained from symptomatic or asymptomatic dogs. However, the results in our study showed that the prevalence of dogs with diarrhea was significantly higher than those without diarrhea which was similar to those reported by Liu et al. [19].",

The prevalence of G. intestinalis infection was observed to be higher in females, mixed-breed, < 1 year of age, and symptomatic dogs. Therefore, the role of dogs as a potential source of human giardiasis, though can be considered as minor, could not be excluded, and increasing awareness of this possible transmission to patients or clients is important. Further investigation is recommended to confirm the zoonotic potential of G. intestinalis detected in fecal samples from dogs in Korea.",
