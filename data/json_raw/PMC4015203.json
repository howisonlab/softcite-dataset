            "text": "Background/Aims Hypnotherapy is considered as a promising intervention for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but the evidence is still limited. The aims of this study were to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the efficacy of hypnotherapy for the treatment of IBS. Methods A literature search was performed using MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL database). Only randomized controlled trials that compared hypnotherapy with any other conventional treatment or no treatment in patients with IBS were included. Studies had to report outcomes as IBS symptom score or quality of life. The mean change in outcome score was used to pool these outcomes for the meta-analysis. Data were synthesized using the standardized mean difference for continuous data. Results Seven randomized controlled trials (6 papers) involving 374 patients with IBS were identified. Performance bias was high in all trials because it was impossible to blind participants and therapists in this type of intervention. The outcomes in this meta-analysis were evaluated at 3 months for short-term effects and at 1 year for long-term effects. The change in abdominal pain score at 3 months was significant in the hypnotherapy group (standardized mean difference,-0.83; 95% CI,-1.65 to-0.01). Three of the 4 trials showed greater improvement in overall gastrointestinal symptoms in the hypnotherapy group. Conclusions This study provides clearer evidence that hypnotherapy has beneficial short-term effects in improving gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with IBS.",

            "text": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel movements. 1 IBS can be diagnosed only when there is no objective evidence of an underlying organic disorder. 2 It is one of the most common bowel disorders diagnosed by gastroenterologists. 3 The impact of IBS on quality of life (QOL) is as strong as that observed in other serious disorders such as congestive heart failure or chronic renal failure. 4,5 Treatment options include reassurance, dietary modification, and pharmacological treatment. Current pharmacological treatments such as bulking agents, antispasmodics, and antidepressants focus mainly on controlling the symptoms of IBS. However, both pharmacological and conventional options are unsatisfactory in general. [6][7][8] Many IBS patients have psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression, 9 which provide a fundamental rationale for psychological treatment. A number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of psychological treatment for IBS. 10 Among them, hypnotherapy has gained popularity after the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 1984 demonstrating notable benefits of hypnotherapy. 11 Several additional studies have also reported benefits of hypnotherapy in treating gastrointestinal symptoms and QOL of IBS patients.",

From these conclusions, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines noted that hypnotherapy is a promising intervention for IBS but the evidence remains to be limited. 19 These uncertainties justify a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether hypnotherapy has significant beneficial effects in the treatment of IBS. Well-designed RCTs have been conducted, but there is no ongoing RCT; this prompted us to update the previous review.

One trial presented the standard deviation of the changes in their report. 20 From these data, we calculated the correlation coefficient by using the following formula. We also used the following formula to calculate the SD of the change by using the correlation coefficient in the studies that did not report this value. To combine the different scales, we used the standardized mean difference (SMD) rather than the actual means because the SMD does not depend on the measurement scale. To evaluate the magnitude of the effect size calculated by SMD, Cohen's categories were used with 0.0-0.2 = not a substantial effect size, \uff1e 0.2-0.5 = a small effect size, \uff1e 0.5-0.8 = a medium effect size, and \uff1e 0.8 = a large effect size.",

Gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) was applied to the patients as an intervention in all 7 trials. The frequency of this intervention varied from 5 to 12 sessions, and the duration of each session varied from 30 to 60 minutes. Three of the included trials used the Manchester protocol for GDH. 20,24,28 Moser et al delivered GDH in group sessions. 24 Four trials performed GDH with usual medical therapy or supportive talks and medical treatment. 20,23,24 Various methods were used for the control groups. Four trials monitored symptoms only in the control group, [20][21][22][23] and others provided supportive and medical therapy.",

The calculation of a summary measure of effect had been difficult because of heterogeneity in the outcome measures in the previous reviews. Likert scales of different grades were used to obtain scores for abdominal pain and symptoms of defecatory dysfunction in individual trials. In this meta-analysis, we used the SMD as a summary statistic for studies that assessed the same outcome but measured it with different methods. In this meta-analysis, the potential benefits of hypnotherapy in treating constipation and diarrhea were not verified because of insufficient power and internal validity. In addition, patient-reported ratings of changes in bowel habits were not able to delineate adequately whether any benefits were achieved in all of the important subconcepts (i.e., urgency, stool consistency and stool frequency). Further trials should include a predefined definition and grade for bowel habits such as the British stool scale to evaluate benefits precisely.",

The mechanism through which hypnotherapy improves abdominal pain in IBS patients is not well understood. Hypnotic reduction of somatic pain is thought to reduce the activation of certain areas of the brain, which appears to be exaggerated in IBS. 32 It is also assumed that hypnotherapy normalizes visceral sensation, decreases colonic phasic contractions, and reverses negative thoughts of IBS patients about their condition.",
