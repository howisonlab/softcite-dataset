A population-based observational study was conducted to evaluate the treatment patterns and economic burden of prescription drug treatment of HZ and PHN pain in the province of Manitoba (Canada) over a period of 15 years. Methods: Administrative health care data, including medical and hospital separation records, were examined to identify episodes of HZ using International Classification of Diseases-9/10 codes between April 1, 1997 and March 31, 2014. Episodes of PHN were identified using medical and prescription claims. Incident use of analgesic, antidepressant, or anticonvulsant drugs was used to determine prescription pain costs.",

            "text": "Herpes zoster (HZ) is an infectious disease caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster infection. This common viral disease afflicts between 20% and 30% of the population at some point in their lifetime; up to 50% of individuals over 80 years of age are affected. 1,2 The dermatological symptoms of HZ are typically preceded by prodromal symptoms that range from a tingling or burning sensation to a sharp stabbing pain. This is followed by a raised, reddish rash and vesicular lesions, typically over the region of skin affected by prodromal symptoms, 2 to 3 days later. This rash typically affects singular dermatomes resulting in a unilateral, stripe-like appearance that is diagnostic of HZ. Lesions continue to erupt for several days before the rash crusts over, generally within 7 to 10 days. Symptoms then begin to subside and total resolution generally occurs within 3 to 4 weeks. 3 While HZ is generally self-limiting, longer lasting complications can occur.",

            "text": "The most common complication of zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN is defined as pain that persists after the resolution of the dermatological symptoms of HZ. It is caused by damage to sensory neurons sustained during the initial active infection with pain persisting even after the virus has returned to its dormant state. 4 There is no single standard definition of PHN. Pain persisting at 30 to 120 days measured from onset of HZ or from healing of rash is used in the literature. [5][6][7] Pain persisting at 90 days from initial HZ diagnosis is the most commonly used definition. [5][6][7] The incidence of HZ is estimated at 3.5 to 7 cases per 1,000 person-years (PY), with the incidence in females slightly higher than in males. 8,9 The incidence of HZ increases steadily with age, rising to 6-7/1,000 PY by 60 years, and continuing to increase thereafter. 2,10,11 The rate of conversion to PHN has been estimated at anywhere from 5% to 60% of HZ cases. 7,11,12 This wide range is partially explained by the lack of standard diagnostic criteria. Studies that used pain persisting at 90 days to define PHN have a more conservative conversion rate with a narrower range of between 5% and 15%. [7][8][9][11][12][13] PHN is a challenging condition to treat, and the effectiveness of pharmacological therapy is limited. The Canadian Pain Society consensus statement on the treatment of neuropathic pain recommends as first-line therapy for PHN one of the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gabapentin, or pregabalin. 14 Opioids and topical lidocaine are listed as second-line alternatives. The European Federation of Neurological Societies 2010 treatment guidelines for neuropathic pain largely echo these recommendations. Opioids, while effective, are not recommended as first-line therapy due to side effects, development of tolerance, and risk of dependency. 15 A variety of other drugs are also discussed in the literature, including those used for other forms of neuropathy, although their efficacy for PHN is disputed. These include valproic acid/ divalproex sodium, duloxetine, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, tramadol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 6,[14][15][16][17][18] While treatment of PHN remains difficult, it is possible to reduce the risk of HZ, and with it PHN, with the HZ vaccine (Zostavax II \u00ae , Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA). This vaccine has been shown to reduce the relative risk of HZ by 51% and of PHN by almost 67%. Vaccines may decrease the chance of developing HZ, but HZ and the associated PHN are expected to continue to result in a significant burden to society in the near future.",

The use of ICD diagnostic codes to diagnose zoster was both highly selective (positive predictive value 93%) and sensitive (97.5%). 20 Multiple episodes per individual were allowed if 2 years had elapsed between episodes. To ensure only incident episodes were included in the analysis, a 2-year washout period was used; thus, any episodes identified prior to 1997/98 were excluded. Episodes where individuals were under 20 years at diagnosis were excluded to avoid misclassification of varicella zoster cases as HZ. Cases of PHN were identified by HZ pain drug treatment or medical claims with HZ ICD codes appearing past 90 days from diagnosis. Ongoing treatment is defined in the following section.",

There is limited evidence demonstrating superior efficacy and involves much greater cost compared to the other first-line therapies such as TCAs. 22 In fact, one systematic review estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) for a 50% reduction of pain for gabapentin to be 4.39 (95% CI 3.34, 6.07), while that for TCAs was 2.64 (95% CI 2.1, 3.54). 23 Gabapentin was introduced to the Canadian market in December 1994 when it was approved for the adjunctive treatment of partial seizures. 24 It was aggressively marketed to physicians for a number of nonapproved indications, including PHN, by Parke Davis. This promotion eventually led to a US federal lawsuit against the company for off-label marketing in 1996. 25 It was not until 2004 that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved gabapentin for PHN, 25 although it has never received this indication in Canada. Some of this promo- tion suggested that TCA use for PHN was inappropriate in older patients from a safety perspective. 22 However, gabapentin is not without its own adverse effects, and a systematic review suggests the number needed to harm (NNH) for major harms is actually similar for gabapentin (NNH=12.25, 95% CI 7.69, 30.2) and TCAs (NNH=16.9, 95% CI 8.85, 178). 23 Concerns have been raised about the use of opioids in noncancer pain. 26 These include the risk of dependency, the development of tolerance, and the potential for abuse, and are part of the rationale for listing opioids as second-line PHN treatment options. 15,27 However, opioids were used frequently to treat HZ-PHN episodes (Figure 2). While the high rate of use may be concerning, the median of duration of opioid treatment (Figure 3) reveals generally short-term use, possibly reflecting appropriate opioid stewardship.",

            "text": "This study has a number of strengths and limitations. Population level data from a universal single-payer health care system ensures virtually all contacts of residents with this health care system, and all prescription dispensations are captured in the study. These data sets also allow us to directly measure health system costs rather than inferring results from survey data or sampling, as it has been done in many previous studies. 12,[28][29][30] There are also several limitations to this study. We were unable to measure the true incidence of HZ in the population as only persons who sought medical treatment appeared in the administrative data. However, previous studies have reported that up to 95%-99% of persons with HZ will seek medical attention. 8,28 Second, HZ diagnostic codes or prescription treatment past 90 days postdiagnosis were used as a proxy for a PHN diagnosis as we only had access to the first three digits of ICD codes in our data. Thus, rates reported are of HZ cases requiring ongoing medical management, sometimes referred to as clinically significant PHN. This methodology is common in administrative data studies looking at PHN. 8 Finally, the use of nonprescription medications, including low-dose ibuprofen and naproxen, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, and topical treatments, is not captured. However, these costs are outside the scope of this study.",

The first is the increasing number of HZ cases. While some of this can be attributed to an aging population, the agestandardized incidence of HZ has increased. The second component is the increasing average cost of treating an episode of HZ-PHN driven by the use of higher cost anticonvulsants for longer periods of time. Management of the economic burden of HZ-PHN analgesic treatment should include the use of evidence-based cost-effective therapies and measures such as vaccination that can help reduce the incidence of HZ.",
