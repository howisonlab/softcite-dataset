We have determined the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TyrRS (SceTyrRS) complexed with a Tyr-AMP analog and the native tRNA Tyr (G)A). Structural information for TyrRS-tRNA Tyr complexes is now full-line for three kingdoms. Because the archaeal/eukaryotic TyrRSs-tRNA Tyr s pairs do not cross-react with their bacterial counterparts, the recognition modes of the identity determinants by the archaeal/eukaryotic TyrRSs were expected to be similar to each other but different from that by the bacterial TyrRSs. Interestingly, however, the tRNA Tyr recognition modes of SceTyrRS have both similarities and differences compared with those in the archaeal TyrRS: the recognition of the C1-G72 base pair by SceTyrRS is similar to that by the archaeal TyrRS, whereas the recognition of the A73 by SceTyrRS is different from that by the archaeal TyrRS but similar to that by the bacterial TyrRS. Thus, the lack of cross-reactivity between archaeal/ eukaryotic and bacterial TyrRS-tRNA Tyr pairs most probably lies in the different sequence of the last base pair of the acceptor stem (C1-G72 vs G1-C72) of tRNA Tyr. On the other hand, the recognition mode of Tyr-AMP is conserved among the TyrRSs from the three kingdoms."

            "text": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) play a central role in the assembly of amino acids into polypeptide chains. They catalyze the specific esterification of a given amino acid to its corresponding tRNA through a two-step reaction (1). In the first step, the specific amino acid and ATP substrates are recognized and then are converted into a reactive aminoacyl-adenylate (aa-AMP) intermediate in the presence of magnesium ions. In the next step, the amino acid moiety from the aa-AMP is transferred to the 3 0 -CCA terminus of the cognate tRNA. This enzymatic function is crucial for the fidelity of protein synthesis, in which the genetic code is translated to the amino acid sequence. The primary sequence analyses as well as the tertiary structure determinations allowed the partition of the 20 aaRSs into two exclusive classes, I and II, each consisting of 10 enzymes (2). Each class I enzyme has a Rossmann-fold domain as the catalytic domain. In addition, two consensus motifs, HIGH and KMSKS, are conserved among the class I enzymes. The class I enzymes are further divided into three sub-classes: Ia, Ib and Ic (3,4). The class Ic enzymes are aaRSs for tyrosine and tryptophan and are unusual in that they act as dimers, while the other class I (Ia and Ib) enzymes act as monomers.",

            "text": "Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) is the first aaRS to have its crystal structure solved (5). The specific aminoacylation of tRNA by TysRS relies on the identity determinants (the anticodon bases, the C1-G72 base pair, and the discriminator base A73) in the cognate tRNA Tyr  (6)(7)(8). To date, a number of crystal structures of the TyrRSs have been solved: they are from four bacteria, Bacillus stearothermophilus [BstTyrRS, (9)], Staphylococcus aureus [SauTyrRS, (10)], Thermus thermophilus [TthTyrRS, (11)] and Escherichia coli [EcoTyrRS, (12)]; from eukarya Homo sapiens [HsaTyrRS, (13)]; and from four archaea, Methanococcus jannaschii [MjaTyrRS, (14,15)], Archaeglobus fulgidus, Pyrococcus horikoshi and Aeropyrum pernix [AfuTyrRS, PhoTyrRS, and ApeTyrRS, respectively, (16)]. Because the archaeal/ eukaryotic TyrRSs-tRNA Tyr s pairs do not cross-react with their bacterial counterparts (8), the recognition modes of the identity determinants by the archaeal and eukaryotic TyrRSs were expected to be similar to each other but different from that by the bacterial TyrRSs. Such orthogonality is used for the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins with engineered pairs of TyrRSs and tRNA Tyr s (17). In such situations, structural information on archaeal, eukaryotic and bacterial TyrRSs complexed with their cognate tRNA Tyr s has long been awaited. In a half-decade, crystal structure analyses of bacterial (Thermus thermophilus) (11) and archaeal (Methanococcus jannaschii) (14) TyrRSs complexed with their cognate tRNA Tyr s have been reported. Although previous experiments showed that TyrRS could bind only one tRNA per dimer (18) in solution, the crystal structure analyses (11,14) have shown that two tRNA Tyr s are bound to each dimer in a symmetrical fashion in the crystal. A plausible explanation for this discrepancy (asymmetry in solution vs symmetry in crystal) has been described by Yaremchuk et al. (11). A structural comparison revealed the structural basis for orthogonal specificities of archaeal and bacterial TyrRSs (14). On the other hand, no structures are available for eukaryotic TyrRSs complexed with their cognate tRNA Tyr s. To understand the molecular basis for the recognition of their cognate tRNA Tyr s by eukaryotic TyrRSs, we initiated the structure analysis of TyrRS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SceTyrRS), the model organism for lower eukaryotes.",

A Tyr-AMP analog (O-(adenosine-5 0 -O-yl) N-(L-tyrosyl)phosphoramidate (Tyr-AMPN), ( Figure 1A) was prepared as described (45). We expressed and purified a C-terminally truncated SceTyrRS (hereafter simply SceTyrRS, residues 1-364), which has full TyrRS activity, for the present crystal structure analysis. SceTyrRS was expressed and purified in a way similar to the method described previously for the full-length SceTyrRS (residues 1-394) (34). Crystals of the ternary complex of SceTyrRS were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, as described elsewhere (46). Briefly, a droplet was prepared by mixing an equal volume of a protein solution containing ca. 0.2 mM SceTyrRS, 5 mM Tyr-AMPN ( Figure 1A), ca. 0.2 mM tRNA Tyr , 40 mM KCl in 20 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.5 and a reservoir solution containing 25% (v/v) polyethyleneglycol 400 (PEG400) and 100 mM CaCl 2 in 100 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.5. The crystals belong to tetragonal space group P4 1 2 1 2 with cell dimensions of a = b = 63.85 \u00c5 and c = 330.3 \u00c5 (under the cryogenic conditions described below). Assuming one SceTyrRS subunit and one tRNA Tyr molecule per asymmetric unit, we obtained a V M value of 2.55 \u00c5 3 /Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 52%. Since the crystallization conditions of SceTyrRS contained 25% (v/v) PEG400 in reservoir solutions, X-ray data collections could be performed under cryogenic conditions without further addition of a cryo-protectant. Crystals were mounted in nylon loops and flash-cooled in a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K just before data collection. Crystals of the ternary complex of full-length TyrRS were obtained in a similar condition as described above and had similar morphology and cell dimensions to those of the truncated TyrRS. However, they diffracted quite poor (ca. 10-\u00c5 resolution).",

The structures of several TyrRSs complexed with or without cognate tRNA Tyr and deposited in the Protein Data Bank, having ca. 10-20% sequence identity with SceTyrRS, were used as search models. Secondly, attempts were made to find good heavy-atom derivatives for phasing by the isomorphous replacement techniques. Since both of these attempts failed, we prepared a Se-Met substituted SceTyrRS using LeMaster medium (47) and E. coli B834(DE3) cells for phasing by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method. The MAD data collection was performed at beamline 38B1, SPring-8. XAFS measurements were carried out around the selenium K absorption edge using an Se-Met SceTyrRS crystal in a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Subsequently, four datasets were collected from a new single crystal of Se-Met SceTyrRS on and around the selenium K absorption edge at 100 K using an ADSC Quantum-4R CCD detector. All datasets were integrated using the program package DPS (48). Scaling and processing were performed using the CCP4 program suite (49). Thereafter, a high-resolution dataset was collected from a single crystal of native SceTyrRS at beamline 40B2, SPring-8 ( = 1.00 \u00c5 ) in a similar way. The data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1.",

            "text": "The overall structure of the ternary complex of SecTyrRS is shown in Figure 1C. As observed in the cases of TthTyrRS (11) and MjaTyrRS (14), SecTyrRS forms a homo dimer and two tRNA Tyr s are bound to each dimer in a symmetrical fashion. The asymmetric unit contains one SceTyrRS subunit and one tRNA Tyr molecule (one-half of a 2:2 complex). The molecular twofold axis coincides with a [1 1 0] crystallographic two-fold axis. In addition, a Tyr-AMP analog, Tyr-AMPN, is bound at the active site of SceTyrRS ( Figure 1B). A perfectly symmetrical SceTyrRS/tRNA Tyr /Tyr-AMPN complex in crystal presented here is contrary to the functional asymmetry of TyrRSs in solution (18) that the enzyme exhibit half-of-the-sites' reactivity with respect to the binding of tyrosine or Tyr-AMP and one tRNA molecule is bound per dimer of TyrRS. As for the explanations for this discrepancy, we completely agree with the notion pointed out by Yaremchuk et al. (11) that perfectly (or nearly) symmetrical structure observed in the crystal structures of TyrRSs is due to the fact that (i) there is ample time for substrate binding to both active sites in a crystallization experiment and there is quite likely preferential crystallization of a symmetrical form and (ii) in the case of tRNA binding, the same arguments hold. In addition, we postulate that considerably higher concentrations (as compared with the previous functional studies for TyrRSs in solution) of SceTyrRS The subunit of SceTyrRS consists of two domains. One of these, the catalytic domain, provides the groups necessary for converting the substrates Tyr and ATP into reactive intermediate Tyr-AMP (the first step of the aaRS reaction) and for transferring the amino acid moiety from the Tyr-AMP to the 3 0 -CCA terminus of the cognate tRNA Tyr (the second step of the aaRS reaction). The other domain is responsible for the recognition of the anticodon bases of the cognate tRNA Tyr . The two domains are unequal in size; the catalytic domain is somewhat larger and comprises 232 residues, whereas the anticodonbinding domain comprises 117 residues. The catalytic domain comprises residues 8 to 239. The structural core of this domain is an a/b structure (or Rossmann fold) comprised of a six-stranded parallel b-sheet and 10 surrounding a-helices ( Figure 1C, light colors). The Tyr-AMPN molecule is bound in the central region of the carboxyl end of the parallel b-sheet in the center of the domain. The anticodon-binding domain comprises residues 240 to 356. The basic element of the secondary structure in this domain consists of six a-helices and a two-stranded anti-parallel b-hairpin ( Figure 1C, dark colors). A loop region between the two domains (residues 224-233), including the KMSKS signature motif, which is   Figure 1C). The structural discontinuity in the anticodon-loop of tRNA Tyr is due to the disordered nucleotides C32-U33. However, the anticodon triplet of tRNA Tyr (G\u00c9A) was well ordered ( Figure 1D). The catalytic domain of one subunit (yellow) recognizes the acceptor stem of a tRNA (blue), while the anticodonbinding domain of the other subunit (green) recognizes the anticodon bases of the same tRNA (blue). The overall structure of the ternary complex of SceTyrRS is similar to that of MjaTyrRS (Figure 2A and B), which is expected from the amino acid sequence similarity (Figure 3).",

The structure of the C-terminal domain of BstTyrRS was determined using NMR (20), and was found to have a very similar structure to that of TthTyrRS (11). Recent advances in genome sequencing revealed that bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases occur in two large subfamilies; TyrRS and TyrRZ that possess about 25% amino-acid sequence identity (21 and references therein). More detailed functional and structural analyses of the TyrRZ-tRNA Tyr complex are necessary to shed more light on the evolutionary divergence of the enzyme-tRNA interactions of the TyrRS and TyrRZ subfamilies in the bacterial domain.",

The first anticodon, G34, is flipped out and base-specifically recognized by SceTyrRS ( Figure 4A). The guanine ring moiety of G34 shows a stacking interaction with Phe296. The opposite face of the base has hydrophobic contact with Pro320. The N1 and O6 atoms of G34 have basespecific interactions with Asp321 through bifurcated hydrogen bonds. It is reported that mutation of G34 in yeast tRNA Tyr impairs aminoacylation by SceTyrRS (7). The second and third anticodon bases, \u00c935 and A36, have fewer base-specific interactions with the enzyme; only N3 of \u00c935 hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl group of Cys255 ( Figure 4A). They are accommodated in a hydrophobic patch composed of Phe254, Pro257, Pro319 and Pro320 ( Figure 1D). This observation is also consistent with the results of the functional analysis of SceTyrRS by Fechter et al. (7). It is of note here that the tyrosylation activity is compatible with an 'a+1 shift' [Figure 6 (7)] of the anticodon in the 3 0 -direction (G35-U36-A37) but is strongly inhibited in the opposite 5 0 -direction (G33-U34-A35) (7). This result is explained by the present structure analysis, which shows that the electron density of the anticodon stem region was rather poor: the base moieties 31, 40 and 41 and the whole nucleotides 32 and 33 of tRNA Tyr were disordered. In addition, our recent biochemical analysis (22) also suggests the flexibility of the anticodon stem region of Sce-tRNA Tyr . This is consistent with the low G-C content at the anticodon stem region of Sce-tRNA Tyr as compared with that of Mja-tRNA Tyr . The flexibility in the 5 0 -portion of the anticodon loop enables the shift of the anticodon in the 3 0 -direction, which can be regarded as an insertion of one nucleotide before G34. The anticodon recognition mode of archaeal MjaTyrRS ( Figure 4B) is quite similar to that of eukaryotic SceTyrRS (Figure 4A), except that the hydrophobic interaction between Pro320 and G34 in SceTyrRS is replaced by the stacking interaction between His283 and G34 in MjaTyrRS.",

The recognition mode of the C1 base by the side chain of Arg193 in SceTyrRS is equivalent to that by the side chain of Arg174 in MjaTyrRS. The G72 base is recognized by a slightly different manner between SceTyrRS and MjaTyrRS. The 3 0 -terminal strand of the acceptor stem of SceTyrRS shows a helical conformation. The G72 base in SceTyrRS is recognized by a base-specific hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg151 and a stacking interaction with the discriminator base A73, which is fixed by a hydrogen bond with Arg193. On the other hand, the 3 0 -terminal strand of the acceptor stem of MjaTyrRS shows a rather extended conformation. The G72 base is far from the side chain of Arg132, corresponding to Arg151 in SceTyrRS, and is recognized by the side chain of Lys175. The side chain of Arg132 is involved in the recognition of the C1 base, rather than the G72 base, via a water-mediated hydrogen bond ( Figure 5B). Although the G72 base recognition mode of SceTyrRS and that of MjaTyrRS have some differences, the archaeal/eukaryotic TyrRSs recognize the identity base pair C1-G72 by conserved residues (Figure 3) and we assume that the recognition mode of the C1-G72 base pair by the archaeal/eukaryotic TyrRSs are essentially conserved.",

An equivalent recognition mode is observed for the TthTyrRS complex ( Figure 5C): the N3 of A73 is recognized by Arg198 via a single hydrogen bond, and the discriminator base A73 is stacked with the C72 base. In the case of MjaTyrRS (Figure 5B), the discriminator base A73 is unstacked with the G72 base and out of the helical continuity of the acceptor stem. The N1 and N6 atoms of A73 are base-specifically recognized by the main-chain amino and carbonyl groups, respectively, of Val195. Since Arg193 in SceTyrRS (Arg198 in TthTyrRS) is also conserved in MjaTyrRS (Arg174), the observation that A73 is bound in a different manner in SceTyrRS and MjaTyrRS may reflect different modes of binding, rather than species-specific difference. However, it should be noted here that the Arg residues are not conserved in BstTyrRS (Trp196) and EcoTyrRS (Trp201) (Figure 3). The different recognition pattern of A73 would be observed in BstTyrRS and EcoTyrRS.",

The Tyr-AMP recognition mode is well conserved among the archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic TyrRSs as described below. The tyrosine moiety is accommodated in a deep pocket of the enzyme ( Figure 6A). The hydroxyl group of the tyrosine moiety makes hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Tyr43 and Asp177. The main-chain amino group of the tyrosine moiety is specifically recognized by three hydrogen bonds: they are from the side chains of Tyr170, Gln174 and Gln192. The carbonyl group of the tyrosine moiety is recognized by the side chain of Gln192. In archaeal and bacterial TyrRSs ( Figure 6B and C), the recognition mode of the tyrosine moiety of Tyr-AMP is apparently similar to that of SceTyrRS. Tyr170, Gln174, Asp177 and Gln192 in SceTyrRS are well conserved ( Figure 3) and play the same roles in the binding of the tyrosine moiety of Tyr-AMP (or its analog) among TyrRSs. In the case of BstTyrRS/TyrAMP complex (9), however, the side chain of Gln195 (Gln192 in SceTyrRS) does not form a hydrogen bond with the amino group of Tyr-AMP. Instead, the side chain of Asp78 is involved in the hydrogen bond with the amino group of Tyr-AMP together with the side chains of Tyr169 and Gln173 (Tyr170 and Gln174 in SceTyrRS). As for the recognition mode of the AMP moiety of Tyr-AMPN, the adenine ring is base-specifically recognized by the main-chain atoms of Val219 in SceTyrRS [N6(Ade)-O(Val229) and N1(Ade)-N(Val229), Figure 6A]. A similar recognition mode is also found for the main chain atoms of Leu224 in TthTyrRS ( Figure 6C). The oxygen atom of the phosphate group of Tyr-AMPN is fixed to the protein surface [Ala47(O), Tyr56(OH), and Tyr101(OH)], via a magnesium ion ( Figure 6A).",

In that study, Kobayashi et al. (12) assumed that after the amino acid activation, the KMSKS motif adopts the semi-open form to accept the 3 0 -CCA terminus of tRNA for the aminoacyl transfer reaction. In the present structure of SceTyrRS, residues 224-233, including the KMSAS sequence (Figure 3), are disordered. This flexibility of the loop containing the KMSKS motif would allow the Tyr-AMP to be fully exposed and the 3 0 -CCA terminus of tRNA to access the aminoacyl transfer center. Unfortunately, however, the 3 0 -CCA terminus of tRNA Tyr is ordered but flipped out from the active center in the present crystal structure ( Figure 5D). In the case of TthTyrRS (Figure 6C), the loop containing the KMSKS motif interacts with ATP and is structurally well ordered.",

            "text": "In the aminoacylation of tRNAs, each amino acid is matched with a tRNA that contains the anticodon that corresponds to that amino acid. Although the anticodons within tRNAs are conserved for a given amino acid throughout evolution, the aaRS from one species does not aminoacylate its cognate tRNA from another species in some cases. Typical example is TyrRSs that exhibit species-specific tRNA Tyr recognition (8,(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29)(30). The origin of species-specific tRNA Tyr recognition is the presence of a G1-C72 base pair in bacterial tRNA Tyr and a C1-G72 pair in archaeal/eukaryotic tRNA Tyr  (29). Because the archaeal/eukaryotic TyrRSs-tRNA Tyr s pairs do not cross-react with their bacterial counterparts, the recognition modes of the identity determinants by the archaeal and eukaryotic TyrRSs were expected to be similar to each other but different from that by the bacterial TyrRSs. Interestingly, however, a structural comparison between the present crystal structure of the ternary complex of SceTyrRS with the available crystal structures of the ternary complexes of TthTyrRS (11) and MjaTyrRS (14) revealed (i) an unexpected similarity in the recognition mode of the discriminator base A73 between SceTyrRS and TthTyrRS ( Figure 5A and C) and (ii) some differences in the recognition mode of the G72-A73 bases between SceTyrRS and MjaTyrRS ( Figure 5A and B). These features indicate that the interaction mode between TyrRS and the cognate tRNA Tyr appears to have evolved separately for the three kingdoms of life, i.e. TyrRSs/ tRNA Tyr s pairs have diverged after the kingdoms separated (31).",

In the class I aaRSs, the amino acid binding pocket lies at the bottom of an active site cleft in the Rossmann-fold domain. In general, the class I aaRSs use a lock-and-key mechanism to recognize the side chains of their amino acid substrates, although some exceptions exist. Detailed sequence alignment of TyrRSs and TrpRSs as well as the crystal structure analyses of human TyrRS (HsaTyrRS) and human TrpRS (HsaTrpRS) by Yang et al. (32) provided a unique example for amino acid discrimination by TyrRS and TrpRS. An environment for recognition of the hydroxyl group of Tyr side chain is provided by the universal presence of aspartate (Asp173 in HsaTyrRS) and the presence of either tyrosine (Tyr39 in HsaTyrRS) or lysine (Lys41 in TthTyrRS) (Figures 3 and  6). Interestingly, TrpRS uses the structurally equivalent residues (either Pro287 or Tyr159, respectively, in HsaTrpRS, but not both) to hydrogen bond to the indole nitrogen of tryptophan. In the case of yeast system [Asp177 and Tyr43 in SceTyrRS ( Figure 6A) and Thr233 and Tyr106 in SceTrpRS(GI:51013347)], the same arguments appear to hold, although crystal structure analysis of SceTrpRS has not yet reported. The present crystal structure analysis of SceTyrRS and structural comparisons of the amino acid binding site of TyrRSs ( Figure 6) are consistent with the structural and phylogenetic studies of TyrRS and TrpRS by Yang et al.

We have been trying to utilize the yeast TyrRS/tRNA Tyr pair as a candidate for the carrier of unnatural amino acid in the E. coli translation system in vivo (39) or in vitro (40). We previously showed that the substitution of tyrosine at position 43 to glycine (Y43G mutation) in SceTyrRS led to a drastic change in amino acid specificity. The Y43G mutant was found to be able to utilize several 3-substituted L-tyrosine analogs, rather than L-tyrosine, as substrates for aminoacylation (34). Used together with yeast amber suppressor tRNA Tyr , the Y43G mutant should serve as an effective tool for site-specific incorporation of 3-substituted tyrosine analogs into proteins in an appropriate E. coli translation system (41). The present crystal structure analysis can explain the structural basis for recognition of 3-substituted tyrosine analogs by the Y43G mutant SceTyrRS. Since the side chain of Tyr43 is directly involved in binding with the tyrosine moiety of Tyr-AMPN ( Figure 6A), substitution of the tyrosine residue to a smaller residue creates a space to accommodate an extra functional group at position 3 of the substrate. Similar replacements are also reported for EcoTyrRS (17,38). The proteins containing unnatural amino acids will be used as molecular switches for signaling pathways, as photocrosslinkers, fluorescently labeled probes, or heavy-atom derivatives for phasing in X-ray structure determination.",

            "text": "It is reported that human TyrRS is secreted during apoptosis in cell culture and is cleaved with an extracellular elastase, and the two released fragments (the N-terminal 'mini-TyrRS' and the EMAP II-like C-terminal domain) are active cytokines (42). The mini-TyrRS has an ELR motif in the Rossmann-fold domain. This motif is responsible for IL-8-like cytokine activity and is conserved among segmented animals, whereas it is absent in yeast and lower eukaryote. In the case of yeast, SceTyrRS is inactive as a cytokine and has a NYR motif instead of an ELR motif. Interestingly, Liu et al. (43) reported that substitution of the tripeptide NYR to ELR in SceTyrRS resulted in mutant TyrRS with cytokine activity. This result suggests that it is the E and L that are strong candidates for a direct involvement in cytokine receptor binding. However, the Arg side chain appears to be also important for the cytokine activity of TyrRS, because an Arg93-to-Gln mutation in human mini-TyrRS abolished cytokine activity (42). A structural comparison between the ELR motif of human mini-TyrRS and the NYR motif of SceTyrRS (Figure 7) reveals that the overall structures around the motifs are similar to each other. Since the side chains of the ELR motif of human mini-TyrRS and the NYR motif of SceTyrRS are exposed, it is quite reasonable that substitution of the tripeptide NYR to ELR in SceTyrRS resulted in mutant TyrRS with cytokine activity.",
