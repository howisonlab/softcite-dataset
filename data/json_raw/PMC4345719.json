            "text": "Hyponatremia is a common and potentially serious complication of transsphenoidal surgery (TSS). Since September 2009, we have implemented moderate water intake restriction (<2500 mL/day) after TSS in an attempt to prevent this complication. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a combination of moderate restriction of water intake plus antidiuretic hormone (arginine vasopressin [AVP]) replacement therapy in patients with diabetes insipidus (DI) for reducing the incidence of delayed hyponatremia after TSS. Patients treated from September 2005 to August 2009 were allowed to drink water freely after surgery (the control group), while patients treated from September 2009 to June 2012 were restricted to less than 2500 mL water per day (the water restriction group). To reduce the occurrence of hypernatremia, AVP replacement therapy was provided immediately after the development of DI. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of hyponatremia, DI, and hypernatremia in patients following TSS. Hyponatremia incidence was significantly lower in the water restriction group (P = 0.017); however, there were no significant differences in DI incidence and hypernatremia incidence between the 2 groups. Under DI control with AVP replacement therapy, the water restriction group showed no significant difference in the daily self-rated thirst level for the patients with and without DI. Moderate water intake restriction in addition to AVP replacement therapy significantly decreases the incidence of hyponatremia without patient discomfort (extreme thirst) and other complications. However, further studies are required to determine the most effective amount of water and the optimal duration of postoperative water restriction.",

            "text": "Transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) is the first-line treatment for sellar and parasellar lesions, with the exception of some specific anatomical and histopathological conditions. Pituitary adenoma is the most common lesion treated using this approach. This surgery is less invasive and seldom results in serious complications; however, it can be the cause of disturbance in water and electro-lyte metabolism. Diabetes insipidus (DI) occurs in 10% to 50% of patients after TSS 4,6,11,12,14) , while delayed hyponatremia is reported to occur in 1.8% to 35% of patients around postoperative day 7 9, 11, 13, 16, 19) . Hyponatremia may become symptomatic, and prolonged hyponatremia may be life threatening 5,9,21) . It is imperative to minimize risk factors for delayed hyponatremia after transsphenoidal tumor resection, because recent advances in neuroendoscopic techniques are less traumatic to the nasal apparatus, resulting in shorter hospital stays. Hyponatremia following TSS may arise because of deficiency in the supply of adrenocortical hormone, syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), and/or inappropriate fluid consumption 8,13,17) . Although the causes of delayed hyponatremia following TSS are still unclear, some authors attribute this to SIADH and others suggest frequent coincidence with DI 8,15,20) . We promote a novel method for managing water and electrolyte balance after TSS. We have previously managed water balance after TSS with free fluid intake and aggressive fluid replacement. In the present study, we adopted moderate restriction of postoperative water intake and reduced fluid replacement while carefully monitoring DI and body weight. We also monitored subjective sensation of thirst, as excessive thirst may hinder treatment compliance. To this end, we created a self-rated thirst level scale and assessed the relationship between thirst and DI in relation to delayed hyponatremia after TSS. The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of moderate restriction of water intake to reduce the occurrence of delayed hyponatremia after TSS.",

We operated through a unilateral nostril (usually on the right side), using a midline paraseptal approach to access the sphenoid sinus. This approach leaves the contralateral nostril intact and results in reduced postoperative nasal obstruction and less severe postoperative thirst due to oral breathing. The ipsilateral mucosa on the nasal septum was dissected to the level of the anterior wall of the sphenoid sinus. The bony septum was removed to expose the mucosa on the contralateral side. Routine wide-open sphenoidotomy was performed for all patients. Sellar and suprasellar procedures began with internal debulking of the tumor, followed by identification of the tumor capsule. In most cases, capsulectomy with an angled endoscope was possible. After tumor excision, we packed the tumor cavity with abdominal fat to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage.

Previously identified risk factors for hyponatremia after TSS are older age, female sex, microadenomas, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing tumors, and the presence of transient DI 7,10,13,16,17,21) . Although there were no significant differences in patient demographics or tumor-type distribution between the water restriction group and the control group, moderate water restriction significantly decreased the occurrence of this potentially life-threatening complication. Although there was no significant difference in the occurrence of symptomatic hyponatremia between the 2 groups, the occurrence of symptomatic hyponatremia tended to be quite low, because only 1 patient on water restriction developed symptomatic hyponatremia (1.1%) compared with 6 control patients (6.5%). The incidence of combined DI and hyponatremia was significantly lower in the water restriction group than in the control group. Olson et al. reported that two-thirds of normonatremic patients had dysfunctional arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion under the water load test at 7 days after TSS, and that 9 of 23 patients actually developed hyponatremia after the water load test 13) . Hence, even normonatremic patients can develop hyponatremia after this surgery 13) . Thus, many patients may be susceptible to hyponatremia following TSS if exposed to excessive volitional fluid consumption. In this study, the average daily oral fluid intake was greater than 2500 mL in 83% of the combined DI and hyponatremia patients in the control group. On the other hand, patients restricted to 2500 mL/ day, especially those with DI, demonstrated a significantly reduced occurrence of hyponatremia.",

Patients occasionally drink water excessively after their urine output decreases, which can cause delayed hyponatremia after TSS in patients with DI. The reported incidence of combined DI and hyponatremia in this study is within the range of 4.5%-20% 1,3,7,11,13,16,21) . We speculate that water restriction for patients with DI under antidiuretic hormone replacement therapy stabilizes net changes in body fluid content and facilitates the control of fluid and electrolyte balance. This moderate water restriction regimen has the potential to reduce the incidence of hyponatremia after surgery.",

In this study, all patients underwent purely endoscopic endonasal TSS. The incidence of hyponatremia was 5.4% in the water restriction group and 16.3% in the control group. Recent large studies on delayed hyponatremia reported that hyponatremia occurs in 36.7% of patients treated with microscopic surgery 11) . In comparison, the incidence of hyponatremia observed in the present study was relatively low, even in the control group.

There was no significant difference between the incidence of hypernatremia in the experimental and control groups. We implemented AVP replacement therapy to control the urine output immediately after approaching DI criteria to avoid dehydration. However, 3 patients in the experimental group developed DI. To reduce the incidence of hypernatremia among patients, water restriction therapy should be aborted until DI is brought under control. In our opinion, DI control is important for reducing not only the incidence of hypernatremia, but also the thirst level, which in turn reduces oral fluid intake. Some researchers have reported that ADH replacement therapy during the first 2 postoperative weeks can actually increase the risk for hyponatremia, and thus, close monitoring of patient body weight and urine output is recommended, especially for patients undergoing ADH replacement therapy 7,11,12) . ADH replacement therapy can be safe and can even decrease the incidence of hyponatremia if implemented together with water restriction therapy and can be withdrawn when the patient's body weight increases or when the patient's urine parameters no longer meet the criteria for DI.",

Nasal packing was not employed after surgery if cerebrospinal fluid leakage was not predicted in the intraoperative period. This provided patients a natural nasal airway via their intact left nostril.

Indeed, hyponatremia after TSS is a largely preventable complication. Patients should not drink water freely after TSS, even if they are normonatremic and develop DI.
