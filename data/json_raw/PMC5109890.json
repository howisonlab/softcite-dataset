It was reported that use of the PCPT risk calculator can avoid 1% and 2% of unnecessary biopsies if a threshold probability of 20% and 30% is used for patients with PSA from 0.5 to 50 ng ml \u22121 , respectively. ERSPC risk calculator included PSA, DRE, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) findings, and prostate volume (PV). It was reported that use of ERSPC risk calculator can avoid 9% and 23% of unnecessary biopsies if a threshold probability of 20% and 30% is used for patients with PSA from 0.5 to 50 ng ml \u22121 , respectively. 5 The utility of these risk calculators had been externally validated in Western populations and observed to outperform PSA and %fPSA for predicting PCa. 6-8 However, limited data on the performance of PCa risk calculators had been reported in Chinese populations. Since PCPT and ERSPC risk calculators were based on screening populations (most participants in PCPT had PSA below 6.0 ng ml \u22121 and participants in ERSPC had a mean PSA of 1.7 ng ml \u22121), 9,10 they would not be appropriate for clinical-based populations in China. In addition, a lack of information on family history (due to the inadequate healthcare policy in the past",

            "text": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of death among men worldwide. 1 The incidence of PCa in China is relatively low compared with Western countries; however, it has been progressively rising in recent decades. 2 Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most widely used biomarker for prostate cancer screening and early detection of PCa. However, its relatively low specificity has resulted in large number of unnecessary biopsies. 3 To solve this problem, several independent factors have been considered for predicting PCa, for example, age, results from digital rectal exam (DRE), and several PSA derivatives such as ratio of free to total PSA (%fPSA), PSA density (PSAD), and PSA velocity (PSAV). 4 In some studies, prediction tools (such as nomograms and risk calculators) were based on these factors, which might provide added value to PSA testing for predicting PCa or high-grade PCa. Among those prediction tools, the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) risk calculator and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculator were most widely used in Western populations. The PCPT reported a risk calculator that was built based",

First, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses in a retrospective training cohort and built the Huashan risk calculators (RC 1 and RC 2). We found that the Huashan risk calculators (especially RC 1) performed better than the PCPT risk calculator and PSA alone for predicting PCa. Second, we validated the Huashan risk calculators in a prospective, observational study. We found that RC 1 performed better than the PCPT risk calculator in the validation cohort as well. Finally, we evaluated the reduction rate of biopsy using risk calculators and found that RC 1 still had added value on avoiding unnecessary biopsies.",

A recent meta-analysis showed that the summary AUC of the PCPT risk calculator was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.62-0.70) and the AUC of the ERSPC RC 3 was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.77-0.81). In the initial screening, the PCPT risk calculator was slightly better than PSA at predicting PCa whereas ERSPC was much better. 13 In the current study, our risk calculators were based on available information without any further invasive procedures. The PCPT risk calculator included the variables of PSA, family history of prostate cancer, DRE, a prior negative prostate biopsy, race, and age. It had been previously evaluated in Western populations and a Chinese population, and it was widely recognized. The AUCs of the PCPT risk calculator in the Western populations ranged from 0.57 to 0.69, and the AUC was higher (0.78) in the Chinese population. [6][7][8]14 However, the incompleteness of epidemiologic data in China was incomplete in the past decades due to ineffective health-care policies might have weakened the utility of the PCPT risk calculator (which uses race and family history) for predicting PCa in the Chinese population. Thus, we attempted to improve the PCa risk calculator for Chinese population. For the ERSPC risk calculator 3, the variable of age was not included. While age is considered an important risk factor for PCa and has been evaluated in several studies in both Western and Chinese populations, [15][16][17][18] we included age in our risk calculators. Moreover, the characteristics of the cohorts in the current study were different from the PCPT risk calculator cohort, particularly with respect to the inclusion in the initial study cohort (all the participants in this study had indications for prostate biopsy, whereas the participants in PCPT had PSA \u22643.0 ng ml \u22121 ) and biopsy cores (most of the participants in this study underwent the 10-core biopsy whereas 80% of the participants in PCPT underwent the 6-core biopsy). Since there is no PSA screening in the Chinese population due to the large population and social burden, we decided that the PCa risk calculator should be tailored more to a biopsy population than to a screening population.",

However, there were several limitations in our study. First, the study population was from a single tertiary health institute which could lead to selection bias. Nevertheless, as we mentioned above, tertiary health institutes in China, receive patients from all over the country. Therefore, our study population could be partially representative of the Chinese population. Second, the study population was at relatively high risk for PCa as we noted above, and thus the risk calculator might be more applicable to other biopsy populations rather than to screening populations. Third, the use of a different definition of high-grade PCa in the Chinese guidelines might restrict the application of the risk calculators for predicting high-grade PCa in other populations. Fourth, the performance of ERSPC RC 3 was not tested in the current study for lack of formulae. Since ERSPC risk calculator is also a logistic regression based risk calculator and is known to perform better than PCPT risk calculator, it might perform equivalent to the Huashan risk calculators. Although the Huashan risk calculators were more tailored to a Chinese biopsy population with relatively high risk, it still required further refinement and validation.",
