            "text": "Background: Prostate artery embolization (PAE) is emerging and is a promising minimally invasive therapy that improves lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The purpose of this article was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PAE on LUTS related to BPH. Materials and methods: A literature review was performed to identify all published articles of PAE for BPH. The sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library from 1980 to 2016. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. The outcome measurements were combined by calculating the mean difference with 95% confidence interval. Statistical analysis was carried out using Review Manager 5.3.0. Results: Twelve studies involving 840 participants were included. Compared with baseline, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5; International Prostate Symptom Score) scores, the quality of life scores, peak urinary flow rate (Q max) and postvoid residual volume all had significant improvements during the 24-month follow-up (all P,0.00001). Both prostate volume (PV) and prostate-specific antigen had significant decrease during the 12-month follow-up (P,0.00001 and P=0.005, respectively), except postoperative 24 months (P=0.47 and P=0.32, respectively). The IIEF-5 short form scores had significant increase at postoperative 6 months (P=0.002) and 12 months (P,0.0001), except postoperative 1 month (P=0.23) and 24 months (P=0.21). For large volume (PV $80 mL) BPH, the results were similar. There were no life-threatening complications. Conclusion: PAE is an effective, safe and well-tolerable treatment for LUTS related to BPH, including large volume (PV $80 mL) BPH, with a good short-term follow-up. Studies with large number of cases and longer follow-up time are needed to validate our results.",

            "text": "The current treatment options include watchful waiting, medical therapy and surgical intervention. The patients refractory to preliminary treatments can be treated with surgical intervention. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the gold standard therapy for LUTS/BPH and, for many years, has been considered the surgical treatment of choice and the standard of care when other treatment methods fail. 2 However, TURP has significant complications, including short-term bleeding, dilutional hyponatremia, sexual dysfunction and incontinence. The complication rate is higher for patients with large volume BPH. 3 Recently, prostate artery embolization (PAE) has started emerging and is a promising minimally invasive therapy that improves LUTS related to BPH and is associated with a decrease in prostate volume (PV). 4 However, it is reported that as many as 25% of patients show no significant improvement in symptoms and peak flow rate. In addition, the average reduction rate in the PV after PAE was only 20%. 5 The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PAE on LUTS related to BPH, which may help urologists make better choices in the case of elderly patients with large volume BPH.",

It implied that PAE could take effect quickly. Furthermore, the IPSSs (\u221215.62 points), QoL scores (\u22122.15 points), Q max (+5.89 mL/s) and PVR volume (\u221249.07 mL) still had significant improvements during the 24-month follow-up, suggesting that PAE had good control of symptoms within 2 years.",

We thought that the effect of PAE cannot be maintained in the long-term period. Besides prostate size increasing with age, revascularization of the prostatic arteries after PAE may play a role in prostate regrowth. Pisco et al 13 observed this kind of revascularization in their patients with second PAE. Interestingly, the IPSSs still had a significant decrease despite prostatic enlargement at postoperative 24 months. This may suggest that physical reduction of the obstructing tissue was not the only reason for the improvement in LUTS after PAE. In terms of the IIEF-5 scores, there was no significant increase until 6 months after PAE. The epidemiological evidence had suggested a clear and clinically meaningful association between LUTS and sexual dysfunction that was independent of age and comorbidity. 17 Along with the continuous improvement in LUTS, the IIEF-5 scores started to increase.",

They have increased operative risk of undergoing TURP/open surgery or refuse any surgical treatment. 18 In this meta-analysis, for large volume (PV $80 mL) BPH, there were significant improvements in the IPSSs (\u221218.32 points), QoL scores (\u22122.50 points), PV (\u221247.58 mL), Q max (+6.00 mL/s) and PVR volume (\u221276.80 mL) after PAE during the 12-month follow-up, and there were no lifethreatening complications. PAE does offer the ability to treat BPH in these patients, due to its minimally invasive nature with low morbidity and the possibility to use local anesthetic without sedation. 8 Subsequent studies have further compared the clinical outcome of PAE versus TURP. Carnevale et al 19 reported that both groups experienced significant improvement in IPSS, QoL, PV, and Q max during the 12-month follow-up. TURP resulted in significantly higher Q max and smaller PV than PAE but required spinal anesthesia and hospitalization, while IIEF scores were significantly higher in the PAE group. Gao et al 20 reported a similar result during the 24-month follow-up, except that the PAE group showed more complications, mostly related to AUR (25.9%), postembolization syndrome (11.1%) and treatment failures (5.3% technical; 9.4% clinical).",
