Underweight may be associated with malnutrition and comorbidities. In a large Danish study it was found (after hip replacement and knee replacement) be a risk factor for postoperative ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death-with higher mortality than in patients with normal BMI (Thornqvist et al. 2014). Also, underweight has been associated with re-admission after THA or TKA in general, and specifi cally for infection and hip dislocation (Alfonso et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2012.",

Thus, the risk profi le appears to be increased with THA or TKA in overweight or obese patients, and even in previously obese patients. As some overweight/obese patients still need arthroplasty operations and because high BMI may only (to some extent) compromise the clinical outcome (Foster et al. 2015) or implant survival (Tai et al. 2014), it is important to assess the risks in different weight classes. As fast-track THA and TKA may offer the best available treatment, combining evidence-based clinical features with organizational optimization and reduced morbidity and mortality (Husted 2012, Husted et al. 2014, J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2013, we determined perioperative morbidity and mortality levels in patients with BMIs outside the normal range who were operated with the fast-track methodology, and compared these levels to those in patients with normal BMI.",

It also results in favorable safety profi les regarding LOS, morbidity, and readmissions in particular high-risk patients (Husted et al. 2015, J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2013. The distribution of BMI in this large multicenter cohort of unselected patients operated with the fast-track methodology showed that one-third of hip arthroplasty patients and only one-fi fth of knee arthroplasty patients had a normal BMI with the latter being heavier. We found that the median LOS was 2 days in all BMI groups, but the proportion of patients who stayed more than 4 days was signifi cantly higher in the very obese THA patients-whereas being a little overweight appeared to be protective, as this group of patients generally had a shorter LOS. The same trend was seen in TKA patients, as the proportion of patients in the overweight and obese groups who stayed more than 4 days was less than in the normal-BMI group. A possible explanation for this fi nding would be higher muscle volume in the slightly to moderately overweight patients, facilitating earlier fulfi llment of the strictly functional discharge criteria (Husted 2012)-whereas the very obese patients might be limited in this by having too much body weight, as one study found postoperative improvements in quadriceps function following TKA to be slower in patients with higher BMIs (Pua et al. 2015) and a similar underlying mechanism could explain the same fi nding in THA. As strictly functional discharge criteria were used, and reduced muscle strength has been identifi ed as being 1 of 3 main reasons for delayed discharge (the other 2 being pain and dizziness), the slower regaining of quadriceps strength may result in delayed functional recovery and therefore in a longer time to discharge (Husted et al. 2011).",

Also, BMI did not affect 90-day re-admission rates, although there was near-statistical signifi cance in overweight and obese TKA patients, whereas the groups of very obese and morbidly obese patients did not have more re-admissions than the other BMI groups. This contrasts with most of the published studies, where more conventional pathways were followed without strict adherence to fast-track principles with optimization of both evidence-based clinical features and logistics (see Material and methods). A meta-analysis on the potential infl uence of a BMI of greater than 30 on outcome after TKA has found substantially higher complication rates in obese and morbidly obese patients than in non-obese patients (15% and 22% as compared to 9%) (McElroy et al. 2013). Also, a cohort study on the clinical outcome of TKA patients (comparing those with a BMI of between 30 and 40 with those with a BMI of less than 30) found higher complication rates in the former group (11% vs. 4%), but without any significant difference in LOS (Issa et al. 2013). Also, in obese THA patients, smaller improvements in outcome scores and more wound complications have been found. In patients who were more obese, even reduced outcomes in function and quality of life, more wound complications, more re-admissions, and more reoperations were found (Jameson et al. 2014). A recent meta-analysis on the infl uence of obesity on the outcome of THA also found that obese patients have more complications in general and more dislocations and deep infections in particular-while having longer operations, similar LOS, and reduced functional outcome than non-obese patients (Liu et al. 2015). These fi ndings in patients who are operated in more conventional settings contrast with our fi ndings from a fasttrack setting, where no difference in specifi c complications was found between different BMI groups.",

First of all, no PROMs or objective data on function are reported, as we concentrated solely on LOS and complications necessitating re-admission. However, in Demark the unique registries ensure complete follow-up, and the basis of achieving a good functional result is to avoid severe complications that result in re-admission. Secondly, the numbers were small regarding underweight patients (77 THA patients (1.1%) and 29 TKA patients (0.4%)) and morbidly obese patients (85 THA patients (1.2%) and 289 TKA patients (4.4%)), making the statistical conclusions less robust and increasing the width of the confi dence intervals. Nonetheless, we did have enough patients and events to justify adjustment for multiple variables previously found to infl uence outcome after fast-track THA and TKA. In conclusion, higher BMI (very obese patients and morbidly obese patients only) in THA is associated with a slightly higher risk of having a LOS of more than 4 days, but not with re-admissions, whereas no such relationship existed for TKA. The fast-track methodology therefore protects against the higher morbidity found with higher BMI in more conventional settings. Furthermore, BMI should not be a limiting factor for THA or TKA, and surgery in a fast-track setting is a safe way to reduce the risk of complications and re-admission, irrespective of BMI.
