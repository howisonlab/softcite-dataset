            "text": "Fusion of mononucleated myoblasts to form multinucleated myofibers is an essential phase of skeletal myogenesis, which occurs during muscle development as well as during postnatal life for muscle growth, turnover, and regeneration. Many cell adhesion proteins, including integrins, have been shown to be important for myoblast fusion in vertebrates, and recently focal adhesion kinase (FAK), has been proposed as a key mediator of myoblast fusion. Here we focused on the possible role of PKC\u03b8, the PKC isoform predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, in myoblast fusion. We found that the expression of PKC\u03b8 is strongly up-regulated following freeze injury-induced muscle regeneration, as well as during in vitro differentiation of satellite cells (SCs; the muscle stem cells). Using both PKC\u03b8 knockout and muscle-specific PKC\u03b8 dominant-negative mutant mouse models, we observed delayed body and muscle fiber growth during the first weeks of postnatal life, when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. We also found that myofiber formation, during muscle regeneration after freeze injury, was markedly impaired in PKC\u03b8 mutant mice, as compared with WT. This phenotype was associated with reduced expression of the myogenic differentiation program executor, myogenin, but not with that of the SC marker Pax7. Indeed in vitro differentiation of primary muscle-derived SCs from PKC\u03b8 mutants resulted in the formation of thinner myotubes with reduced numbers of myonuclei and reduced fusion rate, when compared with WT cells. These effects were associated to reduced expression of the profusion genes caveolin-3 and \u03b21D integrin and to reduced activation/phosphorylation of their upstream regulator FAK. Indeed the exogenous expression of a constitutively active mutant form of PKC\u03b8 in muscle cells induced FAK phosphorylation. Moreover pharmacologically mediated full inhibition of FAK activity led to similar fusion defects in both WT and PKC\u03b8-null myoblasts. We thus propose that PKC\u03b8 signaling regulates myoblast fusion by regulating, at least in part, FAK activity, essential for profusion gene expression.",

When the muscle is built, postnatal muscle growth and regeneration are guaranteed by satellite cells (SCs), the muscle stem cells, recognized as located between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma, and expressing the SC marker Pax7; these cells are able to recapitulate myogenesis (Holterman and Rudnicki, 2005;Le and Rudnicki, 2007;Kuang and Rudnicki, 2008). A large number of factors regulate muscle precursor differentiation. Pax7-positive cells must escape from their stem cell program through the activation of myogenin and MRF4, which regulate the expression of muscle-specific protein to build the contractile apparatus. An initial phase of myoblast fusion (primary fusion) is required to form nascent myofibers.

We thus systematically measured body weight of PKC\u03b8 \u2212/at different ages during postnatal growth, as compared with that of age-and sex-matched WT mice. As shown in Figure 1A, during the first 4-5 wk of age, the body weight of PKC\u03b8 \u2212/mice was significantly lower than that of WT mice, raising the level of WT body weight only by 5-8 wk. Because skeletal muscle is the tissue that contributes most to body weight, we aimed to verify whether the observed decrease in body weight was due to reduction in skeletal muscle mass. As first, lack of PKC\u03b8 expression in skeletal muscles (tibialis anterior [TA] and extensor digitorum longus [EDL]) of the mutant mice was confirmed by Western blot analysis ( Figure 1A). Indeed muscle mass, as well as muscle fiber size, of 2-mo-old PKC\u03b8 \u2212/hind limb was apparently reduced, as compared with that of WT ( Figure 1B). In fact, morphometric analysis of TA muscle showed that muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) was reduced in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/with respect to WT during the first weeks of postnatal life ( Figure 1B), whereas no significant differences were observed in the total number of fibers (unpublished data). By 3 mo, however, muscle fiber CSA in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/was similar to that of WT mice ( Figure 1B), suggesting that lack of PKC\u03b8 \u2212/delayed postnatal mouse growth, mostly by delaying postnatal skeletal muscle fiber growth.",

            "text": "It is well known that postnatal muscle growth is due to SC (muscle stem cell) differentiation and fusion to preexisting muscle fibers, as well as to each other, to form new fibers. Thus the reduction in muscle mass and myofiber CSA observed during the first weeks of postnatal growth in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/mice suggests that PKC\u03b8 may indeed be required for these processes. To verify this possibility, we first analyzed whether the expression and activation/phosphorylation of PKC\u03b8 was modulated in WT mice during muscle regeneration, a process which recapitulates muscle formation and growth. Muscle regeneration was induced by freeze injury in TA, and protein extracts from TA muscles, dissected at different periods of time (2, 4, and 7 d) after injury, were analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Figure 2A, PKC\u03b8 expression and phosphorylation peaked in regenerating muscle 4-7 d after injury, thus during the period of major fusion and growth of regenerating fibers. Muscle regeneration was then induced in age-and sex-matched PKC\u03b8 \u2212/-. Muscle reorganization was analyzed at morphological level, 4 d after injury when new myofibers started to form (unpublished data), and 7 d after injury, when most regenerating myofibers had formed but were still immature, and compared with WT regenerating muscle ( Figure 2B). Analysis of muscle sections revealed that muscle from mice in which PKC\u03b8 was deleted displayed, at both period of times, the characteristics of delayed regeneration, such as smaller regenerating centronucleated myofibers, heterogeneity in myofiber size, increased number of interstitial cells, and increased interstitial space between myofibers, as compared with time-matched regenerating WT muscle ( Figure 2B, a and b). In keeping with these observations at day 7, although the number of embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC; used as a marker of regenerating myofibers) expressing myofibers in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/mice was similar to that in WT mice ( Figure 2B, c and d), their median CSA was significantly smaller ( Figure 2B, e). As a result, wave (secondary fusion), involving recruitment of mononucleated cells to the nascent myofibers, then completes myofiber growth. Several molecules contribute to myoblast fusion, such as M-cadherin, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), \u03b21D integrin, and caveolin 3. Among them, \u03b21D integrin and caveolin 3 expression has been recently shown to be required for \"secondary\" myoblast fusion, because reduction of any of them dramatically impairs myoblast fusion; their expression appears to be regulated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling, which has thus been proposed as a key player in the fusion process (Quach et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Many studies suggested that PKC is one of the key intermediates in integrin-mediated signaling in many cell types (Disatnik and Rando, 1999;Mostafavi-Pour et al., 2003). Indeed inhibition of PKC activity results in the inhibition of cell attachment and spreading as well as of FAK phosphorylation. PKCs may also directly phosphorylate focal adhesion proteins like talin and filamin (Tigges et al., 2003), allowing the interactions of integrins with the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover activation of PKC can promote the cellular changes mediated by integrin/matrix interactions (Disatnik and Rando, 1999;Disatnik et al., 2002;Connors et al., 2007;Tulla et al., 2008). These observations together demonstrate that PKC plays a specific role in integrin-mediated signal transduction. Because the PKC family of serine/threonine protein kinases comprises at least 12 isoforms, it is still unclear whether different PKC isoforms may play distinct and specific role. PKCs can be subdivided in three subgroups, according to their structure and enzymatic activity: the \"conventional\" PKCs (PKC\u03b1, \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b3), the enzymatic activity of which is calcium and phospholipid dependent, the \"novel\" PKCs (\u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b7, \u03b8, and \u03bc/PKD), the activity of which is calcium independent but phospholipid dependent, and the \"atypical\" PKCs (\u03b6, \u03b9/\u03bb, and \u03c4), the activity of which is calcium and phospholipidindependent. In skeletal muscle, PKC\u03b8 is the PKC isoform predominantly expressed (Osada et al., 1992;Zappelli et al., 1996). In lymphocytes, it acts as a key regulator in their activation and proliferation (Pfeifhofer et al., 2003;Manicassamy et al., 2006;Boschelli, 2009). We recently showed that it is also required for cardiomyocyte survival and cardiac remodeling (Paoletti et al., 2010). Its role in skeletal muscle is not as clear yet, however. We and others have shown that PKC\u03b8 expression in skeletal muscle is developmentally and nerve regulated, and that it mediates various cellular responses (Hilgenberg et al., 1996;Zappelli et al., 1996;Serra et al., 2003;D'Andrea et al., 2006;Gao et al., 2007;Tokugawa et al., 2009;Messina et al., 2010). It is noteworthy that PKC\u03b8 starts to be expressed during the fetal period of development, when muscle mass is built, and it peaks during the first few weeks of postnatal life, when muscle mass needs to grow extensively (Hilgenberg et al., 1996;Zappelli et al., 1996;Messina et al., 2010), suggesting that PKC\u03b8 may be involved in skeletal muscle growth and remodeling. To test this hypothesis, experimentally induced muscle regeneration, which recapitulates most developmental and histogenetic events, may represent a reliable approach. Earlier studies have suggested that multiple PKC isoforms are implicated in muscle-regenerative process, acting differently in times and location and suggesting that individual isoform may fulfill distinct functions (Moraczewski et al., 2002). Indeed during regeneration, an earlier expression of PKC\u03b8 than of the other members of PKC was observed in rats (Moraczewski et al., 2002). More recently, restriction of PKC\u03b8 immunoreactivity in SCs was described in regenerating rat TA, suggesting a role in SC maintenance and/or activation (Tokugawa et al., 2009). We here aimed to investigate the role of PKC\u03b8 in muscle regeneration in vivo and SC differentiation in vitro, using two different models of PKC\u03b8-null mice: a PKC\u03b8 knockout model, in which the PKC\u03b8 gene was inactivated in all after injury, muscle morphology seemed similar in control and PKC\u03b8 \u2212/muscles, in terms of muscle fiber CSA and muscle organization (unpublished data), showing that there clearly are compensatory mechanisms that ultimately result in effective regeneration even if significantly delayed compared with control muscle.",

As shown in Figure 3A, PKC\u03b8 expression was strongly up-regulated within 8 h in differentiation medium (DM), and most of the protein was associated to the particulate fraction, as a feature of PKC activation. In vitro differentiation of primary myoblasts derived from PKC\u03b8 mutant mice was then compared with that of WT myoblasts. The cells were fixed after 48 h in DM and were either stained with Wright's solution or immunostained with the anti-sarcomeric myosin heavy chain MF20 antibody. As shown in Figure 3B, by 48 h in DM, WT myoblasts had formed elongated myotubes containing a large number of nuclei; in contrast, PKC\u03b8 \u2212/myoblasts exhibited minimal fusion. To quantify these observations, fusion rate was evaluated by counting the number of nuclei included in myosin-positive myotubes (containing \u2265 3 nuclei) divided by the total number of nuclei. As shown in Figure 3B, the fusion rate in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/muscle cell cultures was almost 50% with respect to WT cells. To verify whether \"secondary\" myogenesis (addition of nuclei to already formed myotubes) was actually impaired, the number of nuclei per myotube was evaluated; as shown in Figure 3B, the mean number of nuclei per myotube was significantly lower in PKC\u03b8null cultures, as compared with WT. After culturing the cells for longer periods of time, the number of myotubes was approximately the same, as both cultures already reached the plateau stage by 48 h in DM. Fusion continued in both genotypes, but the fusion rate differences were still maintained (unpublished data). To verify whether similar defects may account for the reduced myofiber CSA observed in vivo, isolated myofibers were prepared from EDL muscle of 2-mo-old mice, and nuclei were counted by means of TO-PRO-3 staining. Nuclei included in myofiber-associated SCs were identified as located outside the sarcolemma. Indeed the number of nuclei in freshly isolated PKC\u03b8 \u2212/myofibers was significantly lower than that in WT ones, whereas the number of SCs per myofiber was not altered (Figures 3C and Supplemental Figure S1).",

In fact, Western blot analysis revealed that, whereas in WT muscle eMyHC expression was increasing by the time of regeneration, in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/its expression increased at 4 d after injury, but then it did not further increase ( Figure 2C). To verify whether the observed alterations in muscle regeneration were due to impairment of SCs activation and/or differentiation, the expression of the SC marker Pax7 and of the myogenic differentiation executor myogenin was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Figure 2C, Pax7 expression was highly increased in both mutant and WT mice at day 4 after injury, at a similar extent, and then decreased by day 7 similarly in both mutant and WT mice. In contrast, the strong up-regulation of myogenin expression in WT mice at day 4 after injury was prevented in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/mice; moreover the following down-regulation observed in WT mice 7 d after injury, as an indicator of the resolution of the differentiation process, was not observed in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/-, where the level of expression of myogenin was only slightly lower than that observed at day 4 after injury.

Similar to what was observed during regeneration in vivo, Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of Pax7 was high in both PKC\u03b8 \u2212/and WT cells cultured in GM, as well as after 1 d in DM; after 2 d in DM, the expression of Pax7 was almost undetectable in both PKC\u03b8 \u2212/and WT cells ( Figure 5A). In contrast, the expression of myogenin, following similar time-course kinetics in both genotypes, was lower in mutant cells with respect to WT cells, at all the time points considered ( Figure 5A). Surprisingly, the expression level of muscle-specific genes, such as sarcomeric myosin, was similar in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/and WT differentiated cells ( Figure 5A). In contrast, the expected up-regulation of both \u03b21D integrin and caveolin-3 expression, recently shown to be essential for myoblast fusion (Quach et al., 2009), observed in WT myoblasts after 1 d in DM, was significantly reduced in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/myoblasts To confirm the requirement of PKC\u03b8 for myoblast fusion using a different approach, primary myoblasts were prepared from a different mouse model, the mPKC\u03b8K/R mouse (Serra et al., 2003), in which the expression of a kinase dead mutant form of PKC\u03b8 cDNA is driven by the muscle-specific enhancer of the desmin promoter; thus the activity of PKC\u03b8 is selectively inhibited in differentiating myoblasts. mPKC\u03b8K/R myoblasts behaved similarly to the PKC\u03b8 \u2212/ones at the morphological level, giving rise to thin, oligonucleated myotubes in culture (unpublished data). Accordingly, the expression of \u03b21D integrin and caveolin-3 was prevented at day 1 in DM, as compared with WT myoblasts (Figure 5B). At day 2 in DM, the expression level of \u03b21D integrin and caveolin-3 in both PKC\u03b8 mutant cells was still reduced, although to a lesser extent, with respect to WT cells.

As shown in Figure 6A, Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that lack of expression/activity of PKC\u03b8 significantly prevented FAK activation/phosphorylation during myoblast differentiation in vitro, as compared with WT myoblasts. To verify whether PKC\u03b8 signaling actually leads to FAK phosphorylation, a constitutively active mutant form of PKC\u03b8 (PKC\u03b8A/E;D'Andrea et al., 2006) was transfected in C2C12 cells (a mouse muscle cell line) cultured in GM. Parallel cultures were mock transfected. The ability of the exogenously expressed PKC\u03b8 mutant form to drive FAK phosphorylation was evaluated 16 h after transfection, by double immunofluorescence using the anti-phospho-FAK and the anti-PKC\u03b8 antibodies. As shown in Figure 6B, a-d, whereas no p-FAK-positive or PKC\u03b8-positive cells were detectable in mock-transfected cells, all the PKC\u03b8-expressing cells, in PKC\u03b8A/Etransfected cultures, coexpressed p-FAK. In parallel, another group of plates was processed for immunoprecipitation using the anti-FAK antibody. The immunoprecipitate was then analyzed by Western blot for p-FAK and for total FAK content. As shown in Figure 6B, increased FAK phosphorylation was observed in PKC\u03b8A/E-transfected cultures compared with mock-transfected cultures. To verify whether the observed decrease in FAK phosphorylation is the main event driving the phenotype, WT and PKC\u03b8 \u2212/primary muscle cells were cultured in the presence of the FAK inhibitor 14 (Beierle et al., 2010), and both fusion rate and the number of nuclei per myotube were evaluated. As shown in Figure 6C, full FAK inhibition, by means of the inhibitor, strongly reduced fusion rate and number of nuclei per myotube in both WT and PKC\u03b8 \u2212/cultures to a similar extent. Moreover upregulation of both \u03b21D integrin and caveolin-3 was similarly prevented in both WT and PKC\u03b8 \u2212/treated cells ( Figure 6D).",

As first, lack of PKC\u03b8 in vivo resulted in reduced mice weight during the first weeks of postnatal life. The observed reduction was associated with reduction in both muscle mass and myofiber CSA. By 8-12 wk of postnatal life, both body weight and myofiber CSA in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/mice were similar to those in WT mice, suggesting that lack of PKC\u03b8 delays the initial growth and building of the muscle mass. Indeed a reduction in lean muscle has previously been reported in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/mice with respect to WT (Gao et al., 2007). The fact that PKC\u03b8 is required for muscle growth is further supported by the observed delay in muscle regeneration. Experimentally induced muscle regeneration is a valuable model to recapitulate myofiber differentiation and growth. We show in this article that PKC\u03b8 expression was strongly up-regulated 4 d after injury, just during the phase of muscle rebuilding. This observation is consistent with a previously published study that showed that PKC\u03b8 activity increased significantly during the final phases of muscle regeneration in rat (Moraczewski et al., 2002). Indeed we show that lack of PKC\u03b8 delayed muscle rebuilding after injury. The observed delay can be accounted for by impairment of the late phases of the growth/regeneration process. In fact, whereas no alteration in the expression of early markers of activated SCs, such as Pax7, was observed, full up-regulation of myogenin expression, an \"executor\" of myogenesis, was prevented, as well as the expression of the terminal differentiation marker of regenerating myofibers, eMyHC. More important, the size of regenerating myofibers, identified as eMyHC-positive myofibers, was significantly smaller in PKC \u2212/regenerating muscle than in time-matching regenerating WT muscle. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that, FIGURE 6: PKC\u03b8 expression/activity is required for FAK phosphorylation.

As we show here, PKC\u03b8 is poorly expressed in proliferating myoblasts, but its expression is strongly up-regulated upon differentiation. Altogether, these observations suggest that, although FAK activation is a common feature, different PKC isoforms can be involved in cell to extracellular matrix and in cell-to-cell interactions, where different integrins are involved, and we show in the present study that activation of the \u03b8 isoform is indeed involved in FAK-mediated signaling leading to myoblast fusion. The fact that pharmacologically mediated full inhibition of FAK activity leads to similar fusion defects in both WT and PKC\u03b8-null myoblasts further supports the hypothesis that the decreased FAK activation observed in PKC\u03b8-null cells is sufficient to cause the phenotype. However, since no full FAK inhibition is observed in PKC\u03b8-null myoblasts, other pathways might also contribute to FAK activation.",

            "text": "Accordingly, we show that PKC\u03b8 expression and activity were strongly induced in cultured muscle-derived cells within a few hours in DM, and inhibition of its expression (in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/muscle-derived cells) or activity (in mPKC\u03b8K/R muscle-derived cells) significantly reduced fusion index and myonuclei content, as compared with WT cells. This defect was actually dependent on a defect in the fusion process itself, because no differences in the nature of the cell populations obtained from the different genotypes were observed, and, when cells were clonally cultured, no differences in cell proliferation or in cell death were observed. Indeed single clones from PKC\u03b8 \u2212/muscle-derived cells still gave rise to thinner, oligonucleated myotubes, as compared with clones derived from WT cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PKC\u03b8 plays a critical role in myoblast fusion and myofiber growth, which can be referred to as \"secondary fusion.\" This conclusion is further strengthened by the observation that the number of nuclei in PKC\u03b8 \u2212/freshly isolated myofibers was lower than that in WT ones, suggesting that similar alterations are occurring in vivo as well. Many factors have been shown to be implicated in myoblast fusion, including components of the extracellular matrix remodeling, such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 (Lluri and Jaworski, 2005;Lluri et al., 2008); cell surface molecules, such as NCAM, N-and M-cadherins, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 12, \u03b21 integrins, and caveolin-3 (Galbiati et al., 1999;Abmayr et al., 2003;Gullberg, 2003;Horsley and Pavlath, 2004); or even cytokines, such as interleukin 4 (IL-4; Horsley et al., 2003). Whereas the activity of MMP-2 and -9 was not altered by ablation of PKC\u03b8 expression/activity (our unpublished observations), we show in this article that the up-regulation of \u03b21D integrin and of caveolin-3 upon differentiation was significantly prevented. Thus PKC\u03b8 activity appears to be involved in signaling pathways regulating the expression of molecules involved in myoblast fusion. To date, a clear picture of these pathways is not depicted yet; however, full activation of caveolin-3 and \u03b21D integrin expression has been recently shown to be required for \"secondary fusion\" and dependent on FAK activation (Quach et al., 2009). Indeed full FAK phosphorylation was prevented when PKC\u03b8 expression/activity was ablated in differentiating myoblasts, by either knocking the gene out or by expressing a dominant-negative mutant form. Accordingly, when a constitutively active PKC\u03b8 mutant form was exogenously expressed in cultured muscle cells, FAK phosphorylation was induced, demonstrating that PKC\u03b8, either directly or indirectly, is involved in FAK activation. Several studies have indicated that PKC activation is required for FAK phosphorylation in cell-to-extracellular-matrix adhesion events and that they colocalize at focal adhesion sites (Vuori and Ruoslahti, 1993;Haimovich et al., 1996;Disatnik and Rando, 1999). The precise functional relationship between these two kinases, however, is not completely understood yet. It has been previously shown that, during muscle cell adhesion and spreading, integrin engagement leads to FAK phosphorylation via a PKC-dependent signaling pathway (Disatnik and Rando, 1999); among the PKC isoforms analyzed, sequential activation of PKC\u03b5, -\u03b1, and -\u03b4 has been shown to be necessary to promote muscle cell spreading (Disatnik et al., 2002). It is worth noting that in those studies no PKC\u03b8 expression was detected; thus its involvement in those events was ruled out. Indeed those studies were carried out using proliferating muscle cells, because cell adhesion and spreading",

The obtained homogenate was disrupted by sonication, incubated for 30 min on ice with repeated vortexing, and then centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. For the preparation of subcellular protein fractions, the cell pellet was homogenized in H-buffer lacking Triton X-100, and incubated 30 min on ice. Samples were then spun at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was saved as cytosolic fraction, and the remaining pellet was suspended in H-buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated for 30 min on ice. At the end, the samples were spun at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, and the remaining supernatant was saved as the particulate fraction. An equal amount of protein from each sample was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Roche Applied Science) or ALP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) were used as secondary antibodies, and immunoreactive bands were detected using CDP-STAR solution (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Densitometric analysis was performed using Aida 2.1 Image software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).",
