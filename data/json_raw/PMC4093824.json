We analyzed 60K SNP chips on 279 chickens with GEMMA methods for GWAS and estimated the genetic heritability for plumage color. The estimated heritability suggests that plumage coloration is a polygenic trait. We found new loci associated with feather pigmentation at the genome-wide level and from the results infer that there are additional genetic effect for plumage color. The results will be used for selecting and breeding chicken for plumage color uniformity.",

To increase the productivity of native chickens, they were bred for economic traits. Although this process resulted in higher productivity, at the same time it decreased genetic diversity (Tadano et al., 2007). In recent years, it has become increasingly important to protect national endemic genetic resources and use local breeds to create commercial strains that can adapt to the changing environment.",

            "text": "Woorimatdag has contributed to the industrialization of KNCs because of its rapid growth and the texture of the meat in comparison to the native chickens (Park, 2010). However, the use KNC H strain in the paternal line to create Woorimatdag has led to the decrease in plumage uniformity. Unlike typical white broilers, KNCs usually have colored feathers and various pigmentation patterns. Plumage color is an important factor that is used by consumers to distinguish between KNC strains. Although plumage color is easily observed, the genetics behind the feather coloration is governed by both qualitative and quantitative features (Klungland and Vage, 2000). In chickens, mutations in MC1R and TYR genes have been shown to be associated with feather pigmentation (Kerje et al., 2003;Liu et al., 2010). However, there is a lack of research on the genetics of plumage coloration in Korean chicken at the genomewide scale. The purpose of this study is to characterize the genetic polymorphism underlying different plumage color using the chicken 60K SNP chip through GWAS (genomewide association study) and to increase plumage color uniformity of Woorimatdag. The results will also be used for selecting and breeding KNC H strain. (KNCH), 9 KNC S stains (KNCS), 9 KNC R stains (KNCR), and 11 KNC L strains (KNCL). The plumage colors of these strains range from black, black with brown, brown, red-brown, and black. KNC H strain chickens can have black to black and brown plumage and the individuals were classified into seven categories according to the number of body parts it exhibited brown plumage. Plumage color was scored for six specific body parts: head, neck, breast, back, wings, and tail. If the individual only had black feather, it was given a score of zero, however, if an individual showed brown plumage, for every body part it had brown it received 1 point. This classified the individuals into seven categories, ranging from all black to brown in all scored body parts. Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes and DNA was extracted using Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The genomic DNA samples were genotyped using the 60K SNP Illumina iSelect chicken array (Illumina Inc., USA).",

As genomic inflation factor is 0.987, it can be concluded that the GWAS result is not inflated by considering relatedness using GEMMA (Figure 3). Among the significant SNPs, we identified 4 susceptibility SNPs: rs14339964 (Gga3:36327458, p = 4.07 \uf0b410 -9 ), GGaluGA344987 (Gga3:705798, p = 1.12\uf0b410 -6 ), rs14641648 (Gga8:12987908, p = 2.06\uf0b410 -6 ), and GGaluGA193591 (Gga24:5696828, p = 2.38\uf0b410 -6 ) in the population (Table 2). SNP rs14339964 at Gga3:36327458 is located in an intron region of AKT3 which is known to be regulators of cell signaling in response to insulin and growth factors and involved in a wide variety of biological processes. AKT3 is one of the key genes in the formation of melanoma cells (Tsao et al., 2012). Previous studies reported that through gene-environment interactions pigmentation pathways can contribute to the formation for melanoma and tumours (Gudbjartsson et al., 2008;Ibarrola-Villava et al., 2012). Thus, we indirectly infer that AKT3 mutations may be related to plumage pigmentation. Both SNPs, GGaluGA344987 at Gga3:705798 and rs14641648 at Gga8:12987908, are located in an intergenic region around KRT7 and PAP2 which are associated with pigmentation.

KRT7 is a member of the keratin gene family and is related with melanocytic tumors (Blum et al., 2010). DDX6 encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family, which has multiple functions including translation suppression and mRNA degradation (Weston and Sommerville, 2006). DDX6 is a previously confirmed gene for vitiligo which is a disease related with pigmentation of skin (Tang et al., 2012). Interestingly, although rs15175679 (Gga20: 8397089, p = 3.91\uf0b410 -6 ) is not significant, the variant exits in gga-mir-668 which is a region that harbors a small RNA. Previous studies of chicken embryogenesis has shown that this small RNA regulates developmental signaling pathways (Shao et al., 2012). The results of GWAS of head plumage, wing plumage, breast plumage, back plumage, neck plumage and tail plumage traits, separately identified the same SNPs: rs14339964 and rs15616451 (near gene: AKT3, ENSGALG00000020136) as the result of GWAS with the whole body trait. Through the concordant result, we infer that quantitative analysis of whole body plumage is not a simple trait (Table 3). The feather pigmentation related genes including MC1R, TYR, PMEL, MLPH, ASIP, SOX10, and SLC34A2 are well known. However, the related loci of these genes were not found in this study. The chicken 60K SNP chip does not contain SNPs of the MC1R region, and so we could not identify the effects of MC1R in this study. The results of this study are nevertheless meaningful in that novel loci affecting pigmentation at genome-wide level were found. Estimated genetic heritability was 18.2%, but estimated  Figure 2.
