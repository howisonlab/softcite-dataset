            "text": "Background-Hypertensive disorders are the most common in pregnancy. Several studies showed a positive correlation between elevated maternal serum uric acid (UA), serum creatinine and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, but only a few studies are available on serum cystatin C and maternal and fetal outcomes. The present study was undertaken to study the association of serum UA, creatinine and cystatin C with maternal and fetal outcomes. Methods-Out of 116 pregnant women 69 women had no hypertension and 47 had hypertension with or without proteinuria. Serum UA, creatinine and cystatin C was measured by modified Uricase method, modified kinetic Jaffe's reaction and particle-enhanced immunonephelometric assay respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the independent effects of serum UA, creatinine and cystatin C on maternal and fetal outcomes using stata 13.1. Results-The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 3.73 (95% CI: 1.18-11.75; P=0.024) for UA; 15.79 (95% CI: 3.04-81.94; P=0.001) for creatinine and 2.03 (95% CI: 0.70-5.87; P=0.192) for cystatin C in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. All the three renal parameters were not significantly associated with birth weight, gestational age of delivery and mode of delivery after adjusting for the confounding factors. Conclusions-Serum creatinine and uric acid are independent risk factors for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. High serum uric acid is associated with low birth weight and delivery by caesarian section whereas high serum creatinine with preterm delivery only before adjustment for This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License, which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited."

            "text": "Hypertensive disorders account for approximately 2%-10% of all pregnancies. 1,2 Among these pre-eclampsia (PE) is one of the major causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide whereas uncomplicated gestational hypertension has a better prognosis. Gestational hypertension is defined as the new onset gestational hypertension after the 20 th week of gestation but without proteinuria. 3 PE is characterized by new onset gestational hypertension after the 20 th week of gestation, proteinuria and impaired renal function. 3 Due to hormonal and hemodynamic changes of pregnancy, renal function is altered and more so in hypertensive disorders and hence these changes must be considered when assessing renal function in pregnancy. Serum Uric acid (UA), serum creatinine and more recently serum cystatin C levels are the indices of renal function. Several studies have reported a positive correlation between elevated maternal serum UA, serum creatinine and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. [4][5][6][7][8][9][10] We found one study showing an association of high plasma cystatin C levels and PE which reflects the acute kidney dysfunction associated with PE but we did not find studies showing the relationship between serum cystatin C and the fetal outcomes. 11 We hypothesize that elevated levels of serum UA, serum Creatinine and serum cystatin C are associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes and hence in our study we would like to evaluate the relationship between the above mentioned parameters and the maternal and fetal outcomes.",

The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, birth weight, gestational age of delivery and mode of delivery were treated as the dependent variables and serum UA, serum creatinine and serum cystatin C as independent variables. Both dependent and independent variables were dichotomized. Hypertension, birth weight and gestational age of delivery were dichotomized using the standard cut-off values. 3,17,18 The cut-offs for dichotomization were taken as 5.88 mg/dl for serum uric acid, 19 0.8 mg/dl for serum creatinine 16 and 1.3 mg/L for serum cystatin c. 16 Serum uric acid \u2265 5.88 mg/dl, serum creatinine \u2265 0.8 mg/dl and serum cystatin C \u2265 1.3 mg/L were coded as 1 and those less than the cut-offs were coded as 0. For each outcome the first model was unadjusted and the second model was adjusted for the covariates as possible confounders in the analysis.

            "text": "The association between raised serum uric acid and preeclampsia was first reported in 1917. 20 The elevation in serum uric acid and serum creatinine may be attributed to reduced uric acid and creatinine clearance secondary to reduced glomerular filtration rate, increased reabsorption and decreased secretion in women with pre-eclampsia. [21][22][23] The pathophysiologic mechanisms of pre-eclampsia comprising increased trophoblastic tissue shedding, endothelial dysfunction, and reduced blood flow in the fetomaternal unit have also been hypothesized as the underlying cause of hyperuricemia in this condition. 24 The elevation in serum cystatin C in pregnancy might be due to increased production due to increase in the number of nucleated cells. 16 Several studies have reported a positive correlation between elevated maternal serum uric acid levels and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. [4][5][6][7][8][25][26][27] There was disagreement in serum uric acid and serum creatinine as predictors of hypertensive disorders. Studies done by weerasekara D.S et al, Manjareeka M et al concluded that serum uric acid and serum creatinine are not predictive of pre-eclampsia and Thangaratinam S et al concluded that serum uric acid is not predictive of preeclampsia. 19,23,28 However, Studies done by Roberts et al and Bellomo et al found uric acid to be predictive of gestational hypertension. 6,29 Our findings of serum uric acid as an independent risk factor for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy agree with the study done by Gianni Bellomo et al and Roberts et al. 6,29 We did not observe any significant association between serum cystatin C and the development of hypertensive disorders in contrast to the study done by Franceschini et al. 11 There are studies to show the association of high serum uric acid levels with the preterm delivery and small for gestational age but in our study we found an association between high serum creatinine (\u2265 0.8 mg/dl) and preterm delivery but not with high serum uric acid and serum cystatin C. 6,30 Also we found in our study that pregnant women with high uric acid levels (\u2265 5.88 mg/dl) are associated with low birth weight (<2.5 kg) similar to the studies done by Akahori et al, Sagen et al and Schuster et al but serum creatinine and serum cystatin C were not found to be associated with low birth weight. [31][32][33] Our findings of high uric acid levels associated with caesarian section agree with the study done by Patel et al. 30 The variability in the findings can be explained by the differences in the population, definitions of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and test cut-off values. Our study is limited by the small sample size for each hypertensive disorder group of pregnant women. Also the associations of the three renal parameters with maternal outcomes like the complications of PE and fetal outcomes like Intra Uterine Growth Retardation (IUGR), still births, neonatal deaths, small for gestational age (SGA) and Apgar score have not been studied.",
