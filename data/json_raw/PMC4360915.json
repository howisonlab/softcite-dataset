            "text": "Background: Statherin is an important salivary protein for maintaining oral health. The purpose of the current study was to determine if differences in statherin levels exist between diabetic and healthy subjects. Methods: A total of 48 diabetic and healthy controls were randomly selected from a community-based database. Diabetic subjects (n = 24) had fasting glucose levels N 180 mg/dL, while controls (n = 24) had levels b 110 mg/dL. Parotid saliva (PS) and sublingual/submandibular saliva (SS) were collected and salivary flow rates determined. Salivary statherin levels were determined by densitometry of Western blots. Blood hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and total protein in saliva were also obtained. Results: SS, but not PS, salivary flow rate and total protein in diabetics were significantly less than those in healthy controls (p = 0.021 & p b 0.001 respectively). Correlation analysis revealed the existence of a negative correlation between PS statherin levels and HbA1c (p = 0.012) and fasting glucose (p = 0.021) levels, while no such correlation was found for SS statherin levels. When statherin levels were normalized to total salivary protein, the proportion of PS statherin, but not SS statherin, in diabetics was significantly less than that in controls (p = 0.032). In contrast, the amount of statherin secretion in SS, but not PS, was significantly decreased in diabetics compared to controls (p = 0.016). Conclusions and general significance: The results show that synthesis and secretion of statherin is reduced in diabetics and this reduction is salivary gland specific. As compromised salivary statherin secretion leads to increased oral health risk, this study indicates that routine oral health assessment of these patients is warranted.",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a growing global epidemic with more than 439 million projected to be affected by 2030 [3]. Oral diseases, such as periodontitis, dental caries, fungal infection, xerostomia, and salivary gland dysfunction, are all major complications associated with diabetes [6,17]. Saliva contains a number of components, such as electrolytes, multiple buffering systems, digestive enzymes, lubricant glycoproteins, and antimicrobial proteins, to maintain oral homeostasis and preserve the health of the teeth and oral mucosa and prevent infection. Therefore, salivary dysfunction may account for a number of the oral diseases associated with diabetes and may be a risk factor for these patients. Indeed, decreased salivary flow rates have been documented in clinical cohort studies and animal models of diabetes [17,23,31]. Further, a limited number of studies have reported changes in saliva composition, such as amylase, total protein and antimicrobial proteins, in diabetic patients [6,14,23,27].",

            "text": "Human salivary statherin is a low molecular weight phosphoprotein, containing 43 amino acids, that functions to inhibit spontaneous precipitation of calcium and phosphate salts (primary precipitation) from saliva and the growth of hydroxyapatite crystals (secondary precipitation) on the surface of the teeth [18,20]. In addition, statherin is a major component of the \"acquired\" dental pellicle and functions to regulate mineralization at the surface through binding of its hydrophilic N-terminal domain to hydroxyapatite and selection of oral microorganisms that bind to the pellicle through its C-terminal domain [7,18,20]. Further, the level of statherin in whole saliva has been reported to be higher in caries-free patients than in caries-susceptible patients and those with elevated decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) indices [29]. Based on these observations, it is generally believed that statherin plays a critical role in protecting oral tissues from a number of common dental disorders (e.g., periodontal diseases, dental caries and oral mucosa infections) [11,25].",

In other studies, statherin expression in labial, submandibular, and parotid gland tissue, obtained from control and diabetic (type 2) patients undergoing head and neck tumor resection, was examined using immunogold labeling and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Statherin immunoreactivity was detected in small vesicles, diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm of labial serous cells, and in secretory granules of serous acinar cells in both submandibular and parotid glands [11][12][13]. Detailed statistical analyses revealed that the number of stained particles was significantly lower in tissues of diabetic subjects than non-diabetic controls. Recent proteome and peptidome analyses of saliva from children with type 1 diabetes also suggest a relatively lower production of statherin than those in controls [1].",

            "text": "Patients with diabetes (both types 1 and 2) are known to have altered salivary gland function such as decreased flow rates and altered composition [2,6,14,23,27]. In the present study, we observed that stimulated SS flow rates were significantly decreased in diabetic subjects. We did not detect any significant decrease in stimulated PS flow rates in diabetes as indicated by some previously published studies [2]. The reason for these discrepancies in measures of salivary function with diabetes may be due to cohort effects, large individual variations, and sample sizes. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to  document decreased statherin levels in glandular saliva of type 2 diabetics. Previously, a quantitative peptidomic study of whole saliva suggested a decrease in salivary statherin levels of type 1 diabetic patients [1]. A lower immunoreactive statherin level in parotid, submandibular and labial glands from diabetic patients has also been reported using an immunogold transmission electron microscopy approach [11,12]. The effect of diabetes on statherin secretion appears to be more pronounced on PS than SS as statistically significant differences were only observed in PS (see Table 2, % statherin levels and % statherin levels normalized to protein). Since no differences in PS flow rate and total protein concentrations were found between healthy controls and diabetics (Table 1), statherin levels in PS appear to be directly influenced by the hyperglycemia of diabetes mellitus. This conclusion is further supported by our results showing a negative correlation between PS statherin levels and HbA1c and fasting glucose levels (see Fig. 2). However, prior studies have reported that immunoreactive statherin is only present in serous acinar cells. The less pronounced effect of diabetes on statherin levels in SS may be due to differences in the acini of these two glands. In addition, in the present study, the effect of diabetes on statherin production by individual submandibular and sublingual glands could not be evaluated as we did not collect separate saliva samples from these two glands [28].",

Prior studies have shown that statherin concentrations increase with salivary flow rates [16]. The decrease in median statherin levels in SS of diabetic patients, although not significant, may relate to the significantly reduced salivary flow rates found in diabetes (see Fig. 1). Currently, the cellular Fig. 2. Correlation between salivary statherin levels and fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels in patients with diabetes and healthy age-and gender-matched controls. Normalized statherin levels in stimulated parotid saliva (PS, panels A and C) and stimulated submandibular/sublingual saliva (SS, panels B and D) were plotted against HbA1c (panels A and B) or fasting blood glucose (panels C and D) levels. A significant negative correlation was found between PS statherin and HbA1c (panel A) and fasting blood glucose (panel C). The data shown are the median value for each parameter; the 25th and 75th percentile values are shown in parentheses. The % statherin level in a 0.125 \u03bcL aliquot of saliva was calculated in relation to the amount measured in a pre-screened PS sample of equal volume as described in Materials and methods section. These data were then normalized to the total protein content in a \u03bcL saliva (=% statherin level/total protein). Total statherin secretion was calculated by multiplying the % statherin level/total protein in a \u03bcL saliva by salivary flow rate (mL/min).

            "text": "and molecular mechanisms, responsible for inducing salivary gland dysfunction in diabetes, are unclear. Morphological, immunolabeling and functional studies of salivary glands, using experimental animal models and clinical samples, indicate that diabetes leads to changes in the autonomic nervous system [22,31], lower expression of cyclic AMP receptors and secretory proteins (e.g., amylase, proline-rich proteins, and mucins) [21,24], and structural changes in cellular organelles (e.g., increased acinar and secretory granule area, reduced mitochrondria size, and increased membrane folding) [19,31] as compared to normal salivary gland cells. Whether these alterations contribute to, or are associated with, differences in salivary statherin levels between diabetes and healthy controls require further study. Nevertheless, statherin, an abundant salivary protein as our results demonstrate, can serve as a marker for studying the effect of diabetes on salivary function. Statherin is a major salivary protein with multiple physiological functions. Reduced statherin levels in PS and total statherin secretion in SS can put diabetic patients at risk for a number of oral diseases. Indeed, statherin levels have been associated with elevated decayed, missing, and filled teeth/surfaces (DMFT/DMFS) indices [29]. While a direct correlation between statherin levels and DMFTs were not found in the current study, the DMFT index for crown and roots were both higher in diabetic patients compared to the healthy non-diabetic controls and confirmed previous studies demonstrating an association between diabetes and DMFT [15,17]. Thus far, the association of dental caries and diabetes has not been well documented [17]. In contrast, diabetic patients are known to be at a higher risk for more severe periodontal diseases [17]. The lower salivary flow rates and periodontal diseases among diabetic patients may partially explain the higher DMFT-c and DMFT-r in diabetic patients [10,17]. In our cohort, the differences in DMFTs may derive from missing teeth since the diabetic group has significantly more missing teeth (data not shown). Whether the missing teeth are due to periodontal disease or caries is currently unclear. Regardless, the lower statherin concentration and secretions in this study suggest a potential major risk for oral diseases in diabetic patients.",

In addition, statherin levels in PS were negatively correlated with blood glucose and HbA1c levels. We have further demonstrated that diabetic patients have a higher DMFT index and lower salivary flow rates. Alterations in statherin level and secretion, in combination with compromised salivary flow rates, may account for the higher incidence of oral complications in diabetic patients. Oral diseases, especially periodontal diseases have been linked to diabetic control, further emphasizing that oral health maintenance should be an integral part of diabetic management [17].",
