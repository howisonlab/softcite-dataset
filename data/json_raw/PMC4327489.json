            "text": "bjective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of adverse effects reported by adolescents following 14 days of use of a mouthrinse containing 0.05% NaF+0.12% chlorhexidine. Methods: This double-blind study was developed as part of a randomized clinical trial. The adolescents enrolled to the study were randomly divided into two groups to use either: 0.05% NaF+0.12% chlorhexidine (G1, n=85) or 0.05% NaF (G2, n=85). Both groups used a 10mL solution of the mouthwash during 1 minute daily for 2 weeks under supervision. After that period, the subject's acceptance of taste was measured using a verbal descriptive scale (Labeled Magnitude Scale-LMS) 11. Participants were also interviewed regarding the occurrence of possible adverse effects during treatment (temporary palate disorders, tooth staining or unpleasant taste). The proportional differences between the groups were tested using the chi-square test. Results: Palate changes were reported by 26% of participants of each group; 17.7% of G1 and 32% of G2 reported an unpleasant taste (p = 0.062), while staining was reported by 55% of G1 and 68.9% of G2 (p = 0.117). Absenteeism rates were similar in both groups (G1= 2.58 \u00b1 2.69; G2=2.81 \u00b1 2.39), p=0.362. Conclusion: adherence was high in both groups and side effects reported by subjects were not perceived by them as being important. Since subjects' acceptance and compliance is fundamental to the success of an oral health program, chlorhexidinefluoride could be a useful resource in a program of plaque control. Uniterms: Mouthwashes; Chlorhexidine, adverse effects; Randomized clinical trials. bjetivo: Este estudo se prop\u00f4s a calcular taxa de efeitos adversos ap\u00f3s 14 dias de uso de solu\u00e7\u00e3o de bochecho de NaF 0,05% + clorexidina 0,12% realizados por adolescentes. M\u00e9todos: Este estudo duplo-cego foi desenvolvido como parte de um ensaio cl\u00ednico randomizado. Os adolescentes foram divididos aleatoriamente em dois grupos: NaF 0,05% + clorexidina 0,12% (G1) ou NaF 0,05%, (G2) de 85 estudantes cada que bochecharam diariamente, 10mL de solu\u00e7\u00e3o sob supervis\u00e3o, durante 1 minuto, por 2 semanas. Ap\u00f3s esse per\u00edodo, a aceita\u00e7\u00e3o dos participantes ao gosto das solu\u00e7\u00f5es foi avaliada atrav\u00e9s de uma escala descritiva verbal-(LMS) 11. Os participantes foram entrevistados tamb\u00e9m quanto a poss\u00edveis efeitos adversos acontecidos durante tratamentos (desordens tempor\u00e1rias de paladar, manchamento dental e o gosto de solu\u00e7\u00f5es desagrad\u00e1veis). As diferen\u00e7as entre propor\u00e7\u00f5es em ambos os grupos foram testadas pelo teste do qui-quadrado. Resultados: Altera\u00e7\u00e3o de paladar foi informada por 26% dos estudantes de cada grupo; 17,7% dos G1 e 32% do G2 notaram o gosto desagrad\u00e1vel (p = 0,062); manchas foram observadas por 55% dos G1 e 68,9% dos G2 (p = 0,117) e, as taxas de absente\u00edsmo foram semelhantes (G1 = 2,58\u00b12,69; G2=2,81(2,39), p=0,362. Conclus\u00e3o: A ader\u00eancia dos participantes foi alta e os efeitos colaterais percebidos n\u00e3o pareceram importantes pelos adolescentes nos dois grupos. Implica\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e1tica: porquanto a aceita\u00e7\u00e3o e ader\u00eancia dos participantes s\u00e3o fundamentais para o sucesso de um programa de sa\u00fade bucal, a associa\u00e7\u00e3o da clorexidina-fluoreto poderia ser um recurso adicional favor\u00e1vel dentro de um programa de controle de placa.",

An antimicrobial agent should inhibit the adhesion stage of bacterial colonization, and affect the growth and metabolic activity of dental plaque, without, however, interfering with any other biological process. In addition, its toxicity must be low, since such solutions could be inadvertently swallowed 24 . The enhancement of the cariostatic effect of the fluoride by its combination with antimicrobial agents has been suggested 16 and this combination has been shown to be effective in arresting caries lesions in irradiated patients with minimal salivary buffering capacity due to lower saliva flow rates 16 Chlorhexidine is the most commonly used antimicrobial substance because of its proven efficacy in altering membrane function, controlling oral biofilm and inhibiting the metabolism of microorganisms. In addition, it interferes with the acid production of dental plaque, reducing the pH level during cariogenic challenges 22 .",

Consumption of some chromogenic agents 17 , such as coffee or tea, for example, may also increase toothstaining 17 , which is one of the most recognized problems associated with chlorhexidine. Cationic antiseptics, such as chlorhexidine, may activate anionic chromatic particles contained in some food and drinks, causing interaction with tooth surfaces 1 . In vitro, these colored particles can produce identically colored complexes such as those caused by chlorhexidine and observed clinically in individuals who drink tea, coffee or red wine compared with those who do not ingest these drinks 17 . Randomized controlled clinical trials have shown that tea and coffee associated with the use of chlorhexidine mouthrinses contribute significantly to staining the teeth and tongue. On the other hand, abstaining from tea and coffee notably reduces this effect 17 .",

It is difficult to compare the results of this present study with those from previous randomized clinical trials due the variability of fluoride and chlorhexidine combinations, concentrations, pharmaceutical presentation (gels, varnishes or rinses), and the presence or not of both elements in the same product. In a previous randomized clinical trial (RCT) 16 , chlorhexidine associated with fluoride in the same product achieved excellent patient acceptance and adherence in a daily mouthrinse program (0.05% NaF -0.2% CHX) and tooth staining was not reported by the users of chlorhexidine. In another study, staining was intensified after 6 months of use of 1% CHX-F toothpaste, but the program participants considered the local side effects acceptable 25 . The acceptability and tolerability of chlorhexidine and benzydamine oral rinse agents used in a protocol on oral hygiene in children receiving chemotherapy was evaluated and both agents were acceptable and welltolerated by children over the age 6 years old 6 . However, these studies used different regimes from those used in the current trial.",
