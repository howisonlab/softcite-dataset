In the lower limb, the quadriceps muscle which plays a determining role in performing the stance and other karate techniques could be injured in intensive exercise and may induce anterior knee pain in athletes. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between training volume and muscle activity of vastus medialis and vastus lateralis and its association with anterior knee pain in karate elites. Patients and Methods: Male and female athletes from national junior and cadet karate team (14 to 18 years) were invited to participate in the study at the beginning and the end of the training camps. Studies involved measurement of electromyographic muscle activity of vastus medialis and vastus lateralis in both lower extremities with surface electromyography device and assessment of movement by electrogoniometery. Muscle activity was recorded in three tests of dachi, walking up and walking down stairs. Simultaneously, anterior knee pain was evaluated using visual analogue scale and anterior knee pain scale questionnaire. Results: Eight athletes of a total number of 23 reported increased ratings of pain in their right knees. No differences in muscle activity were observed in tests of Dachi and stairs between the groups with and without pain. Comparing Dachi task pattern at the beginning and end of training camps, there was no significant difference in pattern of biomechanical movement; however, reducing the amount of muscle activity in early and late phases of tasks was observed in electromyographic assessment. Conclusions: The results showed that performing the same task after a six-week training period, less muscle activity was required in all phases in two groups of tasks, including karate-specific movement (dachi) and activities of daily living (up or down stairs).",

Among the lower limb muscles, quadriceps has a main role in implementation of karate techniques and can be susceptible to overtraining addressed by anterior knee pain. Anterior knee pain is a common debilitating complaint in athletes and one of the most important differential diagnoses is patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) (1,2).",

Several causes are involved in the pathogenesis of the syndrome, which is mainly divided into two categories: internal and external factors (1). Imbalanced forces exerted on patella by VMO and VL, improper activation time, tightness of lateral retinaculum, hypermobile patella and abnormal patellar tracking due to structural malalignment in lower extremity are the most important internal factors. Kinematic errors, increase in the duration and frequency of physical activity and training volume are external factors (1). One of the highly regarded basic pathomechanics in PFPS is delay in the activation of vastus medialis (VM) to vastus lateralis (VL) Which in theory could induce laterally pulled patella and anterior knee pain (3,4).",

It was explained to the athletes to keep the intensity of warmup including bike-riding at a comfortable level and keep their heart rate less than 100 bpm. Quadriceps and hamstring exercises consisted of hip and knee flexion and extensions with no resistance and each exercise was repeated 10 times. Each participant practiced dachi and stair-up and down tasks 2 or 3 times, intended for familiarization with the process.
