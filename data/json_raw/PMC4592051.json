A meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between LSD1 and overall survival (OS) in cancer patients. Eligible studies were identified by searching the online databases PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure up to February 2015. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to clarify the correlation between LSD1 expression and prognosis of different cancers. In total, nine studies with 1,149 cancer patients were included for final analysis. The meta-analysis suggested that LSD1 overexpression was associated with poor OS in cancer patients (HR =1.80, 95% CI: 1.39-2.34, P=0.000). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity, cancer type and HR estimate also showed that high levels of LSD1 were significantly correlated with OS. The meta-analysis showed that LSD1 overexpression may be associated with a worse prognosis in cancer patients.",

            "text": "Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) was the first characterized histone demethylase, which could specifically remove the methyl groups from mono-and dimethylated lysine (Lys)4 of histone H3 (H3K4me1/2) and Lys9 of histone H3 (H3K9me1/2). 1 LSD1 is essential for mammalian development and is involved in many biological processes, including cell type differentiation, gene activation, and gene repression. 2 A recent study indicated that LSD1 might promote cell phase transition (deficiency in LSD1 led to partial cell cycle arrest in G 2 /M) and cell proliferation, suggesting that its overexpression might promote tumorigenesis. 3 The expression of LSD1 has been associated with tumor recurrence during therapy in various cancers, further implicating LSD1 as a tumor promoter. 4,5 Many studies investigated the prognostic value of LSD1 in various cancers. Some studies found that the upregulation of LSD1 was associated with worse outcome in cancer patients. [6][7][8][9][10][11] However, some other studies showed insignificant or opposite result. [12][13][14] Therefore, the relation between LSD1 expression and patient survival across different cancers remains controversial. To overcome the limitations of the single study, this meta-analysis was carried out with the aim of evaluating the relationship between LSD1 expression and prognosis of cancer patients.",

Recently, many studies have been carried out to identify the prognostic role of LSD1 in various cancers. However, insignificant or opposite results were also observed in some studies. Since the prognostic value of LSD1 for tumor patients remains controversial, a meta-analysis was needed to explore the issue clearly.",
