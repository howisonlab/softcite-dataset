In contrast, the biology exam was taken by 111,104 students, the chemistry exam by 71,070 students, the two calculus exams by over 276,000 students, the statistics exam by 65,878 students, the U.S. History exam by 262,906 students, and the English Literature and Composition exam by 239,493 students. 2 The CHERI survey indicated that over 80 percent of principles of economics students at liberal-arts colleges in 2002-2003 were taught by tenured or tenure-track faculty, so the problem I am describing is not as pressing for these colleges (see \u0357www.ilr.cornell.edu/cheri\u0358 for details of the survey). Whether faculty involvement in research is important in generating future Ph.D.s at these institutions has been addressed by Robert J. Lemke et al. (2004)."

However, increasingly these Ph.D. degrees are granted to temporary residents of the United States; while temporary residents earned less than 20 percent of the Ph.D.s in economics in 1970 by 2002 they earned over 55 percent (Ehrenberg, 2004 fig. 2). The declining interest of American students in pursuing Ph.D. study in economics is due to a number of factors, including much better earnings opportunities in related fields, such as law and business, and the declining attractiveness of academic careers in economics that has been caused by the declining shares of faculty positions in economics departments that are full-time tenured and tenure-track ones. For example, a survey of economics department chairs undertaken by the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute (CHERI) in 2003 found that nationwide the percentage of economics department faculty members at surveyed institutions in full-time tenured and tenure-track positions fell from about 75 percent in 1982-1983 to about 58 percent in 2002-2003  (Ehrenberg, 2004 table 1).",

However, with the exception perhaps of the small number of high-school students who have taken advancedplacement classes in economics, very few entering freshman have any idea what Ph.D.s in economics do. 1 The son of two secondary-school healtheducation teachers, when I entered college, my ambition was to become a high-school mathematics teacher. But one young faculty member turned me on to economics; I wanted to be just like him, and that was my motivation for going on for a Ph.D. Many colleagues have similarly told me of a key professor who motivated them to want to become a professor. Role models are important, and if the faculty members teaching principles of economics classes are not involved in research and are not in tenured or tenure-track positions, they will be less likely to serve as role models and to motivate and encourage their students to go on for Ph.D. study. 2 Second, most top graduate programs in economics now require four semesters of calculus and linear algebra, as well as real analysis. Only by getting to undergraduate students early in their college careers can faculty members explain how students need to structure their undergraduate studies if they are to have any hope of pursuing Ph.D. study in economics.

I read through the folders of the students who have accepted offers of admissions to my college (approximately 160) and search for students with strong mathematics, statistics, or economics backgrounds. This usually means students who have taken calculus and/or either advanced-placement economics or advanced-placement statistics in high school. 4 I write several of these students prior to their arriving at Cornell and offer them positions as research assistants at CHERI. Given the large fraction of our students who must take out loans or work as part of their financial-aid packages, the take-up rate on these offers is high. 5 The current generation of entering first-year students is so computer-literate that they rapidly learn how to use spreadsheet and statistical software programs, such as EXCEL, Stat/Transfer, and STATA. I heuristically explain the econometric models we are using to them, and even if they have not had classes in statistics, they quickly understand the research that I am conducting. Within a short time, we are working together on empirical research projects. These students also mention our work to their friends, and I often link up with other bright students through these referrals.",

Thus, it is easy for me to quickly go through the application files and pick out the few top students who may prove to be interested in economics. Economists teaching in liberal-arts colleges would need to focus their attention on applicants who express interest in mathematics or social science. Economists at large universities would need to establish good relationships with admissions staff at their institutions, explain to the admissions officers the types of students that they are looking for, and ask them to make referrals of student names to them. 5 Of course one needs money to pay the students, and I am deeply indebted to the Andrew W.

The papers are group projects (students may work in groups of up to four; on average they tend to work in groups of two) to allow me time to meet with each group multiple times during the semester to check on their progress and to help guide their work. I provide each class with a list of suggested research topics. Given that my current research interest is the economics of higher education, the topics relate to that area. Table 1 provides examples of some of the topics that I share with students in the labor-economics class (in parentheses I indicate to what section of the course each topic corresponds).

The ratio of female to male salaries varies widely across institutions, as does the ratio of female to male faculty members. What factors other than differences in gender discrimination across institutions are responsible for these differences? (Gender, Race and Ethnicity in the Labor Market)"

Human-capital theory predicts that the productivity of an individual should vary over the life cycle. What do the life cycle productivity profiles actually look like for Cornell economists? Why should Cornell economists' research productivity vary across individuals at a point in time? (Human Capital Theory)"

            "text": "3) In the Yeshiva decision, the Supreme Court effectively barred collective bargaining for tenured and tenuretrack faculty members at private colleges and universities. However, state laws permit faculty at public institutions to bargain in a number of states. What determines whether faculty members at a public institution are covered by a bargaining contract, and do unionized faculty members at public highereducation institutions earn more than their otherwise comparable nonunion faculty colleagues? (Unions and the Labor Market) 4) Faculty/student ratios vary widely across colleges and universities in the United States. According to the theory of labor demand, when faculty salaries are high, one should expect to observe, ceteris paribus, lower faculty/student ratios. However, those institutions with the highest faculty salaries also tend to have the highest faculty/student ratios. Does this observation mean that the theory of labor demand is irrelevant or incorrect for nonprofit and public institutions? (Labor Demand) 5) Average faculty salary levels vary widely across academic institutions, even if one confines one's self to universities that produce Ph.D. degrees. Every decade or so, the National Research Council (NRC) conducts a study that subjectively rates the quality of Ph.D. programs in different fields. As part of the NRC's 1995 study, information on objective measures of faculty research productivity was also collected. How should average faculty salaries vary with average faculty research productivity? What other variables might be associated with differences in faculty salaries across institutions?
