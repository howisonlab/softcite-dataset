Hyperthyroidism is also associated with insulin resistance. It is not known whether hyperthyroidism has an effect on fetuin-A levels. METHODS: We measured fetuin-A levels and homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance before hyperthyroidism treatment was initiated and after euthyroidism was achieved. A total of 42 patients diagnosed with hyperthyroidism were enrolled in this study. Fetuin-A, insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fasting blood glucose, free T3 (fT3), free T4 (fT4), and thyrotropin were measured before and after euthyroidism was established. RESULTS: Basal fasting blood glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, insulin, c-peptide, homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance, fT3, fT4 and fetuin-A levels were significantly decreased after euthyroidism was achieved (Table 1).",

Therefore, fetuin-A is a mineral carrier protein and a systemic inhibitor of pathological mineralization that complements local inhibitors that act in a cell-restricted or tissue-restricted fashion (13). Fetuin-A deficiency is associated with soft tissue calcification in mice and humans. Fetuin-A is a prominent serum glycoprotein as well as a major noncollagenous component of mineralized bone in mammals. In vitro, fetuin-A can inhibit or stimulate osteogenesis, depending on its concentrations (17). Rasul et al. previously found a positive correlation between fetuin-A and bone alkaline phosphatase in type 2 diabetic males. In females, fetuin-A was significantly negatively associated with C-telopeptide levels (18). However, the researchers did not measure thyroid hormones in that study. Thyroid hormones increase bone turnover markers, and hyperthyroidism increases bone turnover. Fetuin-A may be increased in hyperthyroidism through a mechanism related to bone metabolism. Fetuin-A has been studied in several metabolic derangements; however, its role has not been studied in hyperthyroidism. Therefore, we could not compare our results with previous studies.",

They also showed that hyperthyroidism upregulated MGP mRNA 4.5 fold and reduced the calcium content of rat aortic smooth tissue by 11%. Fetuin-A also inhibits tissue calcification in a similar fashion; therefore, we hypothesize that there may be an interaction between fetuin-A synthesis and thyroid hormones because we found a positive correlation between these two parameters. To our knowledge, no experimental study in the literature has investigated the effect of thyroid hormones on the mRNA levels of fetuin-A. Hypercalcemia is a wellknown complication of hyperthyroidism, and stimulating fetuin-A synthesis may be an adaptation to prevent ectopic tissue calcification in hyperthyroidism. In a previous study of 32 thyrotoxic teenage girls, 21 (66%) showed some degree of calcification compared with 73 of 600 (12%) in the control group (22). Yamashita et al. previously observed that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23 levels (which are also related to soft tissue calcification) decreased significantly with hyperthyroidism treatment (23).

In addition to its functions as an inhibitor of tissue calcification, fetuin-A is an endogenous inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (14), and fetuin-A-knockout mice exhibit increased insulin sensitivity (15). Recent studies have associated high levels of fetuin-A with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes incidence (16), insulin resistance, hepatosteatosis (8) and metabolic syndrome (7). Li et al. previously showed that fetuin-A plays a protective role in systemic inflammation by activating high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) synthesis (20). Hyperthyroidism may also initiate an inflammatory cascade and eventually stimulate fetuin-A synthesis. Insulin resistance in hyperthyroidism may also be related to the increased levels of fetuin-A. Yavuz et al. previously showed that levothyroxine treatment of goiter patients significantly increased hsCRP at 16 weeks (21). In accordance with that study, we found a significant decrease in hsCRP levels with hyperthyroidism treatment. Fetuin-A also has strong antiinflammatory properties (13). In our study, fetuin-A levels decreased with hsCRP levels, which may also be related to the inflammation-fetuin-A interaction. In our study, insulin levels were significantly positively correlated with fetuin-A levels; furthermore, insulin levels and fetuin-A levels were decreased after euthyroidism was achieved. The relationship between fetuin-A and insulin has been studied in both clinical and experimental studies. Fetuin-A binds to insulin receptors in adipose and muscular tissue and inhibits insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity as well as insulin receptor autophosphorylation in vivo and in vitro (13). Fetuin-A has also been suggested to potentially cause insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (13).",

Fasting glucose levels were significantly positively correlated with fetuin-A levels. It was previously shown that higher fetuin-A concentrations were associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance (24). In another study, fetuin-A levels were significantly correlated with fasting plasma glucose and CRP (25). The present study is in accordance with these findings, as fetuin-A levels decreased significantly as the fasting glucose levels and insulin resistance decreased after hyperthyroidism treatment. Atherosclerosis has been shown to be enhanced in hypothyroidism (26). The anti-atherogenic effects of thyroid hormones may also be related to fetuin-A. Further clinical and experimental studies investigating the effect of hypothyroidism on fetuin-A levels may reveal its influence on atherosclerosis in hypothyroidism.",
