            "text": "Among mitogenic pathways in stellate cells, signaling by the beta platelet-derived growth factor receptor (\u03b2-PDGFR) is the most potent [1,2]. Expression of PDGF receptors is low in healthy liver, but dramatically increases in stellate cells during injury [2,3]. In both mice and humans, the PDGF signaling network is comprised of four ligands, PDGF A-D, which transduce their signals through dimeric transmembrane receptors \u03b1and \u03b2-PDGFR, which can form hetero-and homodimers [4]. Upon ligand binding, receptor dimerization provokes phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain, leading to activation of the Fas-MAPK pathway, signaling through the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway and activation of PKC family members [5].",

To create animals with constitutively activated \u03b2-PDGFR in stellate cells, \u03b2-PDGFR betaJ/+ mice, as previously described [14], (on the 129S4/B6 background) were also crossed with a transgenic GFAP-Cre line to generate \u03b2-PDGFR betaJ/+ GFAP-Cre mice. These animals harbor hepatic stellate cells with autoactivation of \u03b2-PDGFR, owing to an activating mutation knocked into the \u03b2-PDGFR locus, plus addition of a lox-stop-lox cassette between the splice acceptor and the initiating codon of the cDNA [14].",

Fig. 1B, C), but less necrosis was present at the early time point (Suppl. Fig. 2A, B). Although there was a trend in reduced inflammation in the livers of \u0394\u03b2-PDGFR mice after one week of injections (Suppl. Fig. 2B), comprehensive flow cytometry did not confirm any differences in the numbers or subsets of lymphocytes at baseline or after injury between wild type and \u0394\u03b2-PDGFR littermates (data not shown). \u03b2-PDGFR-deficiency led to significantly decreased collagen deposition after chronic hepatic injury as assessed by Sirius Red morphometry and hydroxyproline assay ( Fig. 2 A, B, C). Serum transaminase levels (AST and ALT) were increased, especially after 6 weeks ( Fig.  2D). As expected, livers with \u03b2-PDGFR deletion in stellate cells expressed less \u03b1SMA and significantly less collagen \u03b11(I) mRNAs ( Fig. 2E). In order to validate the effect of diminished \u03b2-PDGFR expression on the expansion of activated HSCs following CCl 4 treatment, we quantified the \u03b1SMA-positive tissue area in both groups (Suppl. Fig. 3A). Both after a short-term, and more strikingly, after long-term injury, mice of the \u0394\u03b2-PDGFR group had reduced expansion of activated HSCs versus controls. This finding was further validated using whole liver lysates of livers after 6 weeks of CCl 4 treatment (Suppl. Fig.  3B). Here, the decreased expression of \u03b2-PDGFR resulted in a diminished expression of \u03b1SMA. As an additional marker for HSCs and to measure the expansion of HSCs during injury within the liver, desmin staining was performed on tissue sections following 1 week of CCl 4 treatment (Suppl. Fig. 4). In these mice, there was a significant decrease in desminpositive tissue quantification in \u0394\u03b2-PDGFR mice versus controls.",

Isolated cells were stained for CD45 and BrdU and then analyzed by flow cytometry. UV autofluorescence was used to distinguish stellate cells from non-fluorescent cells, while the expression of CD45 was used to discriminate CD45 \u2212 stellate cells from other non-parenchymal cells (Suppl.

The signature is assumed to reflect signals of molecular deregulation from multiple cell types in the cirrhotic tissue microenvironment that drive disease progression. We hypothesized that activation of \u03b2-PDGFR signaling in stellate cells contributes at least a part of the prognostic gene signature. Using this dataset, we examined whether the stellate cell-derived \u03b2-PDGFR or \u0394\u03b2-PDGFR gene signature was present in the human cirrhosis cohort and determined its prognostic association. To do so, we performed Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to evaluate induction of the 186-gene signature in isolated stellate cells from our \u03b2-PDGFR-wild-type and knockout mice. Of note, we observed a statistically significant enrichment of poor-prognosis-and good-prognosiscorrelated signature genes in the wild-type and knockout stellate cells, respectively (false discovery rate <0.25) ( Fig. 4C a, b). Genes up-regulated in the \u03b2-PDGFR knockout cells (i.e., genes suppressed by \u03b2-PDGFR pathway activation) ( Supplementary Table 2), were associated with a good prognosis (Fig. 4C a). Likewise, genes up-regulated by \u03b2-PDGFR activation showed an association with a high overall risk of mortality in HCV cirrhotic patients (Fig. 4C b), suggesting that the pathway activation itself is partially linked to the risk of liver disease and fibrosis progression. Genes involved in inflammation and cell survival such as NFKB2, IER3, IFI30, and BCL2 contributed to the enrichment within the poor prognosis signature (Table 1). However, genes previously implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis such as EGF [24] were not involved in the enrichment, suggesting that \u03b2-PDGFR signaling in stellate cells is not directly involved in the process of hepatocarcinogenesis. We verified the expression levels of the top five differentially regulated genes of \u03b2-PDGFR-wild-type and knockout mice as selected by DNA microarray using quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 4D). These data provide evidence for a strong correlation between microarray data as well as PCR from hepatic stellate cells isolated from mice of both groups. For Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the 186-gene signature within hepatic stellate cells of \u03b2-PDGFR control compared to knockout mice, see Suppl. Table 2. Collectively, these results suggest that activation of \u03b2-PDGFR signaling in stellate cells has downstream consequences that drive disease progression and poor prognosis of human cirrhosis, but not through increased risk of HCC development.",

Deleting \u03b2-PDGFR on hepatic stellate cells impairs their fibrogenic potential in vivo, leading to decreased expression of \u03b1SMA and collagen \u03b11(I), and reducing their proliferation upon injury. Although previous studies have not directly linked \u03b2-PDGFR to collagen expression, here we demonstrate that the lack of \u03b2-PDGFR on primary hepatic stellate cells leads to decreased expression of collagen I after treatment with PDGF-B. Our data establish that \u03b2-PDGFR activation increases fibrosis accumulation at least in part through increased stellate cell numbers based on BrdU incorporation in stellate cells in vivo and subsequent FACS analysis. We also emphasize that while specificity of human GFAP-Cre expression has been questioned [25], both this study and separate reports [12,13] underscore its utility to drive stellate cell cre expression. Moreover, it has been shown that \u03b2-PDGFR is only expressed in activated hepatic stellate cells and some vascular endothelial cells in liver thereby minimizing potential hepatic off-target effects of the GFAP-Cre expression since only stellate cells will be affected by deletion of \u03b2-PDGFR. One major issue is that differences in the recombination of different floxed alleles or Cre reporters cannot be ruled out completely.",

For example, recent studies strongly implicate EGFR signaling and clinical outcomes in human HCC [24,26,27], yet in contrast to a previous report [28] our findings do not establish a similar link for \u03b2-PDGFR signaling, despite its clear contribution to fibrosis. EGF was not among the 14 genes that lead to an enrichment of the phenotype for poor prognosis in GSEA downstream of \u03b2-PDGFR signaling (Table 1, Suppl. Table 2). Although sorafenib, which is the only approved molecular therapy for HCC, targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including \u03b2-PDGFR, our data suggest that the antineoplastic benefit of sorafenib may not be due to its impact on \u03b2-PDGFR signaling alone, but rather on other RTK pathways, especially Ras/Raf kinase, HGF and VEGF signaling [29]. We also emphasize that expert histologic assessment failed to confirm the presence of true HCCs but rather only preneoplastic, dysplastic nodules, undermining the potential value of this model in generating true HCCs, in contrast to what has been previously proposed [28].",
