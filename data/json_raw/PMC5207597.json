Sixty-eight eyes of 35 patients with RP and 65 eyes of 35 normal controls were analyzed in the study. The average length of EZ was 911.1 \u00b1 208.8 mm in RP patients, which was shortened with the progression of the disease on the OCT images. The average ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness (GCIPLT) was 54.7 \u00b1 18.9 mm in RP patients, while in normal controls it was 85.6 \u00b1 6.8 mm. The GCIPLT in all quarters became significantly thinner along with outer retinal thinning. There was a significantly positive correlation between BCVA and EZ (r = \u00c00.7622, P < 0.001) and GCIPLT (r = \u00c00.452, P < 0.001). Therefore, we assess the retinal layer changes from a new perspective in RP patients, which suggests that EZ and GCIPLT obtained by GCA combined with OCT imaging are the direct and valid indicators to diagnosis and predict the pathological process of RP. Abbreviations: BCVA = best corrected visual acuity, EZ = ellipsoid zone, ERG = electroretinography, ELM = extend limiting membrane, GCIPLT = ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness, GCA = ganglion cell analysis, GCL = ganglion cell layer, IPL = inner plexiform layer, OCT = optical coherence tomography, ORT = outer retinal thickness, RP = retinitis pigmentosa, RNFL = retinal nerve fiber layer, RPE = retinal pigment epithelium, RGC = retinal ganglion cell.",

            "text": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a hereditary degenerative disease of the retina. [1,2] As a cause of visual impairment, the prevalence of RP is about 1 in 4000, [3,4] which is characterized by slowly progressive, concentric constriction of the visual field. [2,5] The earliest histopathological changes in all forms of RP involve shortening of the photoreceptor segments, so there are a number of studies about outer retinal changes, [5][6][7][8][9] while relatively fewer articles about inner retinal thickness. [10,11] In addition, the results showed that the inner retinal layers were preserved or even thickening compared to the outer retinal layers, which was associated with neuronal-glial remodeling, especially in early stage of RP patients. [12] In addition, the morphometry study showed that the ganglion cell number was not statistically different in the various stages of RP. [13] Therefore, currently proposed strategies to treat RP are based on the assumption that the inner retinal cells are intact. [2] However, there were also articles reported less ganglion cells in RP patients than in normal controls. [14,15] Besides, the inner retinal layers including the inner limiting membrane, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and inner nuclear layer measured by manual methods were widely different in previous studies, [11,12,15,16] and RNFL thickness is dramatically different in individuals. [17] So, the general conclusion that the inner retinal cells are intact need to be reassessed, especially by the modern devices.",

Sixty-five eyes of 35 patients (11 female, 24 male; age range 26-78 years; median age 51.8 years) without retinal disease served as normal controls. The study was conducted at Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital between December 2012 and April 2015. The study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Data collection and analysis were approved by the hospital ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. RP patients were diagnosed based on clinical history, funduscopic appearance, visual field testing, and full-field electroretinogram records. All participants underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, including measurement of BCVA, noncontact tonometry, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, color fundus photography, full-field electroretinography (ERG), central visual field, and spectral-domain OCT. BCVA, expressed as the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (log MAR), finger count, hand movement, light perception, and no light perception were designated as 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. All participants followed the selection criteria: ERG was markedly reduced or had no rod response, and the area of central visual field was lost severely. Although some eyes were with good BCVA, the central visual field defect was severe (mean deviation <\u00c020 dB by Octopus Field Analyzer (Haag-Streit, Koeniz, Switzerland)), and the retinal atrophy of the eyes was severely shown by the fundus images.",

Cross-section images of 6 mm horizontal and vertical scans through the central fovea were obtained. A macular cube 512 \u00c2 128 scan was obtained by Cirrus HD-OCT to obtain the central fovea thicknesses (CFT) and GCIPLT data. The macula thickness and the outer rings, bounded by 3 and 6 mm concentric circles, were constructed using the automated software algorithm. Central subfield thickness was defined as the average thickness in the central 1 mm subfield centered on the fovea. Average macular thickness, foveal thickness, outer macular (superior, nasal, inferior, and temporal) thicknesses, and macular volume were obtained for each eye. The GCA algorithm was incorporated into the newer Cirrus OCT software version 6.5 with the annulus of inner vertical and horizontal diameters of 1 and 1.2 mm, respectively, and outer vertical and horizontal diameters of 4 and 4.8 mm, respectively. As reported, [27] the outer ring size includes the area where the GCL is thickest in a healthy eye. The GCA algorithm identifies the outer boundaries of RNFL and IPL, between which is the GCIPL layer. GCIPLT will be analyzed according to 8 parameters-average, minimum, and 6 sectors (superonasal, superior, superotemporal, inferotemporal, inferior, and inferonasal)-by the GCA algorithm embedded in Cirrus OCT. Grayscale images were used for a more precise identification and measurement of the EZ. Length was measured in the horizontal and vertical scans, and an average value was obtained. Outer retinal thickness (ORT) was defined as the region from the outer plexiform layer to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer/ Bruch complex, consisting of the outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, extend limiting membrane (ELM), myoid zone, EZ, interdigitation zone, and RPE/Bruch complex. ORT was measured 1 mm from the fovea in the horizontal and vertical scans, and an average value was obtained.",

The RP patients with thicker CFT had better BCVA, so there was a positive correlation between CFT and BCVA, which was consistent with the previous studies. [15,28] The earliest histopathological changes in all forms of RP involve shortening of the photoreceptor segments, but there are fewer articles about inner retinal thickness. The previous study reported that the inner nuclear, inner plexiform, and retinal  GCLs were relatively intact. [11] In addition, the clinical and morphometry studies showed the similar results that inner retinal layers were preserved in the RP groups. [10,13] What is more, even inner retinal thickening was detected, which was related with neuronal-glial remodeling response to photoreceptor loss in RP patients, [29,30] but the patients in later stage with decreased inner retinal thickness was also proved. [12] In addition, the histopathologic studies reported that RP had significantly fewer ganglion cells than those of the control group, [14] and the thickness of GCL combined IPL was significantly thinner in RP by OCT. [15] In addition, the new articles showed that ganglion cells decreased because of inherited photoreceptor degeneration in animal studies, [31,32] which was related with deficit of the retrograde axonal transport lead by inherited photoreceptor degeneration. [33] Therefore, in the present study, we used GCA as a new method for assessing the structural changes of GCIPL, which is related to the photoreceptor degeneration in RP patients.",

In the present study, we assessed the correlation The results showed that peripapillary RNFL thicknesses did not differ significantly between the RP and control groups, but in the temporal and nasal quadrants, the RP group had a significantly thicker RNFL, while RNFL thinning was seen in the superior and inferior areas.

            "text": "Medicine between GCIPLT and ORT, and the results showed that GCIPLT thinning was significantly related to the decreased ORT as well as the macular retinal thickness. We further assessed the correlation between GCIPLT and BCVA, RP patients with thicker GCIPLT had better BCVA, but the correlation was moderate. The reasons might be that some eyes with poor visual acuity still preserved the thickness of the RGC, and the present OCT could not distinguish the transition between the GCL and the IPL. So a larger study cohort and new OCT with a more precise segmentation of the retinal layers is needed in the future study. To summarize, the inner retina might be relative preserved in the early stage of RP; the thickness was decreased with the progression of the disease, especially in the late stage and advanced ones. RNFL is the axon originating from the ganglion cells, so we measured the thickness to see whether the papillary RNFL thinning occurred along with the degeneration of ganglion cell. In the previous studies, the changes in RNFL thickness are inconsistent, including thickening, thinning, or relative unifor-mity, measured by time domain OCT or spectral domain OCT. [34][35][36][37][38] In addition, the relevant studies have indicated that RNFL thickening was most common in the temporal area, and RNFL thinning was found in the nasal and inferior regions. [35,37] However, results in our study showed that the average papillary RNFL thickness did not change significantly compared with the normal controls. But there existed a spatial preference of RNFL thickening in the temporal and nasal directions and RNFL thinning in the inferior and superior areas. These findings suggest that RNFL thickness changed in the RP eyes along with the degeneration of ganglion cell. But the reasons accounting for RNFL thickening or thinning in different areas need to be investigated in further researches.",

            "text": "Although the mechanism of RNFL degeneration is different from glaucoma, the orders of RNFL thinning are similar in the sequence of RNFL thinning. [39] A recent study reported that compromised axonal transport would lead to RGC loss and decreased RNFL thickness during the developing process of RP, Figure 6. Relationship between best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central fovea thicknesses (CFT), ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness (GCIPLT), and ellipsoid zone (EZ). CFT and GCIPLT were graded from 1 to 3 according to statistical percentile (33.3% and 66.6%). The appearance of the EZ in the optical coherence tomography (OCT) images was graded from 1 to 3: Grade 1, shortened EZ greater than 1 mm; Grade 2, shortened EZ less than 1 mm; and Grade 3, EZ not visible. Mean visual acuity (log MAR units) as a function of the grade of the OCT parameters. (A1-C1) The difference among the 3 groups was statistically significant (P < 0.005). Retinitis pigmentosa patients with thicker CFT and GCIPLT and longer EZ had better BCVA (P < 0.001). (A2-C2) The correlations among BCVA and CFT, GCIPLT, and EZ were evaluated using a linear regression model. The results showed significant positive correlations among BCVA and CFT (r = \u00c00.5933, P < 0.001), GCIPLT (r = \u00c00.452, P < 0.001), and EZ (r = \u00c00.7622, P < 0.001); EZ at the fovea demonstrated a stronger relationship with BCVA. and the maximum transneuronal damage occurred mainly in the inferonasal quadrant, [35] which was consistent with the results in our study. Apart from RNFL thinning, the reasons for RNFL thickening have been studied, it has been reported that with the progress of RNFL degeneration, the proliferative glial cell displacing the atrophic nerve fiber and edematous changes of the residual RNFL were attributed to a thickened RNFL. [34] Hood et al [11] speculated that a purely mechanical factor compelling the thickening RNFL partially filled the quadrants where the receptors degenerated. As a result, RNFL thickening is found in the area where GCIPL thinning is greatest in RP patients. So while the regions of GCIPL thinning are corresponded to the areas of RNFL defects in glaucoma, [40] it is almost the opposite in RP patients. The results suggest that it should be prudent to make optimal use of RNFL thickness for predicting the status of RGC in patients with RP. Refer to the discrepancies among the different studies, it might stem from differences in OCT devices and the discordant stages of RP in the study populations.",

Our further results showed that postreceptor retinal layer (GCIPLT) became significantly thinner along with the retinal photoreceptor EZ degeneration in all quarter, which was correlated with BCVA in RP patients. So, we assess retinal layer changes with the advent of the GCA software combined with the modern OCT devices from a new perspective and to quantify the changes both in outer and inner retinal layers, which are very useful for diagnosis, staging, and prognosis of RP.",
