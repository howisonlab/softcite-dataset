            "text": "M astectomy undoubtedly has a traumatic effect on the lives of women diagnosed with breast cancer. 1-3 This perception may impact their social, personal, and sexual relationships. 4 Half of all women who undergo a mastectomy perceive a negative self-image and experience negative changes in their sexuality. 5 Breast reconstructive surgery can reduce the psychological trauma associated with loss of the breast. 6 The demand for reconstructive procedures of various types has accelerated in recent years, which, coupled with enhanced patient expectations, has fostered the development of oncoplastic and reconstructive techniques in breast surgery. Surgeons throughout the world have described a wide array of reconstructive techniques, including the use of expanders, implants, and tissue flaps. Autologous reconstructions have generally been considered by most plastic surgeons to be superior to implants because they adhere to the reconstructive axiom of replacing like with like. 7 Clinical outcomes research in plastic surgery now not only examines morbidity and mortality but also assesses patient perceptions regarding results and improvement in quality of life. 8,9 The patient experience is important in breast surgery as it affects the patient psychosocially, her physical functioning, and the aesthetic result. 10 As such, key indicators such as patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life are becoming important outcomes for evaluating the success of cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery."

The choice of the reconstructive procedure for each patient is based on an evaluation of quality of tissue in area after mastectomy, body mass index, size of contralateral breast, and an excess of soft tissue in the lower abdomen. Patients with tight skin after radiotherapy and with higher body mass index are more prone to receive free TRAM flap breast reconstruction. The study population consisted of 2 groups of women, the patients who underwent mastectomy and delayed breast reconstruction with implants and patients who underwent mastectomy and delayed breast reconstruction with the free TRAM flap."

Autologous reconstruction has the benefit of replacing like with like. Despite requiring lengthier procedures and a longer recovery, autologous tissue-based reconstruction has the potential to recreate a soft, naturally ptotic breast shape that is ideal for matching an unaffected contralateral breast. 18 The goal of reconstructive breast surgery is no longer to create a breast mound; instead, it aims to create a breast with a natural shape, volume, contour, and symmetry. The use of autologous tissues allows for reconstruction of a breast, which looks and feels more like a natural breast. Patient expectations after mastectomy and reconstruction have increased, and reconstructive plastic surgeons should continue to strive for excellence to satisfy them.",

The authors noted that patients who underwent TRAM flap, compared with patients who underwent expander/implant reconstruction, showed greater long-term esthetic satisfaction. The satisfaction reduction in patients who underwent breast reconstruction using an expander/implant could be related to the high incidence of complications and reoperations required for this technique. 20 Women who undergo reconstruction using silicone gel implants have up to a 28% 21,22 risk of developing grade III or IV Baker capsular contracture and a 30% risk of having to remove or replace the prosthesis, resulting in an overall reoperation rate of 45% to 50%.  Although implant-based breast reconstruction remains the most common method utilized to reconstruct a breast after mastectomy for cancer, autologous tissue reconstruction is generally regarded the gold standard in breast reconstruction. 23 In any case, implant reconstruction has advanced through the years with better devices and improved surgical techniques. This is why the spectrum of patients suitable for implant-based breast reconstruction goes beyond the traditional concept of slim to moderately built women with modest breast size and minimal ptosis. In addition, the development of acellular dermal matrices and fat transfer techniques will further evolve for patients suitable for implant-based techniques.",
