            "text": "We have used whole genome paired-end Illumina sequence data to identify tandem duplications in 20 isofemale lines of Drosophila yakuba and 20 isofemale lines of D. simulans and performed genome wide validation with PacBio long molecule sequencing. We identify 1,415 tandem duplications that are segregating in D. yakuba as well as 975 duplications in D. simulans, indicating greater variation in D. yakuba. Additionally, we observe high rates of secondary deletions at duplicated sites, with 8% of duplicated sites in D. simulans and 17% of sites in D. yakuba modified with deletions. These secondary deletions are consistent with the action of the large loop mismatch repair system acting to remove polymorphic tandem duplication, resulting in rapid dynamics of gain and loss in duplicated alleles and a richer substrate of genetic novelty than has been previously reported. Most duplications are present in only single strains, suggesting that deleterious impacts are common. Drosophila simulans shows larger numbers of whole gene duplications in comparison to larger proportions of gene fragments in D. yakuba. Drosophila simulans displays an excess of highfrequency variants on the X chromosome, consistent with adaptive evolution through duplications on the D. simulans X or demographic forces driving duplicates to high frequency. We identify 78 chimeric genes in D. yakuba and 38 chimeric genes in D. simulans, as well as 143 cases of recruited noncoding sequence in D. yakuba and 96 in D. simulans, in agreement with rates of chimeric gene origination in D. melanogaster. Together, these results suggest that tandem duplications often result in complex variation beyond whole gene duplications that offers a rich substrate of standing variation that is likely to contribute both to detrimental phenotypes and disease, as well as to adaptive evolutionary change.",

Additionally, duplicate sequences are commonly found in mammalian stem cells (Liang et al. 2008), cancer cell lines (Inaki and Liu 2012), and are associated with autoimmune disease, HIV susceptibility, Crohn's disease, asthma, allergies, and autism (Ionita-Laza et al. 2009). Distinguishing the propensity with which gene duplications serve as causative disease factors as opposed to a source of favorable variation depends heavily on accurate ascertainment of their occurance and frequencies in the population.",

            "text": "In the Drosophila, there is substantial variation in the number and types of duplicate genes that are present in the sequenced reference genomes (Hahn et al. 2007) though the extent to which selection might drive rapid fixation of duplicate genes or whether mutation rates differ across species remains uncertain. Furthermore, these surveys of single strains from each species may not be representative of the variation present in populations and offer only limited opportunities to study their role in adaptation. The advent of Illumina sequencing has made population genomics of complex mutations in nonmodel Drosophila readily tractable. Paired-end Illumina sequencing offers the opportunity to survey copy number variation using definitive sequencebased comparisons that are free from complications related to sole use of coverage or hybridization intensities. Through the identification of paired-end reads that map in abnormal orientations, we can identify a high-confidence data set describing tandem duplications in sample populations (Tuzun et al. 2005;Korbel et al. 2007;Cridland and Thornton 2010).",

In D. melanogaster, the X chromosome contains greater repetitive content (Mackay et al. 2012), displays different gene density (Adams et al. 2000), has potentially smaller population sizes (Wright 1931;Andolfatto 2001), lower levels of background selection (Charlesworth 2012), and an excess of genes involved in female-specific expression (Ranz et al. 2003) in comparison to the autosomes. Furthermore, the X chromosome is hemizygous in males, exposing recessive mutations to the full effects of selection more often than comparable loci on the autosomes (Charlesworth et al. 1987). Hence, the incidence of duplications on the X and the types of genes affected may differ from the autosomes, and thereby produce different impacts on phenotypic evolution.",

Genomes are sequenced to high coverage of 50-150\u00c2 for a total of 42 complete genomes (supplementary tables S1-S5, Supplementary Material online, see Materials and Methods). We have used mapping orientation of paired-end reads to identify recently derived, segregating duplications in these samples <25 kb in length that are supported by three or more divergently oriented read pairs (see Materials and Methods, supplementary text S1, tables S6 and S7, Supplementary Material online). We limit analysis to regions of the genome, which can be assayed with coverage depth of three or more reads across all strains, corresponding to the detection limit for tandem duplicates. We identify 1,415 segregating tandem duplications in D. yakuba and 975 segregating tandem duplications in D. simulans ( fig. 1), including large numbers of gene duplications (table 1) with  a low false positive rate (supplementary table S8, Supplementary Material online). We assess the numbers and types of gene duplications, differences in duplication rates and sizes across chromosomes, and describe evidence of secondary modification through deletions, which will influence the extent to which these variants can serve as a source of genetic novelty.",

In fact, the number of variants identified is only weakly correlated with coverage per strain ( fig. 4) a product of sequencing to the saturation point of coverage (supplementary table  S9, Supplementary Material online). Downsampling reads from D. yakuba CY17C, which was sequenced to 151\u00c2, we find that the portion of the genome covered with three or more reads (the detection limit of our assay) plateaus at roughly 45\u00c2 (supplementary table S9, Supplementary Material online) though lower coverage data used in previous studies (Alkan et al. 2009;Sudmant et al. 2010;Mills et al. 2011;Zichner et al. 2013) will be far from this plateau.

The rate of PCR confirmation in D. simulans is not significantly different from previous studies of copy number variants, but we observe significant differences between D. yakuba and all other confirmation rates (supplementary table S10, Supplementary Material online). In view of this disparity, combined with difficulties of PCR primer design for variants whose precise structures are unknown, we generated PacBio long molecule sequencing data for four strains of D. yakuba in order to more reliably estimate the false positive rate (supplementary table S11, Supplementary Material online). PacBio long molecule sequencing has recently been used to validate targeted duplications in human genome data (Huddleston et al. 2014). We extend this approach to genome wide identification and validation of tandem duplications, and have generated PacBio reads for four different sample strains of D. yakuba. Across these four strains, we observe confirmation of 661 out of 688 mutations, for a maximum false positive rate of 3.9% (supplementary table S8, Supplementary Material online), though some variants may be unconfirmed due to low clone coverage in a region. Hence, the duplicates identified with pairedend reads in high coverage genomic sequence data are extremely accurate and comparable to or better than previous methods or attempts to identify and validate duplicates using lower coverage genomic sequences or microarrays (Alkan et al. 2009;Sudmant et al. 2010;Cardoso-Moreira et al. 2011;Mills et al. 2011;Zichner et al. 2013). Split read mapping with short Illumina reads performed poorly in comparison and failed to confirm 88.3% of variants, and breakpoint assembly was possible for <60% of variants in spite of high rates of confirmation with PacBio (see supplementary text S1, Supplementary Material online).

The large loop mismatch repair system can facilitate deletions of duplicated sequence to modify duplicated sequence as long as variants are polymorphic. The presence of unpaired duplicated DNA during meiosis or mitosis would commonly invoke the action of the large loop mismatch repair system, which if resolved imprecisely, could result in the construct observed ( fig. 7). Deletions lying within a duplication have a median size of 3.6 kb in D. yakuba and 1.8 kb in D. simulans. Such large deletions are well outside the norm for genome wide large deletions in mutation accumulation lines of D. melanogaster, which show an average 409 bp and maximum of 2.6 kb (Schrider et al. 2013). Deletions of this size however are consistent with the size of excised fragments in large loop mismatch repair of several kilobases (Kearney et al. 2001). Deletion during nonhomologous end joining or homology-mediated replication slippage might produce deletions as well though it is unclear whether mutation rates are naturally high enough to operate in short time frames. Thus, we would expect modification of duplicated alleles to be extremely common, especially in deletion-biased Drosophila.",

A genome wide BLASTn comparison shows that direct repeats are not overrepresented on the D. simulans X chromosome and cannot explain the observed association (supplementary table S26, Supplementary Material online).

If the span of standing variation in populations is limited, the dynamics, genomic content, and variability of standing variation in populations are likely to play a defining role in evolutionary outcomes. The observed span of tandem duplications across strains is limited, with 2.574% of the assayable genome of the X and four major autosomes in D. yakuba and 1.837% of the assayable genome of the X and four major autosomes in D. simulans. Yet, the variation that is observed portrays a dynamic picture of gains and losses with evidence that duplications can induce subsequent deletions through large loop mismatch repair, suggesting that regions that are duplicated create genomic instability. The resulting expansion and contraction of genomic sequences will contribute to greater variability in these limited regions than has been suggested to date, offering wider variation upon which selection can act. Up to 17% of duplications in D. yakuba and 8% of duplications in D. simulans show long-spanning reads in one or more strains, indicative of complex changes such as subsequent deletion, insertion of foreign sequence, or incomplete or short-range dispersed duplication ( fig. 5). These results are consistent with complex breakpoints previously observed in D. melanogaster (Cridland and Thornton 2010). Moreover, coverage changes for certain variants are consistent with duplication followed by subsequent deletion in one or both copies (supplementary fig. S4, Supplementary Material  online). Hence, the current pool of genetic diversity will in fact be far greater than simple interpretation of divergently oriented reads or split read mapping might indicate. The majority of such changes has one or more strains with no Rogers et al. . doi:10.1093/molbev/msu124 MBE signs of modification, suggesting that these variants are primarily duplications followed by deletions.",

Deletion of excess unpaired DNA for polymorphic duplicates during large loop mismatch repair, excision of TEs, replication slippage, and deletion during nonhomologous end joining all offer common mechanisms that are likely to remove portions of duplicated alleles. Among these mechanisms, the large loop mismatch repair system specifically targets newly added DNA and is likely to be a driving force in the rapid modification of duplicated alleles. In the ideal case, precise excision would simply return the construct to singleton state resulting in a rapid cycle of mutations and reversions. However, when such removal is imprecise, these subsequent deletions are likely to modify duplicated sequences leaving incompletely duplicated segments. The average distance spanned by these putative deletions is over 2 kb, well above the mean for deletions observed in mutation accumulation lines of D. melanogaster (Schrider et al. 2013), but in agreement with the amount of DNA that can be efficiently removed by large loop mismatch repair (Kearney et al. 2001).",

Thus, the substrate that is present for selection and adaptation will be far richer than a simple duplication or single copy, but rather can take on these complex forms of modified variants that remain largely unexplored in terms of their molecular and evolutionary impacts. Thus, although the observed amount of variation is limited to only a fraction of the genome, the level of variation at these duplicated sites portrays an exceptionally dynamic flux of duplications and deletions at these sites that will result in changes in the content and organization of the genome and therefore is expected to have a strong influence on evolutionary outcomes.",

Drosophila yakuba will likely display not only a greater tendency toward pathogenic phenotypes associated with tandem duplicates (Hu and Worton 1992;Emerson et al. 2008) but also a greater source of standing variation that can be useful in adaptation and the development of novel traits (Conant and Wolfe 2008). Estimates of N e in D. yakuba are higher than in D. simulans. We would thus expect greater instances of detrimental duplicates to be higher in D. simulans than in D. yakuba, but neutral mutations will collect more quickly across populations of D. yakuba due to high N e .

Chimeric genes are associated with human cancers, and the molecular changes associated with chimera formation may contribute to their role as causative factors in human disease. The molecular changes that are facilitated by chimera formation (Rogers and Hartl 2012) likely contribute to their detrimental impacts on organisms and their role in disease as well as their potential for adaptation. We observe large numbers of chimeric genes that are identified as single variants in the population. Thus, chimeras may play the dual role of key players in adaptation to novel environments and as agents of detrimental phenotypic changes. The large amounts of standing variation observed may therefore contribute to disease alleles in populations, and proper identification is likely to be important for studies in human health.",

Hence, although paired-end Illumina read mapping is highly accurate, it cannot ascertain breakpoints to single base pair resolution in the majority of cases. Moreover, requiring breakpoint assembly to identify duplications will produce a strong ascertainment bias against up to 50% of all variants. This bias is more severe for small variants, even in Drosophila, which have compact genomes and few repeats in comparison to plants or vertebrates. Thus, short high-throughput Illumina reads orientation mapping offers an accurate but incomplete picture of variation present in the population, which can now be clarified with low coverage long read sequencing data.",

However, where accurate, arrays may reflect the span of duplicated segments more accurately than divergent reads alone as they would accurately reflect deletion after duplication. However, the presence of complex events such as subsequent deletions may, if not properly identified and accounted for, overestimate of the mutation rate of duplications and underestimate their frequency in the population by claiming a modified variant as an independent duplication. Here, the directional nature and spatial relationships of read pair mapping show advantages: Divergently oriented reads distinguish duplication, whereas long spanning properly oriented reads can indicate a deletion with greater clarity and properly identify subsequent modification. Identifying putative deletions in duplicated sequences requires a tight distribution of insert sizes during library preparation (supplementary table S5, Supplementary Material online) but offers a far more complete picture of variation that is segregating in populations and more accurate estimation of variant frequencies that is well worth the effort.",

Within-genome surveys of nonsynonymous mutations in the D. simulans reference (Andolfatto et al. 2011) and large numbers of highfrequency derived variants among nonsynonymous sites and untranslated regions in D. simulans (Haddrill et al. 2008) indicate widespread selective sweeps acting on the X chromosome. Similarly, we identify an excess of variants identified at high frequency on the D. simulans X, consistent with previous work using microarrays (Cardoso-Moreira et al. 2011). In D. melanogaster, the X chromosome contains greater repetitive content (Mackay et al. 2012), displays different gene density (Adams et al. 2000), has potentially smaller population sizes (Wright 1931;Andolfatto 2001), lower levels of background selection (Charlesworth 2012), and an excess of genes involved in female-specific expression (Ranz et al. 2003) in comparison to the autosomes. Moreover, X chromosomes are subject to selfish genetic elements and often play a role in speciation (Presgraves 2008). Thus, the X chromosome may be exceptionally subject to widespread selection, and the role of tandem duplicates as responders to selective pressures deserves future exploration.",

More recent studies have focused solely on changes in Illumina or 454 coverage analogous to changes in hybridization intensity (Sudmant et al. 2010). We have used coverage changes in combination with divergently oriented reads to identify variants using comparisons to a resequenced reference and quantile normalized coverage data to correct for stochastic coverage changes, repetitive content, GC bias, and low complexity sequence, resulting in robust variant calls. Furthermore, the common practice of retaining only variants that are present in multiple samples or at particular genotype frequencies (Conrad et al. 2010), detected by multiple independent methods (Alkan et al. 2009;Mills et al. 2011;Zichner et al. 2013), or that are larger than several kilobases (Alkan et al. 2009;Xie and Tammi 2009;Sudmant et al. 2010) can lead to severe ascertainment bias both with respect to the types of variants that are present, the estimation of their prevalence within populations and contribution to disease phenotypes, and the evolutionary impacts of duplicated sequences.",

            "text": "With more recent improvements in Illumina sequencing technology, we have been able to sequence strains individually to 50\u00c2 or greater coverage. The use of paired-end reads in extremely high-coverage data provides clear advantages over previous work using roughly 3.6-25\u00c2 with subsets sequenced to 30-42\u00c2 (Sudmant et al. 2010;Mills et al. 2011;Zichner et al. 2013), or 16\u00c2 (Alkan et al. 2009). The high-coverage data presented here cover the majority of the assayable genome and we exclude only a few percent of variant calls due to low coverage across strains (supplementary table S9, Supplementary Material online). Thus, we are able to identify hundreds of events that have three or more supporting divergent read pairs that might be missed at lower coverage (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online). We have additionally filtered sequences to exclude ancestral Rogers et al. . doi:10.1093/molbev/msu124 MBE duplications, similarly to previous work in humans (Mills et al. 2011) allowing for identification of derived mutations. The result is a high-confidence data set for recently derived tandem duplications in data that effectively surveys the majority of the assayable genome. This high coverage is essential in ensuring valid results from the sole use of paired-end read orientation. However, the types of duplications that can be detected are highly dependent on sequencing library insert size. For breakpoints with large amounts of repetitive sequence, reads separated by 300 bp may not be sufficient to overcome difficulties of read mapping. Additionally, the minimum duplication size is also limited by insert size. Capturing these types of constructs using paired-end reads, especially in organisms with large amounts of repetitive content, including nested TEs, will require a more diverse range of library insert sizes, a factor that is likely to be important for surveys of larger, more repetitive genomes.",

Divergently oriented reads are additionally reliable to detect duplications in regions where distributions of coverage are too irregular to allow for automated detection of duplicates. We observe a high 96.1% confirmation rate of variants among four sample strains of D. yakuba using PacBio reads up to 24 kb in length, suggesting that paired-end reads in high coverage genomic sequencing will grossly outperform previous methods which show high false positive and false negative rates. Moreover, the use of the newly annotated D. simulans genome (Hu et al. 2013) based on a single isofemale line will result in improved accuracy in comparison to previous studies in D. simulans (Cardoso-Moreira et al. 2011). The general principles of the paired-end approach should be broadly applicable and similar methods already have been used to identify chromosomal inversions in natural populations (Corbett-Detig et al. 2012). PacBio reads can confirm structural variants with high rates of success, even given low coverage and nucleotide high error rates (Huddleston et al. 2014) and we have extended this approach to our genome wide survey. However, the ambiguity of split read mapping in the face of repetitive elements can still complicate de novo duplicate discovery using split read mapping of long reads. Furthermore, for the present, generating high-coverage genomic sequencing equivalent to that of our paired-end Illumina data is not cost-effective. However, this technology and similar long read approaches are likely to offer advantages in confirming or discovering structural variants such as tandem duplications, as well as de novo assembly, that is, worth future exploration.",

The resulting portrait of hundreds to thousands of variants, including large numbers of complex breakpoints, modifying deletions, cases of recruited noncoding sequence, and dozens of chimeric genes per species reveals a rich substrate of segregating variation across populations. We show that although the span of duplications across the genome is quite limited duplicates can induce secondary mutations and result in dynamic changes, resulting in greater variation across mutated sites that offers more abundant variation for use in adaptation than has been previously portrayed. The ways in which this variation influences adaptive evolution and produces molecular changes will clarify the extent to which mutational profiles define evolutionary outcomes and the ways in which molecular changes associated with tandem duplications serve as causative factors in disease.",

Alignments from regions within 1 kb of putative tandem duplications called using short read data (divergent read orientation plus an increase in coverage) were extracted from the bam files using samtools 0.1.18 . Reads falling within these regions were then pulled and realigned to the reference using a BLASTn (Altschul et al. 1990) with low complexity filters turned off (\u00c0F F) at an E value cutoff of 0.1 to allow for short alignments given the high error rate of PacBio sequencing. Alignment using BLASTn proved important because it revealed cases where the bam files resulting from blasr alignments failed to record secondary hits for a read, especially in cases where alignments are on the order of hundreds of base pairs. Here, confirmation benefits from long sequences which can anchor reads uniquely to a region, producing greater confidence in split read alignments. Variants were considered confirmed whether two segments of a single PacBio subread which do not overlap by more than 20% align to overlapping sections of the reference (supplementary fig. S5B, Supplementary Material online) or whether a single read aligns in split formation with the downstream end of the read aligning to an upstream region of the reference (supplementary fig. S5A and C-E, Supplementary Material online). An event was considered not confirmed whether there were no long reads showing any of the alignment patterns in supplementary figure S5, Supplementary Material online, within 1 kb of the variant. Variants were considered definite false positives if clearly contradicted by at least one read spanning the entire putatively duplicated region as defined by Illumina read mapping and adjacent reference.

In D. simulans, 65 genes were involved in multiple independent duplications that have distinct breakpoints. Overrepresented GO categories include immune response to bacteria, chorion development and oogenesis, chemosensory perception, and organic cation membrane transport (supplementary table S14, Supplementary Material online). In D. yakuba among 72 genes duplicated independently, chorion development and oogenesis, cell signaling, immune response, sensory processing, and development are overrepresented (supplementary table S14, Supplementary Material online). There are 25 high-frequency variants found at a sample frequency of 17 20 or greater in D. simulans, including lipases and endopeptidases expressed in male accessory glands and several genes involved in immune response to microbes (supplementary table S15, Supplementary Material online). One gene arose independently and has reached high frequency twice in D. simulans.
