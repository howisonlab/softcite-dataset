CDC25 (cell division cycle 25) phosphatases function as activators of CDK (cyclindependent kinase)\u2212cyclin complexes to regulate progression through the CDC. We have recently identified a pool of CDC25B at the centrosome of interphase cells that plays a role in regulating centrosome numbers. Results. In the present study, we demonstrate that CDC25B forms a close association with Ctn (centrin) proteins at the centrosome. This interaction involves both N-and C-terminal regions of CDC25B and requires CDC25B binding to its CDK\u2212cyclin substrates. However, the interaction is not dependent on the enzyme activity of CDC25B. Although CDC25B appears to bind indirectly to Ctn2, this association is pertinent to CDC25B localization at the centrosome. We further demonstrate that CDC25B plays a role in maintaining the overall integrity of the centrosome, by regulating the centrosome levels of multiple centrosome proteins, including that of Ctn2. Conclusions. Our results therefore suggest that CDC25B associates with a Ctn2-containing multiprotein complex in the cytoplasm, which targets it to the centrosome, where it plays a role in maintaining the centrosome levels of Ctn2 and a number of other centrosome components.",

In the dividing cell, the centrosome takes on a more dynamic role as it transforms into the bipolar mitotic spindle required for accurate segregation of duplicated chromosomes between the two daughter cells (Doxsey, 2001). For this, the G 1 phase centrosome, consisting of a mother and daughter centriole pair surrounded by a dense network of proteins, known as the PCM (pericentriolar material) must duplicate itself once before mitotic entry. This process begins in the early S phase and usually occurs in a semi-conservative manner, in that a new centriole (or procentriole) forms perpendicular to each existing mother or daughter centriole. It then elongates by recruiting essential components from the surrounding PCM (Doxsey, 2001;Azimzadeh and Bornens, 2007).",

Further, cells depleted of CDC25B and consequently arrested in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle have a reduced number of Ctn (centrin)-positive centrioles within each centrosome (Boutros and Ducommun, 2008). This loss of centrioles and/or Ctn protein following CDC25B depletion is not the result of premature centrosome separation (Boutros and Ducommun, 2008). Thus, it is most likely caused either by a defect in centriole duplication or a defect in the incorporation of Ctn itself into replicating centrioles.",

            "text": "Ctns are small calcium-binding proteins, and although more than 90% of the protein is partitioned between the cytoplasm and nucleus in human cells, the remaining pool is concentrated at the centrosome (Baron et al., 1994;Paoletti et al., 1996). Ctns are localized within multiple regions of the centrosome, including the distal lumen of the centriole core structure, the interconnecting bridge between the mother and daughter centriole pair, and in the PCM (Paoletti et al., 1996;Salisbury, 2007). In addition to making up an important structural component of the centrosome, Ctns have been reported to be involved in either centriole assembly or centriole segregation, depending on the organism in question. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Ctn homologue CDC31p has been found to be essential for initiating spindle pole body duplication (Baum et al., 1986;Paoletti et al., 2003), whereas two Ctn orthologues found in Paramecium were reported to be involved in centriole positioning (Ruiz et al., 2005). In mammalian cells, determining the role(s) of Ctns in centriole biogenesis has proven to be more complicated. Four Ctn isoforms are known to exist, which are differentially expressed. Ctn1 and Ctn4 appear to be restricted to terminally differentiate ciliated cells, whereas Ctn2 and Ctn3 are expressed in all somatic cells (Salisbury, 2007). The role of Ctn2 in centriole duplication in human cells remains unclear. Although siRNA (small interfering RNA) depletion of Ctn2 was first reported to cause a failure in centriole duplication in HeLa cells (Salisbury et al., 2002), these results were challenged by the finding that centrioles can continue to duplicate normally in the absence of both Ctn2 and Ctn3 in PLK4-overexpressing U2OS cells (Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007). However, other evidence exists that suggests Ctn2 can contribute to centrosome duplication, through interactions with CaM (calmodulin) and CP110 (Tsang et al., 2006), hSfi1 (Kilmartin, 2003;Martinez-Sanz et al., 2006) and hPOC5 (Azimzadeh et al., 2009). Thus, it appears that the involvement of Ctns in the centrosome assembly pathway in mammalian cells is most likely exerted through their association(s) with other proteins and protein complexes.",

We found that CDC25B can associate with multiple Ctn isoforms, expressed either endogenously or exogenously in HeLa and U2OS cells, although this association appears to occur indirectly. Nonetheless, we found that Ctn2 depletion results in a loss of CDC25B from the centrosome. Similarly, CDC25B depletion causes a loss of centrosomal Ctn2, in addition to \u03b3 -tubulin, Nedd1, and the pericentriolar matrix protein PCM1. Together, our results suggest that CDC25B forms a complex with Ctn2, which is necessary for its localization to the centrosome, where it is involved in regulating the local levels of multiple centrosome proteins.",

In live cells, however, in which cytoplasmic CDC25B protein cannot be pre-extracted, the detection of the centrosomal pool of CDC25B against a strong cytoplasmic background has proven technically challenging, and CDC25B was almost never discernible in cells transiently expressing fluorescently tagged CDC25B. To overcome this, we attempted to transiently express low levels of an mCherry-tagged CDC25B in a HeLa cell line that stably expresses human GFP (green fluorescent protein)-Ctn1 (HeLa-Ctn1, generously given by Dr Michel Bornens, Curie Institute, Paris, France), as a centrosome marker. Surprisingly, we observed that the visibility of CDC25B at the centrosome was enhanced in cells overexpressing Ctn (Figure 1A). In fact, when transfected into HeLa-Ctn1 cells, mCherry-CDC25B was readily detectable at the centrosome(s) in approx. 25% of interphase cells, in comparison with less than 1% when expressed in parental HeLa cells [ Figure 1A; WT (wild-type) and results not shown].",

These CDC25B mutants were transiently expressed as mCherry fusion proteins in HeLa-Ctn1 cells and assessed for their abilities to localize to centrosomes in live cells. As summarized in Figure 1, full-length CDC25B forms localized to the centrosome, even when either the critical catalytic residue Cys 487 or substrate-binding residue Arg 506 were mutated. Furthermore, both Nter (regulatory region only) and Cter (catalytic domain only) mutants were capable of localizing to the centrosome (Figure 1). However, when the catalytic site Cys 487 residue was mutated (Cter C487S), the Cter domain alone was no longer sufficient for CDC25B localization to the centrosome. As the levels of CDC25B expressed showed significant cell-to-cell variations for all mutants examined, we were unable to determine with any certainty whether any of the various CDC25B mutants examined preferentially localize to the centrosome in comparison with the WT protein.",

To detect the centrosomal pool of CDC25B, immunofluorescence analyses were performed using an antibody that specifically detects CDC25B phosphorylated on Ser 230 (CDC25B-S230P), which is mediated by Chk1 throughout the cell cycle (Schmitt et al., 2006;Boutros et al., 2007b), as this is currently the only reliable antibody available for the reproducible detection of endogenous CDC25B at the centrosome in all cells. We observed a significant loss in the centrosomal pool of CDC25B in approx. 50% of HeLa ( Figure 2) and 40% of U2OS (Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.biolcell.org/ boc/103/boc1030055add.htm) cells, in which Ctn2 was efficiently depleted by 48 h siRNA treatment ( Figure 2C).

We therefore depleted CDC25B from HeLa and U2OS cells by siRNA, and examined the centrosomal levels of Ctn2. We observed that CDC25B-depleted cells displayed a significant loss of Ctn2 from the centrosome in approx. 30\u221240% of both HeLa ( Figure 5) and U2OS (Supplementary Figure S6 at http://www. biolcell.org/boc/103/boc1030055add.htm) cells, although no effect on total Ctn2 protein levels were detected by Western-blot analyses ( Figure 2C). These results are consistent with our previous observation that CDC25B depletion in HeLa cells results in a significant proportion of cells in the G 2 phase displaying only one detectable (or barely detectable) Ctn-positive centriole, rather than two (Boutros and Ducommun, 2008).",

CDC25B siRNA and subsequent immunofluorescence analyses revealed that depletion of CDC25B caused a visible reduction in, or a dispersal of, centrosomally localized \u03b3 -tubulin [in agreement with our previous finding (Boutros et al., 2007b)], in addition to Nedd1, ninein and PCM1 proteins, but had no effect on pericentrin ( Figure 6).

In recent years, a small subset of centrosome proteins have been identified as being essential for centriole duplication, including PLK4 (Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2005;Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007), hSAS-6 (Rodrigues- Martins et al., 2007aMartins et al., , 2007b, CPAP (Rodrigues-Martins et al., 2007b), CP110 (Chen et al., 2002;Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007) and Cep135 (Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007), in addition to CDK2 (Hinchcliffe et al., 1999;Meraldi et al., 1999) and \u03b3 -tubulin (Ruiz et al., 1999;Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007). However, many other proteins that are present at the centrosome also contribute to centrosome biogenesis. One such protein is Ctn, a member of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins that is recruited to the site of centriole assembly from the very early S phase (Klink and Wolniak, 2001;Koblenz et al., 2003;Stemm-Wolf et al., 2005;Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007), but whose exact role in centriole assembly in mammalian cells remains unclear. A number of Ctn2-binding partners have been identified to date which together suggest that it functions primarily through modifying the activities of its binding partners.",

            "text": "At the centrosome, Ctn2 has been shown to associate with its highly related EF-hand family member CaM, which simultaneously associates with CP110, in a high-molecular-mass multiprotein complex, involved in centriole duplication and cytokinesis (Chen et al., 2002;Tsang et al., 2006). Two other known direct-binding partners for human Ctn2 are involved in centrosome duplication. The human homologue of the Sfi1 protein, identified in the yeast S. cerevisiae, is an essential component of centrosome duplication and the G 2 \u2212M transition (Kilmartin, 2003;Martinez-Sanz et al., 2006). The recently identified centriole protein hPOC5, which contains Ctnbinding repeats similar to those found in Sfi1p and is recruited to the distal ends of centrioles in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle, to regulate centriole elongation (Azimzadeh et al., 2009). In the nucleus, Ctn2 interacts with the XPC (xeroderma pigmentosa group C gene product), which is involved in the early steps of NER (nucleotide excision repair) of DNA lesions (Araki et al., 2001;Nishi et al., 2005), and enhances the XPC-stabilizing activity of a second NER complex protein HR23B via an indirect association (Araki et al., 2001). The nuclear pool of Ctn2 is modified by the SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) machinery to regulate its nuclear localization and its interaction with XPC (Klein and Nigg, 2009). Nuclear Ctn2 has also been shown to play a role in mRNA export, through its interaction with the nucleoporin Nup107\u2212160 complex (Resendes et al., 2008). Thus, in a fashion similar to CaM, with which it shares at least 50% amino acid sequence homology (Friedberg, 2006), Ctn2 appears to exert its effect on centrosome duplication and other cellular processes through interactions with other proteins.",

This appears to be due to a common association with an as yet unidentified protein or protein complex. The formation of this CDC25B/ Ctn-containing complex controls centrosomal concentrations of both CDC25B and Ctn2, albeit through different mechanisms. CDC25B appears to associate with a Ctn-containing complex for targeting to the centrosome, where it is involved in regulating centrosome numbers and microtubule nucleation (Boutros et al., 2007b). Notably, we had observed that CDC25B depletion disrupts the microtubule network by reducing the level of \u03b3 -tubulin at the centrosome (Boutros et al., 2007b). We now observe a loss of other centrosomal components following CDC25B depletion, including Ctn2 itself, and a more dispersed organization of PCM1, which is required for microtubule anchoring (Dammermann and Merdes, 2002). Together, these results suggest that the overall integrity of the centrosome is compromised in the absence of CDC25B and that the associated abnormalities in the microtubule network are probably caused by the combined loss or dispersal of multiple centrosome proteins required for anchoring and assembling tubulin polymers.",

Moreover, it has been suggested that the PCM promotes the formation of daughter centrioles by concentrating \u03b3 -tubulin around the mother centriole (Dammermann et al., 2004). It is therefore tempting to postulate that overexpression of CDC25B, which is common in many human cancers (Boutros et al., 2007a), contributes to a local increase in centrosomal levels of Ctn, \u03b3 -tubulin, and perhaps other PCM components, to promote the assembly of excess centrioles. Indeed, CDC25B overexpression alone is sufficient to cause centrosome overduplication during the S phase (Boutros et al., 2007b).",

The R506L substrate-binding mutant of CDC25B failed to interact with Ctn at the centrosome in FRET analyses, whereas the catalytically inactive C487S form of CDC25B could interact with Ctn1. This interaction was also true for GST\u2212CDC25B C487S and endogenous Ctn2 protein from both HeLa and U2OS cells, in pull-down analyses. Our results suggest that once at the centrosome, CDC25B must also be capable of binding to its CDK-cyclin substrates to remain in close proximity to Ctn. One possibility is that CDC25B controls the centrosomal levels of Ctn through a CDK-cyclin-mediated phosphorylation of Ctn, which protects the protein from recognition by the proteasome machinery. Indeed, Ctn2 has been shown in vitro to be a CDK substrate (Lutz et al., 2001). This model would be analogous to CDK2cyclin E phosphorylation of centrosomal Mps1 (Kasbek et al., 2007).",

In this set-up the femtosecond-pulsed laser light is scanned into the left camera port of the microscope through the FLIM optics. The fluorescence emission is directed back into the detection unit through the same camera port and a short-pass filter (\u03bb < 750 nm). The FLIM unit was composed of two galvano mirrors, scanning along the x and y axes, a relay lens to focus the laser beam on to the dichroic (with a cut-off at 750 nm), and the streak camera (Streakscope C4334, Hamamatsu Photonics) coupled to a fast and high-sensitivity CCD (charge-coupled device) camera (model C8800-53C, Hamamatsu Photonics). The streak camera consisted of a photocathode surface, a sweep electrode to deflect the photoelectrons according to their arrival time, an MCP-PMT (microchannel plate-photomultiplier tube) to amplify photoelectrons and a phosphor screen to detect the amplified photoelectrons. The images on the phosphor screen were readout by the CCD camera (for a comprehensive description of the streak-FLIM system, see Krishnan et al., 2003). The images were acquired with a lateral resolution of 0.246 nm. For each y position in the object, an (x,t) image was produced by recording the fluorescence decay during a given time interval (full timescale of 10 ns with a temporal resolution of 60 ps). Scanning the entire optical image in the y-direction results in a stack of (x,t) images from which fluorescence decays at each (x,y) position can be extracted. The intensity image of the object plane was obtained by integrating fluorescence intensities over time. The CCD camera gain was set to 0 to minimize electronic noise. The MCP-PMT gain (6\u22128) and the exposure time of the CCD (100 ms) were adjusted to avoid overexposure of the CCD (max value of 4096 grey levels). Frame accumulation (up to 20 frames) was used to increase the signal/noise ratio. The total acquisition time per image ranged from 60 to 80 s (imaging field of 15 \u03bcm).",

Proteins were separated on SDS/12.5\u221215% PAGE gels and transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes. Western-blot analyses were performed with antibodies against phosphorylated CDC25B (CDC25B-S230P; Schmitt et al., 2006), total CDC25B (C-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Ctn2 (N-17) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, \u03b1-tubulin (B-5-1-2) and \u03b3 -tubulin (GTU-88) from Sigma\u2212Aldrich, and GFP from Roche. Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Zymed. ",
