They also cause damage to the pulmonary microvasculature and impact blood flow from heart to lungs [6, 7]. Although current treatments may prolong and improve quality of life of patients, the long-term prognosis for PAH remains poor with survival of 2 to 3 years since the time of diagnosis [1]. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1, Alprostadil) is a compound with vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-aggregatory, and antiproliferative properties [8-10]. PGE1 has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men and patent ductus arteriosus in newborns. PEG1 has been investigated as treatment for various cardiopulmonary disorders, especially for pulmonary arterial hypertension [11-14]. However, the clinical",

            "text": "Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is a progressive chronic disease with a high mortality rate [1]. PAH has a complex disease mechanism. Its cardinal signs include an elevation of pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, and arteriolar wall remodeling [2]. Increased pul monary vascular resistance and over-proliferation of utility of PGE1 has been limited due to its chemical instability and extremely hydrophobic nature which results in low drug absorption and poor bioavailability. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the use of PGE1 in cardiac and lung transplantation. Using target organ infusion protocols can circumvent the extensive first pass metabolism of PGE1 by the lungs and prevent the decreased bioavailability and clinical efficacy of PGE1 infused systemically [15][16][17][18][19].",

            "text": "Endothelins are potent vasoconstricting peptides that have proliferative and pro-inflammatory effects. Isoform ET-1 is a well-established mediator of pulmonary vascular homeostasis [24]. Among other subtypes of PAH, higher levels of ET-1 are predictive of severity and mortality. ERAs can improve clinical and hemodynamic parameters of PAH. Therefore, ERAs are mainstays of PAH therapy [25][26][27]. The following is our hypotheses about the mechanisms of how PGE1 decreases medial wall thickening. PGE1 has vasodilatory, antiinflammatory, anti-aggregatory, and anti-proliferative effects through decreasing the expression of ET-1 in lung tissues. However, when PGE1 is intravenously administered, it is rapidly eliminated by the lungs. The half-life of intravenous PGE1 can be as short as 42 seconds. Therefore, the clearance of intravenous PGE1 is closely related to respiratory function and pulmonary blood flow. In animal models of acute or chronic pulmonary hypertension, inhaled PGE1 can increase ventricular contractility and reduce pulmonary arterial pressure [28]. Inhalation of a single 25 \u00b5g dose of aerosolized iloprost, a prostanoid analogue, is associated with enhanced cardiac index and reduced mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance [29]. In previous studies, inhalation of 300 \u00b5g/day of PGE1 for 10 days following surgery is associated with reduced pulmonary arterial pressure, similar to the effect of intravenous PGE1 infusion [28]. Cortical hyperostosis of long bones is also reversible in neonates receiving PGE1 greater than 120 hours [30]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of continuous intravenous PGE1 on hemodynamics and long-term outcomes of rats with MCT-induced PAH. In the present study, we treated PAH rats with PGE1. We then performed hematoxylin and eosin staining, Masson Trichrome staining, immunohistochemical staining, and western blot analysis in order to investigate changes of ET-1 immunoreactivity in the cardiometer of these rats. A significant increase in pulmonary arterial pressure following MCT injection was accompanied by RV hypertrophy and increased lung and heart fibrosis when compared to the control group (Figs. 2, 3). In the RV of rats with PAH, PGE1 treatment decreased the development of RV hypertrophy and normalized the expression of collagen content (Fig. 3). Additionally, in rats with PAH, SPAP of the heart was decreased by PGE1 treatment (Table 1). There results suggest that PGE1 could decrease pulmonary vessel contraction and remodeling, leading to improvement in apoptosis and inhibition of fibrosis in PAH rats. These findings support our hypothesis that chronic PGE1 administration can improve PAH.  PGE1, a naturally occurring eicosanoid, is synthesized from 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid dihomo-gammalinolenic acid (DGLA) via cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 pathways [31,32]. PGE1 is a member of series-1 prostaglandin class. It can produce a number of physiological effects. It is primarily known for its anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects. It has been reported that PEG1 can inhibit platelet aggregation, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and collagenase activity [33][34][35]. In pulmonary circulation, PGE1 is synthesized primarily by cells of the vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells. Following intravenous administration, PGE1 is distributed and metabolized with an estimated half-life of 5-10 minutes [36]. Lungs are the primary sites for the metabolism of PGE1. They can metabolize as much as 80% of systemically absorbed PGE1 in a single pass [36]. Metabolism in pulmonary vascular bed is an oxygen-dependent process [37]. Prostaglandins including PGE1 are normally paracrine lipidic mediators. They can interact with a distinct family of G-protein coupled prostanoids receptors composed of 8 subtypes (EP1-4, IP, FP, TP, and DP) [38]. Of these eight subtypes, EP2, EP4, DP, and IP can induce smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilatory effects [39]. This mechanism is different from cardiac striated muscles where the troponin complex is responsible for the regulation of muscle contractions. PGE1 is also considered as a potential treatment option for PAH because of its high pulmonary clearance (70%-90%) and pulmonary-selective vasodilating effect [40]. However, intravenous administration of PGE1 has side-effects such as systemic hypotension and low cardiac output, similar to those produced by other short-acting prostacyclin analogues [40]. Recently, Della Rocca et al. [11] have documented the efficacy of inhaled PGE1 in improving pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygenation in a clinical trial enrolling 18 patients undergoing lung transplantation. They reported that PGE1 administered at a low dose produced a reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure and improved oxygenation without impairing systemic hemodynamics [11]. Thus, there is compelling evidence showing that PGE1 is a pulmonary-selective vasodilator that can be used as an alternative to current therapy for PAH. However, no study has attempted to develop a long acting PGE1. PGE1 might be used to treat cardiovascular disease. It has potential to induce vessel relaxation and inhibit excessive proliferation of vascular cells.",
