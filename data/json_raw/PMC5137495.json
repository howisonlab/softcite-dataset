            "text": "Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) occurs at extraordinarily high frequency, but no effective treatment for this disorder has been established. Goshajinkigan (GJG), a traditional Japanese medicine known as Kampo, is known to reduce OIPN in both basic and clinical studies. However, its molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of GJG against OIPN and the therapeutic benefits of combining GJG with bushi, a herbal medicine derived from the processed Aconiti tuber. Oxaliplatin (4 mg/kg) was injected into mice twice a week for up to 4 and 3 weeks, respectively. OIPN was assessed using pain behavioral tests, such as those testing cold hypersensitivity, thermal hyperalgesia, and mechanical allodynia, as well as a reduction of the current perception threshold (CPT). GJG (0.3 or 1 g/kg) and bushi (0.1 or 0.3 g/kg) were orally administered 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Behavioral analysis was performed 24 h after the final dose. Oxaliplatin induced cold hypersensitivity and mechanical allodynia but not thermal hyperalgesia and reduced CPT of Ad-and Ab-fibers but not C-fibers. All these effects were counteracted by GJG. Bushi, an ingredient of GJG that shows analgesic effect, reduced oxaliplatin-induced cold hypersensitivity but had no effect on oxaliplatininduced mechanical allodynia. However, bushi significantly accentuated the effects of GJG when coadministered with GJG. GJG reduces OIPN by counteracting the sensitization of Ad-and Ab-fibers and shows analgesic effects against cold hypersensitivity and mechanical allodynia. These effects are potentiated by bushi. The combination of GJG with bushi has high potential for preventing OIPN.",

[1][2][3] Oxaliplatin causes neuropathy as an adverse effect with an extraordinarily high frequency, which is viewed with suspicion because it is the most common dose-limiting factor for oxaliplatin therapy. [4][5][6] The acute phase of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) is characterized by cold hypersensitivity, which is followed by the chronic phase of OIPN characterized by sensory ataxia, numbness, and sensations of pain, such as mechanical allodynia. These symptoms of OIPN worsen with continued oxaliplatin therapy; therefore, the discontinuation of oxaliplatin therapy is frequently required, leading to a decrease in therapeutic effects. However, a limited number of OIPN treatments, such as calcium gluconate and magnesium sulfate, 7 analgesic drugs (pregabalin and opioids) 8,9 and antioxidants (silibinin and polyphenols, such as quercetin), 10,11 have been investigated in basic and clinical research, and they have not achieved satisfactory outcomes in clinical practice.",

We found that oxaliplatin caused cold hypersensitivity in the early period ( Fig. 1A and B), which was followed by mechanical allodynia (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, it did not cause thermal hyperalgesia (Fig. 1C). These characteristics of neuropathy in mice were similar to those seen in the clinical symptoms in human. 4,6 We also investigated the effects of oxaliplatin on the sensitivity of individual peripheral sensory neurons using a neurometer test 22 and found that oxaliplatin causes a significant increase in the responsiveness of myelinated peripheral sensory neurons, including Ad-and Abfibers, which sense fast pain and tactile pressure, respectively. However, oxaliplatin did not affect C-fibers (Fig. 2). The time course of sensitivity of these A-fibers was roughly the same as that of mechanical allodynia. Unlike nociceptive pain, mechanical allodynia starts with a sense of innocuous tactile stimuli by non-nociceptive neurons, such as Ab-fibers, which somehow transmit tactile stimuli as pain in pathological conditions. The sensitization of Ab-fibers, therefore, would be the most likely event responsible for oxaliplatin-induced mechanical allodynia. GJG significantly inhibited mechanical allodynia ( Fig. 1D and  F) and the sensitization of Ad-and Ab-fibers ( Fig. 2C-F). In addition, Kono et al reported a morphological analysis demonstrated that oxaliplatin causes the atrophy of axons containing myelinated nerve fibers but not non-myelinated nerve fibers in the sciatic nerves in rats and that this effect was ameliorated by GJG. 17 The simplest interpretation of these findings is that an increase in the sensitivity of either Ad-or Ab-fibers or both is involved in the induction of mechanical allodynia and that GJG, acting on these sensory fibers, inhibits their sensitization.",

As for cold Figure 3. Bushi potentiates the ameliorating effects of goshajinkigan against oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy. Goshajinkigan (GJG) (0.3 g/kg) and/or bushi (0.1 or 0.3 g/kg) were administered orally, immediately after the injection of oxaliplatin, 5 times a week for 3 weeks. The acetone test was performed on day 3 ((A)and C). The von Frey test was performed on day 18 ((B) and D). \u00c3\u00c3 P < 0.01 compared with the control group; # P < 0.05, ## P < 0.01 compared with the oxaliplatin-treated group. $ P < 0.05, $$ P < 0.01 compared with the oxaliplatin C GJG group.

Thus, the simplest interpretation of our present results is that in our model or administration schedule, oxaliplatin mainly acted on and sensitized TRPM8 in myelinated A-fibers, thereby leading to cold hypersensitivity. Alternatively, oxaliplatin may upregulate TRPA1 or molecules other than TRPA1 in A-fibers or may affect TRPM8 in A-fibers. Although the mechanisms underlying oxaliplatin-induced cold hypersensitivity are still unknown, we demonstrated that GJG significantly inhibited cold hypersensitivity (Fig. 1A, B and E) and the sensitization of Ad-and Ab-fibers ( Fig. 2C-F). Considering the present results that oxaliplatin sensitized only myelinated A-fibers, where TRPA1 is not present, 23 GJG may mainly act on and inhibit TRPM8 in A-fibers and, thereby, inhibit cold hypersensitivities. However, further studies are needed to clarify this.",

            "text": "Another important finding is that bushi, one of the ingredients of GJG, significantly enhances the therapeutic effects of GJG, thus proposing a combination therapy using GJG and bushi. Bushi is widely used in Japan for several types of chronic and persistent pains, including neuropathic pain. It has been shown to potentiate the analgesic effects of some kinds of Kampo medicine. 21 Bushi, at a dose of 0.3 g/kg, improved cold allodynia (Fig. 3A) and significantly potentiated the effects of GJG against it (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that bushi may play a pivotal role in the ameliorating effects of GJG against cold allodynia and that a combination of GJG and bushi may contribute to potentiating the action against it. However, a further study to examine the effect of GJG eliminating bushi on cold allodynia is needed to clarify whether bushi is the active ingredient of GJG against it. Interestingly, neither GJG alone nor bushi alone at a dose of 0.3 g/kg inhibited the oxaliplatininduced mechanical allodynia (Fig. 3B), but when co-administered, they significantly inhibited mechanical allodynia (Fig. 3D). Although the mechanisms underlying mechanical allodynia are not simple, allodynia includes both peripheral and central neuronal phenomena. As for central mechanisms, the activation of spinal microglia 26 or astrocytes 20 is known to be highly related to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. It has become apparent that glial cells, especially microglia and astrocytes, in the spinal cord play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of neuropathy induced by anti-cancer agents, such as paclitaxel, vincristine, and oxaliplatin. [27][28][29] Furthermore, we found that bushi is a strong inhibitor of astrocytic activation and revealed its anti-allodynic effect caused by inhibiting spinal astrocytes in the Seltzer mouse model. 20 However, in the present study, the activation of glial cells (changes in the localization and morphology of microglia and astrocytes) was not observed in the spinal dorsal horn of oxaliplatin-treated mice on days 5 and 19 using immunohistochemical analyses (data not shown). The reason for the failure of bushi alone to inhibit the oxaliplatin-induced mechanical allodynia is either because spinal astrocytes, the target cells of bushi, were not activated in our OIPN model or because the symptom types of OIPN are not exactly the same as those of neuropathic pain. Bushi has a variety of other pharmacological activities, including a thermal effect, an increase in blood flow, and the inhibition of platelet aggregation, [30][31][32] thus, we do not exclude the possibility that bushi may potentiate the therapeutic effects of GJG via these pharmacological activities.",

Furthermore, we found that bushi potentiated the ameliorating effects of GJG against OIPN. Thus, the combination of GJG with bushi can improve the symptoms of patients who do not respond adequately to monotherapy with either GJG or bushi. These findings are expected to improve treatments and support future clinical trials associated with oxaliplatin therapy.",
