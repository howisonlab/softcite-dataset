Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the longitudinal relationship of nonalcoholic fatty liver on the development of abdominal obesity. The study participants were composed of 11,212 Korean men without abdominal obesity. They were followed up from 2005 to 2010 to be monitored for the development of abdominal obesity according to their degree of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (normal, mild, and moderate to severe). Cox-proportional hazard model was used to calculate the hazard ratios for abdominal obesity according to the degree of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. While the average incidence was 15.5%, the incidence of abdominal obesity increased according to the degree of non-alcoholic fatty liver (normal: 11.6%, mild: 25.2%, moderate to severe: 41.0%, P < 0.001). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for abdominal obesity independently increased proportionally to the degree of NAFLD (mild [1.07; 0.94-1.23], moderate to severe [1.58; 1.11-2.26], P for trend < 0.001). The risk of abdominal obesity increased proportionally to the degree of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This finding guarantees further studies to reveal the incidental relationship of abdominal obesity with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.",

            "text": "Obesity is a significant medical issue threatening public health not only in Western countries but also in Asian countries. As of 2008, more than 10% of the world population, about 500 million adults, was obese (1), which was expected to explosively increase in the future (2). Especially, abdominal obesity has more serious clinical implication. It has been reported that abdominal obesity was more significant risk factors for various diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome than general obesity (3)(4)(5). In addition, medical problems related to abdominal obesity are rapidly raising medical cost, which is burdening social financial stability (6). Accordingly, these situations are increasing the necessity for academic activity or business to prevent abdominal obesity.",

Since a lot of researches have been actually performed to investigate the association between NAFLD and abdominal obesity, deep clinical and mechanical relationships were revealed between 2 factors. However, most of studies have mainly focused on the effect of abdominal obesity for NAFLD, and studies for the reverse relationship were very rare. Nonetheless, considering the significant function of liver in processing biochemical reaction of major metabolic factors such as fat, glucose, and insulin, it is worthy to research into the effect of NAFLD on the development of abdominal obesity. Thus, we conducted this study to investigate the risk of abdominal obesity according to the degree of NAFLD.",

Moderate (N = 133, 1.19%) and severe NAFLD (N = 1, 0.01%) was combined into moderate to severe NAFLD category for analyses, owing to the small number of severe NAFLD. The distributions of continuous variables were evaluated, and log transformations were used in the analysis as required. For incident abdominal obesity cases, the time of abdominal obesity occurrence was assumed to be the midpoint between the visit at which abdominal obesity was first diagnosed and the baseline visit (2005). The person years were calculated as the sum of follow-up times from the baseline until an assumed time of abdominal obesity development or until the final examination of each individual. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for incident abdominal obesity comparing the mild and moderate to severe NAFLD categories vs. the normal group. The data were adjusted, first for age alone, then for the multiple covariates. In the multivariate models, we included variables that might confound the relationship between the NAFLD and abdominal obesity, which include: age, baseline WC, total cholesterol, log(hsCRP), HOMA-IR, eGFR, cur-rent smoking status, regular exercise, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The change level of WC was calculated by following formula: WC on censoring time -baseline WC. The average change of WC was compared among 3 groups (normal, mild and moderate to severe NAFLD groups) by one-way ANOVA and \u03c7 2 -test.

Nonetheless, there was scarce information about the effect of NAFLD on the development of abdominal obesity. In this study, incidence and risk of abdominal obesity increased proportionally to the degree of NAFLD, even after adjusting for multiple covariates. Therefore, these findings could be the significant clinical background for the previous studies demonstrating the higher prevalence of adult disease under NAFLD. In short, as NAFLD patients are vulnerable to abdominal obesity, risk for diseases related to abdominal obesity may also increase in NAFLD patients.",

Mean baseline WC of every group, even if less than 90 cm, cut-off value of central obesity, was in proportion to the degree of NAFLD. Baseline mean value of HOMA-IR, indicator of insulin resistance, also increased with the same tendency of WC. These findings agree well with the previous reports showing metabolic factors associated with the development and progression of NAFLD (16)(17)(18). In addition, mean baseline metabolic factors associated with NAFLD were more unfavorable in more progressed NAFLD group. Therefore, it was undoubted that various deleterious metabolic conditions interactively contributed to the development of NAFLD. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, there was no study showing that NAFLD induced by these factors increased the risk for abdominal obesity in proportion to the degree of NAFLD. Accordingly, our study findings imply that NAFLD developed by some deleterious conditions can induce abdominal obesity through its independent action.",

As well known, insulin resistance plays a core role in the development and progression of NAFLD, and hyperinsulinemia is a definite clinical manifestation of insulin resistance. Previous studies showed that elevated insulin level could cause obesity. Johnson et al reported that hyperinsulinemia drove a diet-induced obesity independently of brain insulin production (19), and clinical studies showed that long term insulin therapy could induce weight gain (20,21).",

Therefore, there might have been possibility of discrepancy between ultrasonographic finding and real NAFLD. Nonetheless, it was inappropriate to perform invasive test in a population based epidemiological study (23). Additionally, US is a widely used and acceptable modality for diagnosis of NAFLD with high sensitivity (82%-94%) and specificity (66%-95%) (24)(25)(26). Particularly, all examinations were carried out by experienced radiologists using widely established methods and criteria.
