Materials and Methods: The occlusal radiographs taken from 50 UCLP patients were surveyed retrospectively. The images were categorized as: 50 images in group 0 (before bone grafting), 33 images in group 1 (one month after bone grafting), 24 images in group 2 (2-4 months after bone grafting), 15 images in group 3 (5-7 months after bone grafting), and 21 images in group 4 (8 or more months after bone grafting). Each image was grouped as either \"non-cleft side\" or \"cleft side\". The CAD system was used five times for each side to calculate the pixel area based on the mathematical morphology. Significant differences were found using a Wilcoxon signed ranks test or paired samples t test. Results: The pixel area showed a significant difference between the \"non-cleft side\" and \"cleft side\" in group 0 (404.27\u00b1103.72/117.73\u00b192.25; p= =0.00), group 1 (434.29\u00b186.70/388.31\u00b1109.51; p= =0.01), and group 4 (430.98 \u00b198.11/366.71\u00b1154.59; p= =0.02). No significant differences were found in group 2 (423.57\u00b198.12/383.47\u00b1 135.88; p= =0.06) or group 3 (433.02\u00b1116.07/384.16\u00b1146.55; p= =0.19). Conclusion: Based on the design of this study, alveolar bone grafting was similar to normal bone within 2-7 months postoperatively. (Imaging Sci Dent 2012; 42 : 225-9",

            "text": "Treating patients with cleft lip and palate is commonly done in a team setting and usually spans from birth until adolescence. The alveolar cleft sometimes highlights the problem of the penetration of food into the nasal cavity. As a result of this, the lateral incisor and canine cannot erupt into normal position since there is no bone support in the cleft area. These patients are always treated by alveolar bone grafting, which corresponds to a chronological age of a 9-to 12-year-old before the mid-facial growth has been completed. The alveolar bone grafting provides periodontal support for the teeth with bone augmentation to support the lip and an alar base that also closes the oronasal fistulae.",

The exclusion criteria for the radiographs were images that had poor diagnostic quality including scratches on the radiograph or too much distortion, and patients who did not undergo follow-up. Therefore, 20 patients' data were excluded and 50 UCLP patients' images were included in this study. The images were classified as follows: group 0: before bone grafting, 50 images, group 1: one month after bone grafting, 33 images, group 2: 2-4 months after bone grafting, 24 images, group 3: 5-7 months after bone grafting, 15  The CAD system 11 was used to select two regions of interest (ROIs), the 'non-cleft side' and 'cleft side'. The CAD algorithm was implemented by a technical comput-ing language (MATLAB R2010a, MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The ROI, a square portion of 64\u00d764 pixels, was extracted by dragging the mouse from a randomly selected single point to 64 pixels left and 64 pixels downward. The tooth structure, periodontal ligament, and lamina dura were excluded from each ROI. Next, the noise was removed by median filtering. Morphological skeletonization was then used to extract the medial axis of the trabecular bone, which was regarded as the prominent region that was brighter than the surrounding structures, and subsequently, the images were enlarged 64-fold. The 'strel' function was selected from the computing language to ], the first element was the number of rows in the structuring element neighbourhood; the second element was the number of columns. Then, the most basic morphological operations, which were 'erosion' and 'dilation,' were performed. The 'erosion' function removed pixels on the object boundaries, while dilation added pixels to the boundaries of objects in an image. The number of pixels added or removed from the objects in an image depends on the size and the shape of the structuring element used to process the image. Finally, the pixel area calculation was used to estimate the area of the trabecular bone in the binary image, that is, the digital image that had only two possible values for each pixel, namely 0 and 1 (Figs. 1 and 2). The pixel area of the \"non-cleft side\" and \"cleft side\" from group 0 to group 4 were calculated and compared. The measurements were made five times, once a week, on each side by an oral radiologist. Five positions were randomly selected at the \"non-cleft side\" and \"cleft side\" on the same image. All of the pixel areas of the image were then calculated. Statistical tests were performed using SPSS 10.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were applied. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate a normally distributed pixel area. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used when the data did not show normal distribution and the paired samples t test was used when the data showed normal distribution. The study design was approved by the Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee for Human Research.",

            "text": "Alveolar bone grafting in patients with cleft lip and palate is now a common practice owing to several advantages. It can help to prevent the collapse and constriction of the dental arch, to close the oronasal fistula, and to allow eruption of teeth into the cleft. The bone grafting is fully revascularized between 14 and 21 days, and new bone is formed in approximately six weeks and has matured after six months. 12 It is generally thought that osseous healing of transplants is completed six months after the operation. Nightingale et al compared three methods of radiographic assessment, the Bergland, Kindelan, and Chelsea scales, which produced great reproducibility rather than validity. 9 Over-and under-estimation of the success rate of the alveolar bone grafting has also been reported in some cases. 13 The CAD system, therefore, has been developed to determine the bone quantity in the alveolar cleft after bone grafting. This CAD system uses mathematical morphology and calculates the area on the binary images that can be produced by MathWorks. Our results showed that the pixel areas from the binary images in the \"cleft side\" were significantly smaller than those on the \"non-cleft side\" in group 0 (before bone grafting) and group 1 (one month after bone grafting). This means that the trabecular bone increased but was still less than the normal side. In addition, there was no significant difference found in group 2 (2-4 months after bone grafting) and group 3 (5-7 months after bone grafting), which means the trabecular bone gradually increased in the 2-4 months and was similar to the normal bone within 5-7 months. It should be noted that the new bone formation with osteoid deposition indicated remodeling of 25-55% at 3 months postoperatively and the grafted bone had a denser structure than the control \u2500 228 \u2500 Evaluation of alveolar bone grafting in unilateral cleft lip and palate patients using a computer-aided diagnosis system Table 1.
