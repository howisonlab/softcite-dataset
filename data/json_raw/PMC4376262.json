A poly-(N-pvinylbenzyl-4-O-\u03b2-D-galactopyranosyl-D-gluconamide) matrix can recognize cells and promote liver function in a spheroid structure because of a specific galactose-asialoglycoprotein receptor interaction. Meanwhile, a fusion protein, E-cadherin-Fc, when incubated with various cells, has shown an enhancing effect on cellular viability and metabolism. Therefore, a hybrid substratum was developed for biomedical applications by using both of these materials to combine their advantages for primary hepatocyte cultures. The isolated cells showed a monolayer aggregate morphology on the coimmobilized surface and displayed higher functional expression than cells on traditional matrices. Furthermore, the hybrid system, in which the highest levels of cell adhesion and hepatocellular metabolism were achieved with the addition of 1% fetal bovine serum, showed a lower serum dependency than the collagen/gelatin-coated surface. Accordingly, this substrate may attenuate the negative effects of serum and further contribute to establishing a defined culture system for primary hepatocytes.",

            "text": "Hepatocytes, which compose the majority of the cellular mass in the liver, play many complex roles in the metabolism of living organisms; these functions include detoxification, metabolism, bile secretion, immune defense, and protein synthesis. 1 The features of isolated hepatocytes from adult mammals during in vitro primary incubation may reflect the general properties of these cells in vivo. Accordingly, a valuable cellular model has been established for studies regarding the regulation of the functionality, senescence, and transformation of liver cells. Because of their easy access, the cells are widely utilized in clinical trials to investigate hepatic function, estimate xenobiotic metabolism, establish artificial organs in vitro, and further regenerate tissue in vivo. 2,3 However, hepatocytes tend to lose their reproductive activity and specific liver function steadily after isolation. Meanwhile, attempts to replace primary cells by using permanent cells or even cancer cell lines have also encountered drawbacks because the substitute cells are not fully consistent with primary cells with regard to metabolism and functionality. Therefore, the use of a primary culture of hepatocytes remains a significant challenge, and various techniques have been devised to promote cellular viability and functional expression; these methods include the development of extracellular matrix (ECM) substrata, soluble factor supplements, and coculture systems. 4,5 Appropriate modifications of physical and chemical methods for culture matrices may lead to the retention of the cellular replication capacity and differentiated functions in hepatocytes. Cell-recognizable materials have become increasingly available for the construction of cell culture substrata, which can mimic the in vivo conditions to provide specific ECMs for specific cell lineages to induce functional differentiation. Among these materials, poly-(Np-vinylbenzyl-4-O-\u03b2-D-galactopyranosyl-D-gluconamide) (PVLA) possesses galactose termini on its side chains and can specifically recognize hepatocytes through an interaction between asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs) on the cellular membrane and the polymer. 6,7 ASGPR is a membrane receptor on liver cells, and its primary physiological function is to internalize galactose from circulating blood. 8 It is further involved in the removal of apoptotic cells and acts as a carrier of low-density lipoprotein and as an entry point for hepatotropic viruses or DNA. 9 ASGPR, in association with PVLA, assists primary hepatocytes in forming a multilayered aggregate morphology on the matrix. The liver-specific functions of the incubated cells on the galactose-carrying polymer, including ammonia removal and albumin secretion, have been found to be enhanced over the long term. 10,11 Moreover, a chimeric protein, E-cadherin-Fc (EFC), composed of the E-cadherin extracellular domain and the immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc domain, is capable of enhancing the cellular viability of endodermal cells. 12 The protein-coated surface could further preserve the hepatocellular functions and metabolism of hepatic cell lineages. 12,13 This combination in the culture system can promote the hepatic induction of embryonic stem cells in the late stage of oriented differentiation. 14 In addition, primary hepatocytes were incubated with serum in early experiments to promote cellular behaviors. 15 However, it is possible that the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the culture medium may produce a nonimmunosuppressive condition and introduce xenobiotic substances into the system. The supplementation of the serum can increase the risk of disease transmission, including spongiform encephalitis, when the cells are expanded for clinical transplantation. Because of its instability in composition and quality, serum supplementation may further lead to a reduction in cellular metabolism. 16 In one experiment, cells were maintained in a hormonally defined medium because of their response to hepatotropic growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-\u03b1, and insulin, to stabilize the culture system and reduce the negative influence. Although the cost of the incubation system, especially for massive cell culture, was increased, the cellular behaviors in this system were preserved or even promoted. Therefore, it is beneficial if the PVLA matrix does not require serum for hepatocyte maintenance and induction. 17,18 In this study, isolated hepatocytes were seeded on a hybrid substrate of PVLA and EFC to achieve monolayer aggregate morphology in vitro. Increased functional and metabolic expression were observed in primary hepatocytes at both the gene and protein levels, unlike in the cells on collagen or gelatin surfaces. The effects of serum concentration (0%, 1%, and 10%) on cellular attachment, maintenance, and hepatic marker expression were further analyzed, and a low serum dependency in the cell-recognizable system with dual components was revealed.",

Then, EFC and PVLA were successively added to a nontreated PS surface and evaluated by using the QCM method ( Figure 1B). EFC with a concentration less than the monolayer concentration (2.5 \u03bcg/mL) was immobilized on a dish surface, and space was left for subsequent PVLA addition.

Moreover, the serum requirement for the cells to achieve the maximal adherence on each surface differed in accordance with the substrata. In particular, on the hybrid matrix and on the PVLA surface, the number of hepatocytes was higher for the cells supplied with 1% FBS than for the cells supplied with serum at other concentrations ( Figure 2E). The cells exhibited better attachment to traditional matrices, including collagen and gelatin, with a serum supply in the concentration range of approximately 0%-10% ( Figure 2E); further increases in serum concentration showed no additional beneficial influence. 23 Aside from the hepatocytes on PVLA-coated dishes, the differences in cell viability on the other three matrices are statistically significant among the different FBS concentrations (0%, 1%, and 10%) supplied for the cultures.",

One day after seeding, the primary hepatocytes revealed a monolayer morphology on coimmobilized ( Figure 3A and G) and gelatincoated surfaces ( Figure 3C and I), while they maintained a round shape on PVLA surfaces ( Figure 3B and H). During continuous incubation, the hepatocytes clustered in the culture systems because of the presence of PVLA, whereas the cells spread out on the gelatin and other traditional matrices. Finally, the cells formed monolayer aggregates on the hybrid matrix ( Figure 3D and J) and multilayer spheroid structures on PVLA-coated dishes ( Figure 3E and K) after 5 days in culture. Furthermore, the viability of the maintained cells reached the highest level at each time point (days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) with a concentration of 1% FBS on the hybrid matrix and on PVLA ( Figure 4A); however, a higher serum concentration could possibly enhance cell maintenance in the gelatin or collagen systems. The highest cell numbers, in ascending order for different time points, occurred on the following surfaces: PVLA \ue02c hybrid surface \ue02c gelatin and collagen, especially in the early culture period. The total number of cells gradually became smaller over time, and finally remained similar among these systems on days 7 and 9. Moreover, the number of remaining hepatocytes relative to the initial cell number during 1 week was higher on the surfaces with PVLA than on the other matrices supplemented with the optimal serum concentrations ( Figure 4B).",

Our results indicated that both the matrix and serum in the culture system may affect the cellular behavior of isolated hepatocytes. The immunofluorescence staining method revealed the expression of the proteins, including albumin and ASGPR, in primary hepatocytes. After 1 day, most of the isolated cells expressed albumin (red, Figure 3A-C) and ASGPR (green, Figure 3G-I), both in relatively high levels on various matrices, although different patterns were revealed that included both contracted and spread out morphology. The hepatocytes on the hybrid matrix and PVLA-coated dish further maintained albumin (red, Figure 3D and F) and ASGPR (green, Figure 3J and K) expression in large amounts after 5 days, whereas the amount of expression rapidly decreased on other matrices. After 1 day and again after 5 days, the hepatic genes responsible for the liver function in cells on the hybrid substrate of PVLA and EFC were examined by PCR ( Figure 5A). It has been reported that the cellular transcription markers can be regulated in complex environments, including ones that contain hormones, cytokines, xenobiotics, and ECMs. We found that the cells on the coimmobilized matrix of PVLA and EFC maintained expression of liver-specific genes, including those for albumin, HNF-4\u03b1, and ASGPR, for at least 5 days ( Figure 5A). Among all the hybrid systems with various concentrations of serum, the coimmobilized matrix with 1% FBS exhibited an optimal performance in preserving hepatic expression, especially after long-term incubation. Meanwhile, compared to the gelatin surface (10% FBS), the PVLA/EFC matrix (1% FBS) may have to a greater extent enhanced the expression levels of mature markers in primary hepatocytes, such as albumin ( Figure 5B), HNF-4\u03b1 ( Figure 5C), and ASGPR ( Figure 5D) at each time point. During the incubation, the isolated hepatocytes on the hybrid substratum showed no sharp declines in the expression of these genes, whereas the expression rapidly decreased on the control surface. The preservation effect was particularly evident in the markers, including HNF-4\u03b1 ( Figure 5C) and ASGPR ( Figure 5D), that were expressed in highly mature hepatic cells.",

The fusion protein was intended to be applied for cell recognition and incubation. The artificial substratum may selectively recognize endoderm cells and further determine the differentiation direction of stem cells in the endodermal system, including cells of hepatic lineage. 12 Therefore, we combined the virtues of E-cadherin and galactose-carrying biomaterials in the hepatic culture. Specifically, the hybrid system for mouse primary hepatocytes was devised by immobilizing EFC molecules after PVLA addition onto a hydrophobic surface, and culture media without any cytokines but various concentrations (v/v 0%, 1%, and 10%) of FBS were used. The beneficial effects of the coimmobilized substratum on the cellular phenotype, serum dependency, and functional expression were revealed at both the gene and protein levels.",

It is believed that cellular adhesion is mediated through the specific recognition of ECM molecules by receptors on the cellular membrane. The attachment of cells onto natural substrata depends on the competitive adsorption of proteins (including the proteins that constitute the ECMs) that are added to the culture medium or secreted by cells. The bioactive compounds in serum have been confirmed to significantly affect the cellular behaviors on ECMs such as collagen, gelatin, and fibronectin. In addition to the action of cellular attachment, FBS also provides essential nutrients for cell growth. Therefore, increasing the serum amount within the environment may enhance the number of attached cells, and a concentration of 10% FBS may induce most of the viable cells to anchor to the traditional matrices.",

Consistent with nature, hepatocyte attachment on PVLA is not mediated by integrin, and anoikis is further suppressed in the system. 17,29 It has been reported that only the hepatocytes with a high maturity level can steadily attach to PVLA surfaces because of the large number of ASGPRs present on the cellular membrane. The selective effect of the polymer is the reason that cell attachment to the pure PVLA matrix is limited. Thus, the number of attached cells was less than the number of isolated liver cells, which consist of hepatocytes of both high and low maturity levels and nonparenchymal cells. 30 The addition of E-cadherin to the system could attract more hepatocytes with an inadequate amount of ASGPRs to attach to the matrix because hepatocytes belong to the endoderm cell lineage. Thus, the limitation on cellular attachment was extended; however, among the hybrid systems with different FBS concentration, the largest amount of cell attachment was found on the matrix supplied with 1% FBS; this amount was still lower than the number of cells attached to the gelatin and collagen surfaces with 10% serum.",

However, the application of serum can possibly introduce inhomogeneity and immunogenicity and raise the cost of the culture system. Therefore, it remains important to reduce the addition of serum during the incubation of primary hepatocytes after attachment. In this study, the PVLA surface could tightly immobilize the isolated hepatocytes after cell capture. The cadherin-mediated cellular adhesion on the coimmobilized matrix had the capability to enhance cell maintenance in the culture system without causing cell detachment and resulted in the morphological differences among the galactose-carrying matrices. Finally, after 1 week in culture or longer, the number of residual hepatocytes declined to a similar cellular density with scarcely any hepatic markers on each combination of substratum and FBS concentration (Figure 4). Therefore, the hybrid substratum exhibited an excellent capacity to maintain the cell number and low serum dependency as well.",

Meanwhile, the E-cadherin in the matrix helped to maintain the cells in a monolayer morphology, which kept the cells in a homogeneous environment.

The highest expression level observed in the hybrid system with a small quantity of FBS in the medium was speculated to be the result of the initiating and nourishing effect of serum in a very low concentration. The ability of the hybrid system to maintain the hepatocytes under low-serum or serum-free conditions allows the elimination of the negative effects of animal products in clinical applications and establishment of a completely defined culture system for hepatocytes.",

For mouse primary hepatocytes, it provided the ideal culture conditions, which are able to support cell proliferation and differentiation and further prevent interference and infection of biological products. The hybrid system may be further applied in the induction of stem cells to hepatocytes and has the advantages of promoting the affinity of hepatic cells and allowing low dependency on serum.",
