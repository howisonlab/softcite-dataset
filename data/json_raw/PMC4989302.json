High-throughput sequencing technologies provide opportunities to screen whole habitats in depth and enable detailed comparisons of different habitats to measure, compare and map protistan diversity. Such comparisons are often limited by low sample numbers within single studies and a lack of standardisation between studies. Here, we analysed 232 samples from 10 sampling campaigns using a standardised PCR protocol and bioinformatics pipeline. We show that protistan community patterns are highly consistent within habitat types and geographic regions, provided that sample processing is standardised. Community profiles are only weakly affected by fluctuations of the abundances of the most abundant taxa and, therefore, provide a sound basis for habitat comparison beyond random short-term fluctuations in the community composition. Further, we provide evidence that distribution patterns are not solely resulting from random processes. Distinct habitat types and distinct taxonomic groups are dominated by taxa with distinct distribution patterns that reflect their ecology with respect to dispersal and habitat colonisation. However, there is no systematic shift of the distribution pattern with taxon abundance.",

            "text": "The ecological key role of protists is sharply contrasted by an only vague understanding of their diversity. During the past decade, the assumption of unlimited dispersal of protists was progressively replaced by the 'moderate endemicity model' (Foissner, 2006;Bass and Boenigk, 2011; but see Livermore and Jones, 2015). With the increasing acceptance of dispersal limitations in protists, the research focus turned to the underlying patterns of protist distribution and the generalisability of such patterns across protistan taxa and across different habitat types (Katz et al., 2005;Bik et al., 2012). Owing to methodical limitations, analyses of protistan distribution patterns up to recently were centred around a handful of more or less abundant taxa (for example, Lop\u00e9z-Garc\u00eda et al., 2001;Moreira and L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda, 2002). High-throughput sequencing has already revolutionised environmental surveys of microbial organisms and opened the door for large-scale analyses of molecular microbial community analyses. Generating many millions of reads, these methods allow for deep-sequencing of microbial communities (Caporaso et al., 2012) and make possible a much more realistic understanding of protistan diversity and distribution than former, lower capacity technologies (Medinger et al., 2010;Lecroq et al., 2011;Degnan and Ochman, 2012).",

Multiplex Identifiers were used to separate the different samples. Chimeras were removed using UCHIME (USEARCH v.6) (Edgar et al., 2011). Subsequently, the sequences that passed the quality filtering were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with UCLUST version 6 (Edgar, 2010) at 97% sequence identity for further analyses. Sequences were sorted by abundance beforehand clustering and clustering was performed for all sequences of all sampling campaigns at a time (that is, not individually by campaigns). For all OTUs, we used BLASTn version 2.2.25+ (Altschul et al., 1990) with the nucleotide collection database nr/nt and the NCBI Taxonomy Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ taxonomy; RefSeq Release 57 (14 January 2013)) to annotate the OTUs with taxonomic information.

The 'rest' categories within the analysis are meant to collect minor groups and OTUs without further affiliation within Alveolata, Stramenopiles, Rhizaria and Excavata in order to fully show the protistan diversity present in the samples. Eukaryotic OTUs that are not met by one of the given taxonomic groups or have not been deleted from the data set for the given reasons are shown as 'others'.

Therefore, we used a two-step standardisation of site data; first, rarefaction of the sites was done using the 'drarefy' function provided by the VEGAN R package (Oksanen et al., 2013), followed by Hellinger transformation (Legendre and Gallagher, 2001). After application of these procedures, the resulting pretransformed data matrix of OTUs can be submitted to Ward cluster analysis and further multivariate analyses (see Figures 1a and b; Legendre and Gallagher, 2001;Borcard et al., 2011). Cluster analysis could be calculated on both the OTU and the meta-group level (for chosen metagroups see above). The principle component analysis based on Hellinger distances shows those taxonomic groups with most explanatory value for clustering and separation of samples (see Figure 1b).",

The more classical 'rrarefy' is not suitable here, as recently pointed out by McMurdie and Holmes (2014). Thus, more exact relationships of meta-groups from higher read levels are kept intact (see Figure 1a); however, this could possibly result in OTU percentages per meta-group of less than 1 at a read level of 100. The community structures of the different samples were analysed using the mean relative abundance of meta-group reads per sampling, which showed significant differences between meta-groups among sampling campaigns (see Figure 2, also compare Supplementary Table  S2).",

Although not common, a two-parameter Weibull density distribution, which is used in survival and engineering analyses, fitted our data. Recently, a three-parameter Weibull empirical cumulative distribution function was used for fitting diversity curves (Livermore and Jones, 2015), showing the applicability of the Weibull distribution in ecology. For our data, the fitting of the Weibull distribution among sites (y-axis = no. of sites, xaxis = abundance of OTU in these sites) passed the KS-test (that is, the null hypothesis could not be rejected, P-value: 40.05) for almost all OTUs and was consequently used as the distribution for further analysis. All KS-tests were performed with R, referring to Birnbaum and Tingey (1951). All OTUs passed the KS-test (that is, the Weibull distribution could not be rejected with all P-values 40.9) when P-values were corrected for multiple testing by using p.adjust (method = 'fdr', R package 'stats'). When corrections for multiple testing were disregarded, the KS-test rejected the Weibull distribution for 10 out of 1249 OTUs. Even though these 10 OTUs passed the test when correctly applied (that is, corrected for multiple testing), we decided to mark these OTUs in the figures (Figures 3a and b, top). The shape parameter k of the Weibull distribution is suitable for comparing the distribution of abundant and less abundant taxa as the total abundance primarily affects the scale, but not the shape parameter. Therefore, we focus on the comparative analysis of the parameter k. For k = 1, the two-parameter Weibull distribution switches to that of the exponential distribution, for k~3.6 it switches to a Gaussian distribution. The k-values in this study all lie between 1 and 3.6 forming curves of positive skewness. The skewness of the curves as a function of k indicates the value of evenness of OTU reads over sites and is, therefore, suitable of showing distribution patterns of taxa. Shape values k of Weibull distributions were compared using Mann-Whitney U-tests. All U-tests were performed with Sigmaplot 12.5 (Systat Software Inc., Erkrath, Germany) referring to Mann and Whitney (1947).",

            "text": "For the analysis of OTU distribution patterns among sites, we analysed the shape parameter k of the Weibull distribution (see the Materials and methods section). This analysis only revealed a minor modulation in the shape factor of the Weibull distribution between abundant and less abundant taxa. The mean Weibull shape value k is rather similar irrespective of the relative overall abundance of the OTUs (Figure 3a, top). Shape values of individual OTUs scatter around a median of 1.67, but there was no distinct change in the median k for less abundant OTUs. The median shape value of 1.67 indicates that taxon distribution is not due to unlimited random dispersal (which would favour a value of 1 or lower, that is, a colonisation from one site with high frequency), but on the contrary that some factors work against invasion and/or colonisation of habitats (significant U-test of shape value 1.67 vs 1, P-value: o0.001). One might argue that this effect is caused by the different habitat types included in the analysis. However, even when the analysis is restricted to one habitat type within a distinct geographic region, taxon distribution cannot exclusively be explained by unlimited random dispersal (for example, soil sites UK: shape parameter = 2.099, significant U-test vs 1, P-value: o0.001; for example, Austrian lakes+Lake District 1: shape parameter = 1.711, significant U-test vs 1, Pvalue o0.001; compare methods in this paper and Figure 3a-mid and bottom). In contrast, the shape parameter is even higher when the analysis is restricted to soils, indicating that random dispersal is even less important in soils compared with aquatic habitats. However, the scatter around the median k increases for rare taxa (Figure 3b, top right). Similarly, the scatter of sites of occurrence as a function of total read number increases (Figure 3b,  top left). In contrast, the most abundant taxa do have very similar distribution patterns, indicated by both a very similar shape parameter in the Weibull distribution (Figure 3b, top right) and a narrow range of the ratio of number of sites vs total read abundance (Figure 3b, top left). Both observations indicate a stronger differentiation of distribution patterns in rare taxa, whereas abundant taxa show relatively uniform distribution patterns. Owing to this, within the rare taxa, a differentiation into more generalist taxa (occurring at a relatively high number of sites) and more specialised taxa (restricted to a few sites) is pronounced.",

The scientific dispute can be traced back at least to de Candolle (1820) and Ehrenberg (1849Ehrenberg ( , 1850. With the catchy phrase 'Everything is everywhere, but the habitat selects' Baas-Becking formulated the central idea behind the ongoing dispute (Bass and Boenigk, 2011;Boenigk, 2014). In this form, the idea of global dispersal was revived in the 1980s, resulting in the recent debate on protist dispersal and endemism as summarised by O'Malley (2007), de Wit and Bouvier (2006) and Bass and Boenigk (2011). It is now generally believed that protist distributions cannot be explained exclusively by unlimited dispersal (Foissner, 2006;Bass and Boenigk, 2011), expressed, for instance, by the moderate endemicity model (Foissner, 1999(Foissner, , 2004(Foissner, , 2006. However, microbial organisms may, in general, show wider distribution patterns as compared with higher organisms (Livermore and Jones, 2015). We demonstrate that the distribution patterns of individual protistan OTUs, specifically as expressed by the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution, violate the assumption of unlimited dispersal. This is consistent with findings of Livermore and Jones (2015) who demonstrated for bacteria that microbial diversity patterns non-randomly vary between ecosystem types. Our analysis further shows that patterns of non-random dispersal are stronger in soil habitats than aquatic habitats.",

These community profiles were highly specific for distinct habitat types. Even seasonal variation did not blur the distinctiveness of community structure. Therefore, community profiles based on high-throughput sequencing data (in this case the 18S rDNA V9 region) appear highly promising for overarching habitat comparisons as well as for long-term monitoring studies.",

The high number of rare taxa led to the assumption that rarity might be an evolutionarily advantageous trait in these organisms (Logares et al., 2014) and favoured speculations on potentially deviating distribution patterns between rare and abundant taxa (for example, Nolte et al., 2010). In contrast to these earlier studies, we show that rare and abundant taxa have generally similar distribution patterns. However, whereas the distribution patterns of individual taxa are relatively uniform for abundant OTUs, the deviation among individual rare OTUs is high. Further, the proportion of rare and abundant taxa differs distinctively by habitat type: the soil samples are characterised by a high evenness, that is, a multitude of OTUs appear at higher abundances in many of the samples. On the contrary, aquatic sites have a comparatively lower evenness with usually only a small number of dominant species reaching higher abundances, accompanied by many rare taxa, at a distinct point in time. Thus, in addition to taxonomic profile/community structure differences between habitats, abundance and diversity patterns appear to be characteristic for different habitat types.",

In general, broad niche widths and high ecophysiological tolerances should be reflected by broad distributions of taxa across different samples. In contrast, taxa with more restricted niche widths and/or ecophysiological tolerances should be restricted to fewer samples. The largely uniform distribution patterns for abundant OTUs indicate that dispersal and success of colonisation is largely comparable between taxa, resulting in similar distribution patterns. Within the rare biosphere, however, distribution patterns vary strongly between individual taxa, presumably indicating a more selective niche adaptation. Thus, we suspect that the rare biosphere offers an even stronger potential use for comparative habitat analyses, including biological monitoring, as compared to the more abundant taxa, which are usually the focus of such studies.",

The Chrysophytes, for instance, show intermediate distribution patterns. These differences in distribution presumably indicate a differential dispersal and proliferation among taxa even on higher taxonomic levels, including not all, but most OTUs of a higher taxonomic group. With regard to taxonomy, it seems plausible that distributions are markedly different between soil-inhabiting and endobenthic taxa, such as Amoebozoa, which are presumably less prone to random dispersal, and planktonic or epibenthic taxa.",

Further, rare and abundant taxa do not show generally different patterns of distribution. The variation of distribution patterns in rare taxa is, however, much more pronounced making the rare biosphere as revealed by molecular investigations a promising candidate for comparative habitat analyses. For analyses as undertaken herein, standardisation of a large number of samples is essential and can be provided by largescale, methodologically unified data sets and parallel investigations made possible by high-throughput methods. Such investigations are more directly comparable than data sets generated by different 'wet' laboratory conditions (PCR protocols, cycling conditions, reagents, etc.) and different bioinformatic methods. This unified/standardised approach is recommended for revealing robust and fine-scale differences between community structures and distributions of taxa that might be missed or skewed by non-standardised comparisons. This is important for further illuminating the biodiversity and biology of protists on Earth and thus broaden our knowledge on these and other under-researched microorganisms.",
