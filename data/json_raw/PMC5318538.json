The present study aimed to examine serum inflammatory markers in preclinical stages of dementia and in AD, as well as to investigate their associations with concomitant CeVD. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional case-control study including 96 AD, 140 cognitively impaired no dementia (CIND), and 79 noncognitively impaired participants. All subjects underwent neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessments, as well as collection of blood samples for measurements of serum samples interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor a levels. Subjects were classified as CIND or dementia based on clinical criteria. Significant CeVD, including whitematter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes, and cortical infarcts, was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Results: After controlling for covariates, higher concentrations of IL-8, but not the other measured cytokines, were associated with both CIND and AD only in the presence of significant CeVD (CIND with CeVD: odds ratios [ORs] 4.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-13.4 and AD with CeVD: OR 7.26; 95% CI 1.2-43.3). Subsequent multivariate analyses showed that among the types of CeVD assessed, only WMH was associated with higher IL-8 levels in CIND and AD (WMH: OR 2.81; 95% CI 1.4-5.6). Discussion: Serum IL-8 may have clinical utility as a biomarker for WMH in AD. Longitudinal follow-up studies would help validate these findings."

Accumulating evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays an essential role in AD pathogenesis [3], with alterations of brain cytokine levels reported [4,5]. Furthermore, activated microglia and astrocytes as well as increased concentrations of inflammatory mediators have been detected in the vicinity of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in AD brain [3]. Indeed, meta-analyses of observational studies indicate a significant association between the long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and lowered risk of AD [6].",

            "text": "Neuroinflammation, when occurring in the acute phase and resolved in a timely manner, is beneficial in combating pathogens and in tissue repair. But a chronic neuroinflammatory response may contribute to neurodegeneration [7]. Cytokines released from such neuroinflammatory processes are known to be mirrored in the periphery, thus allowing measurements of potential biomarkers [8,9], which at present include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers (combined phosphotau and b-amyloid 38/42) and neuroimaging (hippocampal atrophy, amyloid positron emission tomography) [10][11][12]. However, the invasiveness and high costs associated with neuroimaging and CSF investigations have hindered their wide clinical application. In contrast, the minimal invasiveness and relative low cost of blood-based investigations have stimulated research into assessments of their feasibility as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Indeed, several studies of circulating cytokines have been reported (albeit with inconsistent findings), with the majority of these studies focused on staging after a diagnosis of dementia has been made [4,5,[13][14][15][16]. As neuroinflammation is thought to be involved in disease pathogenesis in early stages, it is important to also investigate inflammatory markers in predementia stages such as mild cognitive impairment or cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND), which are associated with increased risk of AD but may also represent better prospects for treatment and/or prevention [17,18].",

Of  Table 1 shows the demographic variables of the study cohort. In comparison to NCI, CIND and AD were older, had lower education levels, higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The concentration values of inflammatory markers in the samples ranged from 0.3 to 60.0 pg/mL for IL-6, 1.3 to 47.0 pg/mL for IL-8, and 0.9 to 17.5 pg/mL for TNFa. The lowest detectable values were used in statistical analyses for cases whose concentrations fell below detectable range (0.2 pg/mL was used for IL-6 for 28 cases in NCI group, 50 cases in CIND group, and 20 cases in AD group; 0.3 pg/mL was used for TNFa for two cases in NCI group and 1 case in CIND group). As shown in Table 1, levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNFa were highest in AD and lowest in NCI, with intermediate levels in CIND. The differences were statistically significant for IL-8 in both CIND and AD, whereas IL-6 and TNFa were significantly raised only in AD. Table 2 shows the multivariate analyses of associations between serum inflammatory markers and clinical diagnoses. There was no association between IL-6 and CIND or AD after adjustment for covariates of age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54 carrier, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases, whereas the highest tertile of IL-8 was associated with CIND and AD. In contrast, the highest tertile of TNFa was associated with AD but not CIND when unadjusted (data not shown), but the association did not remain after adjusting for covariates. Interestingly, when stratified by the presence or absence of significant CeVD (Table 3), the highest tertile of IL-8 was associated with both CIND and AD only in the presence of CeVD, whereas no associations were found for IL-6 and TNFa in the presence or absence of CeVD. Finally, to uncover whether IL-8 was associated with a specific type of CeVD, we performed separate logistic regression analyses for WMH, presence of cortical infarcts and lacunes with adjustment for unmatched demographic and risk factors, as well as the corresponding nontested MRI markers. Table 4 shows the association between the highest tertile of IL-8 and MRI markers was with WMH (ARWMC total score 8), but not with presence of cortical infarct nor lacunes (two or more).",

In this study, we found that high-serum IL-8 was associated with both CIND and AD only in the presence of CeVD, specifically with significant WMH, independent of age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54 carrier status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, as well as cortical infarct and lacunes. This finding corroborates previous work showing high IL-8 in cognitively impaired patients associated with vascular cognitive impairment [29]. IL-8 has been known to initiate acute inflammation, and our data support the involvement of elevated IL-8 in the chronic neuroinflammation of AD which may be related to cerebrovascular damage [30]. Actually, significant elevations in plasma IL-8 levels in cognitive impairment have also been reported by others [5,13], although there are also conflicting data showing lower IL-8 level in mild cognitive impairment and AD [31]. The mechanism underlying associations of IL-8 with WMH is at present unclear. The disease processes may be related to microglial activation-associated upregulation of cytokines besides inducible nitric oxide synthase [32], which in turn trigger increases in proinflammatory and pro-oxidant nitric oxide, affect brain microvessel endothelia, and result in white-matter lesions detectable as WMH by MRI [33,34]. Although these lesions have been shown to be associated with, and predict for, cognitive impairment [35][36][37], whether such processes actually link IL-8 with white-matter lesions will require follow-up studies.",

However, our study has several limitations as well. First, because of the case-control design of the study, it is not possible to establish the temporal association between these markers and the development of cognitive impairment. Further follow-up prospective validation studies will address these limitations. Furthermore, the cases and controls, though representative of the elderly population in Singapore, were derived from two settings, that is, memory clinic and community. Finally, the control group was relatively younger and had lower CeVD burden compared to cases which could have resulted in selection bias and residual confounding."
