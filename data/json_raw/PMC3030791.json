We assessed the perioperative outcome and the risk for cancer in patients operated on laparoscopically for colonic polyps not amenable to colonoscopic resection. Methods: An evaluation was conducted of our prospective accumulated data of a consecutive series of patients operated on for colonic polyps. Results: Sixty-four patients underwent laparoscopic resection for colonic polyps during a 6-year period. This group comprised 18% of all our laparoscopic colorectal procedures. Forty-six percent were males, mean age was 71. Most of the polyps (66%) were located on the right side. No deaths occurred. Conversion was necessary in 3 patients (4.6%). Significant complications occurred in 3 patients (4.6%). Nine patients (14%) were found to have malignancy. Three of them had lymph-node involvement. No difference existed in polyp size between malignant and nonmalignant lesions. Conclusions: Laparoscopic colectomy for endoscopic nonresectable colonic polyps is a safe, simple procedure as reflected by the low rate of conversions and complications. However, invasive cancer may be found in the final pathology following surgery. This mandates a strict adherence to surgical oncological principles. Polyp size cannot predict the risk of malignancy.",

            "text": "Endoscopic polypectomy is the standard treatment for colon and rectal polyps and is indicated to prevent future colorectal cancer. Some of these polyps cannot be resected endoscopically due to technical factors and risk of complications. Factors related to polyp size (occupies more than one-third of bowel circumference or 2 haustral folds), type (flat/sessile), and location (ileocecal valve, flexures) might exclude the polyp from being excised endoscopically and expose the patient to the risk of bleeding and perforation. [1][2][3] Polyps that are endoscopically nonresectable would need surgical removal. The laparoscopic approach with its associated advantages provides an optimal choice to the management of these polyps. Laparoscopic colorectal surgeries include a wide spectrum of procedures for a variety of different pathologies and have different levels of difficulty and surgical considerations. The adoption of laparoscopy for colorectal cancer has been slow to evolve due to concerns over its oncological safety. 4 In recent years, large multi-center prospective randomized studies 5,6 have demonstrated the oncological safety of these procedures in cancer patients. However, a prerequisite for a safe oncological operation is surgeon experience and adherence to surgical oncological principles. 7 Oncological factors are not involved in the laparoscopic approach for benign colorectal entities; however, the common benign entities, such as inflammatory bowel disease and diverticular disease, may be a hostile environment for the laparoscopic surgeon due to distorted anatomy and the need to handle friable and inflamed tissue.",

Mobilization of the colon and tissue dissection is generally simpler and easier during surgery for polyps because no inflammatory process is involved and no bulky tumors are present. Our perioperative results demonstrate a low conversion rate of approximately 5%, low significant complication rate, and no mortality. These results are comparable to results of other recent published reports 11,12 and are better compared with laparoscopy for other colorectal entities, such as malignant tumors or diverticular disease. 8,13 Strong emphasis should be placed on preoperative localization of the polyps. Polyps located in the cecal area do not need to be marked. In these cases, a formal right colectomy is performed any way. For polyps at any other location, localization procedures are highly recommended. We routinely perform endoscopic tattooing before surgery because lack of preoperative localization may lead to conversion. 14 Intraoperative colonoscopy may be performed as well; however, it may result in hyperinflation of the bowel, thus obscuring the laparoscopic view. 15 CO 2 colonoscopy may serve as a good alternative in these cases as the CO 2 is absorbed very rapidly from the colonic lumen. 16 The distribution of polyp location in our series revealed a majority of polyps (66%) located on the right side. This finding is in accordance with the findings in other series of laparoscopic colectomy for polyps, which report 76% to 78% of patients with right-sided polyps. 11,12,17 This finding is interesting because most of polyps removed endoscopically are located in the left colonic side. 18 The fact that most of the surgically removed polyps are right-sided may reflect the reluctance of the endoscopist to resect large and difficult to locate polyps in the right colon because of the fear of complications like perforation of the relatively thin right colonic wall.",

In our series, 14% of the patients had malignancy in their final pathology despite the benign endoscopic appearance and pathology results before surgery. Moreover, most of the patients, 6 out of 9, who were found to have cancer, had advanced stage tumors (Stage II or more). Higher percentages of up to 22% cancer identified in the final pathology and a high rate of advanced cancer have been reported in other recently published series 11,12,17  (Table 2).",

In our series, 6 of 9 patients who had cancer (33%) had a polyp size \u05452cm, and the average size of these polyps was not different from the average size of the benign polyps as has been shown by others. 11 An interesting optional treatment modality for difficult colonic polyps is a combination of laparoscopy and endoscopy. 21,22 In this technique, the laparoscopic surgeon helps to manipulate the bowel to allow a simultaneous endoscopic resection and at the same time monitors the procedure for possible perforation. This technique may prevent unnecessary segmental resections; however, it mandates a specific surgical set up of different teams. In addition, all specimens should be evaluated intraoperatively for cancer so the surgeon can decide on formal resection.",

The incidence of malignancy and specifically advanced staged tumors documented on final pathology may be high and cannot be ruled out before surgery. These study results emphasize the fact that colonic lesions with benign pathology that have an endoscopic benign polypoid appearance may also harbor an invasive cancer. We believe that this is a major consideration when operating on these patients, mandating strict adherence to surgical oncological principles with adequate lymph node harvesting and wound precautions. Surgeons experienced with laparoscopy for colorectal cancer should be involved in these procedures.",
