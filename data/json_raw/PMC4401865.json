            "text": "Objective: Microarray-related studies often involve a very large number of genes and small sample size. Cross-validating or bootstrapping is therefore imperative to obtain a fair assessment of the prediction/classification performance of a gene signature. A deficiency of these methods is the reduced training sample size because of the partition process in cross-validation and sampling with replacement in bootstrapping. To address this problem, we aim to obtain a prediction performance estimate that strikes a good balance between bias and variance and has a small root mean squared error. Methods: We propose to make a one-step extrapolation from the fitted learning curve to estimate the prediction/classification performance of the model trained by all the samples. Results: Simulation studies show that the method strikes a good balance between bias and variance and has a small root mean squared error. Three microarray data sets are used for demonstration. Conclusions: Our method is advocated to estimate the prediction performance of a gene signature derived from a small study. Open Access Research Contributors L-YW designed the simulation study and drafted the manuscript. W-CL conceived the study and participated in its design and coordination.",

            "text": "Microarray-based studies often involve a very large number of genes and a relatively small sample size. The same small data set being used for constructing the prediction model and subsequently evaluating the prediction performance tends to give over-optimistic estimates. This is why cross-validating or bootstrapping is imperative if a fair assessment of the prediction/classification performance of a gene signature is to be made. Popular crossvalidation (CV) methods are k-fold CV, Monte Carlo CV and leave-one-out CV (LOOCV, also known as jackknifing). 16 These methods partition the original data into a training set and a testing set. The training sample size, therefore, is reduced. The bootstrap method is an alternative to CV that operates by sampling with replacement of the original data. 17 18 Even though the bootstrap sample has the same sample size as the original one, the overlapping of subjects between the bootstrap sample and the original data still reduces the effective (non-overlapping) training sample size. The reduced training sample size will curtail the prediction/classification performance of a gene signature, especially when the sample size of a study is already small. 19 Estimating the performance of a prediction model built from a small study is a vexing task. For CV purposes, the already small sample size still needs to be partitioned further into a training set and a testing one. If we make the training size as large as possible (such as LOOCV), it would be nearly unbiased, but the effective sample size left for validation is one subject and we would get a variance that is unduly large, that is, the notorious bias-variance dilemma. 20 21 Strengths and limitations of this study \u25aa The proposed method estimates the prediction performance of a gene signature derived from a small study. \u25aa The proposed method strikes a good balance between bias and variance and has a small root mean squared error. \u25aa The proposed method can be applied to linear and non-linear prediction models. \u25aa The proposed method may not work well for studies with an extremely small sample size (eg, n<10).",

In each simulation, a total of 100 random partitions are performed for each fold CV (LOOCV, 10-fold, 5-fold, 3-fold and 2-fold CVs, respectively). From these, we use the previously described learning curve to make a one-step extrapolation to the cross-validated AUC when all the samples are utilised to train the model. For a comparison, we also calculate the internally validated AUCs of the LOO bootstrap in each simulation. This is a modified bootstrap procedure of the ordinary bootstrap. We draw a total of 100 resamplings. At each draw, the observations left out serve as the testing set. The effective (non-overlapping) training sample size of the LOO bootstrap is around 63.2% of the total sample size. 17 18 (Out-of-bag (OOB) 29 estimation employs a majority vote on the multiple prediction made for observation i based on the bootstrap samples at each draw, while the LOO bootstrap takes an average on error of these predictions. Therefore, OOB estimation may have larger variability than the LOO bootstrap when the sample size is small. 30 ) In the simulation, we additionally create a large data set of 1000 cases and 1000 controls for external validation. For a prediction model, an externally validated AUC against this data set is considered as its true AUC value (one true AUC for each round of simulation). It should be pointed out that in real practice, one rarely has the luxury to conduct such a large-scale external validation, but will often have to settle for a satisfactory internal validation method which is precisely the focal point of this paper.",

            "text": "When estimating the performance of a model derived from a small study, there seems to be no reason to settle for a sample size of N T \u00c0 1 (or N T \u00c0 2, in a leaveone-pair-out CV), since what we are looking for is the performance at sample size N T . In this study, we extrapolate the performance to N T by exploiting the linear relation between Z \u00c02 AUC and n \u00c01 1 \u00fe n \u00c01 0 . The extrapolation is based on five CV methods (LOOCV, 10-fold, 5-fold, 3-fold and 2-fold CV) and is carried out only one-step ahead. The resulting estimate thus inherits the lack of bias in LOOCV and strikes a satisfying variance among the five CV methods. A computer simulation shows that our method performs the best in terms of RMSE when sample sizes are small. The learning curve for AUC used in this study is based on a linear prediction model (online supplementary appendix 1). However, our simulation study shows that the learning curve is equally suited for non-linear prediction models, such as SVM (figure 2) and RF (online supplementary appendix 9). When making the extrapolation, we may sometimes encounter a slope (b in y \u00bc a \u00fe bx) that is near zero (eg, the colon cancer example demonstrated in figure 3). This may occur when the model performance has reached its plateau; thus, varying the training size (as in different CV methods) has little effect on AUC estimates. This can also occur at the other extreme when the prediction/ classification problem at hand is more complex and requires a much larger training size than is currently available, to significantly enhance the model performance. In either case, our method amounts to taking the average of the five CV estimates, thereby stabilising the variances.",

In this paper, we are only interested in how the performance will result if all the samples we have are utilised to train the model. We do need an equation (a learning curve) for extrapolation, but this requires extrapolating a mere one step ahead. Our results should therefore be less dependent on what learning curves are being used. Figure 3 Demonstration of the three microarray data using the proposed extrapolation method.
