            "text": "Pupillary dilatation with three types of eye drops is used regularly in the clinic; however, a mixture of these drops in a single bottle may be more beneficial in reducing workloads and resources. This study compared the efficacy in pupillary dilatation between two protocols of dilating drop instillation. Methods: This prospective, randomized, comparative study included 30 eligible Thai patients. The patients randomly received preoperative pupillary dilatations by either the conventional protocol (1% tropicamide (T), 10% phenylephrine (P) and 0.1% diclofenac (D) in three separate bottles) or the fixed combination (TPD) protocol which had the three types of eye drops mixed in a single bottle in a ratio of 4:3:3. The chi-square test and independent t-test were used to analyze the data. Results: The conventional protocol group and TPD protocol group each had 15 patients. Sixty minutes after the initial instillation, all patients in the TPD protocol and 13 patients (86.7%) in conventional protocol achieved at least 6 mm in the shortest diameter. The mydriatic rate between protocols showed no difference. In patients who received the TPD protocol, the systemic effects on the mean arterial blood pressure and pulse rate decreased over time. Conclusion: The mixture of tropicamide, phenylephrine and diclofenac had a comparable efficacy for a pupillary dilatation to the conventional dilating drops in separate bottles. The systemic complications on blood pressure and arterial pulse of the TPD mixture were less than the conventional protocol. Trial registration: TCTR20130325001."

            "text": "Pupillary dilatation is necessary for a fundus examination and ophthalmic procedures. The mydriatic agents that are generally available in the eye clinic are tropicamide and phenylephrine. For an intraocular examination or operation, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug is additionally required to prolong the mydriatic effect and lessen post-operative inflammation. 1,2 The conventional formula of pre-operative pupillary dilatation commonly used in the hospital is 1% tropicamide, 10% phenylephrine, and 0.1% diclofenac in separate bottles. Each eye-drop bottle contains preservatives to inhibit microbial contamination. However, these preservatives have been linked to unwanted ocular surface side effects, such as stinging, redness and corneal punctate epithelial erosion. A combination of preoperative eye drops in one bottle may not only reduce the frequency of multiple eye drop administrations but may also reduce the ocular and systemic complications. 3---5 There were some reports on the efficacy and safety of a combination of tropicamide and phenylephrine, 4---6 but there is no report on a combination of tropicamide, phenylephrine and diclofenac.",

This reduced concentration mixture (TPD) was labeled for the TPD protocol. A pharmacist (PA) of the hospital was responsible for the preparation of this TPD mixture. The mixture was prepared from commercially available eye drops instead of using the primary preservative-free pharmaceutical products.

Other eye drops, such as topical anesthetics, were not allowed before the study. The measurements of pupillary diameters, pulse and blood pressure were taken at baseline, 10 min, 25 min and 60 min after the first eye drop instillation of each protocol that was administered. The pupillary diameter was measured in both horizontal and vertical dimensions by an infrared pupillometer (Colvard \u00ae , OASIS Medical Inc., CA, USA) and was read by only one investigator (SS). The average of these two values was recorded for the analysis. The sitting arterial blood pressure and pulse were measured by an automatic sphygmomanometer (Spirit \u00ae , Spirit Medical Co., Ltd., Taiwan, ROC). The target pupillary size was at least 6 mm in the shortest dimension within 60 min. With a pupillary size of at least 6 mm in diameter, the fundus examination along with most intraocular operations achieved a sufficient view of the lens, retina and vitreous.   The primary outcome was a difference of the mean pupillary diameters at 60 min between the two protocols. The secondary outcomes were changes in the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and arterial pulse. A formula for the MAP calculation was [(2 \u00d7 diastolic value) + systolic value]/3.",

            "text": "In regards to the systemic effects on the MAP and pulse, phenylephrine has a sympathetic stimulation on the heart rate and, therefore, probably induces a raise of the arterial blood pressure and pulse. Each patient in the conventional protocol received 3 drops of 10% phenylephrine while each patient in the TPD protocol received 4 drops of 3% phenylephrine. Therefore, the total amount of phenylephrine in the conventional group of patients was much higher than the patients in the TPD group. This may be the reason the TPD protocol had fewer patients with cardiovascular side effects than patients who received the conventional protocol. The tendency of the mean arterial pulse to decrease over time in the TPD group may occur from a full rest of the patient with less sympathetic stimulation from the eye drops. A similar result was also reported in a previous study. 5 Therefore, the TPD protocol may be more beneficial in patients with systemic hypertension or cardiovascular diseases.",
