Methods: We did a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of maternal hospital discharges in the United States (1998-2009). We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database to identify hospital stays for women who gave birth. We determined length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and used ICD-9-CM codes to identify CCA and all outcomes of interest. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between CCA and feto-maternal outcome.",

Considering this delay in childbearing to older ages, and the association between later age at first delivery and increased risk of several types of cancer, the expectation would be an increase in the number of women with a diagnosis of cancer during pregnancy [2]. Cervical cancer is one of the leading types of reproductive cancer among pregnant mothers [3]. Recently, a study of nine Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries investigated trends of cervical cancer in the *Address correspondence to this author at the Department of Women Children and Family Health Science, College of Nursing, University of Illinois, 845 S Damen Ave, Chicago, IL 60612, USA; E-mail: talk2mulie@gmail.com United States (US) and reported an overall 54% reduction in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer over a 35-year period, from 13.07 per 100,000 (1973)(1974)(1975) to 6.0 per 100,000 (2006)(2007)  [4]. However, despite the comprehensive nature of their analyses, the authors did not look specifically at the rates and temporal trends of cervical cancer during pregnancy. Pregnancy provides a valuable opportunity to screen and diagnose women for cervical cancer as they are receiving routine antenatal care.",

These increases have been attributed largely to the aforementioned tendency for women to give birth at later ages, but also to increased detection rates due to an increased frequency of encounters with the healthcare system during pregnancy [4,6]. An analysis of delivery hospitalizations in countries like the US, where a high preponderance of deliveries occur in hospitals and other healthcare facilities [7] should provide improved estimates of the prevalence of pregnancy-associated cervical cancer. The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) series of databases, made available through the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), makes it possible to investigate national rates and temporal trends of cervical cancer among pregnancy women. Furthermore, the availability of patient and hospital-level socio-demographic and geographic characteristics such as age, race, and urbanization in the NIS can facilitate analyses that identify particular subsets of pregnant women that may be at increased risk for cervical cancer, and can serve as a proxy for assessing the effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention programs in different regions of the US.",

Each hospital discharge record contains ICD-9-CM codes for a patient's principal diagnosis and up to 14 secondary diagnoses. Beginning in 2009, the NIS included up to 24 secondary diagnosis fields [10]. Once restricted to delivery hospitalizations, we identified women with a cervical cancer diagnosis using the presence of one or more of the following ICD-9-CM codes: 180.0, 180.1, 180.8, 180.9, 233.1, and 795.06. Maternal co-morbidities and maternal-fetal outcomes, including early onset delivery and poor fetal growth, were also identified using ICD-9-CM codes.

Markup for services from actual cost to what is charged varies over time, across hospitals, and even among different departments within the same hospital [11,12]. To estimate the actual cost of direct medical care, we first multiplied the total charge of the hospitalization by a time-and hospital-specific cost-tocharge ratio (CCR) provided by HCUP [13]. Then, we multiplied reported charges by an \"adjustment factor\" (AF) from HCUP. The AF adjusts for bias that results from interdepartmental variations in markup within each hospital [14]. For example, within the same hospital, the markup for a surgical procedure may be considerably higher than for a routine bed service; the AF attempts to adjust for those differences.

Temporal trends in rates of cervical cancer during the 12-year study period were assessed using joinpoint regression. Joinpoint regression provides the best fitting model with time points where the rate changes (increase or decrease) significantly [15]. Each distinct temporal trend identified by the joinpoint model is described using the annual percent change [APC, average annual change over the years during a particular trend] and the average annual percent change [AAPC, an overall APC that characterizes the entire study period, even if there were statistically significant changes in the trend] [15].

In the second multivariable model, in addition to covariates in the first multivariate model, we also controlled for clinical and pregnancy-related complications. These complications were captured using a composite binary variable that indicated the presence or absence these conditions (see Table 2 for list of variables included in the composite variables). The individual clinical and pregnancyrelated conditions used to create the clinical and pregnancyrelated composite variables were also identified using ICD-9-CM codes. Conditions were selected based on their documented association with our outcomes of interest.",

Overall, we observed a non-significant 14.3% annual reduction in the rate from 1998 to 2001 followed by a statistically significant 4.1% (95% CI: 0.1, 8.2) annual increase from 2001 to 2009 (Fig. 1). Subgroup analysis of temporal trends by region showed a statistically significant 6.3% annual reduction in the rate of pregnancyrelated cervical cancer in the Northeast region. However, in the South and West regions there were no statistically significant trends in cervical cancer rates.  Age-specific trend analyses showed a statistically significant 10.6% (95% CI: 4.6, 16.9) annual increase in pregnancy-related cervical cancer since 2001 among women aged 20-24 years (Fig. 2). Conversely, among women 25-29 years old, there was an average 1.9% (95% CI: -4.8, -1.2) decrease in the rate during the study period. For other age groups, the rate of pregnancy-related cervical cancer was either flat over time (30-34 years), or erratic without a statistically significant trend (<20, 30-34, and 35+ years). We observed tendencies towards racial/ethnic differences in the both the rates and trends of pregnancy-related cervical cancer. There was an estimated 1.3% and 2.0% annual reduction for white-NH and black-NH, respectively (data not shown), and annual increases for Hispanics (APC=2.7%), and other-NH (APC=6.0%). Despite the differences in their point estimates, none of these trends were statistically significantly different from zero. Table 2 presents the associations between pregnancyrelated cervical cancer and selected maternal-fetal outcomes. After controlling for potential sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, and hospital-related confounders, we observed between a 51% and 95% increased odds of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with a cervical cancer diagnosis at the time of their delivery hospitalization. Women with a diagnosis of cervical cancer had 95% higher odds of being diagnosed with anxiety (95% CI= 1.11-3.42); 78% higher odds of anemia (95% CI= 1.54-2.06); and 69% higher odds of preterm labor (95% CI= 1.46-1.97) than women without cervical cancer. We also observed an increased odds of delivery by cesarean section (AOR=1.67, 95% CI= 1.46-1.90) and a prolonged hospital stay (AOR= 1.51, 95% CI= 1.30-1.76) among women pregnancy-related cervical cancer. These adverse maternal-fetal outcomes translated into differences in the mean, per hospitalization, cost of inpatient medical care between women with ($4,745) with without ($3,986) pregnancy-related cervical cancer (p<0.01), even when restricted to consideration of only the delivery hospitalization.",

Since more than 98.5% of all births in the US occur in a healthcare setting [18], analyzing a nationally representative sample of inpatient hospitalizations could provide an accurate and reliable estimate of the prevalence of pregnancy-related cervical cancer. To our knowledge, this is the largest study in the US to assess the temporal trends in cervical cancer diagnoses among delivery hospitalizations and to investigate simultaneously the associations between cervical cancer and maternal-fetal morbidities. Previous studies on cervical cancer focused on trends among all women [4,19,20] and those that studied the prevalence within a pregnant population failed to assess its association with maternal comorbidities or pregnancy outcomes [5,[21][22][23]. The findings of this study contribute significantly to the literature by providing a basis for establishing recent rates and trends of pregnancy-related cervical cancer, assessing the increased risk for adverse outcomes that may be imposed by cervical cancer during pregnancy, and how that translates into differences in the direct medical costs associated with inpatient care at delivery.",

This is consistent a large study in Denmark that reported a trend of increasing prevalence of cervical cancer among pregnant mothers over the past 30 years (crude APC=0.8%; 95% CI: -0.6 to 2.1) [5]. Considering the near universal availability of screening and vaccination programs in the US, the increasing trend in pregnancy-related cervical cancer is of concern. One possible explanation for our findings may be a product of the limitation of the NIS datathe unit of analysis is a single discharge record, and discharges for the same woman cannot be linked together. Therefore, there is a potential for counting a diagnosis of cervical cancer for a woman multiple times. To increase the likelihood that a cervical cancer diagnosis for a particular woman (or for a particular pregnancy) is only counted once, we restricted our analyses to delivery hospitalizations. By broadening our scope to include all pregnancy-related discharge records, we would probably improve slightly our ability to capture cases of cervical cancer, but would very likely overestimate the prevalence of pregnancy-related cervical cancer due to the aforementioned consequence of multiple counting. Another plausible explanation for the increasing trend is that because of an increased frequency of medical encounters during pregnancy (e.g. antenatal care visits) women are more likely to have better awareness and consent to screening [4,6]. One may also speculate that the increasing trend could be because of the concomitant increase in human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Since our data do not provide information on HPV infection, we analyzed the prevalence and trends of a broader group of STI infections [24,25]. As hypothesized, we observed an 11.2% [95% CI= 9.2-13.3] annual increase in the prevalence of STIs from 2000-2009, which could, in part, explain the 4.1% average annual increase in the pregnancy-related cervical cancer rate from 2001-2009.",

In assessing geographic differences, we attempted to adjust for patient and hospital characteristics; however, some residual confounding may persist and explain some of those findings. Stratified trend analyses by age demonstrated 10.6% and 3.5% annual increases for women 20-25 years and \u2265 35 years of age respectively. The former peak (20-25 years) could be related to women becoming sexually active in their early teens [32] increasing the risk of being infected with HPV, a critical factor for cervical cancer [33]. The increasing rates observed among women of advanced maternal age (age \u2265 35 years) could be due to the increased risk associated with having a first pregnancy later in life [34]. Unfortunately, neither parity nor time at first delivery is available in the NIS; therefore, we could not further investigate this hypothesis.",

The increased level of anxiety for a woman diagnosed with cervical cancer is likely due to increased concern for existential well-being of herself and her baby [38,39]. Anemia is one of the major complications of many cancers [40], and impacts more than 40% of cancer patients [41]. It is established that women who are anemic during pregnancy are more likely to give birth to a preterm infant [42,43]. In our study, women with cervical cancer were 95% more likely to be diagnosed with anemia. Therefore, the observed increased risk of preterm birth among infants born to women with cervical cancer could be explained partly by the higher prevalence of anemia among cervical cancer patients [35,44].",

First, because of the administrative nature of the NIS data, we relied on ICD-9-CM codes to identify cases of cervical cancer, clinical and pregnancy-related comorbidities, and behavioral conditions. These data are subject to errors in coding, which could lead to over-or under estimation of cases and other comorbidities. Second, it is possible that women with a cervical cancer diagnosis during pregnancy could receive more thorough assessment, follow-up, and extensive documentation of behavioral and clinical comorbidities compared to other pregnant women, which could lead to a diagnostic bias that results in differential misclassification and an overestimation of the measures of associations we report. Third, some states do not report race/ethnicity data (25% of discharges in this study were missing race/ethnicity), and the states that do categorize race/ethnicity do so in a non-uniform manner. HCUP attempts to standardize categorization of race/ethnicity to enabling comparisons but one should still interpret those findings with caution. Despite these known limitations of the NIS dataset, the large and representative sample of inpatient hospital discharges affords an efficient means of generating national estimates of pregnancy-related cervical cancer rates and trends. The substantial sample size also permitted our investigation of trends within geographic region and sociodemographic subgroups.",
