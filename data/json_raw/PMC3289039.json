            "text": "Vertebrate and invertebrate colour pattern determination mechanisms are considered distinct; recently, however, both fish and butterfly colour patterns have been partly explained by reaction-diffusion mechanisms. Here, we show that multi-coloured eyespots of the spotted mandarin fish, which are reminiscent of butterfly eyespots, are determined by the serial induction of colour patterns. The morphological characterisation of eyespots indicates a sequence of colour pattern development and dynamic interactions between eyespots. A substantial part of an eyespot can be surgically removed and is then reconstructed by regeneration. Strikingly, ectopic patterns are induced by damage at a background (eyespotless) area, but focal damage did not change the eyespot size. Early stages of damage repair were accompanied by calcium oscillations. These results demonstrate that fish eyespots are determined by serial induction, which is likely based on a reaction-diffusion mechanism. These findings suggest mechanistic similarities between the fish and butterfly systems."

            "text": "ivid colour patterns are widespread in the animal kingdom. Two notable examples are tropical fish and insect body surface patterns. Fish skin colour patterns are very diverse and are often variable even among individuals of a given species. Their complex colour patterns can mostly be explained by reaction-diffusion models [1][2][3] , the basis of which is the activator-inhibitor system of short-range self-activation and long-range inhibition 4,5 . In contrast, insect body surface patterns are usually species-specific. Recent studies revealed that the black spots on the wings of Drosophila species are controlled by the spatially specified expression of certain genes 6,7 . Similarly, in butterflies, some specific genes are expressed in specific locations in developing wings 8,9 ; thus, overall patterns are largely species-specific. A general colour pattern of butterfly wings is known as the nymphalid groundplan [10][11][12] , in which several eyespots are regularly aligned. These observations suggest that the colour patterns of insects including butterflies are ''fixed'' and that their developmental determination mechanisms are different from those of fish colour patterns. Indeed, butterfly eyespots have long been explained by the concentration gradient model for positional information 8,10,11,[13][14][15][16] .",

Although mechanisms for determining fish skin colour patterns have been well studied [1][2][3][20][21][22][23][24][25][26] , the previous studies of fish patterns have focused on stripes or random dots, not including eyespots, and there are no experimental results that have directly compared fish eyespots with the butterfly wing colour pattern system.",

The width of the blue ring also correlates with the whole eyespot size in the D1 eyespot (r 5 0.78; Fig. 2a) but not in the D2 eyespot (r 5 0.27; Fig. 2b); this is probably because the D1 eyespot is smaller than the D2 eyespot. Black and orange rings do not show significant correlation coefficients either in the D1 eyespot or the D2 eyespot (r # 4.0; n 5 14). Thus, these rings are relatively constant over the wide range of eyespot size after a certain width is attained, and the core may enlarge the whole structure of an eyespot (also see Fig. 3d-f).",

In these miniature eyespots, the core is orange and is encircled by a narrow black ring. These miniature eyespots do not have a black core. A blue ring is also usually found outside the black ring. However, most of these miniature eyespots are not completely circular and are incomplete or partial eyespots. Indeed, some have only an orange core. Interestingly, a pair of right and left miniature eyespots is often symmetrical in both position and morphology ( Fig. 3h, j).

To observe how eyespots are reconstructed during skin regeneration, we surgically removed a portion of skin containing a significant portion of an eyespot (Fig. 4). In all the cases in which the ''more-than-half'' removal protocol was used (n 5 5), most areas regenerated. In the first case shown here, the black core and other portions of an eyespot were removed, the orange and black rings expanded to the wound area, and a blue area was regenerated around it ( Fig. 4a). This demonstrates that the black core is not required for the reconstruction of the entire eyespot. Following the closure of the blue and black rings, a black core emerged. Additionally, a blurred blue area was induced along the cut edge, and small ectopic orange cores emerged at irregular positions. In the second sample from the ''morethan-half'' removal protocol, remnant blue and black rings appeared to behave as seeds for colour patterns (Fig. 4b). An orange area was induced in the positions enclosed by the black areas.",

In all of these cases, some remnants remained, but they appeared to be deconstructed first before small patches of blue areas appeared, which were associated with narrow black areas (Fig. 4c). These black areas then induced adjacent orange areas. The removal of a portion of background area (n 5 6) similarly induced small patches of blue areas that were accompanied by small black areas in all the cases ( Fig. 4d, e). An orange area was then induced adjacent to the black area. In these samples, a black ring encircled the blue patch, but the black area was wider on one side; therefore, there is an apparent polarity in the development of the black area. It appeared that the side facing other blue areas developed wide black areas despite that there is no apparent physical interactions between remote blue areas. No ectopic eyespots were observed between D7L and S6L in the same fish. (d) Asymmetric dorsal eyespots. D4R is smaller than D4L, whereas D5R is larger than D5L. (e) Morphometric analysis of the D4 and D5 eyespots of the fish shown in d. Blue, black, and orange rings are similar in width in both L and R eyespots, but the core diameter is not. Whole eyespots and cores are shown as diameters at the largest end along the anterior-posterior axis. (f) Quantitative size relationships among the D4 and D5 eyespots. The right eyespots shown here are unusual in that the D4 eyespot is smaller (arrow), and the D5 eyespot is larger (arrowhead) than the typical eyespots in the same positions. The D4 and D5 left eyespots are similar in size. Eyespot diameters are measured at the larger end along the anterior-posterior axis. ''Gap'' indicates the edge-to-edge distance between the D4 and D5 eyespots. (g) Lateral view of a fish that has many miniature eyespots of various shapes. (h) Dorsal view of the same fish. (i) High magnification of the lateral view shown in g. All the miniature eyespots are incomplete eyespots. Some eyespots display a core orange area surrounded by very narrow black and blue rings (white arrows). Others have a core orange area surrounded by distinct black and blue rings, but these rings are not closed (black arrows). (j) High magnification of the D2 eyespot with nearby miniature eyespots. Two miniature eyespots are located symmetrically and are symmetrical in shape (arrows). Ectopic eyespots induced by physical damage. We damaged fish skin using a heated needle on a background (eyespotless) area (n 5 23). In 9 out of 23 cases, ectopic colour patterns developed. In the first sample, small patches of blue areas appeared first in the damaged area (Fig. 5a, b). Then, black areas were induced along these blue areas, but there was an apparent polarity in the black induction. Later, orange areas were induced. As a result, bar-like tri-colour bands were often observed. Intriguingly, the orange area induced by the bar-like blue and black areas became circular, and light black and blue rings were observed around the orange area. It appears that an orange area has an intrinsic ability to form a circular pattern. In a second sample, damage to the background (eyespotless) area caused the rings of an adjacent eyespot to open (Fig. 5c), and it appeared that black cells were supplied from the open black ring to the damaged area. These black cells were present around the damaged site for a few days; subsequently, they disappeared. In addition, a small blue patch was ''pinched off '' from the blue ring of another eyespot. A black ring encircled the blue area, but the black area was wider at the side that faced the open eyespot.",

These cells may correspond to pigment cells or related cells that move towards the damaged site, as was observed in the previous damage experiments. They were observed to continue fluorescing when they had stopped moving at a given position (Fig. 6c, e). It is likely that these regions correspond to the prospective blue areas. Similarly, fluorescent cells were observed along the edges of isolated tissues (not shown). Importantly, calcium oscillations with 7-8 min cycles were observed. These oscillations may be synchronised to some extent among the damaged cells (Fig. 6f).",

In a mandarin fish eyespot, we observed black cores of various widths and blue, black, and orange rings of relatively constant widths. Furthermore, a very thin black ring (eB ring) and a blurred orange ring (eO ring) were observed outside the blue ring. Larger eyespots had larger black cores, and in relatively small eyespots, the width of the blue ring also correlated with the size of the whole eyespot. Thus, large and small eyespots are structurally different in mandarin fish. When focusing on the three black areas (i.e., black core, black ring, and eB ring) and disregarding the blue and orange rings, it was observed that the black area is narrower as it is located farther from the focus. This was also observed in butterfly eyespots and is called the inside-wide rule. In contrast, large ray eyespots are similar to an enlarged ''photocopy'' of small eyespots. The ray eyespots are probably ''fixed'' in the early stage of development because they are similar to the miniature eyespots of the mandarin fish in that the core is orange in colour."

In addition, a morphometric analysis of irregular eyespots suggests that two eyespots may repel each other. The fact that miniature eyespots are located in the farthest positions from the regular eyespots could also be explained by repelling interactions. These dynamic interactions may be mediated through the so-called ''imaginary rings'' (including but not limited to eB and eO rings) that are observed in the outermost positions of an eyespot and that are usually invisible or very ambiguous. Alternatively, a concept of developmental field may be suitable. The symmetric positioning of the miniature eyespots suggests that the developmental field is also symmetrical in the right and left sides of the body. These two types of interactions do not necessarily require physical contact between parts of eyespots and are likely to be two important interactions that govern the global colour patterns, which are similar to those found in butterflies 19 .",

Hence, the orange area appears to play a critical role in the initial positioning of the circular pattern. It is likely that other rings are serially induced around the orange core as the whole eyespot size increases. The induced rings increase in width to a certain limit, after which they stay at a constant width. At a critical size for the whole eyespot, the black core emerges in the middle of the orange area.",

After damage to a background area, a blue area was generated first in most cases. A black area was then induced adjacent to the pre-formed blue area, but the wide black area was formed on only one side. The black induction is ''polarised''. This black area then induced an orange area. It appears that the orange area has an intrinsic ability to form a circular pattern. This process does not follow the possible developmental sequence. However, in different cases, an orange area emerged first. The fact that either direction of developmental induction is possible suggests mutual stabilisation between rings of different colours, as observed in the butterfly system 17,18 .

The hindwing eyespots are not reduced in size in response to damage, and other homologous elements also do not respond to damage 17 . In butterflies, the forewing damage that leads to reduced eyespot sizes may cause the extensive removal of positionspecifying or signal-generating cells; therefore, such experiments do not necessarily support the conventional gradient model for positional information 17,18 .

However, multi-coloured eyespots are also common in butterflies. Second, there is no white focus in fish eyespots, but this white focus is usually present in butterflies. However, there are many butterfly eyespots that lack white foci. Third, miniature eyespots can be incomplete in shape, and a simple band instead of a ring can be formed in fish. Similarly, bar-like or dotlike blue and black bands are induced first in the case of artificial induction. These structures are different from typical butterfly eyespots, but they are similar in shape to partial or ''immature'' eyespots 16 and parafocal elements 12 .

We observed mobile cells that exhibit calcium signals around the damaged area where the future colour pattern appears. At least some of these cells displayed fluorescent clusters on their cell membrane, indicating cellular interactions, and several of these cells displayed calcium oscillations. It is reasonable to hypothesise that calcium signals play an important role in skin regeneration and in the induction of colour patterns. Calcium-inducible genes may be responsible for wound healing and colour pattern signalling processes.",

The present study demonstrates that mandarin fish eyespot structures are determined by dynamic interactions between colour-specifying signals. Serial induction powered by short-range activation and long-range inhibition 4,5 is likely appropriate for describing the developmental dynamics of this fish system and is probably applicable to the butterfly system [17][18][19] .",

Quantitative measurements of size and distance were performed using ImageJ 28 and graphically presented and analysed using Microsoft Excel. Eyespot diameter and the width of a given ring and core were measured along the line that passes through the focus of that eyespot for the mandarin fish.

For the skin removal operations, a fish was soaked in ice-cold seawater to result in deep general anaesthesia and an area of skin was quickly detached using fine razor blades. The operated individuals were allowed to recover naturally, and pictures were taken as frequently as possible during the recovery process. Three types of detachment surgery protocols were performed: the entire removal of an eyespot (n 5 5), a morethan-half removal of an eyespot portion (n 5 5), and the removal of a background area (n 5 6). In all cases (n 5 16 in total), the operated individual survived and removed skin portions were regenerated.

Fluo-4 AM was allowed to enter the cells for 20 min, and the tissue was then washed in PBS. The tissue was sandwiched by two thin glasses in PBS and observed. The real-time confocal microscope imaging system used in this study was composed of an inverted epifluorescence microscope Eclipse Ti-U (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), a CSU-X1 laserscanning unit with a 520612.5 nm band-pass filter (Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan), and an ImagEM EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan).
