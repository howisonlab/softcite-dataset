Imprinted nanoparticles were prepared by the inverse microemulsion polymerization method. A fraction of Lpp20, an outer membrane protein of H. pylori known as NQA, was chosen as template and modified with myristic acid to facilitate its localization on the surface of the nanoparticles. The interaction between these SMINs with the template NQA were evaluated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), change in zeta potential and fluorescence polarization (FP). The results were highly consistent in demonstrating a preferential recognition of the template NQA for SMINs compared with the control nanoparticles. In vitro experiments also indicate that such SMINs are able to adhere to H. pylori and may be useful for H. pylori eradication.",

            "text": "During recent decades, mucoadhesive drug delivery systems (MDDS) for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication have been frequently reported. The ability of MDDS to adhere to the mucus layer prolongs their retention time in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby enables the loaded drug to interact with H. pylori for a longer time. However, this non-specific adhesion is affected not only by varying turnover time and composition of mucus but also by how the mucoadhesive polymer used to make MDDS responds to changes in pH and physiological or disease conditions. Such variability seriously limits the application of this technique 1 . This paper reports the results of an investigation into the preparation and characterization of surface molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (SMINs) designed to bind to H. pylori.",

            "text": "Molecular imprinting involves the synthesis of polymers in the presence of a template molecule. The process produces polymers with surface binding sites that complement those of the template in terms of its size, shape and functional group orientation 2 . Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have been widely recognized as promising alternatives to enzymes, antibodies and natural receptors due to their specificity, robustness and reusability 3 . However, most of the successful examples are imprinted with low molecular weight compounds while imprinting with larger molecules such as peptides and proteins, or with complex systems such as viruses and cells is still in its infancy. According to Kryscio et al. 4 , it is now evident that the general design principles of low molecular weight MIPs do not apply to the macromolecular regime. The monomers commonly employed in MIPs significantly alter the template conformation prior to polymerization and compromise the specific recognition of the template.",

In bulk imprinting, the binding sites of the template proteins tend to be restricted within the polymer matrix and are only exposed by grinding the matrix.

In our laboratory, an exposed antigenic domain of Lpp20 (amino acids 83-115 from the N-terminus, abbreviated as NQA) was imprinted on the surface of nanoparticles. According to research by our group 8 and Zeng et al. 5 , \"surface imprinting\" is more likely to be achieved during an inverse mini-emulsion polymerization process when the template molecules are amphiphilic. Based on this consideration, the hydrophilic NQA was modified with a long hydrocarbon tail (from myristic acid (Myr)) and used as the template to imprint surface capture sites for the entire Lpp20 lipoprotein. Such an epitope imprinting strategy has been previously used to capture Staphylococus aureus [9][10][11] .",

Compared to the conventional approach, the products of these newer techniques possess higher adsorption capacity due to their increased surface area. However, they are still deficient, because protein molecules are mostly hydrophilic and randomly distributed in the aqueous monomer solution, the majority of protein is restricted in the polymeric matrix and inaccessible to the template. To solve this problem, we employed inverse microemulsion polymerization as proposed by Zeng et al. 5 and modified the hydrophilic NQA with the long-chain fatty acid, myristic acid, to form an amphiphilic molecule. During the emulsion process, the amphiphilic template functions as a surfactant and arranges itself at the oil-water interface with its hydrophilic head protruding into the aqueous phase and its hydrophobic tail oriented outwards. This was anticipated to promote interaction between the hydrophilic peptide and the monomer and also create imprints directly at or near the surface of the nanoparticles. The template should then have easy access to surface specific sites as found in the natural immune response where only the surface epitope part of a macromolecule is recognized by the antibody 2 . The preparation procedure is summarized in Scheme 1.",

Thus injection of suspensions with the three higher concentrations (2.22, 6.67 and 20 mg/mL) led to particularly high levels of RU whereas signals for nanoparticle suspensions with lower concentrations were less significant. This indicates that, at higher concentrations, the presence of a large number of high-affinity binding sites on the surface of Myr-NQA-MINs offers more opportunity for rapid adsorption of template molecules. NQA-MINs did not seem to interact strongly with immobilized template at any concentration and its sensorgram was quite similar to that of NINs. This was probably because the absence of surface imprints prevented them from effectively interacting with the template molecules. These results indicate the successful fabrication of specifically imprinted cavities on the surface of Myr-NQA-MINs.",

As shown in Fig. 4, at low concentrations of nanoparticles (0.78 and 1.56 \u03bcg/mL), FP of Myr-NQA-MINs after incubation with FAM labeled template was significantly higher than FP of NQA-MINs and NINs. This can be attributed to the higher affinity of Myr-NQA-MINs for template molecules. However, at higher concentrations of nanoparticles (100 and 200 \u03bcg/mL), there were no significant differences in FP of the three types of nanoparticles. This is presumably because in all cases the majority of template molecules are adsorbed onto the nanoparticles due to both specific and nonspecific interactions and the greater affinity of Myr-NQA-MINs for template is masked.",
