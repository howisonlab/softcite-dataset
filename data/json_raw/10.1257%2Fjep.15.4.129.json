            "text": "hen an applied econometrician calculates regression coefficients or other statistics based on a data sample, there is a moment of truth when the statistical precision or reliability of the estimates is evaluated using critical values of relevant probability distributions. If statistical precision is underestimated, producing confidence intervals that are too wide, the researcher may falsely conclude that no useful or reliable evidence has been provided. Since statistically imprecise results often are regarded as noninformative and may never see the light of day, applied econometricians have a strong incentive to obtain tight confidence bands. But overestimation of statistical precision also is a concern, as it potentially causes rejection of a null hypothesis when in fact no statistically reliable evidence has been presented. Such results are misleading and provide poor guidance for future research and perhaps public policy as well. This article describes two techniques that have been developed by statisticians in the last 20 years to enhance the accuracy of estimated confidence bands and critical values: the bootstrap and multiple imputations. These are computationally intensive methods that rely on repeated sampling from empirical data sets and associated estimates. As such, their development and dissemination have been supported by substantial increases in computing power over the same period. These techniques often can provide accurate estimates of statistical precision when standard analytical estimates are biased or, in some cases, unavailable. Both already"

            "text": "The application of the bootstrap to linear regression models is similar to the sample mean case above, although several different approaches are possible. The most popular way to implement the bootstrap to estimate the sampling distribution of the least squares coefficient estimators is the XY, or paired bootstrap. Using this approach, with an observed sample of size N, randomly draw N complete data points with replacement from the observed sample (or, in other words, sample rows of the data matrix). Then recompute the least squares estimator for each bootstrap sample. This produces a different estimate of the coefficients for each repetition. The distribution of the resulting set of estimated coefficients is an estimate of their sampling distribution. Whether the error terms are homoskedastic or heteroskedastic, the paired bootstrap will generate consistent estimates of the sampling distribution of the least squares estimator. Brownstone and Kazimi (2000), Efron and Tibshirani (1993), Horowitz (2001) and Jeong and Maddala (1993) provide more complete applied discussions of this and other bootstrap procedures, including details regarding hypothesis tests and confidence intervals based on the bootstrapped estimates. 1 Horowitz (1997) points out that the different nature of the bootstrap approximation provides a rough check on the adequacy of large-sample theory. If the assumptions commonly made for large-sample econometrics hold-for example, residuals that are independent and distributed identically with finite variancethen the bootstrap and standard methods used in econometric software packages should yield the same answers. If significant departures from these assumptions are present, then one or both of the methods are not reliable for the particular problem and data. Deciding between them requires more detailed analysis, which explains why much of the ongoing research on the bootstrap is based on simulations rather than on empirical data sets.",

The dependent variable is the log of yearly earnings, deflated by the GDP deflator for personal consumption expenditure. We report coefficient estimates for the following explanatory variables: years of formal education, potential labor market experience (and its square), and tenure at the current firm, along with dummy variables indicating whether the respondent is a union member, black, married and resides in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). We also included a constant and dummy variables representing region of residence and observation years. The data are drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for the years 1984 -1993. We restricted the sample to male household heads, aged 21-64 and employed in the private sector (excluding self-employed individuals). We report results based on a 2 percent random sample of individuals observed at any time in the panel (260 observations on 50 individuals), since in large samples all the procedures give the same results. Using a small subsample also allows us to simulate the true sampling distribution by drawing many independent subsamples of 50 individuals from the data and reestimating the model for each subsample. This simulation uses the original PSID sample of 2,789 individuals (16,327 panel observations) to approximate the true population of anybody who could have been sampled by the PSID. Table 1 presents results for the male wage equation. The estimated regression coefficients are listed in the second column. The next column gives the true confidence intervals calculated from 1000 independent subsamples of 50 individuals from the data. These are the true confidence intervals if the PSID main sample is identical to the population. If the PSID main sample is only an approximation of the true population, then these \"true\" confidence intervals are bootstrap intervals with bootstrap sample size much smaller than the data. It is, of course, more efficient to use the entire sample in this case, but we are only interested in using these intervals as a benchmark for comparing results based on only one subsample.",

The robust estimator of sampling variance does not require homoskedasticity-that the errors in the regression model have constant variance. Instead, the Huber-White estimator approximates the variance of each residual by the square of the least squares residual. We use a generalization of the Huber-White estimator that also allows for the residuals to be correlated across time for a given individual. In the example in Table 1, the confidence intervals from the robust regression are noticeably wider than the ordinary least squares confidence intervals, which suggests that heteroskedasticity or a similar departure from the common assumptions used in applying ordinary least squares is present.",

Although standard errors can be reliably estimated with fewer repetitions (on the order of 100), confidence intervals directly based on the bootstrap distribution will be more accurate than those based on standard errors if the bootstrap distribution is skewed. Once the repetitions were completed, we obtained the 95 percent confidence intervals through the simple \"percentile method\"-by setting them equal to the values corresponding to the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the bootstrap distributions of the estimated coefficients. 3  For the final column, we used a different bootstrap approach due to Wu (1986), known as the \"wild bootstrap.\" First, run an ordinary least squares regression, and save the residuals. Then multiply each value of the residual by a random variable that takes on one of two values: i) (1 \u03ea \u034c 5)/2 with probability (1 \u03e9 \u034c 5)/(2 \u034c 5); or ii) (1 \u03e9 \u034c 5)/2 with probability 1 \u03ea (1 \u03e9 \u034c 5)/(2 \u034c 5). Note that this random variable has a mean of zero with variance equal to one. The resulting bootstrap residuals therefore will have mean zero and variance equal to the square of the least squares residual for that observation, which is identical to the approximation used to calculate Huber-White robust standard errors. The resampled residual vector is then added to the predicted value from the original regression to create the resampled dependent variable. We modified the wild bootstrap to account for the panel data structure of our data by multiplying the entire vector of residuals for each individual by the same draw of the two-point random variable defined above. The wild bootstrap confidence intervals reported in the table are based on the calculation of t-statistics using the Huber-White robust standard errors for each bootstrap sample. This method should be superior to simple percentile method intervals in small samples (for details, see Brownstone and Kazimi, 2000; Horowitz, 2001). Both paired bootstrapping and wild bootstrapping will provide consistent inference with heteroskedasticity, but wild bootstrapping generally will be more accurate, since, unlike the paired bootstrap, it imposes a restriction on each bootstrap sample that is identical to the conditions used to identify the ordinary least squares model. 4 The least squares confidence intervals in Table 1 are much narrower than the true bands. The other confidence intervals are usually narrower than the true bands, but not for all of the coefficients. The confidence intervals based on the paired bootstrap are somewhat wider than the robust confidence intervals. In contrast, the wild bootstrap confidence intervals are narrower than the paired bootstrap intervals and are close to the robust intervals in width. The bootstrap intervals are closer to the truth for six of the eight coefficients in Table 1, although the theoretical superiority of the wild bootstrap bands is not clear from this example. Of course, the results in Table 1 are just based on one subsample from the PSID, and the differences between the bootstrap and robust regression intervals are not large. Most of the studies finding large differences between the bootstrap and standard methods have used nonlinear models and more complex estimators (Horowitz, 1997; 2001).",

Any of the bootstrapping methods discussed above for the linear regression model can be applied to the nonlinear regression model, with the caveat that bootstrapped residuals must be adjusted to insure that their mean is zero. In the standard analytic approach, obtaining the sampling distribution of nonlinear regression estimates relies on a linear approximation to the regression function. Because bootstrap methods evaluate the appropriate transformations by simulation rather than approximation, we would expect bootstrap estimates of the sampling distribution to be more accurate than the standard analytic estimates as the linear approximation becomes less accurate. Horowitz (2001, section 5.3) verified this in a small simulation study of a particular nonlinear regression model. 5 In time series models, error terms are often serially correlated, and this requires bootstrap approaches that differ from the cross-section case. The simplest approach, called model-based bootstrapping, is to assume that the time series can be fit by an appropriate autoregressive moving average model with serially uncorrelated residuals. Then the bootstrap can be implemented using bootstrap approaches that take samples from the residuals of a regression (as discussed in more detail in footnote 1), although the method of generating the bootstrap samples from these bootstrapped residuals needs to be modified to account for the dynamic nature of the time series model. 6 Similarly, in panel data settings, the bootstrap must be modified to account for time dependence for observations within crosssection units-for example, through bootstrap sampling of the complete set of observations for cross-section units (Ziliak, 1997).",

This survey focuses on household finances, a subject for which responses are sensitive and often defined imprecisely. As a result, the survey exhibits high rates of missing information. Fed analysts have developed and implemented a complex iterative imputation procedure for continuous, multinomial and binary variables. The imputation model relies on the publicly available survey information concerning consumer income and wealth, combined with confidential information such as census tract characteristics and industry and occupation characteristics tabulated from the Current Population Survey of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although these multiply imputed data have been used successfully by many researchers, Kennickell reports frequent misuse and notes that \"the need for education is great.\" 8 Multiple imputations have been used less in specific applications than in general data provision. However, Brownstone and Valletta (1996) extended the basic approach to the specific application of correcting for measurement error in the dependent variable in earnings regression equations. 9 Research on earnings data, which compares surveyed earnings responses to validated earnings data gathered through company personnel files or Social Security records, has shown that measurement error in survey earnings is large and correlated with important explanatory variables (for example, Bound et al., 1994; Bound and Krueger, 1991; and Duncan and Hill, 1985).

We also found that measurement error in earnings appears to pose more significant problems during recessionary periods than expansionary periods, probably because errors in reported earnings are based largely on misperceptions of hours worked. Moreover, the standard errors in the earnings equations typically were increased by the multiple imputation procedure, because the procedure correctly accounts for sampling error that is ignored in analyses that treat earnings as an error-free variable.

This vision is tempting, especially given the ease and speed with which bootstrap estimates for many models can be obtained using modern desktop computers. However, Manski (1996) argues that this vision is flawed due to the inherent ambiguity of statistical theory in comparing alternative estimation procedures. Moreover, the current state of the art in bootstrap methods cannot support such universal application because the necessary evidence regarding bootstrap superiority (or even consistency) is not available for many classes of models. At this point, however, the bootstrap can effectively serve the less grandiose but very practical purpose of deriving better confidence bands in models characterized by deviations from a variety of assumptions commonly made in least squares analysis.",

            "text": "Here are two other common ways to implement the bootstrap in this case. In a nonparametric residual bootstrap, first estimate an ordinary least squares regression equation and then sample from the residuals; in this case, the bootstrap distribution will be the empirical distribution function of the least squares residuals. In a parametric residual bootstrap, one again generates a resampled residual vector, but the sampling is done independently from a standard normal distribution. The parametric approach is consistent only if the error terms follow a normal distribution, in which case it yields the most accurate estimates. The nonparametric approach provides consistent estimates as long as the errors are homoskedastic. Neither the parametric nor the nonparametric approach provides consistent estimates if the true errors are heteroskedastic, whereas the paired approach described in the text does.2 We are referring here to \"asymptotically pivotal\" statistics, whose asymptotic distributions do not depend on unknown population parameters; see Horowitz (2001) for discussion.",
