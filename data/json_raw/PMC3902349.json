For example, there is recent evidence that coronary CT angiography (CCTA) combined with routine clinical assessment may provide added prognostic value in the management of chest pain patients in the ED. [3][4][5][6][7][8] Use of Strengths and limitations of this study \u25aa The study suggests that a technically straightforward and cost-effective test, with minimal patient risk, may serve as a useful adjunct to the current, standard emergency department practices for the rule-out of acute coronary syndromes. Importantly, the results are generalisable: the observation of a higher incidence of prolonged closure times in patients with non-cardiac symptoms was seen in participants from two distinct healthcare systems and populations. \u25aa Platelet Function Analyzer-100 testing will only contribute to the identification of a subset of patients with non-cardiac symptoms, with the size of the subset and the potential value of the test dependent on the threshold used to define the 'prolonged' closure times. \u25aa Limitations of this pilot study include the enrolment of patients via convenience sampling, the fact that patient outcomes were not monitored beyond hospital discharge and that a risk/benefit analysis was not included in the study design.",

Rather than quantifying molecular markers of platelet activation-aggregation, the output of the PFA-100 is the 'closure time': that is, the time required for whole blood, aspirated under high shear, to occlude a small, 150 \u03bcm aperture in a membrane coated with standard platelet agonists (collagen-ADP or collagen-epinephrine). Although the PFA-100 is typically utilised to investigate the responsiveness of patients to aspirin and other antiplatelet therapies and aid in the detection of platelet dysfunction, 11 12 18-22 , there is evidence to suggest that shortened closure times may be a marker of the acuity of coronary disease. 10 Accordingly, our primary aims in this pilot study were to determine whether point-of-care testing of platelet function: (1) may assist in the rule-out of ACS; (2) may yield additional predictive value in identifying patients with non-cardiac symptoms versus ACS-positive patients and (3) is logistically feasible in an emergent setting. In addition, as a secondary analysis, we investigated whether the closure time may be of value in discriminating between ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/unstable angina (UA).",

An additional five participants were removed from analysis because exclusion criteria were identified after consent was obtained (n=4), or consent was revoked after the blood sample was collected (n=1). For the remaining 443 patients in whom the closure time was quantified, 8 were diagnosed with thrombotic events that were non-cardiac in origin and thus were excluded from further analysis.

            "text": "The results of our pilot study are consistent with the hypothesis that point-of-care testing of platelet reactivity may assist in the timely rule-out of ACS in the ED. Strengths of this approach include the fact that the assessment of closure time is technically straightforward and cost effective, with minimal patient risk (ie, does not involve exposure to radiation or additional invasive testing). In addition, our data suggest that the concept is generalisable. We observed significant differences in demographics (age and gender), the prevalence of specific risk factors (diabetes, smoking) and the use of antiplatelet therapy (aspirin: table 4) between UMASS and Cordoba-findings that are in agreement with the published reports focused on Argentine cohorts, 30 31 42 and may underlie the robust contribution of study site as a predictor of outcome in our logistic regression model. Nonetheless, our results, obtained from two distinct healthcare systems and populations, consistently revealed a higher proportion of prolonged closure times in patients with non-cardiac symptoms. There is, however, an important caveat to this strategy. PFA testing will only contribute to the identification of a subset of patients with non-cardiac symptoms, with the size of the subset and the potential value of the test dependent on the threshold used to define 'prolonged' closure times (figure 2 and table 6). For example, the prospective and arbitrary criterion used in our analysis (the 90th centile of closure times for all patients enrolled in the study) discerned an arguably modest 12.4% of patients with a diagnosis of non-cardiac symptoms. However, expediting the discharge of even a small proportion of patients with a non-cardiac diagnosis would limit the costs, potential risks and patient stress associated with unneeded advanced diagnostic testing and possibly invasive procedures. 1 2 Reducing the threshold (ie, to the 80th centile of the distribution) would   increase the size of the subset identified as ACS negative, with an accompanying (and increasingly unacceptable) loss in specificity because of the growing proportion of false positives (ACS-positive patients with prolonged closure times: figure 2 and table 6). In contrast, increasing the threshold (ie, to the 95th centile) would identify a diminishing proportion of patients with non-cardiac symptoms with an increasing specificity (figure 2 and table 6). The appropriate definition of 'prolonged' closure time will therefore require refinement based on risk/benefit analysis. Finally, we emphasise that point-of-case assessment of platelet reactivity and identification of patients with 'prolonged' closure times clearly cannot function as a stand-alone test for the rule-out of ACS. Rather, measurement of PFA closure times may serve as an adjunct to the current, standard ED practices. In support of this concept, our multivariate logistic regression model revealed that, irrespective of the TIMI score and study site (and, thus, irrespective of differences in demographics and aspirin use between sites), closure time was an independent predictor of the diagnosis of non-cardiac symptoms.",

In addition, neither monitoring of patient outcomes beyond hospital discharge (raising the possibility of potential misclassification of some patients) nor risk/benefit analysis of PFA testing was incorporated into the study design. We emphasise that point-of-care assessment of platelet reactivity cannot serve as a stand-alone test to either discern patients with non-cardiac symptoms versus ACS-positive patients or distinguish between STEMI versus NSTEMI/UA in the emergent setting-limitations that in all likelihood reflect the complex and multifactorial pathophysiology of acute myocardial ischaemia and infarction. Rather, our results suggest that the assessment of closure times may provide benefit by augmenting the standard ED diagnostic practices, a concept that warrants further large-scale multicentre investigation.
