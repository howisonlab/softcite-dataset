            "text": "Estrogens play important roles in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including carcinogenesis in estrogen targeted organs. Accordingly, estrogen receptors (ER), as mediator of estrogenic effect, are linked to diverse carcinomas as diagnostic marker and prognostic factor. In this regard, the clinical application of ER\u03b1 in breast cancers is a successful paradigm. Use of tamoxifen (TAM), an endocrine therapeutic agent targeting ER\u03b1, has reduced recurrence and improved survival in patients with different stages of breast cancer [1]. Thus, TAM has been widely accepted as a fundamental adjuvant therapy for breast cancers, and ER\u03b1 is routinely detected in the clinical setting.",

            "text": "However, the expression of ER\u03b1 does not completely parallel the response to hormonal therapy. Roughly a quarter of ER\u03b1 positive breast cancers are insensitive to TAM and a substantial proportion of sensitive patients would develop resistance [1]. The identification of G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER), also referred to as GPR30 belonging to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, provides a potential mechanism for these phenomena, for the following reasons: First, the agents applied in hormone therapy of breast cancers, including TAM and fulvestrant, have been repeatedly described as GPER agonists [2,3]. GPER and its cross-talk with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) play a key role in acquired resistance in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) after long-term treatment with TAM [4]. Second, GPER may mediate the cytological proliferation effect of estrogenic substances [5]. Third, GPER promotes cellular migration and mobilization in response to estrogen [5,6]. Last, GPER may contribute to the chemoresistance of cytotoxic agents [7]. Furthermore, GPER is associated with poor survival of endometrial carcinoma and ovarian cancers [8,9]. We hypothesize that GPER plays important roles in breast cancer progression or mammary carcinogenesis. To evaluate GPER in primary breast cancers, we assessed its expression by immunohistochemistry, and correlated GPER expression with clinicopathological variables in 423 cases of breast cancers.",

We evaluated GPER in primary breast cancers. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect GPER in paraffin-embedded tissues of primary breast cancers from 423 patients and GPER expression was correlated with clinicopathological factors. Results: GPER was expressed in 63.8% of specimens, coexpressed with estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) in 36.6% of tumors and was positive in 62.5% of the ER\u03b1negative tumors. The expression of GPER had no relationship with the status of ER\u03b1, progesterone receptor and HER2. Although the expression of GPER was significantly inversely related with nodal status (p= 0.045), no correlation between GPER expression and other clinicopathological variables (age, menstruation status, tumor size, stage, histologic grade, Nottingham Prognostic Index or pathological type) was found. Conclusion: GPER and ER\u03b1 exhibited independent expression pattern of distribution in primary breast cancers. A long-term follow-up and a more definite molecular phenotype for ER are necessary in confirming studies.",

All patients underwent surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chonqing Medical University during [2006][2007][2008][2009]. For all patients, detailed clinicopathological data including pathological diagnoses, results of immunohistochemical studies for ER\u03b1, progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2, lymph node status, tumor grade, and tumor size were obtained from hospital records. As routine tests, rabbit monoclonal antibodies of ER\u03b1 (Clone SP1), PR (Clone SP2), and HER2 (Clone SP3) (Maxim.Bio, FuZhou, China) were used in the immunohistochemistry assay. A minimum of 1% positively stained in nucleus of tumor cells in a specimen was considered positive for ER\u03b1 and PR, whereas if less than 1% of tumor cells stained, the sample was considered negative. Nottingham Combined Histological Grading system was employed to evaluate the tumor grade. Nuclear grade, tubule formation and mitotic rate were given a score between 1 and 3 and the scores of were added together for a total score. Scores of 3-5, 6-7, and 8-9 were defined as the low (G1), intermediate (G2) and high (G3) grade, respectively. As a well accepted predictor, the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI= 0.2\u00d7 S+N+G; S is the size of the index lesion, N is the number of involved lymph nodes and G is tumor grade) was calculated for all patients.",

No significant difference was found when NPI was compared between GPER+ and GPER-tumors. Moreover, no correlation was found between GPER expression and the other variables analyzed ( Table 3).",

            "text": "In our series, GPER was positive in 63.8% of specimens, regardless of ER\u03b1 and/or PR status, as well as the histopathological tumor subtype. This proportion is in the range of previous studies, indicating wide distribution for this receptor in breast cancers [10,15]. As aforementioned, there is not complete concordance between the ER\u03b1-targeted therapeutic response and its expression [1]. Furthermore, resistance would occur in approximately half of the patients who have taken TAM  treatment [1], but the mechanism is not clear. GPER, as an alternative estrogen receptor, may provide a potential interpretation. The interaction between ERs and EGFR has focused much attention on acquired TAM-resistance, whereas GPER can transactivate EGFR in response to TAM, hydroxytamoxifen and fulvestrant [3]. Furthermore, enhanced sensitivity to estradiol (E2) and specific agonist of GPER, G1 (1-[4-(6-bromobenzo [1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c] quinolin-8-yl]-ethanone), via GPER, has been observed in MCF-7 cells cultured long-term with TAM, resulting in resistance to the inhibitory effect of TAM [4]. Thus, GPER probably plays an important role in the non-response and acquired-resistance to ER\u03b1 antagonism in patients with breast cancer. In our study, GPER was expressed in 64.9% of patients with ER+ tumors who would presumably take endocrine therapy. For this subpopulation, GPER signalling-blockage should be supplemented with current endocrine therapy. GPER was also respectively detected in 62.5% and 61.9% of ER-, and ER-/PR-cancers, respectively, which would not be included in hormonal therapy. Accordingly, GPER-targeted drugs is possible as an alternative hormonal therapy and would benefit more patients, since a selective GPER antagonist has been identified [16,17]. Filardo et al. [10] was the first to detect GPER in clinical specimens of breast cancer. GPER expression was positively associated with tumor size, HER2 immunohistochemical scores and distant metastasis in their report, suggesting that GPER may be involved in breast cancer progression. In the present series, GPER had no significant influence on the tumor size, consistent with Kuo et al. [13] and our previous report [14] in Chinese but Filardo's [10] observations in Americans. Thus, racial differences may contribute to the discrepancy. Notably, one third (106/321) of the patients in Filardo's series [10] developed metastases, whereas distant metastatic cases were absent in the later reports. This probably underlies the difference. Interestingly, we observed a significant protective effect of GPER on pathological lymph node invasion because GPER+ tumors displayed significant lower mean rank of pathological lymphonode grade (Table 3). None of the early reports showed a significant association between expression of GPER and lymph node invasion [10,13]. There is no more information on this point so far. Thus, a confirmative investigation is needed. For post-operative breast cancers, NPI is the best-documented prognostic index combining tumor size, nodal status and histological grade. ER\u03b1 had a significant (p= 0.048), negative impact on tumor NPI. In contrast, GPER manifested no influence on NPI in our series which was consistent with recent reports showing that GPER has no impact on long-term outcomes of patients with breast cancer [13,15]. The correlation between GPER and HER2 expression is controversial. In contrast to observation by Filardo et al. [10], no significant association between GPER and HER2 expression was found in Kuo's [13], Arias-Pulido's [15], and our investigation ( Table 2). Although GPER functionally transactivate EGFR in response to E2, it is worth noting that HER2 is not EGFR and a functional relationship between HER2 and GPER is not implied. GPER showed no relationship with additional prognostic factors either. Thus, GPER may not be an independent prognostic factor. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up outcomes were absent in the present report, limiting our preliminary conclusion.",

We correlated the status of both ERs to prognostic factors. Interestingly, GPER-/ER-tumors tended to have a maximum NPI, rank of pathological node grade, stage, and histological grade (Table 4), although the differences were not significant excluding HER2 scores across subgroups (p= 0.046). This is a reminder that GPER is merely a collaborator in estrogenic effects [18].The interaction between GPER and ER\u03b1 has been suggested [18], and the function of GPER may vary with ERs expression type in breast cancer cells [19], although the mechanisms are far from clear. Thus, a more definite classification of ERs molecular phenotype is necessary. Confirming studies and longterm follow-up in different subgroups of tumors is significant.",
