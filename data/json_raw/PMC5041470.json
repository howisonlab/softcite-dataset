            "text": "During DNA damage response (DDR), certain gene rich chromosome territories (CTs) relocate to newer positions within interphase nuclei and revert to their native locations following repair. Such dynamic relocation of CTs has been observed under various cellular conditions, however, the underlying mechanistic basis of the same has remained largely elusive. In this study, we aim to understand the temporal and molecular details of such crosstalk between DDR signaling and CT relocation dynamics. We demonstrate that signaling at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by the phosphorylated histone variant (\u03d2-H2AX) is a prerequisite for damage induced CT relocation, as cells deficient in \u03d2-H2AX signaling fail to exhibit such a response. Inhibition of Rad51 or DNA Ligase IV mediated late steps of double strand break repair does not seem to abrogate CT relocation completely. Upon DNA damage, an increase in the levels of chromatin bound motor protein nuclear myosin 1 (NM1) ensues, which appears to be functionally linked to \u03d2-H2AX signaling. Importantly, the motor function of NM1 is essential for its recruitment to chromatin and CT relocation following damage. Taking these observations together, we propose that early DDR sensing and signaling result in NM1 recruitment to chromosomes which in turn guides DNA damage induced CT relocation.",

            "text": "Double strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA can be repaired by two major repair pathways namely -the non homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) (5,6). DSBs are sensed by ATM kinase, which in turn gets activated and phosphorylates a number of downstream protein targets that participate in the DSB repair pathways (7). One such phosphorylation target of ATM kinase is H2AX (8), a histone H2A variant that represents about 2-25% of the H2A complement in the genome (9). H2AX present in the chromatin, flanking a DSB, gets phosphorylated at its Ser139 residue in mammalian cells also by several other members of the phosphatidylinositol 3kinase-like kinases (PI3KK) family, such as ATR, DNAPK (8,10) and the phosphorylated version of H2AX is referred to as \u03d2-H2AX (9). Once formed \u03d2-H2AX via downstream signaling leads to the recruitment of ATM kinase at the DSB sites, ultimately resulting in the formation of more \u03d2-H2AX molecules in the chromatin, thereby generating an important 'hub' of protein-protein interactions required for DNA repair (11,12). Such \u03d2-H2AX foci spanning up to 1 Mb can form on either side of the break (9,13) and signal the recruitment of several repair proteins such as MDC-1, RNF8/UBC13, 53BP1, BRCA1, etc. (14,15) and chromatin modifiers such as IN080 and NuA4 to the DSBs (16)(17)(18). As expected, H2AX deficient cells are hypersensitive to DNA damage and show defective cell cycle checkpoint activity (19)(20)(21). In such cells, DSB repair by HR is inefficient even though the NHEJ repair pathway seems to be unaffected (22).",

Such enhanced mobility in chromatin is known to require active repair proteins such as Mec1 (ATR homolog) and HR proteins like Rad51, Rad54 (25). In contrast, a study in mammalian cells has shown that DNA ends at a single targeted DSB appear to be positionally sta-ble, which might attenuate illegitimate joining of breaks, genomic instability and consequent inaccurate repair (26). Even though single DSBs are ascribed to be positionally stable, chromatin domains containing multiple random breaks seem to undergo spatial movements, which in turn depend on higher order organization of chromatin (27). Moreover, relocation of chromatin domains may also contribute to multiple DSBs clustering together at repair foci as observed in yeast and mammalian cells (28,29). Such dynamic clusters of repair foci are thought to represent repair centres or even factories (28)(29)(30)(31).",

Such non-random arrangement of chromosomes within the nucleus has been studied in several different species such as humans, apes, chicken, bovine, etc. (34,36,37) and it has been found that the organization of the CTs is based on gene density, where the gene dense chromosomes position in the centre of the nucleus and the gene poor chromosomes toward the nuclear periphery (38,39). Several studies have shown that certain CTs relocate to new locations within the nucleus under specific conditions such as serum starvation, disease, differentiation, etc. (40)(41)(42)(43)(44)(45). We have previously reported that certain CTs reposition in the nucleus in response to DNA damage induced by agents such as cisplatin and hydrogen peroxide that lead to production of DNA DSBs during DNA damage response (DDR) (46)(47)(48)(49)(50)(51)(52)(53)(54). Such DNA damage induced CT repositioning is dependent on sensing and repair of the damage (46). Previous studies have demonstrated that open chromatin and gene rich chromosomes are more susceptible to DNA damage (55,56). CT relocation following DNA damage seems to be somehow linked to the gene density status of the chromosomes since only the relatively gene-rich CTs show such damage induced relocation (46). DNA damage induced CT relocation spans over a distance of several microns similar to that of long-range clustering together of repair foci observed in mammalian cells (29,30). We surmise that radiation induced multiple damage containing chromatin domains from different CTs coalesce into repair centres (29,30), and this may be akin or mechanistically linked to the dynamic changes associated with damage induced CT relocations. Importantly, CT relocation is reversible upon repair, i.e. the CTs return to their 'native positions' after the damaging agent is removed and the cells are allowed to recover (46).",

            "text": "Nuclear motors such as actin and myosin have been shown to play an important role in the relocation of CTs following serum starvation (40) and also in the repositioning of a gene locus (57), or a chromosome site upon gene activation (58). Nuclear myosins are encoded by several classes of myosin genes including MYO1C that expresses three different protein isoforms -isoform A, isoform B or nuclear myosin 1 (NM1) and isoform C that get translocated into the nucleus via an NLS present in all the three isoforms (59)(60)(61)(62). NM1 was the first nuclear myosin to be identified (63) and is the predominant nuclear isoform, whereas isoform C is primarily localized in the cytoplasm (60). Isoform C is the shortest isoform and differs from NM1 by the absence of 16 amino acids from the N-terminus of NM1 (59,60). The longest MYO1C gene encoded isoform is A, which was identified recently by Ihnatovych et al. (60). Interestingly nuclear isoforms A and B seem to have diverse functions as the former co-localizes only with Pol II, while the latter interacts with both Pol I and Pol II (60). NM1 and nuclear actin have been shown to function in transcription mediated by RNA polymerase I and II (64)(65)(66)(67)(68)(69)(70)(71). It was discovered as early as 2004 that an actomyosin motor complex is physically coupled to RNA pol I machinery (72), but it is only recently that the direct interactions of NM1 with rDNA chromatin and Pol II promoters were demonstrated using ChIP/qPCR and ChIP Seq techniques (69,70,73). Moreover, these studies have shown that NM1 interacts with rDNA through its C-terminus, which in turn is regulated by GSK3\u2424 mediated phosphorylation of NM1 (69,73). Such chromatin bound NM1 functions together with RNA Pol I-associated actin to regulate rDNA transcription (66,69). NM1 also participates in chromatin remodeling through interactions with WSTF and SNFh2 components of the B-WICH remodeler complex (64,69). Almuzzaini et al. have also provided insights about how NM1 helps in the maintenance and preservation of Pol II activating histone modifications such as H3K9Ac and H3K4me3 by directly recruiting histone acetyl transferase PCAF and histone methyl transferase Set1/Ash2 to the chromatin (70).",

            "text": "Despite the extensive mechanistic knowledge of DDR pathways and nuclear motor protein functions in transcription, it is still unclear if and how DDR signaling, nuclear motor proteins are involved in DNA damage induced CT relocation. Here, using cisplatin as an inducer of DNA damage, we report that the early signaling by \u03d2-H2AX is required for the repositioning of CTs within the nucleus following DNA damage. Later stages of repair catalyzed by proteins such as DNA ligase IV and Rad51 do not seem to play as critical a role as early sensors in programming the CT relocation events. We have also found that recruitment of the nuclear motor protein NM1 to chromatin increases after cisplatin or hydrogen peroxide induced DNA damage; which seems to be functionally coupled with \u03d2-H2AX signaling and dependent upon the sensors of DNA damage such as ATM, ATR, PARP-1 and DNAPK. Knocking down of NM1 levels by RNAi or motor function defects in NM1 also lead to the failure of CT relocation during DDR. All these results put together, for the first time, suggest that early events of DDR and the DNA damage induced NM1 recruitment to chromosomes drive the spatial changes in CTs following DNA damage.",

Denaturation was performed at 70 \u2022 C for 2 min in 70% formamide (2X SSC). Ten microliters of labeled human chromosome DNA probe (Applied Spectral Imaging) that had been denatured at 80 \u2022 C for 7 min and re-annealed at 37 \u2022 C for 20 min, was applied to the denatured cells. Hybridization was done at 37 \u2022 C overnight. Post hybridization, washes were performed at 72 \u2022 C in 0.4X SSC (3 \u00d7 3 min) and 4X SSC with 0.1% Tween20 (3 \u00d7 3 min). Cells were mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI. At least 100 nuclei were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope at 100x magnification and processed through the software package IMACULAT (76,77) for quantitation of the probe signal. One-way ANOVA and t-tests were performed.",

Because of this observed variability, we could not use these markers as reliable loading controls.

            "text": "Cells expressing the mutant H2AX S139A showed fewer number of \u03d2-H2AX foci upon cisplatin damage than those in either untransfected or H2AX wild type transfected control cells ( Figure 1A-C). Since only half of H2AX in the chromatin comprises of mutant form of protein (Supplementary Figure S1: Panel B), therefore we surmise that the same must have acted as dominant-negative in order to show a decrease in the overall \u03d2-H2AX foci count. It was also assessed whether such decrease in \u03d2-H2AX levels in the mutant cells leads to a concomitant drop in its downstream protein signaling targets. After DNA damage, levels of 53BP1 levels have been observed to increase (84)(85)(86), following which \u03d2-H2AX signaling leads to the accumulation of 53BP1 at DSB sites (18,86). It has been suggested that the role of phosphorylated 53BP1 can be uncoupled from DSB repair, as the binding of 53BP1 to DSBs has been found to be independent of its phosphorylation status (87). We therefore monitored total 53BP1 levels in H2AX S139A cells and compared the same with untransfected and H2AX wild type transfected cells following DNA damage. Similar to earlier reports in normal human fibroblasts (85,88), we also observed that untransfected, H2AX wild type or H2AX S139A mutant expressing NHDFs without any damage exhibited faint immunostaining of 53BP1. Moreover, as expected, nearly all the nuclei (\u223c100%) in the case of untransfected NHDFs or H2AX wild type expressing control cells showed high levels (mean intensity > 27 a.u.) of total 53BP1 following cisplatin damage. In contrast, only 21.8% of H2AX S139A expressing cells displayed high levels of 53BP1 (Figure 2A and B) and the remaining large fraction of nuclei in these cells showed only basal levels of 53BP1 even after DNA damage. Recruitment of chromatin remodeler INO80 has been shown to ensue via direct interaction with \u03d2-H2AX foci at the DSB sites (17). Therefore, we assessed the protein levels of the INO80 in the nuclear soluble and chromatin fractions in H2AX S139A cells before and after cisplatin damage. In nuclear fractionation experiments, the total coomassie protein load was used as a loading control (79-81) instead of conventional loading controls such as actin, tubulin because we observed changes in actin (Supplementary Figure S4: Panel E) and tubulin levels in the nuclear fractions upon DNA damage. The recruitment of INO80 to the chromatin pellet fraction did not increase in mutant cells upon DNA damage, which contrasted from that of untransfected or wild type H2AX expressing cells where INO80 levels were increased in the chromatin fraction following damage ( Figure 2C-F). All these results put together confirmed that the decrease in \u03d2-H2AX foci number led to a concomitant reduction of its downstream signaling in the mutant H2AX expressing cells following DNA damage.",

            "text": "In order to understand the role of \u03d2-H2AX in DNA damage induced CT relocations, the positions of chromosomes 19, 15 and 11 were monitored in cells expressing mutant \u03d2-H2AX and compared with their control counterparts. Positions of these chromosomes were not significantly changed in the untransfected and H2AX transfected cells (Supplementary Figure S2: Panel D) in the absence of any DNA damage. Upon DNA damage, in control cells the relocation of chromosome 19 from nuclear interior to nuclear periphery and chromosome 15 from nuclear periphery to the interior was observed and this corroborated our earlier results (46)  (Figure 3A and B). However, such DNA damage induced relocation of both these chromosomes was not observed in the cells expressing mutant H2AX S139A construct ( Figure 3C). Chromosome 11 whose position (peripheral to intermediate within the nucleus) remains unaltered following DNA damage (46) was taken as a negative control and as expected its position remained unchanged in the untransfected cells as well as the H2AX construct expressing cells following DNA damage. Volumes of the CTs were not significantly altered in undamaged versus cisplatin damaged conditions in the control cells (untransfected, H2AX wild type transfected) and H2AX S139A transfected cells (Supplementary Figure S3: Panel A-C).",

Therefore, it can be speculated that by remodeling chromatin at multiple DSB sites, \u03d2-H2AX signaling may lead to a concerted structural change at a whole chromosomal level, finally guiding DNA damage induced CT relocation.",

In order to assess what happens to CT relocation when later stages of DSB repair are inhibited, we analyzed cells in which the function of DNA ligase IV or Rad51 [repair proteins that function during relatively later stages of NHEJ and HR pathways, respectively (90-93)] is inhibited or knocked down. The technique of 2D-FISH was used for the analysis of CT positions in these experiments. 2D-FISH is a relatively more facile technique in comparison to 3D-FISH and when statistically high number of nuclei (at least 100 per experiment) are analyzed, 2D-FISH does indeed corroborate the CT positions uncovered by 3D-FISH (40,46,77).",

            "text": "Inhibition of DNA ligase IV by a specific chemical inhibitor SCR7 (94)(95)(96), resulted in partial relocation of CT 19 and near complete relocation of CT 15 following 4 h of cisplatin damage ( Figure 4A). A similar result was observed in the case of Rad51 siRNA treated cells in comparison to the control siRNA treated cells ( Figure 4B). It is plausible that CT 19 being most gene dense chromosome is more sensitive to inhibition of late repair steps (NHEJ or HR), leading to some effect on its CT dynamics. But clearly CT 15 dynamics were relatively unaffected by inhibition in these late repair steps. Expectedly, position of the negative control CT 11 (peripheral to intermediate) remained unchanged post cisplatin damage under all these conditions. Since cisplatin damage treatment exceeding 6-7 h resulted in significantly higher level of cell death in DNA ligase IV inhibitor treated and Rad51 knockdown conditions, CT positioning analyses at longer time points of damage treatment were not carried out. The partial (CT 19) or nearly complete (CT 15) relocation of CTs in response to DNA damage, when the function of late repair proteins DNA ligase IV or Rad51 are inhibited/knocked down suggests that the early steps of DSB repair play a more important role in CT relocation than the later stages of repair. In fact such partial effects on CT repositioning might be an indirect consequence of repair inhibition impacting the early sensors and effectors. Initiation of damage sensing and signaling that does not accomplish DNA repair (due to inhibition of late players of repair) may feedback inhibit ongoing CT relocation leading to partial inhibitory effects.",

            "text": "DNA damage induced CT relocation is specific to certain gene rich chromosomes and therefore, does not seem to be a random diffusion based process. The motor protein NM1 has been implicated in whole chromosome repositioning during serum starvation (40) and also in the repositioning of a chromosomal domain (58). To assess if the same motor protein is involved in the context of DNA damage induced CT repositioning, the levels of this protein were analyzed before and after DNA damage. NM1 levels in the chromatin fraction were already high in control NHDFs even in the absence of DNA damage ( Figure 5A). Such       high levels of chromatin bound NM1 are consistent with its functional roles in nuclear processes such as transcription and chromatin remodeling, etc. (64)(65)(66)68,97). Interestingly upon cisplatin damage, the levels of NM1 in chromatin fraction showed a measurable increase (\u223c1.5-to 2-fold) as compared to undamaged control ( Figure 5A (ii)). However, surprisingly the levels of NM1 in the whole cell lysates (Supplementary Figure S4: Panel B) or whole nuclei (Supplementary Figure S4: Panel C) did not seem to change after cisplatin damage. The relative levels of NM1 in undamaged cells (the nuclear soluble (NS) versus chromatin pellet (CP) fraction with respect to the total nuclear NM1 after normalization for differential protein load) showed \u223c55% of NM1 in the CP fraction, while the remaining was in NS form. Following cisplatin damage, the chromatin bound NM1 increased to \u223c76% of the total nuclear NM1 ( Figure 5A (iii)). These results were also corroborated by immunostaining experiments, where high number of NM1 puncta within the nucleus were observed even in undamaged state, with an increase in the number of puncta following DNA damage (Supplementary Figure S6: Panel A and B). Marginal increase in NM1 puncta following DNA damage is consistent with \u223c1.5to 2-fold increase in chromatin bound NM1 observed in the Western analysis. Such an increase in chromatin bound NM1 occurred after at least two types of DNA damages, as cells treated with hydrogen peroxide also showed similar (\u223c1.5-fold) increase in the chromatin bound protein (Supplementary Figure S4: Panel D).",

NM1 started dissociating from the chromatin pellet into the soluble fraction at 400 mM NaCl, but most of the protein was still associated with the pellet fraction of chromatin even at 800 mM NaCl concentration. Histone H4, a tightly bound protein in the chromatin, was taken as an internal control and as expected it did not elute into the soluble fraction even at 800 mM NaCl. These data indicated that NM1 is a stably bound component of chromatin fraction, but starts eluting at a NaCl concentration lower than that required for a core histone such as H4. Cisplatin damaged nuclei exhibited an essentially similar elution profile of NM1 and H4 proteins as the undamaged control nuclei. Interestingly, the nature of association of NM1 with chromatin does not seem to get affected following DNA damage.",

            "text": "In the previous experiment, we showed that induction of DNA damage leads to enhanced recruitment of NM1 to chromatin. In order to test if \u03d2-H2AX signaling has any role in the recruitment of NM1 to the chromatin as well as the repositioning of CTs following DNA damage, we analyzed the levels of NM1 in the chromatin fraction in \u03d2-H2AX wild type and compared it with that in H2AX S139A mutant expressing cells. The wild type H2AX construct expressing cells showed the expected increase in NM1 recruitment to the chromatin fraction just like the untransfected NHDFs. Surprisingly, such an increase in chromatin bound NM1 was not observed in H2AX S139A expressing cells and the recruitment of NM1 to the chromatin fraction remained unchanged in these cells before and after cisplatin damage ( Figure 5C). Therefore, these results suggest that \u03d2-H2AX signaling is functionally coupled with the cisplatin damage induced enhanced chromatin recruitment of NM1. In our previous study (46), we had shown that the recognition of DNA damage by sensor and repair proteins, such as ATM kinase and DNAPK precedes CT relocation. Therefore, we tested if such DNA damage induced recruitment of NM1 to the chromatin fraction also requires the function of DSB sensors such as ATM, ATR kinase, PARP-1 and DNAPK. As reported earlier (98-100), \u03d2-H2AX immunostaining was found to decrease in cells pretreated with ATM, ATR or DNAPK inhibitor following cisplatin damage (Supplementary Figure S5: Panel A-C). Interestingly, we observed that cells upon prior treatment with inhibitors for not only sensor proteins ATM, ATR and DNAPK, but also PARP-1 failed to exhibit enhanced chromatin recruitment of NM1 following cisplatin damage ( Figure 6A-D), thereby suggesting that general sensing of DNA damage seems to be mechanistically coupled to the process of NM1 recruitment to the chromatin following DNA damage.",

In order to check if this nuclear motor is essential for CT relocation during DDR, we employed siRNA mediated knockdown of the MYO1C gene (Supple-mentary Figure S7: Panel A-C). The siRNA knockdown resulted in \u223c60-70% reduction in NM1 levels as assessed by Western analysis. By using chromosome-specific 2D-FISH analysis (46,76,77), we assessed the positions of chromosome 19, 15 and 11 in cells transfected with control and MYO1C siRNA. Such analyses corroborated our results that control NHDFs (treated with the control siRNA) exhibited the expected relocation of chromosome 19 from the nuclear interior to the periphery upon cisplatin damage and vice versa for chromosome 15. However, in the same experimental conditions, MYO1C knockdown cells failed to show any damage induced relocation of chromosome 19 and 15 ( Figure 7). Expectedly, chromosome 11 taken as a negative control did not show any spatial relocation following DNA damage in cells treated with either siRNA. Since, the MYO1C siRNA that has been used for RNAi experiment (Figure 7) is a mixture of oligonucleotide probes directed against entire MYO1C gene and thus siRNA effects may not be specific to any particular isoform of myosin 1C, as any of or all three isoforms (a, b or c -all of which are found in the nucleus) might have been down regulated in the siRNA experiment. Since NM1 levels certainly decrease following the siRNA treatment as observed by Western blotting and IF analyses (Supplementary Figure S7: Panel A-C), it is clear that NM1 is definitely required for the process of CT relocation during DDR. The specific participation of the myosin 1C isoforms, if any, in CT relocation remains to be investigated and it would be interesting to uncover if these three nuclear isoforms cross-talk/coordinate with each other in the context of DNA damage and repair.",

            "text": "NM1 mutants that have impaired motor function are unable to associate with RNA polymerase I and rDNA (66,69). To understand how the motor activity of NM1 influences its enhanced chromatin binding and CT relocation post DNA damage, cells over-expressing V5 tagged NM1 motor function defective mutant (G126S-that has defective ATPase function) or wild type NM1 were analyzed (66). As expected, in the control cells expressing wild type NM1, damage induced increase in chromatin recruitment of NM1 and CT relocation were observed (Figure 8). In contrast, the NM1-G126S mutant expressing cells failed to show such DNA damage induced changes (Figure 8), indicating that the motor function of NM1 was important for its binding to chromatin following damage and for the subsequent CT relocation. This is a significant mechanistic insight highlighting the importance of nuclear myosin's motor function not only for its association with Pol I transcriptional machinery (66) but also for its binding to chromatin following DNA damage and mediating CT repositioning. It is important to note here that the resident level of NM1-G126S in chromatin fraction prior to DNA damage does not seem to change compared to wild type NM1 ( Figure 8A). Moreover, a previous study has shown that an impaired motor activity mutant of NM1 protein (RK605AA) fails to recruit to rDNA chromatin; we believe that our bulk chromatin fractionation assay does not seem to capture such finer details of NM1 recruitment (69). However, the results of experiments involving dominant negative G126S mutant of NM1 (Figure 8) do seem to reinforce the result of siRNA experiment (Figure 7) that isoform NM1 certainly does participate in the CT relocation occurring post cisplatin damage. The phosphorylation of NM1 by GSK3\u2424 kinase has been reported to regulate NM1 binding to rDNA (73). In order to test if such phosphorylation of NM1 is also required for the increased chromatin binding of NM1 and subsequent CT relocation following DNA damage, we inhibited GSK3\u2424 kinase using LiCl, a commonly used specific inhibitor of this kinase (101)(102)(103)(104)(105)(106)(107). We confirmed the inhibition of GSK3\u2424, by monitoring its inactive form Phospho-Ser-9 GSK3\u2424 (103,104,107). In cells treated with LiCl, the inactive phospho-form of GSK3\u2424 increased in comparison with the untreated cells ( Supplementary Figure S9), implying that addition of LiCl inhibited GSK3\u2424 in our experimental conditions. Following this, we compared NM1 levels in chromatin fraction as well as CT positions, before and after cisplatin damage. It was observed that the damage induced increase in NM1 recruitment to chromatin and CT relocation occurred in both untreated control as well as LiCl treated cells (Figure 9), suggesting that the phosphorylation of NM1 by GSK3\u2424 does not seem to impact DNA damage induced NM1 functions. We also probed for changes in phospho-NM1 using a phospho-serine-threonine specific antibody on immunoprecipitated NM1 from nuclear solu-ble and chromatin fractions. The bulk phosphorylation status of NM1 (nuclear soluble or chromatin-bound) was not affected by cisplatin damage treatment (data not shown). Although the bulk phosphorylation of nuclear myosin does not seem to change following DNA damage, this aspect needs further detailed analyses of whether phosphorylation at specific sites of NM1, if any, change in contrast to bulk phosphorylation post DNA damage. It is likely that the analysis of NM1 phosphorylation spectrum may uncover interesting differences specific to transcriptional versus DNA damage induced functional states of NM1 in chromatin.",

Interestingly, the NM1 puncta normalized to chromosome size revealed a higher count for CT 19 (\u223c0.3) in comparison with that of CTs 15 and 11 (\u223c0.1). Since the number of NM1 puncta per CT was not significantly different following DNA damage, it was not possible to address if the increased pan-chromatin NM1 recruitment (\u223c1.5-to 2-fold) that we observed earlier following DNA damage could be mapped to specific chromosomes by immuno-FISH analyses. We believe that capturing of contours of CTs by immuno-FISH is not accurate enough to map the myosin puncta to specific territories. Therefore, we cannot address nuclear myosin puncta increase vis-\u00e0-vis specific CTs with the current resolution of images. Much improved resolution and analyses of CTconformations/contours is required to address this issue.",

The functions of NM1 in the context of DDR are largely unknown. Our study for the first time delves into the involvement of NM1 in DDR in mammalian cells. In particular, we demonstrate that human fibroblasts are enriched with nuclear myosin that is tightly bound to chromatin (Figure 5A and B) and this association of NM1 to the chromatin is enhanced upon the induction of DNA damage using cisplatin or hydrogen peroxide-agents that lead to production of DNA DSBs during the DDR ( Figure 5A), implying its functional relevance in DDR. This is further corroborated by two more lines of evidence: firstly, inhibition of upstream damage sensors such as ATM, ATR, DNAPK and PARP-1 led to the loss of DDR-associated recruitment of NM1 ( Figure 6) and secondly, down regulation of \u03d2-H2AX signaling itself also led to a concomitant loss in NM1 recruitment to chromatin ( Figure 5C). We surmise that large-scale chromatin remodeling associated with multiple \u03d2-H2AX sites might trigger loading of DDR-induced NM1 on to chromatin. Indeed, siRNA mediated knockdown of NM1 levels or motor function defects in NM1 abrogated DNA damage induced CT relocation (Figures 7 and 8). NM1 has been implicated in relocation of CTs (40) as well as repositioning of a chromosomal domain (58).",

We speculate that a co-ordination between early DDR sensing and signaling by ATM kinase, DNAPK and \u03d2-H2AX; subsequent chromatin remodeling and NM1 recruitment to the chromatin, is required for DNA damage induced CT relocation, which is an integral part of DDR. CT relocation perhaps is a means by which the cell orchestrates large-scale remodeling of nuclear milieu, thereby rewiring the transcriptional program to efficiently perform DDR in order to maintain its genomic stability.",
