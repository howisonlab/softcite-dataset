            "text": "Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder that is frequently treated by propranolol or primidone. However, 30% of patients with ET do not respond to either propranolol or primidone. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate for ET. We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant randomized controlled trials on the effects of topiramate for ET. A meta-analysis technique was applied to estimate the efficacy and safety of topiramate. The primary outcome was the change in the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale (TRS). The secondary outcomes included the respective change in the location, motor tasks/function and function disability scores, and adverse events. We included 3 randomized controlled trials with a total of 294 participants. Topiramate was significantly better than placebo in reducing TRS of patients with ET (mean difference [MD] \u00c08.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] \u00c015.46 to \u00c01.70). Changes from the scales of upper limb tremor severity (MD \u00c05.12, 95% CI \u00c07.79 to \u00c02.45), motor tasks/function (MD \u00c05.07, 95% CI \u00c07.12 to \u00c03.03), and functional disability (MD \u00c04.72, 95% CI \u00c06.77 to \u00c02.67) were significantly greater with topiramate than with placebo. More participants taking topiramate experienced adverse events leading to withdrawal than those taking placebo (risk difference 19%, 95% CI 11%-27%). There is consistent evidence supporting the efficacy of topiramate in treating ET; however, a significant proportion of participants withdrew due to its adverse effects."

[6][7][8] Propranolol may cause fatigue, muscle weakness, impotence, and sleep disorders. Propranolol is contraindicated in patients with asthma and heart block and has clinical interactions with other drugs frequently used by the elderly, such as digoxin, calcium channel blockers, and antiarrhythmics. 9 Primidone causes dizziness. Its active metabolite, phenobarbital, interferes with the metabolism of many drugs including warfarin. 9 Hence, there is a need for alternative treatment options for ET.",

Based on the limited data from clinical trials, topiramate may lead to significant tremor reduction and improved functional disability compared with placebo, [13][14][15][16] and has been proposed as a potential treatment of ET. 17 On the other hand, adverse effects, including concentration deficit, paresthesia, and nausea, were common in the patients treated with topiramate. 18 A systemic review is thus needed to clarify the evident level of topiramate in treating ET. Herein, we conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate in treating ET.",

            "text": "On the other hand, our study revealed an increased risk of development of AEs, such as sensory changes (paresthesia or taste perversion), cognitive dysfunction (impaired attention, concentration, or memory), or decreased appetite, in the ET participants taking topiramate. Paresthesia or taste perversion induced by topiramate may be related to its carbonic anhydrase inhibition. 18 Increased metabolic activities following high-frequency neuronal firings result in an increase in the intracellular concentration of bicarbonate. 24 Given the excitatory effect of bicarbonate, it is possible that the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase ameliorates the neuronal excitation. In addition, the ability of topiramate to inhibit carbonic anhydrase is also supposed to be related to the activation of hyperpolarizing K \u00fe conductance and then enhance the electrical stabilization of neurons. 25 As a leading cause of drug withdrawal, 26 topiramate-induced cognitive dysfunction is an important adverse effect that affects the tolerability of drug compliance. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated a significant GABAergic potentiation with topiramate, 27,28 which may disturb cognitive function by inhibitory enhancement. 29 -31 The suppression of appetite by topiramate drives its use in eating disorders. 32 It has been shown that stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus by AMPA/kainite agonist causes an intense rapid dose-dependent increase in food intake. 33 Thus suppression of AMPA/kainite receptor by topiramate might contribute to decreased appetite. However, this appetite suppression in the patients with ET seemed not to result in the weight reduction, which is reported in the trials of topiramate for other diseases. 34,35   In addition to ET, topiramate is applied to the treatment of migraine, 12 epilepsy, 11 and diabetic neuropathy. 36 A few well-known complications of topiramate, such as visual events, 37 renal calculi, 38 and word finding difficulties, 39,40 were identified in the trial focusing on these disorders. Ciliochoroidal effusion syndrome, uveitis, and visual field defects were reported in the patients with migraine or epilepsy receiving topiramate treatment. 37 The exact mechanism by which topiramate triggers these visual events is not completely understood. Most studies on topiramate and renal calculi are reported from epileptic patients. 41,42 The majority of renal stones reported with topiramate are calcium phosphate or calcium oxalate, 43,44 which is believed to be due to renal tubular acidosis by inhibition of carbonic anhydrase type II and IV in the proximal and distal renal tubules. 45,46 Word-finding difficulties have been described in epileptic and migrainous patients treated with topiramate. 39,40 The asymmetry of neurotransmitter systems may explain the greater susceptibility of language areas to antiepileptic drugs containing sulfhydryl residues such as topiramate and zonisamide. 47 As a CYP3A4 inducer, topiramate may accelerate the hepatic elimination of oral contraceptives. 48 Female patients taking topiramate may at risks of contraceptive failure and unintended pregnancy. These adverse effects need to be attended in topiramate-treated patients with ET as well.",

It is possible that only studies showing a benefit in treating ET with topiramate have been published. However, we could not assess the publication bias by funnel plot because only 3 trials were included. 19 The different treatment dosages (maximum dose: 400 mg in 2 trials, 14,16 200 mg in the other trial) 13 and experimental duration (24 weeks, 14 10 weeks, 16 and 15 days) 16 may have affected the estimates of treatment effects. Since this is a meta-analysis of study-level data (instead of an individual patient data metaanalysis), we were unable to adjust for confounding variables. Nevertheless, the baseline characteristics of those taking topiramate and placebo across the 3 included trials were comparable. Topiramate has not been compared to propranolol or to primidone in treating ET. Therefore, the comparative effectiveness of topiramate is unknown.",
