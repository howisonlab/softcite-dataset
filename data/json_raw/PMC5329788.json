The biological characteristics of CIK cells were further determined by the characterization of surface markers by flow cytometry. CIK cells inhibited the proliferation of human lung adenocarcinoma NCL-H157 cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was down-regulated in CIK cells co-cultured with NCL-H157 cells by western blotting analysis. Furthermore, in comparison with cells untreated by CIK, the NCL-H157 had a lower proliferation capacity. We proposed that the pharmacological mechanisms of NCL-H157 promoted by CIK can be estimated possibly with different biological significance that can be ascribed to down-regulated VEGF expression in vitro. The results suggest that the VEGF pathway guides developmental inhibiting of NCL-H157, and we speculate that the function of VEGF pathways is to guide NCL-H157 to inhibition by abundant CIK.",

            "text": "Human lung cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases and a leading cause of death annually in much of the developed world especially in China [1]. Adenocarcinoma, the most common form of lung cancer, is one of main human malignant tumors, and its occurrence and development are highly correlated with inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Many genes play a role in negatively regulating lung tumor growth and apoptosis [2][3]. Beyond that, there is little that can be definitively said. The standard test to confirm multipotency is differentiation of the cells into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes, as well as myocytes and neurons. A type of immunological cell, cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are a heterogeneous cell population that was first discovered in the 1990s and can be generated from lymphocytes co-cultured with an anti-CD3 antibody and many other cytokines in vitro [4][5]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that CIK cells exhibit active and potent antitumor cytotoxicity against multifarious tumor cells in vitro and in vivo [6]. CIK cells alter the cytokine secretion profiles of dendritic cells, T cells, and natural killer cells to induce a more anti-inflammatory or tolerant phenotype. This phenomenon has been documented in specific cells and tissues in living animals and their counterparts growing in cell culture [7].",

In the event our study is viewed as merely phenomenological, we stress that our experiments were carefully designed to facilitate the inhibition of NCL-H157 cells and to record these effects, as well. Instead of focusing on NCL-H157 activity, we were more interested in following the inhibition of NCL-H157 that involves cell signal pathways and the breakout function of biological material-CIK cell. We found that the CD3+CD56+ subset of CIK cells was variably naturally active. The CD3+CD56+ subset could be polarized toward either Th1 or Th2 phenotype that, in turn, shapes its anti-tumor activity [8][9].",

NCL-H157 cells were detected after incubation with CIK at designed concentrations and times. CIK plays a critical role in providing the essential micro-environment for NCL-H157 at different CIK concentrations of effector-to-target cell ratios (E/T ratio) ranging from 10:1, 20:1 and 30:1 for 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours, respectively. These images are shown in Figure  1. These results were further confirmed by MTS analysis as shown in Figure 2. The percentage of NCL-H157 in the control group was less than the treated group. When the incubation time was prolonged to 72 hours, a marked Figure 3: Effects of CIK on NCL-H157 viability (n = 5). Cell viability of NCL-H157 treated with different CIK concentrations of effector-totarget cell ratios (E/T ratio) ranged from 10:1, 20:1 and 30:1, for 24h, 48h, and 72h. (*, significant difference between the two groups, p < 0.05) Figure 4: A shows VEGF over-expression in NCL-H157 treated by CIK with western blotting analysis. In order to elucidate the pathway leading to proliferation, we examined the activation of VEGF, which was reported to initiate NCL-H157 generation by various stimuli. NCL-H157 treated with CIK were analyzed for the enzymatic activity by western blot. The expression of VEGF was not activated after CIK treatment in NCL-H157 was down-regulated. The activity of VEGF had significantly changed. B shows densitometric analysis of the levels of VEGF by an image analysis system. (n=6.

            "text": "decrease in the percentage of NCL-H157 cells was observed in CIK-treated groups. The results obtained from MTS analysis suggest that CIK can induce lack of proliferation of NCL-H157, which is consistent with the observation with the inverted phase contrast microscope. In the present study, however, the percentage of inhibition viability cells is not much more than that of the control group. CIK cells establish an appropriate scaffold and a complex network of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix proteins. We showed that a VEGF pathway controls the proliferation of NCL-H157 treated by CIK [10][11]. NCL-H157 express some genes, suggesting the genicity and the superiority for clinical use. CIK cells appear to have cytotoxic effects, indicating their superior role in the management of clinic treatment, and CIK cells were examined for safety and efficacy for carcinoma treatment [12][13][14][15]. We observed markedly enhanced anti-tumor cytotoxic activity of CIK cells after co-culture with NCL-H157. Furthermore, CIK regulates NCL-H157 activity in a time-and concentration-dependent manner. Effective adoptive cell transfer faces numerous challenges, such as systemic immune tolerance and tumor local immune escape. The homing of immune cells to the tumor site is reduced, and the antitumor immune functions are inhibited by tumor microenvironment and immunomodulatory properties of suppressive cell populations [16][17][18]. Collectively, these results demonstrate that VEGF signals coordinate and regulate the dynamics of CIK during VEGFinduced migration of NCL-H157 in varying states of differentiation. Genetic experiments indicate that the VEGF pathway functions independently of pathways governing NCL-H157 inhibition. Future studies using other gene expression should address the extent of the relative stiffness of NCL-H157 mobility as seen in our experiments and elucidate the understanding of the mechanism of NCL-H157 inhibition.",
