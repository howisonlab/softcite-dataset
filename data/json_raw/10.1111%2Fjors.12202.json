            "text": "We test whether commonly used measures of agglomeration economies encourage new firm entry in both urban and rural markets. Using new firm location decisions in Iowa and North Carolina, we find that measured agglomeration economies increase the probability of new firm entry in both urban and rural areas. Firms are more likely to locate in markets with an existing cluster of firms in the same industry, with greater concentrations of upstream suppliers or downstream customers, and with a larger proportion of college-educated workers in the local labor supply. Firms are less likely to enter markets with no incumbent firms in the sector or where production is concentrated in relatively few sectors. The same factors encourage both stand-alone start-ups and establishments built by multiplant firms. Commuting decisions exhibit the same pattern as new firm entry with workers commuting from low to high agglomeration markets. Because agglomeration economies are important for rural firm entry also, policies encouraging new firm entry should focus on relatively few job centers rather than encouraging new firm entry in every small town.",

Firms can receive benefits from sharing facilities and infrastructures, input suppliers and a labor pool. Firms and workers, and buyers and sellers can have better matching in a larger market. New technologies and business practices can be developed and diffused faster in a larger market. The intensity and composition of production activity influences the mechanisms. concentrations of educated workers may hasten adaptation of new ideas and lower the costs of labor turnover (Shapiro, 2006;Moretti, 2004). Having a cluster of similar firms may hasten innovation and improve firm productivity because firms can learn from one another or because they can share a larger specialized labor pool (Porter, 2003). Having a highly diversified mixture of firms may improve cross-fertilization of ideas across different firms (Glaeser et al., 1992;Feldman and Audretch, 1999). Local monopoly allows firms to grow much larger which may enable them to exploit the rents from new innovation without risk that the returns will be lost to competitors (Marshall, 1920).",

By definition, rural areas lack agglomeration and so they would seem to lack these productive advantages that benefit firms in cities. Yet rural areas are diverse, and there is a continuum of sizes along which agglomeration economies may operate. We investigate whether the positive effect of concentrations of economic activity exist in places that are smaller than what we commonly identify as urban. Furthermore, we investigate whether local factors related to agglomeration economies might have different signs or magnitudes of impacts between urban and rural areas. 3 For example, proximity to input suppliers might be more important in rural areas than in urban areas because of the costs of transporting raw materials relative to finished goods (Kilkenny, 1998). Rural firms may be less concerned with the availability of educated workers if they are more concentrated in less-skilled and less technology-oriented industries such as retail or personal services compared to urban firms (Renski and Wallace, 2012).",

If agglomeration generates productivity or cost advantages to firms in a local market, they should have the greatest influence on firms at the time of entry. Because a new venture can open anywhere in principle, firms will assess the value of local agglomeration and other market factors as they decide where to locate. It is costly to relocate once the entry occurs, and so aggregate growth measures that are heavily weighted toward incumbent firms such as local employment or local output growth will reflect past levels of market factors that may no longer apply.",

            "text": "Another advantage to our use of new firm entry as a measure of market response to agglomeration is that local market factors are pre-determined and outside the control of nascent firms. This reduces the problem of reverse causality between agglomeration measures and more commonly used measures of economic performance such as growth in the numbers of firms or workers. For example, there may be a positive correlation between the number of firms and the proportion of college-educated workers due to the mobility of educated workers rather than spillover productivity effects from a concentration of educated workers. However, the entry of one new firm will not alter the concentration of educated workers in the labor market, but a new firm will enter a market with more college-educated workers if the firm can benefit from the spillover productivity benefits. If educated workers do not have spillover effects, new firms would not react to the current distribution of educated workers. 4 We investigate the effect of six measures of agglomeration on firm incentives to locate in an urban or rural market: the number of incumbent firms in the industry; the absence of any incumbent firms in the industry; the degree of industrial diversity; proximity to upstream firms; proximity to downstream firms; and the proportion of college-educated in the adult population. Our results indicate that the same agglomeration measures that have been associated with urban economic growth are important for rural firm entry as well. The pattern holds for both all firms and manufacturing firms, and for both standalone ventures and multiplant firms looking to expand into new markets. The pattern holds for rural firm entry regardless of whether the area is adjacent to or distant from an urban area. Commuters are attracted to the same agglomeration factors that attract new firm start-ups. As a result, even in rural areas, production would be predicted to concentrate increasingly in relatively few locations with workers commuting from the surrounding communities that lack the ability to offer sufficient agglomeration economies.",

We focus on six local attributes that have figured prominently in the literature: clusters of similar firms, the ability to exert monopoly power, industrial diversity, proximity to upstream and downstream firms, and concentrations of educated workers. Marshall (1920) argued that there is an advantage for firms in the same industry to locate near one another because workers and firms learn from each other and the learning helps them develop new ideas. 5 Specialization in a given type of production allows firms to share in a pool of workers with similar skills and saves transportation cost of materials. In addition, new firms will enter as upstream suppliers of inputs for the cluster of firms in the industry.",

The mysteries of the trade become no mysteries; but are as it were in the air, and children learn many of them unconsciously. Good work is rightly appreciated, inventions and improvements in machinery, in processes and the general organization of the business have their merits promptly discussed: if one man starts a new idea, it is taken up by others and combined with suggestions of their own; and thus it becomes the source of further new ideas. And presently subsidiary trades grow up in the neighbourhood, supplying it with implements and materials, organizing its traffic, and in many ways conducing to the economy of its material.\" (Marshall, 1920, p. 271) 6 As an example of how larger firms have greater innovation capacity, Marshall states that \"[in the pottery trade, a small manufacturer] cannot afford even to make experiments with new patterns and designs except in a very tentative way.\" (Marshall, 1920, p. 281) their innovations, although that would presumably limit the spillovers to other firms. 7 Schumpeter (1942) extended this line of reasoning and argued that firms have no incentive to enter perfectly competitive markets because they will not be able to exploit the full advantages of their innovations. 8 Porter (1990) followed Marshall in arguing that clusters of similar specialized firms increases the productivity of all the firms through knowledge spillovers. However, he expanded on Marshall to include other firms in the industry as well as upstream suppliers and downstream customers in the cluster. Interaction and information flows across firms within a cluster promote technological innovation. 9  Helsley and Strange (2002) also support importance of various input suppliers. In contrast to Marshall (1920) and Schumpeter (1942), Porter argued that competition helps technological innovation because competitive pressure makes firms adopt and develop new technology to survive. Jacobs (1969) believed that technology innovation came from industrial diversity rather than industrial specialization. She suggested that seemingly unrelated ideas can provide breakthroughs to achieve technological innovation. 10 Following Jacobs, Lucas (1988) also emphasized the role of interactions between people as the rationale for cities. However, Lucas emphasized that it was concentrations of skilled people that were particularly important for the generation of a human capital externality. Productive interactions between educated people make each of them more productive than they would be in isolation. These externalities counteract the natural tendency of cities to fly apart because concentrations of economic activity bid up the costs of land, labor, and other factors of production.",

(1992), Cingano and Schivardi (2004) found that firm-level productivity was improved by specialization, but not by diversity and local competition. 11 Other studies have found that industrial clusters (specialization) foster more entrepreneurship and lead to higher employment growth (Porter, 2003;Delgado et al., 2010) and higher wages (Wheaton and Lewis, 2002). However, De Blasio and Addario (2005) did not find higher wages in clusters and Duranton (2011) found only modest sized cluster effects. Henderson, Kuncoro, and Turner (1995) found that specialization is important for mature manufacturing industries while industrial diversity is important for high-tech manufacturing industries.",

Because the benefits of agglomeration attenuate with distance (Rosenthal andStrange, 2003, 2008), remote rural communities would need to experience agglomeration due to sufficient intensity in a sector to affect local economic performance. Research has shown that rural industry clusters increase employment (Henry and Drabenstott, 1996) and local wages (Gibbs and Bernat, 1997). Barkley, Henry, and Kim (1999) showed that larger firm clusters in an industry lead to faster employment growth for growing industries in non-metropolitan areas. Gabe (2005) found that greater specialization in a rural firm's own industry increased its capital investment, but the effect is relatively modest. 12 On the other hand, agglomeration economies can spill over to surrounding areas so that rural areas can access urban agglomeration benefits through commuting (Partridge, Ali, and Olfert, 2010). For this reason, positive impacts of urban agglomeration are found in rural areas within a commuting distance of cities (Barkley et al., 1996;Partridge et al., 2007. In principle, urban agglomeration can have positive or negative impacts on rural areas depending on commuting and migration flows, and the relocation of firms (Renkow and Hoover, 2000;Wu and Gopinath, 2008). For example, if urban residents move to adjacent rural towns and commute to urban areas, rural towns may experience spread: positive economic impacts from urban agglomeration. If instead of commuting, rural residents move to the urban center, agglomeration would result in backwash, causing rural communities to decline.",

The opportunity for local monopoly lowers the probability of firm entry, as does greater industrial concentration. Firms are also more likely to locate in counties with higher per capita incomes, with higher amenity index values, higher government expenditures and lower taxes per capita. 22 Table 3 shows how the agglomeration effects vary by market. The first three columns show the estimates for all industries. Column (1) provides estimates based on Equation 5, replicating results for column (4) in Table 2. Column (2) allows the agglomeration effects to vary between rural and urban markets using interaction terms between urban counties (URB c ) and agglomeration measures. Column (3) further distinguishes the agglomeration effects between remote rural counties and rural counties adjacent to urban counties (R_ADJ c ). The direction of the effects of the agglomeration measures is consistent across rural and urban counties, although the magnitudes differ (columns (2) and (3)).

Agglomeration measures matter in both markets and they matter similarly. This result is consistent with Gabe (2003) who finds that industry location quotients have positive effects on business openings in metropolitan, and both adjacent and nonadjacent nonmetropolitan counties in Maine. In fact, the only large difference is that rural firm entry is much more sensitive to the presence of upstream suppliers, and this is true for both adjacent and remote rural counties.",

Proximity to downstream customers also has a significant but smaller positive influence on new firm entry and again the effect is larger in rural markets. Our finding that firms are attracted by close proximity to upstream suppliers and downstream customers was first suggested by Marshall (1920) and is consistent with more recent conclusions regarding urban economic growth advanced by Helsley and Strange (2002), Glaeser and Kerr (2009), and Ellison et al. (2010) for urban markets. Skilled labor (EDU c ) has the second largest positive impact on firm entry overall, and is the most important factor for manufacturing firms, a result consistent with the models of Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988), and with empirical findings reported by Moretti (2004). Consistent with Porter (1990), clusters of local firms in the same industry attract start-ups, while the chance for local monopoly power does not attract firms. Consistent with Jacobs (1969), firms are attracted by a more diverse mix of firms. However, the presence of a monopoly deters entry, suggesting that the benefits from captured rents from     Table 5. The results reported in brackets for monopoly opportunity MON kc are proportional changes in the probability of firm entry going from the absence of a monopoly to the presence of a monopoly in the county-sector market.",

The elasticity for per capita government expenditures is more than twice the size of the elasticity with respect to per capita tax burden. While the amenity index was statistically significant in Table 3, its elasticity is extremely small in Table 4a. 25 These conclusions carry over to manufacturing firms as well: agglomeration economies have similar effects on new firm entry in urban markets, their adjacent rural neighbors, and their more remote rural counties. One other somewhat large difference is that the presence of a monopoly opportunity in the sector reduces the probability of manufacturing firm entry more in urban than in rural markets. Presumably, the lack of any incumbents in a sector has more information in larger markets because the presence of monopoly opportunities is less common than in smaller markets. It appears that monopoly opportunities are not attractive because they signal a lack of comparative advantage for the sector in that location. 26 One implication of our findings is that local agglomeration continually adds to the number of firms entering a market. Even though the elasticities are similar between urban and rural markets, the levels of agglomeration are quite different as seen in Table  1. While agglomeration matters everywhere, it does not exist everywhere. An urban area whose agglomeration measures are 10 percent over or below the urban mean in a way to increase new firm entry probabilities in all the agglomeration measures except local monopoly (MON kc ) will have 20 percent higher new firm entry; while, the corresponding value in a rural area is 3 percent higher new firm entry. On the other hand, rural areas that have atypically higher levels of agglomeration do attract new firms; a rural county at one standard deviation above or below the rural mean in a way to increase new firm entry probabilities in all the agglomeration measures except local monopoly will experience 26 percent more new firm entry. As a result, places with more concentrated activities will continually attract the greatest share of new firms while places that lack these agglomeration advantages will attract few new entrants. 27 This growth pattern results in a persistent hierarchy of city size as described in Central Place Theory (CPT) (Christaller, 1933).",

This result is definitional; any entry into a county that previously had no incumbent firms will increase employment in that sector. The negative effect of monopoly is suppressed because you cannot lower employment from zero. aggregation of past employment decisions made by firms that entered the market under past market conditions and agglomeration levels. Costs of relocation are prohibitive, and so firms may not be in their best location given current market conditions. Consequently, the link between agglomeration measures and the growth of incumbent firms must be weaker than the link between agglomeration factors and the location decisions of entering firms. More importantly, our conditional logit specification estimating equation 5controls for the unobserved firm profit component, \u03b5 i , while the estimation using the county aggregate net sectoral employment data does not. These unobserved firm fixed effects are likely to affect the pace of future firm investment, employment, and production decisions, so they will create unobserved location-specific profitability and productivity factors that are almost certainly correlated with the observed agglomeration measures. Hence, the coefficients and the elasticities in Table 6 are biased and will not yield reliable inferences regarding the role of agglomeration on county-sector growth.",

In theory, agglomeration will raise location-specific productivity, some of which will be captured by workers in the form of higher wages. That will create an incentive for workers in low agglomeration locations to move to or commute to locations with greater agglomeration levels.

Because we show that agglomeration increases new firm entry, we can conjecture that commuting is sensitive to agglomeration economies as well. However, testing this hypothesis has been limited due to the difficulty in measuring magnitudes of local agglomeration economies. Recent commuting studies measured the spillover of urban agglomeration economies to rural towns using the distance between urban centers and rural towns (Partridge et al., 2010;Ali, Olfert, and Partridge, 2011), but this measure does not capture variations in agglomeration economies within rural or urban areas.",

Note that the ratio will be greater than one when a county within 100 miles has a larger level of agglomeration than the home county. When h = d, meaning the worker lives and works in the home county, the ratio is 1. If agglomeration raises productivity, they should raise wages as well, and so a county d with a high level of agglomeration should attract more commuters from neighboring counties. Commuting distance from a home county h to a county d (DIST hd ) raises the cost of commuting, and so probability of commuting should decrease as distance increases. URB d indicates whether the commuting destination d is urban, and captures unobservable local factors other than our observed agglomeration measures that may influence commuting. FIRM d /FIRM h is the proportion of existing firms in county d relative to in county h. We add FIRM d /FIRM h to take out the effect of relative county size so that the relationship between agglomeration measures and commuting patterns is not just a reflection of county size. The error term, \u03b5 h, represents home-county-specific unobservable impacts, and is differenced away in the conditional logit estimation because it does not affect the relative utilities across counties.

First, our results can test several theories related to agglomeration economies for rural areas similar to Glaeser et al. (1992) did for urban areas. Our results imply that the most attractive areas for new firm entry are diverse economies with proximate upstream and downstream firms, an available educated workforce and a ready number of firms already in the sector. Our results support the various theories of local economic growth including Jacobs' (1969) importance of diversity, Porter's (1990) emphasis on clusters, Lucas's (1988) and Romer's (1986) endogenous growth based on concentrations of an educated workforce and Marshall's (1920) theory of proximate upstream and downstream firms. But we find no support for Marshall's and Schumpeter's (1942) view that monopoly opportunity invites entry in order to exploit first mover rents; in contrast, more competitive markets seem to induce firm entry.",

One of the key components in CPT is a persistent urban hierarchy; larger cities have more industries because higher ordered industries require higher demand thresholds. As mentioned in Mulligan et al. (2012), CPT does not have a sufficient dynamic explanation of how urban hierarchy persists. Our finding that agglomeration attracts new firm entry relative to less agglomerated markets means that the most agglomerated will get the largest annual infusion of new firms. Consequently, agglomeration economies are a key reason that the urban hierarchy persists.",

Glaeser and Gottlieb (2008) and Kline and Moretti (2014) argue that the finding of common agglomeration elasticities across areas cannot justify place-based government intervention. Our results also suggest that there is no additional advantage to agglomeration in urban areas relative to rural areas that have higher agglomeration endowments. However, rural communities that do not have a critical mass of firm clusters, upstream suppliers, downstream customers and educated labor will find it difficult to attract new start-ups. Policies aimed at encouraging new firm entry in dispersed small towns that lack agglomeration externalities would be much more expensive and will likely fail (Barkley and Henry, 1997). In addition, recruiting new firms that do not exist in the rural town would require additional costs because no incumbent firms in the industry would be a signal that the industry has no advantages in the town. The more promising strategy is to target new firm recruitment to the relatively few rural markets that have managed to foster sufficient agglomeration economies that they can attract both firms and commuting workers. 33 Coupled with policies to help lower the costs of commuting for rural workers in the more remote regions surrounding these towns, such as funding for childcare centers in rural areas, this strategy may also help reduce rural poverty .",
