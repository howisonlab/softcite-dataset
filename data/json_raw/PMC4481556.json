The common set of events in cyanide toxicity and vascular occlusion involves inflammatory and degenerative cascades starting from oxygen deprivation and ending in cell death. 4,5 Furthermore, metabolic changes induced in this cascade are a reflection of dysregulated mitochondria and extrinsic signaling pathways that leads to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and nitric oxide (NO). These alterations in metabolic and cellular processes also involve changes in the morphology of the cerebral blood vessels and blood flow pattern in the affected brain regions. 5,6 The blood supply of the brain is intriguing as the large arteries are connected by vast anastomotic network that dis-KEy WORdS Cyanide Ischemia Vascular occlusion Oxidative stress Stroke Glia Endothelium Blood vessel",

Ultramicroscopic. 5,8 Ultramicroscopic analysis of the structure of a single BBB unit reveals that the endothelial cells of the end arteries are linked via intercellular junctions to the ependymal astrocytes and tantacytes occupying the immediate surroundings of the arteries. 9 arteryies. 9 The matrix rich endothelium (charged molecules), surrounding astrocytes, neurons and blood cellsformthe structural, physiological and electrical barrier that controls the bi-directional movement of molecules across the blood-brain interphase. 4 The significance of such bi-directional flow has been described as regulatory as it is involved in homeostatic efficiency of regional circulation and metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS). 4,10 The importance of the endothelium as an integral part of the BBB has been emphasized. Previous studies have shown, using high magnification microscopy, that endothelial cells provide structural and physiological barrier at the interphase of neuron/glia and the circulating blood; such that toxins, nutrients, microbes, viruses and metabolitesin the blood come in contact with the endothelium before the cells of the nervous system. 11,8 Proliferative or degenerative changes in the endothelium have been linked with the progression of most degenerative diseases. This may involve changes in endothelial cells, adhesion molecules and matrix and is often the cause in brain infections, chemotoxicity and inflammation. 12 Recent studies have shown that bi-directional signals across the BBB actively modulate the pathophysiological process of degeneration in stroke, chemotoxicity and acute brain injuries. 4,11,13 An example of such cellular signal is the \"danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP)\" associated with the release of chemokines and cytokines into the blood after traumatic brain injury. As a result, a more robust immune response, resulting in inflammation is activated. 13,14 Interestingly, other studies have shown that the bi-directional communication between the ischemic or inflamed nervous system and the cells of the endothelium regulate the DAMP signal, and thus the progression of brain injuries. 10,15,16 Differential cellular mechanisms are involved in the progression of endothelial and neural changes induced by chemotoxicity and vascular occlusion. [17][18][19][20] Although acommon factor inthe progression of these models is oxidative stress, the pattern of endothelial/angiogenic response and how it affects the progression of degeneration and neurosurvival is yet to be elucidated. Generally, the induced oxidative stress has been described as a trigger of neuronal cell death, endothelial proliferation, glia activation, inflammation and in some cases proliferation in specific brain regions. 15,16,[21][22][23][24] In addition, our previous findings of glia activation, neuronal degeneration and proliferation induced by differential oxidative stress has revealed that regional differences exists in stress response elicited in the brain; specifically across the plastic and non-plastic brain regions. 25 Consequently, we investigated the effects of cyanide toxicity and vascular occlusion on the endothelial (CD31/CD45), neuron (NSE) and glia (GFAP) cells using Immunohistochemistryand stereology in cortical slices. We compared the effect of cyanide toxicity and vascular occlusion in the plastic periventricular zone (PVZ) and non-plastic parietal cortex (PC) in order to detect either proliferation (Ki-67) or degeneration (NF) relative to endothelial changes (CD31/CD45) after the treatment and withdrawal phases. Our findings demonstrate that endothelial changes are linked with glia activation, neuronal degeneration and proliferation. In addition, the observed changes vary for cyanide toxicity and vascular occlusion after the treatment and withdrawal periods.",

A group of n = 12 rats were treated with orally administered potassium cyanide (KCN) (30 mg/Kg body weight (BW) for 10 days using a gavage (CN). [26][27][28] A separate set of n = 12 animals was subjected to transient occlusion of carotid arteries, basilar artery and brachiocephalic vein using an elastic neck cuff. This was accompanied by a reduction of blood pressure above the neck cuff to 30 mmHg (VO). [29][30][31][32] The control (CO; n = 6) received normal saline for the total duration of the treatment phase (10 days). At the end of the treatment phase, n = 6 animals were sacrificed in the VO, CN and CO groups. Cyanide treatment and vascular occlusion was discontinued in the remaining n = 6 animals, each in the CN and VO treatments for the next 10 days (day 20). This represents the withdrawal phase and these groups were renamed CN-I and VO-I respectively. Author completed the IACUC training on Animal Use and a protocol number was already assigned to group (ABU13/Neu/008).",

Increase in thickness of the wall of the arteries was characteristic of vascular occlusion (Figure 1-VO; 0.09 cm) and can be attributed in part to the mechanical stress induced by the cuffs for the treatment duration. The artery was also characterized by a narrower lumen (0.0028 cm), when compared with the control (0.036 cm) ( Figure 1D). The effect of vascular occlusion in this group can be described anatomically as \"induced vascular resistance\" in the middle cerebral artery. The structural resistance observed in the global vascular occlusion treatment (VO) reduced after the withdrawal phase (VO-I). In the VO-I, the lumen/wall thickness ratio (LTR) increased significantly to 4.00 from the initial value (3.11) observed in the vascular occlusion treatment (Figure 1-VO-I). The increased LTR in this group corresponds to a reduction in wall thickness (0.008cm) and an increase in lumen width (0.032 cm; Figure 1D).",

The degenerative changes observed in the cells of the PVZ are similar to those of the cortical cells described above. It is important to note that the cells of PVZ often lack cellular projections; thus the adopted criteria for identifying degenerating cells in the PVZ excludes loss of cellular projections. The CN treatment group showed significant cell loss in the PVZ 13 when compared with the control. 24 The cell count increased in the withdrawal group for cyanide treatment (CN-I; 15) but was less than that seen in the control. Vascular occlusion (VO) induced minor degenerative changes in the PVZ with minimal cell loss 16 after the treatment phase. However, in the vascular occlusion treatment, no significant change in cell count was observed after the withdrawal phase (Table 1; Figure 2F). Generally, the distribution of degenerating neurogenic cells in vascular occlusion ( Figure 2A) and cyanide treatment ( Figure 2C) groups demonstrates the role of ischemia in induced degeneration in the plastic (PVZ)",

An increase in the tunica media/intima thickness was observed in VO and was accompanied by a decrease in lumen width. In cyanide toxicity, degenerative changes were observed in the tunica media/intima; consequently, a decrease in wall thickness and lumen width was recorded in this group. A common set of event in the CN and VO is the decrease in lumen width and an increase in vascular resistance shown by the lumen width/wall thickness ratio ( Figure 1D). After the withdrawal phase, regenerative changes such as increased lumen width, reduced vascular resistance and increased cell count were seen in the CN-I and VO-I. Degenerative changes were more pronounced in cyanide toxicity after the treatment phase with a LTR value of 2.44. Sequel After to the withdrawal of cyanide treatment in CN-I, the LTR value increased to 3.67 after the withdrawal phase, thus, a decreased vascular resistance ( Figure 1D). Similarly, after vascular occlusion, vascular resistance increased in the artery (3.11) when compared with the control (4.55) and decreased after the withdrawal phase (VO-I; 4.00). This further supports the change in lumen width observed in histology after the treatment (\u2193lumen width and \u2193LTR) and the improvement seen after the withdrawal phase (\u2191lumen width and \u2191LTR). (B) CD31 immunohistochemistry to demonstrate endothelial adhesion molecule PECAM-1 during endothelial proliferation in cyanide toxicity and vascular occlusion induced oxidative stress. Endothelial proliferation (\u2191CD31) was observed in cyanide toxicity (CD31 +++ ) and vascular occlusion (CD31 ++ ) after the treatment phase. Similar to our observations in the LTR and histology ( Figure 1A and 1D), a reduction in endothelial proliferation (\u2193wall thickness) was observed after the withdrawal phase. This was highly significant in CN-I (CD31 --) and was less significant in VO-I (CD31 + ) (C) Blood monocytes and phagocytes (CD45) were demonstrated around the artery to determine their role in pro-inflammation (treatment) and remodeling (withdrawal) during oxidative stress. Interestingly, VO (CD45 + ) and CN (CD45 ++ ) showed a significant reduction in monocyte expression when compared with the control (CD45 +++ ) signifying the noninvolvement of these cells in pro-inflammatory response. However, after the withdrawal phase, the expression of CD45/monocytes increased significantly in VO-I (CD45 +++ ) and no significant change was observed in CN-I (CD45 + ). Subsequent analysis reveals that CD45/monocyte expression was associated with post-ischemia remodeling and not inflammatory response in oxidative stress. Furthermore, the magnitude of vascular remodeling was more significant in vascular occlusion than cyanide toxicity (d) Pie chart representation of the wall thickness, the lumen width and the LTR.   and non-plastic (PC) brain areas. Interestingly, the results suggest a differential rate of degeneration for these brain areas. Specifically, we observed a higher cell loss in the PC than the PVZ for the same threshold of assaultin cyanide toxicity and vascular occlusion.",

The observed morphological alteration involved an increase in endothelial activation (CD31) accompanied by a reduction in monocytic expression (CD45) after the treatment phase. Interestingly, this was reversed in the withdrawal phase as endothelial activation reduced and monocytic expression increased. We have also shown that the magnitude of endothelial proliferation determines the extent of PC/PVZ degeneration or PVZ proliferation in chemotoxicity and vascular occlusion. Ultimately, we attributed these changes to glia activation (\u2191GFAP), coupled with an increased neuronal metabolic demand (\u2193NSE) in the cortex and PVZ. Although the observed change in neuron/glia metabolism and microvasculature of the brain during oxidative stress is believed to be a homeostatic response to balance oxygen supply and metabolism, however, certain differences were observed in the stress response generated in vascular occlusion, cyanide toxicity and the corresponding withdrawal groups.",

(2013) where endothelial progenitors were used as stimulants for angio-neurogenesis post ischemia induced by MCA occlusion. 37 In order to confirm neuronal cell proliferation, first we analyzed the distribution of neuron progenitors (NSE/Ki-67) in the PVZ and found that they were localized in the upper 2 or 3 layers of the PVZ. Subsequent analysis of the NSE/ Ki-67 progenitor cells show that further away from the PVZ, they assume a spindle shape and become polarized ( Figure 5F and 5G). In addition, they separate along the midline with two (2) cellular processes adjoining the two daughter cells ( Figure  5G) with the upper cell extending towards the subcortical area and the lower cell directed towards the upper cell layer of the PVZ ( Figure 5F). Interestingly, our previous study described such pattern of cell separation in neurogenesis using NSE immunolabeling to show proliferation in cells of the PVZ in vivo. It was observed that dividing neurogenic cells were characterized by two crus (limbs) around the separation ring and were oriented in opposite directions. 25 Since the neurogenic progenitor cells can divide to yield neuron and glia, we next distinguished gliogenesis from neurogenesis using the proposition by Robertson (2014). 38 This involved statistical comparison of the GFAP/ NSE count in the PC and PVZ, followed by a direct correlation with the Ki-67 count. We observed an increase in cortical Ki-67, most of which were restricted to the subcortical areas and mostly coincided with the location of glia cells (GFAP) rather than neuron (NSE) ( Table 2).",

The most predominant cell proliferation in the PC was astrocytic as seen by the GFAP/NSE ratio (Table 2). This trend also shows that oxidative stress reduced NSE in cortical degeneration and increased glia presence in these degenerating brain regions. Comparing the GFAP/NSE ratios, in the VO and CN showed that glia activation was higher than NSE expression in both treatment groups (CN-17.5 and VO-7.67).

This was associated with endothelial proliferation (\u2191CD31) and glia activation (\u2191GFAP) after the treatment phase, thus signifying degenerative and pro-inflammatory changes. However, the significance of degeneration was pronounced in cyanide treatment when compared with vascular occlusion. Subsequently, withdrawal of cyanide treatment and vascular occlusion induced a reduction in endothelial proliferation (\u2193CD31) and glia activation (\u2193GFAP). In addition, an increase in neuron count (\u2191NSE) and monocytic activity (\u2191CD45) was observed which is an indication of neurosurvival and vascular remodeling after this phase. Similarly, we recorded an increase in cell proliferation (\u2191Ki-67) and neurofilament deposition (\u2191NF) after the withdrawal phase. Degenerative changes were more significant in the PC than PVZ; also, PVZ showed an increase in cell proliferation after the withdrawal phase. Finally, cyanide toxicity improved better than the vascular occlusion after the withdrawal period.",
