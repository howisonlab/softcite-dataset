We evaluated minipigs as a potential alternative to NHPs to test the safety of this class of compounds. Four different phosphorothioated locked nucleic acid-based SSOs (3 antisense and 1 anti-miR), all with known safety profiles, were administered to minipigs using similar study designs and read-outs as in earlier NHP studies with the same compounds. The studies included toxicokinetic investigations, in-life monitoring, clinical and anatomic pathology. In the minipig, we demonstrated target engagement by the SSOs where relevant, and a similar toxicokinetic behavior in plasma, kidney, and liver when compared with NHPs. Clinical tolerability was similar between minipig and NHPs. For the first time, we showed similar and dose-dependent effects on the coagulation and complement cascade after intravenous dosing similar to those observed in NHPs. Similar to NHPs, morphological changes were seen in proximal tubular epithelial cells of the kidney, Kupffer cells, hepatocytes, and lymph nodes. Minipigs appeared more sensitive to the high-dose kidney toxicity of most of the selected SSOs than NHPs. No new target organ or off-target toxicities were identified in the minipig. The minipig did not predict the clinical features of human injection site reactions better than the NHPs, but histopathological similarities were observed between minipigs and NHPs. We conclude that there is no impediment, as default, to the use of minipigs as the non-rodent species in SSO candidate non-clinical safety packages."

Historically, the first key modification of therapeutic SSOs was the introduction of a phosphorothioated backbone, and more recent developments included modifications of the sugar moieties, eg, locked nucleic acids (LNAs). These modifications were shown to improve stability, target affinity and potency, and to reduce non-specific toxicities (Veedu et al., 2010;Vester and Wengel, 2004). Although numerous SSOs are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for various therapeutic indications, up to now only 2 SSO drugs have been approved (FDA Briefing Document, 2012; Perry and Balfour, 1999).",

            "text": "Upon parenteral administration, SSOs distribute broadly and are rapidly cleared from the circulation. After repeated dosing, they tend to accumulate in tissues, with the highest levels found in the kidney and liver, followed by lymphoid and other tissues, a characteristic observed across different mammalian species (Geary et al., 2015). SSO-mediated toxicities are categorized into Watson/Crick hybridization-dependent effects, caused by ontarget effect (exaggerated pharmacology) or off-target (secondary) pharmacology, and potential non-hybridization related toxicities (Frazier, 2015). SSO accumulation-related effects, proinflammatory effects or protein binding of the SSO may be examples of those hybridization-independent toxicities. In plasma, they may manifest as an acute and transient prolongation of coagulation and/or activation of the alternative complement system, particularly following intravenous administration in the non-human primate (NHP), upon reaching high plasma exposures (Crooke et al., 2016). In addition, renal tubular cell degeneration, glomerulonephritis, hepatic toxicity with increased serum aminotransferase activities, single cell necrosis of hepatocytes, as well as thrombocytopenia and injection site reactions (ISRs) after subcutaneous administration may be identified during preclinical and/or clinical investigations (Burdick et al., 2014;Engelhardt et al., 2015;Frazier, 2015;Henry et al., 1997;van Meer et al., 2016). These toxic effects may be hybridization-dependent or -independent and are generally sequence-specific and related to tissue exposures.",

As they are chemically synthesized, international guidelines for small molecules are followed that require repeat-dose toxicity studies to be conducted in both a rodent and non-rodent species (ICH M3[R2]) for advancing SSOs into the clinics. The selection of an appropriate animal species is essential in safety studies (Morton, 1998). Due to high genomic homology and pharmacokinetic similarities with humans, the cynomolgus monkey has been the nonrodent species of choice for the preclinical assessment of SSO safety and is considered predictive for identifying potential toxicities in humans.",

The minipig shows many similarities to human anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry (Forster et al., 2010). It is already widely used in the safety assessment of pharmaceuticals for topical dermal delivery as its skin resembles the human skin like no other non-rodent species does (Mahl et al., 2006). Given the high incidence of ISRs in humans receiving subcutaneous administrations of SSOs (van Meer et al., 2016), and the limited predictivity of rats and NHPs for these local effects identified clinically, we set out to investigate if the minipig could be a more predictive model for ISRs. To date only a scarce dataset on the use of the minipig in SSO safety assessment is publicly available. In single studies, SSOs were administered either intradermally (Cai et al., 2012), intravitreally (Danis et al., 2003), subcutaneously (Iyer et al., 2002), or topically (Mehta et al., 2000). With the recent sequencing of its genome (Heckel et al., 2015;Vamathevan et al., 2013), the minipig may now enable the design of cross-species reactive SSOs and the assessment of pharmacology-related adverse effects.",

After the dosing-free period, serum cholesterol concentration was low in 1 of the 2 animals previously dosed at 48 mg/kg; HDL and triglyceride levels were low in both minipigs. Decreases in cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride levels were expected pharmacodynamic effects of RTR3649. There were no relevant changes in cytokine levels."

It presented a marked acute body weight loss that corresponded with reduced food consumption and hypoactivity. The overall condition of this minipig was likely due to kidney changes, which were more severe than in the other animals of this group. In addition, a discoloration (flushing) of limbs, ears and snout was observed shortly after the last dosing which was attributed to complement activation. After repeated dosing, the majority of minipigs dosed at 45 mg/kg presented with a transient flushing of limbs, ears and nose immediately after dosing. A prolonged bleeding time after blood collection was also noted. Accordingly, transient and statistically significant increases in PT and APTT were observed at 45 mg/kg after the first dose, and this became more pronounced after the last dose (mean values were about 3.5 fold higher than baseline). By 24 h after dosing, effects on coagulation parameters had partially or totally resolved ( Figure 4A). Hematology changes observed at 45 mg/kg at day 16 were statistically significant (at least P < .05). A reduction in red blood cell (RBC; 11%) and lymphocyte counts (35%) and an increase in reticulocyte count (2.2-fold) were also observed.",

Not all nephrons were affected to the same extent.

Tubular regeneration was characterized by basophilic hypertrophied tubular cells with prominent enlarged nuclei and nucleoli and rare mitoses (as seen for RTR2996, Figure 5B). The subcapsular region of the cortex was more severely affected by the described lesions. The medulla was always unchanged.

Corresponding clinical signs, including prolonged bleeding and red discoloration of parts of the body, were also transient and reversed within a few minutes after administration. In NHPs, RTR2996 caused coagulation and complement activation; this has been described with other LNA SSOs (Henry et al., 2014;Hildebrandt-Eriksen et al., 2012;Koch and \u00d8rum, 2008) but has not previously been described in minipigs (Henry et al., 2016). In NHPs, activation of the complement system was reported with threshold SSO plasma levels of 70-80 lg/mL (Henry et al., 2014). In our minipig study, activation of the complement system was seen at plasma C max values of approximately 500 lg/mL RTR2996. Although this warrants more data, this finding could suggest a lower sensitivity of minipigs to this liability than NHPs and therefore possibly a higher relevance to human safety assessment since NHPs are known to be overpredictive (Henry et al., 2016). With the confirmed occurrence of acute PT and APTT prolongations after high intravenous doses in both species, this effect is likely also relevant in terms of human safety, even if clinical plasma peak concentrations are often below NHP thresholds (Crooke et al., 2016).",

The recent sequencing of the minipig genome was essential for considering the minipig as a potential alternative non-rodent species. As in NHPs, we showed dose-related target engagement, a pharmacodynamic effect and a decrease in LDL cholesterol after repeated dosing with RTR5001 in minipigs (Lindholm et al., 2012). PCSK9 mRNA expression in minipig livers was markedly reduced after RTR5001 administration, confirming pharmacodynamic activity, despite the single mismatch. In contrast, RTR4955 neither altered PCSK9 nor APOB mRNA nor cholesterol levels. These differences are likely due to different positions of the single mismatch to the minipig genome in the LNA SSO sequences. The central mismatch in RTR4955 is expectedly more detrimental on the target regulation than the end-standing mismatch in RTR5001, suggesting that for RTR4955, this region is critical for RNaseH recruitment and cleavage of target mRNA.",

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., 2017)  , 6, 11 and 16 1, 6, 11 and 16 1, 6, 11 and 16 1, 6, 11 and 16 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 28 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 kidney. Accumulation of LNA SSOs in the proximal tubular cells of the minipig kidney resulted in the presence of cytoplasmic basophilic granules, similar to that previously shown in rodents and NHPs (Frazier et al., 2014;Hildebrandt-Eriksen et al., 2012;Koch and \u00d8rum, 2008). Additionally, in the minipig, we observed degenerative changes of the renal tubular cells previously identified in NHP studies (Henry et al., 2012;Koch and \u00d8rum, 2008;Monteith et al., 1999). In the minipig, RTR3649 produced minimal to mild tubular degeneration in the kidney, whereas in NHPs, vacuolation of tubular cells was reported (Hildebrandt-Eriksen et al., 2012). In minipigs, RTR5001 produced degenerative/regenerative changes in the kidney; no adverse biochemical or histopathologic findings were observed in NHPs (Lindholm et al., 2012;van Poelgeest et al., 2013). In a human trial with RTR5001, one case of acute kidney injury was reported in a healthy volunteer who received three once-weekly doses of 5 mg/kg, with multifocal tubular necrosis/degeneration and evidence of drug accumulation (van Poelgeest et al., 2013) on biopsy. These findings were similar to those in minipigs given RTR5001. Degenerative/regenerative changes of the renal tubular cells were similar in minipigs and NHPs dosed with RTR4955 and RTR2996, although severity was greater with RTR4955 in the minipig. In addition, one minipig dosed with RTR4955 showed a mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, a lesion not previously observed in NHPs for the four LNA SSOs. Although no electron-dense deposits along the basal membranes were observed with TEM investigations, the lesion showed similar characteristics to those described previously (Frazier et al., 2014). Therefore, the pathogenesis-not fully clarified-may be related to a dysfunction of the alternative complement pathway. Regardless of the mechanism, minipigs may be more sensitive to kidney toxicity at high doses than NHPs. As commonly observed in NHPs and rodents, basophilic cytoplasmic granules were observed in the Kupffer cells in minipigs dosed with RTR3649 and RTR2996. Immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization showed this was due to SSO accumulation. Hepatocellular single cell necrosis/apoptosis, correlating with increased serum transaminase activities, were observed in minipigs administered RTR2996, in one minipig administered RTR5001, and another one administered RTR4955. Similar changes were seen in NHPs administered RTR4955 and RTR2996 (Koch and \u00d8rum, 2008;Straarup et al., 2010). In clinical studies, RTR4955 caused a mild increase in serum transaminase activities in some subjects, and a dose-limiting increase in serum transaminase activities occurred in two patients treated with RTR2996 4 mg/kg 3 times per week for two weeks (Tilly et al., 2007).",

Inflammatory changes were identified at the injection sites of control animals and minipigs administered RTR4955. Increased severity and incidence of hemorrhages were noted in RTR4955-dosed minipigs. RTR3649 caused perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration of mainly lymphocytes and eosinophilic granulocytes as well as necrosis at the injection sites in the minipig. However, as NHPs were dosed intravenously in the duration-matching study, a direct comparison cannot be made. Subcutaneous injection of RTR5001 and RTR4955 to NHPs caused inflammation, with predominant infiltration of neutrophils and formation of edema in the subcutis. In humans, SSOs are associated with ISRs of varying severity when administered subcutaneously (van Meer et al., 2016); lesion severity is dose-dependent, and some SSOs cause persistent lesions (van Meer et al., 2016;van Poelgeest et al., 2015). Consequently, although no overt ISRs were evident during the in-life phase in our preclinical studies, the histopathological examination of injection sites should still be considered, as data suggest similarities to reactions described in humans (van Meer et al., 2016).",

We demonstrated that the minipig shows a similar safety profile as the NHP for four different molecules upon subacute exposure. No additional off-target pharmacological effects or non-hybridization-dependent toxicities were identified. Consequently, the number of NHPs that are currently used in preclinical safety assessment of SSOs could be reduced. Finally, species selection should always maximize the likelihood of identifying responses that are similar to those expected in humans. Therefore, the design of respective cross-reactive SSOs to the minipig genome, as well as the pharmacologic activity and a similarity in the target distribution to humans is essential to ultimately select the minipig as the non-rodent species in preclinical safety investigation."
