            "text": "In recent years, genomics and proteomics have emerged as key technologies in biomedical research programs. These types of analyses are now critical to performing effective clinical research aimed at developing a better understanding of disease pathology, as well as designing new approaches for clinical treatment [1]. For example, as genomic technologies have matured, so have a growing number of examples of genomic profiles directly being used to create individualized treatment plans [2]. These include the use of relatively simple single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping for determining an appropriate treatment plan or for predicting the chemotherapeutic regimen most likely to benefit a breast cancer patient [3][4][5]. In addition, mass spectrometry, metabolomics and proteomics are becoming essential for providing sensitive methods of characterizing and analyzing both small molecules and proteins [6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. Both genomics and proteomics have proven so successful in these regards that demand has far exceeded the supply of trained personnel equipped to exploit the available technologies. This has resulted in a surge of interest in training by investigators keen to utilize these technologies in their research. The need for researchers trained in omics technologies has been described by several groups, including working groups from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [13]. In our own experience, the demand for training has been demonstrated at local, national and international levels. For example, in the past 8 years, previously established hands-on workshops in Metabolomics and Proteomics at National Jewish Health (NJH) and the University of Colorado School of Medicine (UCD) have been attended by over 400 individuals from around the world.",

            "text": "Several recent publications have focused on the need for experimental standards in omics research, especially when applied to human disease [14][15][16][17] and education is one means of lessening experimental error. To be of maximum benefit, education should ideally occur before experimental planning has begun, in order to decrease the possibility that the wrong platform, technology, experimental design or data analysis is chosen. For example, a first step toward utilizing omics technologies is the development of a well-defined hypothesis which clearly outlines the research question under investigation. If a researcher is interested in global expression patterns and/or biomarkers, he/she will need to determine if genomics, metabolomics or proteomics is more appropriate. Alternatively, an investigator may determine that a combination of approaches is necessary. Even after determining a general approach, the researcher must choose which specific platform and sample preparation strategies to utilize and this requires an understanding of the technologies available and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Given the plethora of equipment and protocols currently available, a new investigator could conceivably become overwhelmed by alternatives and subsequently make a poor choice that could lead to downstream difficulties in data analysis and interpretation. After determining an appropriate platform in which to test the hypothesis, careful experimental design and quality control measures are also critical to the success of the project as well as for interpreting the results. Given the large datasets generated by these technologies, knowledge of data analysis workflows and options, biostatistics and bioinformatics are vital and these are areas in which many investigators require additional training, specifically in the context of omics research. Finally, interpretation of omics results is dependent on a broad understanding of biochemistry and molecular biology, often presented within a knowledge-based pathway framework. Our training course exposed participants to each of these areas and, more specifically, enabled them to make informed decisions regarding the critical choice of platform for their particular research question.",

One salient feature of the course was the inclusion of over 20 faculty members with an array of experience spanning genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, biostatistics, mass spectrometry, genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, lung and heart disease, clinical studies, human research, and mouse and cell models. In addition, a number of vendors (Agilent Technologies, Affymetrix, Biorad and Pierce) provided laboratory module consumables as well as beverages, lunches and keynote speaker dinners for participants. Participants paid for their travel and housing expenses and a moderate $1000 tuition fee was charged to cover items not covered through the T15 award, including catering and keynote receptions.

The proteomics curriculum was carefully designed to maximize the retention of information and minimize student fatigue. Training material was presented in both lecture and laboratory session modules. Lectures and laboratory sessions were strategically interspersed throughout the 3 day period. Thus student training time consistently alternated between lecture and hands-on activities, thereby reducing mental fatigue and helping to keep students engaged. Lectures and laboratory sessions were ordered logically to reflect a typical workflow, i.e., sample preparation > data acquisition > data analysis. Lecture topics included introduction to mass spectrometry and database searching, quantitative proteomics, advanced technologies and clinical proteomics. During hands-on lab sections, students were divided into groups of three, making the student-to-instructor ratio 3:1. The composition of these groups was predetermined by experience level and remained the same throughout the entire course. This provided an element of consistency that helped students feel comfortable with the learning environment. It also enabled the laboratory instructor to tailor the session to meet the needs of the individual participants. For example, the instructor may spend additional time describing the individual components of a mass spectrometer to one group, but may discuss specific method parameters with another more experienced group. Laboratory sessions were divided into three stations and organized in a rotation-based format. Each group of three students spent 60-75 min per rotation at the following stations: sample preparation, instrumentation, informatics and data analysis. Over the course of the workshop, students returned several times to specific lab stations to continue and complete various aspects of sample preparation and instruction on mass spectrometry instruments and software. This rotation style format exposes students to a wide variety of proteomics and mass spectrometry concepts, while maintaining the continuity required to effectively experience an application-based workflow from sample preparation to data analysis.",

Of particular note is that of the 49 responders, 98% rated the course very good to excellent and 100% indicated that they would recommend the course to others. Ninety-eight percent of responders rated the quality of the workshop as very good to excellent. Impressively, 44% said that the workshop had had high impact on their research. As shown in Figure 3, responders who were frequently using specific techniques in their own laboratories, or through a core facility, more than quadrupled following the course. For example, only 10% frequently used genomics informatics techniques prior to the course, but over 50% frequently used these techniques following the course. This could indicate that education helped overcome a significant barrier in learning by exposing individuals to the techniques in a hands-on fashion. In addition to increased utilization of techniques, training apparently helped participants in other aspects of their work. Figure 4 shows the results to the question ''please indicate if you have used knowledge gained in the course in any of the following scenarios''. Almost all participants indicated that they had used knowledge gained in the workshop in reading journal articles (96%) and attending scientific meetings/seminars (94%). An impressive 76% indicated that the course had benefited them in terms of manuscript review, and almost half indicated the course had helped with non-NIH grant review and thesis review. This indicates that the course not only helped with research programs, but the knowledge gained was applied in a myriad of other ways, all of which have a direct positive impact on NIH-funded omics research.

To our knowledge, the described course constituted the only hands-on multi-omics course of its kind. As mentioned, the NHLBI provided significant funding to enable the presentation of the courses from 2007 to 2010 and hence no further courses are currently being held. Therefore, we have included additional information that could be of use to others in the field of omics education and training.",

            "text": "In the first year 43 individuals applied and 22 were admitted. In the second year, there were 48 applicants and 23 were admitted. In the third year, 27 applied and 20 were admitted into the course. In the fourth year, 28 applied and 22 were admitted. Due to the hands-on nature of the course, the course directors determined that 20-22 participants allowed individuals to receive experience on instrumentation while providing substantial one-on-one time with instructors. While lectureonly based courses could conceivably reach a larger audience, by definition they lack hands-on experience. The drop in demand from the last 2 years was attributed to several circumstances including a declining national economy that resulted in a decrease in overall scientific budgets. In addition, the course necessarily recruited investigators whose research focused on heart, lung and blood studies and our applicant pool was therefore limited. Members of industry were also not allowed to attend the course. Based on the number of inquiries between 2007 and 2010 from non-NHLBI investigators, and based on full capacity for current metabolomics and proteomics courses at NJH and UCD, it is the opinion of the authors that there is still a high demand for these types of hands-on courses.",
