            "text": "The mechanical property of extracellular matrix and cell-supporting substrates is known to modulate neuronal growth, differentiation, extension and branching. Here we show that substrate stiffness is an important microenvironmental cue, to which mouse hippocampal neurons respond and integrate into synapse formation and transmission in cultured neuronal network. Hippocampal neurons were cultured on polydimethylsiloxane substrates fabricated to have similar surface properties but a 10-fold difference in Young's modulus. Voltage-gated Ca 21 channel currents determined by patch-clamp recording were greater in neurons on stiff substrates than on soft substrates. Ca 21 oscillations in cultured neuronal network monitored using time-lapse single cell imaging increased in both amplitude and frequency among neurons on stiff substrates. Consistently, synaptic connectivity recorded by paired recording was enhanced between neurons on stiff substrates. Furthermore, spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic activity became greater and more frequent in neurons on stiff substrates. Evoked excitatory transmitter release and excitatory postsynaptic currents also were heightened at synapses between neurons on stiff substrates. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence to show that substrate stiffness is an important biophysical factor modulating synapse connectivity and transmission in cultured hippocampal neuronal network. Such information is useful in designing instructive scaffolds or supporting substrates for neural tissue engineering. I t is well-known that all types of cells are able to detect and respond to extracellular and intracellular chemical signals. Recent studies have evidence to suggest many cells including neurons in the brain are also equipped to sense mechanical cues from their microenvironments such as the stiffness or rigidity of extracellular matrix or cell-supporting substrates, and result in profound effects on their morphology and function [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] . For instance, substrates with stiffness similar to brain tissues prefer to stimulate neuronal over glial growth in cortical neuronal cultures 2 . The mechanical property of neuron-supporting substrates also exerts considerable influence on important neuronal behaviors; taking hippocampal neurons for example, stiff substrates promote dendrite arborization and, by contrast, soft substrates render weak adhesion that assists neurite outgrowth and/or retraction and thereby increase the frequency of extension-retraction events and neuronal dynamics 4,5,8 . Furthermore, there is increasing evidence to suggest that the physical properties of substrates can tune synapse formation and strength in cultured neuronal network although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood [4][5][6][7]9,13,14 . Brain injury or neurodegenerative disease can change local or global stiffness of the brain tissues, for example, local tissue stiffness is likely to increase after injury, as a result of formation of structures such as glial scars, and decrease in the brain tissues of patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis 15 . These and other studies have led to recognition of the mechanical property as an important factor in designing instructive scaffolds for neural tissue engineering [10][11][12] . A clear understanding of how the mechanical property of neuron-supporting substrates influences neuronal function is still lacking but important in inspiring a full insight into brain function and in particular development of novel neuron-supporting scaffolds for neural tissue engineering or regeneration 7,10,[12][13][14][15] . We carried out the present study to investigate the effects of substrate stiffness on Ca 21 signaling, synapse connectivity and transmission in cultured hippocampal neuronal network.",

Indeed, our two types of PDMS substrate preparations had similar surface roughness or topography as revealed using atomic force microscopy ( Fig. 1a), but a 10-fold difference in Young's modulus (46 6 11 kPa versus 457 6 39 kPa; n 5 6) as determined using the spherical indentation method (see Materials and Methods). We referred to them from here onwards as the soft and stiff substrates, respectively. Hippocampal neurons cultured on such substrates over a period of 14-18 days showed the typical size of cell body, morphology, neurite growth and extension. Neurites grew in all directions and with varying distances, and a high proportion of them made contacts with each other in the later stage ( Fig. 1b-d). Further characterization by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy using antibodies that recognize MAP2 (a neuronal marker), vesicular glutamate transporter (vGLUT1) (a marker of excitatory neurons using glutamate) or GAD67 (a maker for inhibitory neurons using c-aminobutyric acid or GABA) shows no difference in neuron density, soma size, and percentage of excitatory and inhibitory neurons on stiff and soft substrates ( Fig. 1c-e).",

            "text": "Cytosolic Ca 21 is a ubiquitous signaling molecule, and neurons express numerous Ca 21 signaling mechanisms that play a crucial role in determining and regulating their functional roles 17 . Voltage-gated Ca 21 channels mediating Ca 21 influx into the presynaptic terminals are particularly important for synaptic transmission 17,18 . Thus, we firstly examined the effect of substrate stiffness on voltage-gated Ca 21 channels in hippocampal neurons in culture for 8-10 days in vitro (DIV8-10), using whole-cell patch-clamp recording and Ba 21 as the charge carrier to avoid perturbance of Ca 21 -dependent mechanisms. Neurons cultured on both substrates responded to depolarization pulses with non-inactivating currents (Fig. 2a). The current-voltage (I-V) relationship curves were bell-shaped; the inward currents began to appear approximately at 230 mV, reached the maximum at 25 mV and reversed at 150 mV (Fig. 2b). The amplitude of inward currents in the voltage range from 215 mV to 115 mV was significantly greater in neurons on stiff substrates as compared to that in neurons on soft substrates (Fig. 2b). Similar increases in voltage-gated Ca 21 channel currents in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 pheochromocytoma cells ( Fig. 2c-d), a cell model for neuronal function. Taken together, these results suggest up-regulation of neuronal voltage-gated Ca 21 channels by stiff substrates.",

To further study the effects of substrate stiffness on synapse formation and function, we recorded spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC and sIPSC) from DIV14-18 neurons. The results are summarized in Fig. 4. There were significant increases in both amplitude and frequency of sEPSC in neurons on stiff substrates ( Fig. 4b-c) and by contrast no effect on sIPSC was detected ( Fig. 4e-f). We also determined the synaptic connectivity directly by paired recording (Fig. 5a) on the basis that action potentials (APs), induced by injecting currents into one (or presynaptic) neuron, evoke neurotransmitter release and subsequent postsynaptic currents in another synaptically coupled (postsynaptic) neuron. The average percentage of synaptic connectivity among neurons on stiff substrates was significantly greater than that among neurons on soft substrates (Fig. 5b). More specifically, stiff substrates increased both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connectivity (Fig. 5c). All the synaptic connectivity was completely abolished in extracellular Ca 21 -free solutions (data not shown), consistent with a critical role of Ca 21 influx in inducing synaptic transmission. We also examined the electrical coupling between neurons. The prevalence of electrical coupling and the coupling coefficient were not altered by substrate stiffness (Fig. 5d-f). Finally, we compared AP-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC), and also paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) or depression (PPD) that are often indicative of vesicular release probability (Pr) of neurotransmitters with a lower Pr resulting in a greater PPF or PPD value 25 . The cumulative distribution of postsynaptic currents shows that the size of evoked EPSC was increased significantly in neurons on stiff substrates relative to that in neurons on soft substrates (Fig. 5g). The PPF value was, as expected, significantly lower for neurons on stiff substrates (1.12 6 0.07) than on soft substrates (1.38 6 0.08; p , 0.05) ( Fig. 5h), consistent with enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission. In contrast, there was no change in evoked IPSC and PPD value ( Fig. 5i-j). Collectively, these results provide consistent evidence to show that stiff substrates preferentially enhance the excitatory synaptic connectivity and transmission in cultured hippocampal neuronal network.",

            "text": "The present study provides evidence to show that substrate stiffness strongly enhances voltage-gated Ca 21 channel currents, Ca 21 oscillations, synaptic connectivity, and excitatory neurotransmission in cultured hippocampal neuronal networks. As mentioned above, neurons express a diversity of Ca 21 signaling mechanisms that are important for brain functions 17,18,[25][26][27] , including presynaptic voltage-gated Ca 21 channels to mediate transmission at synapses, and synchronized Ca 21 oscillations in neuronal networks to determine neuronal plasticity. Diverse extrinsic chemical signals and intrinsic mechanisms exist at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites to determine or modulate synaptic formation and transmission 17,[22][23][24][25][26][27][28] . For example, expression of cadherin-9 is crucial for synapse formation between dentate gyrus and CA3 neurons in hippocampus 28 and neuropeptides via activation of distinctive Gprotein-coupled receptors can alter the amplitude and/or frequency of Ca 21 oscillations and thereby neuronal plasticity 23 . Emergent evidence suggests that the physical properties of neuron-supporting substrates are also influential. Thus, culturing neuronal stem celldifferentiated neurospheres on graphene, as opposed to tissue culture plastic surface, enhanced synchronized spontaneous Ca 21 oscillations and postsynaptic currents 14 . Stretching the membranes which supported cortical neurons significantly reduced spontaneous Ca 21 oscillations and excitatory postsynaptic currents 29 . The present study examined hippocampal neurons cultured on substrates with different stiffness, and revealed that the stiff substrates significantly upregulated Ca 21 signaling mechanisms, including voltage-gated Ca 21 channels (Fig. 2) and synchronized spontaneous Ca 21 oscillations (Figs. 3). More importantly, our study has shown that the stiff substrates enhanced synaptic connectivity and excitatory synaptic trans-mission ( Figs. 4-5). To our best knowledge, this is the first study to show that neurons can sense mechanical cues from their microenvironments and integrate into synapse connectivity and transmission. The increases in both Ca 21 channel activity (Fig. 2) and synaptic connectivity induced by the stiff substrates (Fig. 5b), and no detectable synaptic connectivity in extracellular Ca 21 -free solutions support the importance of Ca 21 signalling or presynaptic Ca 21 influx through voltage-gated Ca 21 channels. The stiff substrates also stimulated synchronized spontaneous Ca 21 oscillations in cultured neuronal network (Fig. 3), and facilitated excitatory synaptic connectivity and transmission (Fig. 4a-c, Fig. 5c and Fig. 5g-h). These findings are consistent with the notion that the Ca 21 oscillations result from periodic burst firing of APs engaging excitatory synaptic transmission via activation of L-type voltage-gated Ca 21 channels and excitatory NMDA receptors 19,22,23,30 . The excitatory GABA A receptors in the neonatal hippocampus have been reported to mediate the Ca 21 oscillations in synergy with NMDA receptors 19 . This study has shown that the stiff substrates also enhanced the inhibitory synaptic connectivity (Fig. 5c) but did not alter the inhibitory synaptic transmission ( Fig. 4d-f and Fig. 5i-j). Further investigations are required to determine the contribution of the excitatory and inhibitory receptors in mediating the increases in the Ca 21 oscillations and the discriminating effects on the excitatory versus inhibitory synaptic transmission. The increases in spontaneous Ca 21 oscillations on stiff substrates have also been documented in other cell types; for example, spontaneous cytosolic Ca 21 oscillations became more frequent in human mesenchymal stem cells when cultured on stiff polyacrylamide gel substrates or were amplified in endothelial cells when migrating from soft to stiff region of the substrates 31 . It is thus attractive to propose tuning the frequency and/or amplitude of cytosolic Ca 21 oscillations as a common intrinsic mechanism which cells use to encode the difference and/or change in the mechanical property of their microenvironments. Neurons examined in the present study were supported directly by the substrates based on visual examination (Fig. 1b). The stiff substrates increased the voltage-gated Ca 21 channel currents in cultured hippocampal neurons ( Fig. 2a-b) and similarly in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells ( Fig. 2c-d). Taken together, these results support expression of intrinsic mechano-sensing mechanisms in neurons. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that our hippocampal neuronal preparations like those used in many previous studies contained glial cells, and thus we cannot exclude the intriguing possibility that the glial cells have a role in sensing the mechanical cues and relaying to co-existing neurons. The PDMS substrates used in this present study are similar to those in previous studies, particularly those focusing on tissue engineering, and the substrate stiffness is much higher than the overall stiffness of brain tissues 2,15,16 . While it is important to determine the effects of changing the substrate stiffness occurring to the brain tissues on synaptic formation and function, the interesting finding reported in the present study is useful for the development of novel instructive scaffolds for neural tissue engineering.",

In addition, there is evidence suggesting that the effect of substrate stiffness on dendrite arborization is mediated by glutamate receptors 30 . More investigations are clearly required to identify the neuronal voltage-gated Ca 21 channels that are up-regulated by stiff substrates, and particularly elucidate the mechano-sensing mechanisms that enhance voltage-gated Ca 21 channel function, synaptic connectivity, excitatory synaptic transmission, and synchronized spontaneous Ca 21 oscillations we have reported here in cultured hippocampal neuronal network.",

In some experiments, extracellular solutions without CaCl 2 were used. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents were recorded with the membrane potential held at 270 mV for 5 min. AP-evoked postsynaptic currents and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) or depression (PPD) were determined by paired recording without capacitance compensation as previously described 18 . The presynaptic neurons were depolarized to 0 mV for 1 ms to elicit APs at 10-s intervals. The unitary postsynaptic currents were recorded from the paired postsynaptic neurons at a holding potential of 270 mV. 30 AP-evoked EPSC and IPSC were recorded from each neuron. Evoked EPSC and IPSC exhibited different decay kinetics, with average rise and decay times of 3 6 0.3 ms and 24 6 2.6 ms for EPSC (n 5 18), and 4 6 0.4 ms and 184 6 12.4 ms for IPSC (n 5 16), respectively. PPF was determined by evoking two EPSC at a 50-ms interval and PPD by evoking two IPSC at a 200-ms interval. To minimize the potential effects of spatial proximity on synaptic connectivity, paired recordings were made from a pair of neurons in the distance of 100-150 mm.",

The percentage of excitatory and inhibitory neurons was obtained by visually identifying the number of MAP2-positive and vGLUT1-positive neurons or MAP2-positive and GAD67positive neurons, and divided by the number of MAP2-positive neurons examined. The peak Ba 21 currents were normalized to the cell membrane capacitance and presented as current density. To determine the basal Ca 21 level and cytosolic Ca 21 oscillations, cells with the basal F340/F380 value within the average 6 2 3 standard deviation were included in analysis, and a Ca 21 spike was defined with its amplitude being .1.2 times of the basal level. The number of Ca 21 oscillation per minute and the changes in F340/F380 were used to calculate the frequency and amplitude. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents were analyzed using Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and Mini Analysis Progrom (Synaptosoft). The last 10 AP-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs were averaged to obtain the postsynaptic current amplitude which was used to construct the cumulative distribution as described previously 17 .
