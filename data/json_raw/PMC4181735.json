Methods: Nanoparticles were loaded with resveratrol by adsorption. The biological effects of the resveratrol-loaded nanoparticles were tested both in vitro, in a cell culture of RAW 264.7 cells (mouse macrophages), and in vivo, in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid model of rat colitis, when administered intracolonically. Results: The resveratrol liberation in 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) was characterized by fast liberation, reaching the solubility limit in 3 hours, which was maintained over a period of 80 hours. The in vitro assays revealed immunomodulatory properties exerted by these resveratrol-loaded nanoparticles since they promoted macrophage activity in basal conditions and inhibited this activity when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. The in vivo experiments showed that after evaluation of the macroscopic symptoms, inflammatory markers, and intestinal barrier function, the fibroin nanoparticles loaded with resveratrol had a better effect than the single treatments, being similar to that produced by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Conclusion: Silk fibroin nanoparticles constitute an attractive strategy for the controlled release of resveratrol, showing immunomodulatory properties and intestinal anti-inflammatory effects.",

            "text": "Chronic human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bleeding, due to ulceration of the inner lining of the colon and/or rectum. The aims of treatment are the remission of the symptoms during the acute flare (acute treatment) and control of the chronic inflammation to avoid or delay the occurrence of new flares (maintenance treatment). Although the etiology of IBD remains unclear, it is generally accepted that it occurs in genetically susceptible subjects, who develop an exaggerated immune response in the digestive tract against intestinal bacteria, which leads to chronic intestinal inflammation. 1 In consequence, control of the inflammation is the main target of the drugs used nowadays in the therapy of IBD, including aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants (glucocorticoids, azathioprine, metothrexate, and cyclosporine A), and biologicals (infliximab and adalimumab). However, adverse effects, an inconvenient dosing schedule and prohibitive price, in some cases, limit their long-term use. 2 For this reason, the development of new immunomodulatory therapies that combine efficacy, convenient dosing, and lesser side effects is an important goal in human IBD therapy.",

            "text": "Among the different approaches available for the therapy of IBD, one that has received considerable attention is the delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs in the affected colonic area through the use of nanoparticles. Different studies have indicated that nanomedicines are more beneficial than conventional medications regarding inflammation because nanoparticles have an increased ability to adhere to inflamed tissues compared with healthy ones, allowing better availability of drugs at lower concentrations and minimizing the risks of systemic action and adverse effects, with a general improvement of the efficacy. 3 Similar observations have also been made in the management of colon cancer. 4,5 In fact, the deposition and adherence of fluorescent polystyrene particles were greater in the ulcerated regions of the inflamed tissue than in nonulcerated control tissue in experimental models of rodent colitis; this adhesion was size-dependent, the best results being obtained with particle sizes ranging from 25 to 100 nm. 3 Based on this paradigm, different groups have developed the delivery of several drugs, such as tacrolimus and rolipram, delivered on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles; dexamethasone on poly(d-lactide) particles; 3 or fluticasone propionate on hydroxypropyl betacyclodextrin. 6 Currently, there are many biomaterials available for the fabrication of nanoparticles for drug delivery. Among them, fibroin, a polymeric protein present in the silk of the lepidopteran insect Bombyx mori L., has shown a set of remarkable properties, such as biocompatibility and a simple processing technology, which makes it adequate for this application. Fibroin has experienced an outstanding development in tissue engineering research as it can adopt a great diversity of configurations in the shape of films, hydrogels, sponges, and electrospun mats and fibers. 7 In addition, fibroin can be elaborated as micro-and nanoparticles, with excellent properties as vectors for drug delivery. [8][9][10] Many compounds can be encapsulated in fibroin particles, such as proteins, like insulin; 11 antitumorals, like paclitaxel; 12 and curcumin. 13 In addition, fibroin is highly biocompatible, and its degradation products from the action of proteases are peptides that are easily reabsorbed by the tissues. As a consequence, neither fibroin nor its byproducts produce an inflammatory reaction or an adverse effect. 14 Besides, fibroin is not only an inert drug carrier. The peptides resulting from its hydrolysis have shown therapeutic potential, for instance, in the stimulation of glucose transport in normal and insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes 15 or in the proliferation of fibroblasts in wound healing models. 11 Kim et al also reported the anti-inflammatory activity of fibroin peptides in a mice edema model of inflammation. 16 These effects were associated with the decrease of cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 levels in the inflamed tissue. In addition, silk fibroin has also shown beneficial effects on wound healing in vivo, 17 through upregulation and phosphorylation of c-Jun, a protein responsible for the migration of keratinocytes in wound healing models. 18 The aim of the present study was to test the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of fibroin nanoparticles (FNPs) loaded with resveratrol on the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) experimental model of rat colitis, which resembles human IBD. 19 The combination of the good qualities of fibroin as a delivery vector and the anti-inflammatory and healing effects of its peptides could enhance the therapeutic action of the drug. Resveratrol is a stilbene compound, present in many plant species, with excellent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antitumor properties 20,21 but with a low bioavailability, which could be improved by nanoparticle delivery. We tested the anti-inflammatory effects of FNPs, either unloaded or loaded with resveratrol, and compared them with a widely used anti-inflammatory drug, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Special attention was paid to their effects on the expression of some of the mediators involved in the inflammatory response, such as proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12), chemokines (cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant [CINC]-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1), and adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM]-1), as well as different markers of epithelial integrity in the mucosa, like the mucins MUC-2 and MUC-3, and the proteins trefoil factor (TFF)-3 and villin. In addition, the effects of resveratrol-loaded FNPs (RL-FNPs) were tested in vitro in RAW 264.7 cells (mouse macrophages). RL-FNPs showed immunomodulatory properties and had a better intestinal anti-inflammatory effect than the single treatments, being similar to that obtained with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone.",

During and after TNBS administration, the rats were kept in a head-down position until they recovered from the anesthesia and were then returned to their cages. Rats from the noncolitic group were administered, intracolonically, 0.25 mL of PBS, instead of TNBS. The four treatments described were administered from the day following the colitis induction until the day before the death of the rats, which took place 8 days after the induction of the colonic damage. All the rats were killed with an overdose of halothane. The animal body weights, occurrence of diarrhea, and water and food intake were recorded daily throughout all the experiments. Once the animals had been killed, the colon was removed aseptically, placed on an ice-cooled plate, opened longitudinally, and cleaned of its luminal contents with cold saline. Afterwards, the colonic segment was weighed and its length measured. Each colon was scored for macroscopically visible damage, on a 0-10 scale, by two observers unaware of the treatment, according to the criteria previously reported. 25 Then, the colonic samples were sectioned in different longitudinal fragments to be used for biochemical determinations or for RNA isolation. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured according to the technique described by Krawisz et al and the results were expressed as MPO units per gram of wet tissue; one unit of MPO activity was defined as that degrading 1 \u03bcmol hydrogen peroxide/min at 25\u00b0C. 26 The total glutathione content was quantified with the recycling assay described by Anderson, and the results were expressed as nmol/g wet tissue. 27 For the analysis of gene expression in colonic samples by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the total RNA from colonic samples was isolated using Trizol \u00ae , following the manufacturer's protocol. All RNA samples were quantified with a Thermo Scientific Nano-Drop\u2122 2000 Spectrophoto meter (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA), and 2 \u03bcg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using Oligo (dT) Primers (Promega Corp). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and detection were performed on optical grade, 48-well plates in an Eco\u2122 Real-Time PCR System (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), with 20 ng of complementary (c)DNA, the KAPA SYBR \u00ae FAST qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA), and specific primers at their annealing temperature (Table 1). To normalize messenger (m) RNA expression, the expression of the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was measured. The mRNA relative quantitation was calculated using the comparative CT (\u2206\u2206Ct) method. 28 statistics All results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences between means were tested for statistical significance using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc least significance tests. Differences between proportions were analyzed with the chi-squared test.

Considering a volume of 25 mL of PBS, 0.5 mg of resveratrol was released initially until medium saturation was reached.

In addition, resveratrol was also able to significantly increase the nitrite production in basal conditions, when compared with the corresponding control, although no concentration-dependent effect was obtained. When RAW 264.7 macrophages were incubated with LPS, enhanced production of nitrite took place, as well as its accumulation in the culture media, due to increased expression of iNOS in these cells ( Figure 5B). The pretreatment with resveratrol-unloaded nanoparticles did not significantly modify nitrite levels in comparison with control conditions, whereas RL-FNPs, at concentrations of 250 and 500 \u03bcg/mL, were able to reduce nitrite production. This inhibition was similar to that obtained when resveratrol was assayed at the lowest concentration studied but lower than those achieved when the macrophages were incubated with higher concentrations of resveratrol ( Figure 5B).",

The treatment of the colitic animals with the nanoparticles, alone or resveratrolloaded, was associated with a significant reduction of the activity of the colonic MPO, probably due to a lesser infiltration of leukocytes into the inflamed tissue (Table 3). However, it is important to note that the reduction was significantly higher when the nanoparticles were loaded with resveratrol, showing a similar activity to dexamethasone (Table 3). At the same time, the treatment with the RL-FNPs significantly increased the glutathione content, which indicates an improvement of the altered oxidative state that was the result of the inflammatory process induced by the TNBS, showing significant differences from the group of animals that received the unloaded nanoparticles. Again, this effect was similar to that observed in the group of rats that received dexamethasone (Table 3). The analysis of the markers related to the alteration of the immune response (and associated with the intestinal inflammatory process) showed that the treatment of the colitic animals with the RL-FNPs significantly reduced the expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-12, with an efficacy similar to that of the group receiving dexamethasone, except for IL-12 ( Figure 6).

            "text": "The results described in the present study indicate that it is possible to encapsulate the stilbene resveratrol in nanoparticles made from silk fibroin. This encapsulation results from the adsorption of the drug onto the surface of the particles. Given that resveratrol has a small charge, the EE of about 13% is quite low in comparison with other encapsulation approaches and materials for this compound. 31 However, even at this low level of encapsulation, the loaded nanoparticles showed a significant and remarkable biological effectboth in vitro, in a macrophage cell line, and in vivo, in a rat model of experimental colitis. The in vitro assays revealed the immunomodulatory properties of the FNPs when they contained resveratrol, since only in this case were they able to both promote the macrophage activity when the cells were in basal conditions, and inhibit it when stimulated with LPS. These effects are similar to those found when resveratrol was tested alone in these in vitro assays. In fact, previous studies have reported that resveratrol, although slightly enhancing iNOS mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner, decreased nitric oxide production in activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. 32 The in vivo experiments show that the daily intracolonic administration of 1 mg of resveratrol encapsulated in 8 mg of FNPs per rat had an intestinal anti-inflammatory effect in the experimental model of rat colitis induced by the intracolonic administration of the hapten TNBS, this effect being similar to that obtained with the intrarectal administration   of dexamethasone -a glucocorticoid used as a positive control, and one of the therapies available for the treatment of human IBD. 33 Previous study has reported the intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of resveratrol in this experimental model of rat colitis. 21 However, our study reveals that the incorporation of this compound into FNPs resulted in an improvement of its biological properties because the effect observed with RL-FNPs was greater than that obtained when the resveratrol or the nanoparticles were administered alone, suggesting a synergistic action in the encapsulated product. It is important to note that the FNPs cannot be considered as an inert carrier in experimental colitis since they had an intestinal anti-inflammatory effect, thus confirming previous observations with this biomaterial, both in vivo and in vitro. 16,18 The synergistic effect obtained in the RL-FNPs was evidenced macroscopically since the lowest damage score was obtained in this group of colitic rats. It is noteworthy that the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects were related to the better recovery of the colonic tissue produced by the treatments in comparison with the colitic control; this ruled out a preventative effect of the treatments since the administration of the different test compounds only started once the damage had been induced. The higher efficacy obtained with RL-FNPs was also demonstrated biochemically as a significantly lower reduction in colonic MPO activity in comparison with the colitic groups receiving resveratrol or the nanoparticles alone, probably related to a reduction of neutrophil infiltration and thus demonstrating the superior intestinal anti-inflammatory effect of the treatment. 34 Moreover, it is precisely in this group of animals where the anti-inflammatory effects were associated with a significant improvement in most of the markers related to the alteration of the immune response resulting from the intestinal injury induced by the TNBS. 35 In fact, RL-FNP administration was the only treatment able to significantly inhibit the expression of all the cytokines evaluated, namely TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-12. This may be relevant since the expression of these proinflammatory cytokines has been reported to be increased in human IBD, and the effect of these cytokines on the intestine has been directly related to the induction of tissue injury and/or destruction. 36 Closely associated with the improvement in the immune response produced by the different treatments are their effects on the chemokines CINC-1 and MCP-1 as well as on the adhesion molecule ICAM-1, which could be responsible for the lower neutrophil infiltration (which in turn, coincided consistently with the lower activity of colonic MPO obtained with the treatments) and the decline in monocytes/macrophages in the inflamed tissue. This could play a key role in the intestinal anti-inflammatory effect because it has been well described that in the first steps of the gut inflammation, margination and extravasation of circulating leukocytes probably result in the perpetuation of the inflammatory process. 37 Also of note is the significant effect of the more active treatments, RL-FNPs and dexamethasone, on the improvement of the intestinal epithelium barrier function, as evidenced by increased expression of the mucins MUC-2 and MUC-3, the primary constituents of the colonic mucus layer, 38 and of TFF-3 and villin, the bioactive peptides involved in epithelial protection and repair. 39,40 This can be key to explaining the greater anti-inflammatory effect obtained with RL-FNP treatment in comparison with free resveratrol and unloaded nanoparticles -this could be one of the mechanisms that promotes the mucus-secreting layer that covers the epithelium and acts as a physical barrier, protecting its integrity and making possible a faster recovery of the injured colonic tissue. Epithelial barrier function impairment is considered as one of the initial steps in intestinal inflammation that facilitates the access of antigens from the intestinal lumen and hence, generates an exacerbated immune  response. This effect seems to be of special relevance since it has been stated recently that mucosal healing is a key prognostic parameter in the management of IBD; in fact, mucosal healing has emerged as a key treatment goal in IBD that predicts sustained clinical remission. 41 ",

This is even more the case when one considers first the low bioavailability of resveratrol, both in animals and humans, and second, its low water solubility, which hinders its administration since it would need the use of an organic solvent (ie, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetone, or ethanol) that is not suitable for drug delivery. However, further studies, to improve its stability during gastric passage and to delay drug release to the distal intestine, are needed in order to allow the oral administration of this nanoparticulate formulation.",
