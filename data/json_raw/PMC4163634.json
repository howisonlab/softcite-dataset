            "text": "Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements are high-order RNA structures that promote internal initiation of translation to allow protein synthesis under situations that compromise the general cap-dependent translation mechanism. Picornavirus IRES elements are highly efficient elements with a modular RNA structure organization. Here we investigated the effect of Mg 2+ concentration on the local flexibility and solvent accessibility of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) IRES element measured on the basis of selective 2 0-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) reactivity and hydroxyl radical cleavage. We have found that Mg 2+ concentration affects the organization of discrete IRES regions, mainly the apical region of domain 3, the 10 nt loop of domain 4, and the pyrimidine tract of domain 5. In support of the effect of RNA structure on IRES activity, substitution or deletion mutants of the 10 nt loop of domain 4 impair internal initiation. In addition, divalent cations affect the binding of eIF4G, a eukaryotic initiation factor that is essential for IRES-dependent translation that interacts with domain 4. Binding of eIF4G is favored by the local RNA flexibility adopted at low Mg 2+ concentration, while eIF4B interacts with the IRES independently of the compactness of the RNA structure. Our study shows that the IRES element adopts a near-native structure in the absence of proteins, shedding light on the influence of Mg 2+ ions on the local flexibility and binding of eIF4G in a model IRES element.",

            "text": "RNA structure plays a fundamental role in biological processes guided by RNA regulatory elements [1,2]. As for most RNA regulatory elements, the RNA structure dictates the function of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) [3][4][5]. IRES elements, which were discovered in picornavirus genomic RNAs, are in charge of driving translation initiation in various RNA viruses and a subset of cellular mRNAs [6][7][8]. Indeed, IRES-driven translation initiation represents an alternative mechanism to start protein synthesis under situations that compromise cap-dependent translation initiation, typically occurring in infected cells. However, under normal situations, most eukaryotic mRNAs initiate translation by a mechanism that depends on recognition of the m 7 GpppN residue (termed the cap) located at the 5 0 end of most mRNAs [9].",

This methodology has the advantage over other high-resolution approaches of allowing analysis of long RNA molecules and providing information at single-nucleotide resolution [18]. Our studies have shown that domain 3 is a self-folding region that harbors conserved motifs whose disruption impairs IRES activity. These motifs have been proposed to be involved in distant interactions on the basis that altering one of them affects the RNA structural organization of this domain, leading to defective IRES elements [19][20][21]. However, threedimensional models of the picornavirus IRES RNA structure are not yet available. Although a high Mg 2+ concentration inactivated the IRES-dependent activity in cell-free lysates of the closely related encephalomyocarditis virus [22], the influence of divalent cations on the IRES structure, and, in particular, whether the concentration of Mg 2+ ions affects the binding of factors needed for IRES activity, are unknown.",

In the case of the FMDV IRES, long-distance RNA-RNA interactions were dependent on the concentration of the divalent ion in the folding buffer [19,25]. Cations reduce the charge repulsion generated by phosphate anions of the backbone, stabilizing the folded conformation of RNA [26]. It is well established that Mg 2+ , which has a high charge density, is the dominant divalent cation in biological systems [24]. Moreover, Mg 2+ ions perform both catalytic and structural roles, including mediation of helical packaging, promotion of long-range interactions, and stabilization of RNA motifs [27].",

            "text": "Magnesium ions determine the RNA structure of discrete IRES regions This study was designed to investigate the conformation of the IRES element under various ionic conditions. To this end, in vitro-synthesized RNA containing the functional FMDV IRES (nucleotides 1-462) upstream of the luciferase coding region (Fig. 1A) was denatured, snapcooled, and renatured in folding buffer under a range of MgCl 2 concentrations, keeping the buffer concentration (HEPES pH 8, 100 mM) and monovalent cation concentrations (NaCl, 100 mM; KCl, 140 mM) constant. This procedure was followed to minimize intermolecular interactions, release mis-folded molecules from kinetic traps and promote the most stable secondary structure. Refolded RNA was treated with N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA), which preferentially acylates the 2 0 -OH of riboses associated with conformational flexible nucleotides [29]. Heavily modified positions correspond to nucleotides that are primarily single-stranded, while non-reactive nucleotides are involved in base pairs. Inflexible regions may also correspond to non-WC base pairs, tertiary interactions, or a single stacking interaction in the C2 0 -endo conformation [30,31]. After NMIA treatment, the IRES region was examined by reverse transcriptase extension using primers spaced along the RNA sequence to obtain overlapping readings [3]. Then, cDNA products derived from the untreated and NMIAtreated RNAs were resolved in denaturing acrylamide urea gels in parallel with a sequence ladder obtained using the same primer (Fig. 1B). Gross modifications of SHAPE reactivity where observed in specific regions of domains 3 and 4 of the IRES folded at low Mg 2+ concentration (0.5 mM) compared with RNA folded at high Mg 2+ concentration (6 mM). Compared with the absence of Mg 2+ in the folding buffer, the apical region of domain 3 showed a decreased SHAPE reactivity in residues 200-202 in the presence of 0.5 and 6 mM Mg 2+ (Fig. 1B, left panel, black arrowheads). Likewise, a decrease in reactivity at positions 337-348 within domain 4 was observed at high Mg 2+ concentration (Fig. 1B, right panel, black arrowheads).",

However, no information was available regarding the 10 nt loop of domain 4. Alignment of the IRES sequences from 180 FMDV isolates available in GenBank indicated that the sequence of the 10 nt loop at nucleotides 337-348 is conserved, with the exception of C343 and C345, which tolerated transitions and transversions (A or U and U or G, respectively) ( Fig. 5A). Occasional substitutions were observed at positions U338 and A347. Indeed, a conserved motif GUAACANGN-GAC(337-348) was inferred from sequence conservation. In contrast, flanking nucleotides that are engaged in base pairs according to SHAPE probing ( Fig. 2A) were either invariant or covariant ( Fig. 5A). Thus, to obtain information about the implication of the 10 nt loop at nucleotides 337-348 on IRES activity, we generated two mutants. The first one (D338-347) carried a deletion of the entire loop, and the second one (A339C/A340G) carried a double substitution that was intended to close the loop (Fig. 5B). Determination of the efficiency of internal initiation of translation of these mutants relative to the wild-type IRES showed a decrease of activity of approximately 80% (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that the 10 nt loop of domain 4 contributes to IRES activity to a significant extent. Assembly of eIF4G-IRES and eIF4B-IRES complexes reveals the protection of specific residues in domains 4 and 5",

Primer extension analysis of the complexes assembled in vitro allowed measurement of the SHAPE reactivity of the IRES region in RNA incubated with or without eIF4G (Fig. 6A, lanes 2-4). Relative to the SHAPE reactivity observed with free RNA, eIF4G protein induces the protection of sequences that lie within domain 4 of the IRES. Specifically, nucleotides 400-418 were protected from NMIA attack upon addition of His-tagged eIF4G at low Mg 2+ concentration (blue bar/box in Fig. 6A,B). These results are in agreement with independent approaches, such as assembly of 48S pre-initiation complexes and RNA-protein pull-down and UV-crosslink assays performed using a range of Mg 2+ concentrations between 0.3 and 2.5 mM, which mapped the binding site of eIF4G to domain 4 of the encephalomyocarditis virus and FMDV IRES elements [16,[35][36][37][38]. In addition, nucleotides 340-350 were reorganized upon addition of the protein, with noticeable changes in the primer extension pattern (Fig. 6A,B, blue bar/ box). However, residues 75, 293-303 and 447-454 were more reactive towards NMIA (Fig. 6B, red  concentration (Fig. 6C). These results led us to conclude that eIF4G-IRES interaction is sensitive to the RNA structure reorganization induced by divalent cations.",

Interestingly, the hairpin of domain 5 (nucleotides 416-433) was protected by eIF4B from NMIA attack at both low and high Mg 2+ concentrations (blue boxes in Fig. 7B,C). In contrast, two short regions spanning nucleotides 293-297 (domain 3) and 447-454 (domain 5) became more reactive towards NMIA (red boxes in Fig. 7B,C). Residues belonging to domain 3 showed no gross changes in SHAPE reactivity with the exception of positions 179-180, while nucleotides 53-66 within domain 2 were protected. These results show that eIF4B specifically induces protection of residues belonging to domains 2 and 5. It is worth mentioning that specific residues were differentially protected upon incubation of the IRES with eIF4G or eIF4B at low Mg 2+ concentration (Fig. 8). For instance, while eIF4G-IRES complexes protect residues within domain 4 (blue-shaded nucleotides in Fig. 8A), complexes assembled with eIF4B preferentially protect the hairpin of domain 5 (blueshaded nucleotides in Fig. 8B). However, in both cases, a reorganization of flanking sequences within the pyrimidine-rich region of domain 5 and the basal region of domain 3 (red-shaded nucleotides in Fig. 8A,B) was observed, suggesting that these residues are in close proximity in the three-dimensional structure of the IRES.",

In this assay, in situ-generated hydroxyl radicals cleave locations on the RNA backbone in proportion to their solvent exposure [40]. The solvent accessibility of the IRES was probed using Fe(II)-EDTA and H 2 O 2 in a solution of RNA renatured in the presence or absence of Mg 2+ , followed by primer extension analysis with fluorescently labeled primers, and capillary electrophoresis was used to resolve the reaction products. The results yielded cleavage information at single-nucleotide resolution, indicating solvent exposure of the 3 0 end region of the IRES (Fig. 9A). Upon folding of the RNA in the presence of high concentrations of Mg 2+ , the hairpin of domain 5 became solvent-inaccessible ( Fig. 9B, gray nucleotides) indicating burial of this region due to structural compaction. Concomitantly, a change in accessibility to the solvent for residues within the 10 nt loop of domain 4 was observed (Fig. 9B, compare gray and purple nucleotides in left and right panels). Thus, the basal region of domain 4 and most of domain 5 remain solvent-inaccessible at high Mg 2+ concentration. These results, together with those shown in Figs 4, 5 and 6, suggest that eIF4B interaction with the IRES is independent of the compactness of the IRES structure, while binding of eIF4G is favored by RNA flexibility in this region, probably provided by a solvent-accessible hairpin of domain 5.",

In this regard, recent SHAPE structural studies have provided information on various RNA conformations, tertiary structures, long-distance 3 0 ?5 0 interactions and ribonucleoprotein complexes of RNA in solution [42][43][44][45].",

This was performed as an unbiased method to detect base pairs between nucleotides that resulted in modified reactivity upon Mg 2+ incubation. However, no gross changes in stem-loop composition were detected irrespective of whether the full-length IRES, individual domains or combinations of its structural domains (4-5, 3-4-5 or 2-4-5) were used.

Attempts to identify candidate base pairs involving residues of the 10 nt loop of domain 4 did not detect a second site at which reactivity decreased to the same extent under high Mg 2+ concentration. Given the difficulties of predicting non-canonical base pairs in the RNA structure, it is possible that residues involved in long-range interactions were missed if either non-canonical base pairs or internal bulges were involved. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that a high Mg 2+ concentration stabilizes intra-loop interactions [52,53], potential pairing of nucleotides GUAACACGCGAC(337-348) with positions CUCGGUUUA(390-398) was identified. Interestingly, this is partially coincident with the protection of residues UUUAAAAAAG(397-403) by eIF4G at 0.5 mM Mg 2+ concentration but not at 6 mM. Thus, recognition of the eIF4G-binding site at low mM Mg 2+ may be at least in part favored by a more flexible RNA structure due to lack of this putative tertiary interaction.",

Both mutants showed a reduction in internal initiation activity of approximately 80% relative to the wild-type IRES, suggesting that A339 and A340 perform critical roles in the contribution of this loop to IRES activity. In support of these data, we have found that this particular region is reorganized upon addition of eIF4G, and that the eIF4G-IRES interaction is sensitive to the RNA structure reorganization induced by divalent cations. This result has important implications given that the concentration of Mg 2+ in the cellular cytoplasm is approximately 0.5-1 mM [54]. Interestingly, although K + is the predominant monovalent cation in the intracellular environment, we found that Mg 2+ concentration determines RNA structure irrespective of which monovalent ion (Na + or K + ) is used, in agreement with previous data [23]. Furthermore, the low RNAbinding affinity of eIF4G [55] may explain the moderate protection of eIF4G in the absence of other factors such as eIF4A, PTB and Ebp1 [16].",

A total of 180 sequences available in GenBank were aligned using CLUSTALX. For simplicity, one representative of each variant is shown in the alignment. The pattern of nucleotide conservation (measured in bits) of the 10 nt loop of domain 4 is represented by a sequence logo obtained from alignment of nucleotides 337-348 (boxed in red). (B). Mutational analysis of the 10 nt loop of domain 4. The secondary structure of the wild-type (wt) stem-loop as well as the deletion mutant (D338-347) and the substitution mutant (A339C/A340G) are shown at the top. Relative IRES activity was determined as the ratio of luciferase to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expressed from a bi-cistronic construct in transfected BHK-21 cells and normalized to the activity observed for the wild-type IRES (set to 1). Values are means AE SD. The experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. 3691 FEBS Journal 281 (2014) 3685-3700 \u00aa 2014 The Authors.
