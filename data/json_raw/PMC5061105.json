Methods: The acquisition is based on steady state free precession MR fingerprinting with a Cartesian trajectory. To increase the sensitivity to the B1 profile, abrupt changes in flip angle were introduced in the sequence. Slice profile and B1 effects were included in the dictionary and the results from two-and three-dimensional (3D) acquisitions were compared. Acceleration was demonstrated using retrospective undersampling in the phase encode directions of 3D data exploiting redundancy between MRF frames at the edges of k-space. Results: Without B1 estimation, T2 and B1 were inaccurate by more than 20%. Abrupt changes in flip angle improved B1 maps. T1 and T2 values obtained with the new MRF methods agree with classical spin echo measurements and are independent of the B1 field profile. When using view sharing reconstruction, results remained accurate (error <10%) when sampling under 10% of k-space from the 3D data. Conclusion: The methods demonstrated here can successfully measure T1, T2, and B1. Errors due to slice profile can be substantially reduced by including its effect in the dictionary or acquiring data in 3D.",

Quantitative changes in longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxa-tion times in discrete brain regions have been described in a host of different pathologies (1). However, reproducibility for quantitative MRI measurements has proved a challenge and requires lengthy scan times to obtain parameters sequentially. Consequently, quantitative parameters are rarely acquired, and most evaluations of MRI images are based on visual inspection without quantitative evaluation of underlying values of T1 and T2.",

Briefly, an inversion pulse is applied before a train of fast imaging with steady state precession readouts with variable flip angles and repetition time delays. These rapid changes prevent a steady state from being achieved, but rather lead to signal variations dependent on local magnetic properties and the applied B1 field. Phase encoding is applied before each readout and rewound afterward so that each train of readouts has the same phase encoding value and the whole sequence is repeated for each phase encoding step. In our implementation, we used a train of 1000 frames taking 10 s to acquire a single k-line for all frames. To allow for return to equilibrium, we inserted a delay of 5 s before repeating the acquisition with a different level of phase encoding.",

The extended phase graph simulation was performed for the central flip angle of each of the 128 partitions producing an MRF train for each. The signal of each frame was summed over each partition to create a dictionary for each pulse waveform that takes account of the variability in flip angles experienced across the slice.

Our new method, as a result of abrupt changes in flip angle, was able to better discriminate between these parameters.

T1 measurement is accurate for MRF methods across the slice, where the spin-echo measurement is inaccurate away from the center. Without modeling B1 in the dictionary, MRF overestimates the T1 value. For T2 and B1, results are similar to Figure 4 with confounded estimates unless abrupt flip angle changes are introduced into the scheme. Figure 8 compares the different approaches to deal with undersampled data, and it can be seen that viewsharing significantly outperforms the other methods. A comparison of the view-sharing method on 8% kspace with a time-matched acquisition fully acquiring just the first 80 MRF frames revealed that spatial undersampling has a high efficiency. A view sharing method using only 8% of k-space gave lower errors (DT1 \u00bc 35 ms; DT2 \u00bc 4 ms; RMS compared with full) than a time-matched comparison using only the first 80 elements of the MRF sequence (DT1\u00bc 450 ms; DT2\u00bc 50 ms; RMS compared with full).",

Resid-ual errors in T2 are likely due to nonideal behavior of the RF transmission pipeline. To check this, we used actual flip angle imaging (16) to measure the mean flip angle in a uniform phantom achieved when different pulse shapes were used. The measured flip angles were found to be factors of 1.07 for sinc, 1.06 for hermite, and 0.96 for gauss pulses. Introducing these factors for flip FIG. 9.

The undersampled sets agree well with the fully sampled dataset. angles into the dictionary reduced the errors but further investigation of imperfect RF transmission was beyond the scope of this study. The adverse effects of slice distortion can be largely mitigated when selecting a large slab for 3D imaging, as in this case the slice profile problem becomes part of the B1 estimation. When estimating parameters through the slice, we saw unbiased results with our new method. However, we still observed underestimation of T2 in the outermost partitions. Future acquisitions with nonselective pulses could offer a better solution for an extended coverage. Previous work in the context of radial k-space acquisition found that 3D scans offer more possibility of undersampling the k-space with respect to 2D slices (17). Another advantage of 3D imaging is its applicability to brain imaging cohort studies. Brain imaging methods to compare groups of subjects usually benefit from isotropic 3D acquisitions to meaningfully compare regions after image registration (18). In addition, whole-brain coverage can be achieved in a single acquisition when using 3D MRF methods.",

The undersampling technique described here can be used to significantly shorten scan times, and achieve acquisition durations suitable for in vivo imaging of rodents. Current techniques for voxel-wise comparison of rodent brains include voxel-based morphometry (19) and tensor-based morphometry (20). However, both approaches are more concerned with image geometry rather than the signal levels seen, as a consistent wide-spread approach for quantitative imaging between centers has not appeared to date in the literature. Fully quantitative, 3D acquisitions could be used in this context to obtain standardized multicenter data for analysis of different disease models and treatments.",

The efficiency of our method is limited when compared with the gold standard of human quantitative imaging featuring acceleration with compressed sensing and parallel imaging. The introduction of array coils, as well as more sophisticated anti-aliasing strategies, could be used to further accelerate MRF acquisitions. Using iterative reconstruction such as compressed sensing is a promising strategy for anti-aliasing the images before pattern recognition (5,6). However, the large size of 4D datasets represents a challenge for iterative algorithms, and new strategies are needed to deal with the high computational demand. For instance, new compressed sensing algorithms based on fast, dedicated processing units of high-performance graphics cards (GPUs) developed for cardiac MRI hold promise for reconstruction of large MRF datasets (17). In addition, fast algorithms such as split Bregman could be used to accelerate compressed sensing of large datasets (21), perhaps including spatiotemporal total variation constraints (22).",

In the future, optimized MRF acquisitions could be used to further shorten scan times. In addition, non-Cartesian methods have been demonstrated in the preclinical environment as well as for clinical scanners. Non-Cartesian acquisitions yield better efficiency and antialiasing of undersampled data with respect to Cartesian in several preclinical applications, e.g., Buonincontri et al (23). MR fingerprinting has already been demonstrated using arbitrary gradient waveforms, for instance derived from music to increase patient's comfort (24). Although the use of spiral trajectories has shown great speed benefits for MRF in clinical scanners, we are unaware of implementations of spiral MRF in small-bore MRI scanners. The use of novel 3D non-Cartesian strategies could further accelerate the acquisition bringing 3D, isotropic MRF methods into both preclinical and clinical applications. Direct reductions in scan time can also be achieved by reducing the number of frames (25).",

However, this correction had no impact on the pattern recognition algorithm, as the dictionary size remained unchanged. It took approximately a minute per slice to reconstruct the MRF data here, and this is a reasonable time frame. It is possible to include further parameters in the reconstruction though this is prohibitive as the reconstruction time will scale exponentially with the number of parameters. Reconstruction times and memory occupancy represent the largest current limitation of MRF. New methods to meaningfully compress the dictionary (26) and perform more sophisticated matching (27) are currently being studied. New reconstruction methods could permit the measurement of more parameters simultaneously, such as T2* and diffusion, enhancing the sensitivity of novel MRF techniques.",
