Controlling for worker and job characteristics, it is found that, in the early years of workers' careers in Mexico, wage growth in the informal sector is higher than in the formal sector. This result is consistent with general human capital investment on-the-job if the informal labor market is more competitive than the formal labor market due to frictions generated by labor regulations. (JEL O17, J24, J310) I. INTRODUCTION This study explores the role of informal jobs in the formation of human capital among young less-educated workers. An informal job is a job that fails to comply with some or all of the labor regulations. 1 The set of all informal jobs constitute what is typically known as the informal sector. Due to the lack of compliance with the labor laws, informal jobs are not registered with the authorities. 2 However, it is often argued that compliance with these laws is of great significance in developing countries to ensure social justice for workers (Berg and Kucera 2008) and to protect them against the forces of reallocation in the labor market (Inter-American Development Bank 2003). In spite of these arguments, the lack of compliance with these mandates in developing countries is common practice, leading to the existence of sizable informal labor markets, especially among the youth and the less educated. 3 Hence, the importance of understanding what role the informal sector is playing in the lives of young less-educated workers.",

According to the statistics of the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (published by CEDLAS and The World Bank), the proportion of male workers ages 15-24 years with informal jobs ranges from 30.6% in Chile to 90% in Bolivia (information obtained in September 2012). According to the same source, in Mexico, this proportion is 79%.",

The work of Maloney (1999), Amaral and Quintin (2006), and Galiani and Weinschelbaum (2012) suggests that the existence of informal labor markets is not necessarily evidence of segmentation and that could be an equilibrium outcome in a competitive labor market. However, the work of Arias and Khamis (2008) presents some evidence that is consistent with the rationing of formal-salaried jobs and with segmentation in the labor market. 5 4. Harris and Todaro (1970) were concerned with urban unemployment and explained this in the context of a model of labor markets with segmentation between rural and urban jobs. The full connection with the informal sector is in the model developed by Fields (1975). I would like to thank an anonymous referee from Economic Inquiry for pointing this out to me.",

Maloney (1999) argues that informal-salaried jobs serve as the main point of entry for young poorly educated workers into paid employment. The current study further explores this idea focusing on the group of young less-educated workers in Mexico. The study explores the extent to which less-educated workers in the informal sector experience wage growth and how wage growth in the informal sector compares with wage growth in the formal sector. The basic question is whether informal jobs offer wage growth and skill accumulation to less-educated workers, and how it compares with formal jobs.",

Notice that this low percentage is a result of only including workers with less than 12 years of education in the To determine informal sector status of a worker, I use the labor laws in Mexico. When a worker is hired in Mexico, labor regulations mandate that the employer register the worker in the Mexican Institute of Social Security, IMSS (acronym in Spanish for Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social). This institution provides a bundle of benefits to its affiliates, such as health insurance, day-care services for children, life insurance, disability pensions, work-risk pensions, sports and cultural facilities, retirement pensions, and housing loans (Levy 2007). Both the employer and the worker pay fees to fund this institution, but the employer fees are higher than the worker fees. If a firm is caught not complying with this regulation, it incurs a penalty. Once a worker is registered in the IMSS, the work relationship must abide by the labor regulation in Mexico. 13 The questionnaire of the ENOE does not ask the individual whether he is a formal or an informal worker, but whether his job gives him access to medical services provided by IMSS or other institutions. 14 In this study, I consider a worker to belong to the formal sector if he is a paid employee and his job gives him access to any kind of medical services, and to belong to the informal sector if he is a paid employee and his job does not give him access to medical services. 15 In the remainder of the study, I will focus on male workers with less than 12 years of education and employed as paid employees (salaried). Following the aforementioned definitions of informal and formal sectors, Figure 1(a) presents the proportion of workers employed sample. The proportion of workers who attend high school and went no further among male individuals between ages 16 and 25 years who were paid employees is 26.74%, where 64.09% graduated from high school.

A traditional variance ratio test rejects the hypothesis that the variance of \u0394 1 w in the formal sector is equal to the variance of \u0394 1 w in the informal sector in favor of an alternative that the variance of \u0394 1 w in the formal sector is smaller. 21 However, this test is sensitive to the assumption that the data are drawn from a Normal distribution. Using a test for the equality of variances that is robust when dealing with skewed distributions (Brown and Forsythe 1974;Levene 1960) also rejects the null hypothesis that the variances are equal. 22 Next, I explore how wage growth in the informal sector compares to wage growth in the formal 21. For the variance ratio test, I used the Stata command sdtest. The null hypothesis of this test is that the ratio r = \u03c3 2 FS \u2215\u03c3 2 IS equals 1, i.e. H 0 : r = 1. The calculated test statistic is f = 0.6605, which is distributed as F (32172,27221) , where the degrees of freedom in the numerator and denominator are (n FS \u2212 1) and (n IS \u2212 1), respectively. This null is rejected against the alternative H 1 : r < 1 with a p value of 0.0000, and against the alternative H 1 : r \u2260 1 with a p value of 0.0000, but cannot be rejected against the alternative H 1 : r > 1 with a p value of 1.0000.",

To compute wage growth \u0394 k w it two periods are involved, an initial period (t \u2212 k) and a final period t. The industry and firm size indicators are those of period t, which is the final period used to compute the wage growth. different sizes, or operating in different industries, are systematically different with respect to productivity, then these differences in productivity may lead to differences in wage growth as well as wage levels. For instance, larger firms invest more in technology than small firms, which may require more worker training, in turn resulting in higher wage growth. Similarly, one could argue that firms in industries with higher opportunities for human capital accumulation for young less-educated workers will experience on average faster wage growth than other industries. 25 Recall that formal sector workers are mostly employed in large firms, whereas informal sector workers are mostly employed in small firms (see Table 1). Similarly, the fraction of workers employed in the manufacturing and commerce industries is higher among formal sector workers, whereas the fraction of workers employed in the construction and services industries is higher among informal sector workers (see Table 1). Then, however, not including firm-size controls would result in a downward-biased estimate of \u03b2 k because wage growth is faster in larger firms and working in a large firm is negatively correlated with being informal salaried worker. However, not including industry controls would result in an upward-biased estimate of \u03b2 k because workers in the construction industry experience faster wage growth than those in other industries, and working in the construction industry is positively correlated with being informal salaried worker. The opposite directions of the biases are reflected in the estimates of Table 3 that are larger than the estimates in Table 2 but the differences are not large and the conclusion is the same.",

However, if unobserved heterogeneity, or \"ability,\" has a similar effect on wage levels in two or three consecutive quarters, then its effect should cancel out when looking at wage growth. 26 Also, recall that educational achievement does not have a significant effect on wage growth (as indicated by the estimates in Table 3), and so it appears unlikely that unobserved heterogeneity would have a crucial role, given the strong correlation between education and ability. With respect to worker selection, one can argue that those workers continuously employed in the informal sector are negatively selected, and so, if high-ability workers experience faster wage growth than low-ability workers, the estimate of the coefficient of IS k it would be downward-biased. If this is the case, then we can consider the estimate of \u03b2 k provided in this study as a lower bound for the true value, and so the conclusion 26. Suppose that log-wages are given by: ln w it = z \u2032 it \u03b4 + \u03bc i + \u03b5 it where z it is a vector of individual and firm observed characteristics, \u03bc i represents a worker's unobserved ability, and \u03b5 it is a well-behaved error term.

            "text": "It is important to note that by looking at wage growth, nonrandom sample attrition in the panel may grow for longer spans. Based on the results from Table 3, this could represent a problem if most of the attriters are individuals employed in the informal sector with low wage growth or employed in the formal sector with high wage growth. Antman and McKenzie (2007) and Duval-Hern\u00e1ndez (2007) highlight the problem of attrition in the ENEU (Encuesta Nacional de Empleo Urbano), which is the predecessor of the ENOE and had the same sampling structure. Antman and McKenzie (2007) find that for the period 1987-2001, 10% of the households in the ENEU were observed for only one quarter, and approximately 65% of the households could be followed for all five quarters. Similarly, Duval-Hern\u00e1ndez (2007) finds that for the period 1987-2002, 50% of the sample of interest in the ENEU was missing from the panel, most of them due to attrition. Hence, the concern is that the ENOE may also suffer from attrition. Table 4 presents the pattern of attrition in the ENOE during the period of 2005-2012. 27 As Table 4 indicates, the problem of attrition appears less serious in the ENOE compared to the ENEU. For example, the attrition rate after the first interview is only 1.13%, and some of these individuals may come back from nonresponse at later interviews. The attrition rate is higher between the third and fourth interviews, but by the fifth interview 84.19% of the individuals who started are still in the sample. Next, Table 5 27. Tables 3 and 4 are motivated by the work of Fitzgerald et al. (1998). presents the characteristics in the first interview by attrition status. There are some small but clear differences between those who were always in the sample and those who ever came out, almost all of these differences are statistically significant. For example, those who were always in the sample have less hours of work, lower hourly earnings, and are older than those who were ever out. Equally important for this study are the differences in the distribution by industry of occupation and firm size. Overall, the numbers in Table 5 suggest that sample attrition could  bias the regression results presented in Table 3.",

The test consists in building a variable that summarizes the pattern of attrition, adding this variable to the regression being estimated and testing for its significance. Following the implementation of this test by Jones et al. (2013), I construct three variables: (1) an indicator of whether the individual is in the next interview, 28 (2) an indicator of whether the individual is in the balanced panel, and (3) a variable measuring the number of interviews each individual is in the sample. Intuitively, if attrition is random, then conditional on the covariates, none of these variables should be correlated with the outcome variable, that is, with \u0394 k w it for k = 1, 2, 3. Note that I cannot perform this test on the four-quarter wage growth regression, \u0394 k w it for k = 4, because the variable for consecutive informal sector participation IS 4 it equals one if the individual is informal salaried for all five interviews and zero if he is formal salaried for all five interviews. Hence, for all observations with IS 4 it = 1 or IS 4 it = 0 the three additional variables have no variance at all.",

If older workers employed in the informal sector also experience faster wage growth than similar workers employed in similar jobs in the formal sector, then one can argue that workers would never want to leave their informal sector jobs, and that the formal sector would eventually disappear. On the contrary, the data suggest that for the group of young less educated workers, the number of workers (and the proportion of workers) employed in the formal sector increases with age (see Figure 1).",

In this model, the wage is determined by the worker's productivity in the current firm but also by the productivity in other firms. A distinctive feature of a competitive labor market is that productivity increases with general training equally in the firm providing it as well as in other firms. Consequently, firms cannot capture any of the returns from the investment in general training because the worker can move freely to another firm once training is finished. As a result, in a competitive labor market, workers capture all the returns from investment in general skills and bear the cost of general training through lower wages. Which implies a substantial wage growth after training is over. Acemoglu and Pischke (1999b) argue that because of labor market imperfections, worker's productivity in the current firm increases more with training than in other firms. Hence, when workers change jobs, they do not get paid their full marginal product, and as a result productivity increases faster with training than wages. Consequently, firms' profits increase with training, and for this reason firms are willing to sponsor general training. As a result, wage growth after training is over is not as substantial as in the case in which the workers bear all the costs of training. Acemoglu and Pischke also provide mechanisms 29. General training increases a worker's productivity at any firm, contrary to firm-specific training, which increases productivity more in firms providing it. See Becker (1993), chapter III. that produce this distorted structure of wages as an equilibrium outcome of the model. Two of these mechanisms are: job-search frictions, and labor market institutions, such as minimum wages and unions. Furthermore, Acemoglu and Pischke show that the higher the distortion on the wage structure due to the labor market frictions, the more the firm will sponsor general training.",

            "text": "The models of Becker (1993) and Acemoglu and Pischke (1999b) can be used together with the institutional differences that exist between the formal and the informal labor markets to interpret the evidence from wage data presented in the previous section. The features of the informal and the formal labor markets suggest that the informal labor market operates like a competitive labor market whereas the formal labor market operates like a frictional labor market. First, the informal labor market is not directly affected by labor market institutions, whereas, by definition, the formal labor market is affected by these institutions. Second, job search frictions are likely to be higher in the formal labor market than in the informal labor market. A market friction is defined as \"the costly delay in the process of finding trading partners and determining the terms of trade \u2026 \" (see Mortensen andPissarides 1999, 2571). The institutional features of the formal labor market, such as unions or hiring and firing costs, generate frictions that delay the process of job matching. Because the informal labor market, by definition, is not subject to these institutional features, job matching in the informal sector, while not perfect, is less complicated than in the formal sector. According to the model of Acemoglu and Pischke (1999b), frictions in the labor market allow firms to reap some of the returns from general training which leads firms to pay at least part for the costs of training. And so, if the formal labor market is a frictional labor market, firms in the formal sector will pay at least part of the costs of training, so that wages are not heavily discounted during the training period. However, according to the model of Becker (1993), in a competitive labor market, workers reap the returns from training but also bear the costs of training. And so, if the informal labor market is a competitive labor market, wages are discounted more heavily during the training period. As a consequence, even if both sectors have the same amount of investment on training, wage growth in the informal sector should be faster than wage growth in the formal sector. Which is the result found in the previous section? 30 The notion that the informal labor market is competitive while the formal labor market is frictional has been used in previous studies. For example, Zenou (2008) develops an equilibrium model of the informal and formal sectors to evaluate various policies to reduce unemployment. In Zenou's model, the formal labor market is characterized by search frictions, whereas the informal labor market is competitive. Equally important is the fact that labor market institutions generate frictions, and that labor market institutions are directly related with the existence and the level of informality in the labor market. In fact, one of the most cited causes of large informal sectors is the existence of rigidities in the labor market due to excessive regulation (see Schneider and Enste 2000). This link between labor regulations and the existence of informal sectors has been studied and documented. For example, Rauch (1991) develops a model in which the size of the informal sector is directly related to the degree of labor regulation. 31  Bosch et al. (2007) find 30. It is natural to ask if 3-12 months (one-to fourquarters) are enough for a worker to accumulate the skills necessary for work. Employers' reports in the surveys for the Employer Opportunity Pilot Projects (EOPP) for year 1982, and the survey funded by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for 1992, suggest that the unconditional mean length of time for a worker \"to become fully trained and qualified\" is about 21 weeks, and that the median is about 6 weeks (see Barron et al. 1997, Table 3.4).",

Figure 2 shows that, on average, wages in the informal sector are lower than in the formal sector. The difference in intercepts in the log-wage regressions presented in Appendix B suggests that there is still a gap after controlling for worker and firm observable characteristics. Finally, Figure 1 suggests that, during the first years of the workers' careers, workers are more likely to move from the informal to the formal sector as they age. If wages and productivity are lower in the informal sector and informal sector workers expect to move to the formal sector eventually, investment in human capital may be greater in the informal sector than in the formal sector. That is, if workers face a lower price for their skills in the informal sector in the present, and expect a higher price for their skills when they move to the formal sector in the future, then the opportunity cost of human capital investment is lower in the informal sector, which will induce informal sector workers to invest more in human capital. Formal sector workers, however, do not face this lower opportunity cost.",

In the study by Becker (1993), when firms provide firm-specific on-the-job training, firms bear the cost of training because if the worker moves to another firm, all productivity gains from training will be lost. If most of the training in the formal sector involves firm-specific human capital, whereas most of the training in the informal sector involves general human capital, wages in the informal sector will exhibit greater growth than wages in the formal sector.",

This is also consistent with theories of human capital accumulation, because it is mostly young workers who invest in accumulating skills on the job (e.g., Ben-Porath 1967;Rosen 1972). If most training takes place during the early stages of workers' careers, and if informal sector workers invest in human capital just as formal sector workers, or perhaps more, then we should only observe faster wage growth in the informal sector during the early stages of the workers' careers. This is what the evidence presented in Table 8 suggests.",

Two alternative explanations are wage flexibility and job switching. It is possible that the results in Table 3 just reflect the fact that wages are more flexible in the informal sector than in the formal sector, particularly since previous studies have found that it is common that nominal wages remain constant from year to year in IMSS-registered firms (Castellanos et al. 2004). However, the results presented in Table 8 indicate that change in wages is not consistent across age groups, which does not support the wage flexibility explanation. That is, if the finding that wage growth is faster in the informal sector due to wage rigidity in IMSS-registered firms, this should be true for older workers too. Table 8 indicates that while this is true for one-quarter wage growth, it is not true for two-, three-, and four-quarter wage growth. Hence, the results in Table 8 discard this possibility.",

However, the range of hourly wage changes in Figure 2 is very large for both informal and formal sector wages, and for both wage increases and wage decreases.

Changes in these characteristics are considered separately for the four different time spans: one-, two-, three-, and four-quarters. The table also shows, in parenthesis, the proportion of individual changes relative to the total number of observations by sector, presented in the first row. Recall that there can be multiple wage growth observations by individuals, and so there can also be multiple changes by individuals for each of the three categories. The results are mixed: there is a larger proportion of workers switching job position and firm size within the formal sector, but there is a larger proportion of workers switching industry within the informal sector. The last two rows present the number of changes in \"at least one\" category without double counting switchers and, in parenthesis, the proportion of these changes relative to the total number of observations in each sector. That is, if a worker changes both occupation and industry this is only counted as one change. In this case, the numbers show that the proportion of changes in the formal sector is larger than in the informal sector.

The estimation results indicate that graduation from primary school is an important factor to explain differences in earnings in the informal sector, but not in the formal sector. The effect of middle school graduation, however, is an important factor to explain differences in earnings in both sectors as well as labor market experience. Note that the indicators for the minimum wage zones are only significant in the formal sector. On average, those workers employed in cities with the highest minimum wage have higher earnings than those employed in cities in the minimum wage zones B and C.",
