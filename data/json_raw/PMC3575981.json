            "text": "Purpose: Hemophilia A (HA) is the most common X-linked inherited bleeding disorder. In some patients with HA, particularly those with severe HA, replacement therapy results in the production of high-responding clotting factor VIII inhibitors. The economic burden of this complication is the highest reported for a chronic disease. Our aim was to investigate the direct medical expenditure burden of high-responding inhibitors in patients with HA. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Research Database, utilizing data covering the period of 2004-2007. Results: In total, 638 males with HA\u00b8 including 37 patients with high-responding inhibitors were evaluated. Over 99% of the annual median medical expenditure was attributable to the cost of clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) in patients with high-responding inhibitors. The annual median expenditure related to CFCs of the total medical care and outpatient care were US$170611 and US$141982, respectively, and were 4.6-and 4.3-fold higher in these patients during the study period, respectively. In patients with high-responding inhibitors, the median hospitalization expenditure and daily hospitalization cost with or without surgical procedures were 3.0-and 2.4-fold higher, respectively, and 4.3 and 5.6-fold higher, respectively. Conclusion: Our data reveal higher medical expenditures burden for patients with HA and high-responding inhibitors in Taiwan. Future research is encouraged to evaluate the impact of this burden on patient quality of life.",

            "text": "Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by the functional absence or reduced levels of clotting factor VIII (FVIII). The disease is classified as mild, moderate, or severe, based on the degree of deficiency of the coagulation factor. 1 The introduction of replacement therapy due to the availability of exogenous FVIII concentrates has substantially reduced bleeding episodes, pre-nosis-related groups, and a resource-based relative value scale system. 14 Prior to implementation of the NHI program, individuals with hemophilia received only fewer amount clotting factors to relieve disease progression. Hemophilia has been classified as a catastrophic illness by the NHI since the program was implemented, exempting patients from a co-payment and assuring that patients are able to obtain sufficient CFCs for suitable replacement therapy. Thereafter, the BNHI implemented a global budget, and an independent budget (including hemophilia) has been allocated for rare diseases since 2004. However, no studies have been published regarding the economic burden of patients with high-responding inhibitors in Taiwan.",

In patients with transient or low-responding inhibitors or low actual inhibitor titers (<5 BU mL -1 ) and who have weaker inhibitor responses to factor concentrates, bleeding episodes are commonly managed by increasing the vented musculoskeletal damage, and improved orthopedic outcomes and quality of life in patients with hemophilia. 2 Following the recommended prophylactic treatment, home therapy, and comprehensive care enables patients with HA to enjoy a better general state of health and engage in daily activities, social events, work, and education. [3][4][5] However, in some patients with HA, therapeutically administered exogenous FVIII concentrates are recognized as foreign particulates, resulting in the production of antibodies (inhibitors) that neutralize the activity of FVIII and reduce or eliminate the efficacy of factor replacement therapy. Inhibitors are produced in 20-30% of patients with severe HA, but they may also arise in patients with mild/moderate HA and at any time in the patient's life. 6,7 Patients with high-titer inhibitory antibodies can develop serious bleeding complications, resulting in greater rates of disability and risks of complications, and in these patients, so-called bypassing agents, such as recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa) and activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs), are needed to achieve hemostasis. 8 The economic consequences of treating hemophilia are mainly related to the direct medical costs of replacement clotting factor concentrates (CFCs), and economic burden of inhibitor complication in patients with hemophilia is one of the highest reported for a chronic disease. [9][10][11][12] In March 1995, Taiwan launched a mandatory National Health Insurance (NHI) program that integrated three existing health insurance programs: labor, government employee, and farmer's insurance. By the end of 2004, approximately 99% of the population was covered, and nearly 23 million beneficiaries are currently enrolled in the NHI. 13 The NHI is a single-payer compulsory social health insurance program organized by the government and operated by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI). The system is primarily funded by premiums paid collectively by the insured, employers, and central and local governments. The NHI program allows patients the freedom of choice when seeking medical care and uses cost-sharing strategies to reduce the potential demand for unnecessary services. In the initial stage, fee-for-service was widespread for both public and private providers. Facing spiraling growth of medical costs and demands to keep healthcare costs under control without a decline in the quality of care, the payment system for the NHI changed from fee-for-service to a global budget in 2002. To better manage the medical expenditures and enhance the professional autonomy of medical providers, other payment methods have been introduced in recent years, such as pay-for-performance, diag-deficiency virus infection. The disease-related hospitalization complication analyses were classified as with or without surgical procedures. The complications with surgical procedures primarily included joint replacement, synovectomy, insertion of a totally implantable vascular access device, incision with the removal of a foreign body from the skin and subcutaneous tissue, tooth extraction, and other procedures. The costs were calculated using a 3% discount rate and adjusted by using the Taiwan Consumer Price Index of medicines and medical care category and expressed in 2007 US dollars. 15,16 ",

Fig. 2 shows the annual proportion of CFCs costs in all patients with high-responding inhibitors. The bypassing agents increased over time from 76.6% in 2004 to 85.2% in 2007, and year-to-year variation was evident. Moreover, the proportion of expenditures related to rFVII tended to decrease, whereas those related to aPCCs tended to increase. Table 4 shows the disease-related complications of hospitalization. Approximately 49.8% of hospitalizations were   to factor replacement in patients with high-responding inhibitors were 3-fold higher than in those in patients without inhibitors after the entry of bypassing agents; previous studies reported lower values, but these studies also had relatively small sample sizes and issues regarding outliers (the mean/median issue).

The results revealed an apparently higher medical resources burden for the care of these patients. The annual total median cost related to CFCs was 4.6 times higher in patients with high-responding inhibitors, confirming the findings by Goudemand 18 that costs related  more severe degrees of arthropathy and greater difficulties with mobility and daily activities than patients without inhibitors. 24,25 Gringeri, et al. 11 reported that quality of life and joint scores were significantly improved by the allocation of large amounts of resources to patients with high-responding inhibitors in Italy. In particular, the physical quality of life in these patients was similar to that in patients with severe chronic diseases such as diabetes and dialysis-dependent chronic renal failure, whereas their mental quality of life was comparable to that of the general population. Approximately 4.6% (37/803) of patients with high-responding inhibitors consume approximately 20% of NHI's CFC-related resources annually, suggesting that continued optimization of strategic planning and management with the care network is needed to improve patient quality of care and quality of life. Future studies are encouraged in Taiwan to include the impact on quality of life excluding economic consequences.",

            "text": "The use of the Taiwanese NHI dataset provides the first major evidence of economic burden among an Asian population of patients with high-responding inhibitors. The mandatory NHI program insures >99% of the Taiwanese population, with all geographic regions and populations represented. However, some limitations in the present study should be mentioned. First, we identified patients with high-responding inhibitors via an inhibitor assay and according to the use of rFVIIa and aPCCs in the study. Unfortunately, this methodology may have missed some patients with high-responding inhibitors, particularly children who were treated only with ITI therapy after diagnosis, which usually involves the daily infusion of large doses of FVIII over many months or years. Consequently, the proportion of patients with high-responding inhibitors may have been underestimated. Second, as patients with severe hemophilia patients have been demonstrated to use more CFCs than those with mild and moderate hemophilia, patients with high-responding inhibitors, who generally have severe disease, can potentially account for the increased cost of CFC. Further assessment of the comparing with patients characterized was severe hemophilia in non high-responding inhibitors (412/601, 68.5%). The annual median expenditure related to total medical care and total CFCs costs showed a reduction to 3.0-amd 2.9-fold higher among patients with high-responding inhibitors, respectively. Therefore, it is unlikely that it would materially affect the high economic burden results of our study. Third, CFCs, comprising the most costly component of hemophilia treatment, are administered on the basis of weight. Un-tion costs depend primarily on the inhibitor status of the patient. The median daily hospitalization costs in patients who did or did not undergo surgical procedures were 2.4-and 5.6-fold higher, respectively, in patients with high-responding inhibitors. Gautier, et al. 22 reported that the daily cost was 2-5-fold higher in French patients with HA and highresponding inhibitors during hospitalization. Costs related to bypassing agents accounted for more than 90% of the total inpatient costs related to CFCs among patients with highresponding inhibitors. The difference in hospitalization costs may be closely related to the duration of hospitalization and, to a lesser extent, to the possible reason for bypassing agent administration.",

The NHI has reimbursement criteria for the clinical management of inhibitory antibodies in patients, although on-demand treatment is most common. However, CFC replacement therapy and drug utilization patterns are critically influenced by multiple variables, such as clinical circumstances, patient profiles, individual responses, dose regimen protocol, reimbursement policy, and healthcare service type. Other cost-contributing concerns include the use of immune tolerance induction (ITI) for inhibitor eradication and/or prophylaxis to decrease the frequency of bleeding episodes. Owing to the wide clinical variability and responsiveness to current therapeutic approaches and the scarcity of studies providing high-level evidence for therapeutic guidelines at the present time, 11,23 we believe that current strategies for managing these patients are rather heterogeneous, and in our clinical experience, patients do not respond equally well to the various types of bypassing agents in Taiwan.
