This study was aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine at reduced intradermal and full intramuscular dose. Materials and Methods: We compared the effect of one-fifth and one-half intradermal doses to the full intramuscular dose on immunogenicity in healthy young adults, using a commercial influenza vaccine. A hemagglutination inhibition assay was used to compare the immunogenicity of the vaccination methods. Results: The one-fifth intradermal dose (3 \u00b5g hemagglutinin antigen, HA) was given to 30 participants, the one-half intradermal dose (7.5 \u00b5g HA) was given to 30, and the full intramuscular dose (15 \u00b5g HA) was given to 32. No significant differences among injection routes and dosages were seen for seroprotection rate, seroconversion rate, or geometric mean titer (GMT) fold-increase for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B at around 4 weeks from vaccination. Although GMT for influenza B was significantly lower at six months for the one-fifth intradermal vaccination compared to the full-dose intramuscular vaccination (32.8 vs. 63.2, p=0.048), all three groups met the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMA) immunogenicity criteria through 1 to 6 months. Conclusion: Intradermal administration of a one-fifth dose of influenza vaccine elicited antibody responses comparable to the intradermal one-half dose and a conventional intramuscular vaccination at 1 month post-vaccination. The immunogenicity of the one-fifth intradermal dose was sufficient to meet the requirement for the EMA criteria at six months after influenza vaccination.",

            "text": "Influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases, with global epidemics occurring every 10-40 years. Although relatively benign, influenza can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality; influenza-related complications include pneumonia, encephalitis, myocarditis, and gradual deterioration of organ functions. Annual vaccination is the primary measure for preventing influenza-related morbidity and mortality, but the vaccine supply can be limited in an early pandemic situation. To prepare for potential vaccine shortages under an influenza pandemic, several antigensparing strategies have been investigated. These include adjuvanted vaccines and new Intradermal influenza vaccination requires less antigen to be as effective as regular intramuscular vaccination. The improved immune response is due to the higher level of dendritic cells in the dermis than in the muscle [1][2][3]. Furthermore, the dermis has a rich supply of blood and lymphatic vessels that aids circulation of immune cells [4,5].",

            "text": "This study showed that the immunogenicity of one-fifth and one-half doses of intradermal seasonal influenza vaccine were largely comparable to full-dose intramuscular vaccination in healthy young adults. All three groups satisfied the EMA immunogenicity criteria for influenza vaccines, although the intradermal one-fifth dose vaccination elicited lower antibody responses than the intradermal one-half dose and the conventional dose of an intramuscular vaccination. Intramuscular vaccination bypasses the skin's immune system, while intradermal vaccination targets dense populations of dendritic cells in the skin. Skin is considered a desirable target for vaccination; about 25% of the skin is covered by dendritic cells, which are postulated to acquire antigens in peripheral tissue by priming naive T cells [1][2][3]. Moreover, antigen is suggested to become trapped in the cutaneous tissue for long periods after intradermal injection, compared to in-tramuscular injection [10]. Several trials of intradermal influenza vaccines have studied the characteristic features of the dermal immune system in adults of diverse ages [11,12]. A recent literature review [11] found 10 trials using reduced-dose intradermal influenza vaccines ranging from 3 to 9 \u00b5g HA per strain. Among these trials, five used a 3-\u00b5g dose [2,[13][14][15][16]. Of the 10 trials, 8 found comparable responses between intradermal influenza vaccines at a reduced dose and a full-dose intramuscular vaccine [2,13,[15][16][17][18][19][20]. One trial showed that a dose-sparing intradermal vaccine was superior to a conventional-dose intramuscular vaccine [21]. Thus, intradermal influenza vaccines at a reduced dose can be immunogenic in a way that is comparable to a full-dose intramuscular vaccine. However, data on antibody persistence has been insufficient. In this study, we showed that even a one-fifth dose of an intradermal vaccine induced antibody responses that persisted for six months.",
