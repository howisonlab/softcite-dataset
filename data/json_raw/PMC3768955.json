A sequential statistical methodology comprising of Plackett-Burman and response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to enhance the fermentative production of chitinase, in which inulin was firstly used as an effective carbon source. As a result, maximum chitinase activity of 5.17 U/mL was obtained in the optimized medium, which was 15.5-fold higher than that in the basal medium. The triplicate verification experiments were performed under the optimized nutrients levels which indicated that it well agreed with the predicted value.",

Plackett-Burman (P-B) and response-surface methodology (RSM) are multivariate analyzing tools comprising of mathematical and statistical techniques for generating empirical models that obtained importance for optimizing production conditions of industrially high value products such as chemicals, enzymes, and for studying enzyme kinetics. The statistical tool has been used in many biotechnological processes namely optimization of culture conditions (19), enzyme production (32), ethanol production (10), and biomass production (36). It was also useful for optimizing the yield of recombinant products such as actinorhodin (9), nisin (21), lysozyme (14), alkaline protease",

The observed chitinase activity (the response) versus those factors from the empirical model equation 2 was shown in Figure 1, which indicated that the predicted data of the response from the empirical model was in agreement with the observed ones in the range of the operating variables. The graphical representation provides a method to visualize the relationship between the response and experimental levels of each variable and the type of interactions between test variables to deduce the optimum conditions. In this design, the response surface curves for the four variables were shown in Figure 2. The response surface representing chitinase was a function of concentrations of the two medium components with another nutrient being at a zero level. The regression equation, maximized by the Design Expert 7.0 (Minneapolis, USA) software, allowed to obtain the following optimal coded units for test variables: X 1 = 0.1, X 2 = 0.55, X 3 = 0.80 and X 4 = 1.00, which corresponded to optimal concentrations of (g/L) 3.10 urea, 3.55 inulin, 3.80 chitin and 0.64 sodium sulfate, for the maximal chitinase activity of the 5.17 U/mL, predicted by the mathematical model with a high model accuracy. The P values are used for checking the significance of each coefficient which, in turn, it is necessary to understand the pattern of the mutual interactions between the important variables, and the small magnitude of P values means that the corresponding coefficients are more significant.

Initially, chitinase yield was very low, and after a lag phase of near 48 hours, chitinase yield gradually increased. After about 84 hours of incubation, chitinase reached the maximum yield. The time course showed that the optimized fermentation conditions change the chitinase producing process. After the enzyme activity reached maximum, the production of chitinase reduced rapidly, which was similar to the previous reports (26, 33).

Chitinases hydrolyze chitin is the future direction of research. So far chitinase can be found everywhere in a variety of microorganisms, nevertheless the production level is far from being enough for commercialization. For that reason, isolating novel chitinaseproducing microorganisms and production optimization for high productivity are of great importance to the industry. A strain with strong chitinolytic activity was isolated in our laboratory from the soil samples named Chitinolyticbacter meiyuanensis SYBC-H1 which is gen. nov., sp. nov. The traditional one factor at a time process requires a complete Chitanase production from C. meiyuanensis series of experiments for important factors of interest, which is laborious and time consuming. Furthermore, such methods could not provide information for the interactions of the factors. Statistical methodology could locate the most important factors levels with minimum effort and time; moreover, it could reveal the interaction among the factor. In this study, a sequential statistical methodology comprising of Plackett-Burman and response surface methodology were applied to enhance the fermentative production of chitinase.

Their suitable concentrations ranges were preliminarily determined. Table 4 shows various combinations used and the corresponding chitinase yield. Data were analyzed by linear multiple regression using the Design-Expert (Version 7.0; Stat-Ease, Inc.) and the following equation was obtained.Y=4.68+0.34X1+0.25X2+0.52X3+0.16X4+0.041X1X2+0.025X1X3-0.19X1X4 -0.11X2X3+0.19 X2X4+0.39X3X4-0.95X1 2 -0.32 X2 2 -0.53 X3 2 -0.16 X4 2 (3)shake-flask cultures.

The R 2 coefficient obtained, of 0.8422, suggests that it is a reliable model and that 84.22% of the sample variation of chitinase yield is attributed to a high correlation between the independent variables. Only 15.78% of the total variation of chitinase production was not explained by the model.",
