The fungal isolate was named KNU-3 and was found to exhibit plant growth-promoting (PGP) activity through indole acetic acid (IAA) and siderophore production, as well as P solubilization. KNU-3 produced 9.7 mg/L IAA and solubilized 408 mg of Ca 3 PO 4 /L, and inoculation with the isolate significantly (p < 0.05) increased the dry biomass of cucumber roots (57%) and shoots (52%). Chlorophyll, starch, protein, and P contents were increased by 16%, 45%, 22%, and 14%, respectively, compared to plants grown in uninoculated soil. The fungus also increased soil dehydrogenase (30%) and acid phosphatase (19%) activities. These results demonstrate that the isolate KNU-3 has potential PGP attributes, and therefore it can be considered as a new fungus to enhance soil fertility and promote plant growth. Moreover, the discovery of PGP ability and traits of this fungus will open new aspects of research and investigations. In this study, plant growth promotion by P. menonorum KNU-3 is reported for the first time in Korea after its original description.",

            "text": "The growing world population and the increasing demand for crop production have led to excessive use of pesticides and inorganic fertilizers worldwide. The application of chemical fertilizers causes an increase in crop yield, but large quantities of these chemicals are deposited in the soil, thereby posing a potential health hazard and affecting the microbial soil population. Furthermore, the fertilizers are highly costly and therefore are associated with an increased cost of production. Current trends in agriculture are focused on the reduction of the use of inorganic fertilizers, and the use of plant growth-promoting (PGP) microorganisms for alternative ways to improve a more sustainable agriculture [1,2]. PGP inoculants have been employed as biofertilizers, as supplements to chemical fertilizers, in the production of field, vegetable, and forage crops [2,3]. Among the PGP microorganisms, fungi are important components of the soil microbiota and typically constitute more of the soil biomass than bacteria [4].",

Penicillium species are widely distributed in nature across diverse soil environments such as cultivated soil, forest soil, desert soil, beach soil, and marine habitats [5,6]. Penicillium species have received significant attention in the production of bioactive compounds, including mycotoxins, antibiotics, herbicides, antioxidants, insecticides, and anticancer compounds [7], as well as extracellular enzymes and crops [8]. Recent studies have reported that some species of Penicillium promote plant growth by one of several different mechanisms, such as the production of PGP phytohormones (gibberellins, auxin, cytokinin, and siderophores), solubilization of minerals, and antagonism to phytopathogens [9][10][11]. Previous studies have revealed that inoculation of soil with PGP Penicillium species significantly promotes the growth, P uptake, and yield of several important crops, including wheat [9], sesame [11], and pomegranate [3].",

Three seeds were sown (3.0 cm deep) in each pot with or without 10 g of fungus inoculum (10-mL fungus suspension mixed with 10 g autoclaved commercial soil). The fungus inoculum was applied near the seeds during seeding. Treatments were replicated 12 times in a completely randomized block design. After 1 wk, the seedlings were thinned to two per pot. Seedlings were grown in an open environment, using tap water to maintain 70% of soil water-holding capacity. After 4 wk, plants were removed from the pots; roots and shoots were separated, and repeatedly washed in deionized water. The leaf chlorophyll content was measured using a SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolata, Tokyo, Japan). The total soluble protein content in the leaf was estimated according to the Bradford method [22] and starch was estimated by using phenol sulfuric acid reagent [23]. Shoot and root dry weights were measured after oven  [24]. Soil available P [25] and the acid phosphatase [26] and dehydrogenase [27] enzyme activities were estimated.",

Peterson sp. nov (GenBank accession No. HQ646591). The phylogenetic analysis of KNU-3 was carried out by distance tree construction. The ITS1 sequence of KNU-3 was aligned with sequences of available P. menonorum strains and its nearest species through the BLAST sequence using MultAlin program, and a neighbor-joining tree was constructed from the aligned sequences. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate was grouped with a reference isolate of P. menonorum with 99% bootstrap value support (Fig. 2), and was distinct from other Penicillium spp., which were grouped in distinct clades. These results indicate that the isolate KNU-3 is closely related to P. menonorum. Based on morphological properties, sequence homology, and phylogenetic analysis, the isolate KNU-3 was thus identified as P. menonorum. PGP traits. P. menonorum KNU-3 was able to produce siderophores in the plate-based assay as evidenced by the formation of a yellow zone on the CAS agar medium plate ( Supplementary Fig. 1A). While the fungal isolate produced a significant amount of IAA (9.7 mg/L), no ACC deaminase activity was detected. As shown in Table 1, P-solubilization increased from day 2 to day 6 with a value ranging from 198 to 408 mg/L ( Supplementary Fig. 1B).

After 5 days of incubation, soluble P decreased slowly with a concomitant slight pH increase of the medium (Table 1).",

            "text": "Numerous microfungi were isolated in the present study to investigate the fungal community in Jeongseon, Gangwondo, Korea. Among these isolates, one Penicillium sp. showed definitive similarity matches with P. menonorum. In order to confirm the morphological results, molecular identification of the isolate was carried out based on ITS sequence analysis. The ITS sequence of the isolate was compared to the GenBank database sequences by using the NCBI-BLAST search program, and it was found to be identical to the type strain NRRL: 50410 of P. menonorum S.W. Peterson sp. nov. In addition, the phylogenetic tree revealed that the isolate was grouped in a distinct clade together with P. menonorum with bootstrap support value of 100% (Fig. 2). Morphological and molecular characteristics of the isolate were in agreement with the description by Peterson et al. [15]. P. menonorum S.W. Peterson sp. nov. is a phenotypically and genotypically broadly circumscribed new species that was first isolated from garden soil in southern California by Peterson et al. [15], and P. menonorum isolation from Panax ginseng has been reported in China [28]. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this study presents the first record of P. menonorum in Korea. Many microbial-based agricultural techniques have been developed to exploit potential mechanisms for the enhancement of crop production in different soils. Although members of the genus Penicillium are common opportunistic pathogens in the soil environment, some Penicillium strains associated with the different plant rhizospheres are able to solubilize inorganic insoluble P salts and promote plant growth in the soil. Thus, the growth-promoting capacity of P. menonorum KNU-3 was evaluated by assaying for IAA and siderophore production, ACC deaminase activity, and P solubilization. IAA secreted by microorganisms promotes root growth through a direct stimulatory effect on plant cell elongation or cell division [29]. In the present study, P. menonorum KNU-3 was positive for both IAA and siderophore production. Other researchers have made similar observations for the IAA production by Penicillium sp. [11]. Siderophores are important metabolites released by the PGP microorganisms that directly alleviate iron  deficiency by increasing the supply of iron to the plant and indirectly depriving fungal pathogens of iron [30,31]. Kang et al. [32] reported that siderophores are also able to chelate Mg 2+ , Ca",

Thus, the efficiency of P. menonorum for its phosphate-solubilizing activity was quantitatively estimated at different time intervals in liquid medium during the in vitro study. The level of P availability in the culture filtrate was significantly increased by decreasing the pH of the medium up to the 5th day (Fig. 2). However, a significant drop in soluble P levels was observed on later days (Fig. 2). This could be due to the depletion of nutrients in the culture medium [32], limiting the availability of the soluble form of P, which has an inhibitory effect on further P solubilization [33]. In addition, the formation of an organo-phosphate compound induced by the release of organic metabolites might have reduced the amount of available P [34]. In this study, phosphate solubilization was accompanied by a decrease in the pH of the medium. The results of this study are in agreement with other studies on the effect of pH on the solubilization of the P source.",

Periodic estimation of available P in the medium revealed the potential of the isolate to release P from insoluble phosphate sources from agricultural soil. In addition to P solubilization, KNU-3 also produced other secondary metabolites such as IAA and siderophores.

Because P in soil is likely to be fixed, it is usually present in trace amounts and is relatively unavailable to plants. The increase in P uptake by cucumber plants and higher concentrations of available P in soil reported in this study might be due to solubilization of insoluble P present in the soil by phosphate-solubilizing P. menonorum, thereby enhancing the P uptake. It has been reported that Psolubilizing Penicillium spp. are capable of solubilizing the unavailable forms of P in P-bearing minerals in soil through the production and excretion of organic acids, phosphatase, and phytase enzymes [3,40].",
