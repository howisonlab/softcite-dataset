Materials and Methods: Seventy-two study participants with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were enrolled by four U.S. clinical sites. A sensor was inserted on the back of each upper arm for up to 14 days. Three factory-only calibrated sensor lots were used in the study. Sensor glucose measurements were compared with capillary blood glucose (BG) results (approximately eight per day) obtained using the BG meter built into the reader (BG reference) and with the YSI analyzer (Yellow Springs Instrument, Yellow Springs, OH) reference tests at three clinic visits (32 samples per visit). Sensor readings were masked to the participants. Results: The accuracy of the results was demonstrated against capillary BG reference values, with 86.7% of sensor results within Consensus Error Grid Zone A. The percentage of readings within Consensus Error Grid Zone A on Days 2, 7, and 14 was 88.4%, 89.2%, and 85.2%, respectively. The overall mean absolute relative difference was 11.4%. The mean lag time between sensor and YSI reference values was 4.5-4.8 min. Sensor accuracy was not affected by factors such as body mass index, age, type of diabetes, clinical site, insulin administration, or hemoglobin A1c. Conclusions: Interstitial glucose measurements with the FreeStyle Libre system were found to be accurate compared with capillary BG reference values, with accuracy remaining stable over 14 days of wear and unaffected by patient characteristics.",

            "text": "C apillary and venous blood glucose (BG) values are typically used as reference to evaluate the accuracy of in vivo sensor devices. [1][2][3][4][5] Clinical laboratories use venous samples analyzed using a laboratory analyzer, whereas lay users use capillary BG measurements measured using a glucose meter for the calibration of sensors. [6][7][8] Glucose concentrations between the capillary and venous samples differ, and therefore the sample type used for calibration versus reference measurement may influence the results of an accuracy evaluation. 9,10 The FreeStyle \u00d2 Libre\u00d4 Flash glucose monitoring system (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA), hereafter referred to as the ''System,'' is an interstitial glucose monitoring system intended to be a replacement for the capillary BG measurement. Therefore, capillary BG may be considered an appropriate comparator in evaluating the performance and accuracy of this factory-only calibrated System. Additionally, capillary BG provides more reference points and represents real-life accuracy during daily patient use.",

The wired enzyme sensor is calibrated in the factory and therefore requires no user calibration during 14 days of wear. This feature differs from existing sensors, which require multiple fingerstick BG measurements over the life of the sensor for calibration. 11,12 The entire System's on-body sensor patch worn on the back of the upper arm is disposable after use. The hand-held reader with the built-in FreeStyle Precision BG meter is used to scan the sensor to receive a glucose result along with historic results with a 15-min frequency for up to 8 h. The BG readings on the built-in meter are independent of, and do not influence, sensor readings. The System displays trends and alerts on the Reader but does not have real-time alarms, which may provide a good option for individuals who complain of alarm fatigue. 11,13 The objective of this article is to describe the performance and usability of the System by comparing its scanned sensor results with capillary BG values measured using the built-in BG meter. Performance against the venous blood reference is provided for comparison.",

Immediately after each BG test, participants obtained a confirmation of a successful sensor scan.

There was no manipulation of the glucose levels of the subjects except for their normal meal and insulin doses. Capillary BG tests coincided with venous YSI samples drawn during in-clinic visits.

Study results showed agreement between the System's sensor readings and capillary BG and venous reference. The capillary BG reference provided a wider distribution of glucose results and covered up to 14 days of wear. Therefore, capillary BG was used as the primary comparator for the System's performance evaluation. Capillary BG reference provides more reference points and represents real-life accuracy during daily patient use. One strip lot was used as the capillary BG reference across all clinical sites and sensor lots so there were adequate data to determine variation between sensor lots and sites without confounding results with multiple strip lots.",

This lack of reliance on an external BG monitor for calibration is a potential advantage as errors in BG meters could potentially lead to glucose monitoring system errors. Sensors requiring routine user calibration several times daily can be affected by glucose instability, such as observed postprandially. 15 Sensor delays or lag between interstitial readings and venous or capillary readings have also been shown to vary among sensors, 16 with newergeneration sensors demonstrating less lag time. 15,17,18 Differences among interstitial, 14,19,20 capillary, and venous readings must also be considered when comparing accuracy outcomes. 9,10,[21][22][23] Sources contributing to differences between capillary BG versus venous YSI readings include the amount of blood used for testing, delays in analysis from the time of sampling, and differences in the composition of the blood samples. 9,10 Collectively, these differences limit the direct comparison of accuracy outcomes among sensor technologies. Therefore, the present study was compared with reported outcomes with similar wired enzyme technology, factory-calibrated sensors, and those reporting accuracy outcomes using Consensus EGA.

Accuracy of the System was similar across 14 days of sensor wear with the exception of the first day of wear, which had the lowest accuracy (Consensus EGA showed 72.0% in Zone A for Day 1 compared with 88.4% in Zone A for Day 2). This may be due in part to the body's natural inflammatory response to sensor insertion, which has been shown to affect glucose concentration in interstitial fluid. 26 In the present study, the System's sensor did not show any marked differences in accuracy outcomes relative to BMI, age, type of diabetes, clinical site, insulin administration, or hemoglobin A1c. In comparison, the accuracy (Clarke EGA) of the FreeStyle Navigator \u00d2 sensor (Abbott Diabetes Care), which used a sensor with the same wired enzyme technology, as reported by Weinstein et al., 27 did not differ as a function of age, sex, ethnicity, years since diagnosis of diabetes, or sensors worn on either the arm or abdomen but differed depending on the subject's BMI. The percentage of readings in Zone A (Clarke EGA) for participants who had a BMI of <25 kg/m 2 was 78.8% compared with 84.4% for participants with a BMI of >30 kg/m 2 , which the authors suggested could have been attributed to differences in blood flow relative to subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness. The present study with the System included a broad range of BMI (18.7-47.2 kg/m 2 ), which did not affect the sensor accuracy. Placement of the System's sensor was on both arms for each subject, and future studies could evaluate the effects of sensor accuracy in different locations on the body.",

This type of monitoring system may benefit individuals who have ceased sensor use due to alarm fatigue, becoming overwhelmed by alarms. 11 Limitations of the current study are single body site used for data collection, limited venous reference data over the 14-day wear due to practical limitation of obtaining blood, and a limited number of sensor lots used in the study.
