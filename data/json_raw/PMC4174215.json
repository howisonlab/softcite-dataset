This approach spares a significant percentage of the native breast tissue, which increases the potential for improved cosmetic outcomes. However, there are reports in the literature that the aesthetic benefits of BCT may not be shared equally among ethnic groups as both clinical experience and limited evidence in the literature suggest that African American women"

[1][2][3] For example, previous studies have identified 19-28% of African American patients as having fair/poor outcomes (72-81% with excellent/ good outcomes) compared with 5-18% of white patients who have fair/poor outcomes (82-95% with excellent/good outcomes). [1][2][3] However, these studies are hampered by 2 main issues: first, there is no consensus as to what constitutes an optimal aesthetic result following BCT, and second, no validated assessment instrument of aesthetic outcomes exists to help form such a consensus. 4,5 Although it is likely that there are many factors that affect aesthetic outcomes following BCT such as scarring and reaction to radiation, these variables are not captured in existing assessments. [1][2][3]6 This lack of specificity is significant given that preserving breast aesthetics is one of the primary goals of BCT. If the factors that influence aesthetic outcomes following BCT can be established, it may be possible to tailor treatment regimens to optimize aesthetics while preserving oncologic efficacy.",

            "text": "The existing literature does not provide a clear picture regarding ethnic differences in cosmetic outcome following BCT. This is in large part due to the fact that currently there is no consensus regarding optimal methods of measurement of cosmetic outcome following BCT. 4,5 Numerous researchers from  8,9 surgical oncology, 10 radiation oncology, 1,3,[11][12][13][14][15] and even multidisciplinary teams, [16][17][18][19][20] have assessed cosmetic outcomes, using a variety of techniques. The vast majority of studies have evaluated results using some variation of a 4-point rating scale, frequently in conjunction with a questionnaire that evaluates a global form of cosmesis. Although investigators have used validated instruments to evaluate BCT outcomes, 19 these measures only provided a general measure of patient satisfaction with their results and did not allow for specific identifiers in cosmesis, which could reveal dissatisfaction with the surgical scar, breast symmetry, or other variables. It remains that there is no consensus regarding optimal methods of measurement of cosmetic outcome, 4,5 and the question of ethnic differences in cosmetic outcome remains unanswered. Other techniques that have been used by researchers include directly measuring anatomic differences between the patient's treated and untreated breasts, then using these measurements to extrapolate the relative symmetry between the breasts. In the past, these measurements were made on postoperative pictures [11][12][13]15 and patients were given symmetry scores. In addition, researchers evaluated the breasts for the presence of visible changes after BCT, such as telangiectasias or nipple retraction, which were also assigned scores. In more recent studies, 3-dimensional photographic analysis 20 and sophisticated computer programs 21 have been developed to evaluate breast symmetry and cosmesis. Although these objective forms of measurement are clearly effective in identifying breast asymmetry after BCT, they cannot assess breast texture, sensitivity, or fibrosis. Perhaps most importantly, they only provide an objective measure of results and do not take into account the patient's opinion of their cosmesis, which arguably may provide the most important perspective.",

            "text": "This study represents an attempt to not only identify the factors that contribute to specific differences in cosmetic outcome between African American and white patients but also to quantify these differences and include the patient's opinion in the rating of the appearance of the breasts. Given our small cohort, we cannot provide a definitive statement regarding causation for perceived differences in cosmetic outcomes. With a larger sample size, it may be possible to identify subtle differences in rating that could identify areas of poor cosmesis that may be amenable to surgical correction. However, it is interesting to note that the objective measurements of breast volumetric differences and breast symmetric differences are similar between the white and African American groups (less than 20 cm 3 volume and less than 1 cm difference between the 2 groups), yet all 4 observers (plastic surgeon, breast oncologic surgeon, research assistant, and patient) consistently rated the African American patients as having worse results with regard to breast mound symmetry and appearance. Moreover, there was also a statistically significant difference in the way that African American patients rated the appearance of their skin when compared with white patients. It is possible that despite having similar objective measures of cosmesis, African American patients themselves perceive and are perceived by others as having worse cosmetic outcomes than white patients. This is an interesting finding as it implies that surgical technique may not be enough to achieve better outcomes-a psychological component may play a role as well. As this study progresses and the measures used to evaluate cosmesis become more clearly defined, these findings can be further investigated. The ICC rating of the nipple-areola complex and breast mound demonstrated fair to good IRR, which indicates the effectiveness of the questionnaire that was developed for this study. With continued validation techniques and the acquisition of more data, this questionnaire could become a valuable tool in helping quantify cosmetic outcomes following BCT. In the areas of the questionnaire relating to scarring and response to radiation, the difference between white and African American patients was larger than in the other measures of cosmesis that were evaluated in this study. This finding agrees with the clinical experience of the investigators and reports in the literature, which suggests that African American patients experience more severe physical reactions to radiation than white patients, including hyperpigmentation and adverse scarring. [1][2][3] It has been suggested that these differences in response to radiation may have a genetic basis as single nucleotide polymorphisms may potentially play a role in radiation toxicity. 22 Again, without a clear measure of cosmesis, it is difficult to quantify adverse outcomes and therefore identify candidate patients for genetic analysis. Moreover, the ICC rating was poor for the scar ratings, so further steps could include the application of existing scar rating instruments to help further evaluate the variables examined in this study.",
