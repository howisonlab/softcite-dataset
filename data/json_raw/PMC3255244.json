            "text": "C-terminal mutations of CD20 constitute part of the mechanisms that resist rituximab therapy. Most CD20 having a C-terminal mutation was not recognized by L26 antibody. As the exact epitope of L26 has not been determined, expression and localization of mutated CD20 have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we revealed that the binding site of L26 monoclonal antibody is located in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of CD20 molecule, which was often lost in mutated CD20 molecules. This indicates that it is difficult to distinguish the mutation of CD20 from under expression of the CD20 protein. To detect comprehensive CD20 molecules including the resistant mutants, we developed a novel monoclonal antibody that recognizes the N-terminal cytoplasm region of CD20 molecule. We screened L26-negative cases with our antibody and found several mutations. A rituximab-binding analysis using the cryopreserved specimen that mutation was identified in CD20 molecules indicated that the C-terminal region of CD20 undertakes a critical role in presentation of the large loop in which the rituximab-binding site locates. Thus, combination of antibodies of two kinds of epitope permits the identification of C-terminal CD20 mutations associated with irreversible resistance to rituximab and may help the decision of the treatment strategy.",

            "text": "Previously, we reported that gene mutations of CD20 were somehow involved in resistance to rituximab therapy, and we proposed that C-terminal deletion mutations of CD20 might be related to relapse/resistance after rituximab therapy. 1 Many of these C-terminal truncated CD20 molecules were not recognized by the L26 monoclonal antibody used routinely in most clinical laboratories. Therefore, expression of CD20 seemed to have been completely lost for these lymphomas. However, an immunohistochemical study using a polyclonal antibody showed that some kind of C-terminal truncated CD20 was present in cytoplasm, so it was possible that the epitope of L26 was lost by gene mutations. 1 L26 recognizes the cytoplasmic region of CD20 molecules, but no more detailed information about its epitope had been reported. 2,3 In this study, we determine a recognition site of L26 by using a series of deletion mutants of CD20 molecules. In addition, to detect every one of the mutated CD20 molecules, we developed new antibodies that recognize the N-terminal region of CD20 molecules. We used these antibodies to identify cells that have CD20 molecules with abnormalities in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region. We characterized these mutated CD20 molecules using living primary lymphoma cells.",

KMS12PE cells, in which expression of CD20 is not detected immunohistologically, were then transformed, and we established six kinds of sub-lines with the various C-terminal deletion mutations of CD20. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis using a primer set designed to amplify the CD20 N-terminal region indicated that no major difference was found in CD20 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the six cell lines (Figure 1b). We carried out immunocytochemical analysis using L26 and fluorescence-labeled rituximab against these six CD20expressing transfectants, along with a mock transfectant and Raji cells as negative and positive controls, respectively. The cells stained by L26 antibody were only those expressing wild type (amino acid 1-297) and DM1 mutant (amino acid 1-281). On the other hand, rituximab could bind to shorter CD20 molecules, such as DM2, DM3 or DM4, as well as to the CD20 molecules recognized by L26 ( Figure 1c). These results indicate that L26 antibody recognizes the C-terminal cytoplasm region of CD20 molecules and that its epitope is present in the amino-acid sequence of 264-281. The data suggest that immunohistochemistry using L26 antibody will exhibit a false negative if a deletion or a frame shift occurs upstream of this epitope. In addition, the shortest deletion mutant DM5 that lacked the C-terminal cytoplasmic region was detected by neither L26 antibody nor rituximab. Possible reasons might include the low membrane localization of DM5 mutant and/or low stability of the post-translational product. To clarify this, we carried out western blot analysis using total cell lysate of the series of deletion mutants that were tagged by FLAG peptide at the N-terminal region of CD20 constructs. We found that the cellular protein level of the DM5 deletion mutant of CD20 was remarkably lower than that of others, suggesting that low posttranslational stability may be the reason for the low antigenicity of DM5 mutant (data not shown).",

To determine the proportion of the genes, the PCR-amplified DNA fragments were inserted into a TA-cloning vector and 16 clones from both 'R-high' and 'R-low' fractions were determined the sequence of CD20. As a result, the ratio of mutant DNA accounted for approximately half of genomic DNA of both 'R-high' (7 out of 16) and 'R-low' (9 out of 16). On the other hand, the results of sequence analysis about the cDNA revealed that the ratio of mutant mRNA in 'R-low' was remarkably increased (14 out of 16), whereas that of 'R-high' was as the same of the results of genomic DNA (8 out of 16; Figure 4b). We also carried out a sequence analysis about genomic DNA from a slice of paraffin -embedded tissue of lymph node at the first diagnosis of this patient, and found that approximately half of the genomic DNA  included the mutant CD20 gene same as the cells at relapse (8 out of 16; Figure 4c). These results indicated that this patient had already carried the mutation in CD20 gene, as onset of primary lymphoma, and that a transcriptional imbalance of wild-type CD20 and mutated CD20 have occurred by undetermined mechanisms in some cell populations.  Figure 3 The analysis of primary lymphoma cells derived from pleural effusion of a patient with rituximab-refractory, diffuse large-cell lymphoma. (a) A direct sequence analysis of the CD20-coding region revealed that an adenine residue ( \u00fe 478) was deleted in about half of the cDNA. This gene mutation caused a frame shift after the amino-acid sequence of 250 and early denomination. The blue column in the protein schematic charts expresses an abnormal primary structure. *Single nucleotide deletion occurred at this position in approximately half of cDNA. As CD20 is thought to be present as a tetramer in cells, 7 mutated CD20 may affect also wild-type peptide in the same cell. To verify this possibility, we introduced the CD20 gene carrying the same mutation as this patient to CD20 \u00c0 cell line, KMS12PE and CD20 \u00fe Daudi using a retrovirus vector, then selected the cells expressing the exogeneous CD20 by a green fluorescent protein reporter promoted by an internal ribosome entry site (Figure 5a). As the result of evaluating the binding affinity to rituximab by flow cytometry, the exogeneous mutated CD20 exhibited remarkably attenuated antigenicity to rituximab as compared with the wild-type CD20 (Figure 5b). Next, we transformed Daudi cells with the mutant CD20 to examine the effect on expression of wild-type CD20 molecules.",

So the mutation in the CD20 gene has been less noticed with regard to resistance to rituximab. In the present study, we roughly identified the epitope of L26, and it became clear that all of the C-terminalmutated CD20 that we had found earlier lost the epitope for L26, because the epitope was located near the C-terminal of CD20 molecule. To detect CD20 with these mutations comprehensively, we developed monoclonal antibodies that recognize a part of the amino-acid sequence of the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of CD20. One of these antibodies, CD20N, recognized CD20 proteins, including those having a mutation in the paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed specimen. In this study, we showed that it could be applied to the primary screening of the lymphoma cells that express mutated CD20 by selecting L26-negative and CD20N-positive cells.",

In addition, Johnson et al. 8 carried out a sequencing screening of exon 5 of the CD20 gene encompassing the epitope of rituximab. They detected CD20 mutations involving the rituximab epitope in only 1/264 (0.4%) and 1/15 (6%) of the biopsies taken at diagnosis and relapse, respectively. Similarly, in our previous screening, no mutation was found in the region of exon 5, whereas four cases with mutation (out of 50) were found in the C-terminal cytoplasm region of CD20. 1 In the CD20 gene, a genetic mutation could be more likely to occur in the C-terminal region compared with around the region of rituximab epitope by uncertain mechanism(s). 10 0 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 LTR Figure 5 The effect of mutant CD20 on wild-type CD20 with respect to rituximab binding.

CD20 mutations of rituximab-resistant lymphoma Y Mishima et al By using live cryopreserved cells, derived from a newly identified case with the mutation in the CD20 gene, we successfully analyzed in detail the phenotype of lymphoma cells having mutated CD20. In this case, a frame shift mutation occurred because of one base nucleotide deletion, resulting in the translation of peptide of another reading frame of 41 amino acids after the amino acid position 250 with a slight early termination. Immunohistochemical analysis using CD20N antibody revealed that the CD20 molecules with C-terminal mutations were indeed expressed in the lymphoma cells, and located at the cell membrane. However, the living cell binding evaluation showed that rituximab could scarcely bind to these cells. These results suggest that the C-terminal region of CD20 undertakes a critical role in presentation of the large loop in which the rituximab-binding site locates.",

            "text": "(b) Rituximab-binding analysis based on three-dimensional imaging. Magnetically sorted living B-lineage cells were labeled with CD19 (green pseudo-color) and rituximab (red pseudo-color). Although the intensity varied, the CD19 antigen was expressed in most of the cells. Meanwhile, rituximab bound markedly to approximately half of the cells, but the binding to the rest of cells could not be detected. The blue pseudo-color indicates fluorescence of Hoechist22242 nuclear dye. Results shown here are representative of the 19 microscopic fields. (c) Flow cytometric analysis of mononuclear cells from the pleural effusion of this patient suggested that there were two populations of different CD20-expressing levels among CD19 positive cells. The mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of the higher (blue) and lower (red) CD20-expressing populations were calculated as 486.8 and 30.5, respectively. FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on a biopsied specimen of a lymph node at the first examination (a, b and c) and on a fibrin clot from the B-cell population from pleural effusion at the relapse phase (d, e and f). Both L26 and CD20N antibodies uniformly stained the lymphoma cells in the lymph node biopsy specimen (b and c, respectively). However, L26 did not recognize about half of the B cells derived from pleural effusion (e), whereas CD20N stained almost all the cells (f). (a and d) indicates hematoxylin and eosin (H/E) stain. High-magnification images of the region boxed in (a-f) were shown in (a 0 -f 0 ), respectively. An objective lens of \u00c2 60 was used, bar: 50 mm. PE lymphoma, lymphoma cell in pleural effusion.",
