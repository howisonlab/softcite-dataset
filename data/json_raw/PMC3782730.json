METHOD: The study group was composed of 56 healthy elderly subjects who underwent neuropsychological assessment and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging. Cluster analysis classified the cohort into two groups, one (cluster 1) in which the magnetic resonance imaging metrics were more preserved (mean age: 66.4 years) and another (cluster 2) with less preserved markers of healthy brain tissue (mean age: 75.4 years). RESULTS: The subjects in cluster 2 (older group) had worse indices of interference in the Stroop test compared with the subjects in cluster 1 (younger group). Therefore, a simple test such as the Stroop test could differentiate groups of younger and older subjects based on magnetic resonance imaging metrics. CONCLUSION: These results are in agreement with the inhibitory control hypotheses regarding cognitive aging and may also be important in the interpretation of studies with other clinical groups, such as patients with dementia and mild cognitive impairment.",

This fact has been documented not only in studies of brain volume, but also by other neuroimaging modalities sensitive to myelin impairment. Previous imaging reports showed volume decreases and diffusion facilitation related to aging. The loss of white matter (WM) integrity and gray matter (GM) volume is found mostly in the frontal lobe (1)(2)(3). The hippocampus also shows structural changes associated with aging, but they are less severe than those found in Alzheimer's disease and are not associated with the involvement of the area around the entorhinal cortex (1,4).",

Positive correlations have been found between AD and memory, executive functions, and frontal and temporal regions, whereas negative correlations have been described in elderly controls between executive functions, memory processes, and frontal regions (7). This result could be explained by the continual loss of cortical thickness and brain volume, including the \"pruning\" and neuronal reorganization inherent in human development, which results in the selection of the most capable neurons, leading elderly people with smaller brain volumes to exhibit performances that are higher than expected for their normative group. Other authors have reviewed the research in the past years and still encountered contradictory findings regarding the evidence that age-related changes in the volume of specific brain structures have direct consequences for cognitive function. Therefore, the relationships between structure (brain) and function (behavior and cognition) in healthy aging remain controversial.",

This software classifies each voxel with a neuroanatomical label based on probabilistic information automatically estimated from a manually labeled training set. Initially, an optimal linear transform was computed to maximize the likelihood of the input image based on an atlas constructed from manually labeled images. Next, a nonlinear transform was initialized with the transformation of the previous step, and the image was deformed until a better match of the atlas was obtained. Finally, a Bayesian segmentation procedure was applied, and the maximum a posteriori estimate of the labeling was computed. The technique has been previously shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual labeling (17). The Freesurfer system provides the volumes of the classified structures and cortical thickness values.",

This study began with the analyses of biological markers associated with MRI findings in two clusters, namely cluster 1 (mean 66.4 years), consisting of participants who had less volumetric change in MTR and qT2, and cluster 2 (mean 75.4 years), consisting of participants who had global atrophy, a low MTR, and a prolonged T2 time.

Another study using a cross-sectional, population-based VBM also revealed an accelerated gray matter loss exclusively in men, involving the temporal neocortex, prefrontal neocortex, and medial temporal regions (39). Even though our study included more women than men, it did not reveal differences related to gender. Subcortical structures were less affected by age than cortical structures, but significant differences (p,0.05) were found in the volume of the left thalamus proper, brain stem, left acumens area, and right cerebellum white matter, as well as bilaterally in the hippocampus, amygdale, and ventral diencephalon. These findings are comparable to those of other studies indicating that the greatest shrinkage across the lifespan occurs in the caudate, cerebellum, hippocampus,  and prefrontal areas (6). Previous studies also argued that subcortical structures, such as the striatum, have not been extensively studied in aging, and similarly little is known about changes in the volume of the cerebellum (5,40,41). According to the present study, the subcortical structures do not seem to change significantly with age, as we verified more involvement of the cortical regions.",

The MTR has been extensively used for the assessment of central nervous system WM lesions in different diseases, especially in MS, in which the MTR is used to predict disease progression (45)(46)(47)(48). Although brain atrophy may be associated with the MTR decrease, pathological correlations have demonstrated that the main cause of the MTR decrease is demyelination. In addition, in normal-appearing WM, the MTR decrease correlates with axonal attenuation. Therefore, we speculate that the MTR decrease in our cohort may be explained by a combination of neuronal and axonal damage and demyelination related to aging.",

The analysis of the MTR in this study indicated lower values in the anterior regions of the brain in cluster 2, suggesting that this group of older elderly individuals with less preserved brain volume and worse neuropsychological scores possesses smaller areas of myelination than cluster 1.

From a functional point of view, these results are in accordance with the inhibitory control hypotheses regarding cognitive aging. Investigations of the normal spectrum of aging are essential for the study of the pre-clinical stages of all degenerative processes associated with aging and can highlight some biological and neuropsychological markers of incipient cases of dementia.",
