RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-According to a randomized crossover design, 18 type 2 diabetic patients (aged 59 \u03ee 5 years; BMI 27 \u03ee 3 kg/m 2) (means \u03ee SD) in satisfactory blood glucose control on diet or diet plus metformin followed a diet relatively rich in carbohydrates (52% total energy), rich in fiber (28g/1,000 kcal), and with a low glycemic index (58%) (high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet) or a diet relatively low in carbohydrate (45%) and rich in monounsaturated fat (23%) (low-carbohydrate/high-monounsaturated fat diet) for 4 weeks. Thereafter, they shifted to the other diet for 4 more weeks. At the end of each period, plasma glucose, insulin, lipids, and lipoprotein fractions (separated by discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation) were determined on blood samples taken at fasting and over 6 h after a test meal having a similar composition as the corresponding diet. RESULTS-In addition to a significant decrease in postprandial plasma glucose, insulin responses, and glycemic variability, the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet also significantly improved the primary end point, since it reduced the postprandial incremental areas under the curve (IAUCs) of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, in particular, chylomicrons (cholesterol IAUC: 0.05 \u03ee 0.01 vs. 0.08 \u03ee 0.02 mmol/l per 6 h; triglycerides IAUC: 0.71 \u03ee 0.35 vs. 1.03 \u03ee 0.58 mmol/l per 6 h, P \u03fd 0.05). CONCLUSIONS-A diet rich in carbohydrate and fiber, essentially based on legumes, vegetables, fruits, and whole cereals, may be particularly useful for treating diabetic patients because of its multiple effects on different cardiovascular risk factors, including postprandial lipids abnormalities.",

If we consider that humans spend most of their time in the postprandial condition and that all the lipid alterations in this state greatly outnumber those occurring in fasting conditions, diet is the natural approach to correct postprandial abnormalities. However, while it has been repeatedly demonstrated that dietary treatment in type 2 diabetic patients is able to improve glucose control and blood lipids at fasting (6), there are few data on the effects of various diets on postprandial lipemia (7). The Mediterranean diet is generally recommended as a useful nutritional tool for the prevention of cardiovascular disease because it is able to act positively on the main cardiovascular risk factors, including excess body weight (8). However, the two main components of the Mediterranean diet-olive oil rich in monounsaturated fat and foods rich in carbohydrate and fibertraditionally found in association in the Mediterranean diet of some decades ago are now often considered in opposition. In particular, a diet rich in carbohydrate is considered less effective on fasting lipid metabolism than one rich in monounsaturated fat (MUFA), as it induces higher plasma triglycerides concentrations (22%) and lower HDL cholesterol levels (4%) (9); these untoward effects, however, can be avoided by selecting carbohydrate rich foods with high fiber content and a low glycemic index (10).",

After a run-in period of 4 weeks, during which patients were stabilized on their own diet, they followed, in alternate order, two isoenergetic diets, each for 4 weeks. One diet was relatively rich in carbohydrate, rich in dietary fiber both of soluble and insoluble type, and with a low glycemic index; the other was rich in MUFA, relatively low in carbohydrate, low in dietary fiber, and with a relatively high glycemic index ( Table 1). The glycemic load of the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet was lower than that of the high-MUFA diet (155 vs. 205). The other components of the two diets, in particular, the saturated fat content, were similar (Table 1). Calories and nutrients of the diets were calculated from tables of food composition of the Italian Institute of Nutrition using the MetaDieta software (Meteda s.r.l., Ascoli-Piceno, Italy). The main components of the two diets were as follows: 1) a portion of legumes four times a week, one serving of pasta twice a week, and one serving of parboiled rice once a week; two servings of vegetables and two fruits per day; and whole-grain bread for the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet and 2) white bread, a serving of potatoes, rice, or pasta each twice weekly; a serving of pizza once a week; and use of vegetables and fruits low in fiber for the low-carbohydrate diet (a weekly meal schedule for both dietary treatments is shown in an online appendix, Tables S1 and S2, available at http://care.diabetesjournals. org/cgi/content/full/dc09-0266/DC1).",

We looked at the possible effects of the two diets on lipolysis in adipose tissue, considering the crucial role of this tissue in partitioning the postprandial lipids (11). However, both LPL and HSL activities were not different at the end of either diet. This suggests that the two diets might act on other sites, particularly on those involved in the absorption of dietary fatty acids and cholesterol and the production of chylomicrons and VLDL, not only through their nutrient composition but also for their different combination of foods and for the presence of other components. On the one hand, since low-carbohydrate/high-MUFA diets are richer in the amount of fat, which is one of the main determinants of postprandial lipid response (22), they may induce a higher absorption of dietary fatty acids, which would result in a higher intestinal production of chylomicrons. On the other hand, since the highcarbohydrate/high-fiber diet is at the same time rich in carbohydrate and dietary fiber, it may act in different ways, i.e., by slowing down gastric empting; reducing the absorption of glucose, choles- terol, and fatty acids; and, finally, reducing the intestinal production and secretion of chylomicrons, as suggested by studies performed both in vitro and in vivo (23). Moreover, since the highcarbohydrate/high-fiber diet also reduces postprandial plasma glucose and insulin, it is likely that both effects may reduce de novo lipogenesis, which is stimulated by glucose and insulin levels (23) and may be particularly relevant in type 2 diabetic patients, where it accounts for 25% of VLDL synthesis (24). Moreover, our highcarbohydrate diet, being rich in fiber, also induced an improvement in insulin resistance, as suggested by the lower insulinto-glucose ratios, which is relevant given the well-known key role played by insulin resistance in determining postprandial lipoprotein abnormalities (25).",
