            "text": "Inflammation is an integral component of autoimmune arthritis. The balance of pathogenic T helper 17 (Th17) and protective T regulatory (Treg) cells can influence disease severity, and its resetting offers an attractive approach to control autoimmunity. We determined the frequency of Th17 and Treg in the joints of rats with adjuvant arthritis (AA), a model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We also investigated the impact of Celastrol, a bioactive compound from the traditional Chinese medicine Celastrus that can suppress AA, on Th17/Treg balance in the joints. Celastrol treatment reduced Th17 cells but increased Treg in the joints, and it inhibited Th17 differentiation but promoted Treg differentiation in vitro by blocking the activation of pSTAT3. Furthermore, Celastrol limited the production of Th17-differentiating cytokines and chemokines (CCL3, CCL5). Thus, Celastrol suppressed arthritis in part by altering Th17/Treg ratio in inflamed joints, and it should be tested as a potential adjunct/alternative for RA therapy.",

            "text": "Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration into the synovium, synovial hyperplasia, angiogenesis, and cartilage and bone damage [1; 2; 3]. A variety of anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs are available for the treatment of RA, but their prolonged use is frequently associated with severe adverse reactions. The new category of drugs, the biologics, such as antibodies and/or decoy receptors aimed at neutralizing the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 have made a major impact on the management of RA [4; 5; 6]. However, about 30-40% of patients either fail to respond or become unresponsive over time to these newer medications, and there is increased risk of infections in patients treated with biologics. In addition, biologics are expensive. Thus, newer anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic therapeutic products are being sought. Natural products belonging to the traditional systems of medicine represent a promising resource in this regard [7]. However, for acceptance into the mainstream therapy, it is imperative that the mechanisms of action of herbal products for treatment of autoimmune diseases are better defined in context of the contemporary immune parameters.",

IL-17 plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of AA [13]. However, little is known about the relative frequency of Th17 and Treg in arthritic joints in rats with AA and the influence of anti-arthritic agents on these cellular parameters. We have previously shown that Celastrol possesses anti-arthritic activity as tested in the rat AA model [14]. Furthermore, it can inhibit IL-6 production and pSTAT3 activation implying that it might influence Th17 differentiation [14]. Accordingly, we hypothesized that Celastrol limits the progression of arthritis in part by altering the Th17/ Treg balance in the target organ to facilitate immune regulation. In addition, Celastrol may influence T cell activation and cellular migration into the joints. Our results support these propositions.",

The number of CD4 + T cells producing IL-17 was significantly reduced from an average of 68.8% in vehicle-treated rats to 21.8% in Celastrol-treated animals (n=8, p<0.05) ( Figure 1A, top right).

The cytokine cocktails for the differentiation of mouse and human na\u00efve T cells are well-defined. In mice, the synergistic action of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 in the presence of anti-IL-2 facilitates the differentiation of T cells into Th17 cells, driving ROR\u03b3t expression and IL-17 production. In contrast, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2 drive the expression of Foxp3 and differentiation of Treg cells [15]. To ascertain if Celastrol had any direct inhibitory effect on Th17 differentiation, we cultured na\u00efve CD4+ mouse T cells for 72 h with and without Celastrol under defined cytokine conditions. Treatment with Celastrol markedly decreased Th17 differentiation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3A, bottom  panel). Moreover, ROR\u03b3t, the transcription factor that regulates Th17 cell differentiation, was also reduced ( Figure 3B). The dose-dependent inhibition of Th17 activation and differentiation by Celastrol was also seen in na\u00efve human CD4 + T cells differentiated with IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-23, and TGF-\u03b2 (data not shown).",

We hypothesized that this was in part due to inhibition of the IL-6 signaling pathway, which resulted in exogenous TGF-\u03b2 and endogenous IL-2 mimicking the Treg differentiation environment. To test this, we incubated mouse CD4+ T cells with rIL-6 with and without Celastrol. The IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) consists of the IL-6R\u03b1 and gp130, and signals through a pSTAT3 homodimer with some ancillary pSTAT5. Our results show that Celastrol treatment resulted in a decrease in STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation ( Figure 4A), as well as STAT3-induced expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) ( Figure 4B). SOCS3 is a STAT3-induced gene that acts as a phosphatase and dephosphorylates STAT3 in a negative feedback-loop. The gene expression of SOCS3 was used to determine if the reduction in pSTAT3 caused by Celastrol treatment was due to a block in STAT3 signaling or an increase in SOCS3 expression. The decrease in SOCS3 expression and pSTAT3 suggests that Celastrol can directly inhibit Th17 differentiation and promote Treg differentiation in part by blocking IL-6R signaling pathway.",

Celastrol treatment of arthritic rats led to decreased production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 by both SAC and SIC compared to vehicle treatment, when tested ex vivo ( Figure 5A). Similarly, SAC obtained from an untreated arthritic rat and then restimulated with Mtb sonicate in the presence of Celastrol in vitro showed reduction in both the gene expression (which cannot distinguish between pro and mature forms of IL-1\u03b2) ( Figure 5B, top) and the level of protein corresponding to pro-IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 by western blot analysis ( Figure 5B,  bottom). However, SAC obtained from Celastrol-treated rats and restimulated with Mtb in vitro without subsequent exposure to Celastrol in vitro showed marked reduction in the expression of the active (mature) form of IL-1\u03b2, but relatively much less reduction in pro-IL-1\u03b2 ( Figure 5C, bottom), but without much effect on gene expression for IL-1\u03b2 ( Figure  5C, top). The above-mentioned reduced production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 following Celastrol treatment correlates with inhibition of NF-kB activity by Celastrol, as tested using an NF-kB reporter assay ( Figure 5D). Furthermore, a reduction in the release of mature IL-1\u03b2 following in vivo Celastrol treatment suggests that Celastrol might inhibit IL-1\u03b2 maturation steps.",

SAC obtained from an arthritic rat were restimulated for 24 h with Mtb sonicate in the presence or absence of an inflammasome inhibitor, a caspase-1 inhibitor, an MMP-9 inhibitor, or a serine protease inhibitor, separately. There was a marked reduction in the release of mature IL-1\u03b2 in response to Mtb stimulation in cells treated with each of these inhibitors except MMP-9 inhibitor ( Figure 5E). These findings suggest that IL-1\u03b2 maturation in SAC following Mtb stimulation involves both inflammasome-dependent as well as inflammasome-independent mechanisms. Importantly, all these enzymes (caspase-1, serine protease, and MMP9) have been reported to be inhibited by Celastrol in in vitro systems by other investigators [16; 17] and us [14]. Taken together, our results show that Celastrol can inhibit the in vivo generation of cytokines (T cell-extrinsic effects) that are critical for Th17 differentiation and progression of autoimmune arthritis.",

Therefore, we determined whether Celastrol might influence cellular migration and antigen-induced T cell response. Examination of the SIC showed a decrease in the frequency and the number of neutrophils and CD4 + T cells in the joints of Celastrol-treated rats compared to vehicle-treated controls ( Figure 6A). This corresponded with a reduction in the production of IL-17 production by Th17 cells and proinflammatory chemokines CCL3 and CCL5 by the SIC in Celastrol-treated group compared to the control group ( Figure 6B). Further, Celastrol also inhibited the chemotactic migration of lymph node cells (LNC) in vitro ( Figure 6C). In addition to reducing the cellular migration of LNC, Celastrol markedly reduced the T cell proliferative response to arthritisrelated antigens (e.g., Mtb, mycobacterial hsp65 (Bhsp65), and rat hsp65 (Rhsp65)), but the response to an irrelevant control antigen was unaffected ( Figure 6D). Taken together, these results suggest that Celastrol has the potential to inhibit the expansion of antigen-reactive T cells and the migration of inflammatory cells into an arthritic joint.",

Given the functional attributes of Th17 and Treg, this change in their balance favors an anti-inflammatory/ immunomodulatory local environment in the inflamed tissue. Therefore, we suggest that a reduction in Th17/Treg ratio by Celastrol in part contributes to the anti-arthritic activity of this herbal product. The resetting of Th17/Treg balance by Celastrol is a novel finding in regard to the mechanism of action of this natural product.",

For example, the number of IL-17 producing T cells are increased in the synovial fluid of RA patients and have an inverse relationship with that of Treg cells [18]. The reversal of the Th17/Treg imbalance in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells has been observed in clinical trials using conventional single therapy tocilizumab (human anti-IL-6) [19]. Similarly, vasoactive intestinal peptide and grape seed proanthocyanidin extract have been shown to alter the Th17/Treg ratio in splenocytes in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) [20; 21]. In another study on AA but in Wistar rats, Celastrol was found to be more effective than Digoxin in suppressing arthritis [16]. Further, Digoxin, a known inhibitor of ROR\u03b3t, was found to reduce the frequency of IL-17-producing cells in the spleen of treated rats. The above studies highlight the utility of natural products for the treatment of experimental arthritis. Earlier, an extract of Tripterygium wilfordii and its bioactive component triptolide were shown to be effective in the treatment of RA [22], and snake venom has been shown to suppress adjuvant arthritis [23], further reinforcing the potential of the vast resource of natural products for the treatment of RA.",

The cytokine cocktail required for rat Th17/Treg differentiation has not been reported in the literature. Accordingly, we tested Celastrol on mouse CD4 + T cells. Celastrol was able to reduce the frequency of IL-17-producing mouse CD4 + T cells. We also showed one potential mechanism of Celastrol, namely reduction in pSTAT3 (T cell-intrinsic effect), which plays an important role in modulating Th17/Treg balance [24]. Many Th17-specific inhibitors have been developed, but have not been tested on Treg [25]. In contrast, a molecule like Celastrol can reduce Th17, while enhancing Treg differentiation, potentially controlling arthritis via two synergistic mechanisms. Our findings on this reciprocal effect of Celastrol on Th17 and Treg are supported by similar results using STA-21, a STAT3 specific inhibitor, in the CIA model of RA [26].",

Therefore, these two cytokines, which are produced by myeloid cells (macrophage and dendritic cells) during inflammatory conditions, are valid targets for influencing T cell subset differentiation. In this regard, our results showed that Celastrol treatment can significantly reduce the levels of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 produced by myeloid cells (e.g., spleen adherent cells), offering a T cellextrinsic mechanism of Celastrol-induced inhibition of Th17 differentiation under inflammatory conditions. Additional support is derived from our results along with those of others [29] showing that Celastrol has an inhibitory effect on NF-kB, the master transcription factor that regulates the production of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. In the case of IL-1\u03b2, pro-IL-1\u03b2 production is regulated by NF-\u03baB, whereas production of mature IL-1\u03b2 from pro-IL-1\u03b2 involves the action of enzymes such as caspase-1, caspase-11, or others [30]. The reduction in pro-IL-1\u03b2 by Celastrol can be explained by the inhibition of NF-kB [29], whereas the decrease in mature IL-1\u03b2 points to a likely additional direct effect of Celastrol on the conversion of pro-IL-1\u03b2 into mature IL-1\u03b2. We are currently examining the effect of Celastrol on enzymes involved in the generation of mature IL-1\u03b2.",

The Th1, Th17, and Treg cells were detected by intracellular staining for IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, and Foxp3, respectively. Data from 4-5 independent experiments (n = 3 rats per group) are presented. (B) Total SIC from arthritic rats treated with Celastrol or vehicle were stimulated ex vivo with Mtb sonicate. Chemokines in cell supernatants were measured by Multiplex assay. (C) LNC derived from untreated arthritic rats were allowed to migrate using a Transwell membrane in the presence of CCL3 or CCL5 (50 ng/mL) and Celastrol at the indicated concentrations. Cells treated with vehicle served as controls for Celastrol-treated cells (n = 3). (Where indicated, the error bars represent SEM.). (D) Celastrol limits T cell proliferative responses to arthritis-related antigens in lymph nodes. Ex vivo T cell recall responses to arthritis-related antigens were measured using LNC of Celastrol-/vehicle-treated rats. The draining LNC from these rats were harvested 18 d after Mtb-immunization and tested in a proliferation assay using the indicated recall antigens (mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 3).
