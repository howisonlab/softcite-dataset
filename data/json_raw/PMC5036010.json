            "text": "Objective: To explore whether information regarding potentially alcohol-related health incidents recorded in electronic patient records might aid in earlier identification of alcohol use disorders. Design: We extracted potentially alcohol-related information in electronic patient records and tested if alcohol-related diagnoses, prescriptions of codeine, tramadol, ethylmorphine, and benzodiazepines; elevated levels of gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT), and mean cell volume (MCV); and new sick leave certificates predicted specific alcohol use disorder. Setting: Nine general practitioner surgeries with varying size and stability. Subjects: Totally 20,764 patients with active electronic patient record until data gathering and with a history of at least four years without a specific alcohol use disorder after turning 18 years of age. Methods: The Cox proportional hazard analysis with time-dependent covariates of potential accumulated risks over the previous four years. Main outcome measures: Time from inclusion until the first specific alcohol use disorder, defined by either an alcohol specific diagnostic code or a text fragment documenting an alcohol problem. Results: In the unadjusted and adjusted Cox-regression with time-dependent covariates all variables were highly significant with adjusted hazard ratios ranging from 1.25 to 3.50. Addictive drugs, sick leaves, GGT, MCV and International Classification for Primary Care version 2 (ICPC-2), and International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) diagnoses were analyzed. Elevated GGT and MCV, ICD-10-diagnoses, and gender demonstrated the highest hazard ratios. Conclusions: Many frequent health problems are potential predictors of an increased risk or vulnerability for alcohol use disorders. However, due to the modest hazard ratios, we were unable to establish a clinically useful tool. KEY POINTS Alcohol is potentially relevant for many health problems, but current strategies for identification and intervention in primary health care have not been successful. Many frequent clinical problems recorded in electronic patient records may indicate an increased risk for alcohol related health problems. The hazard ratios were modest and the resulting predictive model was unsatisfactory for diagnostic purposes. If we accepted a sensitivity as low as 0.50, the specificity slightly exceeded 0.75. With a low prevalent condition, it is obvious that the false positive problem will be vast. In addition to responding to elevated blood levels of liver enzymes, general practitioners should be aware of alcohol as a potentially relevant factor for patients with repeated events of many mental and psychosocial diagnoses and new sick leaves and repeated prescriptions of addictive drugs.",

            "text": "General practitioners (GPs) as health care providers for the general public are important actors in dealing with alcohol-related health problems. [1] The link between alcohol consumption and numerous health problems is strong, and earlier identification of risky or harmful drinking is regarded essential, both in public health terms and for the individual patient. [2][3][4] The preferred method for identification and treatment of risky or harmful drinking has, for the past decades, been screening and brief intervention (SBI), but important questions concerning the effectiveness of SBI in routine health care settings remain unanswered. [5,6] Furthermore, recent large scale implementation studies have failed to show effect. [7][8][9] However, it is known that GPs regard dealing with alcohol-related health problems a legitimate part of their responsibility. [10][11][12][13] The recent recognition of the lack of robust evidence for SBI in routine health care settings necessitates further research. Recently, approaches based on clinical relevance instead of screening measures have been studied. [14][15][16] Health incidents or changes in the patient's life are used as indicators of potential relevance for addressing alcohol. These have been coined as pragmatic case finding [14] or semi-systematic method, [15] they not only focus primarily on clinical signs, but also focus on targeted screening in some routine situations. These strategies focus on the present clinical situation and the awareness that alcohol may be relevant for a patient's health, both as a possible cause and as a complicating factor for their health problems. GPs struggle with asking about alcohol out of context, as in general screening, but asking based on potential relevance in a specific clinical situation is probably a better foundation for interventions. [17,18] In general practice, the patient records will often contain information gathered through many years. Almost all GPs in Norway use electronic patient records (EPR), but the systems are not highly functional in systematizing relevant information. [19] Not only the patient's present health problem, but also previous incidents may indicate relevance for talking about alcohol.",

We wanted to include as outcome situations where an AUD was documented in the running text of the EPR, but where no formal diagnosis was made. We identified the word ''alcohol'' in the running text, either alone or as a compound word (in Norwegian compound words are frequently used when the English expression would contain two or three words, e.g., ''alkoholmisbruk'', English: alcohol abuse). Compound words highly indicative of an AUD were defined as an AUD text fragment. All versions of compound words containing ''alcohol'' were assessed manually and either defined as an AUD text fragment or not. The validity of this AUD text fragment was tested by performing a second data collection in one surgery to explore the context of the AUD text fragment by manually assessing a 12 word text fragment with the compound word with ''alcohol'' in the middle. This was done for a three-year period (January 2001 to December 2003) in one of the surgeries of medium size. We found 102 fragments which had been defined as AUD text fragments, and for 20 of these (20%) it was evident that the alcohol problem in question was someone else's, most frequently a parent. We also identified 171 text fragments with ''alcohol'' originally not identified as an AUD text fragment. Of these, as many as 105 (60%) dealt with a real alcohol problem for the patient. Many of the patients had several such text fragments. This suggests that our method of defining an AUD text fragment is more prone to underestimate than overestimate the prevalence of an AUD.",

In old age, the number of health problems rapidly increase,  and collecting data for the prediction of future health problems is less relevant. Other data from the EPRs than the chosen variables were not collected, apart from gender, year of birth, doctor and surgery, and first and last entry in the EPR. We chose to exclude predictor events more than four years prior to a predictor event, because recent events in a patient's life, documented in the EPR, probably have a higher impact on present health.

We have chosen to exclude predictor events more than four years prior to the present event. Previous events sum up and constitute an ever increasing risk, but previous difficulties and problems are also overcome and sometimes balanced by positive experiences. While events early in life may have strong effects on present and future health, information in the EPR will probably not be a strong indicator of relevant events in early lifetime. [37] If our choice of predictors has been adequate, the results indicate that using patient record data to establish a threshold value for identifying an AUD is futile because of lack of sensitivity and specificity. But our findings point to the fact that many frequent clinical problems normally not conceived as caused by alcohol consumption, over time may be related to alcohol consumption. The predictor events constituting a potential risk, as well as the opportunities to intervene, increase over time in general practice. Even interventions with minor effect may potentially add up in the long run, when applied many times and for many patients. [38,39] SBI has shown a lack of diagnostic accuracy, intervention efficacy, and feasibility. [8,11,17,40] Methods focusing on the present situation and the patient's problem will probably increase relevance and recognition for the patient. [14,15,18] We should bear in mind that alcohol use may represent attempts to master a challenging life as viewed from the patients' perspective. [41] An open and respectful dialogue is needed to explore how alcohol may be relevant for health, coping and well-being.",

Because of a maximum observation period of 21 years, many doctors have been replaced over the years, thus several doctors may have been responsible for each patient's EPR. The resulting diagnostic variability probably reduces the internal validity of the study, but strengthens the external validity. [42] When facing uncertainty, the result of the diagnostic process will vary greatly between doctors. [43] Many address alcohol and document the interventions without proper diagnosis, but it is also likely that many interventions are not documented in the EPR. In addition, we have also demonstrated that c-AUD underestimated real alcohol problems in patients at least in the EPRs that were examined. Since we have no direct assessments of the patients, we know nothing about the real prevalence of alcohol related health problems in the material. As the data are completely anonymous, we are not able to test our data against registers as the Cause of Death Registry or the Norwegian Registry Database, nor may we trace a patient moving from one surgery to another.",

In future studies, ICPC-2-diagnoses should probably be grouped in clinically meaningful clusters in order to be able to detect stronger correlations than we have found.
