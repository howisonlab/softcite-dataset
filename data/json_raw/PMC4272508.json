            "text": "Goal: The aim of the study was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of optical coherence tomography parameters in normal, preperimetric, developed perimetric and terminal glaucoma. Methods: 180 eyes of 140 consecutive patients were evaluated in this retrospective cross sectional pilot study. Copernicus Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography with resolution of 3 mm obtained through the optic nerve head were included. All examined eyes were divided into four groups (healthy eyes, initial, preperimetric glaucoma, developed perimetric glaucoma and terminal glaucoma). Results: The highest value of the RIM is noticed in control group 1,44 (1,21-1,70).There is no significant difference in the size of the disc in the eyes with developed open angle glaucoma (1,80 \u00b10,66) compared to normal eyes (p= 0,663), to the eyes with initial glaucoma (p=0,120), and terminal glaucomatous atrophy (p=0,068). There is statistically importance of E/D parameter in healthy group 0,17 (0,04-0,27), early glaucomatous group 0,44 (0,35-0,51), developed glaucoma 0,47 (0,39-0,61) respectively p<0,005. The volume of cup was significantly greater in the eyes with terminal glaucomatous atrophy 1,05 (0,85-1,4) compared to the healthy eyes 0,31 (0,06-0,51) (p < 0,005), significantly greater to initial glaucoma 0,84 (0,58-1,12) (p=0,007) and significantly higher compared to developed glaucoma 0,82 (0,62-1.07) (p=0,003). There is no significant difference in the cup between the eyes with early and developed glaucoma (p=0,912). The eyes with terminal glaucoma had significant lower value of the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer 56,50 (45,50-71,25) compared to developed glaucoma group 82,5 (72-95,75), initial glaucoma 110,50 (102-123) and healthy eyes 132 (119-150) (p <0,005). Conclusion: The SD-OCT scanning should be used to quantify optic nerve head anatomy in human eyes. The changes can be recognized and can indicate as important risk factor in considering glaucoma changes. It also should be considered as an exact model of glaucoma pathology. Key words: initial, perimetric and terminal glaucoma, optic nerve head, retinal nerve fiber layer, rim of the disc, the size of the disc, the volume of the cup.",

The combination of RNFL parameters only or both ONH and RNFL parameters provided the best classification results.
