The model considers macroeconomic and real estate time series variables as inputs and employs a Kalman filter to obtain an estimated fundamental price using demand and supply for Chinese real estate. We then measure the deviation between actual and estimated fundamental real estate prices to test for the existence of a bubble. We find evidence for the existence of a bubble especially post 2010, when the deviation ratio is found to be significantly higher with a peak of 80% in 2012. Our estimation of overvaluation is generally much higher than in other studies.",

The Chinese real estate market has experienced rapid price rises particularly during the period end 2000 to end 2015 when the national house price index rose by 332%; with house price rises being driven by the strong growth and rapid urbanization of the Chinese economy, as well as lack of alternative investment opportunities. According to Bordo and Jeanne (2002) property booms and busts have been a fairly frequent occurrence in the global economy topic as compared to stock market booms and busts.",

There are many ways in which to measure the existence of property bubbles, including using price to average income, price to rent and rental yield compared to the cost of mortgages. In this paper, we take a less direct approach and we regard the market value of a property as a state output variable changing over time; we similarly regard the economic factors determining the fundamental real estate price as changing inputs.",

The variables that cannot be observed are referred to as state variables. A linear state space model is typically composed of two equations, a state equation and a signal equation. The state equation can be used to represent the relation between observable and unobservable variables, while the signal equation describes the trends of unobservable variables. In our case, the extent of overvaluations is an unobservable variable and we therefore use the state space model to avoid the issue of inappropriate model specification in order to predict the extent of the deviation between market prices and fundamentals in the Chinese real estate sector.",

Prior to 1980 urban housing in China was basically either owned by work units of State Owned Enterprises (SEOs) or housing management departments of local governments. Residential housing was allocated to SEOs or housing management departments which in turn rented it to employees at very low rents with the State retaining the ownership of property. The central government played a significant role in determining the amount of housing investment and its allocation. The development of a private market in real estate in China began with reforms that were started in 1980 when the Chinese government implemented a variety of housing market commercialization policies. Those culminated in the 1988 central government document BImplementation Plan for a Gradual Housing System Reform in Cities and Towns^, which marked the beginning of a major programme of nationwide housing reform. The reforms permitted public housing units to be sold to their existing tenants at substantially discounted prices. In addition, there was also a programme to raise the rents towards more market oriented levels, which had limited success as the new rents were often still insufficient to cover the maintenance.",

On the demand side, a dual housing finance system was established using a combination of social savings and private savings.

It also encouraged the private sector to step into housebuilding and banks to lend to consumers with the object to create a proper functioning private market for housing. Over the period 1998-2002 there were a number of measures taken to stimulate the private housing market in China, including reductions in personal income tax, sales taxes and mortgage rates set at levels aimed at stimulating housing demand.

Bourassa et al. (2001) use selected fundamental variables such as real income (employment and the real wage rate), real construction costs, and the real after-tax interest rate as key determinants of supply and demand when looking for house price bubbles in three major cities in New Zealand. Liang and Cao (2007) and Chen and Zhu (2008) identify rapid GDP growth, bank lending and the rapid urbanization of China, as people move from rural locations to the Cities, as key drivers of the demand side in China. Another important factor on the demand side is economic agents' expectations relating to future prices, with expectations of price rises or falls influencing the decision of whether to buy or sell. Prices can also be influenced by government policies such as the building of roads, transport links to other cities, schools, hospitals, greenspace and planning permission. Governments can also heavily influence housing demand through changes in taxes on income and property and through the amount of land that can be used for housing stock which affects both the demand and supply and hence the equilibrium price. Ahuja et al. (2010) note that central government and local government fiscal relations, land development policies and land prices are key determinants of the supply of housing in China. According to Lai (2017) using a user cost approach framework, a combination of high income growth, rapid credit expansion and low interest rates lies behind the rapid rise in prices in the Chinese housing market with demand persistently outstripping supply. The basic argument behind the user cost approach is that Chinese citizens have a choice between saving money at low interest rates or buying housing stock with a prospective higher rental yield and capital appreciation and this is the main explanation of the imbalance in the Chinese property market.",

Leamer argues that using large deviations of price to rental ratios from their historical norms can be a useful method of detecting housing bubbles. In their study, Bj\u00f6rklund and S\u00f6derberg (1999) look at Swedish house prices over the period 1985 to 1994. They argue that a fundamental determinant of house prices is the Gross Income Multiplier (GIM). Their study finds that the ratio of house prices to rental income was too high and conclude that a bubble existed in the Swedish market. Ortalo-Magne and Rady (2006) use a life-cycle model of the housing market combined with a property market ladder to show that the income of young households is a prime determinant of their ability to afford a down-payment on a starter home. They show that, in such circumstances, changes in income may yield a housing price over-reaction with the house prices of trade-up homes exhibiting the most volatility. Their model also finds some empirical support when applied to the UK and US housing markets.",

In a market with real estate prices rising, banks lend more loans for property purchases as rises in real estate prices increase the value of bank capital to the extent that banks own real estate. Banks may then perceive that there is a lower risk of real estate lending. As such, an increase in real estate prices can increase the amount of banking loan exposure to the real estate sector which in turn leads to further rises in real estate prices. Once prices of real estate peak, a fall in the price of real estate will lower the value of the banking sectors real estate assets and the value of loans collateralized by real estate. There may also be defaults, which further depletes banks capital, increasing the perceived riskiness of the real estate sector and in turn reduces the supply of credit to the real estate industry leading to further falls in prices and further reductions in loans to the real estate sector. Regulators may intervene to the weakening of bank capital positions by increasing capital requirements and instituting stricter rules for classifying and provisioning against real estate assets ultimately leading to even less activity in the real estate sector and lower prices.",

            "text": "Studies on the Chinese property market have grown in recent years. Liang and Cao (2007) investigate the relationship between property prices and bank lending for the case of China over the period 1999-2006, and find that there is unidirectional causality running from bank lending to property prices. Zhang et al. (2012) show that Chinese house prices can also be linked to changes in the macroeconomic variables using a nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs approach combined with the vector error correction model over the period 1999-2010. Their estimations show that the mortgage rate, money supply growth rate, producer prices and the real exchange rate are key drivers of Chinese house prices while surprisingly they do not detect a significant role for personal disposable income, international trade or real incomes. Guo and Huang (2010) show that hot money from abroad has been a significant driver of the Chinese stock and property prices. While Liu and Wray (2010) argue that the liquidity driving the property prices in China is the result of massive intervention in the foreign exchange market by the Peoples Bank of China as reflected in the large increase in Chinese foreign exchange reserves. The increase in the Renminbi money supply resulting from the intervention means artificially low interest rates and high money supply and credit growth. Dreger and Zhang (2013) argue that that there was a large rise in the real estate market as a direct result of the fiscal stimulus package unleashed by the Chinese authorities as a result of the global financial crisis and also the very loose money market conditions permitted by the Chinese monetary authorities. Using a dataset covering some 35 major Chinese cities over the period 1998 to 2009, the authors apply a panel model along with cointegration techniques and find that Chinese real estate was some 25% higher than the equilibrium value implied by the fundamentals at the end of 2009, with the overpricing especially high in cities in southeast coastal areas and special economic zones. Xu and Chen (2012) also argue that Chinese monetary policy actions are the key driver of real estate price growth in in China over the period 1998 to 2009. They examine the impact of monetary policy variables which includes the money supply growth rate, the long term bank loan rate and a mortgage credit policy indicator to analyse real estate price growth dynamics in China. Their empirical results show a two way causal connection, with a lower interest rate, higher money supply growth rate and a loosening of mortgage down payment requirements leading to rapid price rises for real estate. This then leads to even more loans to the sector and a further loosening of credit standards. Du et al. (2011) look at the connection between Chinese land policy and its impact on the dynamic relationship between the house prices and land prices in the Chinese real estate market. Using panel data sets for Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing they demonstrate that there exists a long-run equilibrium between Chinese urban housing and land markets. Wu et al. (2012) show that price to rent ratios have risen substantially over time in China being over 40 in some cities. They also show that rises in land prices has been a major force in driving up real estate prices in China with land prices rising over 800% between 2003 and 2010. This has created bubble like conditions in certain Chinese cities.",

In many applications, the driving forces behind the evolution of economic variables are (at least partially) not observable or measurable. For example, at an individual level a person's income may depend on their intelligence, special abilities, social skills, and so on. Similarly, at an aggregate level, economic theory suggests that macroeconomic variables such as economic growth are driven by unobservable factors, e.g. technological change or human capital accumulation. For this reason, SSMs have been applied in the econometrics literature to model unobserved variables such as; expectations, measurement errors, missing observations, permanent income, unobserved components (cycles and trends) and the non-accelerating rate of unemployment. Extensive surveys of applications of state space models in econometrics can be found in Hamilton (1994a, Chapter 13) and Harvey et al. (2004).",

While linear regression models use exogenous variables to distinguish the explained variation from the unexplained variation, a SSM relies on the dynamics of the state variables and the linkage between the observed variables and state variables to draw statistical inference about the unobserved states. In this respect, a SSM can represent an improvement also upon VAR techniques. Comparing SSM to standard VAR models when explanatory variables are not observable, standard VAR models can no longer be applied to study the evolution of the endogenous variables. However, it is easy to extend the VAR framework to analyse scenarios with unobservable explanatory variables by using SSM. In fact, a wide range of time series models, including the classical linear regression model and ARIMA models, can be written and estimated as special cases of a state space specification.",

This feature is important because real estate markets can be characterized by a fundamental mismatch between supply and demand which can take time to correct and by a component of demand that is investment driven and that is typically not decreasing in price. 1 A fair account of the bubble component should therefore exclude those components. Moreover, in our analysis we do not consider rents on purpose, because those are codetermined in the economy with the observable market prices, whereas we want to have a measure of the fundamental unobservable real estate price that depends as much as possible on fundamental macro-economic factors.",

Those policies have changed frequently, in an attempt to effectively control the market with objectives of promoting growth and stability. We can now analyze the dynamics of the deviation ratio with respect to the policy changes. There are various interesting features of the deviation ratio that are worth noticing in Fig. 1. First, we observe that the deviation ratio seems to have a cyclical behaviour over one calendar year; this behaviour, which is common to many western economies, can be explained by the fact that more properties tend to come on the market in the spring-summer period.",

The introduction of those policies in 2005 marks an important shift from the previous 2001-2004 period when State Council policies had as primary objective to sustain and promote the real estate market (see Li 2016). In particular, in a market  increased the minimum down payment ratio for homebuyers from 20% to 30%. We notice that the deviation ratio decreases from 35% in mid-2005 to 5% at the end of 2006, showing that the effect of the price-stabilizing policies while not immediate are quite powerful. Next we notice that despite the cyclical behaviour, the deviation ratio in 2007 is much lower than in the previous years. Li and Chiang (2012) explain that from March 2007 to August 2008, the PBOC increased the residential loan rates 6 times and the deposit reserve ratio 13 times. These were extreme measures that the PBOC had never adopted before. Moreover, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development increased the Housing Provident Fund (HPF) loan rates 6 times in a row. 2 Researchers have commented that those policies may have a distortive impact and unintended consequences. Moreover, the suppression on the bubble in the real estate market does not last long as the deviation ratio still reaches 30% in 2007, signalling that the real estate market is overheated and is little impacted by the by the monetary policy in short term.",

To avoid an economic recession, a series of new policies were formulated by the PBOC in October 2010. In particular, from October 27th the central bank decided to adjust the lower bound of the personal loan interest rate to 0.7 times the benchmark interest rate and revert the down payment portion back to 20%. There were five issuance of Notice on Lowering the RMB Benchmark Interest Rates for Loans and Deposit Reserve Rate of Financial Institutions. For low-cost housing, affordable housing and housing rental, policies provided tax free land for developers according to a defined portion of the total space. This welfare policy aimed at protecting the rigid demand of inhabitants while the loan interest and the subsidy are both unfavorable in this period. We notice that the trend of the deviation ratio is different in 2008 with respect to other years, as it reaches its bottom, rather than a peak, in the second quarter. In this period, due to the global economic recession, investors and speculators had less funds and confidence even in China, despite the still booming property market. Despite the global recession in 2008, the real estate market in China remains quite stable throughout 2009 mainly due to the effects of the favourable policies.",

The behaviour is still cyclical but the average ratio from 2010 to 2014 is 35%, whereas it is 15% in the preceding sub-sample. Moreover, the magnitude of volatility is also higher after 2010. It can therefore be noticed that the real estate market of China recovers quickly from the recession but after the stimulating policy intervention sale prices rise quickly and significantly shift away from the estimated fundamental value. For this reason, April 2010 marks the start of a new set of policy measures aimed at restricting purchases and loans with the objective of limiting real estate appreciation and to keep the market stable. On 30 April 2010, the State Council issued the restrictive purchase policy (xiangou) to cool down the overheated property market. Restrictive purchases set purchase limits on the number of flats that could be sold to households. In 40 major cities, residents with local hukou (i.e., household registration) can buy up to two flats, nonlocal residents or foreigners can only buy one flat, and the interval for buying a second flat must be at least 2 years. Moreover, to control construction targets in an attempt to stabilize the market expectations, the central government required regional governments to issue property price controls in 2011 and by March 2011 608 cities in China issued policies to control real estate prices according to the Construction Department Database. Li (2016) comments that after the Chinese government implemented the restrictive purchase policy, none of the cities had any signs of housing bubbles in 2010/11. However, eight cities had bubbles detected in 2011/12 and most cities have shown signs of bubbles since 2012. We notice that despite the restrictive policies from 2011 to 2013, the deviation ratio peaks at 80% at the beginning of 2012 and stays at an average in excess of 40% thereafter.",

By estimating the real estate demand and supply with a SSM using a broad number of macroeconomic and financial factors, we have been able to isolate the non-fundamental price component. We have then compared the market price to the fundamental price to calculate a deviation ratio, which is our measure of the extent of the bubble in the Chinese real estate market. Using the deviation ratio, we have described how the bubble component changes over time and we attempt to highlight how the deviation responds to changes in relation to policies of the Chinese authorities.",

Compared to previous approaches in the literature, the novel contribution of our methodology is that the deviation ratio measures a purely bubble component. In other words, our bubble component does not include price changes that are due to nonequilibrium between supply and demand, where demand includes not only the users' market but also investors' demand. This feature is important because real estate markets are characterized by a fundamental mismatch between supply and demand, due to the time to develop property, and by a component of demand that is investment driven and that is typically not decreasing in price and a fair account of the bubble component should not include those components.",

In line with Li (2016) we find evidence that interest rate policies or restricted housing purchase policies in specific cities post 2011 did not limit the bubble component at the aggregate national level. Given this evidence, we attribute a fundamental role in the inefficacy of interest rate policies to the role played by shadow banking. As the recent literature shows that bank lending is increasingly independent from the PBOC, it remains an open question whether shadow banking lending supports, weakens, or amplifies the effects of monetary policy. Gabrieli, Pilbeam and Shi (2018 forthcoming) contribute to this recent debate by showing that Chinese Shadow Banking works independently from official monetary policy: it amplifies increases in the money supply but weakens the effects of restrictive interest rate-based monetary policy decisions. Given that virtually all of the official interest rate changes in the last decade have been motivated by policy objectives focussed on the real estate market, we conclude that the inability to curb the real estate bubble is very much related to the opposing role played by Shadow Banking. Future research could take a further step and specifically investigate the role of shadow banking in real estate price dynamics in China.",
