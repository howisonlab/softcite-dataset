            "text": "Background and objectives: One of the greatest challenges of health care systems at the dawn of the 21st century is tuberculosis (TB). Drug resistant strains of TB are becoming a global public health risk. These strains commonly appear due to faulty therapies. Patients frequently stop treatment due to the toxicity of anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) drugs. Amla (Emblica officinalis) is a well-known Unani single drug. Jawarish amla is a Unani compound formulation which is commonly used to administer amla. This study tested the efficacy of Jawarish amla as an adjuvant to ATT drugs in reducing their side effects. Methodology: Half of forty eligible pulmonary tuberculosis patients were randomly assigned to Test (Group B) and the other half to Control (Group A). Six grams of Jawarish amla twice daily was administered to the test group, and the same dosage of placebo was administered to control group along with directly observed treatment, short course chemotherapy (DOTS) for 60 days. Fisher exact test and paired t-test were applied for efficacy evaluation. Grading of symptoms was done to assess the toxicity of ATT and outcome of the adjuvant. Results and discussion: Significant improvements were observed in almost all subjective and objective parameters. The exceptions were serum creatine and serum uric acid, which showed nonsignificant slight elevations within normal limits. Conclusion: Jawarish amla was ascertained to be safe and effective adjuvant of DOTS in combating the adverse effects of ATT drugs.",

Jawarish amla as an adjuvant therapy may increase the efficiency of DOTS therapy, reduce the number of drug resistance cases and side effects as well as reverse the consequences and rejuvenate body power. A recent study of Jawarish amla \"showed potential to provide protection against toxic effects of cyclophosphamide in tumour bearing mice.\" 7 Thus a study using Jawarish amla, an Unani adjuvant compound formulation, has been undertaken to evaluate its efficacy in combating the side effects of ATT drugs, reversing the adverse consequences of DOTS therapy, boosting general immunity and facilitating a complete recovery from TB.

TB has been a major communicable tragedy for centuries and is the prime cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). 1,2,3 It is estimated that 2.5 million people are infected with HIV in India. Considering 40% of the total population of India is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an estimated 1 million persons are co-infected with TB and HIV. HIV is the most powerful risk factor for the progression of TB infection to TB disease. It is also the leading cause of death in People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA).",
