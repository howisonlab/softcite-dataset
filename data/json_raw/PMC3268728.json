            "text": "Ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) belongs to a family of proteins with two kinase domains. Following activation in the cytoplasm by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), it mediates the cell-proliferative, cell-growth, and survival-promoting actions of a number of growth factors and other agonists. These diverse biological actions of RSK1 involve regulation of both cytoplasmic and nuclear events. However, the mechanisms that permit nuclear accumulation of RSK1 remain unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylation of RSK1 on S221 is important for its dissociation from the type I\u03b1 regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) in the cytoplasm and that RSK1 contains a bipartite nuclear localization sequence that is necessary for its nuclear entry. Once inside, the active RSK1 is retained in the nucleus via its interactions with PKA catalytic subunit and AKAP95. Mutations of RSK1 that do not affect its activity but disrupt its entry into the nucleus or expression of AKAP95 forms that do not enter the nucleus inhibit the ability of active RSK1 to stimulate DNA synthesis. Our findings identify novel mechanisms by which active RSK1 accumulates in the nucleus and also provide new insights into how AKAP95 orchestrates cell cycle progression."

Among the four isoforms of RSKs that are products of different genes, RSK1, RSK2, and RSK3 share significant sequence similarity; RSK4 is longer than the other isoforms and may also be functionally different (Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999;Dummler et al., 2005;Anjum and Blenis, 2008). Despite their similarity, RSK1, RSK2, and RSK3 are not functionally redundant. Thus, although RSK1 and RSK3 show normal overlapping expression patterns with RSK2 in brains of patients with Coffin-Lowry syndrome, in which RSK2 is mutated, the functions of the mutant RSK2 are not replaced by the other isoforms (Jacquot et al., 1998). Likewise, whereas RSK1 can differentiate PC12 cells, RSK2 is not effective (Silverman et al., 2004), and RSK1, but not the other isoforms, regulates lung cancer cell motility and metastasis (Lara et al., 2011).",

In keeping with their role as positive modulators of cell proliferation and growth, RSK1 and RSK2 levels are elevated in ductal and lobular human breast cancer tissues, as well as in 50% of prostate tumors, and inhibition of RSK1 and RSK2 activities results in decreased cell growth (Clark et al., 2005;Smith et al., 2005). RSK1 also plays a profound role in neuronal differentiation, as demonstrated by the finding that constitutively active RSK1 is sufficient to elicit neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (Silverman et al., 2004). This observation also suggests that the prolonged ERK1/2 activation that is necessary for PC12 cell differentiation (Vaudry et al., 2002) is mediated by activating the downstream kinase RSK1. The role of RSK1 in promoting cell survival has been demonstrated using dominant-negative forms",

Following docking onto RSK1, ERK1/2 phosphorylates T573 in the activation loop of the C-terminal kinase (CTK), as well as T359 and S363 in the linker region that joins the N-terminal kinase (NTK) and CTK (Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999). Phosphorylation of T573 activates the CTK, and this domain can then phosphorylate S380 in the linker region (Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999).

            "text": "in Figure 1B (top two rows), in the absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF), endogenous RSK1, detected by the anti-RSK1 antibody, was localized mainly in the cytoplasm, with very little being present in the nucleus. However, after EGF treatment, considerable increase in the nuclear localization of the endogenous RSK1 was observed ( Figure 1B, top two rows). Similarly, use of anti-phospho-Thr-573 antibody showed that there is very little active phospho-Thr-573 RSK1 in serum-starved HeLa cells ( Figure 1B, third row). On stimulation with EGF, the endogenous phospho-RSK1 in HeLa cells was localized mainly in the nucleus, as reported before (Richards et al., 2001), and exposure of cells to the PDK1 inhibitor BX795 decreased the EGF-mediated nuclear localization of RSK1 ( Figure 1B, bottom three rows). Of note, the PDK1 inhibitor did not affect RSK1 phosphorylation in the activation loop (Thr-573) of the C-terminal kinase, the linker region (Thr-359/Ser-363), and Ser-380, which forms the PDK1-binding site ( Figure 1C). However, consistent with its role as PDK1 inhibitor, BX795 inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser-221 (the PDK1 site) and Ser-732, the site on RSK1 that is autophosphorylated by its NTK (Roux et al., 2003;Figure 1C). These data suggest that Ser-221 phosphorylation is necessary for nuclear localization of RSK1. To more carefully examine the role of Ser-221 in nuclear localization of RSK1, we expressed hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wildtype RSK1 and HA-RSK1 harboring substitutions of Ser-221 with either Ala (S221A), which cannot be phosphorylated, or Asp (S221D) to mimic phosphorylation at this site. As shown in Figure 2, A and B, upon EGF treatment of HeLa cells, the wild-type RSK1 localized to the nucleus. However, EGF did not enhance nuclear accumulation of the S221A mutant of RSK1. On the other hand, like its wild-type counterpart, the S221D form of RSK1 was localized to the nucleus after EGF treatment of HeLa cells ( Figure 2, A and B). Consistent with the role of S221 phosphorylation in the activation of RSK1, in in vitro kinase assays, the S221A form of RSK1 was inactive and did not exhibit any kinase activity ( Figure 2C). In contrast, the S221D form of RSK1 was activated upon EGF addition but was not active without EGF treatment of HeLa cells ( Figure 2C). This is consistent with the findings that in addition to phosphorylation of S221 (or a negative charge at this position) in the NTK, the phosphorylation of other sites in the linker region on RSK1 is necessary for activation of the NTK (Dalby et al., 1998;Gross et al., 2001). Of note, by immunocytochemistry, the active endogenous RSK1 (detected FIGuRE 2: Phosphorylation of RSK1 on S221 dissociates it from PKARI\u03b1 to permit its nuclear translocation. (A, B) Wild-type and S221D mutant, but not the S221A form, of RSK1 translocate to nuclei after EGF treatment as shown by immunocytochemistry (A) and cellular fractionation (B). HeLa cells were transfected to express HA-RSK1 or its mutants. After serum starvation, cells were treated with or without 100 nM EGF for 10 min. The HA-RSK1 localization was monitored with anti-HA antibody (A). In B, the amounts of HA-RSK1 or its mutants in cytosolic fraction (C) or nuclear fraction (N) were analyzed by Western blotting. PLC\u03b3, cytosol marker; histone 1, nuclear marker. (C) Kinase activities of HA-RSK1 or its mutants. HA-tagged wild-type and its mutant RSK1 forms were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody from HeLa cells treated with or without EGF for 10 min and then were subjected to the in vitro kinase assays. (D) Cell-permeable peptide PS, corresponding to the pseudosubstrate region of PKARI\u03b1, dissociates wildtype and S221A mutant of RSK1 from their association with PKARI\u03b1. Serum-starved HeLa cells were preincubated with or without 2 \u03bcM peptide PS for 10 min and then treated with or without EGF for 10 min. PKARI\u03b1 in the lysates was pulled down with cAMP-agarose, and presence of HA-RSK1 or its mutant was monitored. (E) Peptide PS allows RSK1 S221A to translocate to the nuclei in the presence of EGF. HeLa cells were treated as in D. HA-RSK1 localization was monitored with anti-HA antibody. All data presented are representatives from three independent experiments. Values in B and C are the mean \u00b1 SE (n = 3). Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test analyses.

For this purpose, we used the recently described cell-permeable peptide Bimax1 (sequence, RRRRPRKRPLEWDEEP-PRKRKRLW), which binds with importin \u03b1 and inhibits nuclear localization of proteins via an importin \u03b1/\u03b2-mediated pathway (Kosugi et al., 2008). Pretreatment of HeLa cells with Bimax1 for 20 min abrogated the nuclear localization of RSK1 ( Figure 3A). The lack of endogenous RSK1 localization to the nucleus in the presence of Bimax1 was not due to changes in the ability of EGF to phosphorylate RSK1 on its various sites and activate it ( Figure 3B). These data suggested that nuclear localization of RSK1 requires importin \u03b1/\u03b2-mediated nuclear transport.",

            "text": "Importin \u03b1/\u03b2-mediated transport of proteins requires a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). A close examination of the RSK1 sequence revealed the presence of a 17-residue-long \"putative\" bipartite NLS (K 316 RHIFYSTIDWNKLYRR 332 ) at the interface of the NTK and linker region on RSK1 ( Figure 4A). Because the basic residues on the N-and C-termini of the bipartite NLS are functionally important, we made substitutions of the N-terminal basic residues K316/R317 with Ala (NM) or the C-terminal basic residues K328/ R331/R332 with Ala (CM), as well as substitutions of all basic residues in both the N-and C-terminals in the \"putative\" NLS with Ala (NM/CM; Figure 4A). In response to EGF treatment of cells, the phosphorylation of T573, T359/S363, or S380 on the various mutant forms of RSK1 was not altered ( Figure 4B). However, the NM/CM form of RSK1 was not phosphorylated on S221 ( Figure 4B). Consistent with the requirement for S221 phosphorylation being important for activation of RSK1, the NM/CM form of RSK1 that was immunoprecipitated from cells treated with EGF did not exhibit elevation in kinase activity ( Figure 4C). On the other hand, although the NM mutant of RSK1 was phosphorylated on S221, it was devoid of kinase activity ( Figure 4C), suggesting that the substitution of K316/ R317 with Ala in the extreme C-terminus of NTK ( Figure 4A) disrupted the structure of this kinase domain, rendering it inactive. The kinase activity of the CM mutant of RSK1 was enhanced by EGF treatment ( Figure 4C). Another interesting finding in these experiments is the observation that EGF increased phosphorylation of S732 on the NM/CM mutant of RSK1 that is not phosphorylated on S221 and is also not activated by the growth factor ( Figure 4, B and C). This suggests that phosphorylation of S732 on RSK1 can occur in-trans and, in the case of the NM/CM RSK1, possibly via activation by EGF of the endogenous RSK1.",

This is because the amount of active RSK1 is only a fraction of the total RSK1 and its translocation to the nucleus creates a higher concentration in the nucleus than the larger cytoplasmic compartment. Because of this concentration difference, it is difficult to clearly see the cytoplasmic active RSK1 by immunocytochemistry with anti-phospho-T573 antibody.

Thus it is possible that phosphorylation of Ser-221 on RSK1 is required to release the enzyme from its interactions with PKARI\u03b1 in the cytoplasm to then permit its entry into the nucleus. To address this possibility, we took advantage of our previously published findings that a cell-permeable, palmitoylated peptide corresponding to the pseudosubstrate region of PKARI\u03b1 (peptide PS) dissociates it from RSK1 (Gao et al., 2010). Essentially, we determined whether the cell permeable peptide PS that interferes with RSK1/ PKARI\u03b1 interactions dissociates the S221A form of RSK1 from PKARI\u03b1 and permits its entry into the nucleus. As shown in Figure 2D, preincubation of HeLa cells with peptide PS decreased the association of RSK1 with both wild-type and S221A forms of RSK1. Moreover, whereas EGF treatment of cells did not result in nuclear localization of S221A RSK1, pretreatment of cells expressing this form of RSK1 with peptide PS permitted its nuclear localization upon EGF addition ( Figure 2E). Collectively, the data in Figure 2 demonstrate that phos-FIGuRE 3: Nuclear translocation of RSK1 requires importin-mediated transport.

The findings in Figure 4D were also confirmed by monitoring the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of HeLa cells expressing either the wild-type or the NLS mutant forms of RSK1 ( Figure 4E). The inability of the CM mutant of RSK1 to localize to the nucleus in response to EGF is not due to the lack of either its kinase activity or its phosphorylation on S221 ( Figure 4, B and C), strongly suggesting that neither the phosphorylation of S221 nor kinase activity of RSK1 by itself is sufficient for nuclear localization. Moreover, these data ( Figure 4, D and E) strongly suggest that residues K328/R331/R332 form part of the NLS on RSK1.",

            "text": "We previously showed that active RSK1 interacts with PKAc, which binds to its regulatory subunit PKARI\u03b1, which in turn associates with AKAPs, and that disruption of the indirect (via PKA subunit) interaction of RSK1 with AKAPs by different approaches disrupts the nuclear localization of active RSK1 (Chaturvedi et al., 2006(Chaturvedi et al., , 2009Gao et al., 2010). Therefore we asked whether, once localized to the nucleus, RSK1 requires its indirect interactions with AKAPs to be retained in the nucleus. To address this question, we first treated HeLa cells with EGF for 10 min and then added stearated-Ht31, a cellpermeable peptide that disrupts the interactions of PKA regulatory subunits with AKAPs (Carr et al., 1991;Vijayaraghavan et al., 1997). At different times thereafter, we examined the localization of the endogenous active RSK1 in HeLa cells. As shown in Figure 5A (right panel), EGF treatment resulted in the nuclear localization of RSK1 over the time span (20 min) of the experiment. However, when Ht31 was added after pretreatment with EGF, the amount of the nuclear RSK1 decreased over time, such that 5 min after Ht31 addition, the amount of active RSK1 in the cytoplasm was markedly increased. These data ( Figure 5A) show that the retention of the active RSK1 in the nucleus requires its association in a complex with AKAP(s). Of interest, exposure of HeLa cells to the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) abolished the Ht31-mediated decrease in nuclear accumulation of active RSK1 ( Figure 5B), suggesting that RSK1 may also contain a nuclear export sequence (see Discussion). The data in Figure 5B also confirm that the loss of active RSK1 in the nucleus after Ht31 treatment was due to efflux of RSK1 from the nucleus.",

            "text": "To identify the AKAP(s) that retain active RSK1 in the nucleus, we treated B82L cells with cell-permeable, stearated Ht31 or control Ht31P that does not dissociate PKA regulatory subunits from AKAPs (Carr et al., 1991;Vijayaraghavan et al., 1997) for 20 min and then treated cells with EGF for 10 min. Following immunoprecipitation of RSK1, we analyzed the associated proteins by SDS-PAGE and gel code blue staining. Ht31 decreased a few protein bands associated with RSK1 (Supplemental Figure S1A). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer analyses of the \u223c100-kDa band in control and Ht31P yielded peptides corresponding to several proteins, including AKAP95 (Supplemental Figure S1B). AKAP95 was shown to be a nuclear protein (Coghlan et al., 1994;Eide et al., 1998;Akileswaran et al., 2001). Therefore we investigated whether RSK1 and AKAP95 existed in the same complex. As shown in Figure  6A, immunoprecipitation of AKAP95 from HeLa cells treated with EGF resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of RSK1. In controls with NIH3T3 cells that do not express endogenous RSK1 but do express RSK2 and RSK3 (Supplemental Figure S2), this interaction was not observed ( Figure 6A). Of note, silencing of AKAP95 did not alter the ability of EGF to activate RSK1 in HeLa cells ( Figure 6B). Moreover, as assessed by cell fractionation and fluorescence microscopy, silencing of AKAP95 in HeLa cells, respectively, resulted in a decrease in the nuclear content of active RSK1 and increase in its cytosolic amounts ( Figure 6, C and D). Similar results (not shown) were also found in B82L mouse lung fibroblasts, in which RSK1 interacts with PKA subunits as shown here with HeLa cells (Chaturvedi et al., 2006(Chaturvedi et al., , 2009Gao et al., 2010). Thus the inability of phospho-RSK1 to localize to the nucleus is not due to altered RSK1 activation. Together these data suggest that AKAP95 is one of the AKAPs that retain active RSK1 in the nucleus.",

            "text": "To further confirm the notion that AKAP95 retains active RSK1 in the nucleus, we expressed either the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type AKAP95 or its mutant forms that contain substitutions of one (1M; R290S), two (2M; K304S/R305S), or three (3M; R290S/K304S/R305S) residues in its NLS and, therefore, do not affect (1M), attenuate (2M), or abolish (3M) the nuclear localization of AKAP95 (Kamada et al., 2005). Consistent with the original report with these forms of AKAP95 (Kamada et al., 2005), as monitored by immunocytochemistry in HEK293 cells, the wild-type and 1M forms were mainly nuclear, the 2M form was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and the 3M mutant was cytoplasmic (Supplemental Figure S3, A-D). In addition, after expressing wildtype and mutant forms of GFP-AKAP95 in HEK 293 cells and treating them with EGF, we determined by cell fractionation studies the localization of the endogenous RSK1 in the nucleus and cytosolic fractions of the cells. As shown in Figure 7A, in the presence of EGF, more phospho-RSK1 was present in the nuclear fractions than in the cytosolic fractions from cells transfected with the wild-type and 1M mutant forms of AKAP95. The distribution of phospho-RSK1 was approximately similar in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions from cells transfected with GFP-AKAP95 2M and mostly cytosolic in cells expressing GFP-AKAP95 3M ( Figure 7A). Similarly, in HeLa cells, the expressed wild-type GFP-AKAP95 was localized to the nucleus together with active (phospo-380) RSK1, whereas expression of the 3M mutant of GFP-AKAP95 resulted in colocalization of the active RSK1 with the 3M mutant in the cytoplasm ( Figure 7B). These findings were also corroborated by immunolocalization of the wild-type AKAP95 or its 3M mutant and RSK1 ( Figure 7C). Of note, mutations of the NLS in AKAP95 did not alter its ability to be coimmunoprecipitated with RSK1 (Supplemental Figure S3E). Together, the data in Figure 7 demonstrate that active RSK1 interacts with AKAP95 in cells and the 3M mutant of AKAP95, which cannot be localized to the nucleus, sequesters active RSK1 in the cytoplasm. In this latter respect, the overexpressed 3M mutant of AKAP95 acts as a \"trap\" for RSK1 and precludes its localization into the nucleus.",

In the first approach, we investigated whether the nuclear function of the CM mutant form of RSK1 that is activated by EGF but does not localize to the nucleus (Figure 4) is different from its wild-type counterpart.

            "text": "Besides elucidating how active RSK1 is localized and retained in the nucleus, we unraveled some additional salient features concerning how this enzyme is regulated. First, as previously suggested (Gao et al., 2010), although the phosphorylation of Ser-221 is necessary for nuclear localization of RSK1, we demonstrated that this phos-phorylation is required to dissociate the active RSK1 from PKARI\u03b1 in the cytoplasm. Hence the S221A mutant of RSK1, which does not localize to the nucleus upon EGF treatment of cells, can localize to the nucleus if its interaction with PKARI\u03b1 is disrupted by low concentrations of a cell-permeable peptide (peptide PS) corresponding to the pseudosubstrate region of PKARI\u03b1, the inactive RSK1-binding site (Gao et al., 2010). At the low concentrations of peptide PS used in this study, PKAc and PKARI\u03b1 interactions are not affected (Gao et al., 2010). Because the S221A mutant of RSK1 is not active, our findings with peptide PS also demonstrate that the inactive RSK1 can enter the nucleus. However, because nuclear localization of the S221A mutant of RSK1 is EGF dependent, our findings suggest that the other sites on RSK1 have to be phosphorylated for its nuclear entry. Overall, therefore, although phosphorylation of S221 is required to release RSK1 from PKARI\u03b1 and permit its nuclear localization, the activity of the NTK is not necessary for its nuclear translocation. Second, supporting the notion that phosphorylation of sites in the linker region of RSK1 are necessary for its activity (Dalby et al., 1998;Gross et al., 2001), we showed that the S221D mutant of RSK1 also requires EGF for activation of the NTK and that a negative 2007), are important for activity, and their substitution perhaps alters the conformation of the NTK to abrogate its activity.",

            "text": "We also demonstrated that RSK1 contains a bipartite NLS, and substitution of basic residues in its N-or C-terminus abrogates its translocation to the nucleus after EGF addition. Because substitution of both the Nterminal (K316/R317) and C-terminal (K328/ R331/R332) basic residues in the NLS with Ala (RSK1-NM/CM) also disrupts its phosphorylation on S221, this form of RSK1 most likely does not translocate to the nucleus because it cannot dissociate from PKARI\u03b1. However, substitutions of basic residues in only the N-terminal (K316/R317, RSK1-NM) or C-terminal (K328/R331/R332, RSK1-CM) regions of the NLS that permit the phosphorylation of S221 on these mutant forms also do not translocate to the nucleus irrespective of whether the activity of the NTK can be augmented by EGF (RSK1-CM) or not (RSK1-NM). These findings, coupled with the observations that phosphorylation of S221 or a negative charge at this position, but not the activity of the NTK, is required for nuclear translocation of RSK1 demonstrate that the 17-residue-long region comprising K316-R332 is the NLS. This region is encompassed by the \u03b1I-\u03b1J loop as well as the \u03b1J helix at the surface of the large helical lobe of the NTK (Ikuta et al., 2007) and is conserved in RSK1 in different species such as mouse, rat, and human. In addition, cognate regions comprising residues K313-K329 and K322-R338 on RSK2 and RSK3, respectively, also have significant similarity to the NLS on RSK1. Thus it is possible that these regions on RSK2 and RSK3 are also their respective NLSs. However, in one study, the expression of the N-terminal half of RSK2, which included residues K313-K329, did not localize to the nucleus, and that study suggested that the C-terminal half of RSK2 is important for its nuclear localization (Eisinger-Mathason et al., 2008), raising the possibility that the NLS containing K313-329 is functional in the context of the full-length RSK2 when the autophosphorylation sites on the linker region are phosphorylated.",

            "text": "We previously showed that the active RSK1 via its extreme C-terminal 13 residues, which include Ser-732, associates with PKAc, and this interaction requires the phosphorylation of Ser-732 (Gao and Patel, 2009). This interaction permits the indirect (via the regulatory subunit of PKA) association of the active RSK1 with AKAPs, and disruption of the RSK/PKA complex from AKAPs results in decreased nuclear localization of RSK1. The decreased nuclear localization could result from either export of the RSK1 from the nucleus or the lack of RSK1 entry into the nucleus. Here we showed that charge at this position by itself is not sufficient to activate the enzyme. A third interesting aspect is that the substitution of K316/ R317 with Ala abrogated the activity of the NTK without altering its phosphorylation on Ser-221. Thus these two basic residues in the extreme C-terminus of the NTK, which lie on its surface (Ikuta et al., FIGuRE 8: Nuclear translocation of RSK1 is required to stimulate DNA synthesis.

(B) HA-RSK1, but not its CM mutant, stimulate BrdU incorporation. NIH3T3 cells were transfected to express HA-RSK1 or HA-RSK1 CM. After serum starvation, cells were incubated with 10% serum/DMEM for 18 h, followed by the addition of BrdU for 4 h. (C) Overexpression of GFP-AKAP95 3M, but not wild-type GFP-AKAP95, decreases BrdU incorporation in HeLa cells. After transfection to express wild-type GFP-AKAP95 or its 3M mutant in HeLa cells, experiments were performed as in B. The quantified data in B and C reflect the number of BrdU-positive cells as a ratio of the total number of cells that expressed the different transfected constructs. The BrdU-positive staining in untransfected cells within the same fields provided the control ratios. The data are mean \u00b1 SE from at least 102 cells from four separate experiments (B) and at least 181 cells from three experiments (C). Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test analyses. Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm.",

Because leptomycin B blocked the Ht31-mediated efflux of RSK1 from the nucleus ( Figure 5B), it is possible that RSK1 contains a nuclear export signal. However, a nuclear export signal for RSK1 has not been identified. From its primary structure, it appears that residues Leu-173 to Ser-180 on RSK1 qualify as a putative nuclear export sequence. These residues in the \u03b1E helix are adjacent to the NLS on the surface of the large helical loop of the NTK on RSK1 (Ikuta et al., 2007). Because substitutions of K316 and R317 that are adjacent to the putative nuclear export signal (L173-S180) on the surface of the NTK disrupt its activity, we have not endeavored to mutate the putative RSK1 nuclear export signal.",

These data are consistent with the role of RSK1 as a promoter of cell proliferation (Smith et al., 2005) and also demonstrate that the NLS mutant of RSK1 loses its nuclear function. Similarly, overexpression of GFP-AKAP 3M, which traps endogenous RSK1 in the cytoplasm, also diminished incorporation of BrdU, further demonstrating the necessity for nuclear RSK1 in this process. Overall, our findings demonstrate that RSK1 contains an NLS (K316-R332) that is necessary for its import into the nucleus and that phosphorylation of Ser-221 in the NTK is required to dissociate it from PKARI\u03b1/AKAP complex in the cytoplasm. The activation of the NTK is not necessary for nuclear translocation of RSK1, and besides S221, other phospho sites on RSK1 are also important for both its activity and nuclear import. Once inside the nucleus, RSK1 requires indirect (via PKA) interactions with AKAP95 to be retained in the nucleus. Moreover, mutations of the NLS on RSK1 that do not affect its kinase activity but interfere with its nuclear localization or trapping of RSK1 in the cytoplasm by an NLS-deficient mutant of AKAP95 diminishes BrdU incorporation in cells.",

N-terminally once the active RSK1 is in the nucleus, the addition of Ht31, which disrupts PKA interactions with AKAPs, results in a time-dependent export of the active RSK1 from the nucleus. Hence the interaction of active RSK1 with PKAc and, therefore, AKAP(s) is necessary for its retention in the nucleus. The need for RSK1 interactions with PKA subunits and AKAP(s) for nuclear retention is akin to the nuclear retention of RSK2 via its interactions with TIA-1 (Eisinger-Mathason et al., 2008).",

Of interest, AKAP95 associates with the RII subunits of PKA (Herberg et al., 2000). Previously, we demonstrated that the inactive RSK1 interacts with RI but not RII subunits (unpublished data). However, since the active RSK1 interacts with PKAc, it is possible that in the nucleus the RSK1, via PKAc and PKARII, is tethered to AKAP95 (see schematic in Figure  9). This would be consistent with the notion that PKARI\u03b1 is cytosolic in its localization whereas nuclear PKARII is responsible for association of PKAc with nuclear AKAPs (Day et al., 2011). Also interesting are the previous findings that AKAP95 is important in G1 \u2192 S phase transition and is associated with proteins that regulate this process (Arsenijevic et al., 2004(Arsenijevic et al., , 2006. In addition, AKAP95 is involved in chromosome condensation at mitosis (Collas et al., 1999). Similarly, RSK1 is also important for G1 \u2192 S progression (Fujita et al., 2003;Cargnello and Roux, 2011). Thus, it appears that AKAP95, by associating with RSK1 and the other proteins, facilitates G1 \u2192 S progression, DNA synthesis, chromosome condensation, mitosis, and orchestrating of overall cell cycle progression.",

The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 200 \u00d7 g to remove intact cells and cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 10 min to pellet cell nuclei. The nuclear pellet was washed and centrifuged again. The 1000 \u00d7 g supernatants were then centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 g to generate the cytosolic fraction. The proteins in nuclear and cytosolic fractions were subjected to Western analysis."

            "text": "NIH3T3 cells were plated in eight-chamber slides at 10,000 cells/ well. Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-RSK1 or its mutant using Metafectene Pro transfection reagent (Biontex Laboratories GmbH, Martinsried, Germany). Similarly, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-AKAP95 or its 3M mutant, which does not localize inside the nucleus, using TransIT-HeLaMONSTER Transfection Kit. One day after transfection, cells were serum starved for 24 h and then replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 18 h, followed by addition of 10 \u03bcM BrdU and 4 h of incubation. The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/ PBS for 10 min. To denature DNA, cells were incubated with 2 N HCl at room temperature for 30 min. After extensive washes with PBS and 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS blocking, cells were incubated with anti-BrdU antibody (mouse monoclonal) and anti-HA antibody (rabbit polyclonal) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibodies were Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody or Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. The images were obtained by a multiphoton Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning microscope as described. The results are expressed as the percentage of cells showing nuclear staining with BrdU."
