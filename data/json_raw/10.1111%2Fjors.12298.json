From 1970 to 2010, rental housing's price increased, renters' incomes decreased, but, unexpectedly, renters' real housing consumption increased. We find neither demographics nor housing supply factors account for the anomalous post-1970 increase in renters' housing consumption. We conclude that after 1970 there was a nationwide increase in renters' preferences for housing consumption. With incomes falling, renters increased housing consumption by decreasing consumption of other necessities including food, clothing, and transportation.",

            "text": "Virtually all Americans have been renters in the housing market at some point in their lives-as young adults starting out, during life transitions such as divorce or job change, or as senior citizens downsizing from the family home. For low-and moderateincome Americans, rental housing is often the only viable option available because their incomes and savings are insufficient to finance the purchase of a home and to pay the costs of upkeep over time. As the subprime mortgage crisis underscores, homeownership is not for everyone. According to the 2010 Census, just over a third of all U.S. households lived in rented dwellings.",

            "text": "For most renters, like most homeowners, the cost of housing absorbs a significant portion of household income. In this paper, we explore the changing circumstances of renters in 20 of the largest U.S. urban housing markets over the past seven decades, with special attention to the past four decades. We focus on providing a unique, long-term view of changes in the income of renters, the rents they pay, and the quantity of housing they consume. Decennial census data reveal that from 1930 to 1970, most renters' incomes rose while the price of rental housing services fell. In contrast, from 1970 to 2010, most renters' incomes fell and the price of rental housing services rose. We break down the post-1970 changing distribution of rents into changes in the price of rental housing services and changes in quantity of rental housing services consumed. Here we encounter a striking puzzle that has not been documented in the existing literature. Despite falling renter incomes and increasing prices of rental housing services, since 1970 renters have markedly increased their consumption of rental housing services, which leads us to ask whether demographic changes might have driven changes in consumption separately from changes in incomes and prices. The answer is mixed: an estimated demand function confirms that demographics do matter-most notable, renting baby-boomers and their successors consume markedly more housing than do people born prior to World War II-but there remain large increases over time in housing consumption that are not accounted for by incomes, prices, or demographics. Do supply factors account for the increased housing consumption of renters? Our evidence suggests that supply considerations do not provide an explanation.",

We turn in the last section of the paper to documenting these changes in other goods' budget shares over the past eight decades using the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). Examining expenditure shares of renters from 1935 to 2011, we find that rent's budget share generally increases over the time span, peaking in 2011. From 1935 through the early 1970s the increases in rent's budget share are offset by declines in food's share. Since the 1970s, food's budget share has largely flattened. From the early 1970s through 2011, increases in rent's budget share and similar increases in \"Other\" spending are offset by decreases in the budget shares of food, transport, and clothing. Our evidence suggests that the usual suspects (demographics, supply factors) do not explain the increase in the housing consumption of renters. While there is certainly room for more research to explain the phenomenon, our analysis suggests that there has been a fundamental change in the tastes of renters; they have a stronger preference for housing consumption.",

            "text": "With our focus on the long-term changes in renter incomes, rents paid, and housing services consumed, this paper builds on the extensive housing affordability literature. In a widely cited paper, Quigley and Raphael (2004) summarize the evidence that between 1960 and 2000, lower income renters sharply increased the fraction of their income spent on rent. 1 While some analysts bemoan rental housing's unaffordability, 2 some note that the increased spending has brought a reduction in the numbers of households living in 1 The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies reports that \"the share of US households unable to find affordable rentals has been on the rise for a half-century, with an especially large jump in the last decade\" and \"affordability is likely to deteriorate further over the next few years\" (Joint Center for Housing Studies, 2011). For many years there was much concern about the \"adequacy\" of rental housing; prior to 1960, many units lacked basic plumbing and heating or were markedly overcrowded. For example, in 1949 many large families lived in small quarters and more than 40 percent of units lacked complete indoor plumbing (Gabriel, 1996). In the mid-1980s, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) analysts began counting the number of very poor households with what came to be known as \"worst case housing needs.\" HUD found that substandard and crowded housing had become very infrequent problems, while housing expenditures in excess of 50 percent of income was the most often-faced problem among these households. For example, by 1993 HUD found that 95 percent of worst housing needs cases were due to rents in excess of 50 percent of income, while substandard or overcrowded housing occurred in only 9 percent of the worst housing needs cases (HUD, 1996, p. 13).",

            "text": "Our approach to measuring rents and housing consumption is based on an extensive literature. Urban economists rely on two primary models of housing: the housing services model and the hedonic price model. In the housing services model, housing is treated as a composite commodity in which attributes of housing are collapsed into a single homogeneous good. In the hedonic price model, housing is represented as a bundle of distinct attributes, each with its own pricing. Prices in the housing services model are generally measured by price indices. The quantity of housing services is then defined as rent divided by price. The best known rental housing price index is the contract rent index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Prices in the hedonic price model are generally measured by regressions of rent (or house value) on a vector of housing units' characteristics. The American Housing Survey (AHS) has provided the richest source of attribute information for hedonic price estimation. Murray (1978) offers theoretical and empirical arguments that indicate that neither the housing services nor the hedonic price model is uniformly more general than the other. In this light, the choice of model depends largely on what question is being asked and what data are available. For example, if the question asked is about the benefits accruing to households from living in public housing, as in Murray (1975), then the housing services model can suffice, while if the question asked is about changes in the quality of rental housing units over time, as in Gordon and vanGoethem (2007), then the hedonic price model can prove especially powerful. In this analysis, we rely chiefly on the housing services model, though we do present some data from the AHS on specific housing attributes.",

The BLS index is not perfect and many researchers have addressed biases in these indices (biases we address in our analysis of the BLS data). Crone et al. (2010) report that prior to 1977 the BLS omitted from its contract rent sample units that had a change of tenant or that were vacant. Their paper presents a national contract rent index that corrects for the consequent downward bias in the BLS. They find that rental housing's price rose considerably more between 1940 and 1985 than indicated by the BLS index.

            "text": "A further problem with the BLS rent index, shared with the other indices mentioned above, is their reliance on contract rent, i.e., on rents paid to landlords. Contract rents often include some utilities while excluding others; indeed, contract rents sometimes exclude utilities altogether. Which utilities are included in contract rent has varied considerably over time and across cities. Consequently, contract rents do not provide a measure of expenditure on a consistently defined mix of housing and utilities. The oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s increased gross rents appreciably, but these increases are missed in contract rents for units in which utilities are not included in rent. Moreover, Integrated Public Use Microsamples (IPUMS) data reveal that in the 1970s and 1980s, many landlords responded to higher utility costs by excluding utilities from rent when renegotiating rents, exacerbating the downward bias in the BLS contract rent index as a gross rent index. The U.S. Census and the American Community Survey (ACS) collect data on both contract rent and expenditure on utilities not included in rent. These data do not suffice for separating housing and utility expenditures, but they do permit the construction of \"gross rent,\" which is the sum of housing expenditure and total utility expenditure. Appendix 1 reports how we use city-specific contract rent indices, the cityspecific CPI utility price indices, the BLS 1970 budget data, and census and ACS data on contract rents and gross rents to construct city-specific \"gross rent\" price indices appropriate to measuring real gross rents. 3 We then adopt the housing services model and define the quantity of rental housing services a household consumes to be the household's gross rent divided by the city-specific gross rent price index for that consumer's location. Figure 1 shows both the BLS rent index and our gross rent price index relative to the CPI price index for all goods less shelter. 4 The BLS relative prices from 1935 to 2010 are indicated by the closely spaced symbols in Figure 1. Our relative gross rent prices for 1970-2010 are indicated by the widely spaced symbols. The bases for the two indices 3 When using the BLS contract rent index to construct an \"equivalent rent\" for homeowners for use in the CPI, the BLS makes an adjustment for utilities in the contract rent index. But it is the unadjusted contract rent index that is used for the renter shelter price index in the CPI (Poole et al., 2005, pp. 20-22, 29). 4 Since Gordon and vanGoethem (2007) caution against using national indices for subnational analyses, we rely on the BLS city-specific rent indices to construct our gross indices for most analyses here. However, in our regression analysis, we check for the robustness of our results to using a national gross rent index grounded in the national contract rent indices of Crone et al. (2010).  are set so that the relative prices coincide in 1970. The sharpest difference in relative price changes between the two series are for the 1970s, when the contract-rent-based BLS measure fails to capture the sharp 1970s increases in utility expenditures and in the proportion of \"utilities not included\" rents among contract rents.",

Rent-to-income ratios fell for all income quintiles from 1940 to 1960, 6 and, until 1970, continued to fall slightly for the wealthiest quintiles; the poorest quintiles began to see increases in their rent income ratios by 1970. Since 1970, rent income ratios have risen. Clearly, the post-1970 increases have been sharpest for renters in the poorest quintiles of the renter income distribution 7 ; but even the wealthiest renters have seen the share spent on rent rise from 12 percent in 1970 to 18 percent in 2010. 8 What has driven the changes in rent-income ratios over time?

Census data reveals that renters' real incomes rose 110 percent between 1940 and 1960. Because housing is income inelastic, renters opted to reduce their rent to income ratios over this period. 9 Moreover, a BLS index of the price of rental services and the CPI reveal a dramatic 33 percent drop in the relative price of rental housing services from 1935 to 1950 that has only been partially undone subsequently. 6 The 1950 Census did not collect data on rents. The ratios observed in 1940 are not simply a reflection of the end of the Depression or pre-World War II buildup conditions; the ratio of median rent to estimated median income was about the same when the Depression started as when it was ending. The 1930 Census did not gather income data, but U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) estimates imply that real per capita income in 1940 was 15.4 percent above that of 1930 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series F-4, p. 224) and 1930 Census data and CPI data indicate that real rents were 6 percent lower in 1940 than in 1930. These changes indicate a ratio of median rent to median income, rent-income, of 0.27 in 1930; that ratio was 0.25 in 1940, which is equal to the ratio observed in 1990 and well above the 0.19 observed in both 1960 and 1970.",

Individuals with negative incomes are excluded; for 1970-2000, individuals with rents at or above the IPUMS top codes are excluded from analyses of rents; for 2000-2010, individuals with the highest 1 percent of rents are excluded for comparability with the earlier top-coded samples.

Also, the price indices for real income changes 28.7 percent, on average, across the 16 cities for which we have such price data. 12 The changes in the price of rental housing services varied considerably across the cities between 1970 and 2010, as evidenced by the percentage changes in that price reported in Column 2 of Table 3. 13 Since renters' incomes fell and the price of housing services rose, it is natural to expect that real housing consumption fell between 1970 and 2010. But it did not. The median quantity of housing services renters consumed rose more than 20 percent between 1970 and 2010, and mean real housing consumption rose in every renter income quintile, as evidenced by Table 4, which reports the national level of real housing consumption for each quintile in each of our sample years. (A value of one in Table 4 corresponds to the are the local CPI, which include an owners' shelter component which is much more heavily weighted than the renters' shelter component. The real housing changes are created using our gross rent index. The real changes in nonhousing consumption are created using the CPI local nonshelter indices. Where owners' shelter costs rose more markedly than renters' shelter costs, the real income changes and real consumption changes can fail to match up as one might expect.",

Table 6, column 1 reports the results from a 16 metropolitan area 15 fixed effects OLS regression with robust standard errors clustered by city-year. The dependent variable is the quantity of housing services consumed: gross rent in current dollars divided by the local current price of housing services. The housing price index used in column 1 is our gross rent index grounded in the BLS contract rent index (see appendix 1 for the steps required to turn a contract rent index into a gross rent index). Column 2 contains comparable regression results based on a gross rent index grounded in the national contract rent index of Crone et al. (2010). The goods for which prices are included in the demand equations are housing, food, medical care, transportation, and apparel, plus a price for \"all other goods.\" 16 Food is the numeraire good: income and the prices of nonfood goods are divided by the price of food. Since demand functions are homogeneous of degree zero in prices and income, we constrain the numeraire good's cross-price elasticity with housing to be minus the sum of the estimated coefficients on income and the other prices. 17 The regression also 15 Footnote 7 details the sources for our data in Tables 6-8. The OLS regressions are for only 16 of the 20 cities in our original sample. Baltimore, Phoenix, Tampa, and Washington DC lack some of the required price data for each year. Miami and Pittsburgh lack some required data for some years. While using a balanced panel would ensure that the year dummies cannot reflect year-to-year changes in the geographic composition of the sample, we include Miami and Pittsburgh in the OLS regressions because doing so changes almost all estimated coefficients, including the key parameters (year dummies and housing's income and own-price elasticities) only in the third decimal place-and changes no parameter appreciably. The larger sample is more nationally representative and the added observations increase efficiency. We exclude households reporting negative or zero incomes or rents. 16 We rely on the metropolitan-specific CPI indices to construct our nonhousing price variables. The exceptions are two: (i) the food price in 1970, for which only a national index is available, and (ii) the price for \"other goods,\" which we construct from the local CPI for all goods but shelter, local CPI's for food, medical care, transportation, and apparel, and the annual national relative importance of the CPI components reported by the Department of Labor. The local CPI's only track local rates of price change, not intercity price differences. To make cross-city comparisons, we relied on the BLS \"Three Budgets for an Urban Family of Four Persons\" U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (1972) which in 1970 tracked the prices of specific quantities of goods across 40 U.S. cities, thereby providing cross-city goods-price indices for 1970. One of the BLS budgets was specifically for renters and provides a base from which local prices then grew in accord with the local CPIs. Using city-specific fixed effects and the logs of prices absorbs the intercity differentials. 17 We fail to reject this null hypothesis of homogeneity at a 5 percent significance level. includes variables for year, household size and composition, and the household head's ethnicity, race, age group, and birth cohort. The omitted category is two-parent households with a white head of prime working age born during the baby boom. The demographic variables' estimated coefficients and standard errors are reported in Appendix 1.1. The regression's R 2 is 0.28. The central message of Table 6, first seen in columns 1 and 2 and then repeated in columns 3 and 4, is found in the significance and magnitudes of the coefficients on the year dummies (collectively the coefficients are highly statistically significant in both the OLS and IV regressions, with P-values less than 0.00005): even allowing for taste differences among cohorts, prices, income, and demographics, rental housing demand has risen markedly between 1970 and 2010. (Had we used the lower contract rent index of Ambrose et al. (2015) for 2000-2010, we would have calculated even larger demand increases over that decade.)",

            "text": "Mayo notes that income elasticity estimates based on current income tend to be smaller than those based on permanent income. Our income elasticity may have a further downward bias due to measurement error inherent in the census asking people about current rent, but last year's income. 20 We use the household head's education as an instrument for income; education is correlated with permanent income and, we assume, uncorrelated with transient income and errors from using lagged income. Column 4 of Table 6 reports the results from a 2SLS IV estimation of the demand function of column 1. The IV-estimated price elasticity, \u22120.39, is only slightly larger than the OLS estimate, but the IV-estimated income elasticity, 0.53, is much higher than the OLS estimate. These estimates are more in line with past studies than were the OLS estimates. 21 Because the 18 The dependent variable in our demand equations is the natural log of reported rent less the natural log of price. In our log-log specification, subtracting the log of price from both sides alters only the coefficient on the log of price. In particular, it has no effect on the disturbances. Consequently, any instrument valid for estimating a rent regression is also valid for estimation when the dependent variable is the log of rent less the log of price. It is tempting to look for land price data to use as an instrument, given the importance of land's cost in supply. However, a valid instrument cannot be correlated with the part of an endogenous explanatory that is correlated with the disturbance term (Murray, 2006). Land values are largely locally driven, so shocks to local housing demand are likely to be reflected in local land prices. We would need an instrument with both temporal and cross-sectional variation that is uncorrelated with the endogenous component of land price. Such is hard to come by. 19 The construction cost index (http://enr.construction.com/economics) is based on \"200 hours of common labor at the 20-city average of common labor rates, plus 25 cwt of standard structural steel shapes at the mill price prior to 1996 and the fabricated 20-city price from 1996, plus 1.128 tons of Portland cement at the 20-city price, plus 1,088 board-ft of 2 \u00d7 4 lumber at the 20-city price.\" The building cost index is based on \"68.38 hours of skilled labor at the 20-city average of bricklayers, carpenters and structural iron workers rates, plus 25 cwt of standard structural steel shapes at the mill price prior to 1996 and the fabricated 20-city price from 1996, plus 1.128 tons of Portland cement at the 20-city price, plus 1,088 board ft of 2 \u00d7 4 lumber at the 20-city price.\" Many of the components of the index are determined in regional markets, but labor's cost is determined more locally. Since rent is one determinant of local wages among many, there remains room for concern about the construction cost index as a valid instrument. 20 The incomes in the regression have been adjusted for price differences between the census year and the preceding year, but not for any growth or fall in incomes. 21 The P-values of the F-statistics for the relevance of the instruments in the rental-housing price and income reduced form equations are 0.053 and less than 0.0005, respectively. While the instruments appear relevant, we find that the instruments are weak for rental housing's price (using Finlay and Magnuson's 2009 riv test routine in STATA, which is robust to clustered disturbances, and conditioning on the IV estimate of the income elasticity). The instruments' weakness arises because fixed-effects for city and year in the model absorb much of the variation in both the cost indices and the price of rental housing, leaving IV estimates are only for a sample of 11 cities, 22 we also report, in column 3 of Table 6, the results of an OLS regression for those 11 cities. Note that the 11-city income and price elasticities, \u22120.37 and 0.18, are very close to the full sample OLS estimates; the time dummies also have similar coefficients in the two regressions. The similar estimates in columns 1 and 3 encourage us to consider the IV estimates from the 11 cities as instructive for the 16 cities. 23 The estimated demographic effects are unsurprising and almost all are statistically significant. Larger households consume more housing; single-parents living with no other adult consume more housing than households with two or more adults; non-Hispanic whites consume more housing than other groups; cross-price elasticities are generally small and often statistically insignificant, though the estimate of 0.18 for transportation strikes us as unduly large; the implicit OLS estimate of the cross-price elasticity of housing with respect to the price of food is \u22120.31 and statistically significant; and the baby-boomers and their successors consume more housing than earlier birth cohorts. This last result is consonant with the basic theme of this paper: tastes for housing change over time. Household heads born prior to World War II have a substantially different view of what constitutes suitable housing than do household heads from the baby-boom generation and their successors; prewar households consume about 10 percent less housing than babyboomers, ceteris paribus. (We experimented with several variants of the age variable specification. The estimated cohort effects were robust to these.)",

            "text": "Tables 4 and 5 indicate that the largest shifts in demand occurred in the South. Regression analyses confirm that finding. Table 7 reports OLS and IV estimated coefficients for year dummies by region from regressions that again control for income, prices, demographics, and metropolitan area. The reported coefficients estimate how much the intercept term for a given decade and region differs from the 1970 intercept term for that same region. In both OLS and IV regressions, 23 of 24 estimated differences are positive. The largest estimated effects are for the southern region; the other three regions appear to have similarly smaller increases in demand. We reject at conventional significance levels the hypotheses that demand has been unchanging, either everywhere or in some one specific region. 24 Implicit in the estimates reported in Tables 6 and 7 is a story about when the shifts in renters' demands for housing occurred. Table 8 makes this story explicit by reporting the changes in the estimated coefficients of Table 6 from one time period to the next. little variation in either for estimating the price elasticity. In the model specified without city fixed-effects, we find the instruments for rental housing's price, as well as for income, are not weak. The resulting price and income elasticities are \u22120.55 and 0.53, respectively, very like estimates elsewhere. The IV estimates for the year dummies are little affected by dropping the city fixed-effects, though they become slightly larger after 2000 without fixed-effects. The weak instrument robustness of our estimation and inference about exogenous variables is consonant with the discussion of Andrews and Stock (2007) who report several alternative criteria for such robustness-one of which our data satisfy. Since our interest in these regressions is in exogenous variables-specifically whether controlling for demographics (in addition to prices and income) eliminates the seeming effects of time on renters' demands-the possible weakness of the price instruments is not a particular problem for us.",

It is therefore heartening that Fuller's approximately unbiased IV estimator (Fuller, 1977), which has been shown in numerous Monte Carlos to be weak instrument robust as a point estimator (e.g., Hahn et al., 2004;Andrews and Stock, 2007) yields essentially the same price and income elasticities as 2SLS does in our sample. For more about instrument weakness and our analysis, see footnote 22. 24 The census and ACS surveys are drawn independently across the years. Consequently, each year's data offers independent information about changes in housing demand over time.  Qualitatively, the OLS and IV results are in accord that the largest shifts in renters' demand for housing occurred in the 1980s and between 2000 and 2005. The IV results expose statistically significant changes in every period but the 1970s and 1990s. 25 A similar pattern is seen for each region using the results of Table 7, but the IV estimates are less precise for the year-by-region results.",

If housing were a conventional good and unaffected by government policies, the price of housing services would suffice for capturing the effects of supply on people's consumption of housing. In that case, our instrumental variables estimates would properly account for the interactions of supply and demand. However, housing is not conventional good and housing markets are targets of government policy. 25 The 1970s and 1990s were the only two periods of increased income equality (the 1970s) or lessened increasing income inequality (the 1990s) in our sample years (Autor et al., 2008). We, therefore, examined whether increased income inequality might spur renters' housing consumption by increasing the amount of housing the less wealthy renters would need to \"keep up\" with the wealthier, home-owning \"Jones'.\" Including in our model one or another of various city-and-year-specific measures of income inequality had only small effects on the time dummy coefficients reported in Table 6. Inequality's estimated coefficients were always small, generally insignificant, and of mixed signs. Keeping up with the Jones' is not the root of the observed shift in renters' housing demand.",

As housing units depreciate, they tend to become occupied by less wealthy tenants. This filtering process is a centerpiece of the housing literature. Governments' intervention in housing markets comes in two primary forms: the provision of subsidies for housing supply or demand and land use and building regulations. Lowry (1960) provides a clear intuitive account of the filtering process. Sweeney (1974) provides a definitive theoretical framework for analyzing this filtering process. Empirical work on filtering is scarce, but Rosenthal (2014) provides evidence describing the connections among housing's depreciation rate, households' price and income elasticities of demand, changes in the market price of housing, and the path of dwellings through the income distribution. Unfortunately, Rosenthal's work, rooted in housing demand, does not reveal the empirical structure of the dynamic interaction between housing supply and housing demand that might ideally inform our work. At the core of Sweeney's model of filtering is the notion of hierarchies of dwellings. New dwellings tend to sit at the top of the hierarchy since they tend to be of above average quality. Suppliers of these new dwellings are responsive to the housing demands of wealthier households. Households a little lower on the wealth ladder tend to choose from the slightly depreciated dwellings now abandoned by the occupants of new dwellings.",

In our data, when the proportion of units less than 10 and between 10 and 20 years of age and the proportion of the stock built before 1950 are added to the regression of column 1, Table 6, they prove collectively insignificant and the estimated coefficients on the year dummies are only modestly reduced. Besides recent new construction, another possibility for filtering raising renters' consumption is through increased homeownership. Often, becoming a homeowner means leaving an apartment to buy a house. Many rental units left behind by such (usually) higher income renters become available to lower income tenants. As seen in Table 1, homeownership rates were rising over much of our sample period. Did units newly available to the growing number of renters simply provide much more housing than the units occupied in 1970, leaving renters no choice but to occupy such units? The local homeownership rate, when added to the regressions in column 1 of Table 6, proves only marginally statistically significant, with an unexpectedly positive coefficient, while other coefficients are not much changed. Shifting homeownership rates do not account for the conundrum of increasing real housing consumption as renters' incomes fall and rental housing's price rises.",

By 2010, the number of units of such quality had fallen by a fifth, despite falling incomes of renters and growing numbers of renters in all of these cities. The lost low-quality units may have been removed from the stock or they may have been upgraded to serve higher income households. While gentrification has replaced or upgraded low-end units in many neighborhoods in many cities, the scale of gentrification across 17 cities and across the four decade time span of our study seems too small to explain the changes we observe in the low-rent stock. 26 If renters are pressed by limits on supply to consume more housing than they would like, why would the low-quality units leave the stock? 27 A filtering account of renters' increased housing consumption is inconsistent with the documented loss of low-end units.",

However, Quigley and Raphael also note that there are no studies that explicitly measure the impact of land use regulations on the increases in rent burdens over time presented in their analysis (2004, p. 208). In fact, there is limited data measuring the extent of land use regulation by locality and there is no data on changes over time. Saiz (2010) and Turner et al. (2014) provide compelling evidence that regulation, as well as local geographic constraints, impact housing supply and, further, that regulatory regimes are endogenous, changing with local housing market conditions. One question facing us, then, is whether the observed rise in rental housing's income share for renters is attributable to changing regulatory conditions between 1970 and the present. Saiz (2010) and Turner et al. (2014) argue convincingly that housing regulation variation across cities has considerable effect on supply. If regulation varies as much over time as it does over space, then changing regulation might account for renters' increased housing consumption. Lacking an intertemporal measure of regulation, Saiz (2010) and Turner et al. (2014) between 2000 and 2010 with 20 percent of tracts with low incomes and low house values experiencing gentrification compared with just 9 percent in the 1990s. While some of our cities appear to have experienced gentrification in the study, there are no estimates of the impact on the size and quality of the housing stock. (Gentrification is measured by increases in house values, incomes, and share of the population 25 years and older with bachelor's degrees.) Nonetheless, gentrification might have contributed to renters' increased consumption in some cities. However, the increase in demand we observe is ubiquitous, while gentrification is not.",

An assumption of the BLS price index, and hence of ours, is that the law of one price applies to housing services. 28 In 1990, Congress mandated that HUD report annually the number of households facing worst case housing needs, including affordability problems (e.g., U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2007). HUD subsequently formed a commission to study regulatory barriers to affordable housing (Downs, 1991). More recently, DiPasquale and Murray (2008) document a sharp decline in the number of low-rent housing units available in American cities, despite growing numbers of renters. Numerous studies have focused on the dynamics of such changes, asking why, as time passes, do some units disappear from the affordable stock and others appear in it (e.g., Nelson and Vandenbroucke, 1996;Somerville and Holmes, 2001;Somerville and Mayer, 2003). These many studies rely chiefly on the AHS and most limit attention to a single decade or less. Some offer national numbers, others regional numbers, while still others report outcomes for a small number of cities. Only Nelson and Vandenbroucke (1996) report on a large number of cities (41), but they observe each of those cities for only four years. Where these studies' time periods overlap with DiPasquale and Murray's longer, census-based work, the results are in basic agreement.",

However, there is some suggestive evidence that points away from changing regulation as the cause. Table 3 reveals that for all but the first income quintile, most of renters' increase in real housing consumption occurred between 1970 and 1990. (The increase in the lowest quintile has occurred more smoothly over time.) The 1970 and 1990 censuses identified households as \"urban\" or \"rural,\" where \"urban\" denotes any city or incorporated place of more than 2,500 inhabitants. Rural households made up 11 percent of all renter households in 1970. Anderson (2012) argues that county governments were very slow to adopt land use controls in rural areas and rural land remains less regulated than urban land. 29 Because housing market regulation is markedly more extensive in urban areas and their surroundings than in truly rural areas, we expect that between 1970 and 1990 the renters designated as rural experienced less regulationdriven increased housing consumption than did urban renters. Did these rural renters increase their real housing consumption less than urban renters did?",

Shifts in incomes and prices in rural areas relative to urban areas could account for rural rent-income ratios rising as urban ratios did without the pressure of sharply increased regulation.

Given the income inelasticity of housing demand, this relative shift would tend to make rural household's rent-income ratios rise relative to those for urban households by about 1.5 percent. Thus, differential urban-rural income changes are not sufficient to account for rural rent-income ratios keeping up with supposedly regulation-driven increases in urban areas.",

However, such differential price changes would have to have been quite substantial given housing's price inelasticity and the large increases in urban rent-income ratios induced by substantial quantity increases in urban areas. Moreover, such a marked differential change in prices would have to have involved rural housing services' price rising markedly from 1970 to 1990 relative to the urban price. 29  Anderson (2012) argues that the lack of land use control at the urban fringe in unincorporated rural areas contributed to urban sprawl over time. While she acknowledges that data on rural land use regulation is scarce, she argues land use controls were largely adopted by urban municipalities not county governments from the 1930s through the late 1970s and 1980s. Regional planning efforts became more common in county government in the 1970s and 1980s which brought some land use controls but the fiscal needs of county government encouraged prodevelopment positions and weak land use controls (Anderson, 2012, p. 377). 30 These ratios are for renters with strictly positive incomes and rents for real income and rent levels not top-coded in either 1970 or 1990. Such a large increase in the rural rental-housing services' price relative to the urban price strikes us as implausible. Thus, unless housing market regulation changed equally dramatically in both urban and rural areas between 1970 and 1990, the comparable rent-income ratio increases in rural and urban areas argue against changes in regulation being the cause of the observed increase in real housing consumption between 1970 and 1990.",

Real nonhousing consumption fell 21.8 percent. Changes in rent's budget share must be accompanied by offsetting changes in other goods' budget shares. Which goods would renters cut most, and which least? We employ the CEX to analyze the changing composition of renters' household budgets from 1935 to 2010. Figure 3 reports the gross rent share of total household expenditures for 1935-2011 for each of the five total expenditure quintiles using the CEX. 31 While the patterns over time of the rentto-income ratios shown in Figure 2 and the rent-to-expenditure ratios in Figure 3 are similar, there are some differences: (i) the spike in rent to expenditure ratio in 1973-1974; (ii) the much lower rent ratios for households in the lowest quintile; and (iii) the increase in that quintile's rent ratio from 1935 to 1960. 32 The spike might be due to sharply increased utility expenditures during the first oil shock of the 1970s. The higher rent-to-income ratios for the first quintile are probably due to substantial numbers of 31 We obtained the 1935, 1961, and 1973 CEX data from ICPSR. We obtained the 2011 CEX data from the BLS CEX website. The other years' CEX data were obtained from NBER's CEX website. Those who wish to replicate our findings using our code will need first to obtain the raw data from ICPSR, NBER, and BLS. Combining the data from the several years required numerous small judgments about categories across the years; our code reflects those judgments. 32 The CEX contains income data. The rent-to-income ratios using the CEX data look very much like Figure 2 except that, as in Figure 3  reported low incomes that stem from including substantial transitory financial losses in income, coupled with the high rents paid in accord with usually much higher incomes. 33 With declines in renter income as housing's expenditure share is increasing, renters are decreasing their consumption of other things; column 4 of Table 3 reports the percentage change from 1970 to 2010 in median real nonhousing consumption for the 16 cities for which we have a local all goods but shelter CPI. Real nonhousing consumption fell in 12 of the cities and by 21.9 percent overall. The CEX allows us to detail the distribution of this reduced spending across budget items. Figure 4 shows the trends in mean budget shares by spending category from 1935 to 2011. The spending categories were chosen to indicate budget shares devoted to necessities. In 2011, the largest components of the \"Other\" category are insurance, pensions, and entertainment. As shown in Figure 4, rent's budget share increases over most of the time span, peaking in 2011. Food's budget share declines significantly until the early 1970s then flattens out through 2011. As shown in Table 9, the total change in budget shares from 1935 through 2011 is dominated by increases in rent budget share (13.4 percentage point increase) that are largely offset by declines in the food budget share (12.5 percentage point decrease). However, since 1972-1973, the size of the rent share increase is two and a half times the size of the food share decrease. The rent share increase and similar increase in the \"Other\" spending share are offset by declines in budget shares for food, transport, and clothing. The rise in rent budget share between 2001 and 2011 is offset with decreases in shares for transport, clothing, and other spending.",

From 1940 to 1970, American renters shared in the growing prosperity of other Americans. Renters spent less of their incomes on housing while increasing the quantities of housing consumed. Since 1970, renter incomes fell, the price of rental housing services rose, but renters consumed more housing. With declining incomes, renters have faced tough choices. Their increase in housing consumption was accompanied by decreases in spending on clothing, food, and transport.",

Our results show that the increases in housing consumption are far from fully explained by demographic changes in the U.S. renter population. While lack of data limit our ability to provide definitive analysis of the impact of supply factors on the increase in renters' housing consumption, the evidence we do have indicate that the increases in housing consumption among renters are not due to commonly suggested supply factors. Filtering as measured by the age composition of the stock does not account for the increase in housing consumption. A lack of time series data on regulation by city precludes us from directly assessing the role of regulation in increased housing consumption, but indirect evidence suggests that regulation has not driven those increases. Our analysis supports the claim that in the years since 1970 there has been a fundamental change in the tastes of renters-they have a stronger preference for housing consumption. APPENDIX 1.",

From 1970 to 2010, the role of utilities has changed significantly. Utility costs have increased substantially and the portion of units where rents include utilities has decreased. We construct cityspecific gross rent indices from the BLS city-specific contract rent indices. The IPUMS census and ACS data allow us to estimate the fraction of rents in the BLS sample that are gross rents and the fraction where contract rents do not include utilities (using numbers of households with contract rents and the numbers of households with gross rents not equal to contract rent).
