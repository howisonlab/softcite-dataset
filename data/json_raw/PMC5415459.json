Methods: Data from 293 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were classified according to the new classification. Fisher's exact, \u03c7 2 , and log-rank tests and Cox regression analysis were used to analyze correlations between EGFR mutation status, lung cancer prognosis, and the new histologic subtype. Disease-free survival and progressionfree survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Lepidic and non-solid adenocarcinomas showed significantly elevated EGFR mutation rates (79.0% and 65.8%, respectively; P < 0.05). EGFR mutation status was only associated with gender (P < 0.001). EGFR mutation-positive patients who received targeted therapy had better median PFS than those who received chemotherapy as first-line treatment (P < 0.001). The median PFS of patients with exon 19 and exon 21 mutations who received first-line targeted therapy were 12.5 and 9.5 months, respectively (P = 0.970). Patients with micropapillary predominant adenocarcinomas had the shortest disease-free survival (<18 months) and PFS. Histologic subtype (P = 0.036), treatment type (P = 0.031), and EGFR mutation status (P = 0.019) might be good prognostic factors for lung adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: Patients with exon 19 mutations obtained greater benefits from targeted therapy. In the new classification, EGFR mutation rates are higher in lepidic cases and in cases without the solid subtype. The micropapillary subtype of adenocarcinoma has the worst prognosis, while the lepidic subtype has the best.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is currently one of the major causes of cancerrelated death worldwide. It is the leading cause of cancerrelated death in China, and often results in greater rates of morbidity and mortality than heart disease and cerebrovascular disorders. 1 Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is the most common histological subtype of lung cancer. Its incidence has increased over the past decades, and it occurs in about 50% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). 2 In 2011, in light of improvements in our understanding of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, a joint working group of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) proposed a new histologic classification of lung adenocarcinoma. This classification method has been referred to as \"the new IASLC/ATS/ERS lung adenocarcinoma classification\" or \"the new classification.\" 3 Using the new classification, it is possible to screen for early-stage NSCLC in patients at high risk. Furthermore, the new classification can favorably guide postoperative adjuvant treatment, although there are some limitations for advanced lung cancer. [4][5][6] Epidermal growth factor receptortyrosine-kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have significant survival benefits for advanced lung cancer. In NSCLC, EGFR mutations chiefly occur in adenocarcinomas, followed by adenosquamous cell, large-cell undifferentiated, and miscellaneous carcinomas, and are least common in squamous cell carcinomas (<5%). 7 In clinical trials of patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations, chemotherapy was inferior to EGFR-TKIs, which prolonged median survival to 3.5 years. [8][9][10][11][12][13] Therefore, pretreatment genetic testing is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) for cases of advanced lung cancer. In 2014 in China, however, the proportion of patients who received a genetic test was only 27% (although a higher testing rate of 51% was observed in the larger cities, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou). 14 These relatively low proportions may be explained by the use of mainly exploratory techniques that are yet to be widely adopted, as well as by the presence of notable limitations to specimens. Several studies have attempted to explore the predictive value of the new classification in cases with EGFR mutation. 15,16 At present, we are unable to determine the larger clinical implications because some outcomes associated with the EGFR mutation rate are higher in micropapillary predominant adenocarcinomas than in invasive mucinous and solid predominant adenocarcinomas, both in China and internationally.",

In the new classification, evidence of a subtype present in >5% of the specimen confirms a diagnosis of that subtype, a subtype present in >40% of the specimen was defined as predominant, and other subtypes were considered mixed. We used the American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor node metastasis (TNM) classification criteria. 17 The resected tumor specimens were subjected to EGFR mutational analysis using DNA sequencing, as well as fluorescence PCR analyses of biopsy specimens. The results were regarded as reliable because biopsy specimens show only pathologic analysis and not variety. DNA sequencing was conducted as follows. DNA extraction: The specimens were cut serially into coronal and sagittal slices of 4 \u03bcm thickness using a microtome. The tumor cells were enriched to determine which cells contained \u226570% evidence of cancer. DNA from paraffinized tissues samples was isolated using a QIAamp DNA FFPE Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

It further includes acinar, lepidic, papillary, solid, and micropapillary predominant disease. In the new classification, a subtype with >5% presence is considered contained, a subtype with >40% presence is defined as predominant, and other percentages are defined as mixed. 20 Studies from Europe and the United States reported a ratio of <20% prevalence of lepidic predominant and papillary predominant cases, 10-40% prevalence of acinar predominant cases, 20-40% prevalence of solid predominant cases, Figure 2 The relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and the choice of first-line treatment in patients with stage III-IV adenocarcinomas.

The NCCN, ESMO, and ASCO recommend performing EGFR gene testing before the initiation of treatment; however, some patients received chemotherapy after receiving a diagnosis and gene testing results, after receiving unclear results, or because they refused to wait for results. In our study, the median PFS rate in patients with stage III-IV disease and EGFR mutations who received targeted therapy was significantly longer than that for patients who received chemotherapy. Furthermore, the difference in PFS was statistically significant (P < 0.001), similar to the results of previous studies. 3,[8][9][10][11][12][13]28 Thus, EGFR status is important for therapy selection. In 2015, ASCO noted that the median PFS in patients who received targeted therapy was longer in patients with exon 19 mutations than in patients with exon 21 mutations. In addition, patients with exon 19 mutations who received targeted therapy had longer PFS than patients with exon 21 mutations who received chemotherapy; however, the difference was not statistically significant in our study. This finding may prompt research into whether patients with exon 19 mutations can benefit from targeted therapy. No statistically significant results were observed for bone or cerebral metastases in the present study, as a result of the small sample sizes of EGFR mutation and wild-type EGFR cases; however, cerebral metastases are more common in patients with EGFR mutations. Sample sizes need to be increased in future research.
