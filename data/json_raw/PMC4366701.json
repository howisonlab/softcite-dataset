This study determined a single ins titution's 30day SSI rate and benchmarked it against that among national institutions par ticipating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Pro gram (ACSNSQIP). Methods Women who underwent ITEBR with/without acellular dermal matrix (ADM) were identified using the ACSNSQIP database between 2005 and 2011. Patient characteristics associated with the 30day SSI rate were determined, and differences in rates between our institution and the national database were assessed. Results 12,163 patients underwent ITEBR, including 263 at our institution. SSIs occurred in 416 (3.4%) patients nationwide excluding our institution, with lower rates observed at our institution (1.9%). Nationwide, SSIs were significantly more common in ITEBR patients with ADM (4.5%) compared to nonADM patients (3.2%, P = 0.005), and this trend was observed at our institution (2.1% vs. 1.6%, P = 1.00). A multivariable analysis of all institutions identified age \u2265 50 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.7), body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m 2 vs. < 25 kg/m 2 (OR, 3.4; CI, 2.6-4.5), and operative time > 4.25 hours (OR, 1.9; CI, 1.5-2.4) as risk factors for SSIs. Our institutional SSI rate was lower than the nationwide rate (OR, 0.4; CI, 0.2-1.1), although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). Conclusions The 30day SSI rate at our institution in patients who underwent ITEBR was lower than the nation. SSIs occurred more frequently in procedures involving ADM both nationally and at our institution.",

            "text": "Implant-based breast reconstruction rates continue to increase across the United States as a percentage of total breast reconstructions [1][2][3]. Immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction (ITEBR) with or without acellular dermal matrix (ADM) remains the most common form of post-mastectomy reconstruction [4]. Many studies have demonstrated that surgical site infections (SSIs) following ITEBR result in significant patient morbidity and health care costs [5]. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database provides outcome data from a wide range of centers, thereby creating national standards for postoperative complications. As a result, individual institutions are increasingly interested in benchmarking their outcomes against national standards in an attempt to improve quality of care and patient safety. This study aims to determine the 30-day SSI rate of a single institution and benchmark it against that among participating national institutions for quality improvement purposes.",

These benefits reduce the need for additional postoperative expansions, improve the lower pole coverage, and enhance the inframammary fold definition [9][10][11].

SSIs were significantly more common in ADM patients compared to non-ADM patients nationally (4.5% vs. 3.2%, respectively; P = 0.005), and this trend was also observed at our institution (2.1% vs. 1.6%, respectively; P = 1.00). Unsurprisingly, organ space SSIs, which is the most invasive and severe type of SSI, were observed less frequently than deep and superficial SSIs were nationwide. When analyzed by subtype, SSIs were still more common in ADM patients than non-ADM patients (P = 0.038). Several studies have demonstrated similar findings [14,15]. Chun et al. [15] showed increased seroma and infection rates in patients reconstructed with ADM, although they proposed that the increased infection rate may have been mediated by seroma and/or native breast skin flap necrosis in this group of patients.",

            "text": "Many modalities have been implemented to reduce these complications, including judicious drain placement with strict criteria for removal [14], the consistent use of perioperative antibiotics [16], and a strict sterile technique in the operating room [16]. More recently, the use of sterile ready-to-use ADM has been advocated [15]. Weichman et al. [17] compared ready-to-use ADM to aseptic ADM in a patient cohort of 546 reconstructed breasts and demonstrated that ready-to-use ADM was associated with a decrease in the overall infection rate, major infection rate, and the need for implant explantation. They concluded that the use of ready-to-use ADM mitigates the risk of infectious complications when compared with aseptic ADM [17]. At our institution, a strict sterile technique and consistent administration of perioperative antibiotics while performing these procedures are routine. We also change our gloves before handling the prosthesis and avoid contact between the ADM and the patient's skin before insertion and placement. The use of drains is also routine in ITEBR, with strict criteria for removal when the output is < 30 mL per day for two consecutive days. Finally, oral antibiotics are routinely administered until the drains are removed. Overall, there has been a shift towards the use of sterile ready-to-use ADM at our institution in the last few years, although this is not reflected in the ACS-NSQIP database. It is possible that some of these modalities help explain the lower SSI rates at our institution when compared to the national average. However, we recognize that the possible effect of these institutional practices is anecdotal and have not been confirmed by a rigorous trial.",

Obesity is a wellestablished risk factor for surgical complications and wound healing.

These findings corroborate those of other publications [18,19]. According to Fischer et al.

The univariate analysis allows us to infer that this patient group has a higher incidence of comorbidities that would make them more susceptible to SSIs. However, the statistically significant results of the multivariable analysis suggest that age in itself is an intrinsic risk factor or that we did not or could not control for other risk factors in our model. This finding corresponds to the findings of other previously published studies [20,21]. Shermak et al. [20], in their study of 2,156 reduction mammoplasties, found that women older than 50 years were more likely to experience infection and wound healing problems.

An association between prolonged operative time and complications is well established in the general surgery literature [22,23]. However, Procter et al. [22] show that the determinants of prolonged operative time are multifactorial; therefore, we should interpret these results with caution. In contrast, Fogarty et al.

First, this analysis was limited to 30-day outcomes and a potentially significant group of patients can present with SSIs more than 30 days after the operation. These patients may also have drains in place, theoretically increasing their risk of SSIs. Nevertheless, we would expect that patients with SSIs more than 30 days after the operation would present equally frequently at our institution and other institutions nationwide, resulting in a similar trend in SSI rates. However, including data from SSIs occurring more than 30 days after surgery might have provided us with a sufficient number of cases to evaluate SSI risk factors specific to our institution. Another limitation is selection bias in the ACS-NSQIP database. Hospital participation in NSQIP is voluntary, and although the database includes a large number of both university and private hospitals, there may be a selection bias that affects the accuracy of the data when benchmarking against national averages. In addition, only a percentage of patient cases within any given participating institution are included in the database. Although this selection is random, it does not completely eliminate bias. Finally, many important postoperative complications relevant to our patient population are not captured by the ACS-NSQIP, such as mastectomy skin flap necrosis and seroma.",

Retrospective cohort studies outside of the ACS-NSQIP database would be necessary to obtain sufficient patient numbers to benchmark SSI rates against that in the rest of the nation.
