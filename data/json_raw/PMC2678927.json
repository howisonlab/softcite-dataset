The risk alleles in the gene, however, were found to be monomorphic in two Asian populations examined: Japanese and Korean. In this study, using a collection of 910 SLE patients and 2360 controls from Chinese living in Hong Kong, analyzed by both genome-wide association and direct sequencing, we confirmed the association of the same risk alleles in ITGAM with the disease. These findings were further replicated in the Thai population with 278 patients and 383 ethnicity-and geography-matched controls. Subphenotype stratification analyses showed significantly more involvement of the gene in patients with renal nephritis and neurological disorders. Although our results support a pivotal role by rs1143679 (R77H) in disease association, our data also suggests an additional contribution from rs1143683, another non-synonymous polymorphism in this gene (A858V). Therefore, despite the low-allele frequencies of the risk alleles of the gene in our two Asian populations, ITGAM was confirmed to be a risk factor related to disease susceptibility and probably severe manifestations of SLE.",

Both strong genetic predisposing factors and environmental effects are involved in the disease, and there are apparent population differences in terms of disease prevalence and manifestations (1). Asians have a higher disease prevalence (100 patients/100 000 for women) and more renal involvement (2 -4) than Caucasians. Population differences in term of susceptibility genes were also well documented (5 -7). Identifying differences in genetic susceptibility towards the disease could shed light on the mechanisms of the disease and have implications on its clinical intervention.",

SNP rs1143679, a non-synonymous SNP that converts Arginine 77 to Histidine, showed the most significant association with the disease in Caucasians and also in two African-American populations, among many other SNPs in the gene also with significant association. The study by Nath et al. found that any haplotype carrying the risk allele at rs1143679 explained the global haplotype association. In a recent study by Han et al.

In a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we genotyped 314 SLE samples collected in Hong Kong using Illumina 550K Beadchip and analyzed the data against 920 control samples. In another setting, by direct sequencing, we genotyped four SNPs in ITGAM, namely rs1143679, rs9888739, rs1143683 and rs1143678, in 918 SLE cases and 1440 healthy controls from our Hong Kong collection as well as case -control study samples collected in Thailand.

We analyzed our case samples against 920 controls, which include 400 healthy individuals of Chinese ethnicity and 520 samples from two other studies on schizophrenia and HBV infection in Hong Kong Chinese. The allele frequencies of the ITGAM SNPs were found to be very similar in the three different control groups. In Table 1, we listed the SNPs in and around ITGAM (within 100 kb up-and down-stream of the gene) that showed significant association with the disease, together with rs11574637, the SNP that was found to be associated with SLE in the study of Hom et al. It can be seen from Figure 1 that all the five SNPs showed significant association with SLE in ITGAM have high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other. SNP rs11574637 was not associated with SLE in our population, a finding different from result reported by Hom et al. This result probably reflected the LD difference of rs11574637 with other SNPs in the ITGAM gene between the two populations (e.g. between rs1143683 and rs11574637, r 2 \u00bc 0.8 and 0.65 in Caucasians and Chinese, respectively, Fig. 1). As speculated by Hom et al. and later confirmed by two other studies (8 -10), the association seen from rs11574637 is probably due to the LD with the nonsynonymous SNPs in the ITGAM gene.",

SNP rs1143679 was not on the Illumina 550K Beadchip but was found to play a pivotal role in disease association reported by Nath et al. (10), and was therefore included for further study. In both Hong Kong samples and samples from Thailand, the association of ITGAM with SLE was confirmed (Table 2). Interestingly, the risk alleles are much lower in frequency in our populations compared with other populations, especially for the risk alleles in Hong Kong Chinese. Of the four SNPs genotyped, only rs1143683 and rs1143679 showed significant association with the disease in Hong Kong samples. The Thai samples showed much higher allele frequencies for these SNPs in the controls and significant association for all four SNPs genotyped. It seems that the risk alleles may have larger effect sizes in the Thai samples, but testing for heterogeneity of the ORs between the two populations were not significant. However, the negative result in the heterogeneity test between the two populations could be just a reflection of low power for this analysis.",

The risk alleles in the gene seem to show association only in the patients with renal nephritis but not in patients without, and comparison between patients with and without renal nephritis is significant for both rs1143683 and rs1143679 (P \u00bc 0.022 and 0.029, respectively, Table 3). Similar findings were detected for patients with neurological disorders, for which significant association were found in patients positive for the phenotype despite the small sample size (n \u00bc 46), whereas the association is marginally significant for the phenotype-negative patients (Table 3). For several other manifestations, the risk SNPs showed higher ORs in patients positive for the subphenotypes than in patients negative for them, such as on anti-dsDNA antibody, hematological disorder and immunological disorder, although patients-only analysis did not show significant difference. Interestingly, the risk alleles seem to associate with the disease in patients negative for photosensitivity. It should be noted that the significance in statistics is before correction for multiple testing, and the subphenotype stratification test is prone to both false-positive and false-negative results (see Supplementary Material, Figs S1-S2 for power calculation of this study). A definitive conclusion for subphenotype association probably requires a significant increase in sample size and/or replication work in other Asian collections.",

Although our data support a vital role for rs1143679, it seems that rs1143683, which converts alanine at position 858 of the protein to valine, may have further contribution toward disease association. On top of all the statistical analysis, we observed significant disease association from rs1143683 after excluding all the samples carrying the risk allele of rs1143679, supporting independent contribution besides rs1143679. The relative lower LD between rs1143679 and other disease-associated variants in our populations ( Fig. 1) is probably the explanation for the different findings from other populations and from our two Asian populations. It is also possible that there could be a population difference in the effect of rs1143683. The low-allele frequencies for these variants in our populations reduce the power of our study, and it will be important to have other studies reexamine the issue of independent contribution of these SNPs.",

            "text": "It seems that in our Hong Kong samples, the association is tightly related to lupus nephritis ( Table 3). The risk alleles also seem to be associated with some other severe manifestations of the disease. The confirmation of the ITGAM gene with SLE susceptibility in our two Asian populations seems convincing and consistent with previous reports from other ethnicities (8 -11). However, proving connection of the genetic variants in this gene with different manifestations will need much increased sample size and replications from other collections. Elucidating connections between genetic variations and clinical manifestations, especially severe, potentially life-threatening ones, will play crucial role in our understanding of disease mechanisms and improving clinical intervention. To reach this goal, meta-analysis from different studies is important, since it will be difficult for a single study to have the sample size needed to reach a definitive answer in stratification analysis, especially for genetic variants of low-allele frequencies. The product of ITGAM, integrin-a M (CD11b\u00fe), is a molecule that combines with integrin-b 2 to form a leukocytespecific integrin. The a M b 2 -integrin is important in the adherence of neutrophils and monocytes to stimulated endothelium and in the phagocytosis of complement-coated particles. Ligation of the complement C3 activation product iC3b to integrin-a M on antigen-presenting cells results in the production of TGFb2 and IL10, a process that is essential for the induction of tolerance (12). Molad et al. (13) reported that neutrophils from SLE patients with more active disease expressed greater CD11b/CD18 than those from controls or patients with less active disease. In addition to clearance of immune complexes, ITGAM may suppress differentiation of helper T-cell type 17 (Th17), a pathway that has been shown to be involved in autoimmunity (14,15). ITGAM deficiency may also lead to enhanced IL6 production by antigen presenting cells, which subsequently promotes preferential differentiation of na\u00efve T cells to Th17 (16).",
