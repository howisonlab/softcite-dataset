            "text": "INTRODUCTION: PXR polymorphisms have been implicated in modulating CYP3A4 and PXR expression, potentially accounting for interindividual differences in drug metabolism. The prevalence of PXR polymorphisms varies among ethnic groups and data on the allelic distribution in the highly mixed Brazilian population is lacking. The aim of this study was to analyze genetic variations in the PXR gene in Brazilians and to compare the results to other ethnic groups. METHODS: DNA samples from 117 healthy Brazilians underwent PCR amplification and sequencing. RESULTS: Eleven polymorphisms were identified, 3 of which are highly associated with differences in CYP3A4 expression. We also identified 1 new synonymous variant in 1.3% of the alleles. Among the functional polymorphisms,-25913 C.T and-6994T.C occurred at a higher frequency compared to the African alleles (p , 0.05) but at a lower frequency compared to Caucasian alleles. The 8055 C.T allele was found at a similar frequency to those described in Caucasians and Africans (p. 0.05). CONCLUSION: We observed that functional variants of the PXR were frequent in our sample of the Brazilian population. Our results suggest that PXR gene variants may be of interest in pharmacogenetic studies involving Brazilians.",

            "text": "The interindividual variability in human drug metabolism may be genetically determined by allelic variance in genes encoding P450 proteins and nuclear receptors. [1][2][3][4] Cytochrome P450s metabolize approximately 80% of clinical drugs and polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 gene have been previously investigated due to its involvement in the metabolism of more than 50% of drugs. Despite the large interindividual differences in CYP3A4 expression, polymorphisms that impair enzyme activity seem to be rare. [5][6][7] CYP3A4 expression is mainly induced by the pregnane X receptor (PXR), [8][9][10] a member of the orphan nuclear receptor subfamily and the main transcriptional regulator of cytochrome P4503A enzymes. 8,9 The activation of PXR initiates in the cytoplasm. After exposure to ligands, PXR dimerizes with the retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and binds to nuclear receptor response elements in the upstream regulatory regions of target genes. These genes encode drug-metabolizing enzymes such as CYP3A4 and drug transporters, 11 which are the main regulators in the uptake and transformation of many prescribed medicines.",

This study was carried out in order to determine the frequency of variants of the PXR gene in a sample of the Brazilian population. We found 11 polymorphisms in the PXR gene, including the 4306 C.G substitution in exon 4 that has not been previously described. This variant is not predicted to alter the splice site in exon 4 of the PXR gene and is unlikely to alter protein function.",
