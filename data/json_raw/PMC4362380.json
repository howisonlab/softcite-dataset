To overcome this limitation, Wilson Wolf Manufacturing developed the G-Rex, a cell culture flask with a gas-permeable membrane at the base that supports large media volumes without compromising gas exchange. Although this culture platform has recently gained traction with the scientific community due to its superior performance when compared with traditional culture systems, the limits of this technology have yet to be explored. In this study, we investigated multiple variables including optimal seeding density and media volume, as well as maximum cell output per unit of surface area. Additionally, we have identified a novel means of estimating culture growth kinetics. All of these parameters were subsequently integrated into a novel G-Rex \"M\" series, which can accommodate these optimal conditions. A multicenter study confirmed that this fully optimized cell culture system can reliably produce a 100-fold cell expansion in only 10 days using 1L of medium. The G-Rex M series is linearly scalable and adaptable as a closed system, allowing an easy translation of preclinical protocols into the good manufacturing practice.",

            "text": "Adoptive cell therapy is a growing field that has moved rapidly from the research setting to early phase clinical studies and has recently gained the interest of commercial entities. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] However, practical considerations such as the need to generate large cell numbers for adoptive transfer remain a challenge that limits the broader applicability of cell-based therapeutics. [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] With the purpose of overcoming this limitation, Wilson Wolf Manufacturing has developed a Gas-permeable Rapid Expansion device (G-Rex), which is essentially a flask with a gas-permeable silicone membrane at the base that allows efficient O 2 and CO 2 exchange. This configuration facilitates the addition of large media volumes per unit of surface area, thereby increasing nutrient support without compromising gas exchange. 13,19,20 We have previously demonstrated that this G-Rex platform not only supports the expansion of antigen-specific and genetically modified T cells and a range of suspension cell lines but also produces superior cell output (3-to 20-fold increase in cell numbers) with a reduction in the number of required technician interventions (~4-fold) when compared with conventional 24-well plates and flasks. 19 Moreover, these improvements in cell output are due to enhanced cell survival rather than increased proliferation, as the use of this device actually decreases the number of cell divisions required to achieve a given target cell number. 13,19 Since our initial report, a number of other cell therapy groups have confirmed our observations and extended the range of this platform. For example, Rosenberg's group (Jin et al.) showed that G-Rex devices could be used to expand tumor infiltrating lymphocytes more efficiently and at a reduced cost compared with 24-well plates. 12 Similarly, Chakraborty et al. expanded regulatory T cells in the G-Rex to numbers far in excess of those achieved using traditional tissue culture methods, 21 while Lapteva et al. demonstrated superior natural killer cell expansion using the G-Rex when compared with gas-permeable cell culture bags. 22 However, despite these impressive results, it is unclear whether the G-Rex has yet reached its full potential. To address this issue and identify the \"optimized\" culture conditions, we (i) investigated the maximal cell output per unit of surface area that could be achieved, (ii) identified the optimal initial cell seeding density (cells/cm 2 ), (iii) determined the minimum media volume required to support maximum cell output, and (iv) characterized cell growth kinetics. We then integrated these findings into the design of a novel G-Rex M series-a fully optimized cell culture platform.",

To ensure that the medium was not limiting in either condition, both cultures were replenished every 2-3 days with fresh medium, and cell growth and viability were assessed by cell counting using trypan blue exclusion. As shown in Figure 1a, even with unrestricted nutrients, cell numbers in the 24-well plates plateaued by day 6 of culture and remained relatively static thereafter, resulting in a total of 1.6 \u00b1 0.05 \u00d7 10 6 cells/cm 2 on day 14. In contrast, cell numbers in the G-Rex 10 consistently and exponentially increased from day 3 of culture, peaking on day 9 at 13.8 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10 6 cells/cm 2 and remaining relatively stable thereafter (13.0 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10 6 cells/cm 2 on day 14). Thus, expansion in the G-Rex was significantly greater than that achieved in 24-well plates with a fold change of 13.8 \u00b1 0.6 versus 1.4 \u00b1 0.06, respectively, on day 9 (n = 3; P < 0.0001) ( Figure 1b).",

Cultures received a half medium change every day (to remove medium as a potential limiting factor), and cell expansion was monitored by counting every 2-3 days over a 14-day culture period (n = 3 per condition). As shown in Figure 2a, G-Rex devices seeded at 6.25 \u00d7 10 4 cells/cm 2 remained in lag phase for an extended period of time, suggesting that a minimum threshold of cell-to-cell contact is required to support rapid cell growth. In contrast, devices seeded with cell densities ranging from 1.25 \u00d7 10 5 to 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/cm 2 yielded maximum cell numbers of ~1.38 \u00d7 10 7 cells/cm 2 by day 9 of culture (initial cells/cm 2 to maximum cells/ cm 2 : 1.25 \u00d7 10 5 to 13.7 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 10 6 ; 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 to 14.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10 6 ; 5 \u00d7 10 5 to 13.9 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 10 6 ; 1 \u00d7 10 6 to 13.8 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10 6 ). This suggests that irrespective of the initial seeding density, the maximum cell number that can be supported by the G-Rex is ~1.4 \u00d7 10 7 cells/cm 2 (Figure 2a,b). As shown in Figure 2c, the maximum fold expansion (109.76 \u00b1 3.9) was observed in the cultures initiated with 1.25 \u00d7 10 5 cells/cm 2 , which was significantly higher than that achieved in any of the other conditions tested. This indicates that, although the maximum density of K562 cells is always ~1.4 \u00d7 10 7 cells/cm 2 , cell output and fold expansion can be maximized by utilizing the lowest possible initial seeding density (1.25 \u00d7 10 5 cells/cm 2 ).",

Thus, we initiated cultures with 1.25 \u00d7 10 5 K562 cells/cm 2 and supplemented the devices (n = 3 per condition) with various medium volumes ranging from 0.5 to 20 ml/cm 2 on day 0. From that point on, medium was not replenished and culture performance was assessed daily by cell counting. As shown in Figure 3a, when using from 0.5 to 10 ml of medium per cm 2 , there was a direct correlation between volume and cell expansion. Thereafter, however, there was no benefit conferred by higher medium volumes ( Figure 3a). We next explored how best to provide this medium volume to the cells. Figure 3b shows the different feeding schedules tested, which included (i) a total of 10 ml of medium per cm 2 divided into four feedings (2.5 ml/cm 2 added on days 0, 6, 12, and 18), (ii) 10 ml provided in two feedings (5 ml/cm 2 added on days 0 and 12), and (iii) 10 ml/cm 2 added up-front. Figure 3b shows that, irrespective of the feeding schedule, the maximum cell density achieved was similar (schedule (i) 11.4 \u00b1 1.3 \u00d7 10 6 cells/cm 2 ; schedule (ii) 11.8 \u00b1 0.8 \u00d7 10 6 cells/cm 2 ; schedule (iii) 12.9 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10 6 cells/cm 2 (n = 3)). However, cultures that received all 10 ml/cm 2 of medium up-front (schedule (iii)) grew exponentially and reached their maximum cell density by day 9-10 of culture, whereas addition of medium in a staggered fashion resulted in an interrupted growth pattern where the cells fluctuated between log and lag phase growth, prolonging the time until maximal cell output was achieved. Thus, we have demonstrated that 10 ml of medium per cm 2 administered at culture setup results in the shortest time required to achieve maximum cell numbers.",

However, since the G-Rex accommodates large media volumes (e.g., 10 ml/cm 2 ), cell resuspension is challenging. To address this issue, we sought to identify an alternate marker that could be used to predict cell growth. We initiated G-Rex cultures (n = 3) using optimal conditions (1.25 \u00d7 10 5 K562 cells/cm 2 with 10 ml medium/ cm 2 ) and measured glucose in the medium by sampling 20 \u00b5l of  the culture supernatant daily using a standard glucometer. At the same time points, we resuspended the cultures and quantified cell numbers by cell counting using trypan blue exclusion. As shown in Figure 4a, the glucose concentration in the G-Rex devices progressively decreased over the culture period (250.3 \u00b1 1.5, 229.7 \u00b1 2.9, 158.3 \u00b1 0.6, 45.7 \u00b1 1.5 mg/dl on days 0, 3, 6, and 9, respectively), which inversely correlated with an increase in cell numbers determined by cell counting (0.125 \u00d7 10 6 , 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10 6 , 5.43 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10 6 , and 12.87 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10 6 cells/cm 2 on days 0, 3, 6, and 9, respectively). Based on this inverse correlation, we developed a formula to calculate cell number based solely on glucose measurements. The formula is as follows:",

We provided our optimized culture recommendations to both academic institutions (City of Hope and University of Wisconsin-Madison) and a biotech company (Celgene) and asked them to repeat our G-Rex expansion experiments. As illustrated in Figure 5b, when the group at Celgene cultured K562 cells at an initial seeding density of 1.25 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ cm 2 in a G-Rex 100M (100 cm 2 surface area) with 1L of medium (10 ml/cm 2 ), the total cell number achieved by day 12 of culture was 1.56 \u00d7 10 9 (15.6 \u00d7 10 6 cells/cm 2 , n = 1), which was similar to our  findings (12.9 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10 6 cells/cm 2 , n = 3).

As illustrated in Figure 6a, the G-Rex can operate as either an open or closed system. In order to harvest the cells expanded in the closed system G-Rex without exposing the culture to the environment, Wilson Wolf developed the \"GatheRex, \" a semiautomated system that allows the operator to drain the excess media present in the culture and collect cells without risk of contamination. The process is divided into two stages: (i) cell concentrating and (ii) cell harvesting. (Figure 7a,b) operates via an air pump which pressurizes the G-Rex device with sterile air, allowing 90% of the medium residing above the cells to be displaced into a medium collection bag. Once this process is complete, optical detector #1 senses the presence of air in the medium collection line, automatically stopping the pump. 2. Prior to beginning the harvest process, the operator must resuspend the cells using the residual 10% of the medium by manually swirling the G-Rex to dislodge cells from the gaspermeable membrane. The air pump is then reactivated, and the resuspended cells are drawn into the cell collection bag. This phase will automatically end once optical detector #2 detects air in the cell collection line.

Importantly, the optimal culture conditions, initially established in a small scale G-Rex device with a surface area of 5 cm 2 , were linearly scalable provided that initial seeding cell density and media volume were normalized by surface area.

The minimum number of cells per cm 2 required to support cell expansion is likely to differ depending on cell size, as smaller cells need a higher initial seeding density to ensure adequate cell-to-cell contact. However, once the optimal seeding density has been identified, this number remains constant for any particular cell type. Additionally, as long as nutrients are not a limiting factor, and seeding density is above the critical threshold, the maximum number of cells per cm 2 that can be obtained is the same. This finding suggests that the system can reach its maximum potential by initiating the culture with the lowest seeding density possible.",

In our previous studies, we established that the superior cell growth supported by the G-Rex was due in large part to the gas-permeable silicone membrane at the base of the device, which allows optimal exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. 12,13,19 As a result, gas exchange remains unaffected by medium height, allowing the addition of large media volumes which cannot be supported by conventional cultureware. This increased volume not only provides additional nutrients to support cell proliferation but also serves as a buffer to dilute cellular metabolic and toxic by-products. 19,20 To define the optimal media volume, we added volumes ranging from 0.5 to 20 ml/cm 2 and observed a correlation between volume and cell numbers obtained. However, this relationship plateaued at 10 ml/cm 2 , identifying this as the minimum volume required to achieve maximum cell output. Furthermore, contrary to what would be expected, the maximum cell output was achieved more rapidly (~day 10 of culture) when the entire volume of medium was provided at the initiation of the culture, rather than periodically replenished. This is likely due to the fact that an up-front medium addition delivers a steady rather than fluctuating supply of nutrients to the cells, allowing them to remain in log phase growth for a longer period of time. An additional advantage to this sole medium addition at culture initiation is the reduction in required culture manipulations and the risk of contamination, unlike conventional cultures which require frequent feeding.",

This phenomenon is likely caused by a thermal differential between the heat source (the incubator) and the medium. Therefore, due to convection, warmer medium adjacent to the walls of the G-Rex will move toward the core, displacing colder media to the periphery. This cycle is perpetuated, resulting in a homogenous mixing of the medium without disturbing the cells growing on the silicone membrane. This also has the secondary benefit of facilitating cell harvesting since as much as 90% of the medium can be removed from the G-Rex without disrupting the cell layer on the silicone base. Subsequently, the final cell product can be resuspended in a concentrated form in the small volume of remaining medium.",

            "text": "The G-Rex is the only cell culture system capable of supporting significant cell expansion (100-fold) with a single up-front addition of medium. We demonstrated this to be true not only for K562 cells but also for primary T cells genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (Supplementary Figure S1). This unique characteristic allows not only a cost-effective use of resources but also the measurement of elements within the media that predict the kinetics of cell growth. For example, we observed an inverse correlation between cell number and glucose consumption during logarithmic phase cell growth. Therefore, by measuring glucose levels at culture initiation and monitoring depletion over time, one can calculate the number of cells at any given time. Sampling medium for the assessment of nutrient and/or metabolic waste concentration is much simpler than other methods of calculating cell number, and results achieved are comparable to conventional cell counting by trypan blue exclusion or flow cytometry. Importantly, glucose concentration was the same irrespective of where the sample for analysis was drawn from, confirming the homogeneous nature of the medium in the G-Rex. The optimal G-Rex cell culture conditions identified through our study led to the design of the G-Rex M series that accommodates 10 ml/cm 2 medium. We validated the robustness of this optimized platform in a PACT-sponsored multicenter study involving both academic and commercial partners. Finally, from a commercial perspective, we demonstrated that the optimized culture conditions and results were linearly scalable and adaptable as a closed system, facilitating not only the development of novel cell therapies but also the clinical translation of cell-based therapeutics.",

Once activated (orange \u2192) (3), the clamp on the medium collection line (4) is opened while the cell collection line (14) remains closed. The G-Rex is pressurized, allowing 90% of the medium residing above the cells to be displaced through the collection port (8) and into the collection bag (9). Once this process is complete, optical detector #1 (11) senses the presence of air in the medium collection line, automatically stopping the pump. At this stage, the system is ready to initiate cell harvest. 2. Prior to beginning the harvest process, the operator must resuspend the cells using the residual 10% of the medium present in the G-Rex. Cell collection is initiated by activating the system (blue \u2192) (13), which will clamp the medium collection line and open the cell collection line (14). The pump is then reactivated, and the resuspended cells are drawn through the cell collection port into the cell collection bag (16). This phase will automatically end once optical detector #2 (18) detects air in the cell collection line. 3. (Optional) At this point, the operator may wish to \"rinse\" the G-Rex to ensure collection of residual cells in the tubing and flask. The wash is activated by opening the clamp on the media collection line (orange \u2190) allowing a portion of the medium in the collection bag to flow back into the G-Rex. Once the system is rinsed, the pump can be reactivated (blue \u2192), opening the clamp and allowing the residual cells to enter the cell collection bag.",
