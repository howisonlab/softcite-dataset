We report here that BATF (basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATFlike), an AP-1 protein family factor, is required for optimal expression of CCR9 and \ue0614\ue0627 by T helper cells. BATF-deficient (knockout [KO]) mice had reduced numbers of effector T and regulatory T cells in the intestine. The intestinal T cells in BATF KO mice expressed CCR9 and \ue0614\ue0627 at abnormally low levels compared with their wild-type (WT) counterparts, and BATF KO CD4 + T cells failed to up-regulate the expression of CCR9 and \ue0614\ue0627 to WT levels in response to RA. Defective binding of RAR\ue061 and histone acetylation at the regulatory regions of the CCR9 and Itg-\ue0614 genes were observed in BATF KO T cells. As a result, BATF KO effector and FoxP3 + T cells failed to populate the intestine, and neither population functioned normally in the induction and regulation of colitis. Our results establish BATF as a cellular factor required for normal expression of CCR9 and \ue0614\ue0627 and for the homeostasis and effector functions of T cell populations in the intestine.",

Tissuespecific migration of lymphocytes is possible through distinct expression of trafficking receptors by lymphocyte subsets. Guthoming lymphocytes preferentially express a chemokine receptor, CCR9, and an integrin, \ue0614\ue0627 (Hamann et al., 1994;Berlin et al., 1995;Abitorabi et al., 1996;Mackay et al., 1996;Zabel et al., 1999;Kunkel et al., 2000;Papadakis et al., 2000;Wurbel et al., 2000;Marsal et al., 2002;Svensson et al., 2002;Pabst et al., 2004).

Both CCR9 and \ue0614\ue0627 are induced by retinoic acid (RA), a nuclear hormone produced in the gut by retin aldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH)-expressing dendritic cells and epithelial cells (Niederreither et al., 2002;Iwata et al., 2004). It has been deter mined that expression of the \ue0614 chain of \ue0614\ue0627 is induced by RA (Kang et al., 2011). Integrin \ue0627 is constitutively expressed but can be further upregulated by TGF\ue0621 and RA (Kilshaw and Murant, 1991;Kang et al., 2011). RAR\ue061 would work together with other transcription factors such as NFATc2 to induce the expression of CCR9 by T cells (Ohoka et al., 2011). These RAinduced trafficking receptors regulate mi gration of IgAproducing B cells and effector T cells (Iwata et al., 2004;Mora and von Andrian, 2009;Wang et al., 2010). for \ue0614\ue0627 were reduced in the small intestinal LP of BATF KO mice (Fig. 2, A and B). A considerable decrease in CCR9 and \ue0614\ue0627 expression was also detected in CD8 + T cells in the small intestine but not in other organs (Fig. 2 C).",

We next examined whether BATF KO naive T cells are defective in upregulating trafficking recep tors in response to T cell activation in the presence of RA in vitro. Compared with WT CD4 + T cells, BATF KO naive T cells showed less upregulation of CCR9 in response to RA (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, BATF KO naive T cells were unable to upregulate \ue0614\ue0627 to WT levels. Similar results were ob tained with concanavalin A (Fig. 3 A) or with OVA 323-339 when OTII BATF KO T cells were used (not depicted). At the mRNA level, expression of both CCR9 and Itg-\ue0614 in re sponse to RA was defective in BATF KO T cells (Fig. 3 B). However, expression of Itg-\ue0627 mRNA by BATF KO T cells was comparable with WT T cells. We examined other chemo kine receptors such as CCR4, CCR6, CCR7, and CXCR4 ( Fig. 3 C) and did not detect any significant differences in expression of these receptors between WT and BATF KO T cells cultured with or without RA. RA enhances the induc tion of FoxP3 + T cells by TGF\ue0621 (Kang et al., 2007;Mucida et al., 2007), and this response was intact in BATF KO T cells (Fig. 3 D). However, BATF KO T regulatory cells (iT reg cells) induced with RA and TGF\ue0621 were deficient in expression of CCR9 and \ue0614\ue0627 (Fig. 3 E). These results indicate that expression of guthoming receptors in BATF KO T helper cells to RA is defective, whereas differentiation of T reg cells was normal.",

            "text": "It is possible that BATF KO T cells are defective in ex pression of CCR9 and \ue0614\ue0627 as the result of a block in cell development rather than the absence of functional BATF. This was addressed using retroviral gene complementation in BATF KO T cells. We constructed retroviral vectors expressing the fulllength and two truncated versions of BATF and used these to complement the BATF deficiency in T cells (Fig. 4 A). Enforced BATF expression induced a low level of \ue0614\ue0627 but did not induce CCR9 in the absence of exogenous RA (Fig. 4,B and C). This modest induc tion of \ue0614\ue0627 is likely caused by residual RA that is present in the culture medium. BATF KO CD4 + T cells were able to normally express CCR9 and \ue0614\ue0627 in response to RA when the fulllength BATF protein was expressed (Fig. 4, B and C). A low but detectable activity was observed for a BATF mutant deleted for the first exon (BATF\ue0442), and this was predicted because the protein retains the Jun dimeriza tion and DNAbinding domains of BATF (Fig. 4,B and C). In contrast, a nonfunctional BATF protein deleted for the first and second exons (BATF\ue0441) did not have such activities. BATF (basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATFlike) is a basic leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factor of the AP1 protein family (Dorsey et al., 1995). BATF is widely expressed in the immune system, including T and B cells. It hetero dimerizes with Jun proteins for transcriptional regulatory activity (Dorsey et al., 1995;Echlin et al., 2000;Williams et al., 2001). BATF is required for the generation of Th17 cells and TFh cells but is dispensable for development of Th1 cells and FoxP3 + T cells (Schraml et al., 2009;Betz et al., 2010;Ise et al., 2011). It has been reported that BATF can suppress Sirt1 expression and control the ATP level and effector function of CD8 + T cells (Kuroda et al., 2011). Additionally, BATF deficiency is associated with the loss of activationinduced cytidine deami nase (AID) expression and class switch recombination in B cells (Betz et al., 2010;Ise et al., 2011), and BATF recently has been shown to regulate a DNA damage-induced differentiation checkpoint important for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (Wang et al., 2012).",

One disadvantage of confocal imaging on tissue sections is that the areas viewed are limited by sectioning, and it is into specific microenvironments within an organ. To ex amine cell migration to specific tissue sites, frozen sections of the tissues were examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 6 C). We found that migration of CD4 + T cells into the small naive T cells were activated in the presence of RA, and expression of CCR9 and \ue0614\ue0627 was examined by flow cytometry. (B) Expression of the trafficking receptor genes at the mRNA by cultured CD4 + naive T cells was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. Normalized values to \ue062-actin levels are shown. (C) Expression of other chemokine receptors was examined by flow cytometry. (D) RA-dependent induction of FoxP3 + T cells in vitro from naive CD4 + T cells was examined by flow cytometry. Naive CD4 + T cells were in vitro activated with concanavalin A and IL-2 in the presence or absence of 10 nM RA for 5 d. 1 ng/ml TGF\ue0621 was added to culture. (E) Expression of CCR9 and \ue0614\ue0627 by WT and BATF KO FoxP3 + cells induced by RA and TGF\ue0621. All graphs show pooled data obtained from four experiments (*, P < 0.05). All error bars are SEM obtained from pooled data. BATF KO CD4 + T cells fail to induce inflammation in the intestine BATF KO CD4 + T cells may not effectively induce inflam mation in the intestine because of their poor migration to the tissue. We tested this possibility using the colitis model in Rag1 \ue032/\ue032 mice. Rag1 \ue032/\ue032 mice were injected with T reg celldepleted naive CD4 + T cells isolated from WT or BATF KO mice. Naive BATF KO CD4 + T cells did not decrease the weight of Rag1 \ue032/\ue032 mice as effectively as WT T cells ( Fig. 8 A). Histological examination revealed only mild inflammation in the Rag1 \ue032/\ue032 mice injected with naive BATF KO CD4 + T cells (Fig. 8 B). This is in contrast to the severe inflamma tion seen in both the proximal and distal colon of the Rag1 \ue032/\ue032 mice injected with naive WT T cells. The numbers of Th1 cells, which are the major effector T cells to induce inflamma tion in this model, were decreased in the colon of Rag1 \ue032/\ue032 mice injected with naive BATF KO CD4 + T cells (Fig. 8 C). The specific decrease of Th1 cells in the colon indicates that BATF is required for Th1 effector T cell population in the in flamed gut tissue. Also decreased were the numbers of Th17 and T reg cells in the colon and the small intestine ( Fig. 8 C). This decrease in Th17 cell numbers in all tissues, including the spleen, is in line with the previous reports demonstrating that BATF KO T cells are impaired in their ability to differentiate into Th17 cells (Schraml et al., 2009;Betz et al., 2010). Over all, these results demonstrate the defective population and in flammatory function of BATF KO T cells in the intestine. often difficult to locate tissue sites such as small lymphoid patches in the intestine. To overcome this issue, we used multiphoton microscopy to image wholemounted tis sues ( Fig. 6 D). Using this technique, we confirmed that the migration of BATF KO T cells into the small intestine and colon was severely compromised. Additionally, we found that migration of RAconditioned BATF KO T cells to both colonic patches and PPs was defective as well. Threedimensional (3D) images of the differential migration into the indicated wholemounted tissues are shown in Videos 1-3.",

RAtreated BATF KO iT reg cells were not as effective as WT T reg cells in suppressing the weight loss induced by the inflammatory with WT T cells in loss of CD62L and upregulation of CD69 in response to antiCD3/28 + IL2 (Fig. 9 A). Moreover, BATF KO CD4 + T cells did not display significant differ ences in cell death after T cell activation (Fig. 9 B). Expansion of OTII CD4 + T cells after parenteral immunization was also largely intact (Fig. 9 C). Similarly, homeostatic CD4 + T cell expansion in lymphopenic Rag1 \ue032/\ue032 mice was slightly de creased but was not defective (Fig. 9 D). Absolute numbers of BATF KO CD4 + T cells in the spleen and PLN were comparable with WT, but the numbers in the intestinal LP and the intestinedraining LN (MLN) were decreased as expected (Fig. 9 E). These results indicate that general cell processes such as cell activation, death, and proliferation ap pear largely intact in BATF KO T cells. . Defective migration of BATF KO CD4 + T cells into the intestine. (A) WT and BATF KO CD4 + T cells were activated with RA for 5 d and then added to the upper chamber in a Transwell assay. 3 \u00b5g/ml CCL25 was added to the lower chamber, and the cells in the lower chamber were counted after 3 h. The data are shown as percent net migration after normalization to input cells and subtraction of the background migration rates. (B) WT and BATF KO CD4 + T cells were activated for 5-6 d with concanavalin A, IL-2, and RA and were then differentially labeled with CFSE and TRITC. The cells were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and injected i. important not only for effector T cells in inducing intestinal inflammation but also for T reg cells in controlling inflammation. The findings implicate BATF as a key regulator of T cellmediated immune responses and inflammation in the intestine.",

The CCR9 ligand, CCL25 (also called TECK), is highly expressed in the epithelial cells of the small intestine (Kunkel et al., 2000). CCR9 deficiency leads to de fective homing of memory T cells into the small intestinal LP (Stenstad et al., 2006). \ue0614\ue0627 is required for migration into the whole intestine because its adhesion receptor, MAdCAM1, is expressed on intestinal endothelial cells (Sigmundsdottir and Butcher, 2008). MAdCAM1 is expressed also on the activity of WT T cells (Fig. 10 B). Histological examination revealed that only WT iT reg cells, but not BATF KO iT reg cells, effectively suppressed colitis (Fig. 10 C). BATF KO iT reg cells were also less effective than WT iT reg cells in decreasing the number of CD45.1 + (WT naive T cell derived) Th1 effector cells in the MLN and colon (Fig. 10 D). Th17 cells, which are generally suppressed by Th1 cells, were reciprocally increased with injection of WT iT reg cells but not with BATF KO iT reg cells. Fewer CD45.2 + BATF KO iT reg cells than WT iT reg cells were found in the colon but not in the MLN of the Rag1 \ue032/\ue032 mice (Fig. 10 E), indicating defective population of the transferred BATF KO iT reg cells in the colon but not in the MLN in the inflammatory condition. Overall, these results demonstrate that BATF is required for the in vivo population of T reg cells in the gut and their regulatory activity on the Th1 cell activity and tissue inflammation.",

BATF inhibits expression of the nicotinamide adenine di nucleotide (NAD + )-dependent deacetylase Sirt1, which in turn results in increased Tbet expression (Kuroda et al., 2011). In contrast, BATF has been shown to be associated with tran scriptional activation of several genes in Th17 cells and with the induction of AID (Schraml et al., 2009;Ise et al., 2011). BATF and IRF4 can cooperate to induce the IL10, IL-17a, and IL-21 genes in T cells and to regulate the development In an inflammatory condition, BATF KO effector Th1 cells and FoxP3 + T cells failed to populate the colon. These results suggest that BATF is important for the generation of func tionally competent effector and suppressor T cells with a nor mal gut migratory capacity. Although this study focuses on the migration aspect, BATF is known to have additional func tions in regulation of T cell function. Although BATF is not required to generate Th1 cells and FoxP3 + T cells, BATF is required to generate Th17 cells and TFh cells. It has been re ported that BATF is required for generation of effector CD8 + T cells (Kuroda et al., 2011) and for a check point in the self renewal of hematopoietic stem cells in response to DNA damage (Wang et al., 2012). Thus, other phenotypes of BATF KO mice in addition to the migration defect could contrib ute to the ineffective function of effector and suppressor T cells in control of tissue inflammation in the intestine. Nevertheless, we did confirm that the basic activation, survival, and expansion . BATF KO T cells are largely intact in activation, survival, and proliferation. (A-E) WT and BATF KO CD4 + T cells were examined in vitro for activation (A) and survival (B) and in vivo for proliferation (C-E). T cells were activated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and IL-2 for 4 d, and expression of CD69 and CD62L (A) and cell death based on staining with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI; B) were examined. (C) CD45.1 mice were injected i.v. with 10 million CFSE-labeled WT or BATF KO OT-II CD4 + T cells and were immunized i.p. with OVA in complete Freund's adjuvant. CFSE dilution was examined by flow cytometry 5 d later. (D) Rag1 \ue032/\ue032 mice were injected i.v. with 10 million CFSE-labeled WT or BATF KO CD4 + T cells. The host mice were examined 14 d later for CFSE dilution. (E) Absolute numbers of WT and BATF KO CD4 + T cells expanded in the indicated organs of Rag1 \ue032/\ue032 mice are shown. Pooled data obtained from three experiments are shown in the graphs (n \u2265 10/group). All error bars are SEM obtained from pooled data. Significant differences from WT groups are shown (*, P < 0.05).",

Batf \ue044Z/\ue044Z mice with the third exon deleted in the Batf gene have been described previously (Betz et al., 2010) and will be referred to as BATF KO mice in this article. C57BL/6 mice breeding pairs were purchased from Harlan. BATF KO mice were backcrossed on the C57BL/6 back ground for >10 generations. Congenic CD45.1 C57BL/6, OTII (C57BL/6 Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J), and Rag1 \ue032/\ue032 mice (B6.129S7Rag1tm1Mom/J) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. OTII mice were crossed to BATF KO mice to generate OTII BATF KO mice. All mice used in this study were maintained at Purdue University, and experiments were per formed according to approved protocols by the Purdue University Animal Care and Use Committee. Generally, the mice were used between 6 and 8 wk of age at the start of each experiment. of CD8\ue061 + dendritic cells (Glasmacher et al., 2012;Li et al., 2012;Tussiwand et al., 2012). Several BATF and RAR\ue061 binding sites are present in the 5\ue039 regulatory regions of the CCR9 and Itg-\ue0614 genes. With one exception, all of these bind ing sites on the CCR9 gene and all of the BATFbinding sites on the Itg-\ue0614 gene do not possess the features of AP1-IRF composite elements, suggesting that the expression of the guttrafficking receptors would likely involve a different reg ulatory mechanism. Histone modification by acetylation is critical for chromatin remodeling for gene expression in re sponse to nuclear hormone receptor ligands (Rosenfeld et al., 2006). Our results indicate that RAR binding and histone acetylation at the CCR9 and Itg\ue0614 genes are important for expression of the guthoming receptors and are regulated by BATF. The detailed interaction underlying the regulation of the trafficking receptor genes will require further study as it may involve cross talk between BATF and the RAR expression Figure 10.

BATF KO and WT iT reg cells were prepared in vitro from naive CD4 + T cells through activation with concanavalin A in the presence of TGF\ue0621 and 10 nM RA for 6 d.
