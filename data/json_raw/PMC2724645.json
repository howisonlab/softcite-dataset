Materials and Methods: Alginate impressions of the upper jaw were obtained from forty Caucasian patients. Impressions were cast using hard dental stone. The teeth on each upper study model (canine to canine) were marked along the facial axis of the clinical crown (FACC line) then separated using a very thin diamond disc. Each tooth was mounted on a glass slide using sticky wax and cut into two halves down this FACC line. Images were acquired of the sections and a straight line connecting the gingival margin and the incisal edge was drawn on the flat cut surfaces (now the proximal crosssectional view). From this line, perpendicular lines were drawn at the mid-point and most prominent point to the labial curve. Coincidence rate was calculated or whether the most prominent point was gingival or incisal to the mid-point. Results: Approximately 80% of upper central incisors had coincident mid-and most-prominent points. Upper lateral incisors and canine teeth had approximately 50% coincidence. The vast majority of cases without coincidence showed the most-prominent point incisal to the mid-point for all tooth kinds with just 5% or less gingival. Conclusions: The high proportions of non-coincident examples found suggest that clinicians should be aware of individual variation and that this may possibly effect 3 rd order alignment.",

            "text": "Modern orthodontics has been described as the creation of the finest occlusal relationship within the framework of acceptable facial aesthetics and stability of occlusal result [1]. This requires positioning the crown of each individual tooth in its appropriate position for optimum function and appearance. Straight-wire appliances were designed to reduce or eliminate the need for placing bends in fully engaged straight arch wires. Andrews [2] studied the average torque angles, rotation angles, height and depth of each facial surface of each tooth type from untreated and treated patients having excellent occlusion. He found that when the brackets are precisely positioned at the midpoint of the facial axis and aligned with the facial axis, they collectively become the appliance providing specific tip, torque, rotation angle, height and depth position for each tooth. Limitations have been found in the effectiveness of this bracket system due to several factors, the most important of which is inaccurate bracket positioning [3]. This inaccuracy can only partly be blamed on clinician error as positioning the brackets on the mid-point should ideally be the same location as the mostprominent point [2] to ensure the desired torque effects and tooth movement. These points, however, do not always coincide and in fact may vary around each other to a large degree.",

Any missing teeth, supernumerary teeth or other abnormalities were also noted. From the one hundred and fifty patients, forty fulfilled the following inclusion/ exclusion criteria: all patients were of Caucasian origin, aged between 13-16 years, had fully erupted upper incisor and canine teeth, good oral hygiene, with a healthy gingival margin around the upper anterior teeth, intact teeth e.g. no restorations, attrition or abrasion, mild or no crowding in the anterior region and the cases did not exhibit any abnormality of tooth number, form or structure and no medical or other health problems.

The upper anterior teeth on each study model (canine to canine) were marked along the facial axis of the clinical crown FACC line [4], with a thin pencil (size 0.3 mm). The FACC line was located manually using electronic callipers accurate to 0.01mm (Mitutoyo, Japan). A pencil line was placed down the centre of the labial surface to pass through 2 marks made halfway between the calliper widths at 2 different positions down the crown length. A line was then drawn through these points to meet with the gingival margin in one direction and the incisal edge in the other direction (Fig. 1). The teeth were individually separated using a very thin diamond disc (Microslice II precision slicing machine, Malvern Instrument, England) with a round annular blade having the cutting surface on the inner edge. The blade was approximately 17.5cm in diameter and 0.3mm thick. Each tooth was mounted on a glass slide using red wax and yellow sticky wax. The labial tooth surface was aligned parallel to the glass slide, so that the FACC line was perpendicular to the slide edge to aid alignment for cutting the tooth along this line. Information for later identification was added to each slide prior to cutting. The slides were placed on the platform beneath the cutting disc and adjusted such that the pencil line was parallel to the cutting edge of the blade. The platform of the machine was adjustable (0.01mm steps) facilitating precise position-ing of the slide. Red and green marker spots were used for identifying the mesial and distal portion of each sectioned tooth and included in subsequent imaging.",

            "text": "Previous research studies have investigated the variation of tooth morphology and its relationship to bracket positioning. Variation in labial tooth surface morphology affects the angle at which a bracket may be seated in relation to the facial axis of the clinical crown. It has been presumed, in respect of bracket placement, that the mid-points and mostprominent points are coincident on the labial surface of anterior teeth [4,9]. This study has shown, for the first time that these two points show coincidence at approximately 80% on central incisors reducing to approximately 50% on lateral incisors and canines. This means that on approximately 20% of central incisors and 50% of laterals and canines, brackets will be placed at the mid-point of the labial curve when it is not the most-prominent point. In this situation the labial curve is not symmetrical vertically about the mid-point such that the bracket will not sit in the preferred position parallel to the proximal line (facial axis of the clinical crown) as mentioned by Andrews [2]. This situation could introduce axial forces affecting the inclination of these teeth (3 rd order correction) and increase the need for extra final adjustment after initial alignment. Our data is in agreement with previous tooth morphology studies on labial surface variation [10][11][12][13][14][15] but provides extra specific information regarding midand most-prominent point coincidence and location. This study only considered class 1 relationships from patients requiring minor adjustments only to the lower dentition. The size and shape of a tooth will obviously affect the amount of torgue/ force required but the effect of each measurement variation would require a separate study. This paper and study discuss' the effect of the curvature of the tooth surface and therefore difference between the mid and most prominent points only.",
