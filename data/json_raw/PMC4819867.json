            "text": "Background/Aims To employ an experimental model of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in healthy human volunteers, and evaluate the impact of opioid treatment compared to placebo on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and motility assessed by questionnaires and regional GI transit times using the 3-dimensional (3D)-Transit system. Methods Twenty-five healthy males were randomly assigned to oxycodone or placebo for 5 days in a double blind, crossover design. Adverse GI effects were measured with the bowel function index, gastrointestinal symptom rating scale, patient assessment of constipation symptom questionnaire, and Bristol stool form scale. Regional GI transit times were determined using the 3D-Transit system, and segmental transit times in the colon were determined using a custom Matlab \u00ae graphical user interface. Results GI symptom scores increased significantly across all applied GI questionnaires during opioid treatment. Oxycodone increased median total GI transit time from 22.2 to 43.9 hours (P < 0.001), segmental transit times in the cecum and ascending colon from 5.7 to 9.9 hours (P = 0.012), rectosigmoid colon transit from 2.7 to 9.0 hours (P = 0.044), and colorectal transit time from 18.6 to 38.6 hours (P = 0.001). No associations between questionnaire scores and segmental transit times were detected. Conclusions Self-assessed GI adverse effects and increased GI transit times in different segments were induced during oxycodone treatment. This detailed information about segmental changes in motility has great potential for future interventional head-to-head trials of different laxative regimes for prevention and treatment of constipation.",

            "text": "Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects are common in opioid treated patients and collectively referred to as opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD). 1,2 They result from binding of exogenous opioids to opioid-receptors in the enteric nervous system, consequently disturbing normal GI function and manifesting in symptoms including gastroesophageal reflux, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, anorexia, hard stools, constipation, and incomplete evacuation. 3 Severe adverse effects are often the reason patients discontinue opioid treatment, which naturally results in inadequate pain management. 4,5 As the prescription of opioids has increased several fold in Europe and the US recent years, an increase in adverse effects to opioid treatment has expectedly also developed. 6 Current assessments of OIBD typically rely on self-assessed questionnaires primarily focusing on constipation. 7,8 The most commonly used questionnaires include assessment of number of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs), the patient assessment of constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM) questionnaire, 9 the bowel function index (BFI), 10 and the Bristol stool form scale (BSFS). 11 Despite elaborate focus on constipation, which is often defined as a reduction in number of SBMs, infrequent bowel movement ranks number 5 in self-assessed constipation symptoms, whereas symptoms such as gas, straining, and abdominal discomfort are far more prevalent. 12 This finding strongly emphasizes that focusing on SBMs is inadequate to describe the complete burden of OIBD. Furthermore, other health-related risk factors such as reduced mobility, age, low-fiber diet, gender, and different drugs may also contribute to the collective GI symptomatology in opioid treated patients. 13 The clinical presentation of OIBD is the result of decreased motility, decreased secretion, and dyscoordination of sphincter function in the GI tract. 14 It has previously been shown, using invasive peroral cecal intubation and serial scintigrams, that subcutaneously administered morphine delays cecum and ascending colon transit and progression of the geometric center. 15 However, reliable and minimally-invasive objective measures of OIBD are warranted in order to achieve a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and evaluate the effect of novel pharmacological treatments on motility patterns. An attractive means of quantifying gut motility is the 3-dimensional (3D)-Transit system. This is a recently introduced, minimally-invasive, ambulatory system which--using a body-borne detection matrix--simultaneously tracks the precise position and general orientation of an electromagnetic capsule from ingestion to expulsion. [16][17][18][19] Hence, the pan-enteric impact of opioid treatment can be accurately assessed, providing new insight into altered motility patterns. 20 However, opioid treated patients often suffer from comorbidities and concomitant drug use, which complicates evaluation of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Consequently, an experimental model in healthy volunteers, where these limitations are minimized, is highly merited.",

To confirm expulsion of the capsule by loss of signal on the 3D-Transit recording, subjects were instructed to register the exact time of defecation during the study periods. Total GI transit time was defined as the time between ingestion and expulsion of the capsule. If the capsule was not expelled by day 5, the recording was stopped, and the time of the last confirmed signal from the capsule was used as the earliest possible expulsion time. Based on previously validated principles, regional transit times were determined in the 3D-Transit analysis software from changes in contraction frequencies observed on the capsule rotation graphs, the time-frequency map for the recording, and 2D overview of capsule position. 18 Gastric emptying was defined as the time from ingestion until pyloric passage, the latter identified as a shift from approximately 3 contractions per minute (cpm) to 12 cpm, in combination with the characteristic 2D image of passage through the duodenal arch. As the ingestion time for the first dose of oxycodone and ingestion time of the 3D-Transit capsule was only 15 minutes apart, gastric emptying was not analysed in this study, as the short time interval did not allow for oxycodone to be sufficiently absorbed and induce OIBD in the gastric segment. Small intestinal transit time was defined as the time between pyloric passage and ileocecal passage. Ileocecal passage was identified as a decrease in contraction frequency from 6 cpm, characteristic of the distal ileum, to 3 cpm, typical of the colon. Identification of ileocecal passage was supported by a rapid lateral movement in the lower right quadrant. Total colorectal transit time was defined as the time between ileocecal passage and expulsion of the capsule.",

Particularly interesting was that not only the constipation dimension of the GSRS but also the abdominal pain dimension increased. Of special note are the daily assessed PAC-SYM scores, revealing a progressively constipating effect with significant increases on day 4 and 5--both during oxycodone treatment when compared to placebo, but also within the oxycodone arm when compared to day 2. In agreement, stool form score decreased for all days during oxycodone treatment compared to placebo, but SBM frequency only decreased on day 2 in the oxycodone arm compared to placebo. The 3D-Transit system added interesting insights in regional transit times during oxycodone treatment. It has previously been shown that intravenous morphine increases oro-cecal transit evaluated by breath tests. 28 The current data is supported by a comprehensive study by Kaufman et al, 15 who showed that subcutaneously administered morphine decreases transit in the cecum and ascending colon as well as geometric center transit. However, fewer subjects underwent a highly invasive method with peroral cecal intubation in this study, where only fluid meals were allowed, and the subjects were subjected to a series of scintigrapic images, consequently exposing them for radiation. Thus, clinical studies investigating colonic transit in response to for example, pharmacological interventions, necessitate less invasive methods such as the ambulatory and minimally-invasive nature of the 3D-Transit system.",

            "text": "The significantly prolonged transit during opioid treatment in the cecum and ascending colon, but not in the transverse and descending colon, indicates that the origin of pathophysiological motility is in this colonic segment. The analysis software for the 3D-Transit system is still in its infancy, but the current system is able to provide precise anatomical position of ingested capsules, description of contractile activity and luminal progression through well-defined regions of the GI tract. 20 An alternative, but invasive, method to examine colonic motility patterns is high-resolution fiber-optic manometry. 29 A recent study employing this technique in slow transit constipation patients found that the normal increase in the postprandial propagating cyclic motor pattern was absent in patients when compared to healthy controls. 30 Similar studies in slow transit constipation patients have found a reduced daily frequency of high amplitude propagating sequences (also recognised as mass movements and responsible for a significant proportion of propulsive activity in the colon), and that all high amplitude propagating sequences originate in the proximal colon. 29,31,32 It is therefore plausible that the prolonged colonic transit times during oxycodone treatment in this study share-at least partly-pathophysiological characteristics with slow transit constipation, and that further development of the 3D-Transit software could elucidate this neglected, yet important aspect of GI motility. Along the same line, the increased transit in the rectosigmoid colon during oxycodone treatment could indicate that not only transit, but possibly also defecation, is affected. This may be an indirect consequence of prolonged transit leading to increased passive absorption, resulting in harder, dryer stools, which are difficult to pass. In addition, the recto-anal inhibitory reflex has also been found to be inhibited during opioid administration further complicating defecation. 33 No difference in small intestinal transit was observed, but as previous studies have been contradictory, methodological refinements are likely needed to report consistent findings. [34][35][36] Recent in vitro studies in rodents has demonstrated tolerance to opioids in the upper, but not the lower GI tract. 37,38 Therefore differences in tolerance may partly explain our findings although direct translation to human in vivo physiology is highly questionable. 39 No associations between questionnaire scores and transit times were found. At first, this may seem surprising, but could reflect that the clinical presentation of OIBD is multi-faceted and the self-assessed symptoms are highly subjective, and does not always correspond with the objective findings. This is underscored in a study by Bell et al, 40 who found that many opioid-treated patients report normal stool frequency, but still experience symptoms of OIBD, and Johanson and Kralstein 12 who found that infrequent bowel movement ranks only number 5 in self-assessed constipation symptoms. Moreover, stool frequency correlates poorly with both measured whole-gut and colonic transit time, and only a modest correlation between GI transit and stool form exists in chronic constipated patients. 41 This strongly accentuates the limitations of studies using number of SBMs as the primary outcome measure, as it may potentially underestimate symptoms regarded more bothersome for the patient. Our study supports these results, as SBM frequency only changed on day 2, but other OIBD symptoms were present throughout the study along with the significant increased transit times in the colon.",

            "text": "A major advantage of our study is the use of healthy volunteers. In a clinical setting, factors known to affect bowel function such as immobility, concomitant drug use, dehydration, anorexia, previous GI surgery, haemorrhoids, but also psychological factors such as depression and anxiety can influence the outcome, and hence it can be difficult to evaluate the contribution of the variable of interest-in this case oxycodone. 42 By applying an experimental model, where these factors are controlled, this allows us to examine the underlying pathophysiology and development of GI symptoms during oxyco-done treatment with low risk of confounding and bias. Of course, a model like this should be validated in a clinical setting. Due to ethical reasons we chose only to treat the volunteers for 5 days. Despite this, our results clearly show that significant changes in bowel function and GI adverse effects could be induced. It is therefore plausible, that a longer treatment and/or higher dose would have resulted in even more pronounced symptoms. This scenario would also be more similar to the typical opioid treated patient. Moreover, a chronic pain condition may also result in a more sedentary lifestyle, known to negatively affect bowel function. 43 The lack of gastric emptying data could influence the transit time and upper gut function during oxycodone treatment, but due to the logistics in study design these were not valid. Furthermore, the loss of data due to technical problems and faulty capsules resulting in 19 subjects with full recordings for all GI regions was unfortunate, as this, combined with the wide intra-and inter-individual variation in transit times, hampers the possibility to detect significant differences. Capsule retention on day 5 in 7 recordings affected precise calculations of colorectal and total GI transit times. As it occurred in 6 recordings during oxycodone treatment, but only once in the placebo period, it has resulted in a systematic underestimation of colorectal and total GI transit time during oxycodone treatment. Also, one could argue that the use of only male volunteers in our study restricts external validity. The reason for this was to avoid potential confounding on GI symptoms and function due to the female menstrual cycle. [44][45][46] As functional constipation is also more prevalent among women than men, 47 and if opioid-induced constipation and (slow-transit) functional constipation share pathophysiological mechanisms, it is not unlikely that the prevalence of GI adverse effects due to opioid treatment would be equally frequent in women.",
