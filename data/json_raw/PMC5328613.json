            "text": "This study aimed to explore the diagnostic and prognostic values of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in breast cancer. Between September 2009 and October 2011, a total of 143 breast cancer patients and 161 healthy people were selected as case group and control group, respectively. After the identification of lesions by conventional ultrasound, all patients underwent CEUS. The CEUS images were analyzed, and time-intensity curves (TICs) were obtained. Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry staining was performed on tissue specimens, according to which the expressions of estrogen receptor (ER), c-erb-B2, p53, and Ki-67 were measured. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to compare CEUS and TIC parameters between the two groups. Compared with the control group, cancer patients showed high enhancement, heterogeneous enhancement or defects in the central region, expansion of lesion diameter after enhancement and crab-like blur lesion edges. The peak intensity (PI), relative start time of enhancement, relative PI, and relative area under the curve in the case group were significantly higher than those in the control group. Logistic analysis showed that the uniformity of enhancement, expansion of lesion diameter, and relative PI were significant diagnostic parameters of breast cancer, with area under the curve being 0.798, 0.776, and 0.919, respectively. There were strong associations between CEUS characteristics and expressions of prognostic factors in breast cancer: the heterogeneous enhancement was common in c-erb-B2positive tumors; the centripetal enhancement occurred more in ER-negative tumors; perforator vessels were often seen in tumors at high histological grade; perfusion defects were common in ER-negative, c-erb-B2-positive, and Ki-67-positive tumors. CEUS is a useful tool for the early diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer.",

            "text": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disorder and currently is the most common malignancy in females. 1 Systemic symptoms of breast cancer generally include hot flashes, insomnia, and mood changes, while its local symptoms include urogenital atrophy and vaginal dryness. 2 So far, the etiology of breast cancer has not been fully understood, but it was discovered that the development of breast cancer is associated with genetic and environmental factors as well as obesity, while hormone replacement therapy may also lead to breast cancer. [3][4][5] At present, traditional methods, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy, are typically used to determine the staging of breast cancer, but they are associated with high cost and technical complexity. 6 A new technology named contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) provides an earlier assessment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as providing a prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficiency. 7 By using the first generation of contrast agents, CEUS increases the Doppler signal, the display of blood flow and reveals perfusion characteristics in tumor. 8 In combination with high-resolution ultrasound equipment and improved ultrasound contrast agents, CEUS has been helpful in studies of tumor angiogenesis on the microcirculation level. 8 CEUS is more sensitive to hypoperfusion in normal and abnormal tissues compared with conventional Doppler ultrasound, and is an effective, as well as noninvasive diagnostic tool for disease detection. 9 CEUS uses abnormal blood perfusion or blood vessel filling patterns to diagnose a disease. 10 It is also a topical drug delivery method and has been applied in the treatment of prostate cancer, in which CEUS could use the contrast imaging to timely evaluate treatment efficacy, guide the fiber placement, adjust to appropriate therapy, and ensure its safety and efficiency. 11 However, there are few studies that have explored the application of CEUS in the diagnosis of breast cancer. This article studied whether CEUS can help the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer.",

Patients were lying in a supine position with bilateral upper limbs pointing up to fully expose their breasts and bilateral axillae. The conventional ultrasound mode was first used to examine both breasts from the edge of breast to the nipple in a continuous scanning pattern. The nipple was considered as the center, followed by the entire breast being scanned in a clockwise direction starting from the outer quadrant. Multislice scanning was focused on suspicious lesions, and the results were compared with the contralateral breast. The lesion location, shape, size, border profile, and internal echo were recorded and compared with the surrounding tissues. CEUS of lesions were performed using two equipments: the iU22 color Doppler ultrasound machine (Philips, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and the Mylab Twice color Doppler ultrasound machine (Esaote, Switzerland). The probe type and frequency of the iU22 machine were L9-3 linear array and 7.5 MHz, respectively, and pulse-inversion harmonic imaging with a mechanical index of 0.06-0.08 was used. The Mylab Twice machine used a linear array probe with a frequency of 7.5 MHz, in which contrast-tuned imaging with a mechanical index of 0.06-0.08 was adopted. After changing to the CEUS mode, the diluted SonoVue contrast agent (Bracco, Italy) was continuously shaken for 30 s, and 4.8 mL of which was injected into the median cubital vein of each patient. Next, 5 mL of normal saline was used to wash the injection syringe. Then the scanning direction was adjusted again so that the image could capture both the tumor and the surrounding normal tissues, followed by shaking of the diluted SonoVue, a second vein injection of 3 mL SonoVue to patients, washing with 5 mL of saline, and 3 min CEUS imaging. Finally, the SonoVue was transferred into the ultrasound machines.",

Using pathological results as a gold standard, multivariate logistic regression analysis was done for parameters obtained in CEUS and quantitative parameters of TIC, and constant value (B), standard error (SE), Wald chi-square value, degrees of freedom (df), P-value (significant), and odds ratio value were calculated. Using the control group and the case group as dependent variables, the above parameters showing significances were processed by forward stepwise binary logistic analyses. After obtaining the logistic regression equation, the predictive value of each parameter was determined. The optimal threshold was set by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the survival time of patients was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the survival rates of patients were compared by the log-rank test. The relative risk of clinical parameters to the prognosis was evaluated by multivariate Cox regression analysis.

This study found that the lesions of breast cancer were highly and heterogeneously enhanced, sometimes with central defects, whose diameters were enlarged and edges became crab-like and blurry. CEUS is a functional imaging technique that provides important diagnostic information and has become an alternative method of enhanced computed tomography and other imaging methods. 15 In combination with SonoVue, CEUS has shown high performance in detecting both large and small vascularities. 16 It has been shown that CEUS can illustrate the vascular perfusion inside and around the breast cancer tissues as well as showing small defects undetected by magnetic resonance imaging. 17 Furthermore, CEUS was found to provide a high diagnostic accuracy in detecting metastatic sentinel lymph node in breast cancer. 18 In addition, Saracco has shown that CEUS can help distinguish benign from malignant tumors, taking shorter time to reach PI in tumors with higher histological grades and quicker transit of contrast agent. 19 In this study, the logistic regression analysis and relevant ROC evaluation found that heterogeneous enhancement, lesion diameter expansion, and relatively high enhancement were all significant diagnostic factors for breast cancer. In addition, the diagnostic values of lesion enhancement, while positive c-erb-B2 was more likely to present heterogeneous enhancement and be seen in high histological grade. Centripetal enhancement pattern was more common in ER-negative tumors. The perforator vessels occurred mainly in tumors in high histological grade, and perfusion defects commonly occurred in ER-negative, c-erb-B2-positive, and Ki-67-positive tumors in high or medium histological grades whose diameter was .2 cm. The enhancement shape and enhancement margin of tumors were not related to prognostic factors (all P.0.05). The distributions of CEUS characteristics and prognostic factors in breast cancer are displayed in Table 5.    ultrasound imaging were superior to conventional ultrasound time-intensity analysis for breast cancer, as suggested by the ROC results. This study also found that CEUS parameters were related to the expressions of prognostic factors, including c-erb-B2, ER, and Ki-67. c-erb-B2 (also known as HER-2/ neu) is a proto-oncogene located on chromosome 17q, whose overexpression and amplification is related to neoplastic transformation, progression, and poor prognosis in breast cancer. 20,21 The ER-positive cases in all breast cancers are ~60% and the prognosis of ER-negative breast cancer is poor. 22 Ki-67 is a prognostic indicator in early breast cancer, is a nuclear antigen present in all proliferating cells, and its positive expression indicates an active proliferation of tumor cells; its high expression is also correlated with lymph node metastasis. 23 It was shown that c-erb-B2 was positive in 50.96% of malignant breast lesions, and the positive expression of this gene was associated with high enhancement in imaging. 24 The defects in vascular perfusion are common in ER-negative tumors. 24 Another study has shown that the concentric mode of enhancement was common in ER-negative tumors, and perfusion defects were generally seen in tumors with negative ER expression, positive c-erb-B2 expression, and positive Ki-67 expression, 25 which were consistent with this study.",
