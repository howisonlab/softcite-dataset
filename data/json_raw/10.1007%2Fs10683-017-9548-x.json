            "text": "Studies of experimental and betting markets have shown that markets are able to efficiently aggregate information dispersed over many traders. We study information aggregation in Arrow-Debreu markets using a novel information structure. Compared to previous studies, the information structure is more complex, allows for heterogeneity in information among traders-which provides insights into the way in which information is gradually disseminated in the market-and generates situations in which all traders hold identical beliefs over the traded assets' values, thus providing a harsh stress test for belief updating. We find little evidence for information aggregation and dissemination in early rounds. Nonetheless, after traders gain experience with the market mechanism and structure, prices converge to reveal the true state of the world. Elicited post-market beliefs reveal that markets are able to efficiently aggregate dispersed information even if individual traders remain uninformed, consistent with the marginal trader hypothesis.",

            "text": "The idea that markets can aggregate dispersed private information into prices is central to much of economic thinking. 1 When some traders are fully informed about the true state of the world, competitive bidding will push prices to reflect the true state, thus revealing the information to uninformed traders. A more challenging case is when each trader only holds partial information about the true state. If traders understand how the different pieces of information affect behaviour, the movement of prices eventually reveals the information held by other traders. Furthermore, if traders continuously condition their market demands on their own information, then market prices should continuously move until no trader can learn any more from the prices. 2 Naturally, whether equilibrium market prices fully reveal the true state depends on the information structure. Radner (1979) showed that prices converge to an equilibrium as if each trader openly and truthfully communicates his own private information. This result, however, requires that traders hold diverse or heterogeneous partial private information and that the true state is in the unique element within the intersect of at least two different private information. 3 This analysis equates the states of the world with beliefs over the traded assets' possible valuations. It remains an open question, therefore, whether market prices are able to fully reveal the true state even when traders hold identical or homogeneous partial private information, in the sense that it induces the same beliefs over asset valuations. This paper studies the information aggregation properties of markets in a novel design that allows us to clearly distinguish between situations where traders hold homogeneous and heterogeneous partial private information about the true state of the world.",

            "text": "Empirical studies suggest that the intricate process of information aggregation (e.g., learning about the information of others through price movements) postulated by theory often places too many demands on the abilities of the traders [see De-Bondt and Thaler (1985), Thaler (1988), Hirshleifer (2001) and Shleifer (2000)]. However, identifying 'who knows what' is often challenging in empirical market 1 The idea often builds upon the early discussions by Hayek (1945) and was subsequently development further by Grossman (1976). It is also the central theme of the ''efficient market hypothesis'' (Fama 1970). 2 Alternatively, some traders could seek to learn more about the true event at a cost. However, Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) challenged the notion that traders will be willing to incur such costs if market prices will eventual reveal what they learnt. 3 For example, consider the state space f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g, where the true state is 4. Suppose that trader A knows that the true state is in f1; 2; 3; 4g and trader B knows that the true state is in f4; 5; 6g. Combining both pieces of information through open communication, both traders will realise that the true state must be 4. Conversely, if trader B's partition is such that she knows the true state to be in f3; 4; 5g, then the combined information can only reveal that the true state is either 3 or 4. research. Controlled experimental environments complete the picture by studying market behaviour in a highly structured environment, where the experiment designer controls the information structure. Laboratory experiments study the general principles underpinning economic behavior with extraordinary control over independent variables, and generally generalise well to various field environments (Camerer 2015). Market experiments, in particular, yield similar results with student and businessmen populations (e.g., Porter and Smith 1994).",

In their experiments, the true state of the world can either be X, Y or Z with some known probabilities. For each state other than the true state, half of the traders are informed of the false state. For example, let the true state be Y. In this case, half of the traders know the true state to be either X or Y (i.e., not Z), and the other traders know the true state to be either Y or Z (i.e., not X). Thus, traders have heterogeneous information that, if aggregated efficiently, is enough to fully reveal the true state. In the treatments closest to our design, the market consists of three types of assets x, y and z, which pay a positive dividend for the states X, Y, and Z, respectively (e.g., asset x pays a positive dividend if and only if the true state is X). 6 The results of Plott and Sunder (1988) show that market prices converge to the true value of the asset-thereby revealing the true stateeven when there is no immediate incentive for any trader to reveal their private information. However, the information structure used in the experiments greatly facilitates information dissemination and aggregation. For example, if the true event is Y, then the distribution of private information implies that demand for asset y will easily outstrip those for assets x and z. 7 As such, the market demand for asset y relative to those of assets x and z will immediately reveal the true event to be Y.",

First, as different states of the world map to the same asset value, we generate a situation where, in some states, all of the traders hold exactly the same beliefs over the assets' values despite having diverse information regarding the underlying state of the world. In previous studies, such as Plott and Sunder (1988), traders always potentially observe some market activity (asks, bids, or transactions) that is inconsistent with some state of the world that they consider possible. Such market activity reveals that there exist other traders who hold different information, and thus conveys new information about the true state. In our setting, in contrast, the different information held by different traders translates to the same beliefs and the same market activity, hence the observed market activity does not provide any new information regarding the true state. The diverse information held by different traders, if aggregated successfully, is nonetheless sufficient to fully reveal the true state. To do so requires counterfactual reasoning: traders should realize that all observed market activity is consistent with their own beliefs about the assets' values, and consequently eliminate the states of the world in which some of the other traders hold differing beliefs. Our experiment tests whether this feature of the market impedes, or even prevents, successful aggregation of information.",

Accordingly, we test whether these minority traders become better informed about the true state of the world and about the true value of the assets, and whether they can leverage this knowledge for profit. 8 Finally, previous studies have focused on aggregate outcomes in the market. Our experimental design introduces yet another new feature.

Against this backdrop, three questions are investigated: RQ1: Can Arrow-Debreu markets be successful at aggregating private information about the true event into prices, even when traders are endowed with homogeneous beliefs, such that information aggregation is challenging and requires traders to employ sophisticated counterfactual reasoning? RQ2: Are minority traders better informed about the true event, can they leverage this knowledge for profit, and are they instrumental in driving prices to reveal the true state? RQ3: Can individuals in the market learn the true event from the movement of prices, and is individual learning a necessary condition for information aggregation in the prices?",

Thus, we test the ability of the market to aggregate dispersed information by comparing the observed final market prices to the FRE and PIE predictions. The post-market beliefs allow us to test the role of individual beliefs in market prices convergence to the true values and the dissemination of information throughout the market. By repeating the market game, we are able to test the role of market experience in information aggregation and dissemination. 10 Our findings can be summarised as follows. Markets are successful at aggregating dispersed information in the prices when traders are experienced, but not in early rounds. Although market prices reflect the true state, traders largely remain ignorant in the post-market stage. This finding is consistent with the marginal trader hypothesis (e.g., Forsythe et al. 1992), which posits that efficiency in market prices only require a small population of sophisticated traders, who are influential in driving prices to the competitive equilibrium. We observe successful price convergence even in the more challenging case of homogeneous beliefs. That is, we do not find any significant differences in the information aggregation properties of markets when traders are endowed with homogeneous or heterogeneous private information. Finally, we find some evidence suggesting that minority traders learn about the true event before others and are instrumental in driving prices towards the FRE. There is no evidence, however, that the better-informed minority traders are able to extract a higher share of the surplus.",

Because the complexity of the CDA mechanism makes it extremely difficult to analyse with standard game theoretical methods, we evaluate the market's success at aggregating information by comparing market prices against the fully revealing rational expectations equilibrium (FRE) and the prior-information equilibrium (PIE) described in full below. Table 1 details the FRE and PIE predicted prices of each asset a in the market and the corresponding implied proportion of submitted beliefs in the post-market stage. 14 The PIE describes the market clearing prices when risk-neutral traders use Bayes' rule to update their posteriors about the true event given their own private information and condition their demands upon such posteriors. However, there is no belief updating following trade, and consequently the true event is only partially revealed in prices. For example if s \u00c3 \u00bc XXO, then traders in groups 1 and 2 will assign equal posteriors to the events 1 and 2, whilst those in group 3 will assign equal posteriors to the events 2 and 3.

In contrast, the non-minority traders (those in groups 1 and 2), who already knew that there is at least one type O group receive no new information from the prices, and therefore remain uninformed.

In heterogeneous information events, agents make inferences from actual observed trade. In the homogeneous information events, in contrast, agents deduce the true event from not observing trade on an asset, which would have been traded in some counterfactual event. Recognising that empirical (experimental and otherwise) data are often noisy, and some trade is likely to happen, it is not clear whether low volumes or prices are enough for agents to be confident at ascertaining the true event. Even complete market inactivity is somewhat ambiguous, as it is not clear how much time should be allowed to elapse before concluding that there is no demand for the asset. Lack of trade may be explained, for example, by agents concentrating on other parts of the market.

We explore this possibility by using the post-market stage to identify the 'sophisticated' traders independent of their market behaviour. We define expert traders to be those who submitted a correct belief in at least nine out of the ten markets they participated in. This categorization yields 24% (20 of 84) expert traders. 38  Table 3 presents mixed-effects regressions comparing the expert traders with the other traders. Columns (1) and (2) reveal that expert traders made larger profits, and held higher share of the true asset at the end of trade. Looking at the expert traders' purchase decisions, we see in Columns (3) and (4) that experts were more judicious in their purchase decisions, making fewer purchases, and being more likely to purchase the true asset compared to non-experts. The MAD in column (6) of the table, defined as the mean absolute deviation of the trader's purchases from the FRE, shows that the experts' mean purchase price is indeed significantly closer to the FRE price. To further test whether expert traders were more likely to push prices closer to the FRE, we look at how prices move with each purchase made by the trader. 39 We define convergent purchases to be purchases made at a price that is at least as close to the FRE price as in the preceding transaction of the same asset. 40 Column (5) in Table 3 details the share of 37 For example if x\u00f0s \u00c3 \u00de \u00bc 1, then the FRE predicts that all 4 minority subjects and all 8 non-minority subjects will submit beliefs b \u00bc 1. In contrast, the PIE predicts that beliefs b \u00bc 0 and b \u00bc 1 will be each submitted by 2 minority subjects. In addition, beliefs b \u00bc 1 and b \u00bc 2 will each be submitted by 4 minority subjects. 38 Only four traders submitted correct beliefs in all ten rounds. The results are robust to setting the criterion at 7, 8, or 10 correct beliefs. 39 Selling decisions are more difficult to analyse since even traders who are informed about the true event should seek to sell assets at prices away from the FRE. 40 Suppose that the sequence of purchase prices for an asset is 75, 79, 122, 60, 89 and 89 with the FRE price being 100. Then only the second, fifth and sixth purchases will be defined as convergent as they are convergent purchases out of the trader's total purchases in the round. Close to 61% of non-experts' purchases do not move the price away from the FRE compared to 65% for expert traders. This difference increases to nine percent points and becomes significant at the 10% level if we restrict the analysis to experienced traders only.",

With experience, however, we see a substantial improvement even in the homogeneous events. Experienced subjects are roughly equally likely to be correct in both event types, submitting correct beliefs in 0.73 and 0.65 of instances for the heterogeneous and homogeneous events, respectively (Fisher exact, q \u00bc 0:152). 41 It thus appears that homogeneous events pose greater difficulty for traders to discover the true state of the world. Notwithstanding, this does not impede price convergence. This conclusion should be taken cautiously, however, as the postmarket beliefs may be influenced by the ex-ante low probability of the homogeneous events. 42 Result 3 summarises: Footnote 40 continued no further away from 100 than the preceding purchase. If the FRE price is instead 0, then only fourth and sixth can be defined as convergent purchases. 41 Alternatively, we can also consider the mean absolute deviations of submitted beliefs from the FRE predictions. For inexperienced subjects, submitted beliefs are closer to the FRE predictions in heterogeneous relative to homogeneous information events (Mann-Whitney, q\\0:001, n \u00bc 35). In contrast, we find no significant differences for experienced subjects (Mann-Whitney, q \u00bc 0:328, n \u00bc 35). 42 This explanation implies a failure to properly apply Bayes' rule. To see why, first consider the case where s \u00c3 \u00bc OOO (homogeneous event). By Bayes' rule, each uninformed subject should assign equal probability to the events 0 and 1. However, the prior probability of nature choosing event 1 is also three times more than 0. Thus, the failure to properly apply Bayes' rule will lead to uninformed subjects incorrectly assigning greater weights to the event 1.

In this section we test these predictions using the market behaviour and submitted beliefs of minority traders. Table 4 provides some evidence supporting the model's predictions. Comparing behaviour in the heterogeneous events within subjects, we find that when (exogenously) placed in the minority role, traders are better informed, as measured by post-market beliefs (p\\0:05 for the marginal effect in the regression reported in Column (1)). Column (4) shows that minority traders are more active, making 9% more purchases than non-minorities. They are, however, not more likely to purchase the true asset or to make a convergent purchase, as seen in Columns (5) and (6). Notwithstanding, Column (7) reveals that minority traders buy at closer to the FRE price, suggesting that when minority traders do make a convergent purchase, their purchase price moves a larger distance from the preceding traded price towards the FRE price. Finally, Columns (2) and (3) show that, at the end of trade, minority traders hold a larger share of the true asset in their inventory, but do not make a larger profit overall compared to rounds in which they are cast in the non-minority role. Result 4 summarises these observations.",

A central claim of the efficient market hypothesis (e.g., Fama 1970) is that if markets are strong-form efficient, then any trader seeking to exploit his private information immediately reveals the same information from his demand of assets, thus negating any possible gains.

However, for traders in group 3, the failure to properly apply Bayes' rule will lead them to put greater weights on event 2, given that the prior probability on event 3 is 1/8. Thus, the proportion of correct subjects will be more than 1/2. The above suggests that whilst minority traders may initially be able to profit their knowledge of the true event, such gains will eventually be eroded over time. To study the development of minority gains over time , we compute the liquidation value (i.e., how much the portfolio of cash and assets is worth after the loan of 5000 ECU is returned) of the trader's portfolio at window t. We then regress for each window t, the liquidation value on the minority subjects, using fixed subject effects with session level clustering. The minority dummy coefficient, b 1;t , thus captures the expected difference in liquidation value between the minority and non-minority roles at window t. Figure 6 plots the estimate for b 1;t at each window t. The hump shape distribution of b 1 suggests that the liquidation value of a minority trader increases during the early periods of the round (i.e., between windows 2-5), with the gap disappearing as trade proceeds. However, the differences are not significant at the 5% level.",

We consider an experimental design which allows us to endow traders with homogeneous and heterogeneous private information about the true event. With this framework, we advance a simple model which shows that markets converge to the fully revealing rational expectations equilibrium for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases, indicating that the true event will be reflected in prices. However, the process of convergence to the FRE is challenging and requires traders to perform counterfactual reasoning. A post-market stage allows us to estimate Information aggregation in Arrow-Debreu markets: an... individual learning independent of market activity, and to correlate learning and market behaviour. We find that markets can be successful at aggregating information, but only when market participants have experience with the trading mechanisms. When traders are experienced, the market prices successfully aggregate and reflect the true state, even when traders start out with induced homogeneous beliefs. The requirement for counterfactual reasoning does not appear to impede market convergence. Although the prices reveal the true state, individual learning is strongly constrained. Consistent with the marginal trader hypothesis, we find that a limited number of sophisticated traders is sufficient to drive market prices towards the rational expectations equilibrium. The role traders play in price convergence depends both on endogenous characteristics and on information asymmetries. The last point suggests that even when some traders gain insider knowledge, markets can efficiently price this knowledge.",

In the first five rounds, these appeared to be distributed rather uniformly across all subjects. In the last five rounds, bankruptcies were concentrated in a handful of subjects, suggesting that the initial bankruptcies were part of the learning process. See the ''supplementary Appendix'' for more details. Note that the limited liability doesn't impact the theoretical analysis, as it doesn't bias trading decisions with respect to the true asset, but may impede information aggregation by increasing risky and/or noisy investments.
