            "text": "The present study aimed to investigate the effects of 17\u03b2-estradiol and tamoxifen, an agonist and inhibitor of the estrogen receptor (ER), respectively, on the proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells, as well as the messenger (m)RNA expression levels of ER-\u03b136. Nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed that ER-\u03b136 was expressed in the BGC823, MKN45 and SGC7901 human gastric cancer cell lines. Subsequently, the BGC823 cell line was stimulated with various concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol or tamoxifen for 24 or 48 h, and the proliferation, apoptosis and mRNA expression levels of ER-\u03b136 were determined by water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 assay, flow cytometry and RT-quantitative PCR, respectively. The activity of BGC823 cells was significantly increased following treatment with 10-12 mol/l 17\u03b2-estradiol for 24 h (P=0.013), as compared with the control, and reached a peak at 48 h (P=0.002). Notably, the activity of BGC823 cells was decreased with increasing concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol, although it remained higher compared with that of the control. In the tamoxifen-treated groups, the cell activity decreased as the drug concentration increased. The apoptosis rate was markedly reduced in the 17\u03b2-estradiol group after 24 h (10-12 mol/l, P=0.013; 10-11 mol/l, P=0.023; and 10-10 mol/l, P=0.017) and after 48 h (10-12 mol/l, P=0.002; 10-11 mol/l, P=0.011; and 10-10 mol/l, P=0.033), whereas the rate of apoptosis increased as the tamoxifen concentration increased (24 h: 5x10-6 mol/l, P=0.002; and 10-5 mol/l, P=0.001; and 48 h: 5x10-6 mol/l, P=0.014 and 10-5 mol/l, P=0.0021), as compared with the control group. The mRNA expression levels of ER-\u03b136 were significantly increased after 24 h of treatment with 10-12 mol/l (P=0.024), 10-11 mol/l (P=0.0113) and 10-10 mol/l (P=0.0037) 17\u03b2-estradiol compared with the control group when the concentration of 17\u03b2-estradiol was low, and the same was observed after 48 h of treatment 10-12 mol/l (P=0.0164), 10-11 mol/l (P=0.0342) and 10-10 mol/l (P=0.0198) 17\u03b2-estradiol. The mRNA expression levels of ER-\u03b136 were significantly decreased with increasing concentrations of tamoxifen after 24 h (5x10-6 mol/l, P=0.0233; and 10-5 mol/l, P=0.007) and after 48 h (5x10-6 mol/l, P=0.001; and 10-5 mol/l, P=0.0153). In addition, the ability of tamoxifen to inhibit the growth of gastric cancer cells was concentration-dependent. The results of the present study suggested that gastric cancer cells were sensitive to the effects of 17\u03b2-estradiol and tamoxifen, and that tamoxifen is able to induce gastric cancer cell apoptosis. The expression levels of ER-\u03b136 were upregulated, and the growth of gastric cancer cells was increased, following treatment with 17\u03b2-estradiol, thus suggesting that gastric cancer tumors are stimulated by estrogen."

The differences between the genders become negligible when female patients reach the menopause, and the morbidity associated with gastric cancer was reported to decrease in men who had been treated with estrogen for prostate carcinoma (1)(2)(3). These findings suggested that estrogen has a positive association with gastric cancer, although the underlying reasons are unclear. Estrogen acts by binding to its ligand (4,5). Previous studies reported that estrogen receptors (ERs) were expressed in the tumors of estrogen-independent organs, including the stomach, which indicates that, in these organs, the occurrence and development of a tumor is associated with estrogen (6)(7)(8)(9)(10).",

Previous studies have demonstrated that ER-\u03b136 is located at the cytomembrane, where is involved in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, by mediating rapid signal transduction (5). There are few reports regarding the function, mechanism and clinical significance of ER-\u03b136 in gastric cancer, although previous studies suggested that ER-\u03b136 has a central role in balancing the proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells (11)(12)(13)(14). 17\u03b2-estradiol, which is a type of agonist of the ER, has a critical role in physiological processes by binding to its ligand to mediate the expression of various genes (15)(16)(17). Conversely, tamoxifen, which is a non-steroidal triphenylethylene, affects the proliferation and apoptosis of cells by selectively competing with estrogen for the ER binding site, thus altering the expression levels of various cytokines (18)(19)(20). The present study aimed to investigate the effects of 17\u03b2-estradiol and tamoxifen on the proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer cell lines cultured in vitro. In addition, the role of ER-\u03b136 in the proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).",

            "text": "ER-\u03b136 is a novel subtype of ER that was discovered and cloned by Professor Zhaoyi Wang, and whose molecular weight is 35.7 kDa. As compared with the traditional ER, ER-\u03b136 does not participate in the activation of the ERE due to loss of the AF1 and AF2 domains (4,5). However, ER-\u03b136 possesses three myristoylation sites, including amino acids 25-30 [glycine (Gly)-valine-tryptophan-serine-cysteine-glutamate (Glu)], 76-81 [Gly-methionine (Met)-Met-lysine-Gly-Gly] and 171-176 [Glu-leucine (Leu)-Leu-threonine-asparagine-Leu], which are associated with the receptor's location at the membrane (5). Wang et al (4) reported that the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 was increased following stimulation of HEK-293 cells overexpressing ER-\u03b136 with 17\u03b2-estradiol for 5 min. The level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation peaked at 30 min, and then commenced to decline, which may suggest that ER-\u03b136 promotes the proliferation of cells by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK signaling pathway (15).",

Low-dose 17\u03b2-estradiol displayed an enhanced ability to promote the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, as compared with high concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol. These results were consistent with the findings of previous epidemiological studies, in which lower levels of estrogen in males were associated with higher morbidity of gastric cancer in males compared with females (1). In addition, in the present study, the proliferation of gastric cancer cells was inhibited by tamoxifen in a concentration-and time-dependent manner. These results suggested that gastric cancer cells were sensitive to estrogen, and that gastric cancer tumors are estrogen-responsive. Furthermore, the rate of apoptosis was increased in gastric cancer cells treated with tamoxifen, thus indicating that tamoxifen induces gastric cancer cell apoptosis in vitro."

The apoptosis of gastric cancer cells was more obvious, and their mRNA expression levels of ER-\u03b136 were decreased to a greater extent, which indicated that ER-\u03b136 is important in the balance between proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells."

In eukaryotic cells, at least four types of MAPK signal transducers have been reported, including ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), P38 and ERK5 (24). It has been hypothesized that JNK mediates the apoptosis of cells in the emergency response, thus inhibiting apoptosis and promoting proliferation when the ERK cascade is dominant, while initiating apoptosis when the JNK cascade is dominant (25)(26)(27)(28)(29)(30)(31)(32)(33).",
