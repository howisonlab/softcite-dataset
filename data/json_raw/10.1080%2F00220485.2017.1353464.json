Our program is consistently one of the largest on campus with between 45 and 65 majors graduating each year. Although we only have one major and one minor (both in economics), we offer two types of courses: Group E courses, which are typical of those offered by an economics department; and Group B courses, which include accounting, entrepreneurship, and applied finance. Many of our students also major in mathematics, applied mathematics and statistics, or computer science. Double majors with international studies, geography, and political science are also common. Macalester is somewhat unique with its large geography department, and we encourage our students to take courses in geographical information systems in order to expand their empirical tool kit.",

Particularly noteworthy here is our long history of placing graduates in investment banking. Students interested in this path take our accounting and finance courses, as well as Introduction to Investment Banking, which includes a class trip to New York where they interact with alumni working on Wall Street. Consulting has become a popular career path in recent years, and many alumni have gone on to work for Accenture, Analysis Group, Brattle Group, Cornerstone, Deloitte, McKinsey, and other firms. A large number of students are interested in economic development and the nonprofit world, with many finding positions at organizations like the Urban Institute, World Bank, the Federal Reserve System, Peace Corps, and so on. Approximately two to four of our students enter PhD programs each year. For instance, this past fall, two began PhD programs in economics, one in computer science and another in health care management. Hoyt and McGoldrick (2017) summarize the goals of student research that economics departments typically pursue: \"[T]hey want students to identify and ask worthwhile questions, connect these to the literature, hypothesize, gather and process data accordingly, effectively employ analytical tools, interpret findings, and present their work in writing and orally\" (p. 656). At Macalester, we attempt to achieve these goals by asking students to engage in research at three different points in the economics major.",

Enrollments are capped at 22 students per section due to the heavy burden that draft editing imposes on the professor. The course covers standard econometric topics: estimation using OLS, hypothesis testing, serial correlation and time series, as well as introduction to more advanced topics such as panel data, instrumental variables, and logit/probit estimation. Data analysis is conducted with STATA, which students begin using the second week of class, and the instruction tends to be applied rather than mathematical/algebraic. A required one-hour lab was added 25 years ago to provide extra instruction time to cover research methods. The course also receives extensive support from our library staff who have developed instruction modules and resource guides to assist students with their research. 1 The econometrics course builds on knowledge students acquire in Introduction to Statistics, the 200-level elective, and the intermediate micro and macro theory courses. Because the introductory statistics course covers a significant amount of regression analysis, students hit the ground running in econometrics and are prepared to immerse themselves in the mechanical process of technical writing in economics. Throughout the semester, they simultaneously work on problem sets and their research paper. With guidance from the instructor, students choose their own research topic and locate relevant datasets. There is no final exam; rather the research paper serves as the final for the course. This approach has proved successful, and a large number of papers from this course have won prizes from the Minnesota Economic Association and other professional organizations.",

If the proposal is accepted, they enroll in the senior honors seminar in the fall of their senior year where they learn more about the research process and critique each other's work. It is not uncommon for the honors thesis to be an extension of a project that began in the econometrics course. Students continue working on their thesis during the spring semester and provide an oral defense in mid-April. Typically, some of these students will also present their work at conferences such as those held by the Midwest Economics Association. Seniors who do not write an honors thesis enroll in a 400-level capstone course and complete a large research project related to the focus of the course. We currently offer six capstone courses: Advanced Econometrics, Applied Dynamic Macroeconomics, Behavioral and Experimental Economics, Economics of Public Policy, Empirical Finance, and International Economic Development.
