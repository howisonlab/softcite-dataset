            "text": "Background and aims. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are antidepressants increasingly prescribed for pregnancy and postpartum depression. However, these compounds can cross the placenta and also pass into breast milk, thus reaching the fetus and infant during critical developmental stages, potentially causing adverse effects. Fluoxetine, a widely used SSRI, has been shown to affect (neuro) endocrine signaling in various organisms, including humans. This compound can also interact with estrogen receptors in vitro and cause an estrogen-dependent uterotrophic response in rodents. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to assess if the active metabolite of fluoxetine, namely norfluoxetine (NFLX), shares the same capacity for estrogen receptor interaction. Methods. The in vitro (anti)estrogenic activity of norfluoxetine was assessed using a firefly luciferase reporter construct in the T47D-Kbluc breast cancer cell line. These cells express nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs) that can activate the transcription of the luciferase reporter gene upon binding of ER agonists. Light emission was monitored in case of cells exposed to norfluoxetine or mixtures of norfluoxetineestradiol. Cell viability was assessed using a resazurin-based assay. Results. During individual testing, NFLX was able to induce a significant increase in luciferase activity compared to control, but only at the highest concentration tested (10 \u00b5M). In binary mixtures with estradiol (30 pM constant concentration) a significant increase in luminescence was observed at low submicromolar norfluoxetine concentrations compared to estradiol alone. Conclusion. Norfluoxetine can induce estrogenic effects in vitro and can potentiate the activity of estradiol. However, further studies are needed to clarify if these observed estrogenic effects may have detrimental consequences for human exposure.",

Studies on fish showed that FLX can disrupt the physiological responses of the reproductive axis by interfering with the neuroendocrine regulation of steroidogenesis and gametogenesis. Furthermore, FLX can also disrupt estrogen signaling in the brain by reducing the expression of estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus [10]. In addition, a few studies on rodents suggested that FLX could interfere with sexual steroid signaling during development, as this compound was able to affect sexual brain differentiation, sexual behaviour, testicular development and sperm production in rat offspring exposed in utero and/or through lactation [12][13][14][15][16]. Finally, a study by Mueller et al. showed that FLX can activate estrogen receptors in vitro and can also induce an estrogendependent uterotrophic response in rodents [17].",

As the parent compound, NFLX is highly lipophilic and crosses the blood-brain barrier to accumulate in the brain, where it acts as an antidepressant by selectively blocking the serotonin transporter [18]. However, the structural and functional similarities of the two compounds suggest that NFLX might also be an active ligand for nuclear ERs.",

However,  the small magnitude of the observed effect (10% of E 2 induction) suggests that NFLX is a weak ER agonist at high concentrations.",

In this case, NFLX caused an increase in the E 2induced transcriptional activity at low (submicromolar) concentrations. Considering the fact that no effect was observed at these concentrations during individual testing, we hypothesize that NFLX can act in a synergistic manner with E 2 . Conversely, at 10 \u03bcM we observed a significant decrease in signal as compared to E 2 . This is in line with the previous finding from individual testing and suggests that NFLX can displace the natural ligand from the ERs, thus resulting in a decrease in signal due to the weak agonist properties of NFLX.",

            "text": "These results may raise concern regarding the endocrine disruptive potential of NFLX, since the synergistic effect observed at submicromolar concentrations suggests that this compound may interfere with estrogenic signaling at therapeutic plasma concentrations, which are reported to be below 1 \u03bcM, with variations depending on FLX dose and CYP2D6/CYP2C9 genotype [19,20]. In the fetus and newborns, NFLX concentrations reach aproximately 70 to 80% of the maternal plasma levels [21]. Also, during breastfeeding, the infants receive less than 1% of the maternal FLX dose through breast milk [21]. However, FLX, as well as NFLX are highly bound to plasma proteins (~95%) and therefore less compound may be available for receptor interaction in vivo compared to our in vitro studies [22,23]. Little is known about the level of FLX or NFLX protein binding and metabolism in the fetus and newborn [24]. Although higher concentrations can be achieved in brain tissue due to accumulation of FLX and NFLX, the biological significance of the observed effect of NFLX at 10 \u03bcM remains unclear due to the fact that only total FLX-NFLX concentrations have been reported for the human brain (~ 13 \u03bcM) [25]. Further in vitro and in vivo testing would be useful to understand the relevance of our present findings in the context of disrupted estrogenic signaling during development.",
