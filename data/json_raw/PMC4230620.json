However, the extent to which different mammalian transgene methods faithfully report on the properties of endogenous proteins has not been studied comparatively. Here we use quantitative live-cell imaging and single-molecule spectroscopy to analyze how different transgene systems affect imaging of the functional properties of the mitotic kinase Aurora B. We show that the transgene method fundamentally influences level and variability of expression and can severely compromise the ability to report on endogenous binding and localization parameters, providing a guide for quantitative imaging studies in mammalian cells.

            "text": "Gene tagging with green fluorescent protein (GFP) has revolutionized our understanding of the dynamic properties of the cellular proteome. Powerful fluorescence imaging technologies have made quantitative measurements of protein biophysics and biochemistry feasible in situ (Wu and Pollard, 2005;Maeder et al., 2007). Highthroughput imaging and computational data integration make such studies scalable to whole pathways and proteomes (Wu and Pollard, 2005;Maeder et al., 2007). Whereas fusing fluorescent tags to endogenous proteins is routine in yeast, in human cells, the insight gained from quantitative imaging approaches has been limited by the available transgene methodologies. The majority of past studies relied on systems that do not faithfully maintain physiological gene expression, such as cDNA plasmids with heterologous promoters that are randomly integrated into the human cell's genome for stable expression. The resulting overexpression or underexpression is known to affect protein function through numerous mechanisms, such as nonspecific aggregation, alterations in folding, and imbalance with endogenous binding partners (Burgess et al., 2012;Gibson et al., 2013). These considerations have motivated the development of second-generation plasmid-based systems such as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), which retain endogenous cis-acting regulatory sequences and can also be randomly integrated into the genome of the host cell (Poser et al., 2008). However, position-effect variegation in BACs has not been investigated, and all superexpression systems suffer from the continued presence of untagged protein produced from endogenous loci, which cannot be imaged but may carry out all or part of the function of the fusion protein under study (Yue et al., 2008). Although RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of endogenous protein can be used in combination with RNAi-resistant transgenes, incomplete knockdown and off-target effects make such experiments difficult to control and interpret (Ma et al., 2006). Recently multiple genome-editing technologies, including zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and Tale-activated endonucleases (TALENs), have been developed to modify endogenous mammalian loci (Bibikova et al., 2003;Miller et al., 2011). However, whether such knock-in transgenes truly are quantitatively superior to superexpression approaches has not been systematically studied to date. homology to endogenous loci ( Figure 1Ai). In addition, we performed random integration of BACs or cDNA plasmids ( Figure 1Aii; Poser et al., 2008). For each transgene method ( Figure 1A), we created several monoclonal or pooled HeLa lines stably expressing mitotic kinase Aurora kinase B (AURKB-GFP) using four different transgene methods ( Figure 1A). We used genome editing by ZFNs (Bibikova et al., 2003) or TALENs (Miller et al., 2011) to target recombination of EGFP from a donor plasmid containing regions of FIGURE 1: Construction and validation of genome-edited cell lines expressing AURKB-GFP.

As expected for a constitutive heterologous promoter (cytomegalovirus; Boshart et al., 1985), different cDNA clones showed the strongest overexpression and the most variable expression between cell lines (\u223c0.4-to 5.7-fold). Flow cytometry of the intensity distribution of AURKB-GFP from 20,000 cells for each tagging method showed greatest cell-to-cell homogeneity for the two genome-editing methods (CV = 23 [ZFN], 23 [TALEN]), followed by BACs and cDNAs, which exhibited more variability ( Figure 2B; CV = 30 and 112, respectively). Similarly, whereas in genome-edited and BAC systems, nearly all cells expressed the fusion protein (ZFN, 99%; BAC, 92-99%), cDNA clones had a variable number of expressing cells ( Figure 2B; 28-89%).",

            "text": "Having assessed total expression level and cell-to-cell variation, we next addressed subcellular abundance of the fusion proteins in mitotic metaphase, when AURKB resides mostly on mitotic chromosomes (Carmena et al., 2012). Genome-edited cells exhibited the expected specific localization to metaphase chromosomes, with barely detectable levels of unbound cytoplasmic protein. By contrast, overexpression from the plasmid-based systems led to elevated cytoplasmic signal ( Figure 2C and Supplemental Figure S2B, arrowheads). We quantified the absolute cytoplasmic concentration of AURKB-GFP using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) in living cells. FCS records fluorescence intensity fluctuations in a small confocal volume as a function of time, allowing determination of physical properties, including the concentration of the fluorescent species from the amplitude of the FCS autocorrelation function ( Figure 2D; see Materials and Methods). As such, it is well suited to the detection of mobile cytosolic proteins expressed at nanomolar to micromolar levels. AURKB-GFP genome-edited cells showed a clear autocorrelation signal distinguishable from that of wild-type cells (Supplemental Figure S2C), indicating the presence of a cytoplasmic pool. Consistent with our Western blotting, flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy data, FCS analysis showed that AURKB-GFP genome-edited cells had a low cytoplasmic concentration of 8.6 nM \u00b1 5.3 SD (ZFN) or 6.9 nM \u00b1 3.5 (TALEN), whereas overexpression from the plasmid-based systems resulted in significantly higher cytoplasmic concentrations of 23.8 nM \u00b1 17.1 (BAC) or 86.7 nM \u00b1 156.7 (cDNA; Figure 2, E and F, and Supplemental Figure S2D). AURKB plays several critical roles in genome segregation via the phosphorylation of substrates on chromatin such as core histones and kinetochore proteins and by forming phosphorylation gradients (Tanaka et al., 2002;Wang et al., 2011;Carmena et al., 2012). The balance between soluble cytoplasmic and chromosome-bound kinase is therefore key to interpreting its function. To determine whether the transgene method would perturb this balance, we quantified the amount of AURKB-GFP localized to chromosomes on the metaphase plate using FCS-calibrated confocal imaging in live, dividing cells. Here first we recorded an FCS trace in the cytoplasm to determine the absolute local concentration of GFP and calibrate the corresponding confocal pixel intensity, which thus allows us to transform the entire confocal image into a concentration map ( Figure 3A). Despite the different total cell expression levels, BACs showed a similar chromatin-bound AURKB-GFP concentration to genome-edited cells, whereas cDNAs were very variable ( Figure 3, B and C). By combining our concentration measurements with threedimensional reconstructed volumes of mitotic chromosomes and cytoplasm, we obtained the total number of chromatin-bound and free AURKB-GFP proteins. We found that the fraction of AURKB-GFP bound to chromatin is significantly higher in genome-edited cells than in plasmid-based systems ( Figure 3D). Whereas in genome-edited cells, \u223c75% of total cellular AURKB-GFP resides on chromatin, only 40-50% does so in plasmid-based systems, with the AURKB-GFP, which we validated with a series of assays ( Figure 1B; see Materials and Methods for detailed protocols). Briefly, after introduction of the tag, expressing cells were isolated by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS; Figure 1C) and then screened by fluorescence microscopy for specific localization to mitotic organelles as expected for AURKB ( Figure 1D; Terada et al., 1998). We distinguished homozygous from heterozygous clones (AURKB has three alleles in HeLa cells; Landry et al., 2013) for the genome-editing methods ( Figure 1B; In vitro) by genomic PCR ( Figure 1E and Supplemental Figure S1A), Western blot ( Figure 1F and Supplemental Figure S1B), and Southern blot ( Figure 1G and Supplemental Figure  S1, C and D).",

            "text": "Having validated this set of AURKB-GFP cells generated from the same parental HeLa line, we systematically analyzed the behavior of the expressed fusion proteins. First, we examined total expression level of AURKB-GFP by Western blotting of whole-cell extracts with anti-AURKB or anti-GFP antibodies (Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure S2A). All genome-edited clones exhibited AURKB-GFP levels similar to the endogenous protein with relatively little variation and independent of the genome-targeting method used to generate them or their zygosity (\u223c0.6-to 1.7-fold wild type). By contrast, expression of AURKB-GFP from randomly integrated BACs resulted in clearly visible overexpression in the tested clones (\u223c2.1-to 3.6-fold wild type), suggesting that the presence of the native promoter is not sufficient to ensure physiological expression  that chromatin-binding sites become saturated in overexpression systems, forcing aberrant accumulation of the fusion protein in the cytosol. A key prerequisite for systems microscopy is to detect complexes incorporating the tagged protein inside the cell. It is known that fraction decreasing as the total amount of AURKB increases. This relationship is in agreement with a mathematical model (solid line in Figure 3E; see Materials and Methods) that has a limited number of high-affinity binding sites on chromatin (\u223c130,000-150,000 molecules), with a binding K d of 3.4-5.8 nM. Thus, our results suggest FIGURE 2: Expression system determines AURKB-GFP levels. (A) Western blot comparison of AURKB levels in nocodazole-arrested cells. BAC-expressed AURKB-GFP runs at a higher molecular weight due to the presence of an S-peptide in addition to the EGFP tag. The graph shows the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. (B) Flow cytometry analysis of AURKB-GFP intensity in nocodazole-arrested cells. Coefficient of variation is from the whole population. GFP+ was defined as 3 SD above autofluorescence from wild-type cells. (C) Sum intensity confocal images of AURKB-GFP using the same imaging conditions throughout. One metaphase cell is shown per panel. Left to right: ZHZ2, ZHZ1, ZHET1, THET1, THET2, BP1, BC1, BP2, BC2, cDP1, cDC1, cDC2, and cDC3. Scale bar, 7 \u03bcm. (D) The amplitude of the FCS autocorrelation function (see Materials and Methods), G(0), is inversely proportional to particle number. Absolute protein concentration, c, is calculated using the measured confocal volume, V. (E) AURKB-GFP FCS autocorrelation curves from single representative cells. Top to bottom: ZHZ2, THET1, ZHET1, cDC3, BP2, BC2, cDC2, and cDC1. (F) AURKB-GFP cytoplasmic concentration calculated by fitting FCS autocorrelation curves with a onecomponent anomalous model of diffusion as described in Materials and Methods. The box and whiskers plot is from >23 cells/sample from two experiments. The mean is depicted as a diamond and the median as a horizontal line, and the whiskers show the minimum and maximum. Thus, phenotypically normal cells may still be unsuitable for quantitative fluorescence microscopy. If quantitative imaging of in vivo proteomic parameters is the objective, genome editing appears to be the method of choice to fluorescently tag genes in human cells.",

To assess whether the cytoplasmic accumulation in overexpressing clones would interfere with our ability to detect AURKB-containing complexes of low mobility, we determined the diffusion coefficient of AURKB-GFP by FCS. During interphase, AURKB-GFP cytoplasmic diffusion coefficients were indistinguishable between different transgene methods (ZFN, 13.2 \u03bcm 2 /s \u00b1 6.4 SD; BAC, 14.0 \u03bcm 2 /s \u00b1 4.6; Figure 3F, unfilled bars).

Genome-edited cells had reduced AURKB-GFP mobility compared with interphase (ZFN, 6.5 \u03bcm 2 /s \u00b1 3.9 SD), indicative of being bound to complexes of a larger Stokes radius, whereas in BAC cells, no significant change was detected (BAC, 14.7 \u03bcm 2 /s \u00b1 3.9). Of interest, cDNA cells showed variable behavior, with a decrease in diffusional mobility detectable only in cells with low AURKB-GFP expression level (cD C3; \u223c10 nM cytoplasmic) but not in higher-expressing clones (cD C2). Using automated time-lapse FCS to track single living nuclei through cell division, we acquired images and spectroscopy data every 15 min in dividing cells. Again, the cell cycle-dependent reversible change in diffusion coefficient from G2 to mitosis to G1 indicative of complex formation could readily be detected in single genome-edited cells but was not detectable in BAC-derived cells ( Figure 3G).",

            "text": "Overall our findings show that the choice of transgene system strongly affects expression level and variability of fluorescently tagged genes in human cells. These expression changes have important consequences for the accurate quantitation of endogenous binding parameters using microscopy. Our data indicate a clear anticorrelation between overexpression-with free ligand dominating the overall pool-and the ability to detect both specifically localized protein and protein engaged in large complexes. In terms of achieving a close to physiological expression level, the genome editing methods clearly outperformed plasmid-based approaches that suffer from heterologous promoters (cDNA) and position-effect variegation (cDNA and BAC). Furthermore, genome-edited cell lines showed far greater homogeneity, with almost any clone obtained by thorough screening (Figure 1) closely matching endogenous levels. Consistent with previous work (Doyon et al., 2011), this has implications for understanding the biology of cellular systems tagged with fluorescent proteins in human cells. However, it is also an important practical consideration when making cell lines stably expressing fluorescent fusion proteins, since it is often impossible to screen for true endogenous levels of expression in all subcellular pools. In addition, for essential genes, homozygous genome-edited cells ensure biological functionality of the fusion protein and exclude the possibility that complex formation and specific binding are obscured by the presence of unlabeled endogenous protein.",

Light was focused with a water immersion 40\u00d7/ 1.2 NA objective lens and collected by two avalanche photodiodes in the spectrally distinct regions 505-540 nm (F g ) and 600-650 nm (F r ) after passing through a pinhole set to 1 Airy unit. The instrument was calibrated before each experiment using Alexa 488 and Alexa 568 to align the pinholes and perform coverglass corrections. Each measurement was taken for 30 s in total.",
