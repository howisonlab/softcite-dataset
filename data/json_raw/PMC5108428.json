DESIGN Open-label, two-treatment, two-period, fixed-sequence crossover study. SETTING Clinical research unit. SUBJECTS Thirty-four healthy subjects. INTERVENTION In period 1, subjects received a single oral dose of evacetrapib 130 mg on day 1, followed by 7 days of analysis for evacetrapib plasma concentrations. In period 2, subjects received a once/day oral dose of omeprazole 40 mg on days 8-20, with a single oral dose of evacetrapib 130 mg administered 2 hours after the omeprazole dose on day 14, followed by 7 days of pharmacokinetic sampling. Subjects were discharged on day 21 and returned for a follow-up visit at least 14 days after the last dose of evacetrapib in period 2. Gastric pH was measured before subjects received each evacetrapib dose. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from plasma concentration-time data and compared between periods 1 and 2. Geometric mean ratios with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. The mean age of the 34 subjects was 40.9 years; mean body mass index was 27.2 kg/m 2. Omeprazole treatment increased mean gastric pH across all subjects by 2.80 and increased evacetrapib area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-\u221e) and maximum observed drug concentration (C max) by 15% (90% CI \u00c02 to 35) and 30% (90% CI 3-63), respectively. For both parameters, the upper bound of the 90% CI of the ratio of geometric leastsquares means exceeded 1.25 but was less than 2, indicating a weak interaction. To assess the effect of gastric pH on subjects who responded best to omeprazole treatment, the analyses were repeated to include only the 22 subjects whose predose gastric pH was 3.0 or lower in period 1 and 4.0 or higher in period 2. In this subpopulation, mean gastric pH increased by 4.15 during omeprazole treatment, and evacetrapib AUC 0-\u221e and C max increased by 22% (90% CI 4-42) and 35% (90% CI 1-80), respectively. Despite the small mathematical differences between the analyses, the overall effect in both was a minimal increase in evacetrapib exposure. Of 35 adverse events reported during the study, 4 (11.4%) were considered to be treatment-related, and most were mild in severity. CONCLUSION The impact of increased gastric pH on evacetrapib pharmacokinetics would not be expected to be clinically relevant. The magnitude of change in pH did not affect the degree of the interaction. KEY WORDS evacetrapib, omeprazole, gastric pH, pharmacokinetics.",

            "text": "The intended patient population for evacetrapib potentially included those taking proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, for the treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers and gastric reflux. Omeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion and thereby increases the pH of the gastric environment, which may alter the absorption of drugs with pH-dependent solubility. 11 Omeprazole is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19, but there is no drug-drug interaction risk with evacetrapib because its clearance is mediated by CYP3A and CYP2C8, and not CYP2C19. 12 Oral dosing with omeprazole once/ day achieves maximum suppression of gastric acid secretion within~4 days of treatment. After dosing with omeprazole 40 mg once/day for 7 days, median 24-hour gastric pH was increased in healthy subjects from 1.68 to 4.93, with the largest increases in gastric pH occurring 2-10 hours after the omeprazole dose. 13 The current study examined the impact of increased gastric pH on systemic exposure to evacetrapib, whose solubility is pH dependent. The results of gastric pH evaluations and the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a single oral dose of evacetrapib 130 mg given alone and with omeprazole are presented. The treatment of healthy subjects with omeprazole likened the gastric environment to that of conditions similar to others with achlorhydria (Table S1). Although evacetrapib development has been discontinued, the methods and analyses described in this study may be relevant to researchers wanting to conduct gastric pH-drug interaction studies with other drug candidates.",

The AUC was calculated by using a combination of the linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods (linear-log trapezoidal rule). The linear trapezoidal method was applied up to T max , and then the logarithmic trapezoidal method was used after T max . The minimum requirement for the calculation of AUC was the inclusion of at least three consecutive plasma concentrations above the lower level of quantitation, with at least one of these concentrations following C max . The C max and T max were reported from visual inspection of the concentration versus time curve. The apparent terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), apparent clearance, and apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase were also estimated. The t 1/2 was calculated, when appropriate, based on the apparent terminal log-linear portion of the concentration-time curve. The start of the terminal elimination phase for each subject was determined by visual inspection and generally was the first point at which there was no systematic deviation from the log-linear decline in plasma concentrations. The t 1/2 was estimated only when at least three concentrations were available for its calculation in the terminal phase.

Mean gastric pH for all subjects had increased by 2.80 (range \u00c02.1 to 5.8) after 7 days of omeprazole treatment (Table 1). A subpopulation of 22 subjects had predose gastric pH of 3.0 or lower on day 1 and 4.0 or higher on day 14; mean gastric pH in this subpopulation had increased by 4.15 (range 1.9-5.8) after omeprazole treatment. Figure 1A shows the mean plasma concentration-time profiles of evacetrapib given alone (day 1) and with omeprazole 40 mg once/day (day 14). Predose concentrations of evacetrapib were quantifiable for 14 of the 33 subjects in period 2 and were likely due to carry over from period 1. These concentrations ranged from 0.06 to 1.22% of C max and were included in the analysis. Given the magnitude of these predose concentrations relative to postdose concentrations, their effect on AUC estimates was considered negligible.  AUC 0-\u221e and C max of evacetrapib by 15% (90% CI \u00c02 to 35) and 30% (90% CI 3-63), respectively ( Table 3). The between-subject CV for AUC 0-\u221e was 40.9% (90% CI 30.8-63.3) and for C max was 49.7% (90% CI 35.6-88.5). There was no statistically significant difference in T max between the treatments. The statistical analysis was repeated to include only the 22 subjects whose predose gastric pH was 3.0 or lower on day 1 and 4.0 or higher on day 14. The purpose of analyzing this subgroup was to assess the effect of increased gastric pH on subjects who responded best to omeprazole treatment, which represents a so-called worst case scenario for the effect of increased gastric pH on evacetrapib pharmacokinetics. Figure 1B shows the mean plasma concentration-time profiles for evacetrapib following evacetrapib 130 mg with and without omeprazole in this subgroup. Table 2 summarizes the geometric mean pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for this subgroup. In this subgroup, omeprazole treatment increased the geometric LS mean AUC 0-\u221e and C max of evacetrapib by 22% (90% CI 4-42) and 35% (90% CI 1-80), respectively ( Table 3). The subgroup's between-subject CV for AUC 0-\u221e was 50.7% (90% CI 38.2-78.8) and for C max was 61.7% (90% CI 43.1-120). As in the analysis including all subjects, for both parameters the upper bound of the 90% CI of the ratio of geometric LS means exceeded 1.25 but was less than 2, and there was no statistically significant difference in T max between the treatments.",

Seven doses of omeprazole 40 mg once/day increased mean gastric pH values across all subjects by 2.80 and increased the geometric LS mean AUC 0-\u221e and C max of evacetrapib by 15% and 30%, respectively. Given the range of the 90% CIs for AUC 0-\u221e and C max , the magnitudes of these increases are comparable. For both AUC = area under the concentration versus time curve; AUC 0-\u221e = AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity; AUC 0-tlast = AUC from time zero to the last time point with a measurable plasma concentration; %AUC tlast-\u221e = percentage of AUC 0-\u221e derived from extrapolation; CL/ F = apparent clearance; C max = maximum observed drug concentration; CV = coefficient of variation; t 1/2 = apparent terminal elimination half-life; T max = time to reach C max ; V z /F = apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase. pharmacokinetic parameters, the upper bound of the 90% CI of the ratio of geometric LS means exceeded 1.25 but was less than 2, indicating a weak interaction according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance. 17 The study's objective was to determine the effect of increased gastric pH on the pharmacokinetics of evacetrapib, not to determine the specific effect of concomitant omeprazole treatment on evacetrapib's pharmacokinetics. Omeprazole was the tool used to increase gastric pH, but because omeprazole did not accomplish this in every subject, it diluted the effect of omeprazole in the analysis across all subjects that included the subjects who did respond. To better evaluate the objective, given the poor response to omeprazole in some subjects, a subgroup analysis was conducted that included only the 22 subjects whose gastric pH was 3.0 or lower on day 1 and 4.0 or higher on day 14. By these criteria, each subject in the analysis had a pH increase of at least 1.0, and, in fact, the analysis included all subjects who had a pH increase of at least 1.0 except for one subject, whose pH increased from 6.1 at baseline to 7.3 on omeprazole. In this subpopulation, mean gastric pH increased by 4.15 during 7 days of omeprazole treatment, and geometric LS mean AUC 0-\u221e and C max of evacetrapib increased by 22% and 35%, respectively. These increases were similar to the respective 15% and 30% increases across all subjects, which indicates that the analysis across all subjects was not significantly influenced by including subjects who did not respond well to omeprazole. Despite the small mathematical differences in the two analysis groups, the overall effect is a minimal increase in evacetrapib exposure.",

After positioning the probe using the AirFLOW Sphincter Locator, gastric pH measurements were collected using the ZepHr Monitoring System and averaged over 15 minutes. This system is used clinically for measuring pH in the lower esophagus during gastric reflux episodes, and it was adapted in this study to measure pH in the stomach. The ZepHr System uses a thin flexible probe that is more comfortable and less likely to coil compared with standard nasogastric tubes often used for monitoring gastric pH. To ensure that pH measurements were being collected in the stomach, a three-tiered approach was used to confirm placement of the probe. First, the sphincter locator allowed identification of increased pressure at the LES so that the pH probe could be positioned about 10 cm AUC 0-\u221e = area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity; CI = confidence interval; C max = maximum observed drug concentration; LS = least squares; T max = time to reach C max .

Although positioning the pH probe using the AirFLOW Sphincter Locator takes slightly longer, it did not appear to cause additional discomfort to the subjects. Second, the pH gradient from the esophagus to the stomach was assessed on the recorder as the device was inserted. The pH gradient was most obvious in period 1 but was still present after 7 days of omeprazole administration in period 2. Lastly, the length of the pH probe at the nose was recorded for each subject at the time of pH recording in each period. The probe length at the nose after insertion in period 2 was compared with that of period 1 because this is unlikely to change significantly for individual subjects if the probe is placed similarly. Using these three methods to confirm proper placement into the stomach ensured that valid pH measurements were recorded for both periods. Subjects were kept at the clinical research unit for the duration of the study to ensure compliance with study restrictions and dose administration. While in the clinical research unit, subjects were given standardized meals and were fasted prior to pH measurements and evacetrapib dosing to minimize any effect of dietary variations between treatments. The recommended dose of omeprazole 20 mg once/day achieves maximal acid suppression within about 4 days, and the 40-mg omeprazole dose used in this study was expected to have a similar effect. Therefore, the evacetrapib dose administered on day 14 after the seventh dose of omeprazole was given after maximal suppression of gastric acid secretion had been attained.",
