Methods Data of 189 patients with acute anterior MI who had a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the first 12 h from the onset of symptoms between January 2004 and December 2008 were retrospective analyzed. Left anterior descending arteries (LAD) of all patients were occluded. LADs were reopened with primary PCI. According to the collateral circulation, all patients were classified to two groups: no collateral group (n = 111), patients without angiographic collateral filling of LAD or side branches (collateral index 0) and collateral group (n = 78), and patients with angiographic collateral filling of LAD or side branches (collateral index 1, 2 or 3). At one year's follow-up, the occurrence of death, reinfarction, stent thrombosis (ST), target vessel revascularization and readmission because of heart failure were observed. Results At one year, the mortality was lower in patients with collateral circulation compared with those without collateral circulation (1% vs. 8%, P = 0.049), whereas there were no differences in the occurrence of reinfarction, ST, target vessel revascularization and readmission because of heart failure. The occurrence of composite of endpoint was lower in patients with collateral circulation compared with those without collateral circulation (12% vs. 26%; P = 0.014). Conclusions Pre-exist collateral circulation may prefigure the satisfactory prognosis to the patients with acute anterior MI after primary PCI in the first 12 h of MI onset.",

            "text": "Anterior infarcts often leads to unsatisfactory prognosis because of impaired left ventricular function. Anterior infarcts are associated with a larger enzymatic infarct size and greater reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) compared with nonanterior infarcts. [1] Reperfusion of the occluded coronary artery early after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) limits infarct size, improvers LVEF, and enhances survival. [2] In some patients, collateral circulations will emerge shortly after the coronary arteries' occlusion. It is unknown what is the role of collateral circulation in prognosis of the patients with anterior AMI after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The main purpose of the present study was to find the effect of collateral circulation on patients' outcome in the patients with anterior AMI who had primary PCI within the first 12 h from the onset of symptoms.",

Coronary angiography and primary PCI were performed in the first 12 h from the onset of symptoms of AMI. Once the radial or femoral artery was catheterized, 5000 IU of heparin was administered with additional boluses of 2000 IU if needed to achieve an activated clotting time of 250 s to 350 s. Coronary arteriograms were obtained in at least two projections. Flow in the LAD was determined before and after primary PCI and graded as described in the TIMI trial. [4] The LAD occlusion was considered proximal if it was located before the origin of the first well developed septal branch, distal if it was located after the origin of the third diagonal branch and mid if located between these limits. [5] Primary PCI was performed with conventional catheter balloon technique. [6] Stents were used routinely in the target lesion. The policy was to perform angioplasty only to the infarct-related artery, but in exceptional cases additional angioplasty to another vessel was performed because of compromised hemodynamic status. Intraaortic balloon pumping was used in patients with hemodynamic instability or established cardiogenic shock. The primary PCI was considered successful when flow in the infarctrelated artery at the end of the procedure was TIMI grade 3 and the residual stenosis was less than 30%.",

Howerer, the functional significance of collateral circulation in AMI has been a matter of debate for many years. [7][8] It has been traditionally assumed that coronary arteries are functional end arteries in the absence of stenoses, but it also was reported that there are functional collateral vessels to the extent in humans with angiographically normal coronary arteries. [9] Factors that may influence the presence of collaterals after the onset of AMI have been demonstrated in previous clinical studies. The recruitment of collateral circulation is affected by the presence of multivessel disease, [10] preinfarction angina, [5] history of angina pectoris, [11] time from onset to cardiac catheterization. [12] It was reported that collateral circulation did not exert a protective effect in patients who underwent primary PCI. In that paper, the author didn't analyse the outcome of patients with anterior AMI and only chose the patients with AMI in the first six hours of AMI onset. [13] The patients with LAD-related infarcts had a worse prognosis compared with the patients with non-LAD-related infarcts because of a lower residual LVEF. [1] So, the study for collateral circulation to the LAD-related infarcts may be important.",

            "text": "In the first six hours of AMI onset, 17% of patients with anterior AMI were found angiographic collateral circulation. [13] In other study, collateral circulations were visible in nearly 40% of patient with AMI. [14] In the present study, collateral circulation to the occluded LAD is found by angiography whithin the first 12 h of AMI onset in 41% of patients with anterior AMI. The percent of the patients with collateral circulation in the first six hours of AMI was 24%. The pressure-derived fractional collateral flow was measured in 70 patients with AMI onset in the first 12 h. It was found that the left ventricular recovery after reperfused AMI was primarily determined by pressure-derived fractional collateral flow and was less dependent on time to reperfusion in patients with collaterals. [15] Time to reperfusion is important for survival with thrombolytic therapy. [16,17] Improverment in ejection fraction was substantial with reperfusion at less than two hours but was relatively independent of time to reperfusion after two hours. The mortality was independent of time to reperfusion. [18] It has been suggested that some reasons why time to treatment may be less important with primary PCI than thrombolytic therapy might be possible. First, TIMI 2 to 3 flow is achieved less often with increasing time to treatment with thrombolytic therapy. [19] In contrast, TIMI 3 flow was achieved in a high percentage of patients regardless of time to treatment with primary PCI. Second, in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy, mortality rates from myocarrdial rupture increased progressively with increasing time to treatment.In contrast, mortality rates due to myocardial rupture after primary PCI are very low. [20] Third, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage after thrombolytic therapy increased with increasing time to treatment. [17] The occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage with primary PCI is rare. [21] In our study, collateral circulation was an dependent factor for the composite endpoint, and the symptom to treatment time was not an dependent factor. It was suggested that the time to reperfusion was a crucial factor for the prognosis of patient with AMI in the first hours onset (possible two hours or six hours or other) and the benefit of reperfusion would decrease after the first hours AMI onset. The presence of collateral circulation at this time point may improve myocardial salvage [22][23] and prevent ventricular remodeling, [24] thereby improving prognosis independent of coronary reperfusion therapy. [25] In the present study, the patients with collateral coronary circulation had better prognosis than it in the patient without collateral coronary circulation when the patients with AMI accepted primary PCI in the first six hours of syndrome to treatment time. The patients with AMI with collateral coronary circulation accepted primary PCI between 6 h and 12 h of syndrome to treatment time had a better prognosis tendency compared with the patients without collateral coronary circulation. The patients with collateral coronary circulation accepting primary PCI between 6 h and 12 h of syndrome to treatment time had better prognosis than it in the patients without collateral coronary circulation accepting primary PCI in the first 6 h of syndrome to treatment time. These results suggest that finding a way to gaining the collateral coronary circulation earlier might give a better prognosis to the patients with AMI. It has been found that basic fibroblast growth factor enhances collateral development, reduces infarct size and improves cardiac function. [26] Some potential limitations need to be addressed. First, the sum of sample is not a larger number. Second, some data, such as peak creatine kinase myocardial band and left ventricular ejection fraction at one year were not collected completely. So, the infarction area and the function of left ventricle were not evaluated accurately.",
