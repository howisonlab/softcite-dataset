            "text": "The anticommons in knowledge is distinct from the anticommons in physical objects. The former is always tragic, the latter not necessarily so. For society at large, the tragedy of the anticommons is more serious when it involves knowledge than when it involves physical resources. Buchanan and Yoon's (2000) formal model of the anticommons is incorrect even within the neoclassical context, and their neoliberal suggestion that single ownership is the socially optimal solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is misleading. This article argues that the only, epistemically and socially beneficial solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is to create, expand, and protect the knowledge commons. The article also constructs a simple formal model based on Bessen and Maskin's (2006) sequential model, as a metaphor for how the comedy of the knowledge commons works. The analysis supports the worldwide movement for free knowledge, and dissents from the evolving political and academic consensus in China in favor of more restrictive intellectual property regimes."

Meanwhile each fancies that no harm will come of his neglect, that it is the business of somebody else to look after this or that for him; and so, by the same notion being entertained by all separately, the common cause imperceptibly decays\" (Thucydides n.d.: book 1, chapter 5;Heller 2008: 208). Aristotle, in his Politics, noted that \"that which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it. Every one thinks chiefly of his own, hardly at all of the common interest; and only when he is himself concerned as an individual\" (Aristotle n.d.: book 2; Heller 2008: 16, 208). article in Danish published by Jens Warming, a Danish economist, in 1911 2 and an article published by H. Scott Gordon in 1954(RSAS 2009Gordon 1954). Katharine Coman's \"Some Unsettled Problems of Irrigation,\" published in the first issue of the American Economic Review in 1911, also addressed the problem (Coman 1911;Ostrom 2011;Libecap 2011). In 1968, the ecologist Garrett James Hardin popularized concerns about the misuse of common property resources with a widely referenced article entitled \"The Tragedy of the Commons\" in the journal Science (Hardin 1968;RSAS 2009).",

Some reviewers may have been attracted to the mathematical beauty in Buchanan and Yoon's (2000) formal model, in which the anticommons and commons problems are shown to be 2 As cited by RSAS (2009), the article is Jens Warming (1911). \"Om grundrente av fiskegrunde.\" National\u00f8konomisk Tidsskrift 49: 499-505. English translation Peder Andersen (1983). \"'On rent of fishing grounds': A translation of Jens Warming's 1911 article, with an introduction,\" trans. Peder Andersen and Kirsten Stentoft. History of Political Economy 15 (3) (Fall): 391-396. 3  Hess and Ostrom (2006) noted that the word commons \"is used for both the singular and plural forms.\" They (2006) also noted that for the general term commons there is differentiation between a commons as a shared resource or resource system which is called common-pool resources and independent of particular property rights, and a commons as a property-rights regime which is called common property and is a legal regime, a jointly owned legal set of rights. 4 As cited by Heller (1998), Michelman's 1982article is Frank I. Michelman (1982. \"Ethics, economics, and the law of property.\" In Ethics, economics, and the law (NOMOS series -24), ed. J. Roland Pennock and John W. Chapman. New York University Press. 5 For example, Adam Smith in his The Wealth of Nations noted that the commerce \"which any nation can carry on by means of a river which does not break itself into any great number of branches or canals, and which runs into another territory before it reaches the sea, can never be very considerable; because it is always in the power of the nations who possess that other territory to obstruct the communication between the upper country and the sea\" (Smith 1789: book 1, chapter 3, paragraph 8). symmetrical in several respects. However, on the one hand, their formulation is incorrect even within the neoclassical context, because they mistook some basic concepts that are at least as old as what was considered by Jules Dupuit (Coloma 2003)  6 ; on the other hand, even if it were correct within the neoclassical context, their formal model should be still ideological rather than universally true, as is the case with most other neoclassical economic models. For example, the model ignores several dimensions of intellectual property issues explored in heterodox economics. 7 This article discusses the tragedy of the anticommons with respect to a special category, \"knowledge,\" which is distinct from physical objects. While Heller and Eisenberg (1998) and Heller (2008: 76-78) warned that the privatization of biomedical research \"risks creating a tragedy of the anticommons through a proliferation of fragmented and overlapping intellectual property rights,\" they did not generalize their criticism of intellectual property rights. Instead they claimed that the tragedy of underuse arising out of the biomedical anticommons \"is distinct from the routine underuse inherent in any well-functioning patent system.\" This article challenges that delimitation, and argues that intellectual property per se is the very source of the tragedy of the anticommons in knowledge and that the tragedy is unavoidable so long as an intellectual property regime exists.",

The second section analyzes both the anticommons in knowledge, which is distinct from the anticommons in physical objects, and the tragedy of the anticommons in knowledge. This is followed by a third section that refutes the neoliberal argument that single ownership is the socially optimal solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons. The fourth section argues that the only epistemically and socially beneficial solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is to create, expand, and protect the knowledge commons. In the fifth section, a simple model based on Bessen and Maskin's (2006) sequential model is constructed as a metaphor for how the comedy of the knowledge commons works. The last section is the conclusion.",

In that year Antoine Augustin Cournot published his Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth, which included his \"complementary monopoly\" theory (Sonnenschein 1968;Heller 2008: 42). Hugo Sonnenschein in a 1968 article demonstrated a formal duality between Cournot's theory of duopoly and his theory of complementary monopoly (Sonnenschein 1968;Feinberg and Kamien 2001;Gardner, Gaston, and Masson 2002). Nirvikar Singh and Xavier Vives in a 1984 article provided a general treatment of the duality between Cournot competition and Bertrand competition, showing that oligopolists selling complementary products will choose to compete over price rather than output (Singh and Vives 1984;Gardner, Gaston, and Masson 2002). The methodology these and other researches provided has been adopted by some scholars for investigating the regime of anticommons and for economic modeling of the anticommons.",

In the words of Michael Polanyi, \"[i]t tries to parcel up a stream of creative thought into a series of distinct claims, each of which is to constitute the basis of a separately owned monopoly,\" and tries to divide up \"the growth of human knowledge. . .into such sharply circumscribed phases\" (Polanyi 1944;Machlup 1958). In that case, each owner, i.e. the monopolist of each fragment of \"knowledge,\" has the right to exclude others from using that fragment, and thus no one will have the freedom to use the whole stream of that \"knowledge.\" The anticommons in knowledge so created poses a dire threat to the growth of human knowledge. For example, as Heller and Eisenberg (1998) mentioned, \"[p]rivatization of upstream biomedical research in the United States may create anticommons property that is less visible than empty storefronts but even more economically and socially costly.\" Second, when there are significant pervasive negative externalities of use of physical resources, an anticommons in physical objects may be a better regime for social welfare because of less use of the resources, whereas with an anticommons in knowledge that is not the case. The loss of positive externalities from an anticommons in knowledge creation is unlikely to be offset by reductions in the negative externalities accompanying knowledge creation.",

Coloma (2003) corrected and improved Buchanan and Yoon's (2000) model within the neoclassical context, taking externalities into account for the problem of the commons by introducing a specific cost function. But his model only considered a so-called reciprocal externality, which is a localized negative externality. He did not consider negative externalities on environments outside the commons property, which are pervasive negative externalities. For the problem of the anticommons, his model considered neither the localized negative externalities nor the pervasive negative externalities. When negative externalities are pervasive and significant, as is often the case, less use of the resources as a result of the anticommons regime than the \"efficient\" quantity determined in either Buchanan and Yoon's (2000) or Coloma's (2003) model may be better for social welfare. In some circumstances, even no use of resources as a result of an anticommons regime under Michelman's definition 9 may be the best use. Two examples of the latter are Robert Ellickson's hypothetical wilderness preserve, which \"'any person' has standing to enforce,\" and James Krier's hypothetical nuclear-waste dump, which is so dangerous that everyone \"has standing to exclude\" (Heller 1998: 667, 668, note 214, note 215, and note 216).",

In reality, however, there exists the potential for coordination and cooperation between multiple owners (excluders) in an anticommons, \"with success more likely within close-knit communities than among hostile strangers\" (Heller and Eisenberg 1998;Heller 1998: 625, and note 17). 10 When pervasive negative externalities are minor, such cooperation, if successful, will improve social welfare by reducing the extent of underuse. The result of the successful cooperation may be an equilibrium where these owners' (excluders') total surplus is maximized, the same as the equilibrium under the single ownership, where the single owner's total surplus is maximized, as shown by Buchanan and Yoon (2000). Buchanan and Yoon's (2000) analysis suggested that the equilibrium under either the single ownership or efficient collective management is socially optimal, but the suggestion is incorrect even according to neoclassical standards. The equilibrium point, with less quantity supplied and higher price, actually deviates from the \"true,\" socially optimal point, where the average revenue given by the demand function is equal to the social marginal cost, as shown in Coloma's (2003) model, which corrected and reformulated Buchanan and Yoon's (2000) model within the neoclassical context. 11 The deviation derives from the market power that the single owner has or the multiple owners 9 Heller (1998) defined anticommons property as \"a property regime in which multiple owners hold effective rights of exclusion in a scarce resource.\" The distinction between Michelman's and Heller's (1998) definition is important. The former can be understood as an open-access anticommons, which Robert C. Ellickson argued may be rare and for which a threshold requirement of \"near simultaneous unanimous consent,\" which will be nearly impossible to achieve, ensures that the property will not be used by anyone (Heller 1998). The latter can be understood as a limited-access anticommons, in which a limited group of owners have rights of exclusion and which Ellickson argued appears more often (See Heller 1998: 667, 668, 669, and note 218). In the commons/anticommons duality, it is obvious that an open-access anticommons and a limited-access anticommons correspond to an open-access commons and a limited-access commons respectively. RSAS (2009), for example, mentioned the cases of \"open access\" and \"a fixed number of users\" for a commons. 10 Obviously, an anticommons in a close-knit community is a limited-access anticommons. 11 Coloma (2003) pointed out that in fact the tragedy of the commons does not exist in Buchanan and Yoon's (2000) model aimed at illustrating both the commons tragedy and the anticommons tragedy, because their model does not include any cost function. Instead, Coloma's (2003) model introduces a cost function for each owner (user) such that each owner's (user's) private marginal cost is lower than the social marginal cost, which represents the reciprocal externality among the owners (users) that creates the tragedy of the commons.",

That is to say, when the pervasive negative externalities are modest, cooperation between the multiple owners (excluders) in the anticommons in physical objects, even if successful, will not eliminate the tragedy of underuse. 12 This point is also true of the anticommons in knowledge. For example, when patents are blocking, efficiency would be improved by their joint use, which \"could be brought about either by the sale of all the patents to a single firm (whether one of the patentees or a different firm altogether) or by a cross-licensing agreement that would permit each of the firms to use all the patents\" (Landes and Posner 2003: 383). Such joint use, however, would not be socially optimal, because the single firm would have very strong market power or the result of the cross-licensing agreement \"may be to disguise a cartel as a lawful patent monopoly\" (Landes and Posner 2003: 383). This is the reason why patent pooling and cross-licensing on the patent side or the blanket licensing on the copyright side have been targets of careful antitrust scrutiny (Landes and Posner 2003: 382, 383;Heller and Eisenberg 1998;Heller 2008: 72, 73, 196). Furthermore, it is particularly noteworthy that the result of the insiders' cooperation through these voluntary agreements is that access to and the free use and distribution of the \"knowledge\" by outside competitors and society at large will be restricted or blocked to a greater extent and therefore the positive knowledge externalities will be inhibited more significantly.",

However, even if concerns about the adequacy of collecting rights into single ownership as a response to the underuse problems caused by an anticommons could be overcome, other problems remain. In practice \"it is easier to fragment than to reconvene fragmented property\" (Parisi, Schulz, and Depoorter 2004;Heller 2008: 213). As Heller pointed out, collecting rights from an anticommons into usable private property bundles is often brutal and slow, and both markets and governments may fail to do so (Heller 1998;Heller and Eisenberg 1998). For example, \"[l]and is much easier to break up than to put back together.\" Eminent domain is one way to unlock the value frozen in gridlocked land, \"but it's a crude solution\" (Heller 2008: 110, 111). 13 Obviously, it is even harder to solve the cross-border anticommons tragedy at the international level resulting from fragmented sovereignty, as Adam Smith observed in 1776 in The Wealth of Nations: \"The navigation of the Danube is of very little use to the different states of Bavaria, Austria and Hungary, in comparison of what it would be if any of them possessed the whole of its course till it falls into the Black Sea\"(Smith 1789: book 1, chapter 3, paragraph 8; Buchanan and Yoon 2000;Heller 2008: 182, 183). 14 The above points seem also true of the anticommons in knowledge. Both markets and governments may find it difficult to dissolve barriers to knowledge production assembled under privatization. For example, one program can infringe many different software patents at once. Linux, the kernel of the GNU/Linux operating system, may have infringed as many as 283 different U.S. software patents (Stallman 2005). A company that developed a treatment for Alzheimer's disease found it could not bring it to market unless it bought access to dozens of patents and \"[a]ny single patent owner could demand a huge payoff; some blocked the whole deal\" (Heller 2008: xiii). A final point to remember is that in this emerging new era of technocapitalism, 15 even if these formidable obstacles to consolidation can be overcome, the intellectual monopoly created will likely be detrimental to the diversity and dynamics of knowledge development, replacing the \"tragedy\" of the anticommons with the \"Sargasso Sea\" of monopoly.",

The holdout story in Chongqing, China behind the pictures was in the media spotlight in 2007. 14 In the commons context, on the one hand, single ownership will not eliminate underuse, if pervasive externalities are minor; on the other hand, even to the extent that in some circumstances single ownership may mitigate overuse of resources, the problem is that \"most common property resources are vast\" and it is not practical to privatize them (Pindyck and Rubinfeld 2001: 643). It may be practical to privatize the parking lot discussed in Buchanan and Yoon's (2000) model and assign usage and exclusion rights to a single owner, but \"the air and waters surrounding us cannot readily be fenced\" and therefore single ownership is by no means a way of solving such commons tragedies as a massive extinction of species in the oceans of the world, water and air pollution, and overpopulation (or what Hardin called the tragedy of \"the commons in breeding\") (Hardin 1968). 15 I thank two of the reviewers of this article for their suggestion that I pay attention to this new version of capitalism. Douglas Kellner appeared to have coined the term \"technocapitalism\" in 1989 (Kellner 2003: 31;Shaw 2008: 26). According to Luis Suarez-Villa, technocapitalism is \"a new form of capitalism that is heavily grounded on corporate power and its exploitation of technological creativity\" (Suarez-Villa 2001. \"Meta-externalities\" refer to the unintended consequences of legal and economic activities that can affect the broad contours of society and culture. Heterodox economists attend to them, while neoclassical economists usually ignore them (Cohn 2007: 17, 49, 335). Many heterodox economists are uneasy about the cultural and social implications of inhibiting free access to knowledge and information by society at large. Many philosophers find that privatizing and commercializing the results of scientific research-particularly patenting the results of research-is both epistemically and socially detrimental due to similar concerns (Biddle 2012).",

Free access to knowledge will not be a disincentive to the creation of inventions and literary and artistic works. The real incentives for human knowledge creation are not financial as assumed in an intellectual property regime. The quest for knowledge is rooted in human nature. Ultimately, people produce knowledge \"for the same reason that a silk worm produces silk\" (Marx 1862-1863: addenda to part I). Natural incentives and passions for knowledge creation exist among pure (basic) researchers, artists, and numerous others conducting applied research in academic communities and elsewhere.

Actually, the current intellectual property regimes may impede both sustainability-enhancing innovations and knowledge dissemination (Henry and Stiglitz 2010) and distort research toward 17 By contrast, Ostrom pointed out many cases in which governmentally imposed restrictions were counterproductive and central government intervention had created more chaos than order (RSAS 2009). 18 Particularly, locally evolved institutional arrangements governed by stable communities often fail when rapid change occurs (Dietz, Ostrom, and Stern 2003), and the cooperative mechanisms which have been proven successful in small-scale, local commons may break down if they are employed to solve the problems of larger and even global commons, such as critical problems of transboundary pollution, tropical deforestation, and climate change (Heller 2008: 25;RSAS 2009;Dietz, Ostrom, and Stern, 2003;Stavins 2011). 19 For citizens of a particular country, SOEs are something like what Aristotle described as property \"belonging to them, not severally but collectively,\" and the mainstream economists seem to consider the SOE dilemma as similar to the situation in which, as Aristotle described, \"[e]ach citizen will have a thousand sons who will not be his sons individually but anybody will be equally the son of anybody, and will therefore be neglected by all alike\" (Aristotle n.d.: book 2). Heller (2008: 34) argued that \"[i]n recent years, state property has become less central as a theoretical category\" and that \"[i]n a sense, state property has lost its special character.\" But, so far as I know, that is not the case at least in China, the world's most populous country and second largest economy, and outside China, at least the World Bank has not become less interested in the state property in China (for example, Wei 2012; Flanagan 2012; Back 2012). For my opinion on the SOEs in China, see Zhou (2009). unsustainable projects. The commodification of intellectual creativity entails wholesale dispossessions (Harvey 2003). 20 According to Henry and Stiglitz (2010), experience with genetically modified organisms shows that an open source model of research and production markedly different from the more traditional models based on protection of intellectual property is more likely to bring wider social benefits, both in the short and the long run. Williams's (2013) empirical study also suggested that the private firm Celera's short-term gene-level IP had persistent negative effects on subsequent innovation relative to a counterfactual of Celera genes having always been in the public domain.",

[t]o the best of my knowledge, there exists no direct evidence on how gene patents have affected subsequent product development,\" Bessen and Maskin's (2006) sequential model showed that patents may inhibit sequential and complementary innovation while \"imitators can provide benefit to both the original inventor and to society more generally.\" They (2006) noted that it is in industries like software or computers that innovation is both sequential and complementary. Actually, however, sequentiality and complementarity is the very essence of almost all activities of knowledge creation. 21 Therefore, patents will be counterproductive in almost all industries, in which innovation is always sequential and complementary (Bessen and Maskin 2006;Landes and Posner 2003: 326, 327, 366). Bessen and Maskin's (2006) sequential model showed that in a regime with patent protection, the threshold at which a firm with a higher cost does R&D when it has no patent is less than that at which the firm with a patent does R&D. 22 In the United States, the firms that obtained the most software patents actually reduced their R&D spending relative to sales after patent protection was strengthened. In Japan, there was no concomitant increase in R&D or innovation after the Japanese patent system was significantly strengthened starting in the late 1980s. These results are quite consistent with the sequential model of innovation, but are difficult to reconcile with the orthodox incentive theory of patents (Bessen and Hunt 2004;Bessen and Maskin 2006). Bessen and Maskin's (2006) sequential model also showed that expected net social welfare will most 20 Once again, I thank two of the reviewers of this article for their respective suggestions that I pay attention to the related works of Joseph Stiglitz and David Harvey. 21 In Bessen and Maskin's (2006) sequential model, in which there is an industry consisting of two (ex ante symmetric) firms, and for each invention a firm's cost of R&D is either C = c (with probability q) or C = 0 (with probability 1 \u2212 q) (here the smaller realization was chosen by them to be zero merely for analytic convenience and they noted that all the results hold with a positive lower cost), the sequentiality of innovation is represented by assuming that there is an infinite sequence of potential inventions (indexed by t = 1, 2, ...), each of which has direct social value v drawn from c, d, f, F(v), and that \"if invention t has not yet been discovered, then there is no chance that innovation t + 1 will be developed,\" and the complementarity of innovation is represented by assuming that p 1 , \"the probability that innovation t + 1 is discovered conditional on the current invention t having already been discovered,\" if just one firm undertakes R&D, is smaller than p 2 , the corresponding conditional probability that at least one firm will discover innovation t + 1, if both firms undertake R&D. 22  Bessen and Maskin's (2006) sequential model showed that in a regime with patent protection, v 00 .",

For applied research and technology innovations in the direct production process in the economy, the flourishing free software/open source movements, which embody passions for knowledge creation, altruism, and volunteering for free knowledge, and a new system of governance other than the \"market\" or the \"firm,\" the traditional system of governance, are providing spiritual direction (See Zhou 2010Zhou , 2011 , then this indicates that though it gains from more investment in R&D by firms, society loses to a greater extent from a lower rate of knowledge spillover and diffusion. This situation may arise from some extent of \"natural monopoly\" in knowledge by the firms, which is different from and usually weaker than intellectual monopoly in the form of intellectual property.

Actually, intellectual property per se is the very source of the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons, and the tragedy is unavoidable so long as the intellectual property regime exists. The only epistemically and socially beneficial solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is to create, expand, and protect the knowledge commons. The comedy of the knowledge commons comes from the positive meta-externalities of performance of the knowledge commons. Some heterodox formal models can be constructed as metaphors for how the comedy works."
