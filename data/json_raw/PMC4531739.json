It can pick up new subjects who are not classified as diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance by WHO criteria. However, a substantial number of subjects, who may have increased cardiovascular ris k and/or increased risk for the development of diabetes , will be missed when using only FPG cutpoint. Long term study will be needed to evaluate whether glucose tolerance categories classified by ADA fasting criteria will result in decreased morbidity and mortality, compared to those according to WHO criteria.",
