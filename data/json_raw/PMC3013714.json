            "text": "Large numbers of long RNAs with little or no protein-coding potential [long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)] are being identified in eukaryotes. In parallel, increasing data describing the expression profiles, molecular features and functions of individual lncRNAs in a variety of systems are accumulating. To enable the systematic compilation and updating of this information, we have developed a database (lncRNAdb) containing a comprehensive list of lncRNAs that have been shown to have, or to be associated with, biological functions in eukaryotes, as well as messenger RNAs that have regulatory roles. Each entry contains referenced information about the RNA, including sequences, structural information, genomic context, expression, subcellular localization, conservation, functional evidence and other relevant information. lncRNAdb can be searched by querying published RNA names and aliases, sequences, species and associated protein-coding genes, as well as terms contained in the annotations, such as the tissues in which the transcripts are expressed and associated diseases. In addition, lncRNAdb is linked to the UCSC Genome Browser for visualization and Noncoding RNA Expression Database (NRED) for expression information from a variety of sources. lncRNAdb provides a platform for the ongoing collation of the literature pertaining to lncRNAs and their association with other genomic elements. lncRNAdb can be accessed at: http://www .lncrnadb.org/."

            "text": "The eukaryotic transcriptome is enormous, and comprises not only a large set of protein-coding messenger RNAs, but also large numbers of non-protein coding transcripts that have structural, regulatory or unknown functions (1). Noncoding RNAs include intergenic transcripts as well as a complex array of RNAs that overlap protein-coding loci on both strands (2-4), including promoter-associated RNAs (4), intronic RNAs (5), convergent and bi-directional transcripts (3), noncoding alternatively spliced isoforms of protein-coding genes (6) and mRNAs that also have regulatory roles as untranslated RNAs (7,8). While some of these RNAs are processed to form small RNA species such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), many can have diverse roles as primary or spliced long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) (9). In structural terms, lncRNAs range in size from approximately 100 to 100 000 bases, can be spliced or unspliced, polyadenylated or non-polyadenylated, nuclear or cytoplasmic, and are usually transcribed by RNA polymerase II and/or III (10).",

While there are databases cataloguing ncRNAs, these have been predominantly focused on well-validated classes of small RNAs and contain limited data pertaining to lncRNAs. Recently, a database with diverse information on imprinted RNAs was made available, which is largely comprised of small RNAs, such as piRNAs (piwi-interacting RNAs), but also contains imprinted lncRNAs, and is restricted to mammals (19). Our previous database of noncoding RNAs, RNAdb (20), was also limited to mammals, and included all classes of regulatory RNAs, such as snoRNAs, piRNAs and miRNAs. Due to the rapid expansion in each of these classes, they are now independently curated in dedicated databases, including miRbase (21), piRNAbank (22) and Sno/scaRNAbase (23). Consequently, there is a need for a dedicated database of lncRNAs that includes not only mammalian lncRNAs, but detailed annotations of lncRNAs from all eukaryotic species.",

In an effort to make a clear distinction to small RNA species and to create a more biologically meaningful definition of lncRNAs, we consider lncRNAs as noncoding RNAs that may have a function as either primary or spliced transcripts, which is independent of processing into known classes of small RNAs, such as miRNAs, piRNAs and snoRNAs, while also excluding structural RNAs from classical housekeeping families (tRNAs, snoRNAs, spliceosomal RNAs, etc). Existing databases and archives, including Sno/scaRNAbase (23), miRBase (21), tRNAdb-CE (34) and piRNAbank (22), already represent such ncRNAs. However, some lncRNAs that are host genes for small RNA species (35,36), but may also have roles as regulatory lncRNAs, have been included in the annotations. An example is the GAS5 lncRNA, which is a repressor of the glucocorticoid receptor but also encodes several intronic snoRNAs (37).",

            "text": "An emerging class of genes is those encoding bifunctional RNAs, which can have multiple independent roles, such as acting as a regulatory lncRNA or being translated into a protein. Examples include well-known lncRNAs such as the co-activator SRA transcript, isoforms of which also encode a protein (8,63), and known protein coding genes, such as p53, whose transcripts also act as regulatory RNAs (7). In some cases, splicing isoforms are known to encode a protein, whereas specific splicing isoforms encode regulatory lncRNAs, such as the LXRB/ LXRBSV isoform pair (6).",

These regions are transcribed into lncRNAs that have been characterized to some extent at the structural and/ or expression level, including dozens of lncRNAs that show tissue specificity and dynamic expression during development (64), as well as cellular localization, suggestive of undiscovered functionality. Likewise, the database also includes transcripts such as PHO5 antisense lncRNA in yeast (65) where it is not yet established whether the functional role is conveyed by the lncRNA or its transcription."

            "text": "The data in lncRNAdb will be extended through manual curation by the authors and submissions to the site by other researchers on an ongoing basis. The lowering cost and improved depths of RNA-sequencing methodologies is already enabling transcriptomics studies for alternative model-and non-model species, and it is expected that the identification and characterization of lncRNAs will follow, which may substantially increase the representation of non-mammalian species in the database. New functionality will be included with integration of the publicly available successor to NRED (NRED2) early in 2011, giving access to not only additional microarray expression data but also transcriptomic RNA-seq data for contextually related long noncoding and coding genes, tools for visualization of the lncRNA and cross-referencing of experimental expression profiles. Finally, the absence of a centralized database of lncRNAs is reflected by the ad hoc naming of newly identified members, which are often not self-consistent and potentially confusing. With the number of functional lncRNAs likely to be very large, it will be important to establish a standardized nomenclature to minimize confusion and allow this emerging field to be as accessible as possible to all biologists."
