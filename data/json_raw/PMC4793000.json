[Subject and Methods] The workers were evaluated for pulmonary function and peak expiratory flow (PEF), respiratory symptoms, smoking habits, and physical activity level. Descriptive statistical analysis and ANOVA one-way test were used. [Results] The mean age was 33.9 \u00b1 8.25 years (18-59), pulmonary function: FVC: 95 \u00b1 18% of predicted, FEV 1 : 95.0 \u00b1 15.8% of predicted, FEV 1 /FVC ratio of 0.82 \u00b1 0.09, and PEF = 499.7 \u00b1 118.5 l/min. Overall, 85.1% of workers were classified that physically active, 7.93% of workers reported respiratory symptoms, and 14.28% reported being smokers. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the variables of lung function. [Conclusion] The pulmonary function is preserved in foundry workers independently of exposure time.",

Usually this occurs in poorly ventilated closed areas, characterizing it as a job that puts employees at high risk of occupational exposure via inhalation [2][3][4] .",

The main advantages of the PEF are cost, effectiveness, and ease of use [7][8][9][11][12][13][14] .

All participants signed informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (protocol 0048.1.1186.000-10). All workers who performed their duties while exposed to high temperatures from ovens were selected to this study. Workers were excluded due to various reasons such as dismissal, sick leave, or refusal to participate. All participants performed spirometry (EasyOne TM, model 2001) according to the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society protocol (2005) at their workplace. The values are expressed as a percentage of the predicted values obtained in Brazilian subjects 15) . The measurement of peak expiratory flow was performed following three rapid exhalations by the patient (Mini Wright Standard with a flow between 60 and 800 l/min). The best result among them was used. Anthropometrics measure (height and weight) of the participants were performed using the Microlife brand, previously calibrated stadiometer (Sany). To evaluate the activity level of the workers, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form was used. The questions are related to the time spent engaging in physical activity in a typical week/habitual. People were considered active if they had accumulated more than 150 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity per week 16) . Then, a routine physical examination and evaluation of previous medical history; respiratory signs and symptoms, according to a respiratory disease's questionnaire; smoking history; and checklist were implemented. The dyspnea was assessed by Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea scale 17) . The foundry workers were classified according to exposure time in High (>5 years) and Low exposure groups (\u2264 5 years). A control group consisted of administrative area workers from the same industry. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was used to analyze the data distribution. The data were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis, mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni adjusted was used to determine whether there are significant differences between groups (\u03b1<5%). The statistical analysis was performed using the Sigma Stat software package, version 3.2 (San Jose, EUA).",

On the other hand, workers exposed to iron considered that the risk is lower when there is an association with iron and other metals, such as silica 27) . We observed that both the enterprise and the workers were concerned about compliance and correct use of PPE. Wang et al. 28) observed significant reduction in FEV 1 in individuals exposed to a series of secondary factors to the occupational environment, where the use of PPE was positively correlated with no changes in FEV 1 .
