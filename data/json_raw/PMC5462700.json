            "text": "Balancing ability is defined as the ability to maintain the body's center of gravity while minimizing sway in the base of support. Postural balance, on the other hand, indicates the ability to continuously retain balance in accordance with the center of mass (COM) and movement, and to maintain the proper postural control against actions and external rocking within the base of support 1,2) . Gait training is a common method of improving the balancing ability. It is recommended for aerobic capacity improvement, body fat reduction, lowering the blood pressure, improving insulin sensitivity, and improving gait and balancing abilities 3) . Research testing the effects of gait training examines types and speed of walking. Underwater walking training is special in that it provides a work-out environment of reduced gravity with the use of the buoyancy of water 3) . Water workouts relieve stress from weight on the joints, enhances muscular function without imposing excessive impact to the muscle, and improves flexibility and balance 4) .",

The balance test was performed by a physical therapist who had completed the course for the balance test method and was experienced in clinical practice for over three years. To measure balance function, the subject was instructed to stand on a triangle platform and maintain a symmetrical posture with the feet shoulder width apart. A visual fixed point was located in front of the subject to minimize head movements. The subject's arms were placed comfortably at the hip joints and the center of pressure (COP) was measured for 30 seconds in the standing posture with the eyes open. COP was measured three times and average values were calculated. The software also calculates several variables describing the quantitative aspects of individual's test behaviour, e.g. amount and speed of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway, amplitude of sway, the first moment of sway velocity (combined amplitude and velocity of the movement of the center of pressure), power spectrum analysis (FFT analysis) etc. Low score of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway implies excellent balance ability. The index of balance function score ranges between 0 and 100, and a higher score implies greater balance ability to perform the task. A reliable and valid measurement of the functioning of posture control mechanisms is a prerequisite for discovering the reasons for balance problems or evaluating the effects of treatment and rehabilitation.",
