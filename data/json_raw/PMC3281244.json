Although many compounds have been identified which inhibit accumulation or dissolve fibrils and aggregates in vitro there is no therapeutic treatment to stop these progressive neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe the effects of the traditional medicinal herb Scutellaria lateriflora (S. lateriflora) and its natural compounds, the flavonoids baicalein and baicalin, on the development of prion disease using in vitro and in vivo models. S. lateriflora extract as well as both constituents reduced the PrP res accumulation in scrapie-infected cell cultures and cell-free conversion assays and lead to the destabilization of pre-existing PrP Sc fibrils. Moreover, tea prepared from S. lateriflora, prolonged significantly the incubation time of scrapie-infected mice upon oral treatment. Therefore S. lateriflora extracts as well as the individual compounds can be considered as promising candidates for the development of new therapeutic drugs against TSEs and other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.",

            "text": "Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are neurodegenerative diseases which are characterized by the accumulation and deposition of a pathogenic isoform (PrP Sc ) of the host encoded cellular prion protein (PrP C ) designated PrP Sc . Both isoforms share the same amino acid sequence but differ in conformation, resistance to proteinase K (PK), and pathogenicity. PrP Sc tends to oligomerize by a seeded polymerization mechanism followed by the formation of multimers and eventually of fibril structures. This aggregation can be reproduced in an analogous manner in vitro, using cell-based as well as cell-free assays. The evolved PrP Sc like isoforms -termed PrP res -harbor similar biochemical characteristics like resistance to Proteinase K and detection by same antibodies.",

            "text": "Accumulation of PrP Sc in the central nervous system (CNS) is accompanied by neurological dysfunctions, neuronal vacuolation, and astrocytic gliosis. Although the exact disease causing mechanism is unknown to date, there is evidence for a general neurotoxicity of these aggregates, which deteriorate synaptic function and induce oxidative stress and membrane disruption (Soto and Estrada, 2008). Prion diseases belong to the group of protein misfolding diseases like Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), which are generally characterized by an incorrect folding process of a host encoded protein with a conformation different from its native structure. The misfolding is followed by a self-aggregation and polymerization of the protein according to a \"seeding-nucleation\" process (Jarrett and Lansbury, 1993).",

Several substances have been identified which inhibit PrP res formation and accumulation in vitro and prolonged survival in scrapie-infected animals: Congo red (Caughey and Race, 1992), branched polyamines (Supattapone et al., 2001), porphyrins and phthalocyanines (Priola et al., 2000;Caughey et al., 2007), heparan sulfate mimetics (Adjou et al., 2003), amphotericin (Mange et al., 2000), curcumine (Caughey et al., 2003;Yang et al., 2009), and tetracyclines (De Luigi et al., 2008). However, for various reasons none of these compounds has been included in prevention and treatment regimes for humans yet. Most recently two new substance classes, benzothiazoles (Geissen et al., 2011) and diphenylpyrazoles (Leidel et al., 2011), were identified by high-throughput screening approaches that inhibit PrP res accumulation in cell culture models and prolong incubation times in scrapie-infected mice.",

A possible molecular mechanism is based on direct binding to the PrP C and the formation of a stable PrP-baicalein/baicalin complex, which blocks PrP conversion and/or accumulation. In the same way the destabilization of pre-existing fibrils would be caused by a specific intercalation of baicalein/baicalin into \u03b2-sheet structures of the PrP Sc aggregates which may lead to a forced PrP Sc degradation by lysosomal proteases. Similar effects by Baicalein have been described for the inhibition of \u03b1-synuclein (Zhu et al., 2004) and amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) fibrillization (Lu et al., 2011).

Additional antioxidant properties of baicalein on reactive oxygen species (ROS), which evolve during protein aggregation, may reinforce this neuroprotective effect (Li et al., 2010). Baicalein is able to minimize ROS by directly quenching free radicals or indirectly inducing antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and catalase (Shieh et al., 2000;Kang et al., 2011).",

It is in vivo efficacy, however, remains controversial: the oral administration of curcumin had no significant effect on the onset of scrapie in hamsters (Caughey et al., 2003), whereas scrapie-infected mice significantly survived longer after oral treatment (Riemer et al., 2008). Effects of other polyphenols (e.g., tannic acid, katacine, and 2 -2 -bis epigallocatechin gallate) that interfere with PrP conversion in vitro were also studied in vivo (Kocisko et al., 2003). However, neither these substances nor mixtures of natural compounds including polyphenolic tea extract and pine bark extracts displayed any effects on incubation periods in scrapie-infected animals (Kocisko et al., 2004).",
