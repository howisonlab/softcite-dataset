            "text": "Several dwarf plum genotypes (Prunus salicina L.), due to deficiency of unknown gibberellin (GA) signalling, were identified. A cDNA encoding GA 2-oxidase (PslGA2ox), the major gibberellin catabolic enzyme in plants, was cloned and used to screen the GA-deficient hybrids. This resulted in the identification of a dwarf plum hybrid, designated as DGO24, that exhibits a markedly elevated PslGA2ox signal. Grafting 'Early Golden' (EG), a commercial plum cultivar, on DGO24 (EG/D) enhanced PslGA2ox accumulation in the scion part and generated trees of compact stature. Assessment of active GAs in such trees revealed that DGO24 and EG/D accumulated relatively much lower quantities of main bioactive GAs (GA 1 and GA 4) than control trees (EG/M). Moreover, the physiological function of PslGA2ox was studied by determining the molecular and developmental consequences due to ectopic expression in Arabidopsis. Among several lines, two groups of homozygous transgenics that exhibited contrasting phenotypes were identified. Group-1 displayed a dwarf growth pattern typical of mutants with a GA deficiency including smaller leaves, shorter stems, and delay in the development of reproductive events. In contrast, Group-2 exhibited a 'GA overdose' phenotype as all the plants showed elongated growth, a typical response to GA application, even under limited GA conditions, potentially due to co-suppression of closely related Arabidopsis homologous. The studies reveal the possibility of utilizing PslGA2ox as a marker for developing size-controlling rootstocks in Prunus.",

            "text": "Modern fruit growing creates an increasing demand for tree size control that can offer numerous horticultural advantages. Trees with reduced stature allow high density cultivation, facilitate tree management, and minimize spray drift. In most temperate fruits, dwarf rootstocks can have profound effects on scions such as controlling tree size, flowering time, yield efficiency, and fruit quality (Janick et al., 1996). However, the mechanism by which these effects are achieved is still not well understood. Attempts to explain how rootstocks cause dwarfing of trees, which focused on their effects on supply of mineral nutrients and water to the scion, have not provided any convincing explanations (Jones, 1984;Ebel et al., 2000). Other studies, which focused on the production and movement of endogenous hormones, demonstrated that dwarfism could be associated with deficiencies in gibberellin (GA) levels or signalling (Cristoferi and Filiti, 1981;Erez, 1984;Webster, 2004).",

            "text": "In plants, it is important to maintain optimal levels of phytohormones to ensure normal growth and development. Hence, it is essential that there is a mechanism in place to remove any excess active compounds or their biosynthetic precursors to ensure proper function of phytohormones. Such a strategy can modulate the signal produced and subsequently prevent the progressive accumulation of the hormones. A number of inactivation pathways have been identified for GA (Thomas and Hedden, 2006;Zhu et al., 2006). However, based on the prevalence of 2b-hydroxylated GAs in many plant species (MacMillan, 2002), the most widespread mechanism for GA inactivation seems to be via 2-oxidation (Thomas et al., 1999). Genes encoding GA 2-oxidases (GA2oxs) were first identified by screening cDNA expression libraries for 2b-hydroxylase activity (Martin et al., 1999;Thomas et al., 1999). Early characterized GA2oxs are active against C 19 -GAs as substrates, including functional GAs and their immediate precursors. Later, a new type of GA2ox that catabolizes only the non-bioactive C 20 -GAs was reported (Schomburg et al., 2003). Apparently, this class of GA2ox is not involved in inactivation of functional GAs, but may be important in regulating GA biosynthesis through the removal of earlier intermediates in the pathway.",

DGO24, when used as rootstock, reduces the scion ['Early Golden' (EG)] vigour and also causes several developmental defects; however, these could be temporarily restored by exogenous GA application. Moreover, the role of GA during different stages of fruit development was determined by studying the expression profile of PslGA2ox mRNA that reflects the alteration in GA accumulation. A model is proposed in which the role played by the plant hormone GA is as critical as that of auxin to ensure correct fruit development. Further, it was demonstrated that the overexpression of this gene results in a GA-deficient phenotype in Arabidopsis with growth traits similar to those found in EG/D (EG/DGO24) plum trees. In another case, the PslGA2ox transgene caused co-suppression of closely related Arabidopsis homologous, which triggered GA accumulation and resulted in a GA overdose phenotype. The results show that GA2ox can be used as a marker for the selection of dwarf rootstocks that might be suitable for the tender fruit industry.",

Plant materials were homogenized in 15 ml of cold 80% methanol containing 50 ng of deuterated GA 1 and GA 4 , and extracted overnight in darkness at 4\u00b0C. After filtration, the residue was re-extracted with 5 ml of 80% methanol for 2 h and refiltered. The extract was purified through a C18 Sep-pack cartridge and the eluate was absorbed onto 0.5 g of Celite 545 (ProLab), and purified by step-elution silicic acid (SiO 2 ) partition chromatography running into an ethyl acetate:hexane (95:5) buffer. The samples were then evaporated under reduced pressure at room temperature until dry. Phytohormones were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) carried out on a Varian 1200l triple quadrupole, working in positive electrospray ionization mode (ESI+) with a capillary voltage of 5500 V and acid voltage of 40 V.

The levels of phytohormones in the plant samples were determined from the area ratios of endogenous to corresponding deuterated phytohomones. A curve was prepared always with the same quantity of labelled isotope added to samples and with concentrations from 1 ppb to 250 ppb for the compounds analysed.

Sequence analysis of the PCR product indicated that this fragment encoded a part of the GA2ox gene family. Extension of the partial cDNA clone resulted in a full-length cDNA containing an open reading frame of 1482 bp encoding a protein of 342 amino acids and hence designated PslGA2ox. Alignment of the PslGA2ox amino acid sequence with that of other reported GA2oxs revealed that the predicted protein shares sequence identity ranging from 53% to 68% with closely related homologues and highlighted a number of conserved motifs and structural similarities that are common within the dioxygenase family of GA catabolic enzymes (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online) (Valeg\u00e5rd et al., 1998). In order to classify the PslGA2ox sequence among the various GA2oxs, a phylogenetic tree was constructed (Fig. 1). The dendrogram analysis defines that the GA2ox gene family could be divided into three main classes based upon sequence conservation. PslGA2ox is a member of class I that (as well as class II), act as a major C 19 -GA deactivator (Thomas et al., 1999). However, tested members of class III can only catabolize C 20 -GA2oxs (Schomburg et al., 2003). Additionally, analysis of various GA2ox amino acid sequences, characterized so far, revealed the absence of any obvious targeting sequence that can signify the localization of this protein in the plant cell. The results show that the GFP distribution in both control and PslGA2ox-GFP is spread throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Supplementary  Fig. S2 at JXB online).",

            "text": "Twenty-five dwarf individual plum hybrids, produced through controlled hybridizations in a breeding program, were identified phenotypically based on their compact stature with short internodes and small dark leaves. In order to determine if the dwarf phenotype is due to deficiency in bioactive GAs, they were treated with GA 3 . GA application showed phenotypic effects in only 10 hybrids as determined by their internode length and leaf size. To establish if the dwarfism in these hybrids is associated with PslGA2ox, they were screened against a vigorously growing plum, EG/M, for the accumulation of PslGA2ox ( Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online). The expression results defined that only one hybrid, designated DGO24, displayed significantly high PslGA2ox mRNA levels; therefore, this was selected for further analysis. Then, the full-length PslGA2ox cDNA was isolated from DGO24 to determine whether there are divergences within the amino acid sequence that can elucidate the hyper accumulation of transcripts. However, sequence analysis revealed a nucleotide sequence identical to that isolated from EG/M trees. Compared with EG/M control trees (tree height 3.7360.22 m), DGO24 displayed very short trees along with a slow growth rate (tree height 1.3760.15 m). Grafting EG onto DGO24 (EG/D) resulted in shoots that exhibited shorter internodes and reduced stem elongation (tree height 2.0660.25 m) than EG/M ( Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online). To determine whether PslGA2ox accumulation is the cause of the EG scion's phenotype, its expression was studied in EG/M, DGO24, and EG/D shoots. A strong signal was detected in both DGO24 and EG/D trees; however, the expression was weak in EG/M (Fig. 2). It was thus decided to investigate bioactive GA accumulation within the three different plum trees with the aim to determine whether there are dissimilarities in GA content that can account for the diversity in growth behaviour. Quantification of active GAs revealed that DGO24 and EG/D shoots exhibited at least 6-and 8fold lower concentrations of the bioactive forms GA 1 and GA 4 , respectively, than EG/M (Table 1).",

In order to elucidate the physiological role of PslGA2ox and subsequently the contribution of GAs in fruit development, its expression profile was analysed during different stages of EG/M fruits (Fig. 4). PslGA2ox transcripts were initially low in flower buds, but greatly increased soon after flowering [;4 days after bloom (DAB)] followed by sharp inhibition of its mRNA levels after fertilization, ;7 DAB. The accumulation of PslGA2ox mRNA at bloom represented the highest transcript abundance during the whole experiment. During early fruit development, 7-15 DAB, PslGA2ox transcripts increased gradually in young fruits. Stone fruits (Prunus spp.) exhibit a typical double sigmoid growth pattern during fruit development, with four distinct stages, S1-S4 (El-Sharkawy et al., 2007). Within the first stage, intense cell division is predominant, while during  S2 phase there is hardly any increase in fruit size but the endocarp hardens to form a solid stone. Throughout these developmental periods (22-52 DAB), PslGA2ox transcription showed a significant and gradual increase, reaching relatively maximal levels by the end of the S2 stage. The S3 stage (62-72 DAB) is accompanied by a considerable increase in fruit size, which is mostly attributable to cell expansion. In S3 phase, when the pulp readily separates from the seed, PslGA2ox levels increased in abundance within the pulp tissue, but consistently decreased in the seeds during maturity. Throughout the S4 stage, where most metabolic changes due to fruit ripening take place, PslGA2ox accumulation was generally low. As ripening progressed, the expression level of PslGA2ox increased in abundance within the pulp tissue, reaching relatively high levels at the post-climacteric phase (;83 DAB); however, in the seeds, its transcription increased to a peak at the pre-climacteric stage (;80 DAB) and slightly decreased thereafter.",

            "text": "GA2ox proteins play repressive roles in plant growth and development through catabolizing bioactive GAs, in particular GA 4 , into inactive forms (Thomas et al., 1999;Schomburg et al., 2003). The present results suggest the involvement of PslGA2ox in the dwarf plum (DGO24); however, to confirm this hypothesis, the PslGA2ox gene was overexpressed in Arabidopsis, where GA 4 is the major active GA controlling different aspects of plant development (Xu et al., 1999). Ectopic expression of PslGA2ox led to a wide range of disturbances in general growth and development behaviour. Six independent transgenic lines were confirmed after PCR analysis and then divided into two groups based on their phenotypic and molecular characteristics ( Fig. 5). Group-1, including L.1, L.5, and L.7, exhibited a typical dwarf phenotype due to a significant decline in the length of all stem growth-related characters, resulting in ;60% reduction in overall plant height, which was associated with considerably high PslGA2ox levels. Group-2 that includes L.2, L.3, and L.4 showed a hypergrowth pattern. The plants were ;41% taller than the WT due to notably shorter, but numerous internodes, which was associated with low but significant PslGA2ox accumulation ( Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online; Fig. 5A, B). Analysis of the transgene profile in mutant plants showed that the level of PslGA2ox correlated negatively with plant height. The tallest plants had the lowest transcription levels while the expression was weaker in longer plants. Thus a homozygous representative from each group (L.1/G1 and L.4/G2) was selected for further studies. To assess whether the overexpression of PslGA2ox can disturb the GA response pathway, the transcription levels of a number of genes that are induced (At2g21220, AtGA2ox2, AtGA2ox3, and AtGA2ox8) or repressed (AtGA20ox1 and AtGA3ox1) by GA were determined (Phillips et al., 1995;Thomas et al., 1999;Schomburg et al., 2003;Nemhauser et al., 2006). Expression of the various GA-responsive genes was considerably different in the two lines (Fig. 5C). All GA-inducible transcripts were suppressed by 21-57% in L.1/G1, and the GA-repressed genes, AtGA20ox1 and AtGA3ox1, increased by ;4.7and ;5.5-fold, respectively. In contrast to the expected results, L.4/G2 accumulated more of the GAup-regulated transcripts, while AtGA2ox2 and AtGA2ox3 were barely detected. Application of GA 3 that cannot be metabolized by GA2oxs (Sakamoto et al., 2001) resulted in a differential response in the treated plants (Supplementary  Table S2 at JXB online; Fig. S6). GA treatment rescued L.1/G1 height as a result of increasing internode number and length. However in L.4/G2, GA treatment caused a significant plant height reduction (;47%). To evaluate the effect of GA, the expression of the different GAregulated genes was assessed (Fig. 5D). In L.1/G1, the accumulation profile of the different GA-responsive genes was similar to that in the WT, while in L.4/G2, only a modest increase in the various GA-up-regulated transcripts was observed; however, AtGA2ox2 and AtGA2ox3 remained undetectable. Generally, the GA biosynthesis inhibitor (PAC) and SD conditions reduced stem elongation and shoot growth of all treated plants ( Supplementary Fig.  S6 at JXB online). However, this effect was very pronounced in L.1/G1, and half of the plants were dead before completing their life cycle.",

A similar flower structure was observed in Group-2, but this was largely due to acceleration of pistil growth ( Supplementary Table S4 at JXB online; Fig. 7). Such variation between the stamens and pistil can cause a major reduction in fertility, especially in self-pollinated species. GA application visibly changed the flower structure. In Group-1, the flower size, pistil and stamen lengths were mostly restored; however, the stamen remained shorter than the pistil. In contrast, GA reduced overall Group-2 flower size without a visible change in structure. In general, PAC and SD treatments reduced the size of the various floral organs. In the case of Group-1, SD conditions significantly affected pistil elongation, resulting in filaments much longer than the pistils. Although Group-2 pistil length was also reduced due to SD, the flowers were generally larger than SD-grown WT.",

            "text": "Arabidopsis flowers consist of a precise pattern of organs arranged in four concentric whorls. In addition to the regular flowers, all Group-1 members also exhibited fused flowers (Fig. 8A). These abnormal flowers hold eight short stamens with often fasciated filaments (Fig. 8B). In some instances, the stamens were completely malformed beyond recognition (Fig. 8C). Additionally, they also had two separate, functional pistils, as they progressed towards maturity (Fig. 8B, D). Such fused flowers were alternatively arranged in a pre-set pattern along with regular flowers within the whole plant (Fig. 8E). In spite of these defects, both the pollen and pistil seemed to be at least partially viable as pollen germination and occasional seed set could be observed. These results indicate that Group-1 plants exhibited major disorder in the floral organ identity pro-cedure, while GA treatment along with LD conditions was largely enough to recover all defects in plant development including floral organogenesis ( Supplementary Fig. S7A at JXB online). To investigate the cause of floral organogenesis deformities, the expression profile of a set of genes involved in floral patterning, such as LFY and the floral homeotic genes from classes B (AP3 and PI) and C (AG), were studied (Parcy et al., 1998;Lohmann and Weigel, 2002). Relative to the WT, accumulation of all studied transcripts dramatically decreased in L.1/G1 (Supplementary Fig. S7B at JXB online). Thus, it was decided to examine further the potential involvement of GA in the promotion of floral-related gene expression. Interestingly, GA treatment restored the regular flower patterning as well as the levels of all studied genes ( Supplementary Fig. S7A, B at JXB online). Growing Group-1 mutants under SD increased the disturbance in the floral organs (Fig. 9). The whole plant exhibited flowers with reduced number of stamens that were not consistent either in thickness or in length. Some flowers displayed fasciations of stamens at filaments and/or anthers (Fig. 9A). In other flowers, the stamens fused to other floral organs such as petals or carpel, and the anthers were malformed (Fig. 9B, C). In yet other cases, the filament was totally absent, resulting in anthers fused directly to the base (Fig. 9D). The stamens also show other deformities such as rudimentary anthers on unusual thick filamentous structure (Fig. 9E), such that the filament and the anther could not properly differentiate. Similarly, an abnormal short and thick stigma was also observed. In such cases, the ovary is often split, exposing the ovules (Fig.  9E). Consequently, such disruptions in the flower organogenesis caused complete sterility. The results showed that all these major disorders were associated with low or almost undetectable floral patterning transcripts. Interestingly, treatment of Group-1 plants under SD conditions with GA recovered the different aspects of the plant growth pattern to near normal ( Supplementary Fig. S7C, D at JXB online).",

Then, a cDNA sequence encoding GA 2-oxidase (PslGA2ox), the major GA catabolic enzyme in plants, was used to screen the 10 hybrids. This resulted in the identification of a plum hybrid (DGO24) that showed extremely high PslGA2ox accumulation, concomitant with low accumulation of bioactive GA 1 and GA 4 . The irregular growth pattern of DGO24, including the compact stature and deformed flowers, is transmissible to the scion in grafted trees, to a certain extent. Thus, it is possible to interpret this to mean that DGO24 rootstock may be involved in the inactivation of bioactive GAs within the scion part, which is further supported by the low amount of active GAs in EG/D compared with control trees.",

EG/D trees exhibited a significant delay in fruit development. The reestablishment of fruit development is dependent on the availability of sufficient GA in the appropriate developmental stages, when the requirements for GAs are essential. Dunberg and Od\u00e9n (1983) showed that the active GA 4 is the most effective GA form leading to flowering promotion and reproductive growth. Thus, the scarcity of overall active GA content, particularly GA 4 , within EG/D trees can explain the distortion in flower structure and the delay in flowering events as well as the shift of the overall fruit ripening date. Consequently, determining the role of GA during fruit ontogeny has convenient implications in understanding and controlling the fruit development process.",

Analysis of the PslGA2ox expression profile indicated that GAs play important roles in fruit development, mainly throughout immature stages before ripening. In flowers, the abundance of PslGA2ox transcripts suggested a dominant task of GA in promoting flowering and elucidated the role of PslGA2ox enzyme in regulating GA accumulation during this stage (Dunberg and Od\u00e9n, 1983;Pharis and King, 1985).",

Additionally, in Prunus spp., the evolution of the plant hormones auxin and GA was found to exhibit a similar pattern during fruit development (Yamaguchi andTakahashi, 1976, Miller et al., 1987). Furthermore, earlier studies in Prunus showed the stimulatory effect of exogenous auxin and GA on enhancing fruit development (Jackson, 1968;El-Sharkawy et al., 2010; this study). Taken together, apparently during plum fruit growth, in particular during S1, S3, and S4 phases, the actions of auxin and GA are not independent of each other but are coordinated to regulate the progression of fruit development, as has been proposed previously in other plant systems (Serrani et al., 2007;Csukasi et al., 2011). Recent studies reported that the growth of seeded tomato fruits is coordinated by a delicate balance between auxin and GA (de Jong et al., 2009), where auxin is needed to mediate the rate of cell division, and GA is required to organize cell expansion. The mutual effect of the two phytohormones was further validated in the development of parthenocarpic fruit. Either auxin or GA treatment can promote parthenocarpic tomato fruit growth, whereas neither of them alone was able to maintain the growth rate to the end of ripening. Only the joint application of both hormones resulted in parthenocarpic fruits similar to those obtained by pollination (Serrani et al., 2007). This is accurate for the different developmental stages, excluding the S2 phase. As mentioned previously, during the S2 stage there is hardly any increase in fruit size (no evidence of cell division and the expansion process), which coincided with a significant reduction in auxin content (Miller et al., 1987). Therefore, the accumulation of GAs during the S2 stage seems to be due to the lignification of the endocarp to form a solid stone, which is the only developmental process occurring during this stage. Biemelt et al. (2004) demonstrated that GA mediates lignin formation and deposition by polymerization of pre-formed monomers.",

Interestingly, both Group-1 mutants and EG/D trees displayed many common GAdeficient growth traits, including compact vegetative growth and general disturbance in reproductive development events, which is indicative of the role of PslGA2ox in producing this phenotype. The previous growth properties along with the accelerated root formation are a common behaviour in GAdeficient mutants (Koornneef and van der Veen, 1980;Griffiths et al., 2006;Rieu et al., 2008b;Gou et al., 2010). Although the disturbances in the flowering characteristics were the most pronounced outcome in Group-1 mutants, it still can produce flowers. Previous reports indicated that the development of floral organs is usually interrupted in GAdeficient plants (Goto and Pharis, 1999;Cheng et al., 2004) or in plants incapable of responding to GA (Griffiths et al., 2006), which triggers flower infertility. However, most of these mutants remained leaky to some degree, and can produce small amounts of active GAs, sufficient to induce flowering even under severe GA growth conditions such as SDs (Wilson et al., 1992). In Arabidopsis, development of floral organs is under the control of homeotic genes that must be accessible to maintain the typical organogenesis process (Weigel and Meyerowitz, 1994). In Group-1 flowers under LDs or SDs, transcripts of the different floral organ identity genes were significantly lower, which can explain the abnormal flower formation. However, the plant phenotype along with the expression profile of homeotic genes before and after GA treatment suggests its essentiality to maintain their accumulation and subsequently have a correct flower patterning (Lohmann and Weigel, 2002;Eriksson et al., 2006;this study). Arabidopsis is a facultative LD plant and its flowering is controlled by the interplay between three different pathways: LDs, an autonomous pathway, and the GA pathway. However, only the GA pathway plays a central role in the control of flower initiation under SDs (Mouradov et al., 2002;Boss et al., 2004;Putterill et al., 2004). Apparently growing Group-1 members under LDs alone can relatively minimize, but not prevent, the disturbance in the floral organogenesis procedure (Weigel et al., 1992). However, the disorders under SDs were more severe, and this is largely due to the critical LFY levels that are the target of photoperiodic regulation (Bl\u00e1zquez et al., 1997) and GA (Eriksson et al., 2006). Consequently, GA treatment resulted in proper reestablishment of most Group-1 growth deformities under both LDs and SDs, including vegetative growth and floral organogenesis through restoring the accumulation profile of the various GA-regulated transcripts especially those of floral organ identity mRNAs.",

            "text": "In contrast, in Group-2 plants, PslGA2ox insertion somehow caused co-suppression of the closely related Arabidopsis homologous AtGA2ox2 and AtGA2ox3 that probably lead to an overall increase in active GAs (Rieu et al., 2008a). Consequently, the different GA-related transcripts accumulated in a manner resembling unlimited GA conditions. Further, at the phenotypical level, Group-2 mutants demonstrated a characteristic 'GA overdose' growth pattern (Sun, 2000). Fleet and Sun (2005) reported that plants exhibiting a GA overdose phenotype showed excessive growth and increased sterility, suggesting the importance of optimal GA levels to ensure proper growth and development. The overall growth pattern of Group-2 plants resembled that of ga2ox quintuple mutant (Rieu et al., 2008a) or those of GA-treated WT plants. The present results showed that any additional GA caused contradictory responses in Group-2, probably due to reaching lethal levels of the hormone. Synchronized elongation of the pistil and filament is essential to ensure efficient pollination within the flower. High levels of GA can induce male sterility and cause excessive elongation of the pistil (Sawhney and Shukla, 1994;Colombo and Favret, 1996). Plants carrying mutations in the biosynthetic (GA20oxs) or catabolic genes (C 19 -GA2oxs) exhibited extended pistils, resulting in partial infertility (Rieu et al., 2008a, b). A loss of fertility has also been described for WT plants treated with GA (Jacobsen and Olszewski, 1993) and for double mutants in the GA signalling repressors, RGA and GAI (Dill and Sun, 2001). Here, it is shown that Group-2 plants behaved similarly, which appears to be due to increased length of the pistil relative to the stamen that consequently reduces the self-pollination efficiency. Apparently, many GA-dependent mechanisms might be quite saturated within this group. Any additional GA results in serious disruptions of growth and development. The inhibitory effect of GA was clearly demonstrated by treating L.4/G2 with gradually increasing GA concentrations, which caused a significant reduction in silique length using 10-fold lower GA concentrations compared with the WT. The growth pattern of Group-2 plants under GA-deprived conditions further confirms the GA overdose phenotype. Rieu et al. (2008a) observed that PAC-treated ga2ox quintuple mutant exhibited a general growth spurt in comparison with treated WT. Further, PAC-treated and SD-grown L.4 plants exhibited earlier flowering onset, earlier silique maturation, and larger siliques than the WT exposed to the same conditions.",
