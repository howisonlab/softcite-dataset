Based on an integrated analysis, we found that brain-specific proteins are 1.8 times more likely to be observed in CSF than in plasma, that brain-specific proteins tend to decrease in HD CSF compared with unaffected CSF, and that 81% of brainspecific proteins have quantitative changes concordant with transcriptional changes identified in different regions of HD brain. The proteins found to increase in HD CSF tend to be liver-associated. These protein changes are consistent with neurodegeneration, microgliosis, and astrocytosis known to occur in HD. We also discuss concordance between laboratories and find that ratios of individual proteins can vary greatly, but the overall trends with respect to brain or liver specificity were consistent. Concordance is highest between the two laboratories observing the largest numbers of proteins. Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 8: 451-466, 2009.

The cause of the disease is the expansion of trinucleotide (CAG) repeats in the coding region of the htt gene that translates into a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein (1).

To speed assessment of therapies in clinical trials, it is critical to identify biological markers that can accurately monitor disease progression.",

            "text": "Several genomics and proteomics approaches to identifying biomarkers for HD have been undertaken previously. Genomics studies have determined the molecular phenotype of human HD brain (2) and different tissues of HD mouse models at the mRNA level (3)(4)(5)(6). Proteomics approaches have been applied to brain tissues of HD mouse models and humans to identify candidate markers (7)(8)(9). Blood plasma in particular has received considerable attention recently because of its ready accessibility clinically (10,11). The candidate protein biomarkers identified in the blood proteomics studies are largely known inflammatory markers. Because HD is regarded primarily as a neurodegenerative disease, it is not entirely clear how directly general markers of neuroinflammation relate to the pathophysiology of HD, although astrocytosis and microgliosis (12) are prominent components of HD in its mid-to late stages (13). Another concern regarding markers discovered primarily in blood is that the blood-brain barrier may restrict brain proteins from entering plasma, and so plasma candidates may not directly reflect HD progression in the brain.",

CSF is an ultrafiltrate of arterial blood produced by the choroid plexus in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. However, it has been estimated that about 20% of the proteins in CSF are derived from brain (21), making CSF an attractive source of potential disease biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (16,22,23).

However, the laboratories are consistent with respect to the overall trends that brain-specific proteins decline and liver-specific proteins increase in HD samples. Concordance in protein ratios and overall trends is greatest between the two labora-tories identifying the highest number of proteins. This supports an argument that future studies with resource limitations should emphasize the depth of protein coverage and include multiple laboratories only if their experimental methods complement each other in terms of the protein observations (30).

On the day of the lumbar puncture, all subjects had a comprehensive clinical evaluation including assessment on the complete United Huntington Disease Rating Scale. Based on the United Huntington Disease Rating Scale independence score as defined by the Huntington Study Group (31), 10 of the 20 gene-positive individuals were categorized as early stage (independence score \u03fe80), and the other 10 were categorized as moderate stage (65 \u03fd independence score \u0545 80). About 5-7 ml of CSF samples were collected in four or five standard lumbar puncture kit tubes (Cardinal-Health, safe-t-LP kit) (catalog number 4301CSDF). Each collected sample was placed on ice and then centrifuged at 2000 \u03eb g (4000 rpm) for 10 min to eliminate cells and other insoluble material. The collected CSF was examined by microscopy, aliquoted, and frozen immediately on dry ice in polypropylene tubes in 1-or 3-ml aliquots and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C. Tubes were filled to the top to minimize oxidation during storage. Average total processing time was 76 min from the start of collection to final storage. No anticoagulants, preservatives, and protease inhibitors were added. The lumbar punctures were atraumatic with CSF cell counts revealing red blood cells from 0 to 171 counts/l and white blood cells from 0 to 17 counts/l, indicating no significant blood cell contamination (supplemental Table  S1). Samples were stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C for various lengths of time ranging from 17 to 27 months before they were thawed and subdivided into aliquots of 0.5 ml to be shipped using dry ice to individual labs for analysis. The duration of shipment was between 1 and 3 days, and dry ice was replenished during the shipment to keep samples frozen. All 30 samples were stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C before thawing once again for analysis. Therefore, except one (HDU-2) that was thawed three times, all samples were thawed twice before analysis.",

On the other hand, if only one quantitation method was used, results from that method were selected. 2) When multiple spots have the same protein identification, -fold changes were averaged for that protein. 3) When a spot resulted in several protein identifications, the same -fold changes were assigned to all proteins.",

The MS duty cycle was set at 1,1,4 as described in detail in the supplemental text, Part A. These data were converted to mzXML files using MassWolf 1.02 with the Waters Datafile Access Component (DAC) library. Following the database search using the common criteria, quantitation was performed using a spectral count approach (35), which sums the number of total spectra assigned to the protein group in that sample. Only peptide spectra with PeptideProphet probability greater than 0.75 or an error rate of 5% were counted for each IPI entry identified. Because individual level variation can be determined for this design, we used a straightforward procedure that tracks all proteins that are members of a single ProteinProphet group within the experiment to associate groups across multiple experiments and to flag groups that are not directly comparable (supplemental text, Part B). After summing up to master protein groups across samples, the average spectral count of all IPI entries within a \"master group\" was assigned to that group. For each master group, total spectral counts from 10 HD-mid samples, 10 HD-early samples, and 10 control samples were summed up and used to calculate HD-mid/control, HD-early/control, and HD-mid/HD-early ratios. Intensity-dependent ratio plots (MA Lab 3-Data from Lab 3 were acquired from the LTQ-FT instrument (Thermo Finnigan). Peak lists were generated by Xcalibur (version 1.1) and converted to mzXML files using ReAdW 1.1 with XRawfile library. Default parameters were used. Database search was carried out using the common parameters and the designated specific modifications (supplemental text, Part B). Protein groups with probability score \u03fe0.9 (corresponding to an overall error rate of 0.01) were considered confident proteins for downstream analysis. The Q3 algorithm (27), developed to accommodate a 3-dalton mass shift in heavy and light peptides, was used to compute the ratios between the light and heavy isotopic pairs using peak areas. More specifically, only confidently identified peptides (PeptideProphet probability \u03fe0.75 and mass error \u03fd20 ppm) were selected for further quantitation at the protein level. In three pairwise comparisons, the internal standard (IS) containing equal amounts of 30 samples was labeled with light acetyl group, and each of the three disease statuses (A, B, or C) was labeled with heavy acetyl group (for details, see supplemental text, Part A). Preliminary analysis found that light/heavy ratios were skewed for both IS versus HD-early and IS versus HD-mid experiments. Because the same amount of protein was loaded into the MS instrument and, in theory, most proteins in the disease and control should remain unchanged, we normalized these ratios. Normalization at the peptide level was performed by median centering the log ratios. Experiments were then aligned to infer the protein changes of different disease status comparisons. Protein inference was performed using the ProteinProphet analysis tool at the lab level, and light/heavy ratios of these protein groups were inferred from ratios at the experiment level by comparing IPI numbers. HD-mid versus control, HD-early versus control, and HD-mid versus HD-early ratios for each protein group were calculated using IS/control, IS/HDmid, and IS/HD-early ratios from the three experiments.",

Protein groups with probability score \u03fe0.9 (corresponding to an overall error rate of 0.01) were considered confident proteins for downstream analysis. For the labeled analysis, as with Lab 3, the Q3 algorithm (27) was used to compute ratios between light and heavy isotopic pairs. And similarly to the methods used for Lab 3, peptides with Peptide-Prophet scores greater than 0.75 and a mass error of less than 20 ppm were selected for the protein level quantitation. Histograms of light/heavy ratios based on the number of cysteines in the peptides revealed that peptides with one cysteine have better normal distributions than peptides with more than one cysteine. Because 80% of peptides contain only one cysteine, only peptides with one cysteine were selected for protein level analysis. To ensure a high confidence of quantitation at the protein level, only those proteins with at least three quantitated peptides were used for further analysis. For the label-free analysis, accurate mass and time (AMT) methods were used to identify peptides in LC-MS data using a single AMT database containing all high quality (PeptideProphet probability \u05460.95) peptide identifications from all labeled (fractionated) and unlabeled (unfractionated) data from Lab 4. The LC-MS peptide features from each unlabeled sample were matched against the combined AMT database to provide peptide assignments. Each match was assigned a probability value based on mass error and normalized retention time error between the MS1 feature and the AMT peptide entry, and only matches with probability \u05460.95 or a false assignment rate \u05450.05 were kept. LC-MS peptide intensity values for the peptides were normalized across runs, and peptide ratios were calculated. The AMT database and matching were performed using the msInspect/AMT software platform (36,37). Protein inference was performed using ProteinProphet, and protein ratios were calculated as well. As with the Lab 3 analysis, experiments were aligned using the ProteinProphet analysis tool at the lab level to infer the protein changes of different disease status comparisons for the labeled and unlabeled methods.

We first transformed the ratios to logarithm scale so that all the data were in a similar range, and then we standardized the scores by centering and scaling log ratios in each lab to have mean 0 and variance 1. The resulting z-score represents the number of standard deviations above or below the mean ratios within each lab. To combine z-scores, we chose to sum them across laboratories. Although one might have considered averaging the z-scores because not all proteins are quantified in the same number of experiments, we chose to sum them so that a protein quantified by only one laboratory must have a higher ratio to achieve the same rank as proteins observed across all laboratories with consistent and modest changes. For the purpose of finding proteins that classify HD, we combined the two HD groups and summed together the sum of z-scores of HD-mid/control and HD-early/ control (sums of z-scores).

The normal human tissue expression data set was acquired from published data provided by Ge et al. (29) that includes a total of 36 types of normal human tissue, covering the complexity of human tissues. Because all CSF samples are from adult human, the annotation will focus on the adult tissue expression pattern. Therefore, data from three fetal tissues were removed. Ge et al. (29) examined a \"whole brain\" and six subregions of the brain (amygdala, corpus callosum, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, hippocampus, and thalamus). However, the cortex region that is noted to have severe cell loss in Huntington disease patients was not included. We removed the \"whole-brain\" data because it is not obvious to us how this RNA sample was prepared. We added the cortex signals and substituted cerebellum and caudate nucleus data with data derived from an extensive study that was carried out on four parts of human normal brain (caudate nucleus, cerebellum, and BA4 and BA9 cortex) using the same microarray chips (2). After these brain data were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets, signals detected using Affymetrix microarray suite version 5 software (MAS5) for each probe were averaged over 21 caudate nucleus, 21 cerebellum, and 24 cortex (12 BA4 and 12 BA9) arrays. We plotted log 2 MAS5 signal of the caudate nucleus and cerebellum from Ge et al. (29) versus those from Hodges et al. (2) and found that the correlations are both 0.90 (supplemental Fig. S1). These high correlations suggest that data from the two studies may be combined. So far, we have data for seven subregions of the brain. Because we want to annotate a gene as being active in the brain if it is active in any part of the brain, we summarized the brain expression data by taking the maximum across all seven subregions. As a result, transcriptional data of \"brain tissues\" and 26 other types of human tissues were included in our analysis. These tissues are from brain, heart, thymus, spleen, ovary, kidney, muscle, pancreas, prostate, intestine, colon, placenta, bladder, breast, uterus, thyroid, skin, salivary, trachea, adrenal, bone marrow, pituitary, spinal cord, testis, liver, stomach, and lung (supplemental Table S5). Finally many genes have multiple probes; one can choose to use the average signal or the maximum signal for each gene. In our analysis, the one with maximum signal among all tissues was selected because we considered that the maximum signal is the highest above the noise level. As a result, we observed 1941 tissue markers based on human array data (supplemental Table S6). The definition of tissue-specific genes/proteins may vary with tissues included in the study and when the thresholds change.",

For instance, muscle-specific genes include myosin, actinin, troponin, creatine kinase, and calcium channels. And testis-specific genes are associated with terms such as spermatogenic, spermspecific, or male-enhanced antigen. In addition, normal mouse gene expression data from Zapala et al. (39) covering 20 subregions of the brain plus 14 tissues from other parts of the adult mouse was used to confirm the human array-based analysis. Similar to human tissue data processing, we combined data from 20 subregions of the brain including striatum, cortex, cerebellum, etc. into one data set called \"brain\" to simplify the analysis using the maximum MAS5 signal of the 20 brain subregions computed for each probe set. As a result, 15 mouse tissues were considered for further analysis: adrenal, pituitary, testis, thymus, spinal cord, choroid plexus, retina, brown adipose tissue, white adipose tissue, kidney, liver, heart, muscle, spleen, and brain (supplemental Table S7). Corresponding human orthologous genes were inferred by human-mouse ortholog data provided by the Human Gene Organisation Gene Nomenclature Committee.

Furthermore by definition, the most powerful and useful biomarkers are intimately related to the etiology of a disease. This raises the question of the precise source of the proteins detected in CSF and whether they can be traced to brain and substructures within the brain or they arise from other sources. Formally one cannot definitively identify the source of each particular CSF protein. Direct evidence must come from some type of tracer experiment. But we can begin to make a circumstantial argument that a substantial fraction of our identified CSF proteins are based upon mRNA expression patterns."

Based on the algorithm described under \"Experimental Procedures,\" 1941 tissue-specific proteins are identified: 445 are brain-and 225 are liver-specific (supplemental Table S6). Integration with the CSF proteomics data found that 298 proteins/genes of 1574 are tissue markers, among which two major species are brain-specific (\u03f330%) and liver-specific (\u03f333%) ( Table IV). One intriguing question is how representative these proteins are compared with plasma. Starting from a list of 3020 proteins identified with two or more peptides provided by the Human Proteome Organization Plasma Proteome Project, we aligned the 1941 tissue markers and found that of 414 proteins that are annotated as tissue-specific proteins 17% are brain-and 53% are liver-specific (Table IV)   2 test to evaluate the significance of differences of representativeness of brain (liver) proteins in CSF and plasma. Numbers of brain (88) versus non-brain (210) marker genes in CSF were tested against those numbers in plasma (71 versus 340). Likewise for liver proteins, numbers of liver (97) versus non-liver (201) proteins in CSF were tested against those numbers in plasma (113 versus 301). compared with plasma (Table IV). This observation can also be confirmed by performing the same analysis using the normal mouse gene expression data from Zapala et al.

We can see that this trend of changes is rather consistent among laboratories for the 40 most altered proteins, especially for those increasing proteins that are more abundant and quantified by more laboratories (Table VI). Concordance was strongest among laboratories identifying the largest number of proteins.",

In the case of Huntington disease this is not yet possible because the exact sequence of pathological events downstream from expression of mutant huntingtin protein remains elusive. However, the predominant view is that the most clinically important signs and symptoms of HD relate to neurodegeneration and dysfunction in the brain. The hallmark neuropathology of HD is degeneration of medium spiny neurons in the striatum accompanied by extensive astrocytosis (47) and microgliosis (12). Gene expression profiling of postmortem human HD brain has been performed using striatal tissue as well as cerebellum and two cortical areas (2, 6). The known pathology and gene expression changes provide a perspective from which to view the proteomic changes.",

Although the assumptions and methods used were somewhat crude and only constitute circumstantial evidence for the source tissue, this created a very biologically plausible list of \"tissue markers.\" Integrating the expression data tissue markers with the CSF proteomics results revealed that many of the most abundant CSF proteins  were probably derived from the liver. This is consistent with the known origin of CSF, which is a complex filtrate of blood produced by the choroid plexus. Importantly many proteins likely to have been derived from the brain were also detected in CSF. This was not seen in a re-examination of a protein component list for blood plasma. In plasma, liver-specific proteins are also highly over-represented, whereas very few brain-specific proteins are detected. The over-representation of brain-specific proteins in CSF supports the hypothesis that it is feasible to monitor some aspects of the health of the brain using CSF. This has important implications for biomarker discovery in neurological disease. However, proving that these proteins are derived from brain tissue is difficult and requires some type of labeling experiment."

However, to the extent that the candidate brain-specific proteins can be traced to a particular region of the brain, most appear to be cerebellum-and cortex-specific rather than specific to the striatum. This may be because the greater mass and surface area of the cortex and cerebellum provide more exposure to the CSF."

The latter may relate to astrocytosis, microgliosis, and neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation is a common component of many neurodegenerative diseases, and these changes are unlikely to be specific to Huntington disease. Thus, although we did not detect a large number of protein changes that can be directly linked to striatal degeneration in HD, we did detect a general trend for brain-related proteins to decrease in HD CSF, and we detected increases in proteins that may reflect neuroinflammatory processes. Both trends are consistent with the known neuropathology of HD and bolster the biological relevance of our findings."

Disruption of the blood-brain barrier is widely accepted in inflammatory conditions such as neurosystemic lupus erythematosus (48,49) and multiple sclerosis (50,51) and increasingly in conditions traditionally seen as degenerative with secondary neuroinflammation, like Alzheimer disease (52). Interestingly microglial activation and the presence of inflammatory cytokines could alter the properties of brain microvascular endothelial cells and the tight junctions that link them (53,54), raising the possibility that the blood-brain barrier is also disturbed in Huntington disease patients. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed differences of brain-and blood-derived proteins in HD CSF. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier in HD can be examined by detecting changes of brain proteins in HD versus normal plasma or more directly using magnetic resonance imaging.",
