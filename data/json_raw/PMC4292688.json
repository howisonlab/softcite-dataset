One may observe a positive attitude related to this element, as all the terms linked to it have this character. Another point of discussion is centered on the fact that the other doctrinal principles which appear in the analysis are associated with it. Emphasis deserves to be given to the connection established between comprehensive care and hierarchization, as these establish the theoretical and practical association of these two principles in the health professionals' symbolic constructions, this being confirmed by the schematic distribution on the similitude tree, associated with the rates of connectivity. The lexicon attendance associated with attends everybody has the highest number of connections among the terms evoked. In this regard, the various facets taken on by attendance stand out, which in this structure expresses a positive attitude, linked to elements such as good attendance, health, unified health system, professional work, attendance to the poor, and difficulty. These connections reflect that, in spite of there existing difficulties in the attendance process, the professionals have a positive attitude related to the same, in addition to re-affirming the characterization of the attendance as the identity of the SUS. It stands out that the principles of the SUS were presented as integrated into the maximum tree, and the negative elements -disorganization and doesn't work -were shown as accessory elements to this structure, permeated by attendance to the poor, through a weak link characterized by the lowest rate of similitude, among all the others.

Another fact which corroborates this assertion is the fact that lexicons exist relating to the principles in all the quadrants of the representational structure, which strengthens the proposal of representational change, in which new elements are incorporated into the periphery and the contrast zone, and later introduced into the central nucleus of the representation, transforming it. The similitude tree shown in Figure 3 refers to the maximum tree of higher education, in which 56 subjects participated, and backs up the previous analysis. -Am. Enfermagem 2014 Jan.-Feb.;22(1):59-67. It was the evocation duty of the State that most established connections with the others, followed by attends everybody and fairness, already supposedly central. This data suggests that the professionals with higher education have a different social representation from the general group, as the term attendance is found on the edge of the tree, while duty of the State and attends everybody are central. It must be considered that the SUS was a system created based on the principle of the universality of care, in which health is taken as a right of all, and a duty of the State (13) . It should be pointed out that all the lexicons which establish connections with duty of the State have positive meanings. The elements hierarchization, integration and organization, associated with duty of the State, indicate an administrative and organizational dimension for which the State is responsible to provide the conditions necessary for the system to function in an integrated and hierarchized way, based on the three levels of complexity, thus ensuring the political and administrative organization of the health system, and its full functioning.As a similarity within the general analysis, we can cite the integration of the principles of the SUS with the tree and the presence of the negative elements of each representation as accessories to this structure, these being: disorganization, doesn't work, inattention and bad. These elements are permeated by attendance to the poor, as this establishes the connection between the negative elements and the rest of the tree, forming a scheme of thought."

At the same time, these terms are associated with attendance to the poor which emphasizes the negativity of this element in the health professionals' representations. Discussion Based on the analysis presented in the Verg\u00e8s matrix, one may observe the presence of a movement of displacement of meanings occurring, in the direction of the periphery and from the elements of contrast to the Central Nucleus, with the incorporation of some principles of the SUS and of positive elements to a representation whose central nucleus does not cover any technical-normative dimension, but only functional and negative elements (4,15) . The lexicons indicative of such principles -attends everybody, duty of the State, comprehensive care and hierarchization -are located on the periphery of the representation and in its contrast zone. As a result, one may infer that there is a more recent incorporation of these principles into the symbolic universe of the group of professionals, an incorporation which is ongoing. On the other hand, the presence of such words in different quadrants of the representational structure points to their displacement, as proposed above. This displacement and its direction (periphery -center) is indicative of an ongoing process of representational change (4,9,15) . The functional and negative elements referred to, in their turn, are expressed particularly in the words attendance and doesn't work, as the most important lexicons of the nucleus. The first term characterizes the purpose of the health system and seems to define its identity, as it incorporates into the representation of the SUS its essential function of the assistance offered to the population. In its turn, the second word adds to the first, strengthening its negative dimension. By contrast with the meanings expressed by the central elements mentioned, only in the analysis of similitude can one observe the centrality of the principle of universality (attends everybody) and of the responsibilization of the State (duty of the State), through the large number of connections with other elements and through the high rates of similitude which"

This set of meanings encompassing the SUS is present in the representation analyzed, as the health professionals constructed a web of knowledge and perceptions, in which the connections established may not always be observed in a single analysis, as shown in the present text.Conclusion Based on the results observed in this study, it may be concluded that the health professionals had incorporated into their symbolic constructions -even if partially -the principles which govern the Brazilian health system. It should be emphasized that it was possible to identify the different contents constituting the social representation of the SUS among the health professionals, as well as to identify the specific elements in the comparison between the professionals with distinct levels of education. Based on this comparison, different representations were identified, confirmed by the relations of connectedness established between the central system and the periphery of the representation analyzed through the technique of similitude. In analyzing the structure of the social representation of the professionals with higher education, the expressions which reflect on the principles of universality and fairness of the health actions are present in the probable central nucleus, in addition to other positive elements. This finding allows the inference that this is the subgroup of professionals responsible for the incorporation of the principles of the SUS into the representation of the general group, as well as for the positive attitude towards the health system. Another characteristic present in this subgroup's representation, and which corroborates this assertion, is the fact that lexicons exist related to the ethical and doctrinal principals of the SUS in all the quadrants of the representational structure. As discussed and demonstrated in the results relating to the mobility of the elements in the representational structure, it may be asserted that there is an ongoing process of representational change with the insertion into the representational structure of new contents which are indicative of principles and positive elements related to the SUS. One can observe, in the analysis of the quadrants, a representation anchored in the assistential role of the State, associated with the image of disorganization and non-functionality of the public services, focussed on attendance and with negative meanings. In the complementary analyses of similitude one may observe a representation transforming, through a converging movement, into a symbolic construction with positive meanings, and anchored in the ethical-doctrinal principles of the SUS. This proposal was further strengthened by the presence of positive elements and principles in the peripheral system of the representation and in the contrast zone, as previously discussed."
