            "text": "Much has been learned about the voltage sensors of ion channels since the x-ray structure of the mammalian voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2 was published in 2005. High resolution structural data of a Kv channel enabled the structural interpretation of numerous electrophysiological findings collected in various ion channels, most notably Shaker, and permitted the development of meticulous computational simulations of the activation mechanism. The fundamental premise for the structural interpretation of functional measurements from Shaker is that this channel and Kv1.2 have the same characteristics, such that correlation of data from both channels would be a trivial task. We tested these assumptions by measuring Kv1.2 voltage-dependent gating and charge per channel. We found that the Kv1.2 gating charge is near 10 elementary charges (e o), \ue07a25% less than the well-established 13-14 e o in Shaker. Next, we neutralized positive residues in the Kv1.2 S4 transmembrane segment to investigate the cause of the reduction of the gating charge and found that, whereas replacing R1 with glutamine decreased voltage sensitivity to \ue07a50% of the wild-type channel value, mutation of the subsequent arginines had a much smaller effect. These data are in marked contrast to the effects of charge neutralization in Shaker, where removal of the first four basic residues reduces the gating charge by roughly the same amount. In light of these differences, we propose that the voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of Kv1.2 and Shaker might undergo the same physical movement, but the septum that separates the aqueous crevices in the VSD of Kv1.2 might be thicker than Shaker's, accounting for the smaller Kv1.2 gating charge.",

Several paradigmatic gating models have been fine-tuned using Shaker-derived data (Zagotta et al., 1994a;Ledwell and Aldrich, 1999), and the bestconstrained models of gating have been developed to account for Shaker channel behavior (Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998b). Mutagenesis has provided a wealth of structural-functional information, and the mechanism of voltage sensing in voltage-dependent channels has been revealed mostly by studies performed in Shaker (Sigworth, 1994;Yellen, 2002;Swartz, 2008).",

            "text": "The current consensus regarding the functioning of the voltage sensor in Shaker is that the transmembrane domains S1-S4 function as a portable voltage-sensing module (Alabi et al., 2007). Six positively charged residues in the S4 segment interact with the membrane electric field and move outward in response to positive voltages (Mannuzzu et al., 1996;Cha and Bezanilla, 1997). Although the magnitude of this movement is somewhat controversial, it is well established that the Abbreviations used in this paper: MD, molecular dynamics; VSD, voltagesensing domain. total gating charge is 12-14 elementary charges (e o ) (Schoppa et al., 1992;Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996;Noceti et al., 1996;Islas and Sigworth, 1999). The first charged residue, R1, appears to contribute \ue07a28% of the gating charge, and R2, R3, R4, and K5 contribute 35, 26, 28, and 15%, respectively  (Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996;Seoh et al., 1996). That is, the first four positive residues contribute about the same amount of charge. The large magnitude of charge movement has been explained by the existence of aqueous cavities that sharply focus the electric field near the center of the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) (Islas and Sigworth, 2001;Asamoah et al., 2003 ;Ahern and Horn, 2005) and across which the S4 charges move in sequence (Tao et al., 2010).",

The structural model of Shaker was constructed using the I-TASER protein structure prediction server, with the All of our patch-clamp recordings of ionic and gating currents were performed in the cell-attached configuration to maximize patch stability and avoid voltage shifts that have been reported to be present in Kv1.2 channels when recorded in excised-patch configurations (Rezazadeh et al., 2007;Schmidt et al., 2012). Nevertheless, we observed some variability in channel behavior. Most currents behaved as those ionic potassium (K + ) currents depicted in Fig. 1 A. Large amplitude currents could be routinely measured, with activation that speeded up with depolarizing voltages, as has been reported for other voltage-gated K + ion channels and previously for Kv1.2 (Scholle et al., 2004). Occasionally, faster onset currents could be recorded, which also activated over a more negative voltage range (not depicted). These less common currents are related to the more typical ones shown in Fig. 1 by an approximate \ue03215-mV voltage shift, both in kinetics and steady-state properties. This observation is similar to what has been shown to occur to Kv1.2 in mammalian cell expression systems (Rezazadeh et al., 2007) and to the Kv1.2-Kv2.1 paddle chimera (Schmidt et al., 2012), where fast and slow populations of channels can be distinguished. In our recording conditions (symmetric K + ), the I-V curve shows a negative slope region, indicative of voltage-dependent activation (Fig. 1 B). The voltage dependence of activation was estimated from the amplitude of tail currents at the end of a depolarizing pulse. The normalized magnitude of the tail current is shown in Fig. 1 C, along with a fit to a fourth-power Boltzmann function, with an apparent gating charge per subunit of 2.7 e o .",

On-gating currents were integrated to obtain the charge moved at every voltage. Estimation of the apparent gating charge was done through the limiting slope method as implemented in Islas and Sigworth (1999). These experiments were performed using the same set of solutions as the macroscopic current recordings: low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. The holding potential was set to \ue032100 mV for 100 ms, and then the patch was depolarized for 700 ms in 5-or 10-mV steps from the most positive potential at which individual channel openings could be clearly observed (usually \ue03260 mV) down to \ue03290 mV. The patch was stepped down to the holding potential for 100 ms after each test pulse. Leak and capacitive currents were subtracted using an average of null sweeps. 100-1,000 current traces at each potential were idealized using the half-amplitude threshold crossing method (Colquhoun and Sigworth, 1995). These idealized records were then averaged to obtain the ensemble time course of the product of the number of channels times the open probability (NP o ). P o was obtained from these ensembles by dividing the steady-state value of NP o by the number of channels estimated from noise analysis.",

The voltage dependence of charge movement is reminiscent of that in Shaker (Zagotta et al., 1994b;Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998a).",

Error bars are the SEM. (C) Time constant of current decay \ue074 on determined from an exponential fit to the gating current decay; n = 5 patches. The red line is the average fit of Eq. 3 to all five patches; the partial charge is q on = 0.54 e o . (D) Time constant of the offgating current decay determined from an exponential fit. Note that the time constant becomes very slow and voltage independent at voltages more positive than 40 mV, which corresponds to the range of channel opening. Fig. 4 shows the data from a representative patch. Gating and tail currents can be recorded in a single sweep and at the same gain (Fig. 4 A). The number of channels in the patch was estimated from variance analysis of the inward Cs + tail current (Fig. 4 C). The single-channel Cs + current at \ue03290 mV was \ue0320.02 pA, which can be compared with \ue0321.8 pA measured in K + solutions to give a permeability ratio P Cs /P K of \ue07a0.01. This value is the same as has been measured for Shaker and other potassium channels (Heginbotham and MacKinnon, 1993; magnitude of macroscopic Cs + currents allows for precise determination of the reversal potential, at which the gating current is clearly resolved without ionic current contamination. Noise analysis of the tail current was used to determine the number of channels in the patch. The reversal potential of each patch was within \u00b1 3 mV of 0 mV, the expected reversal potential for Cs + . It should be noted that charge movement is already saturated at approximately \ue03210 mV (Fig. 2 B), which means that at 0 mV we measured all the charge available. Between 100 and 500 idealized sweeps were averaged to produce the ensembles at each voltage. (B) Measurements of the open probability of Kv1.2 channels were performed down to values between 10 \ue0327 and 10 \ue0326 . Shown are the data from six patches where the maximal open probability and channel number were measured. The apparent charge was estimated from a fit to Eq. 6 to the data between 10 \ue0327 and 10 \ue0323 . The dotted lines are the P o for a Boltzmann function elevated to the fourth power with a total charge of 10 e o (red curve), and for Scheme 1 (blue curve). The prediction from the allosteric model (Scheme 2) is shown by the lime-colored line. Both schemes have a total charge of 10 e o . The inset shows the median (9.65 e o ) and the 25th and 75th percentiles (box) and the 90th and 10th percentiles (whiskers). The mean and SEM are 9.57 \u00b1 0.24 e o . (C) The slope from the data in B is plotted as a function of P o according to Eq. 5. The data show that the limiting slope is approached at values <10 \ue0323 . The curves are model predictions as in A and have the same color coding. showing simultaneous measurement of outward gating current and inward Cs + current. The reversal potential was near zero (+1.5 mV). (B) Gating current (back trace) and its integral (red). (C) Noise analysis of the inward Cs + current. The variance versus mean relationship was fit to Eq. 4 to obtain the number of channels and the amplitude of the single-channel current at \ue03290 mV, which in this patch are 145,070 and \ue0320.023 pA, respectively. developed to account for Shaker channel gating data can be applied to explain gating in Kv1.2. There are a handful of available successful models that vary in their degree of detail and experimental constraints (Zagotta et al., 1994a;Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998b;Ledwell and Aldrich, 1999). All of them share a basic architecture. Upon depolarization, four VSDs undergo two to three independent transitions, which are mainly responsible for the observed charge movement. Once all of the VSDs reach an activated conformation, one or two more transitions, which move less charge and are produced by a concerted conformational change in all subunits, lead to the final pore opening. Our model is represented in Scheme 1 and is very similar to that presented by Ledwell and Aldrich (1999) to account for the behavior of WT Shaker and the ILT mutant, with a total of 16 closed states and a single open state. The rate constants k ij for a transition from state i to j, represented by an arrow, have the form:",

This effect is very pronounced in R2Q, where the magnitude of inward currents at negative voltages-which is proportional to the negative shift of the G(V) curveincreases severalfold with a time constant of 4.4 min However, there is a very important difference in that the gating charge is significantly reduced.

The contribution of each charge to the total gating charge was calculated as a ratio of the Q app estimates of each mutant to the Q app from voltage ramps of WT channels (Fig. 9 C). These experiments indicate that positive charges in S4 contribute to the gating charge of Kv1.2 channels in a manner that is similar to experiments in Shaker (Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996;Seoh et al., 1996), but with different relative contributions of each positive residue in S4, especially for R1.

For this reason, we could not reliably estimate the gating charge of Kv1.2-R2Q from careful limiting slope experiments as in WT Kv1.2, and we resorted to measuring the voltage-dependent conductance from currents elicited by slow (10-mV/s) voltage ramps.",

Kv1.2 subunits are found in many neurons where they assemble as a homotetramer or as part of tetramers with Kv1.1 (Dodson et al., 2002), giving rise to sustained delayed-rectifier potassium currents that activate at relatively negative potentials. These currents play a role in action potential repolarization and also limit the depolarization produced by intense synaptic inputs (Dodson et al., 2003).",

Strikingly, these calculations yielded a gating charge of \ue07a10 e o . The authors suggested that the origin of this \"anomaly\" could be traced to the position of the first arginine of S4 in the electric field, and that it should be deeper into the local electric field. Consequently, the position of R1 was fixed on steered MD simulations to force the calculation to yield a gating charge closer to the expected 13 e o . So, our data would suggest that arginine 294 might actually be pointing out in the closed state, thus being subject to a smaller fraction of the electric field.",

The first method counts channels that can bind the toxin but can underestimate the Q/N value if some channels bind toxin but do not contribute to the gating current, such as desensitized channels or channels that are down-regulated via phosphorylation or other mechanisms (O'Connell et al., 2010). Noise analysis can underestimate the number of channels if the data are sampled at low bandwidth. For heavily filtered data, the error can be as high as 10% (Alvarez et al., 2002).

In Shaker, estimates of the thickness of the septum or hydrophobic region across which the field is thought to be focused are in the order of 6-10 \u00c5 (Islas and Sigworth, 2001;Asamoah et al., 2003). In contrast, the MD simulations performed in Kv1.2/2.1 chimera and the isolated VSD show that water can penetrate in outward-and inward-facing cavities, leaving a 15-17-\u00c5 hydrophobic region across which the field can be focused (Jogini and Roux, 2007;Ramsey et al., 2010). Figure 10. Amino acid alignment of the S1, S2, and S4 regions of Kv1.2 and Shaker channels. The alignment shows the almost absolute conservation of positive (blue) and negative (red) charges shown to be involved in charge movement, salt-bridge formation, and chargeto-charge interactions. The phenylalanine at position 274 (green), proposed to act as a charge transfer center, is also conserved and occupies the same position in both channels. The obvious difference between both channels is an eleven-amino acid insertion between the S3b and S4 in Shaker (orange). Nonconserved amino acids are highlighted in light purple. The inset shows a molecular model of Shaker (brown) superimposed on a model of Kv1.2 (yellow) based on the Kv1.2-2.1 chimera structure and showing the extra loop in Shaker.",

It seems inescapable that the mutation is also changing the structure of the initial closed and/or open state. It has been proposed that R1 is close to the gating charge transfer center in the deactivated state of the VSD (Tao et al., 2010;Lin et al., 2011), which would suggest that its neutralization leads to destabilization of the initial closed state. Perhaps in our R1Q mutant, R2 moves up to occupy the original position of R1, leading to a smaller translation of S4 and thus further reducing the gating charge.",

However, the fraction of the gating charge that is reduced by neutralization of R2, R3, and R4 is less than what is observed in Shaker mutants (Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996), and markedly below the 4 e o that would be expected if the residues crossed the entire membrane field. This observation is also consistent with a scenario where the hydrophobic septum of the VSD of Kv1.2 is thicker than in Shaker, as the same translational movement of the S4 helix in a less focused electric field would result in a reduction of the electrical distance traversed by each residue and, consequently, the gating charge.",
