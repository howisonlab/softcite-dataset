Skin lesion excisions form a large proportion of a typical Australian general practitioner's (GPs) workload, and this proportion is even greater for Queensland GPs, given that this State has the highest incidence of skin cancer. 6 General practice dermatological surgery may differ from a hospital setting, with most procedures taking place in treatment rooms rather than in formal operating theatres.",

            "text": "Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the few complications of this relatively minor surgery. These infections often require antibiotics and repeat consultations to assess wound healing. They can potentially lead to significant bacteraemic complications and impair cosmetic outcome. 7 The acceptable rate of infection following clean minor surgery (class 1) is less than 5%. [8][9][10][11][12] This is reflected in skin lesion excisions, with a rate of between 1% and 3% in most studies. [13][14][15][16][17][18] The exceptions are studies conducted by the present authors in 2005 and 2009 which reported infection rates of 8.6% and 11.7%. 19 20 The reason for this higher infection rate remains unclear, but might be related to tropical humidity. Even within cohorts with a low overall incidence of infection, some procedures may be at higher risk because of the body site, pathology or patient factors and infection rates may be greater than 5% in these high-risk groups.",

If effective, this may be a low-cost and easily implemented method of reducing the incidence of SSI in selected situations. Recommendations such as these are however yet to be tested in clinical trials.

Future studies, appropriately powered to address this hypothesis, will need to adjust for such baseline difference as well as consider cluster analysis based on individual GPs to limit the confounding effect on variable training, experience and outcomes among practitioners."

Furthermore, the infection rate in studies conducted in Mackay has consistently been higher than that reported in other centres. This further adds to the argument that climate/environmental factors may be important determinants of SSI following skin lesion excision. Owing to the higher than expected infection rate, there  may be limitations to extrapolating these results to other centres, where the baseline infection is lower. However, similar relative reductions have been produced with prophylactic regimens, including single dose parenteral antibiotics, in settings with lower baseline infection rates (table 4). Antibiotic prophylaxis is probably prescribed excessively or inappropriately for dermatological surgery and is thought to be best reserved for high-risk patients such as excisions from the lower limb. 7 23 24 There are no data available on the current prescribing habits of Australian GPs regarding oral prophylaxis for minor excisions. The decision to prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis is complicated; in addition to efficacy, antibiotic costs, adverse effects and resistance must also be taken into account.",
