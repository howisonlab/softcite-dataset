SUBJECTS/METHODS: Consumption frequencies of vegetables and fruits, general characteristics, meal, health, and other variables were analyzed for a total of 147,047 adolescents who participated in the KYRBWS (Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey) conducted in 2006 and 2011 by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: Consumption frequencies of vegetables and fruits more than once a day significantly decreased in 2011 compared to 2006 based on Chi-square test conducted for every factor employed in the study. Analysis of factors showed that consumption frequencies of vegetables and fruits were reduced in both study years as subjective income decreased, whereas intake frequencies increased with mother's education level and reduction of adolescent stress level. CONCLUSIONS: In general, consumption frequencies of vegetables and fruits decreased in 2011 compared to those in 2006. Thus, future research needs to improve dietary guidelines for nutrition education in order for students to recognize the importance of food consumption and necessity of increasing daily serving sizes of vegetables and fruits for their balanced consumption.",

            "text": "Adolescence is a transitional stage from childhood to adulthood characterized by dramatic physical, emotional, and intellectual developments as well as increased intake of various nutrients. As optimal development and growth have high nutritional requirements, a well-balanced and healthy diet is essential [1,2]. However, food consumption analyses have shown that intake of rice and fresh foods such as vegetables and fruits has dropped in Korean youths, whereas intake of processed and convenience foods as well as eating-out have increased [3]. A previous study showed that an irregular eating schedule combined with inappropriate food selection reduces intake of fiber and micronutrients such as iron, calcium, zinc, folic acid, and vitamins in youths [4][5][6][7]. In particular, the result of the 2007 (IV-1) KNHANES (Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) revealed that intake of vegetables comprised only 18% of the entire diet in young Koreans [5,8].",

As the items for surveying food consumption frequency were different between the surveys in 2006 and 2011, this study first examined the distribution chart ( Table 1).

The percentages of those who consumed fruits three times a day were also below 4% in both years. As this distribution was considered inadequate to analyze vegetable and fruit consumption based on three times a day, this study reclassified '1-3 times of food consumption per day' into 'Once or more a day (\u2265 1/day)' as in the study of Heo et al. [19]. From the 2006 survey, 'Once in 6-7 days', 'Once in 4-5 days', 'Once in 2-3 days', and 'Not consumed at all in the past week' were re-coded into 'Less than once a day (< 1/day).' From the 2011 survey, '1-2 times a week', '3-4 times a week', '5-6 times a week', and 'no intake in the past week' were all re-coded into 'Less than once a day (< 1/day)' variable [19].",

The subjective economic level/standard of living was divided into 'low income', 'middle income', and 'high income' levels. Mother's education level was re-coded into 'middle school or lower', 'high school', and 'college or higher'. The meal variable used was frequency of breakfast (Variable name: F_BR). From the 2006 survey results, 'no breakfast in the past 7 days' was recoded into 'less than once a week (< 1/week)', and the remaining variables, i.e. '1-2 days a week', '3-5 days a week', and '6-7 days a week', were used from the survey. From the 2011 survey results, '0 day' was re-coded into 'less than once a week (< 1/week)'; '1 day' and '2 days' into '1-2 days a week'; '3 days', '4 days', and '5 days' into '3-5 days a week'; and '6 days' and '7 days' into '6-7 days a week'. Thus, recoding was performed the same as the categories used in the 2006 survey. Moreover, health-related and other variables included the presence or absence of nutrition education as well as subjective weight status. The presence or absence of nutrition education was divided into 'yes' for those who received education and 'no' for those who received no education. For measurement of stress level, questions used in preparing the raw data were used (Variable name: M_str, 1. feel it very much, 2. feel a lot, 3. feel a little, 4. do not feel much, 5. do not feel at all). Subjective weight status used for the analysis was divided into 'underweight', 'average', 'overweight', and 'obesity'.",

The general characteristics of the subjects as well as the frequencies of vegetable and fruit intake were examined using frequency analysis and expressed as frequency (n) and percentage (weighted %), after which chi-square (\u03c7 2 -test) was used to determine significance. The age was expressed as mean and standard error, after which t-test was used to determine significance. To identify factors affecting vegetable and fruit intake, logistic regression analysis was conducted separately on the data from 2006 and 2011 using the frequencies of vegetable and fruit intake as the dependent variables, which were recoded into 'more than once a day intake' as 1 point and 'less than once a day intake' as 0 points.

Although there was no significant difference in gender, there were slightly more boys (around 53%) represented in the data from both 2006 and 2011. Regarding school level, the most numerous group was middle school students, which constituted greater than 50% of the 2006 data. The average age in 2006 was 14.9, whereas that in 2011 was 15.2. On the other hand, more high school students (50.5%) than middle school students (49.5%) were observed in the 2011 data. Regarding residential area, the survey participants from the Gun (country) area constituted less than 10% in both survey years. The percentages of participants from small and middle cities were lower than that from large cities in 2006 but higher in 2011 (P < 0.0001). Regarding subjective economic level/ standard of living, high income level was around 30% in both years, middle income level was around 47%, and low income level was between 20-25% (P < 0.0001). Regarding mother's education level, high school was the most common (more than 50%) in both years (P < 0.0001). Regarding the presence or absence of nutrition education, the percentages of participants who received education were higher than 50% in both 2006 and 2011, and this percentage was approximately 10% higher in 2011 (63.5%) than in 2006 (54.4% ",

From the 2006 survey, all factors related to vegetable intake 'more than once a day', excluding mother's education level, showed significant effects. The frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' was 17.7% (OR = 0.823) lower in female youths than male youths, whereas it was about 1.1 times (OR = 1.057) higher in high school students than middle school students. Regarding residential area, frequencies of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' were lower in students residing in small and middle city (10.3%, OR = 0.897) as well as large city (14.9%, OR = 0.851) compared to those living in Gun (country) areas. Regarding subjective economic level/ standard of living, frequencies of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' were 11.8% lower at the middle income level (OR = 0.882) and 18.1% lower at the low income level (OR = 0.819) compared to the high income level. Regarding vegetable intake based on the presence or absence of nutrition education, frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' was 1.2 times (OR = 1.212) higher in participants who received no education compared to those who received education. In terms of stress level, the group receiving no stress showed a higher frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' compared to the group under severe stress. Correlation between subjective weight status and vegetable intake showed that the frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' was 10.6% (OR = Odds ratio (95% Confidence Interval) Table 6. Factors related to frequency of fruit consumption in adolescents 0.894) lower in the underweight awareness group and 1.1 times (OR = 1.109) higher in the obese awareness group compared to the normal awareness group. Finally, as the frequency of eating breakfast increased, the frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' also increased compared to eating breakfast 'less than once a week'. The frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' was 1.2 times (OR = 1.194) higher than those who ate breakfast '3-5 times a week' and 1.6 times (OR = 1.617) higher than those who ate breakfast '6-7 times a week'. Analysis of factors related to vegetable intake 'more than once a day' from the 2011 survey showed that all factors were significantly correlated, excluding gender and residential area. As age increased by 1 year, intake of vegetables 'more than once a day' also increased as much as 1.03 times (OR = 1.026). The frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' was 1.1 times (OR = 1.078) higher in high school students compared to middle school students. Regarding subjective economic level/standard of living, frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' was 14.9% (OR = 0.851) lower at the middle income level and 16.5% (OR = 0.835) lower at the low income level compared to the high income level. Based on mother's education level, frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' was 1.2 times (OR = 1.191) higher in the college group compared to the middle school or lower education group. The frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' was 1.2 times (OR = 1.151) higher in the group that received no education compared to those who received education. In terms of stress level, as in 2006, the group receiving no stress showed a higher frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' compared to the group under severe stress. Regarding subjective weight status, the frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' was 10.1% (OR = 0.899) lower in the underweight awareness group compared to the normal awareness group. Regarding frequency of eating breakfast, unlike the results of the 2006 survey, the frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' was 17.7% (OR = 0.823) lower in the '1-2 times a week' group and 6.9% (OR = 0.931) lower in the '3-5 times a week' group compared to the 'less than once a week' group. On the other hand, the frequency of vegetable intake 'more than once a day' was 1.4 times (OR = 1.401) higher in the '6-7 times a week' group compared to the 'less than one time' group. Table 6 shows the analysis of fruit intake-related factors in youths. From the 2006 survey, the frequency of fruit intake 'more than once a day' showed a significant correlation with all factors. Unlike vegetable intake, the frequency of fruit intake 'more than once a day' was 1.2 times (OR = 1.197) higher in girls than in boys as well as 29.5% (OR = 0.705) lower in high school students than in middle school students. As age number increased by 1 year, fruit intake 'more than once a day' decreased by 12.9%. Frequencies of fruit intake 'more than once a day' were about 1.3 times higher in small and middle cities (OR = 1.302) as well as large cities (OR = 1.342) compared to those in the Gun (country) area. Regarding differences according to subjective economic level/standard of living, the frequency of fruit intake 'more than once a day' was 34.9% (OR = 0.651) lower in youths at the middle income level and 57.6% (OR = 0.424) lower in those at the low income level compared to those at the high income level. Regarding the mother's education level, the frequency of fruit intake 'more than once a day' was 1.2 times (OR = 1.168) higher in youths whose mothers had a high school education as well as 1.7 times (OR = 1.740) higher in youths whose mothers had a college or higher compared to those whose mothers had a middle school or lower. The frequency of fruit intake 'more than once a day' in youths was 1.1 times (OR = 1.072) higher in those who received no education compared to those who received nutrition education. In terms of stress level, the group under severe stress showed a higher frequency of fruit intake 'more than once a day' compared to the group under no stress. Regarding subjective weight status, the frequency of fruit intake 'more than once a day' was 5.3% (OR = 0.947) lower in the underweight awareness group, 16% (OR = 0.840) lower in the overweight awareness group, and 18.9% (OR = 0.811) lower in the obese awareness group compared to youths in the normal awareness group. Regarding frequency of eating breakfast, the frequency of fruit intake 'more than once a day' was 1.1 times (OR = 1.149) higher in the group who ate breakfast '1-2 times a week', 1.2 times (OR = 1.150) higher in the group who ate breakfast '3-5 times a week', and 1.6 times (OR = 1.620) higher in the group who ate breakfast '6-7 times a week' compared to the group who ate breakfast 'less than once a week'.",

When frequencies of vegetable and fruit intake according to general characteristics, diet, and health-related factors were analyzed, all survey participants, gender, school level, residential area, subjective economic level/standard of living, mother's education level, presence or absence of nutrition education, subjective weight status, and frequency of breakfast intake, the frequencies were significantly reduced in 2011 compared to 2006. Reductions in consumption frequencies of vegetables and fruits corroborate the results of a previous study by Lee et al. [3] on food consumption in Korean youths, which found that consumption of fresh foods, including vegetables, fish and seafood, and fruits, decreased while consumption of processed and convenience foods as well as eating out increased in Korean youths. Furthermore, according to the 2007 KNHANES (Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), which was conducted within a similar time frame as the above study, the average daily vegetable intake of the 12-18 year age group was 222.7 g but decreased by 14.7 g over the past 4 years [20]. According to the 2011 KNHANES, the average daily vegetable intake was 207.4 g in the 10-18 year age group [21]. Regarding fruit intake, the 2007 KNHANES data showed that the average fruit daily intake was 138.4 g but decreased by approximately 4 g to 135.5 g in 2011 [8,20,21]. Based on results of previous studies, the reduced intake of vegetables and fruits did not directly affect reduction of intake frequency, whereas reduction of intake amount was somewhat correlated with reduction of intake frequency.",

In another study, sufficient vegetable and fruit intake was shown to boost resistance against diseases and prevent obesity. Furthermore, it was reported that adequate vegetable and fruit intake plays a vital role in boosting perseverance and emotional stability as well as relieving various forms of stress [1,9,12]. Particularly in Korean youths, increased intake of high-fat and high-sugar snacks resulting from emotional instability due to stress from the university entrance period, lack of sleep, an unbalanced diet, and irregular eating was shown to increase health problems, including increased incidence of obesity and various diseases [4,17,24]. Increased vegetable and fruit intake in youths will resolve not only health problems caused by a bad diet but also problems caused by stress. Moreover, more than 500 g of daily intake of vegetables and fruits is recommended for nutrition management, prevention of chronic diseases, and promotion of a balanced diet in Koreans [16]. However, as mentioned earlier, in the 2011 KNHANES, average daily vegetable and fruit intake was 342.9 g (vegetables: 207.4 g, fruits: 135.5 g) in youths between 10-18 years of age, which lags behind the recommended amount of 500 g likely due to snack intake as explained in a previous study [21]. Based on the above results, menus favorable to adolescents containing vegetables and fruits need to be developed to increase intake of vegetables and fruits.",

The general characteristics, diets, and health-related factors of the subjects were used as the independent variables. For vegetable and fruit intake-related factors from the 2006 and 2011 survey data, as the subjective economic level/standard of living decreased, intakes were reduced in the group that received nutrition education compared to the group that did not. On the other hand, vegetable and fruit intake increased with higher frequency of eating breakfast as well as mother's education level. Environmental factors, including household socioeconomic level, education level of subject's parents, and family structure, along with individual factors such as gender and age are known to affect diet in youths [25][26][27][28][29]. Furthermore, as income and education levels increase in adult women, consumption frequencies of vegetables and fruits increase [30][31][32][33]. Another study on vegetable and fruit intake in adults over 30 years of age showed that the ratio of subjects meeting daily intake volumes (more than 400 g) recommended by the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) increases as education and household income levels increase [14]. Thus, mother's education level and household income level both affect vegetable and fruit intake in Korean youths. Accordingly, national policies need to be developed to improve nutrition in low-income youths through school foodservice.",
