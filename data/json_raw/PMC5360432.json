            "text": "Impaired glycogen synthesis and turnover are common in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. As glycogen synthase (GS) is a key enzyme involved in the synthetic process, it presents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we identified a novel, potent and orally available GS activator AJS1669 {sodium 2-[[5-[[4-(4,5-difluoro-2-methylsulfanyl-phenyl) phenoxy] methyl]furan-2-carbonyl]-(2-furylmethyl)amino] acetate}. In vitro, we performed a glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) activation assay for screening GS activators and identified that the activity of AJS1669 was further potentiated in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). In vivo, we used ob/ob mice to evaluate the novel anti-diabetic effects of AJS1669 by measuring basal blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance and body fat mass index. Repeated administration of AJS1669 over 4 weeks reduced blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in ob/ob mice. AJS1669 also improved glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, and decreased body fat mass. The mRNA levels of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis were elevated in skeletal muscle tissue following AJS1669 treatment. Hepatic tissue of treated mice also exhibited elevated expression of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation. In contrast to ob/ob mice, in C57Bl/6 mice AJS1669 administration did not alter body weight or reduce glucose levels. These results demonstrate that pharmacological agents that activate GYS1, the main GS subtype found in skeletal muscle, have potential for use as novel treatments for diabetes that improve glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle."

            "text": "In humans, skeletal muscle is the major site of glucose uptake and glycogen storage, with both processes being regulated by insulin. Impaired glycogen synthesis is the major abnormality in type 2 diabetes (3,4). For example, carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance ( 13 C-NMR) spectroscopy in subjects undergoing hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamping revealed that patients with diabetes have a 50% or greater decrease in glycogen synthesis relative to healthy individuals (5). In analyses performed at the cellular level, patients with type 2 diabetes involving insulin resistance were found to have decreased glycogen synthase (GS) activity in skeletal muscle (6,7). Insulin sensitivity was found to be enhanced by exercise or weight loss associated with exercise (8)(9)(10). Exercise activates GS and enhances insulin sensitivity (11)(12)(13). Activation of GS in type 2 diabetes and correction of glucose AJS1669, a novel small-molecule muscle glycogen synthase activator, improves glucose metabolism and reduces body fat mass in mice metabolism in skeletal muscle have therefore been regarded as effective approaches to treating diabetes (14). In skeletal muscle, GS is one of the key enzymes in glucose metabolism. Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is converted to UDP-glucose, and GS forms \u03b1-1,4-glycosidic linkages, whereas branching enzymes create \u03b1-1,6-glycosidic linkages (15). There are two GS isoforms in mammals, with 69% homology. One is encoded by the glycogen synthase 2 (GYS2) gene and is expressed only in the liver, whereas the other is encoded by GYS1 and is expressed in the skeletal muscle, brain, kidneys, pancreas and adipose tissue (16,17).",

            "text": "Recently, GS activators have been developed by Roche (18,19). One of the reported compounds was shown to activate GS in the skeletal muscle and liver in a concentration-dependent manner. Repeated administration of this compound in ob/ob mice at a dose of 75 mg/kg significantly reduced the blood glucose level but did not result in weight gain. We identified AJS1669, as a novel allosteric activator of GYS1. AJS1669 activates human GYS1 (hGYS1) in a concentration-dependent manner. Its activation was found to be additive with G6P, an allosteric activator. AJS1669 accelerated not only glycogen accumulation, but also glycogen degradation in vitro, since the accumulation rate was higher with co-administration of a glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor. In the present study, we selected ob/ob mice for evaluating the effects of this compound on blood glucose level, oral glucose tolerance and \u03b2-oxidation, since AJS1669 has the potential for normalizing blood glucose levels through glycogen metabolism, similar to exercise, and ob/ob mice do not have exercise capacity. We were thus able to exclude the potential effects of exercise and increased skeletal muscle mass in our experimental design. Repeated administration of 10 mg/kg of AJS1669 over 4 weeks effectively reduced blood glucose level and improved glucose tolerance without excessive body weight gain. Excessive glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle was not observed, as reflected by in vitro testing. Moreover, fat mass was decreased, and we observed upregulation of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis in the skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that AJS1669 has potential as a new insulin sensitizer, as it reduces fat mass with upregulation of \u03b2-oxidation through acceleration of glycogen turnover. 1A) was synthesized by Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.

Group allocation was specifically designed so that no significant differences in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, body weight, and blood glucose level was observed across groups. Mice were orally administered vehicle alone (0.5% methylcellulose), with AJS1669 (3 or 10 mg/kg), or with pioglitazone (10 mg/kg) twice daily (at 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.) for 4 weeks. Body weight and food intake were monitored every 2 or 3 days. Blood samples were taken from unrestrained mice by cutting off the tip of the tail. Blood glucose levels were measured every 2 weeks using a Lifecheck sensor (Gunze, Osaka, Japan), and blood HbA1c levels was measured on day 28 (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Body composition was analyzed on day 26 using EchoMRI (EchoMRI LLC, Houston, TX, USA). EchoMRI provides a precise and accurate method for determining the fat and lean tissue content of mice without requiring anesthesia (23). Change in fat mass and lean mass were analyzed by comparing the fat mass before administration and after 4 weeks of treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) was performed following an overnight fast. After OGTT was performed, the mice were fed for another 3 days and then sacrificed. Post-mortem blood and tissue samples were collected for further analysis.",

In vitro testing showed that this compound activated hGYS1 in a concentration-dependent manner when administered alone, whereas its action was further potentiated in the presence of 2.5 mM of G6P. AJS1669 also exhibited the ability to activate skeletal muscle GS to the same extent as 3 mM G6P in assessment using lysates of mouse skeletal muscle. However, the ability of AJS1669 to activate liver GS was not stronger than its effect on skeletal muscle. AJS1669 acted potently in skeletal muscle and exhibited greater activation with a lower dose in the presence of a high G6P concentration."

Intriguingly, incubation with AJS1669 and GPI increased glycogen levels to a greater extent than did AJS1669 administered alone. In contrast, no increase was observed following incubation with a GPI alone. These observations suggest that in addition to promoting glycogen synthesis, AJS1669 caused some glycogen degradation, apparently enhancing the glycogen metabolism turnover. AJS1669 was developed as a hypoglycemic agent for transforming blood glucose into glycogen in both skeletal muscle and liver. However, if AJS1669 can ameliorate insulin resistance as a PPAR agonist, then it could be the first in a new class of insulin sensitizers."

As previously reported, the furanyl group of AJS1669 has high stability with respect to liver metabolism as it is a 5-membered ring (26). The ability of AJS1669 to reduce blood glucose levels, decrease HbA1c levels, and improve glucose tolerance was observed following 4 weeks of repeated administration ( Fig. 4). Interestingly, repeated administration of AJS1669 did not elicit a major change in food consumption. Additionally, 4 weeks of repeated administration of AJS1669 did not elevate the blood lactic acid level (data not shown). No abnormalities were observed in the plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, which reflect the liver safety profile (Table II). Similarly, C57BL/6 mice treated for 4 weeks with 30 mg/kg AJS1669 exhibited no changes in body weight, food intake, blood glucose levels, ALT levels, or AST levels (data not shown). AJS1669 therefore does not appear to reduce fat mass by any toxic mechanism.",

The same results were observed for pioglitazone-treated animals. Because both AJS1669 and pioglitazone improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 4), glycogen levels could be increased by administration of these compounds. In this study, utilizing ad libitum feeding in ob/ob mice, a significant increase in muscle glycogen may not have been detected (Fig. 5). However, AJS1669 increased the glycogen level in muscle cells, and this level was additively increased under treatment with both AJS1669 and GPI (Fig. 2). Therefore, AJS1669 increased not only glycogen accumulation but also glycogen degradation, and this machinery could improve glycogen metabolism. In exercise, both glycogen accumulation and glycogen degradation are involved in energy homeostasis and regulation of insulin sensitivity (27). Since AJS1669 improves the energy capacity of skeletal muscles, it was necessary for us to choose diabetic animals for evaluating this compound. Evaluation of these mice showed that pioglitazone treatment significantly increased the whole body fat mass (a harmful side effect), whereas AJS1669 was observed to markedly decrease the fat mass as we hypothesized (Fig. 5). AJS1669 thus appears to directly induce both glycogen synthesis and glycogen turnover, and therefore may be the first in a new class of insulin sensitizers.",

Increases in the expression of \u03b2-oxidation-related genes involved in lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscle and liver, as well as in the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, were observed following 4 weeks of repeated administration of AJS1669. Although AJS1669 treatment did not alter the expression of Gys1 in skeletal muscle tissue, it significantly increased the expression of Tfam, a gene involved in the stability and transport of mitochondrial gene transcripts. Additionally, a trend towards an increase in the expression of genes involved in \u03b2-oxidation, such as Cpt1b and Acadm, was observed following 4 weeks of repeated administration. Regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation by AJS1669 is likely to be associated with a decrease in fat mass. In the liver, no significant modulation of genes controlling gluconeogenesis was observed. As evidenced by the lack of effect on the liver observed through in vitro experiments, AJS1669 may not alter glucose metabolism by directly affecting the liver as excessive liver glycogen accumulation would inhibit the fat mass decrease (29) or reduce body fat mass by attenuating food intake in high-fat-diet model mice (30). In the present study, AJS1669 did not induce accumulation of liver glycogen or decrease fat mass. Following the upregulation of \u03b2-oxidation-related genes involved in lipid metabolism in the skeletal muscle, lipid flow may be altered across the entire body, thus affecting oxidation in the liver.",

            "text": "Although AJS1669 improved glucose homeostasis while decreasing the fat mass in ob/ob mice, this effect was not stronger than the action of pioglitazone. No significant glucose-lowering action was observed at day 17 following administration, and a longer administration period may be required to accurately demonstrate drug efficacy relative to pioglitazone. The physiological mechanism underlying this difference is currently not known, but a number of factors may be involved. AJS1669 could potentially activate GYS1 at a concentration of <1 \u00b5M in vitro (Figs. 1B and C and 2A). However, the plasma concentration of AJS1669 at 2 h after administration was below 1 \u00b5M (Fig. 3E). The dose of AJS1669 used in our experiments (10 mg/kg) may thus not be the optimal dose to elicit the desired pharmacological actions. Moreover, 4 weeks of repeated administration may result in attainment of a homeostatic phase and thus may not be an appropriate term for evaluating the maximum pharmacological effect of this compound. Our aim was to determine the length of time over which administration of AJS1669 can maintain the initial change in glucose metabolism, and we found the duration to surpass 4 weeks. Since fat mass was reduced in AJS1669-treated animals, glucose tolerance was improved, and because the mRNA levels of a number of genes were significantly altered in both skeletal muscle and liver, long-term administration may elicit stronger pharmacological effects. Another factor affecting body composition may be the difference in glycogen metabolism between muscle and liver tissue. In mice, the basal amount of glycogen in the skeletal muscle at satiation is approximately one-tenth of that in the liver, and glycogen metabolism is thought to affect glucose metabolism more significantly in the liver than in the skeletal muscle (31). In humans, however, skeletal muscle accounts for ~40% of body composition (32) and plays a central role in glucose metabolism (33). In the present study in mouse tissue lysates, AJS1669 elicited a stronger effect in the skeletal muscle than in the liver ( Fig. 2A and B), with intense effects not achieved in vivo (Fig. 3). We therefore postulate that the pharmacological effect of AJS1669 observed in mice should be far more pronounced in humans.",

            "text": "In conclusion, previous studies suggest that beneficial alterations of glycogen metabolism, similar to the physiological effects of physical exercise, may result from attenuation of GS activity in type 2 diabetes. In the present study, AJS1669 enhanced glycogen metabolism and improved mitochondrial biogenesis, and consequently elicited a reduction in body fat mass and exhibited anti-diabetic activity. AJS1669 therefore exhibits potential for use as a new insulin resistance-improving drug with a mechanism of action distinct from that of pioglitazone. AJS1669 can be regarded as a promising candidate compound for the management of type 2 diabetes. experiments. Kayo Matsumoto and Manami Shuto (Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.) who synthesized and analyzed other types of GS activators, except for AJS1669, provided us with important information. A special note of gratitude is owed to Eri Tabuchi (Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.), who analyzed the 3D structure of human Gys1 protein using information of yeast Gys2 protein and gave us great advice."
