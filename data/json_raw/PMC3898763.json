            "text": "Severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with poorer glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. It is not known whether obstructive events during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep have a different metabolic impact compared with those during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Treatment of OSA is often limited to the first half of the night, when NREM rather than REM sleep predominates. We aimed to quantify the impact of OSA in REM versus NREM sleep on hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) in subjects with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS All participants underwent polysomnography, and glycemic control was assessed by HbA 1c. RESULTS Our analytic cohort included 115 subjects (65 women; age 55.2 6 9.8 years; BMI 34.5 6 7.5 kg/m 2). In a multivariate linear regression model, REM apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was independently associated with increasing levels of HbA 1c (P = 0.008). In contrast, NREM AHI was not associated with HbA 1c (P = 0.762). The mean adjusted HbA 1c increased from 6.3% in subjects in the lowest quartile of REM AHI to 7.3% in subjects in the highest quartile of REM AHI (P = 0.044 for linear trend). Our model predicts that 4 h of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use would leave 60% of REM sleep untreated and would be associated with a decrease in HbA 1c by approximately 0.25%. In contrast, 7 h of CPAP use would cover more than 85% of REM sleep and would be associated with a decrease in HbA 1c by as much as 1%. CONCLUSIONS In type 2 diabetes, OSA during REM sleep may influence long-term glycemic control. The metabolic benefits of CPAP therapy may not be achieved with the typical adherence of 4 h per night.",

            "text": "In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that nearly 26 million American adults, 8.3% of the population, had type 2 diabetes (1). The alarming increase in overweight and obesity has played a pivotal role in the rise of type 2 diabetes prevalence. The obesity epidemic has also been associated with an increased prevalence of sleep disturbances, particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (2,3). Over the past decade, both laboratory and epidemiologic studies have identified poor sleep quality and OSA as putative novel risk factors for type 2 diabetes (4)(5)(6). OSA is a treatable chronic sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) obstruction of the upper airway. OSA leads to intermittent hypoxemia and hypercapnia, increased oxidative stress, cortical microarousals, sleep fragmentation, and chronic sleep loss. Indeed, prevalence estimates of OSA, defined as apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) $5 events per hour, in nondiabetic obese adults have ranged from 50 to 68% (7,8).",

            "text": "In recent years, evidence has accumulated to indicate that OSA is both a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and an exceptionally frequent comorbidity with an adverse impact on glycemic control. Five independent studies, totaling nearly 1,400 patients with type 2 diabetes, have shown that the prevalence of OSA (assessed by polysomnography [PSG]) ranges between 58 and 86% (9,10). Several studies have established a robust associationdindependent of adiposity and other known confoundersdbetween the presence and severity of OSA and insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in nondiabetic adults (11)(12)(13)(14). Two studies that used the gold standard of in-laboratory PSG to accurately quantify the severity of OSA reported a robust association between increasing OSA severity and increasing levels of hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) in patients with type 2 diabetes, after controlling for multiple potential confounders (9,15). While the findings of these two studies suggested that the effective treatment of OSA may be a nonpharmacologic strategy to improve glucose control, the results of the only randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on HbA 1c in patients with type 2 diabetes were surprisingly disappointing (16). One potential reason for the failure of OSA treatment to improve chronic glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is insufficient CPAP use. Notably, the mean nightly CPAP use in this clinical trial was 3.6 h. As most of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep occurs in the early morning hours before habitual awakening, one possibility is that with suboptimal adherence to CPAP therapy, obstructive apneas and hypopneas during REM sleep were disproportionately untreated compared with events in non-REM (NREM) sleep. This may be relevant to glycemic control because it is now well established that compared with NREM sleep, REM sleep is associated with greater sympathetic activity in healthy subjects as well as in patients with OSA (17)(18)(19). Further, compared with events in NREM sleep, obstructive apneas and hypopneas during REM sleep last nearly 30 s longer and are associated with significantly larger oxygen desaturation (20)(21)(22). Therefore, obstructive events during REM sleep, as compared with NREM sleep, may have a larger adverse effect on insulin release and action. This issue has major clinical implications for the duration of CPAP use that is needed to reverse the negative consequences of OSA on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. We have therefore performed a detailed analysis comparing the contributions of NREM versus REM OSA to glycemic control as assessed by levels of HbA 1c in a large cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes.",

Height and weight were measured in all participants. Selfreported ethnicity-based diabetes risk was categorized as low-risk category (non-Hispanic whites) and high-risk category (African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians). The duration of type 2 diabetes and the number of medications were verified by questionnaires as well as review of the patients' medical records. Insulin use was defined as the current use of insulin by subject's report. HbA 1c was used as clinical indicator of glycemic control. HbA 1c values (defined as the proportion of hemoglobin that is glycosylated) were obtained from the patient's chart if assessed during the previous three months (n = 17,15% of subjects) or measured on a single blood sample drawn on the morning after the PSG (n = 98, 85% of the subjects). HbA 1c was measured by Bio-Rad variant classic boronate affinity-automated highperformance liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 0.5-1.0%, and the interassay coefficient of variation was 2.  (24). Apneas were defined as total cessation of airflow for at least 10 s (obstructive if respiratory effort was present and central if respiratory effort was absent). Hypopneas were scored if the magnitude of the ventilation signal decreased by at least 50% of the baseline amplitude of the nasal pressure transducer for at least 10 s and were associated with either a 3% or greater drop in oxygen saturation as measured by finger pulse oximetry or an electroencephalographic microarousal (24). The total AHI was defined as the number of obstructive apneas and obstructive hypopneas per hour of sleep. Given the minimal presence of central apneas, we did not include these events in the calculation of AHI. The median central apnea index was 0.001 (interquartile range of 0.001-0.41), and the highest central apnea index was 5. OSA was defined as AHI $5. Severity of OSA was measured by the AHI. A subject was considered to have mild OSA if the AHI was 5-14, moderate OSA if the AHI was 15-29, and severe OSA if the AHI was $30. REM AHI was calculated as the number of apneas and hypopneas during REM sleep divided by total time in REM sleep in hours. NREM AHI was calculated by dividing the number of apneas and hypopneas during NREM sleep by total time in NREM sleep in hours. The oxygen desaturation index (ODI) was defined as the total number of oxygen desaturations of at least 3% per total sleep time (TST) in hours. The microarousal index (MAI) was calculated as the total number of microarousals per hour of sleep. ODI and MAI were also calculated during REM and NREM sleep.",

Model 1 included demographic variables traditionally associated with glycemic control, namely, age, sex, ethnicity-based diabetes risk, BMI, years of type 2 diabetes, and insulin use. Model 2 included all the covariates in model 1 plus total AHI. Model 3 included all the covariates in model 1 plus NREM AHI. Model 4 included all the covariates in model 1 plus REM AHI. Lastly, model 5 included all the covariates in model 1 plus NREM AHI and REM AHI. Since there are individuals who have a significant number of apneas and hypopneas during REM sleep while having an overall AHI below 5 (hence no OSA based on current definitions), we included all 115 subjects (with or without OSA) in the multivariate regression models in order to explore the entire spectrum of REM and NREM events (AHI, ODI, and MAI). We formally ruled out any evidence of collinearity among the variables entered in the models using standard statistics, including \"tolerance\" and \"variance inflation factor\" (SPSS Statistics v20, IBM, Armonk, NY). Values for HbA 1c , years of type 2 diabetes, and REM and NREM AHI were submitted to natural log (Ln) transformation. In order to deal with zero values, the total AHI, REM AHI, and NREM AHI were log transformed using the formula AHI = log(AHI + 0.01). A similar procedure was used for years of type 2 diabetes. We used casewise diagnostics to identify any outliers. Only one outlier was identified (low HbA 1c ), and sensitivity analysis excluding this subject was performed confirming the association between HbA 1c and measures of REM OSA severity. Goodness of fit of the models was assessed using diagnostic plots.",

The median duration of type 2 diabetes was 4 years, and a quarter of the subjects were not on any antidiabetic medication. At least one type of diabetes complication was present in 33% of the subjects (i.e., neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, coronary artery disease, or peripheral arterial disease). OSA was present in 85.2% of the participants. Mild OSA was present in 27%, moderate OSA in 28.7%, and severe OSA in 29.6% of the subjects. There were no significant differences in sex, race, BMI, years of type 2 diabetes, number of antidiabetic medications, insulin use, and HbA 1c level between subjects with and without OSA, but participants without OSA were on average 9 years younger than those with OSA. The lack of statistically significant differences in BMI and HbA 1c may have been related to the small number of subjects without OSA. The polysomnographic findings in our cohort are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. There were no significant differences in total recording time and percentage of slow wave sleep between subjects with and without OSA. However, subjects with OSA had significantly less TST and percentage of REM sleep and significantly higher wake after sleep onset. Within the participants with OSA (n = 98), REM AHI, REM ODI, and REM MAI were all significantly higher than NREM AHI, NREM ODI, and NREM MAI. The ODI was more than fourfold higher during REM than NREM sleep, but differences in MAI were more modest. Table 2 describes the results of the five multivariate linear regression models predicting HbA 1c . Model 1 demonstrates the association of HbA 1c with nonsleep variables. In model 2, the total AHI was significantly associated with higher HbA 1c (P = 0.019). Model 3 shows that NREM AHI was not associated with HbA 1c (P = 0.070). In contrast, in model 4, REM AHI was independently associated with HbA 1c (P = 0.001). In model 5, REM AHI (P = 0.008) remained a significant predictor of HbA 1c even after adjusting for NREM AHI (P = 0.762). In the final fully adjusted model 5, the independent predictors of increased HbA 1c were REM AHI (P = 0.008), race risk (P = 0.001), years of type 2 diabetes (P = 0.001), and insulin use (P , 0.001). Age, sex, BMI, and NREM AHI were not significant. Similar results were obtained when NREM AHI and REM AHI were replaced by the total number of events in NREM and REM sleep, respectively (P = 0.023 for REM events and P = 0.355 for NREM events).",

Welldocumented examples relevant to metabolic risk are pancreatic insulin secretion, hepatic glucose production, and adipocyte regulation of energy balance (25)(26)(27).

One of these studies included 13 obese patients with type 2 diabetes with severe OSA and compared them with 13 obese patients with type 2 diabetes without OSA with similar demographic characteristics. Although there was no difference in the mean diurnal glycemic level between the two groups, the mean glycemic level was 38% higher during REM sleep in those with OSA (33). The second study included 11 nondiabetic subjects. They found that in the absence of OSA, REM sleep leads to a larger decline in interstitial glucose concentration than NREM sleep. OSA during REM sleep abolished the expected decline in interstitial glucose concentration. In contrast, OSA during NREM sleep had no impact on interstitial glucose concentrations (34). Taken together, the evidence from studies assessing interstitial glucose levels supports our finding that obstructive events during REM sleep are adversely associated with glucose metabolism.",

In clinical practice, 4 h of nightly CPAP use is considered adequate adherence to therapy (37). Indeed, a randomized controlled trial of CPAP therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes reported an average use of 3.6 h per night (16). The severity of residual OSA was not estimated. The disappointing results of CPAP trial in type 2 diabetes may reflect the failure to treat REM OSA due to insufficient CPAP use, leaving most obstructive events during REM sleep untreated. Alternatively, there may be other factors beyond poor CPAP adherence that led to a lack of improvement in glycemic control such as a poor reserve in b-cell function. Our analyses show that based on the distribution of cumulative REM sleep in our cohort, CPAP therapy for the first 4 h after lights off would leave 60% of obstructive events during REM sleep untreated and would be associated with a decrease in the adjusted HbA 1c by only 0.25-0.28%.

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, we used HbA 1c , the most commonly used measure in clinical practice, to assess glycemic control. Therefore, we cannot ascertain whether the mediating pathways linking REM AHI to HbA 1c involve increased insulin resistance or impaired b-cell function. Moreover, we only measured HbA 1c at a single time point, which was not consistently on the same day as PSG. However, treatment was stable for the preceding 3 months in all participants, and HbA 1c was measured on the morning after the PSG in 98 out of 115 participants (85%). Although HbA 1c reflects glycemic control 10 to 12 weeks before the assay, it mostly reflects glucose fluctuations during the last 6 weeks of the measurement. Despite our efforts to ensure treatment stability in the prior 3 months, we cannot exclude the possibility that fluctuations in adherence to medications may have influenced HbA 1c levels. Our study did not assess associations between REM OSA and glucose control in subjects with prediabetes or normal glucose tolerance. We also had a large proportion of African Americans and subjects requiring little or no antidiabetic medications. Therefore, it would be important for our findings to be replicated in larger and more diverse cohorts, including participants with more diabetes complications and/or longer disease duration as well as individuals with prediabetes or with normal glucose tolerance but at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Also, we did not have a measure of habitual sleep duration, which may be important in evaluating chronic exposure to REM OSA, and our only measure of adiposity was the BMI. Lastly, the cross-sectional nature of the study does not address the direction of causality. Indeed, only rigorously designed intervention studies will provide causal evidence between disordered breathing during REM sleep and glucose metabolism dysregulation.",

Since REM sleep is dominant during the latter part of the sleep period, REM-related OSA may often remain untreated with 4 h of CPAP use. Our analyses suggest that to achieve clinically significant improvement in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, CPAP use may need to be extended beyond 6 h per night. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanistic pathways linking OSA during REM sleep and adverse metabolic outcomes.",

A: Data are summarized as mean 6 SD of cumulative REM and NREM sleep minutes from lights off to lights on in 115 subjects with type 2 diabetes. The mean duration of REM and NREM sleep in our cohort was 82 and 298 min, respectively. Using CPAP for 3 or 4 h from the time lights are turned off will cover only 25 or 40% of REM sleep, respectively, and will leave most obstructive events during REM sleep untreated. In contrast, 7 h of CPAP use would treat 87% of REM sleep.

With this simulation, 4 h of CPAP use would treat 40% of REM sleep and would lead to a drop in adjusted HbA 1c of 0.23-0.28%. In contrast, 7 h of CPAP therapy would treat 87% of REM sleep and lead to a decrease in adjusted HbA 1c between 0.87 and 1.1%.
