Materials and Methods: A cylindrical object made from nylon with radiopaque markers (phantom) was scanned by i-CAT and PreXion 3D devices. For each axial image, measurements were taken twice in the horizontal (distance A-B) and vertical (distance C-D) directions, randomly, with a one-week interval between measurements, by four oral radiologists with five years or more experience in the use of these measuring tools. Results: All of the obtained linear measurements had lower values than those of the phantom. The statistical analysis showed high intra-and inter-observer reliability (p = 0.297). Compared to the real measurements, the measurements obtained using the i-CAT device and PreXion tomography, on average, revealed absolute errors ranging from 0.22 to 0.59 mm and from 0.23 to 0.63 mm, respectively. Conclusion: It can be concluded that both scanners are accurate, although the linear measurements are underestimations, with no significant differences between the evaluators."

            "text": "Linear measurements are mainly used to assess the thickness and height of the alveolar crest as part of the preoperative evaluation for implant treatment, to measure the distance between anatomical landmarks in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery, and to estimate the size of pathological jaw lesions. The accuracy and reliability of linear measurements in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images has been established in several published scientific studies, 1,[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] including studies where they have been obtained from CBCT-derived models. 2,12 Ostensibly, in imaging of the oral and maxillofacial complex, spatial resolution is an important parameter of image quality that appears to be of special interest for dental applications. As available spatial resolution also determines the accuracy with which anatomic detail can be measured, it also affects important procedures, such as the planning of dental implants or cephalometric analysis. The spatial resolution of an image is directly influenced by the voxel size, which is the smallest unit in CBCT images. [13][14][15][16] To improve spatial resolution, the voxel size must be reduced, 17 and the CBCT images must be measured accurately. However, spatial resolution is affected by multiple technical factors that make it difficult to predict from simple clues or to estimate from technical parameters. 13 The presence of an increasing number of CBCT units on the market presents a need to understand and select from the various technical parameters.",

In our study, the intra-observer and inter-observer agreement values, when using the i-CAT or PreXion scanner, were excellent in all comparisons of the 4 examiners (ICC = 1.000), as shown in Tables 1 and 2. High interobserver and intraobserver CBCT reliability was reported by Moshfeghi et al. 11 and Kamburo\u011flu et al. 7 , while in the study by Nikneshan et al. 1 , reproducibility for all orientations was greater than 0.9.",

Lukat et al. 21 have already reported this result and emphasized that high spatial resolution allows for the thorough detection of subtle structures, such as small changes in the cortical or the buccal bone of the temporomandibular joint. 3,5,22 Measurements for preoperative implant site assessment taken from CBCT images should be considered accurate when the error was less than 1 mm. 4,15 Owing to the mechanical construction of CBCT machines, which require a relatively slow trajectory of the source image detector unit around the patient's head, even slight patient movement seems almost inevitable. Given the small voxel sizes applied in the machines, a slight movement of more than 1 voxel will lead to errors in reconstruction. 13 Therefore, during clinical application, one should not expect greater accuracy than half a millimeter at best. If in doubt, users should avoid sub-millimeter accuracy and preferably add some margin of error to their planning. Table 1 shows the values of the measurements obtained using the i-CAT apparatus, on average, which produced absolute errors ranging from 0.22 mm to 0.59 mm compared with the actual measurements, which were underestimated. As for the PreXion device, the measurements were lower than the actual linear dimensions, with absolute error varying between 0.23 mm and 0.63 mm, in accordance with the results of the study from Waltrick et al. 14 that reported mean absolute errors of 0.23\u00b10.2 mm using voxel sizes of 0.2 mm, 0.3 mm, and 0.4 mm.",
