The effectiveness of these features was evaluated using CareLink \u00d2 software data. Methods: Anonymized data from MiniMed 640G system users (n = 4818), MiniMed 530G system users (n = 39,219), and MiniMed Paradigm \u00d2 Veo\u00d4 system users (n = 43,193) who voluntarily uploaded pump and sensor data were retrospectively analyzed. Comparisons were made between days in which system features were enabled at any time and those in which they were not. Comparisons were also made between pump suspension events for which insulin delivery was automatically or manually resumed and between glycemic parameters of users who switched from the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system to the MiniMed 640G system. Results: Days in which the MiniMed 640G ''suspend before low'' feature was enabled had lower percentages of SG readings \u00a370 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or \u2021240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) than days when it was not enabled (P < 0.001 for each). Users who switched from the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system to the MiniMed 640G system had fewer excursions below \u00a370 mg/dL (P < 0.001) and \u2021240 mg/dL (P < 0.001). SG values following automatically resumed pump suspension events recovered more rapidly and had a more stabilized endpoint than following manually resumed events. Conclusions: Automated insulin management features of the MiniMed 640G system can reduce the frequency of both high and low SG values and help stabilize SG after resumption of insulin delivery.",

            "text": "S ensor-augmented pump systems provide insulin delivery and continuous glucose monitoring therapies that can improve the management of diabetes. The MiniMed Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 530G systems (Medtronic, Northridge, CA) are capable of suspending insulin delivery in response to sensor glucose (SG) values at or below a prespecified threshold (Low Glucose Suspend [LGS] and Threshold Suspend [TS], respectively) ( Table 1). The suspension automatically resumes (''auto-resume'') in 2 hours unless basal insulin delivery is manually resumed. Four hours after automatic insulin delivery resumption, the threshold suspend feature of both systems can allow resuspension of insulin delivery if the sensor glucose is still at or below prespecified threshold. This feature significantly reduces the severity and duration of hypoglycemic events once they occur, and has a salutary effect on the frequency of such events. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] In addition to a threshold suspend feature (''suspend on low''), the MiniMed 640G system (Medtronic) can suspend insulin delivery based on predicted hypoglycemia (''suspend before low'') ( Table 1), which can reduce the frequency of hypoglycemic events to a greater extent. 8,9 When ''suspend before low'' is enabled, basal insulin delivery is stopped if the SG value is predicted to reach or fall below a preset low limit within 30 min. Similar to the MiniMed Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 530G systems, basal insulin delivery can be manually resumed at any time during a suspend event and automatically resumes after 2 hours. In contrast, ''auto-resume'' can occur sooner if, at 30 min since the start of pump suspension, the SG value is above the low limit and predicted to remain above the low limit within 30 min.",

Voluntarily uploaded and anonymized data were captured from CareLink software. To compare SG trajectories associated with different types of pump suspension, user-days were assigned to the feature (i.e., predictive ''suspend before low'' or reactive ''suspend on low'') in use during that day. The threshold range for the MiniMed 640G ''suspend before low'' and ''suspend on low'' was 50-90 mg/dL (3.3-5.0 mmol/L). The threshold range for the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system was 40-110 mg/dL (2.2-6.1 mmol/L) and that for the Mini-Med 530G was 60-90 mg/dL (2.8-5.0 mmol/L). While the MiniMed Paradigm Veo LGS and the MiniMed 530G TS features differ in suspend threshold range, they are considered functionally equivalent. 2 For simplicity, the threshold suspend features in all three systems have been referred to as ''suspend on low''. Pump suspension events were characterized according to whether insulin delivery was resumed automatically or manually. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were defined as SG values \u00a370 mg/dL (\u00a33.9 mmol/L) and 240-300 mg/dL (13.3-16.7 mmol/L), respectively, and were compared across systems using a Kruskal-Wallis analysis. Severe hyperglycemia was defined as \u2021300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L). Hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic excursions were defined as \u20212 consecutive hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic SG values per day or night (8:00 PM-8:00 AM) and, in addition to area under the glucose concentration-time curve (AUC), were compared between the MiniMed Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 640G systems using a Wilcoxon signed-rank analysis.",

In 2015, Dexcom reported data from 300 users of their Platinum G4 \u00d2 CGM system, 12 in which users experienced a mean of 1.2 -1.9 (Mean -SD) hours per day with sensor readings \u00a370 mg/dL, half of which were at night. This rate is in agreement with data from users of Medtronic CGM systems on nights when system suspend functions were not used. As shown in Table 2, the duration of nocturnal hypoglycemia was reduced by *50% with use of the MiniMed Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 530G ''suspend on low'' features, and was reduced by *75% with use of the MiniMed 640G ''suspend before low'' feature. This reduction in hypoglycemia exposure (i.e., number of events) attributable to the predictive insulin pump suspension technology in the MiniMed 640G system agrees with that reported in a recent study of children and adolescents that found slight elevations in overnight mean glucose levels and no increase in morning blood ketosis on nights that pump suspensions occurred. 13 The hypoglycemia prevention attributable to the MiniMed 640G system was also measured in a recent Predictive Low Glucose Management (PLGM) pivotal study, 14 in which standardized increases in basal insulin delivery were used to trigger insulin pump suspension. A 60% reduction in hypoglycemia was reported based on 68 automatic pumpsuspension events, among which the hypoglycemic criterion (two or more reference plasma glucose levels of <65 mg/dL) did not occur in 41 cases. This is less than the 75% prevention rate reported here and the 83% prevention rate reported in a PLGM user evaluation study. 8 The smaller reduction observed in the pivotal study was likely due to the basal insulin delivery escalation protocol known to result in hypoglycemia 93% of the time, 15 relative to the day-to-day environment settings of the later studies.",

It is not known what user characteristics or physiologic and metabolic factors may have influenced the different extent of manual resumption between the systems. The ''auto resume'' based on SG feature, not available in MiniMed Paradigm Veo or MiniMed 530G systems, appeared to allow a more immediate real-time solution for maintaining target glucose levels. Specifically, there was a faster hypoglycemia recovery and less glycemic variability (as measured by the CV of SG values), compared to users who restart the pump manually.",

A limitation of the study is that the MiniMed 640G ''suspend on low'' versus MiniMed 640G ''suspend before low'' data could not be analyzed, due to an insufficient number of events during use of the former feature. The lack of detailed user demographic information is another limitation, as is a lack of detailed information regarding user-system interface (e.g., calibrations, sensor changes, and CareLink software upload frequency), physician-touser instructions, and dietary and exercise behaviors. The false-positive rate of predictive pump suspensions, as well as sensor accuracy, could not be assessed because of the study's retrospective nature. The effect of sensor life on the rate of pump suspension events was also not possible to assess. Within-user comparisons of MiniMed Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 640G system use may have been influenced by the unidirectional nature of the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system use preceding MiniMed 640G system use, and by uncharacterized or unknown behaviors related to becoming familiar with a new pump system.",

In other outpatient studies, HCL systems outperformed sensoraugmented pumps in terms of glucose control, time in hypoglycemia, and glycated hemoglobin levels. 16,17 The MiniMed 640G system is the first commercially available system to offer predictive suspension and automatic resumption, based on SG, of basal insulin delivery.
