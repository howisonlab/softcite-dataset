            "text": "Various environmental oxidative stresses are sensed by redox-sensitive regulators through cysteine thiol oxidation or modification. A few zinc-containing anti-sigma (ZAS) factors in actinomycetes have been reported to respond sensitively to thiol oxidation, among which RsrA from Streptomyces coelicolor is best characterized. It forms disulfide bonds upon oxidation and releases bound SigR to activate thiol oxidative stress response genes. Even though numerous ZAS proteins exist in bacteria, features that confer redox sensitivity to a subset of these have been uncharacterized. In this study, we identified seven additional redox-sensitive ZAS factors from actinomycetes. Comparison with redoxinsensitive ZAS revealed characteristic sequence patterns. Domain swapping demonstrated the significance of the region K 33 FEHH 37 FEEC 41 SPC 44 LEK 47 that encompass the conserved HX 3 CX 2 C (HCC) motif. Mutational effect of each residue on diamide responsive induction of SigR target genes in vivo demonstrated that several residues, especially those that flank two cysteines (E39, E40, L45, E46), contribute to redox sensitivity. These residues are well conserved among redox-sensitive ZAS factors, and hence are proposed as redox-determinants in sensitive ZAS. H37A, C41A, C44A and F38A mutations, in contrast, compromised SigR-binding activity significantly, apparently affecting structural integrity of RsrA. The residue pattern around HCC motif could therefore serve as an indicator to predict redoxsensitive ZAS factors from sequence information.",

            "text": "Bacteria respond to environmental changes primarily by changing transcription profiles in gene expression. An efficient way of changing transcriptome globally is to use alternate sigma factors, whose activities are elaborately controlled via various sensing mechanisms including anti-sigma factors (1,2). Among s 70 family of sigma factors, which contain conserved DNA-binding domains for recognizing \u00c035 and \u00c010 regions of promoters, group 4 or extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors, are the most abundant and diverse subclass (3)(4)(5)(6). They constitute $60% of all s 70 family of sigma factors predicted from bacterial genomes. About one-third of their genes lie next to genes for anti-sigma factors containing structurally conserved sigma-binding (anti-sigma) domain (3). A prototypical example of the group 4 sigma-anti-sigma pair is RpoE-RseA of Escherichia coli (Eco) that respond to a variety of cell envelope stresses (7,8).",

There have been some indications that SigH of Corynebacterium glutamicum could be regulated by its cognate anti-sigma factor in a similar way as ScoSigR or MtuSigH (25,26). However, experimental evidence for redox-sensitive regulation of its anti-sigma factor has been lacking. Another ZAS from M. tuberculosis, RslA, which regulates SigL has been proposed to be redox-sensitive on the basis of disulfide bond formation in vitro by treating 10 mM H 2 O 2 (27). However, since SigL does not respond to oxidative stress in vivo (17), it may not respond as sensitively to thiol oxidative stress in vivo as ScoRsrA and MtuRshA do. YlaD, which binds its cognate sigma factor YlaC in B. subtilis, has been controversial in terms of redox sensitivity (28,29). However, since its inactivation was observed only under high concentration of H 2 O 2 (2.5 mM) in vitro (29), it can be regarded relatively insensitive to thiol oxidation. Other ZAS factors such as RspChrR, BsuRsiW, and ScoRsuA have all been reported to be insensitive to thiol oxidants (11,(13)(14)(15).",

For this purpose, a modified overlapping PCR was done (37). For swapped RsrA (S-RsrA), the primer pair S-RsrAP1 (5 0 tcg cg cat atg agc tgc gga3 0 ) and S-RsrAP2 (5 0 CTC GCA TGT CTC CAG ATG TTC ATT TAA TAC cac gca gtc cga gtc cgg3 0 ) were used to create the upstream half, and the pair S-RsrAP3 (5 0 CTG GAG ACA TGC GAG AAA TGC AGA AAG CAT tac ggg ctg gag cag gcc3 0 ) and S-RsrAP4 (5 0 gac gct cag gga tcc tca gga ctc3 0 ) were used to create the downstream half, which overlap by 15 complementary nucleotides. The capital letters indicate swapped sequence. The second PCR from partially hybridized half templates were done with the primer pair S-RsrAP1 and S-RsrAP4 to create the entire open reading frame for S-RsrA. For swapped and trunctated RsiW (ST-RsiW), the primer pair ST-RsiWP1 (5 0 agg tga gga tcc atg agc tgt3 0 ) and ST-RsiWP2 (5 0 CGA GCA CTC CTC GAA GTG GTG CTC GAA CTT gtg ttc atc ttt tgg aag3 0 ) were used to generate the upstream half, and the primers ST-RsiWP3 (5 0 TTC GAG GAG TGC TCG CCC TGC CTG GAG AAG ttt tac gag atg gag aaa3 0 ) and ST-RsiWP4 (5 0 tgc gca tgc tca atg ggt tct gaa cca tct3 0 ) were used to generate the downstream half, which overlap by 15 complementary nucleotides. The second PCR was done with ST-RsiWP1 and ST-RsiWP4. The final PCR product for S-RsrA was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and cloned into the the NdeI/BamHI site of pUC19sigRrsrA-NB to substitute the rsrA gene, followed by recloning into pSET152H and introduction to the DsigRrsrA mutant of S. coelicolor as described above. The final PCR product for ST-RsiW was inserted into the HindIII/SphI site of pALrsiW (14) to replace the wild-type rsiW gene. The resulting pAL-ST-rsiW plasmid was introduced into the B. subtilis 1012-1 strain, which is resistant to neomycin and spectinomycin resistant (Neo R and Spc R ), to replace the Spc R gene in the lacA locus with the erythromycin resistance (Erm R ) gene (14) ( Supplementary Table S1). Transformants (Neo R , Erm R and Spc S ) were selected to isolate 1012-ST-rsiW strain. To knock out the wild-type rsiW gene in the 1012-ST-rsiW strain, the rsiW::Spc R chromosome was introduced into the strain. The ST-rsiW strain was selected by antibiotics (Neo R , Erm R and Spc R ) and confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. Consequently, the ST-rsiW gene at the lacA locus is under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter (14). The recombinant B. subtilis strains were grown in LB with appropriate antibiotics, and 0.1-mM IPTG was added to induce RsiW variants. For oxidative stress, LB-grown cultures were treated with 1 mM diamide at OD 600 of 0.7 for varying lengths of time before cell harvest.",

Following S1 nuclease treatment, the protected DNA probes were loaded on 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea, and the radioactive signals were detected and quantified by BAS-2500 system (Fuji).",

Four reported redox-insensitive ZAS members were included in the phylogenetic analysis for comparison. These are RspChrR, BsuYlaD, BsuRsiW and ScoRsuA. Only the N-terminal ASD domain was included in multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction. The phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the majority of the retrieved homologs cluster closely with ScoRsrA (Group I), next to the second cluster (Group II), which harbors CglRshA from C. glutamicum (25). Known insensitive ZAS genes were clustered within Groups III and IV. For experimental analysis, we selected nine candidates from dispersed branches of group I and group II clusters (Figure 1, open circles); Rv3221A (MtuRshA), MSMEG_1915 (M. smegmatis), BlinB_ 010200019545 (Brevibacterium linens), nfa45830 (Nocardia farcinica), RHA1_ro06382 (Rhodococcus jostii), FRAAL6009 (Frankia alni), Tfu_0549 (Thermobifida fusca), DIP0710 (C. diphtheria) and AAur_2640 (Arthrobacter aurescens). A candidate from a branch in Group IV, NCgl0852 (C. glutamicum), was also selected for experimental analysis. The corresponding genes were synthesized through PCR amplification of chromosomal DNA as described in 'Materials and Methods' section. We Figure 1. Phylogenetic relatedness of ScoRsrA homologs.

Sequence information for all entries is provided in the Supplementary Table S3. cloned these genes in pSET152H to replace the rsrA gene in the sigR-rsrA operon of S. coelicolor as diagramed in Figure 2A. The resulting hybrid operons were introduced into the chromosome of DsigRrsrA strain through the att site. If the product of the cloned gene behaves similarly to ScoRsrA, it is expected to bind SigR in S. coelicolor and keep it inactive under non-stressed condition, but will release SigR to transcribe its target genes under oxidative stress conditions. We analyzed transcripts from SigRdependent sigRp2 and trxBp1 promoters by S1 mapping in various recombinant S. coelicolor strains before and after treatment with 0.5-mM diamide for varying lengths of time. Figure 2B shows representative S1 results, which demonstrate that several homologs behave similarly as ScoRsrA and thus deserve to be called its orthologs. For example, Tfu_0549, FRAAL6009, RHA1_ro06342, BlinB_010200019545, nfa45830, MSMEG_1915 and AAur_2640 kept ScoSigR sufficiently inactive under non-stressed conditions (0 min), and transiently allowed A B Figure 2.

However, it responded to diamide induction as expected (12). On the other hand, those from Corynebacterium spp. (NCgl0852 and DIP0710) appeared inactive in binding SigR, since the basal-level expression of both sigRp2 and trxBp1 transcripts were constitutively high regardless of diamide treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to assess their redox sensitivity by our analyses. Considering a difference in GC content between Corynebacterium (54%) and S. coelicolor (72%) genomes, there also exist a possibility that not enough corynebacterial ZAS proteins are expressed due to codon bias and other post-transcriptional defects. We quantified S1 results from more than three independent experiments for each recombinant strain, and presented diamide sensitivity of each homolog as fold-induction values compared with the unstressed level (Supplementary Figure S1). This analysis, therefore, allowed us to identify seven new redox-sensitive ZAS factors, which appear to be functional orthologs of ScoRsrA in binding sigma factor SigR and responding to thiol oxidative stress.",

Production of ST-RsiW or T-RsiW was controlled by IPTG (14), and the amount of auto-regulated sigW transcripts following diamide treatment was examined by S1 mapping. Figure 4B demonstrates that when T-RsiW is induced, sigW expression is drastically reduced, confirming the ability of T-RsiW to bind and sequester SigW.

When diamide was treated, the expression level increased up to about 4-fold after 40 min of treatment, and then decreased to the basal level at 80 min. This result demonstrates that the HCC region of ScoRsrA conferred redox sensitivity to the insensitive RsiW.",

Figure 5 exhibits profiles of the sigRp2 expression in the mutants, in comparison with that in the wild-type (black curve). It was evident from the graph that some mutations affected SigRspecific expression drastically in such a way to elevate the un-stressed level and lower fold-induction accordingly ( Figure 5A and C). These mutations are H37A, C41A, C44A and F38A. These residues are those that are very well conserved in all ZAS, including F38 which shares similar hydrophobicity with the conserved leucine at this position (Figure 3). Since the highly elevated level of basal expression reflects free dissociated SigR, these mutations must have damaged the integrity of the overall structure of RsrA. The swapped S-RsrA was also examined by this assay, and demonstrated very low induction, consistent with the observation in Figure 4C. The rest of the mutants exhibited relatively subtle effects ( Figure 5B). Under non-stressed condition, they showed low basal-level expression of sigRp2 comparable with the wild-type, indicating that the mutations did not damage the structural integrity or the activity of RsrA to bind SigR. Regarding diamide sensitivity, some behaved almost like the wild-type whereas the others showed less sensitive induction. F34A produced widely varying results. In order to normalize different levels of basal expression and maximum induction level, we re-plotted the expression data of Figure 5A and B to present changes in induction fold for each mutant (Figure 5C and D). The graphs in Figure 5B and D can be regarded as dose-dependent response curves typically observed in enzyme-or pharmaco-kinetic analyses. We therefore applied Lineweaver-Burk equations to fit the data and calculated the concentration of diamide that caused 50% maximal induction for each mutant, defined as ID IF50 (induction dose at 50% maximum induction fold) or ID EL50 (induction dose at 50% maximum expression level). ID EL50 and ID IF50 values were very close to each other. The quantified values for the basal level sigRp2 expression and ID IF50 were summarized in Table 1. Compared with the wildtype (ID IF50 of 39.5 mM diamide), several mutants showed significant increases in ID IF50 values. For example, K33A, H36A, E39A, E40A, S42A, L45A and E46A caused elevation of ID IF-50 by more than 2-fold, implying that these residues contribute to redox sensitivity. Relatively larger effects were observed in L45A, E40A, E46A and E39A mutants by 7.7, 4.8, 4.0 and 3.2-fold increases in ID IF50 , Figure 5. Redox sensitivies of Ala-scanned ScoRsrA mutants. Each of the 15 residues from K33 to K47 in ScoRsrA was changed to alanine in recombinant S. coelicolor strains that harbor mutated rsrA in sigR-rsrA operon inserted at the att site of the DsigR-rsrA strain. Cells were grown to OD 600 of $0.3 in YEME and treated with varying concentrations of diamide (0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 mM) for 10 min. Following S1 mapping, the normalized sigRp2 signal values were plotted either as expression levels (A and B) or induction fold (C and D) against diamide concentrations. For expression values, the uninduced basal level of the wild-type was set as 1.0. For induction folds, the uninduced levels of all strains were set as 1.0. Mutants that constitutively induced SigR-specific expression were presented separately (panels A and C) from those that affected primarily sensitivity to diamide (panels B and D). Quantified values for induction folds were presented in Table 1. respectively. These residues flank the two conserved cysteines (C41 and C44) and show pronounced conservation among sensitive ZAS members.",

Two candidates from C. glutamicum and C. diphtheria were not eligible for our assay, since they appear incapable of binding ScoSigR under unstressed conditions, resulting in constitutive expression of SigR target genes. Considering the difference in GC content, there is also a possibility that not enough proteins were expressed. The high success rate of finding sensitive ZAS leads to a prediction that the majority of the retrieved homologs, especially those of groups I and II (Figure 1), are likely to be functional orthologs of ScoRsrA, regulating SigR-like sigma factor encoded from a neighboring gene, in response to thiol oxidative stresses. Since our assay was restricted by the ScoSigR-binding ability of the homolog, only close homologs that can bind ScoRsrA can be evaluated for their redox sensitivity. If a more generalized assay that utilizes cognate sigma factor were available, it is expected that a broader spectrum of sensitive ZAS proteins could be evaluated.",

Another highly conserved hydrophobic residue F38 (leucine in most other cases) showed similar effect. Based on biochemical analyses of SigR binding and disulfide bond formation, loss of zinc in ScoRsrA is known to decrease its binding affinity to ScoSigR (19) and to render RsrA more labile to oxidation (20). For ScoRsrA, whose structural information is not yet available, the zinc-binding residues are not well resolved. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy of a mutant form of RsrA, where non-conserved cysteines (C3, C31, C61, C62) were all substituted with alanines, suggested that the bound zinc closely interacts with C11, H37, C41 and C44, in a way similarly observed in the structure of RspChrR as observed previously (10,21). Assessment of zinc content in various ScoRsrA mutants suggested the possibility of C3 and H7 in the extended N-terminal loop, in addition to C41 and C44, to participate in zinc binding (19). Even though the H37-corresponding residue in ChrR structure (H31) serves as a zinc ligand, its mutation did not affect anti-sigma activity of ChrR, implying that it may contribute marginally to zinc-binding affinity (3). Similarly weak interaction between H37 and zinc has been reported (19,21). Therefore, the conserved H37 may contribute further in determining ScoRsrA structure beyond serving as a zinc-binding ligand. Based on these studies, it is highly likely that C41 and C44 are involved in zinc Table 1. SigR-binding activity and diamide sensitivity of RsrA variants binding. However, identification of additional zinc ligands in ScoRsrA requires further studies. Whether zinc binds to more than two alternative sites, and whether these alternative forms are at equilibrium in the cell remain open for deeper investigation. More systematic analyses combined with structural studies are in need to get better understanding of zinc-binding in ScoRsrA.",

These four residues immediately flank the two conserved cysteines (C41 and C44), and show pronounced differential conservation among sensitive ZAS members ( Figure 6). In this respect, the presence of negatively charged residues (DE) preceding C41, and a hydrophobic (L) and a charged residue (R/E) following C44, could be a critical determinant of redox sensitivity. The P43A mutation did not change sensitivity significantly, but lowered the basal level by about 2-fold (Table 1). This suggests that the mutation could have caused tighter binding of SigR under unstressed condition.",

Protein thiols with low pKa value get easily deprotonated, and exist as an anionic thiolate form. Zinc can lower pKa of the protein thiol through stabilizing the thiolate form, and thus is capable of increasing the reactivity of cysteine thiols toward electrophilic oxidants and alkylating compounds (42). However, the actual reactivity of the zinc-thiol (or thiolate) center also depends on its structural environment that includes hydrogen bonding, dielectric properties, electrostatic screening, and protein packing (42)(43)(44). For example, an increase in the steric and electrostatic shielding of anionic zinc cores in zinc fingers is correlated with a decrease in their reactivity (43).",

In this respect, the binding affinity as well as the flexibility in choosing ligands of zinc are likely to affect the reactivity of active-site cysteine (C41 in ScoRsrA), which most likely is located in the middle of the loop between helixes 2 and 3 of the ASD (3). Therefore, one can hypothesize that the zinc binding to (H)CC motif in sensitive ZAS could be weaker and/or more flexible relative to that in insensitive ZAS, due to the specified residue environment of the motif. Further comparative studies of sensitive versus insensitive ZAS are in need to find whether any differences in zinc-binding properties, if present, contribute to determine redox sensitivity.

Studies on the sequence variation of dipeptide sequence in the CXXC motifs of thioredoxin and related proteins revealed that cysteine reactivity depends not only on pKa and redox potential values, but also on interacting partners (45)(46)(47). Since nearly all RsrA in the reduced cytoplasm is thought to exist as a bound complex with SigR, the interacting SigR environment around the reactive zinc-thiol center can also contribute to redox sensitivity. The HCC motif, which spans from the C-terminal end of helix 2 to the N-terminal end of helix 3, is modeled to be relatively exposed to the surface, away from the interacting sigma factor (3). However, the remaining residues of helixes 2 and 3, especially helix 3, are thought to interact heavily with the bound sigma factor. In the absence of structural information on SigR-RsrA complex, it is not possible to delineate residues that interact with SigR. A structural model based on the template of RpoE-ChrR complex structure suggests that S42 and E46 in helix 3 are positioned toward the SigR-interacting face (C.O. Seok, personal communication). However, the relatively distant sequence relatedness between ScoSigR and RspRpoE hinders precise modeling. To assess the contribution from the interacting sigma factor, precise structural information on SigR-RsrA interaction is in need.",

A sensitive motif for cysteine S-nitrosylation in proteins that are nitrosylated by S-nitroso-glutathione has also been proposed (49). In this study, a new type of redox-sensitive motif in zinc-bound ASD has been suggested. Considering the growing list of redox-regulated proteins, where disulfide bonds serve as switches for modulating various functional aspects such as localization, interaction and stability, we expect this study to add a new insight in finding novel redox-sensitive proteins (41). Further biochemical and structural analyses will reveal the mechanism behind the redox-determining function of specific residues in this class of proteins, and give insight in understanding the mechanism behind redox-sensing in other zinc proteins.",
