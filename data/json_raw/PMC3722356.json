            "text": "Psychopathy is a personality disorder associated with a profound lack of empathy. Neuroscientists have associated empathy and its interindividual variation with how strongly participants activate brain regions involved in their own actions, emotions and sensations while viewing those of others. Here we compared brain activity of 18 psychopathic offenders with 26 control subjects while viewing video clips of emotional hand interactions and while experiencing similar interactions. Brain regions involved in experiencing these interactions were not spontaneously activated as strongly in the patient group while viewing the video clips. However, this group difference was markedly reduced when we specifically instructed participants to feel with the actors in the videos. Our results suggest that psychopathy is not a simple incapacity for vicarious activations but rather reduced spontaneous vicarious activations co-existing with relatively normal deliberate counterparts.",

Dominant models of psychopathy focus on two processes. Some posit that deficits in instrumental learning are central to psychopathy, preventing individuals with psychopathy from associating their antisocial behaviour with the negative affect that should be triggered by the distress of their victims (Blair, 2007). Others posit that deficits in attention might be central, with individuals with psychopathy having relatively preserved deliberate 'topdown' attention, but abnormal automatic, 'bottom-up' attention (Moul et al., 2012). This imbalance would prevent subjects from adequately processing certain stimuli (e.g. distress cues) that are peripheral to their current goals (e.g. obtaining resources) (Patterson and Newman, 1993).",

However, a number of studies provide indirect evidence that warrants investigating vicarious activations directly in psychopathy. These studies show that psychopathic individuals display reduced physiological (Aniskiewicz, 1979;Blair et al., 1997;Perkins et al., 2010), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal (M\u00fc ller et al., 2003; but see Harenski et al., 2010) and electroencephalography (Cheng et al., 2012) responses to social emotional stimuli; recognize emotions less accurately from voices or faces (Blair et al., 2002(Blair et al., , 2004Kosson et al., 2002;Hastings et al., 2008); are less likely to attribute guilt to the protagonist in stories (Blair et al., 1995), and have a weaker BOLD response in their premotor and primary somatosensory cortices while they observe faces in a gender discrimination task (Deeley et al., 2006; but see Dolan and Fullam, 2006). Reduced activations in insular, cingulate and secondary somatosensory cortices were also found during fear conditioning (Birbaumer et al., 2005), and in the cingulate cortex and inferior frontal gyrus while memorizing negative words (Kiehl et al., 2001), further pointing to functional deficits in brain regions that are known to be involved in vicarious responses. In addition, grey matter has also been found to be reduced in regions associated with vicarious responses (de Oliveira-Souza et al., 2008;but see M\u00fc ller et al., 2008;Tiihonen et al., 2008;Yang et al., 2009;Schiffer et al., 2011). However, as these studies did not directly investigate whether regions involved in feeling one's own emotions are recruited abnormally in psychopathic individuals while viewing the emotions of others, it is impossible to conclude from this body of research that vicarious activations are reduced in individuals with psychopathy.",

            "text": "To directly test this question, we developed short video clips of two hands interacting with each other in a loving, painful, neutral or rejecting way (Fig. 1A). Emotional interactions of hands involve goal-directed actions, sensations and emotions, and can thereby induce vicarious activations in motor, somatosensory and emotional systems at once (Bastiaansen et al., 2009;Keysers and Gazzola, 2009). Different emotions were tested because psychopathic individuals may not be equally impaired at perceiving all types of emotions (Blair et al., 2002;Kosson et al., 2002;Blair et al., 2004;Marsh et al., 2008). Our main hypothesis was that the psychopathic group would show less vicarious activity than controls for at least one stimulus condition. Because previous studies have shown that performance and brain activity in tasks explicitly requiring social cognition are relatively preserved in psychopathy (Blair et al., 1996;Richell et al., 2003;Dolan and Fullam, 2004;Sommer et al., 2010), whereas abnormalities in automatically orienting to salient information might generate the largest group differences in the absence of instruction to attend to specific, emotionally relevant aspects of the stimuli (Patterson and Newman, 1993;Newman et al., 2010;Moul et al., 2012), we further ventured to hypothesize that explicitly encouraging psychopathic individuals to empathize with the actors on the screen might reduce group differences in vicarious activations.",

A duplicate of every video was left-right mirrored (Adobe Premiere) to ensure that hands entered equally often from both sides. Subjects were instructed to watch the videos as if they were watching one of their favourite videos. They were told that a question would be asked later and that they could answer it if they had watched (not memorized) the videos carefully. Two event-related runs ($8 min) consisted of 36 videos (nine instances of each condition), separated by a fixation cross for 8-12 s (Fig. 1C). Subjects' left eye-gaze was recorded by an infrared camera (SMI, iView; 50 Hz).",

Whenever possible we then used the Anatomy ToolBox (Eickhoff et al., 2007) or the AAL atlas of the WFU Pickatlas (Maldjian et al., 2003) for regions not yet included in the Anatomy ToolBox and then combined them into a single composite anatomical region of interest using a logical 'OR' (Fig. 2, blue transparent regions). These anatomical regions, defined using Anatomy ToolBox included the premotor cortices (Brodmann area 6 in Anatomy ToolBox) (Gazzola and Keysers, 2009;Caspers et al., 2010), the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI = BA3a + b + BA1 + BA2 and SII = OP1 + OP2 + OP3 + OP4) (Keysers et al., 2010). Those defined using the AAL included the insula and the anterior/mid cingulate (Wicker et al., 2003;Singer et al., 2004Singer et al., , 2006Jabbi et al., 2007;Bastiaansen et al., 2009;Lamm et al., 2011). (ii) We used the results from our localizer experiment (i.e. experience) to select voxels that were significantly activated by at least one of our stimuli by either one of the groups (Fig. 2, red transparent regions). Eight one-sample random effect t-tests, comparing the four summary volumes (love, pain, neutral, exclusion) of the controls and those of the patients against zero (P unc 5 0.001), were combined by a logical 'OR' (Marsbar; http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/) to generate a composite functional region of interest. We combined all hand interactions into a single region of interest, because empathic responses in the viewer are not always equal to the emotion in the actor; seeing pain can trigger tender feelings in addition to, or instead of, pain. Using a composite functional region of interest that included voxels triggered by any of the experiences (love, pain, exclusion or neutral), ensured an inclusive analysis that also captured empathic responses that are not equal to the viewed emotions: tender feelings triggered by a pain video would be captured by such a composite functional region of interest, because similar tender feelings will have been triggered by the love interactions also included in the region of interest definition. The same holds for pain triggered by the sight of exclusion etc. (iii) A logical 'AND' was used to combine the composite functional and anatomical regions of interest (Fig. 2, purple transparent regions) leading to our final region of interest.",

We compared these activations with those of ageand IQ-matched healthy controls. During observation, individuals with psychopathy showed, compared to controls, a wide network with reduced activations, including regions of the temporal, insular, parietal and frontal lobe. In addition to agnostically reporting all brain regions showing group differences, we aimed to critically examine if these group differences provide robust evidence for reduced vicarious activations. To do so, we used a dual, conservative approach, in which we excluded visually triggered group differences (i.e. during observation) as evidence of abnormal vicarious activation if they occurred in regions (i) that were not activated by the experience of hand interactions (i.e. during experience); and (ii) that were not consistently associated with vicarious activations in the literature. Doing so, we show that areas associated with vicarious activations to hand actions (premotor cortices), sensations (primary and secondary somatosensory cortices), and emotions (anterior cingulate and insula cortices) were indeed hypo-activated in the psychopathy compared to the control group during observation. However, group differences attributable to vicarious activations were significantly reduced when specifically instructing participants to empathize with the actors in the videos. Despite the fact that the different types of hand actions induced different brain activations during experience and observation, including the expected recruitment of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex for painful and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex for loving interactions (Supplementary material), none of the experiments indicated that the patients were more different from the control subjects for a particular type of hand action. Our study has a number of limitations. First, because there was a security risk considered unacceptable associated with bringing nonpsychopathic incarcerated offenders to our scanning facility, we lack such a control group. Secondary factors linked to criminal lifestyle (e.g. lower level of education, history of drug abuse and length of incarceration) could thus contribute to our group differences. Unfortunately, as these variables were highly correlated with the factor Group [e.g. r(Group, Substance abuse) = 0.86], disentangling their contribution through inclusion of nuisance covariates in our analyses is impossible (Miller and Chapman, 2001). Secondly, although we included one of the largest group of psychopathic offenders ever scanned at 3 T, it is difficult to ascertain that our findings generalize to all incarcerated psychopathic offenders, making a replication study in a different country particularly important. Third, incarcerated psychopaths are a subgroup of psychopaths. It is unclear whether those psychopaths that have never been incarcerated would show the same pattern of brain activity. Analysis is based on raw values. *The insula cluster, 31 voxels that are also significant when restricting the analysis to the region of interest (small volume correction, q 5 0.05 for the entire region of interest).

BA = Brodmann area; Hipp = hippocampus; p. orbitalis = pars hIP1 = Cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of the intraparietal sulcus according to Choi et al., 2006;Scheperjans, 2008a,b; IPC = inferior parietal cortex; PGa., PF., PFm = Cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of the inferior parietal cortex according to Caspers et al., 2006Caspers et al., , 2008; FD., SUB., CA., EC. = Cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of the hippocampus according to Amunts et al., 2005. With these limitations in mind, our results shed new light on the neural basis of psychopathy in two ways. First, they point to reduced vicarious activity in regions involved in performing actions, feeling touch and experiencing emotions, that are considered functional markers of empathy, as a possible neural basis for the reduced empathy and antisocial behaviour, central to psychopathy (Hare et al., 2001;Hare, 2003;Blair et al., 2006;Hare and Neumann, 2009). For most of us, seeing someone get hurt triggers vicarious activity in pain areas. This vicarious pain gives us an 'egoistic' reason to refrain from antisocial behaviour; do not hurt others because it (vicariously) hurts you (Miller and Eisenberg, 1988). In psychopathy, reduced somatosensory, insula and anterior cingulate vicarious activations could disinhibit antisocial behaviour. Because we found these deficits to be independent of video type, they suggest reduced empathy even for the pleasure of others.",

In particular, instructions led to a partial 'normalization' (i.e. significantly reduced quantitative group differences) of brain activity in the insula within our region of interest according to the Experiment \u00c2 Group interaction. Because stimulation of the insula can inhibit aggression in monkeys (Caruana et al., 2011), this instruction-triggered increase of insular activations in psychopathy could have important violence-inhibiting behavioural effects. Future experiments should directly investigate the brain-behaviour link we propose, by creating conditions in which for instance psychopathic and control participants are given a choice to harm a confederate to gain money, while measuring the participants' brain activity. Our data would predict that, particularly in participants with psychopathy, instructions to empathize with the confederate will increase vicarious pain activations in the insula and reduce the propensity to harm the confederate. The effect of instruction is also apparent in the brain activity in the psychopathy group outside the vicarious activation mask, where brain activity changed from never being more active compared to control subjects during the observation experiment (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3, and even when taking only love and pain into account Supplementary Fig. 3), to being more active in half the voxels during the empathy experiment (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Altogether, combining the findings of the observation and empathy experiment, our data suggest a profound reconceptualization of psychopathy more as a reduced propensity, rather than an incapacity, to generate vicarious activations. Indeed, in self-report measures of empathy, our psychopathy group reported normal levels of trait empathy (data not shown) and, after instructions to empathize, to have their own feelings affected as much by the different video types than our control group (Supplementary material), in line with our finding of relatively preserved capacity for empathy, at least under certain instructions.",

            "text": "What mechanisms might mediate this effect of instruction? The interaction analysis revealed that normalization of brain activity in the region of interest following instructions to empathize was accompanied by increases relative to control subjects in regions (outside the region of interest), associated with conscious mentalizing (including the medial prefrontal cortex and the temporal pole) (Amodio and Frith, 2006;Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009), and deliberate reappraisal (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus, Ochsner et al., 2004). A recent functional MRI study in healthy volunteers showed that the anterior insula could be activated through the abovementioned mentalizing and reappraisal circuits while participants deliberately try to imagine what a character in a written story would feel (Jabbi et al., 2008). Taken together, this suggests that under instructions to empathize, our psychopathic participants relied more than our control participants on deliberate mechanisms to boost the activation of their own actions, emotions and sensations. Accordingly, we do not find that the overall brain activity is 'normal' in psychopathic individuals while deliberately empathizing with others, but rather, that they manage to recruit vicarious activations to a similar level. In the context of many residual group differences outside the vicarious activation region of interest, future research will need to use other methods (e.g. physiological recordings-galvanic skin response, pupillary dilation, heart rate, respiration or blood pressure-or qualitative analyses of verbal reports) to further explore how the subjective experience of psychopathic individuals compares with that of controls during deliberate empathy. This is particularly true because many qualitatively different emotions trigger quantitatively similar, overlapping patterns of activation (Jabbi et al., 2007), and quantitatively similar activations in the two groups within the vicarious activation region of interest could thus coexist with qualitative differences in the actual emotions triggered.",

However, in the main effect of Group during observation, we also measured reduced activations in the bilateral amygdala. Because the amygdala is central to learning (Blair, 2007) and attention (Patterson and Newman, 1993;Moul et al., 2012) centred theories of psychopathy, this reduced amygdala activation invites us to consider how our findings relate to these dominant theories of psychopathy. Our hypo-vicarious view of psychopathy integrates well with models of moral development emphasizing deficits in learning, where the amygdala of children normally helps them associate their instrumental aggressive behaviour, which is originally neutral, with negative emotions triggered by the distress of their victims (Blair, 2007). This is because our reduced spontaneous vicarious activations (within our region of interest) could lead to reduced personal distress while harming others and our reduced bilateral amygdala activity (outside the region of interest) may then lead to reduced associations between aggression and the (reduced) personal distress in psychopathic individuals. Our hypo-vicarious view of psychopathy, however, also overlaps with attention-based theories. As the amygdala is increasingly conceived as an automatic detector of salient features in the environment (Adolphs, 2010), our finding that deliberate attention can reduce vicarious activation deficits in psychopathy dovetails with theories of psychopathy emphasizing abnormal amygdale-based attention (Moul et al., 2012), by suggesting that reduced empathy is a downstream result of impaired stimulus driven, bottom-up attention to the emotions of others, which can under certain conditions (here through instructions) be compensated by deliberate, bottom-up attention. Hence, our work on vicarious activations is no alternative to work on instrumental learning or attention. Instead it complements these efforts by adding a third protagonist, vicarious activations, to a complex scenario in which abnormal bottom-up attention might fail to trigger normal empathy, which in turn prevents the instrumental learning so central to moral development. In this scenario, deliberate, top-down modulation of attention may restore vicarious activations. Understanding how the amygdala mechanistically interacts with regions involved in vicarious activations to direct this scenario remains to be understood.",

Only if empathy is a spontaneous response, will you feel empathy in this circumstance, and reduce your violence (Miller and Eisenberg, 1988). Accordingly, the lack of spontaneous vicarious activation we measured in our observation experiment will have severe violencedisinhibiting consequences even in the face of a preserved deliberate empathy. For therapists requesting a scientific understanding of psychopathy to tailor their therapies (Salekin et al., 2010), our finding that instructions to empathize can reduce group differences indicates that therapeutic efforts may actually not need to create a capacity for empathy, for such a capacity may already exist (at least in our sample of incarcerated psychopathic offenders). Instead, therapies may need to focus on making the existing capacity more automatic, so that it will come into play even when inhibiting goal-directed behaviour. Such therapies could harvest the patients' potential to normalize vicarious activations through deliberately focusing attention on empathizing with others. The fact that psychopathic individuals often display low motivation for change and comply less with therapy than other criminals (Salekin et al., 2010) will certainly represent an unfortunate challenge in such efforts.",
