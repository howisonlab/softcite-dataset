We compared outgrowth efficiency and in vitro and in vivo functionality of BOECs derived from ICMP with BOECs from age-matched (ACON) and healthy young (CON) controls. Methods and Results-We isolated 3.6AE0.6 BOEC colonies/100910 6 mononuclear cells (MNCs) from 60-mL blood samples of ICMP patients (n=45; age: 66AE1 years; LVEF: 31AE2%) versus 3.5AE0.9 colonies/100910 6 MNCs in ACON (n=32; age: 60AE1 years) and 2.6AE0.4 colonies/100910 6 MNCs in CON (n=55; age: 34AE1 years), P=0.29. Endothelial lineage (VEGFR2 + / CD31 + /CD146 +) and progenitor (CD34 + /CD133 \u00c0) marker expression was comparable in ICMP and CON. Growth kinetics were similar between groups (P=0.38) and not affected by left ventricular systolic dysfunction, maladaptive remodeling, or presence of cardiovascular risk factors in ICMP patients. In vitro neovascularization potential, assessed by network remodeling on Matrigel and three-dimensional spheroid sprouting, did not differ in ICMP from (A)CON. Secretome analysis showed a marked proangiogenic profile, with highest release of angiopoietin-2 (1.4AE0.3910 5 pg/10 6 ICMP-BOECs) and placental growth factor (5.8AE1.5910 3 pg/10 6 ICMP BOECs), independent of age or ischemic disease. Senescence-associated b-galactosidase staining showed comparable senescence in BOECs from ICMP (5.8AE2.1%; n=17), ACON (3.9AE1.1%; n=7), and CON (9.0AE2.8%; n=13), P=0.19. High-resolution microcomputed tomography analysis in the ischemic hindlimb of nude mice confirmed increased arteriogenesis in the thigh region after intramuscular injections of BOECs from ICMP (P=0.025; n=8) and CON (P=0.048; n=5) over vehicle control (n=8), both to a similar extent (P=0.831). Conclusions-BOECs can be successfully culture-expanded from patients with ICMP. In contrast to impaired functionality of ICMPderived bone marrow MNCs, BOECs retain a robust proangiogenic profile, both in vitro and in vivo, with therapeutic potential for targeting ischemic disease.",

Mice were stored on ice overnight to solidify the gelatin and fix the contrast agent in the vessels. The hind limbs were scanned with a high-resolution microCT (50 kV, 200 lA, 10 W; SkyScan-1172; SkyScan, Virginia Beach, VA) at a pixel size of 8 lm, providing highly detailed, quantitative 3D structural data of the perfused \"vessel tree\" of the complete limb. The individual twodimensional (2D) images were reconstructed into a 3D data set with isotropic voxel size of 8 lm using the manufacturer's dedicated software (NRecon; SkyScan). Analysis was performed using in-house developed custom-made software (MeVisLab based; MeVis Medical Solutions AG, Bremen, Germany) after an additional downsampling step by a factor of 4, for reasons of computational feasibility. The 3D vessel tree was automatically segmented for semiautomatic quantification. Data in the ligated leg were analyzed versus the nonligated control leg.",

No detectable distribution was observed in lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, and heart. Doppler flow index at inclusion (5 days after hindlimb ischemia surgery) was similar in all groups (vehicle control: 35.9AE1.5; CON-BOECs: 35.5AE1.8; ICMP-BOECs: 35.9AE2.0; P=0.98). High-resolution angio microCT of the upper leg confirmed enhanced BOEC-mediated arteriogenesis in comparison to vehicle control, 21 days after surgery (Figure 9). Although total vessel length and the number of vessel branch points tended to be increased after BOEC delivery from both CON and ICMP ( Figure 9B), therapeutic effects were confined to smaller arterioles with a diameter ranging from 32 to 64 lm ( Figure 9D), corresponding to collateral arteries, as documented by Scholz and Schaper. 17,18 Importantly, increased arteriogenesis was observed after transplantation of BOECs from healthy young controls (P=0.048) and ICMP patients (P=0.025) over vehicle control, both to a similar extent (P=0.831). Clinically, BOECs were able to prevent additional amputations after cell delivery (5 days after hindlimb ischemia surgery). A total of 3 of 14 animals suffered from additional amputations after injections of vehicle control versus none in the BOEC-injected groups.",

In our patient population with stable ischemic heart failure, optimally treated according to current guidelines, a similar number of BOEC colonies were obtained in patients and healthy controls.

Ingram et al. reported that BOECs contain a complete hierarchy of low-and high-proliferation potential cells, analogous to the hematopoietic cell system. 27 Moreover, long-term culture conditions may erase the functional \"fingerprint\" of various microenvironmental factors, present in the donor milieu. Cell types with a previously documented dysfunctional phenotype in an older patient population with ischemic heart disease were only exposed to short-term in vitro cell culture (eg, circulating angiogenic cells and colony-forming-unit EPCs) or no in vitro environment at all (eg, CD133 + /VEGFR2 + circulating EPCs and bone-marrow-derived MNCs). Hence, \"weaning off\" donor microenvironmental influences and positive selection based on proliferation potential were only minimally or not present. Specific reports on BOEC functionality and proliferation potential in various other disease states are, however, not uniform. Functional impairment has been reported, related to age, 28 type 2 diabetes, 29 obesity, 30 pulmonary arterial hypertension, 31 and smoking/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 32 On the other hand, previous reports in treated coronary artery disease 26,33,34 and arterial hypertension 35 documented similar BOEC functionality in comparison to healthy controls. Moreover, improved BOEC functionality has been demonstrated in neovascular age-related macular degeneration, 24 ischemic stroke, 22 and extensive burns. 25,26,[33][34][35] In comparison to healthy controls, our findings did not demonstrate differences in BOEC functionality and proliferation potential in a patient population with severe, but stable, ischemic heart failure.

            "text": "We studied in vivo cell-mediated neovascularization potential using high-resolution angio microCT because of its ability to quantitatively assess the complete \"vessel tree\" in 3D. Histology is mainly restricted to evaluating vascular density in a limited 2D area of view, whereas laser Doppler flowmetry is only reporting superficial blood flow (200-300 lm penetration depth), classically in the foot region. 36 Collateral vascular remodeling (arteriogenesis) has been postulated as the most important mechanism to compensate for bulk perfusion loss. Efficient collateral formation is a critical determinant of tissue vulnerability and preservation during ischemia. Occlusion of the femoral artery in a hindlimb ischemia model results in development of collateral vessels in the upper leg, relatively close to the site of occlusion. In contrast, ischemia and angiogenesis occur in the lower leg and foot. 37 We consequently focused on the thigh region as the readout for collateral vascular remodeling, and observed that cells from both patients and controls support the arteriogenesis process to a similar extent, especially at the level of arterioles (32-64 lm in diameter). Extensive (ultra)structural histological analysis by Scholz and Schaper in murine hindlimbs previously identified collateral arteries in the 40-to 70-lm diameter range. 17,18 We documented a significant BOEC-mediated increase in vascular length within this specific size range. A trend toward a BOEC-mediated increase of vessel length and number of branch points of the complete vessel tree in the thigh region of the ligated leg was noted. These results did, however, not reach statistical significance, given that the therapeutic effects were confined to one specific size range (arterioles 32-64 lm in diameter). Arteriogenesis relies on a complex interplay of many growth factors, of which ANG-2, PLGF, FGF, and PDGF-BB were all demonstrated to be secreted by BOECs. [37][38][39][40] Acute retention studies documented BOECs, mainly clustered within the perimuscular compartment 24 hours after intramuscular injection. At 21 days, we noted disappearance of the BOEC clusters in the perimuscular compartment and appearance of isolated BOECs in the vascular compartment. We observed only limited incorporation/ engraftment of BOECs into functional blood vessels after intramuscular delivery of 250 000 cells per mouse, suggesting a concomitant paracrine contribution of the transplanted cell population to their neovascularization potential. These findings indicate migration toward and engraftment within the vascular compartment to perform their biological effects, \"sustained\" release of a proangiogenic/-arteriogenic growth factor \"cocktail\" with or without incorporation into functional vessels. ANG-2 and PLGF were found to be the most abundantly secreted angiogenic growth factors, independent of underlying ischemic disease. Both ANG-2 and PLGF play an important role in the complex cytokine cocktail, mediating the overall neovascularization process in ischemic disease. [37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47] In conclusion, we report that BOECs can be isolated and culture-expanded from patients with severe, but stable, ICMP and offer an easily accessible, clonally expandable cell source with profound neovascularization potential. In contrast to impaired functionality of other progenitor cell types derived from patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, BOECs retain a robust proangiogenic profile in vitro and in vivo and hold promise for autologous cell therapy in severe or refractory ischemic heart disease.",
