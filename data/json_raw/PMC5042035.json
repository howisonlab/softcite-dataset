This is done in order to reveal the possible application of this system for detection and pathophysiological research of SARA by continuous ruminal pH measurement. The possibility of using this system for assessment of the ruminal pH in SARA cattle, and the presence of negative correlation between the ruminal pH and ruminal temperature in heathy and SARA cattle were determined. In addition, the 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analysis showed that the ruminal microbial community was simpler in SARA cattle, and the bacterial numbers in SARA cattle were lower than those in healthy hay-fed cattle. Concentrate feeding might have reduced the diversity of the ruminal microbial community. Changes in the ruminal microbial community of SARA cattle might be related to the changes in ruminal pH followed by the decrease in the number of some bacteria. Continuous monitoring of the ruminal pH using the radio-transmission pH-measurement system would be applied for detection and prevention of SARA in the field and pathophysiological research of SARA, including ruminal zymology and bacteriology, which have been determined previously by sampling of the ruminal fluid and measuring of ruminal pH.",

Furthermore, SARA is associated with immunosuppression (Kleen et al. 2003) and inflammation (Khafipour et al. 2009a(Khafipour et al. ,2009bPlaizier et al. 2009). Free lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases in the rumen during SARA (Gozho et al. 2007;Emmanuel et al. 2008), and the LPS translocates from the rumen into blood circulation, which activates an inflammatory response (Khafipour et al. 2009a(Khafipour et al. ,2009b affecting peripheral leukocyte populations and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, monitoring ruminal pH and prevention of acidic pH are very important challenges in the dairy industry.",

In order to obtain the ruminal fluid for pH measurement, oro-ruminal probe and rumenocentesis are used (Duffield et al. 2004;Bramley et al. 2008). Recently, an indwelling ruminal pH system was developed and placed in the rumen of fistulated cattle (Marden et al. 2005;AlZahal et al. 2007;Penner et al. 2006Penner et al. , 2009. Although an indwelling ruminal pH system has made continuous recording of ruminal pH possible (Keunen et al. 2002;Nocek et al. 2002aNocek et al. ,2002bRustome et al. 2006), this system can be used only for experimentally fistulated cows. Therefore, this system does not allow the field application of SARA evaluation. Based on these backgrounds, we recently have invented a new radio-transmission pH-measurement system, and assessed its performance and usefulness in a continuous evaluation of ruminal pH (Sato et al. 2012a, b).",

However, changes in the ruminal pH and volatile fatty acid (VFA) of cattle with repeated acidosis challenges are not adequately known. Furthermore, several studies have been conducted on the rumen microbial community in cows with SARA (Chen et al. 2012;Hernandez-Sanabria et al. 2012;Mao et al. 2013;Golder et al. 2014). The most common bacteria detected in the rumen of cattle with SARA are Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus bovis (Nagaraja & Titgemeyer 2007). The dominant bacterial phyla include Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and all subgroups of Proteobacteria. Recently, pyrosequencing has been used for assessment of microbial composition in the rumen of cattle (Jami & Mizrahi 2012;Rice et al. 2012). These studies supported the notion that pyrosequencing facilitated greater understanding of microbial diversity. Most of the studies about microbial communities in SARA cattle are based on single induction of SARA. The microbial community in cattle with repeated induction of SARA is unknown.",

            "text": "The radio-transmission pH-measurement system consists of a wireless pH sensor, a data measurement receiver, a relay unit and a personal computer with special software (YCOW-S; DKK-Toa Yamagata) (Sato et al. 2012b) installed. The wireless system utilized a specified low-power radio transmission system (429 MHz band), which could be operated without a license in accordance with Japanese Radio Law. The mean variations of the measurements by the glass pH electrode were + 0.20 after 2 months of continuous recording, compared to the values confirmed by a standard pH solution at the start of the recording. The mean lifetime of the internal battery was 3 months when measurements were continuously transmitted every 10 min. There was a good correlation between continuous recording and spot sampling (r = 0.986, P < 0.01), when the ruminal pH recorded by our new system was compared to that of the spot sampling of ruminal fluid (Sato et al. 2012b). We have demonstrated the possible application of the radio-transmission pH-measurement system for assessment and monitoring of the ruminal pH in cows. Our new system might contribute to accurate assessment and prevention of SARA. In this chapter, our experimental results of basic tests for performance of radiotransmission pH-measurement system are described.",

In cattle fed the C-diet, the bottom-rumen and reticular pH reverted to the basal level by the next morning, while the middlerumen pH did not recover completely, suggesting that active fermentation occurred in the middle of the rumen. The mean pH at 1-h intervals was higher in the reticulum than at the bottom and in the middle of the rumen. The relatively stable reticular pH may result from dilution due to salivation and drinking water, as previously described (Dado & Allen 1993). In cows fed the RAI-diet, the bottom-rumen pH fell to approximately 5.2 after the evening feeding, but returned to the basal level by the next morning. In contrast, the middle-rumen pH did not return to the basal level (6.5) within 24 h, presumably owing to continuous and vigorous fermentation. Significant (P < 0.01) positive correlations were observed in the pH of cattle fed the RAI-diet between in the middle and at the bottom of the rumen (r = 0.894), in the middle of the rumen and in the reticulum (r = 0.764) and at the bottom of the rumen and in the reticulum (r = 0.797).

In an experiment of successive SARA induction, decreased ruminal pH was much severer in the day of challenge feeding (Dohme et al. 2008). Increased severity of SARA might have been induced by instability of the ruminal microflora (Nagaraja & Titgemeyer 2007), and decreased absorptive capacity of the ruminal epithelium might also have contributed to VFA accumulation in the rumen. A short-term, severe insult of acute acidosis decreased ruminal VFA absorption, presumably caused by damage to the ruminal wall (Krehbiel et al. 1995). Decreased ruminal absorptive capacity as a result of acidosis challenge may increase the severity of subsequent acidosis challenges. However, changes in the ruminal pH and VFA of cattle with repeated acidosis challenges are unknown. In addition, molecular techniques have shown that the ruminal microbial community is highly diverse (Mao et al. 2013), but the factors influencing its composition remain unknown. The ruminal microbial community in SARA cows has been reported (Chen et al. 2012;Hernandez-Sanabria et al. 2012;Golder et al. 2014), but the relationship between the ruminal pH, VFA and microbiota composition in SARA cattle is unclear.",

Concentrate feeding might have reduced the diversity of the rumen microbial community. Changes in the rumen microbial  composition of SARA cattle might be related to the marked changes in ruminal pH followed by the rapid decrease in numbers of bacteria. Changes in ruminal pH and rumen microbial community were observed markedly by acute and short-term change in feeding, which indicated ruminal adaptation (Mao et al. 2013). However, further research is needed to reveal the relation between ruminal pH and microbial community.",

The effects of propionibacteria feeding on the lactational performance of dairy cows in early lactation have been reported (Stein et al. 2006;Lehloenya et al. 2008;Weiss et al. 2008), and the cattle that received probiotics containing lactate-utilizing Propionibacterium had higher ruminal concentrations of acetate (Ghorbani et al. 2002). However, little information is available regarding the effect of probiotics containing Propionibacterium on the ruminal pH and VFA in cattle.
