The resulting uncertainty in risk assessment leads to significant overtreatment, with associated costs and morbidity. We developed a performance-based strategy to identify protein biomarkers predictive of prostate cancer aggressiveness and lethality regardless of biopsy-sampling variation. Methods: Prostatectomy samples from a large patient cohort with long follow-up were blindly assessed by expert pathologists who identified the tissue regions with the highest and lowest Gleason grade from each patient. To simulate biopsy-sampling error, a core from a high-and a low-Gleason area from each patient sample was used to generate a 'high' and a 'low' tumour microarray, respectively. Results: Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we identified from 160 candidates 12 biomarkers that predicted prostate cancer aggressiveness (surgical Gleason and TNM stage) and lethal outcome robustly in both high-and low-Gleason areas. Conversely, a previously reported lethal outcome-predictive marker signature for prostatectomy tissue was unable to perform under circumstances of maximal sampling error. Conclusions: Our results have important implications for cancer biomarker discovery in general and development of a sampling error-resistant clinical biopsy test for prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness.",

The American Cancer Society estimates that, nationally, 233 000 new diagnoses of prostate cancer will be made in 2014 (Siegel et al, 2014). Of all men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, only about one in seven will progress to metastatic disease over a lifetime, whereas approximately half of them will have localised disease that has a very low risk of progression (Carter et al, 2012;Siegel et al, 2014). Despite this low risk, as many as 90% of these low-risk prostate cancer patients in the United States undergo radical treatment, usually radical prostatectomy (RP) or ablative radiation therapy (Cooperberg et al, 2010). Such treatments for low-risk patients may be excessive and often result in long-term adverse events, including urinary incontinence and erectile and bowel dysfunction (Wilt et al, 2008;Moyer and U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, 2012;Loeb et al, 2014).",

Pathological evaluation of tissue obtained by needle biopsy is essential both to confirm a prostate cancer diagnosis and to grade the cancer. Tumour grade, as determined by the biopsy Gleason score (GS) is the most important predictor of outcome, and considered the most informative parameter for guiding management decisions. The GS is comprised of two Gleason patterns, with the more prevalent pattern specified first. The two are summed to determine the GS. According to a 2005 consensus on Gleason scoring, only three patterns (3, 4, and 5) are typically recognised on biopsy (Epstein et al, 2005). The accepted prognostic categories of GS are 3 \u00fe 3 \u00bc 6, 3 \u00fe 4 \u00bc 7, 4 \u00fe 3 \u00bc 7, 8, and 9-10. Importantly, although 3 \u00fe 4 \u00bc 7 and 4\u00fe 3 \u00bc 7 have equivalent Gleason sums, the latter has significantly worse prognosis based on a higher amount of pattern 4 (Goodman et al, 2012;Reese et al, 2012). Approximately 80-85% of all prostate cancer biopsies have a GS of 3 \u00fe 3 \u00bc 6 or 3 \u00fe 4 \u00bc 7, representing a spectrum of cases with low to intermediate to high risk of progression (Epstein et al, 2012). Patients deemed to have indolent disease are candidates for active surveillance (AS) (Mohler et al, 2012;NCCN, 2012a;NCCN, 2012b). However, current methods of biopsy evaluation are often unable to place individual patients accurately along this spectrum (Cooperberg et al, 2010;Epstein et al, 2012).",

Despite the current standard practice of multicore biopsy sampling, the most aggressive area of the tumour is frequently under-represented or over-represented (Corcoran et al, 2012;Bjurlin and Taneja, 2014). Indeed, 25-50% of cases of prostate cancer need to be either upgraded or downgraded from their initial biopsy score to a more accurate surgical GS after analysis and grading of prostatectomy tissue (Kvale et al, 2009;Davies et al, 2011;Epstein et al, 2012). Discordance between pathologists in Gleason grading can be as high as 30%, adding significantly to the difficulty of ensuring uniform and accurate prognostication (McKenney et al, 2011;Goodman et al, 2012).",

            "text": "Prior studies have demonstrated that RP GS of seven or higher and extension of prostate cancer beyond the prostate gland are significant predictors of metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality (Ross et al, 2012;Shikanov and Eggener, 2012;Brimo et al, 2013). Accordingly, we defined 'aggressive disease' based on the prostate pathology as surgical GS of at least 3 \u00fe 4 or pT3b (seminal vesicle invasion), N \u00fe , or M \u00fe . We tested the fourbiomarker model (SMAD4, CCND1, SPP1, and PTEN) previously reported by Ding et al (2011) for its ability to predict both diseasespecific death and disease aggressiveness in our sampling variation TMA cohort. Using logistic regression analysis on the patient cores in the L and H TMAs, marker coefficients and AUC were estimated on the testing set. As shown in Table 2, when measured on H TMA patient cores, the four-marker signature was able to predict disease-specific death with a median test AUC of 0.65 (95% CI of 0.59-0.74). However, when measured on L TMA, representing biased underestimation of the surgical GS, the four-marker model showed a non-significant median test AUC of 0.49 (95% CI of 0.42-0.58). Moreover, the four-marker signature was unable to predict aggressive disease in either H or L TMA (median test AUC of 0.56 (95% CI of 0.44-0.64) and of 0.56 (95% CI of 0.46-0.65), respectively). These results demonstrate the impact of sampling error on prognostic marker performance, and support the necessity of identifying alternative biomarker combinations that can predict outcomes accurately regardless of sampling variation.",

Markers shown in red text demonstrated predictive value (Po0.1) for aggressive disease or death from prostate cancer based on either an increased or decreased expression in both low-and high-Gleason areas. This result suggests that these markers are resistant to varying degrees of sampling error. There were two markers that were predictive of aggressiveness and three markers of lethal outcome when measured in high, but not in low-Gleason areas, indicating that these markers are not robust to sampling error. Conversely, no markers were identified that had predictive performance only in low, but not in high-Gleason areas. Interestingly, out of the 14 markers with significant univariate performance for aggressiveness, 12 markers also exhibited significant univariate performance for lethal outcome, consistent with a strong correlation between aggressive disease and lethal outcome. Our performance-based biomarker selection approach also confirmed correlation between lethal outcome and expression of three known prostate cancer progression markers, EZH2, HoxB13, and MTDH2, as previously reported (Hu et al, 2009;Yang and Yu, 2013;Mills, 2014).",

In this manuscript, we describe the successful development of a performance-based strategy to identify and evaluate biomarkers predictive of prostate cancer aggressiveness and lethal outcome, even under circumstances of extreme sampling variation, an issue typically encountered during prostate biopsy taking. Using a large cohort (N \u00bc 380) of annotated clinical prostatectomy samples with long-term follow-up, the areas of highest and lowest GS on each prostatectomy tissue were cored to generate paired TMAs (H and L TMAs) representing the entire cohort, thereby simulating biopsies with sampling error for each patient. Using these paired TMAs, we evaluated a large number of biomarker candidates for the ability to predict aggressive prostate pathology and lethal outcome when measured in either low-or high-grade cancer regions from each patient. We first selected biomarkers with performance against aggressiveness and lethal outcome when measured in L TMA tissue, to identify those most robust to extreme sampling error. For this purpose, we only included L TMA samples with core Gleason p3 \u00fe 4 as clinically relevant, as biopsies with GS 4 \u00fe 3 or higher inevitably will be aggressive therapy candidates. Most of the identified biomarkers from univariate analyses were predictive of both disease aggressiveness and prostate cancer-specific mortality regardless of whether they were measured in L or H TMA tissue samples, and hence robust to sampling variation (Figure 3). Moreover, performance of some wellestablished prostate cancer biomarkers predictive of progression risk and lethal outcome (SMAD4, EZH2, MTDH2, HoxB13, and PTEN) corroborated the validity of the approach. As part of specificity validation of our antibodies, we learned through target knockdown analyses and mass spectrometry-based protein sequencing analysis that a MAb sold as anti-DCC actually recognised the unrelated protein HSPA9, or Mortalin. We found that HSPA9 was predictive as part of multivariate models and hence was included in the final 12-marker set. Our functional analyses revealed the involvement of HSPA9 in clonogenic colony formation and cell proliferation, consistent with previously reported data (see Supplementary Figure 2 and Flachbartova and Kovacech, 2013). This further validates our unbiased, performance-based marker selection approach.",

A multivariate model based on these 12 markers showed similar predictive performance for aggressiveness across tissue-sampling variation ( Figure 5C). Interestingly, the risk scores generated based on the 12-marker aggressiveness model were equally predictive for the separate end point of lethal outcome across tissue-sampling variation ( Figure 5C). This indicates a clear linkage between aggressive features on surgical pathology and lethality, and, importantly, validates the usage of our pathologic end point for building our biomarker panel as relevant for long-term patient outcome. We conclude that the 12 identified biomarkers are relevant for prediction of tumour behaviour and could serve as the starting point for development of a clinical, evidence-based multivariate biopsy test for evaluating prostate cancer aggressiveness as a critical aid in early decision-making steps in patient management (NCCN, 2012a;NCCN, 2012b).",

One of the key reasons for biopsy-sampling error is the heterogeneity of prostate cancer. The inability to consistently acquire tissue from the most aggressive parts of the tumour leads to frequent underestimation of tumour aggressiveness and progression risk. By coring into the highest and lowest Gleason area from each patient, we generated paired TMAs of the entire cohort study designed to simulate two biopsies from each patient, one with 'maximal' sampling error (L TMA), and the other with minimal sampling error (H TMA). We focused on L TMAs with core Gleason p3 \u00fe 4, as these represent the clinically relevant cases where standard of care is insufficient for accurate prognosis. We found that B54% of these L TMA cases were upgraded to a higher surgical GS, which is higher than observed in clinical practice (Porten et al, 2011), confirming that our approach provided a biased sampling error model.",

Although we confirmed that the model was predictive for lethal outcome in H TMA, representing a situation of minimal sampling error, the model was not lethal outcome-predictive at all in our L TMA tissue cores, representing maximal sampling error (Table 2).

Most of these univariately selected markers were predictive of both indications across sampling variation, supporting a correlation between disease aggressiveness and lethal outcome. Interestingly, although all markers that showed univariate performance for both indications on L TMA also were predictive on H TMA, two markers (PXN and MTDH2) and three markers (NCOA2, CCND1 (Cyclin D1), and AKAP8) (Sattler et al, 2000;Xu and Li, 2003;Hu et al, 2009;Ding et al, 2011;Canton and Scott, 2013) were predictive of aggressive disease and lethal outcome, respectively, only when measured on H TMA, but not on L TMA (Figure 3). This suggests that these markers are predictive primarily in situations of minimal sampling error. Indeed, all these five markers have been shown as important regulators of cellular proliferation, migration, and oncogenesis (see e.g., Sattler et al, 2000;Xu and Li, 2003;Hu et al, 2009;Ding et al, 2011;Canton and Scott, 2013). The observation that Cyclin D1 is predictive of lethal outcome only in H TMA, but not L TMA, is consistent with the finding that the four-marker signature reported by Ding et al (2011) was not predictive of lethal outcome in our L TMA tissue, as well as on low-grade prostate cancer samples (Irshad et al, 2013). The fact that no markers were predictive for aggressive disease or lethal outcome on only L TMA, but not H TMA, is interesting given that we primarily selected for markers that can predict either aggressiveness or lethal outcome in L TMA, to reflect maximal sampling error robustness. This suggests that the identified markers likely reflect field effects from more aggressive tumour regions, consistent with their similar performance in L and H TMA tissue samples.",

However, there are conflicting results regarding the reliability of many such markers in disease prognosis. For example, although TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions are reported to be associated with high-risk tumours, more recent studies with large cohorts report no strong correlation between these fusions and patient outcome (Gopalan et al, 2009). A multivariate gene expression-based test has recently been reported to predict metastatic disease and lethal outcome based on a conservatively managed cohort of patients from the United Kingdom (Cuzick et al, 2012), as well as biochemical recurrence after treatment in actively managed cohorts in the United States (Cooperberg et al, 2013;Bishoff et al, 2014).

The rationale for this idea is two-fold. First, because prostate cancer is a heterogeneous, multifocal disease, biopsies frequently contain only lower-grade components, and pathologists may classify them as low-risk cancers. However, higher-grade molecular features, not reflected morphologically, have been reported to extend throughout the cancer (Boyd et al, 2012;Sowalsky et al, 2013), and therefore are measurable in seemingly lower-grade-containing biopsies. It is possible to accurately and sensitively assess such high-grade molecular features in situ from tumour regions using a proteomic approach, even in tissue samples with variable amounts of tumour and benign components. This is an advantage over gene expression-based technologies requiring tissue homogenisation, resulting in variable dilution of the highergrade molecular features depending on the amount of intermixed benign tissue. Second, Gleason grading on biopsy is subjective, with expert pathologists disagreeing on up to 30% of cases (McKenney et al, 2011;Goodman et al, 2012). Molecular features that can be objectively measured should improve risk classification.",

The fact that the biomarkers were analysed in multiple ways for univariate and multivariate performance on a single, large cohort increases the potential risk that the results are over-fitted to patients included in this study. Also, we simulated prostate cancer biopsies by taking 1-mm diameter cores from prostate tissue blocks to generate TMA blocks. Protein measurements made from cross-sections of these cores may perform differently if measured in 20 \u00c2 1-mm biopsy sections, as typically encountered in routine pathology practice.",

Further investigation of the 12 biomarkers identified in this study will enable development of an objective clinical biopsy test based on multiplex proteomics in situ imaging. The next step is to identify the optimal biomarker subset algorithm from these 12 biomarkers, and to validate this in a large clinical cohort of Gleason-and TNM-annotated biopsy samples with matched prostatectomy and pathological specimens. These studies are currently under way.",
