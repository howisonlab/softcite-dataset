            "text": "Background: Older women have lower breast cancer surgery rates than younger women. UK policy states that differences in cancer treatment by age can only be justified by patient choice or poor health. Methods: We investigate whether lack of surgery for older patients is explained by patient choice/poor health in a prospective cohort study of 800 women aged X70 years diagnosed with operable (stage 1-3a) breast cancer at 22 English breast cancer units in 2010-2013. Data collection: interviews and case note review. Outcome measure: surgery for operable (stage 1-3a) breast cancer o90 days of diagnosis. Logistic regression adjusts for age, health measures, tumour characteristics, socio-demographics and patient's/surgeon's perceived responsibility for treatment decisions. Results: In the univariable analyses, increasing age predicts not undergoing surgery from the age of 75 years, compared with 70-74-year-olds. Adjusting for health measures and choice, only women aged X85 years have reduced odds of surgery (OR 0.18, 95% CI: 0.07-0.44). Each point increase in Activities of Daily Living score (worsening functional status) reduced the odds of surgery by over a fifth (OR 0.23, 95% CI: 0.15-0.35). Patient's role in the treatment decisions made no difference to whether they received surgery or not; those who were active/collaborative were as likely to get surgery as those who were passive, that is, left the decision up to the surgeon. Conclusion: Lower surgery rates, among older women with breast cancer, are unlikely to be due to patients actively opting out of having this treatment. However, poorer health explains the difference in surgery between 75-84-year-olds and younger women. Lack of surgery for women aged X85 years persists even when health and patient choice are adjusted for. Older women experience higher incidence and worse survival for breast cancer compared with younger women. Incidence doubles from 202 out of 100 000 for women aged 45-49 to 409 out of 100 000 for those aged X85 years (England 2009) (ONS, Office of National Statistics, 2011). Relative five year breast cancer survival decreases with age from 89% for 40-49-year-olds to 69% for women aged X80 years, a drop not seen in the United States and Western European countries (Coleman et al, 2011; Cancer Research UK, 2012). The King's Fund indicates that improved management of older cancer patients could increase cancer survival in England (Foot and Harrison, 2011), and it has been estimated that more than 14 000 cancer deaths could be avoided each year in",

Older women are less likely to be managed in line with the treatment guidelines. Specifically, they are less likely to undergo primary surgery and are also less likely to have follow-up adjuvant treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Wyld et al, 2004;Giordano et al, 2005;Naeim et al, 2006;Lavelle et al, 2007b).

Patients aged X80 years, attending breast cancer units in Greater Manchester between 2002-2003, had 44 times the odds of not receiving surgery for operable breast cancer compared with patients aged 65-79 years, controlling for co-morbidity and functional status (Lavelle et al, 2007a). Several national policies, guidelines (DH, Department of Health, 2000 and initiatives (MacMillan Cancer Support, Age UK and the Department of Health, 2012) have specifically addressed the issue of access to treatment for older cancer patients. This may well have increased surgical rates among older cancer patients over the last decade. Using routine registration data we recently investigated over 23 000 women aged X65 years, registered with breast cancer in Northern Yorkshire and West Midlands, and showed surgery rates rose from 67. 4% in 1997-1999 to 75.1% in 2003-2005  (Lavelle et al, 2012). After adjustment for co-morbidity, older age still predicted lack of surgery. Compared with 65-69-year-olds, the odds of surgery decreased from 0.74 (95% CI: 0.66-0.83) for 70-74-year-olds to 0.13 (95% CI: 0.11-0.14) for women aged X85 years. However, comorbidity is likely to be underestimated as the routine data sources are limited to inpatient stays only. Moreover, no data on wider measures of health such as patient frailty or functional status are routinely collected in the UK, so could not be included. Functional status has been shown to vary independently from co-morbidity (Extermann et al, 1998) and has been found to account for some of the difference in surgical treatment between younger and older breast cancer patients (Lavelle et al, 2007a).",

            "text": "One explanation for differences in the treatment is that older women may choose non-standard treatment (e.g., decline surgery). No measure of patient choice was adjusted for in these previous UK studies. Tang et al (2011) found that of women aged X70 years, diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in Nottingham (England), who were offered a choice between surgery or treatment with hormone therapy, 58.9% did not have surgery. However, no adjustment was made for age and health in multivariable analysis. The residual variation in access to surgery, not explained by choice and health, could therefore not be estimated. Taking account of patient preference in multivariate models has been attempted in two US studies (Silliman et al, 1997;Mandelblatt et al, 2000). Both adjusted for physical health status as measured by the Short Form-36 (Ware et al, 2002) and whether treatment options had been offered/discussed. However, older age remained the strongest predictor of not receiving standard treatment, after adjusting for these measures of patient health and choice. The generalisability of these results to the UK is limited by differences between the health care systems and survival rates (Coleman et al, 2008). Moreover, even when a treatment choice is offered, the patient could defer to the doctor's advice. There is evidence that older women with breast cancer prefer (and are more likely) to do this (Degner et al, 1997), suggesting that non-standard management of older women is more likely to be the result of the doctor's rather than the patient's decision. This needs to be tested in a study in which perceptions of responsibility for the treatment decision for non-standard management are also measured and adjusted for.",

Reflecting WHO's definition of health as 'a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity' (WHO, 1948), a range of health measures, representing patient's functional/health status and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in addition to comorbidity and other clinical measures, were considered. Measures have primarily been selected based on ease of administration, validity, reliability, acceptability to older people (Sturgis et al, 2001;Haywood et al, 2004), and prediction of non-standard management (Lavelle et al, 2007a) and/or treatment outcomes (Audisio et al, 2005). Measures include: Elderly Population Health Status Survey's (ELPHS) ADL (Sharples et al, 2000) functional status measure, Short Form-12 (SF-12) (Ware et al, 2002) health status measure, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer EORTC-C30 measure of HRQoL (Osoba et al, 1997), Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group-Performance Status (Oken et al, 1982), 6 item Cognitive Impairment Test (6CIT) (Brooke and Bullock, 1999), smoking status, body mass index (Bertin et al, 1998;Sorensen et al, 2002) and Charlson Index of Co-morbidity (Charlson et al, 1987).",

The Control Preferences Scale (CPS) has a component Perception Scale (Degner et al, 1997;Janz et al, 2004), which we used to examine the extent to which older patients were given and made the choice of whether or not to have surgery from the perspective of both the patients and their surgeons. The CPS Perception Scale measures perceptions of responsibility for the treatment decision (see Table 1), presenting the patient/surgeon with five corresponding response alternatives along a continuum, from the patient to the doctor solely making the treatment decision. The Patient Perception Scale is used to elicit patients' perceptions of who made the decision of whether or not to have surgery. In a subgroup, we also use the Physician Perception Scale to investigate surgeons' perceptions of the same decision for the same consultations (Janz et al, 2004). The patient can then be classified as passive (i.e., surgeon made decision) vs collaborative/ active (i.e., patient shared in or made decision). The scale can only be applied to consultations where a treatment option has been considered. An additional category of 'not discussed' is therefore also included.",

For reliable modelling, logistic regression should have at least 10 cases for each explanatory variable for both categories of a binary dependant variable (Peduzzi et al, 1996;Bland, 2005). The main limiting factor is therefore the number of patients not receiving primary surgery for operable breast cancer (17% in our previous study (Lavelle et al, 2007a) -a 1 : 4.9 ratio of no surgery to surgery). To have at least 10 times as many cases as variables for patients not receiving surgery, we therefore need 110 patients not receiving surgery to allow a maximum of 11 explanatory variables.

The model was built in line with our Data Analyses Plan agreed a priori with the project's Independent Data Monitoring Committee modifying an approach suggested by Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000). A base model containing explanatory variables of primary clinical importance to the study was constructed including age group, patient role in surgical decision and co-morbidity (as the only measure of pre-existing disease). The remaining explanatory variables were considered unless the significant effect was only in the 'missing' category of data. Variables were considered in three groups and added into the model in order of importance to the primary aim of the study, that is, health measures, tumour characteristics and then sociodemographics. Within each group the order in which variables were added into the model was determined by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values of each variable added into the model individually. Variables with lower BIC values were added in sequentially starting with the variable giving the lowest value. At each step an individual variable's contribution to the model was assessed using two criteria: (1) the difference between the model with the additional variable and the previous model using the Likelihood Ratio Test (a.k.a. analysis of deviance) and (2) producing a significant coefficient in the model (both at a 5% significance level). In order to reduce the likelihood of multicollinearity and to ensure the number of cases in the model could sustain the potentially high number of health measures, they were only retained in the model if they produced both a significant coefficient and likelihood ratio test. Tumour characteristics and socio-demographic variables were retained if they had a significant likelihood ratio test only. Once each group of variables had been added variance inflation factors were checked and variables exhibiting factors above 10 removed to prevent multicollinearity (Kutner et al, 2004).",

Ages ranged from 34% aged 70-74 years, 30% 75-80 years, 19% 80-84 years to 17% aged X85 years ( Table 2). The sample was predominantly of professional/intermediate social class and white ethnic group. Over half were treated at a district general hospital rather than a university teaching hospital. The majority of participants (62.4%) believed that the option of having surgery (vs not having surgery) was not discussed with them. Of the 35.2% who felt it was discussed, nearly twice as many identified themselves as active/collaborative vs passive in making this decision. Conversely, 62.2% of surgeons indicated that the option of no surgery vs surgery was discussed with the patient. More than double the proportion of surgeons identified patients as active/ collaborative in this decision (52.8%) than patients did themselves (22.9%). Of the 480 patients for whom the surgeon CPS was not missing, 473 had a corresponding patient CPS referring to the same index consultation (Table 3). Of these, in 249 cases the patient and the surgeon selected the same option regarding the patient's role in the surgical decision (52.6%) giving a kappa value of 0.261, indicating fair agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977). The majority of disagreement is due to the 123 cases (26.0%) in which the patient felt the option of surgery vs no surgery was not discussed but the surgeon felt that it was and that the patient was active/collaborative in this discussion. Just over 40% of the sample were recorded with stage I disease at diagnosis; 58.3% were stage II or IIIa and were hence regarded as having early operable breast cancer (SIGN, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, 1998) (Table 4). Over two thirds of the sample (70.1%) had no nodal involvement recorded at diagnosis and over half the sample had small tumours of p20 mm (53.9%). The vast majority of participants were steroid receptor positive for either oestrogen or progesterone receptors (85.5%).",

After controlling for the effect of patient choice, health and tumour characteristics only the oldest age group had significantly reduced odds of surgery with women aged X85 years having just over one fifth of the odds of receiving surgery compared with 70-74-year-olds (OR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.10-4.46).

            "text": "In this prospective cohort study of 800 women aged X70 years diagnosed with invasive operable breast cancer, women aged X85 years were less likely to have surgery adjusting for the effects of patient health and choice. The reduction in surgical rates with increasing age demonstrated in this study is in broad agreement with previous studies both in the UK (Golledge et al, 2000;Wyld et al, 2004;Lavelle et al, 2007aLavelle et al, ,b, 2012 and elsewhere (Hillner et al, 1996;Giordano et al, 2005;Naeim et al, 2006). However, previous studies reporting unadjusted surgical rates demonstrate reduced odds of surgery from the age of 70 years and older (Bastiaannet et al, 2010;Lawrence et al, 2011;Tang et al, 2011); a pattern also demonstrated in our unadjusted odds reported here. Once patient health and choice were adjusted for, both the location and size of effect changed. Although the pattern of decreased odds of surgery with increasing age remained, only the oldest women aged X85 years retained significantly reduced odds of surgery; around a fifth for adjusted odds compared with those aged 70-74-year-olds vs a tenth for unadjusted odds. However, neither patient health nor choice accounts for the lack of surgery for the oldest women aged X85 years. This reduction in effect size, to the point of non-significance, for 75-84-year-olds appears to be largely driven by adjustment for measures of health rather than patient choice. In the main and  nested models only whether or not the patient perceived the surgical treatment decision was discussed remained significant. Measuring and adjusting for patient choice in terms of responsibility for treatment decisions builds on previous research, which either simply records whether a treatment option was offered or whether 'patient choice' is listed as a reason for lack of treatment in case notes. As Hamaker et al (2013), point out this latter approach is flawed because 'what is stated to be the patient's preference could in fact be a reflection of the physician's preference' (p550). In our prospective cohort we measure responsibility for the surgical treatment decision from both the surgeon's and the patient's perspective using the previously validated CPS (Degner et al, 1997).",

            "text": "On the basis of responses to the CPS there is no evidence that there was active choice not to have surgery among those who did not have surgery. These findings suggest that the lack of surgery for the oldest patients is not due to them actively opting out of having this treatment. However, actually having the discussion about not having/having surgery is associated with reduced likelihood of receiving surgery. Tang et al (2011) also found that 58.9% (66 out of 112) breast cancer patients aged 470 years did not go on to have surgery after being offered a choice of this or treatment with hormone therapy. A likely explanation for this is that the option of not having surgery is only offered/discussed if there are concerns about the patient undergoing surgery. Among the measures of heath, the strongest predictor of undergoing surgery was the functional status measure of ADL. Activities of Daily Living has been shown in previous studies to predict access to and outcomes from surgery in terms of complications and HRQoL (Extermann and Hurria, 2007;Lavelle et al, 2007a;Audisio et al, 2008;Pal et al, 2010). ADL measures the ability to function independently in everyday life and is a consistent component of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment; a battery of varying health status and functional tests recommended by the International Society for Geriatric Oncology as an essential element of treatment decision making for older cancer patients (Biganzoli et al, 2012). The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer also states that 'maintenance of function and independence should be one of the major principles of cancer management in the elderly' (Pallis et al, 2010). The strength of ADL's prediction of having surgery, both in this and previous studies, suggest that maintenance of independence is a pivotal consideration for older patients contemplating surgery.",

            "text": "The ECOG PS scale also measures functional status and has been shown to predict surgical outcomes for older cancer patients (Audisio et al, 2008). With the added attraction of brevity (5 items vs 18 in the ELPHS ADL), it is collected by some NHS breast care teams as part of the Cancer Outcomes and Services Dataset (NCIN, National Cancer Intelligence Network, 2013). However, although ECOG PS was associated with surgery in the univariable analyses, its effect lost significance once ELPHS ADL along with other measures of health were adjusted for. Previous studies suggest that ECOG PS may lack sensitivity as although 70-80% of older adults with cancer present with an ECOG PS of 0-1 (indicating at least capable of all basic self-care), greater than half require assistance with the more advanced/instrumental ADLs such as housework, meal preparation and shopping (Extermann, 2000;Pal et al, 2010). ADL therefore is more likely to have sufficient sensitivity to identify patients on the threshold of needing additional help to maintain independence. At the point of making the decision to have surgery or not, this may enable post-surgical-care packages to be put in place pre-operatively if necessary. Although co-morbidity was associated with surgery in univariable analyses, its effect lost significance in the main multivariable model adjusting for other measures of health. Co-morbidity has been found to predict lack of treatment in several previous studies of older women with breast cancer (Ballard-Barbash et al, 1996;H\u00e9rbert-Croteau et al, 1999;Giordano et al, 2005;Naeim et al, 2006;Lavelle et al, 2012). However, this is by no means a universal finding (Hillner et al, 1996;Silliman et al, 1997;Mandelblatt et al, 2000;Lavelle et al, 2007a), particularly in studies, which also adjusted for measures of functional/health status (Silliman et al, 1997;Mandelblatt et al, 2000;Lavelle et al, 2007a). This suggests that measures of functional/health status may have a stronger bearing on treatment decision making than co-morbidity for older breast cancer patients. This may particularly be the case for long standing chronic co-morbidities, such as diabetes or asthma, which may be well managed and therefore have little impact on everyday function or indeed the decision to have surgery for breast cancer or not.",

            "text": "There is some evidence that surgical rates are improving for older women with breast cancer in the UK. The overall surgical rate in the study reported here (83.0% in 2010-2013) would fall in line with the increase over time reported in our previous study based on cancer registry data, from 67.4% in 199767.4% in -199967.4% in to 75.1% in 200367.4% in -200567.4% in (Lavelle et al, 2012. Although this may, in part, reflect improving completeness of treatment data, increasing surgical rates over time have also been reported in national audits (NCASP, National Clinical Audit Support Programme, 2009). It therefore seems likely that the improved surgical rates also demonstrate changes in practice, reflecting the guidelines that were published and the major reorganising of cancer services over the Compared with all breast cancers registered in England in 2011 our sample under represented women aged X85 years, that is, 26.0% nationally (ONS, Office of National Statistics, 2011) compared with 17.3% (95% CI: 14.7-20.0%) in the study reported here. This may be due to the exclusion of advanced/inoperable breast cancer in our sample as older patients are more likely to present at a later stage at which the tumour is advanced/inoperable (Ramirez et al, 1999). However, the under-representation of older patients is also likely to be due in part to selection bias, as participants needed to be capable of consent and be interviewed in order to take part in the study. Nevertheless, the proportion of patients having a Charleson co-morbidity score of X1 (48.0%, 95% CI: 44.5-51.5%) is similar to that found in previous studies, which measure breast cancer patients co-morbidity prospectively (Ring et al, 2011;Lavelle et al, 2012). For example, Ring et al found 44.5% (95% CI: 41.6-47.5%) of patients aged X70 years taking part in the ATAC trial had a Charleson score of X1. Similarly, our estimates of ADL are in line with our own (Lavelle et al, 2007a) and others (Sharples et al, 2000) estimates in studies of older adults living in the community. However, these previous studies are likely to be subject to the same influence of selection bias and it is probable that older women unable to consent/take part in an interview would have poorer health than younger ones who can. Selection bias towards younger and probably physically healthier women may have limited the generalisability of the study. Yet the results still clearly demonstrated a reduction in standard surgery for women aged X85 years. A larger sample including older less healthy women would have been expected to increase the association between increasing age and non-standard management of breast cancer.",

However, once health measures as well as patient role in treatment decision were adjusted Table 7. Multivariable (nested) logistic regression of receiving primary surgery (vs not receiving primary surgery) adjusting for surgeons' views on role of patient in surgical decision (n \u00bc 473) Co-morbidity, ER/PR and tumour size were not included as there was no significant effect in the main multivariable model. ELPHS ADL was retained as it showed the strongest effect among the health measures with significant effect in the main model. EORTC QLQ and smoking status were therefore not included. for, women aged X85 years were still less likely to have surgery. Although surgical rates for older breast cancer patients appear to be increasing, lack of surgery for women aged X85 years persists even when health and patient choice are adjusted for. These findings suggest that, as defined by national policy, 'inappropriate undertreatment' is still occurring for this oldest age group in the UK.",
