            "text": "The giant cardon cactus, Pachycereus pringlei (S. Watson) Britton & Rose (Cactaceae), is a columnar cactus that is widely distributed in the Sonoran Desert in Mexico, including the Baja California peninsula, all islands in the Gulf of California, and the coastal region of Sonora State (Turner et al., 1995). This species offers an attractive model for evolutionary studies. Its wide distribution is characterized by a heterogeneous array of environmental conditions (Garcill\u00e1n et al., 2010), as well as a geographic variation in the distribution of its major pollinator, the lesser long-nosed bat Leptonycteris curasoae (Fleming et al., 1998). Heterogeneity in biotic and abiotic factors can result in differential selective pressures across populations, promoting genetic differentiation and local adaptation. For P. pringlei , a latitudinal pattern of abundance, height, and basal diameter in the Baja California peninsula is associated with annual and summer rainfall, as well as winter temperature (Medel-Narv\u00e1ez et al., 2006). This species also exhibits an unusual geographical variation",

These polymorphic loci will be useful in studies of genetic diversity and genetic population differentiation and provide valuable information to understand the importance of biotic and abiotic factors involved in geographic variation in the genetic pool of this widespread cactus of the Sonoran Desert.",
