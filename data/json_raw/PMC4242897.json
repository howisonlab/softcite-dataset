Methods: On the basis of morphological performance, we divided lung IMAs into two subgroups, mucus-in-cell adenocarcinoma (MICA) and mucus-out-of-cell adenocarcinoma (MOCA). We investigated differences in clinicopathological characteristics, recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and a spectrum of well-identified driver-gene mutations, including EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, ALK, ROS1, and RET, between the two subgroups. Results: Of 1,699 lung adenocarcinomas, 148 were identified as IMAs (97 MICAs and 51 MOCAs). The MICA patient group had significantly better RFS than did the MOCA group (39.4 months versus 33.0 months, respectively, log rank P=0.020) and significantly better OS (54.2 months versus 45.1 months, log rank P=0.034). There were no differences in RFS and OS between those with IMAs and those with mucus-negative adenocarcinomas. The frequency of the EGFR gene mutation was significantly higher in MOCAs than in MICAs (P,0.001). In contrast, the KRAS gene had a significantly higher mutational frequency in MICAs (P=0.01). MOCAs also had a significantly higher incidence of lymph-node metastasis (P,0.05). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this study represents the first comparison of clinical features, molecular alterations, and prognosis in morphological subgroups of lung IMAs. Clinical and pathological features in conjunction with molecular data indicate that IMA should be divided into different subgroups.",

            "text": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. 1 The most common pathological subtype of diagnosed NSCLC is adenocarcinoma, which has an increasing prevalence. A new classification for lung adenocarcinoma was proposed by an international multidisciplinary expert panel from International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/ European Respiratory Society (IASLC/ATS/ERS) in 2011, 2 while the definition of mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma is no longer used. Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) was recognized as a separate subtype of lung adenocarcinoma, which was supposed to contain components of columnar or goblet cells with abundant intracellular or extracellular mucus admixed with invasive adenocarcinoma patterns with This article was published in the following Dove Press journal: OncoTargets and Therapy 18 November 2014 Number of times this article has been viewed stromal invasion. Compared with other lung adenocarcinoma subtypes, IMA has different immunohistochemical and molecular features, as well as a different prognosis. [3][4][5] Mucinous adenocarcinoma occurs in various organs and has two main kinds of histological appearance. In one, the tumor is composed of columnar or goblet cells with abundant intracellular mucus accumulation; in the other, the tumor has abundant extracellular mucus admixed with invasive adenocarcinoma patterns with stromal invasion. IMAs occurring in lung also share the above two kinds of histological appearance. We performed this retrospective study on surgically resected lung IMAs, with the aim to distinguish the differences in clinicopathological feature, molecular features, and prognosis between IMAs subgroups with these two kinds of morphological performance.",

            "text": "Since the appearance of the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification of lung adenocarcinoma in 2011, many studies have focused on the influence of pathological subtype on prognosis and molecular change. [9][10][11] IMAs, which account for 2%-10% of lung adenocarcinoma cases in East Asia, Europe, and the United States, [11][12][13] were considered to be more malignant than other common subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma, such as lepidic and acinar subtypes. 14 To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the differences in prognosis and molecular alterations in IMA subgroups with different morphological features. Therefore, we performed this study to investigate if it is reasonable to divide invasive mucinous lung adenocarcinoma into separate parts. Some previous studies demonstrated that IMAs correlated with worse prognosis. 4,15 However, in some recent studies, IMA subtype failed to reach statistical significance as a worse prognosis predictor. 16 Considering this discrepancy on the predictive value of IMA subtype on prognosis, we performed survival analysis between IMA patients and mucus-negative patients. Our results indicated that the IMA patients did not have a worse prognosis than mucus-negative patients do. Dividing IMAs into two subgroups by different morphological performance and comparing all groups, we found that patients with MICA showed a potential trend of better prognosis than did mucus-negative patients, while MOCAs seemed to have the worst prognosis of all three subgroups. Our results indicated that IMA subtype alone may not be an adequate predictor for worse prognosis. Different morphological performances may have potential predictive value on clinical outcome. We also observed distinct prognoses between IMAs with different morphological performance. Patients with MICA had a better RFS and OS than did their counterparts with MOCA. Lymph-node metastasis also occurred more frequently in patients with MOCA. To our knowledge, no similar study has revealed different clinical outcomes between invasive mucinous lung adenocarcinoma subgroups with different mucus distributions. Mucinous adenocarcinomas in other organs are also associated with lymph-node metastasis and worse prognosis, [17][18][19][20] and mucus is considered to play a critical role in the development of cancer. 21 Thus, we suspect that the common phenomenon is related to the same mucinous component in different cancers. When the mucus is out of the cell, the tumor may have aggressive biological behavior. However, further study is needed to form a more reliable conclusion.",

Also, a higher prevalence of ALK fusion was observed in IMAs than in unselected lung adenocarcinoma. 24 We further analyzed the association between morphological feature and molecular alteration, finding that the frequency of EGFR mutation was remarkably higher in MOCAs than in MICAs and that KRAS mutation significantly prevailed in MICAs. These findings suggest that there is a distinct difference in molecular change in these two subgroups of IMA, and that MICAs and MOCAs are two different kinds of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, more accurate distinction is required to be made in IMAs.",
