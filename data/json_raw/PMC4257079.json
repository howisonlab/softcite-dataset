            "text": "The hemodialysis procedure involves contact between peripheral blood and the surface of dialyzer membranes, which may lead to alterations in the pathways of innate and adaptive immunity. We aimed to study the effect of blood-membrane interaction on human peripheral basophils and neutrophils in hemodialysis with high-and low-permeability polysulfone dialyzers. The surface expression of CD203c (basophil selection marker) and CD63 (activation marker) after activation by the bacterial peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or anti-Fc\u03b5 receptor I (Fc\u03b5RI) antibody and the absolute number of basophils was investigated before and after hemodialysis with each of the dialyzers. Moreover, the expression on neutrophils of CD11b, the CD11b active epitope, and CD88 was analyzed in the same groups of individuals. The expression of CD63 in basophils following activation by fMLP was significantly higher in the patient group compared with that in healthy controls, but no differences were observed after activation by anti-Fc\u03b5RI. During the hemodialysis procedure, the low-flux membrane induced up-regulation of CD63 expression on basophils, while passage through the high-flux membrane did not significantly alter the responsiveness. In addition, the absolute number of basophils was unchanged after hemodialysis with either of the dialyzers and compared with healthy controls. We found no significant differences in the expression of the neutrophil activation markers (CD11b, the active epitope of CD11b, and CD88) comparing the two different dialyzers before and after dialysis and healthy controls. Together, these findings suggest that alterations in basophil activity may be a useful marker of membrane bioincompatibility in hemodialysis.",

            "text": "cellulose membranes were used in the early era of hemodialysis but have long since been substituted by membranes based on modified cellulose (cellulose diacetate and hemophan) and subsequently by membranes manufactured from synthetic polymers (polyacrylonitrile [AN69] or polysulfone). The modified and synthetic materials were introduced to improve the biocompatibility of dialyzers. In previous studies, it has been shown that neutrophils from patients dialyzed with polysulfone membranes have higher functionality compared with cells collected from patients treated with unmodified or modified cellulose membranes (5). The hemodialysis procedure induces complement activation, as evidenced by the increased production of complement factors. These factors contribute to dialysis-associated microinflammation through the release of interleukins (ILs) by monocytes, which exert chemotactic activity on neutrophils and monocytes (10). The intensity of complement generation is closely dependent on the type of dialysis membrane (11). In addition, the permeability of the membrane contributes to the overall biocompatibility properties. High-flux dialyzers (with large pore size and higher ultrafiltration coefficients) have better clearance of large molecules, such as \u03b22-microglobulin and toxins with enzymatic and metabolic inhibitory effect, compared with low-flux dialyzers (with smaller pore size and lower ultrafiltration coefficients), but the clinical consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality of long-term use are still debated (12)(13)(14).",

            "text": "Basophils constitute a subtype of granulocytes and represent <1% of total circulating leukocytes (15). Involvement of basophils in autoimmune kidney diseases, such as lupus nephritis, has previously been observed. Formation of immune complexes may trigger basophils to secrete IL-4 and initiate T helper type 2 (Th2) differentiation, B-cell proliferation, plasma cell differentiation, and immunoglobulin production, responsible for the ongoing humoral immune response in affected tissues (16,17). It has also been proposed that hemodialysis patients display IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions and that basophils from patients with autoimmune kidney disease up-regulate the cell surface expression of markers such as CD203c and CD63 upon activation (18,19). Studies have previously shown that neutrophil activity can be used to reflect the biocompatibility properties of different dialyzers. For example, CD11b expression on neutrophils was increased after hemodialysis with unsubstituted and substituted cellulosic membranes, while it was similar to that in healthy controls after hemodialysis with synthetic polysulfone membranes (7).",

The basophil response was increased after passage through the low-flux polysulfone dialyzer but unchanged following passage through the high-flux membrane. Cross-linking of Fc\u03b5 receptors on the basophil surface results in a stronger response than activation by fMLP. It has been shown that patients undergoing hemodialysis may develop anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions. The underlying mechanism involved in hemodialysis-associated anaphylactic reactions may be related to activation of basophils through cross-linking of Fc\u03b5RI on the surface of basophils and rapid release of histamine and heparin and a delayed release of IL-4 (18). IL-4 is regarded as a key mediator in the tuning of the T-cell differentiation, favoring a Th2 response (25,26).

            "text": "in high-and low-flux polysulfone membranes have an impact on cell activation, as the clinical use of highflux dialyzers has been suggested to reduce cardiovascular mortality and improve survival (13,14), even though there is an ongoing debate regarding the superiority of high-flux dialyzers over low-flux ones (27). As high-flux dialyzers are more efficient in removing immune modulators generated during the dialysis procedure, this is in line with our finding of increased basophil activation after low-flux hemodialysis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the hemodialysis procedure may lead to neutropenia, monocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia (28)(29)(30). Therefore, we analyzed the absolute number of basophils and did not detect any significant effects on cell number following passage through the different dialyzers. This implies that the variation in the basophil response was due to functional changes and not a consequence of entrapment of low-responding cells in the dialyzer.",

For example, during neutrophil adhesion and transendothelial migration, there is a rapid translocation of CD11b (a member of the integrin family) from an intracellular pool to the cell surface, followed by receptor aggregation and conformational change in the active epitope (31). It is well established that different dialyzer surfaces impact the function of neutrophils. It has been reported that CD11b expression on neutrophils increases at the beginning of hemodialysis with several types of dialyzers but declines to basal level at the end of the procedure with biocompatible dialyzers such as polysulfone membranes, while it remains high after dialysis with bioincompatible membranes (32,33). In the present study, we investigated both the surface expression of CD11b and the expression of the active epitope on neutrophils but found no significant differences in the expression of either marker after one session of hemodialysis between the low-flux membrane and the high-flux polysulfone membrane.",

As the molecular weight of C5a is similar to that of \u03b22-microglobulin, this anaphylatoxin can be cleared by high-flux membranes due to a different kinetic gradient. We therefore investigated the expression of C5a receptor type 1 (CD88) on neutrophils as a cellular marker for complement activation. Following interaction with the ligand C5a, the receptors internalize within minutes to induce responses such as chemotaxis of neutrophils with up-regulation of CD11b, granule enzyme release, superoxide anion production, and platelet-neutrophil microaggregation (36). In a previous study, a high-flux dialysis membrane induced a decrease in C5a receptor expression on neutrophils in three out of four patients, but internalized C5aR expression showed a nonsignificant change (37). We did not find any significant differences in CD88 expression on neutrophils from patients undergoing high-flux hemodialysis compared with low-flux dialysis, which could be due to the difference in number of study subjects or insensitivity of this molecule for assessment of bioincompatibility.",

Of interest is that earlier studies reported a correlation between the cytokine IL-1 and the induction of histamine release from basophils (38). Bradykinin generation has been reported to be increased during hemodialysis with polysulfone membranes, which can be explained by the fact that the membrane surface carries negatively charged groups, which may activate the Hageman factor (coagulation factor XII), known to convert prekallikrein to kallikrein, which will generate bradykinin from high-molecular-weight kininogen (39,40). The bradykinin can trigger the IgE-independent activation of basophils to induce an anaphylactoid reaction during hemodialysis (18). Interestingly, we have also recently shown that the level of eotaxin, a potent chemoattractant to basophils (acting through CCR3 receptors), was increased in patients with CKD (41).",
