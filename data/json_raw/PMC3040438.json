Methods: One hundred American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II female patients were randomized to receive an effect-site concentration of remifentanil of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 ng/ml. Induction of anaesthesia was started with intravenous injection of propofol 2 mg/kg. Ninety seconds after the completion of propofol injection, rocuronium (0.8 mg/kg) and remifentanil were administered simultaneously with 3% desflurane inhalation. Tracheal intubation was attempted 150 sec after the commencement of remifentanil administration. Results: A probit model of remifentanil concentration was predictive of successful intubation without development of hypertension (P for goodness-of-fit = 0.419). The effect-site concentration of remifentanil needed to achieve successful intubation without development of hypertension in 95% of the patients was 3.3 ng/ml (95% confidence interval, 2.6-4.8 ng/ml). Conclusions: The effect-site concentration of remifentanil of 3.3 ng/ml is effective in blunting the haemodynamic response in 95% of the patients when 2.0 mg/kg of propofol induction was followed by 3% desflurane inhalation.",

Remifentanil, a derivative of fentanyl, is a rapid onset, ultra-short acting agonist [15], and its rapid kinetics are well matched with those of desflurane. Little is known about the dose of remifentanil that can effectively prevent the haemodynamic response to desflurane inhalation. Weiskopf et al. [16] have reported that maintenance of anaesthesia with 4% desflurane produced no sympathetic or cardiovascular stimulation. To eliminate the possible sympathetic response evoked by desflurane, a 3% inhalation concentration of desflurane was used in this study. There was no difference in the end-tidal concentration of desflurane between the five groups of this study.",
