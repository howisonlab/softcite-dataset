Methods: One hundred American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II female patients were randomized to receive an effect-site concentration of remifentanil of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 ng/ml. Induction of anaesthesia was started with intravenous injection of propofol 2 mg/kg. Ninety seconds after the completion of propofol injection, rocuronium (0.8 mg/kg) and remifentanil were administered simultaneously with 3% desflurane inhalation. Tracheal intubation was attempted 150 sec after the commencement of remifentanil administration. Results: A probit model of remifentanil concentration was predictive of successful intubation without development of hypertension (P for goodness-of-fit = 0.419). The effect-site concentration of remifentanil needed to achieve successful intubation without development of hypertension in 95% of the patients was 3.3 ng/ml (95% confidence interval, 2.6-4.8 ng/ml). Conclusions: The effect-site concentration of remifentanil of 3.3 ng/ml is effective in blunting the haemodynamic response in 95% of the patients when 2.0 mg/kg of propofol induction was followed by 3% desflurane inhalation."
