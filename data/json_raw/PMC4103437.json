            "text": "Lack of macro-and microscopic characters in fungi severely hampers species identifi cation. This is particularly true for the inconspicuous species complex known as Sebacina vermifera (Oberw.) P. Roberts (family Sebacinaceae, order Sebacinales, informally assigned as subgroup B [ Weiss et al., 2004 ]). These fungi are not known to form basidiocarp or hymenial layers (Oberwinkler et al., 2013). However, DNA sequencing of samples taken from soil or root samples indicates that there is extensive diversity within this species complex (Weiss et al., 2004). Thus, it is likely that there are many species yet to be determined in this group. Australian terrestrial orchids within the genera Caladenia R. Br., Glossodia R. Br., Elythranthera (Endl.) A. S. George, and Eriochilus R. Br. form mycorrhizal associations with fungi of the S. vermifera subgroup B species complex. However, the actual number of Sebacina species associated with these orchids is presently unknown. Two commonly used markers for fungal species identifi cation, the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and mitochondrial large subunit (mLSU), both suggest that species-level differences exist among orchid mycorrhizal isolates extracted from these orchid genera (Weiss et al., 2004 ; Wright et al., 2010). Here we report the development of additional loci to aid accurate species identifi cation of orchid mycorrhizal fungi allied to S. vermifera. METHODS AND RESULTS Partial genome sequencing for genetic marker development-A Sebacina isolate from C. huegelii Rchb. f. and Eriochilus pulchellus Hopper & A. P. Br., as well as three isolates from Eriochilus dilatatus Lindl., were grown in liquid culture and DNA was extracted as described previously (Roche et al., 2010). For the C. huegelii isolate, sequences were generated with a 3-kb mate-pair library on the GS FLX 454 platform with GS XL70 sequencing chemistry (454 Life Sciences, a Roche Company, Branford, Connecticut, USA). CLC Genomics Workbench software (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) was used to separately assemble the C. huegelii sequences using the default assembly parameters. Sequences for the isolates from Eriochilus were produced with a HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) using paired-end libraries with 350-bp fragments. Reads were quality fi ltered, and the adapters were removed using libngs (https://github.com/ sylvainforet/libngs) using a minimum quality of 25 bp and a minimum read size of 150 bp. The genomic assemblies were carried out with SPAdes (Bankevich et al., 2012) using the following options: \"-k 21,33,55,77,99,127careful-t 16-m 64\". To design phylogenetic markers that are broadly applicable, we focused primer design on common regions of high sequence homology. Initially, we compared the four Sebacina isolates from Eriochilus against the C. huegelii isolate within CLC Genomics Workbench software. This allowed us to target the high homology sequence regions shared across the fi ve isolates for positioning the primers. Out of the 58,295 successful reads of Sebacina from C. huegelii , there were 1251 shared reads with E. pulchellus (average length 285 bp) and 950 to 1605 shared reads with E. dilatatus isolates (average length",

These new markers will enable future studies investigating species delineation and phylogenetic relationships of the fungal symbionts and facilitate investigations into evolutionary interactions among Sebacina species and their orchid hosts. \u2022 Methods and Results: We generated partial genome sequences for a Sebacina symbiont originating from Caladenia huegelii with 454 genome sequencing and from three symbionts from Eriochilus dilatatus and one from E. pulchellus using Illumina sequencing. Six nuclear and two mitochondrial loci showed high variability (10-31% parsimony informative sites) for Sebacinales mycorrhizal fungi across four genera of Australian orchids ( Caladenia , Eriochilus , Elythranthera , and Glossodia ). \u2022 Conclusions: We obtained highly informative DNA markers that will allow investigation of mycorrhizal diversity of Sebacinaceae fungi associated with terrestrial orchids in Australia and worldwide.",

Sequences were edited using the program Sequencher version 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) and aligned in Geneious Pro version 6.1.6 ( Drummond et al., 2011 ). Consistent and high-quality amplifi cation of all tested Sebacina isolates occurred for eight primer sets ( Table 2 ). Estimates of variability across the alignment of up to 31 sequences were performed within MEGA version 5.2 ( Tamura et al., 2011 ). The eight markers revealed 15-40% nucleotide diversity and 11-31% parsimony informative sites across these sequences ( Table 2 ).",

Priming sites were selected for 19 consensus sequences using Primer3 ( Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000 ); selection was based on product length, ease of primer design, and gene designation. Roche et al. (2010) , was obtained for several Sebacina isolates from host species within the Australian orchid genera Caladenia (14 spp.), Glossodia (2 spp.), Eriochilus (3 spp.), and Elythranthera (1 sp.). A total of 31 isolates were evaluated for DNA sequence diversity with the new fungal primers described below ( Tables 1 and 2 , Appendix 1). This set represented one to four isolates each from the 13 most strongly supported phylogenetic clades as revealed by a preliminary screen with ITS (bootstrap support >0.78; data not shown) of Sebacina isolates associated with several Australian orchids.",
