Primary SS occurs alone, while secondary SS occurs in conjunction with another autoimmune disease [6,7]. Occasionally, ocular symptoms precede other features, but the diagnosis of SS is often delayed owing to its ambiguous symptoms. In one study [8], time from the first symptom to a diagnosis of SS was a mean of 7 years, with considerable psychological distress caused by unexplained symptoms during that time. Therefore, early non-invasive diagnosis is necessary for SS.",

Moreover, sometimes these tools have a low correlation with subjective symptoms. Much effort has been made to find an ideal diagnostic tool that is simple, specific, sensitive, objective, non-invasive, reproducible, and has a clear cut-off value. In recent years, tear osmolarity has been considered a reliable diagnostic marker of dry eye disease [10][11][12][13]. Further, technology has become available to measure tear osmolarity in the office setting with a microfluidic lab-on-a-chip device based on electrical impedance [14]. The TearLab Osmolarity System (TearLab, San Diego, CA, USA) can collect a tear sample atraumatically and provides an absolute numeric score. It provides results in a minute, and there is no interobserver variation.",

In 2002, a revised international classification of SS was established by the American-European Consensus Group [22].

Scatter plot showing significant correlations between Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score and average tear film osmolarity (\u03c1 = 0.405, p = 0.011), average Schirmer I test and average tear film osmolarity (\u03c1 = -0.625, p < 0.001), and average ocular staining score (OSS) and average tear film osmolarity (\u03c1 = 0.592, p < 0.001). The Spearman rank-order correlation test was used to evaluate the relationship between variables. OSS was by Sj\u00f6gren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance [23]. to van Bijsterveld's scoring system. The Schirmer I test represents the tear production rate and remains the mainstay of diagnosis. However, this test has some drawbacks with regard to interpretation of results in the event of reflex tearing, and the test strip induces irritation in patients with dry eye. Aside from the Schirmer I test, tear film osmometers are becoming popular for diagnosing dry eye. Until recently, quantification of inflammatory cytokines was limited to the research setting because of logistic problems such as the need for laboratory equipment and evaporation of tear samples in transit. In 2009, the TearLab Osmolarity System was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for assessment of dry eye. This system has several strengths over other clinical tools. The purpose of our study was to identify correlations between tear osmolarity and other ocular surface parameters in SS.",

One possible explanation for this is the subjective nature of the tear film break-up time test. Another explanation is that tear film hyperosmolarity in SS can be mainly induced by increased release of inflammatory cytokines into the tear film instead of a decreased tear volume because osmolarity is defined as the amount of osmotically active solutes (os-moles) present in 1 L of solution [27]. Further, an impact on this result is incidental because, as shown in the revised international classification for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (2002), the Schirmer test and corneal staining score are more important than tear film break-up time when diagnosing SS.",

In contrast, Szalai et al. [28] and Messmer et al. [29] have demonstrated that tear film osmolarity lacks the ability to distinguish between patients with and without dry eye. In our study population, mean tear osmolarity in the patients with SS was 311.1 \u00b1 16.4 mOsm/L; in 16 patients (41%), this value was over 316 mOsm/L. To the best of our knowledge, there is no suggested cut-off value for SS-related dry eye disease. Tear osmolarity can be affected by a number of environmental factors, including air f low, humidity, the patient's general state of health, systemic medication, and seasonal or diurnal variation. Further, some authors have shown that a tear sample taken from the meniscus may underestimate tears over the surface of the eye, especially in patients with dry eye disease [30]. Further investigations should be conducted to establish a cut-off value in consideration of the various factors affecting tear osmolarity.",

First, the results may be confounded by a lack of data on relevant variables, such as systemic medications and the effects of environmental factors on measurements. Although the effect of systemic medication on tear film stability remains unclear, a previous study concluded that systemic anti-inf lammatory treatment did not significantly affect tear osmolarity or OSDI score in patients with SS [21]. Second, the current study did not evaluate repeat measurements in the participants. Bunya et al. [20] found a high degree of variability for tear osmolarity measured by the TearLab Osmolarity System; there was an error associated with repeat measurements during one session in the patients with SS. Third, we found no correlation between tear osmolarity and other ocular surface parameters in non-Sj\u00f6gren dry eye group. We suppose the reason is that non-Sj\u00f6gren dry eye is multifactorial disease, although additional study is needed to answer this question. Finally, the present study was limited by the lack of inclusion of a control (non-dry eye disease) cohort, so it was not possible to evaluate normal variations. However, a major strength is that we evalu-ated almost all of the conventional tests for dry eye disease.",
