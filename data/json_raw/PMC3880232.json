            "text": "introduction: The Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI) is validated to measure nicotine dependence in nonpregnant smokers, and in these smokers, mean salivary and serum cotinine levels are related by a ratio of 1.25. However, as nicotine metabolism increases during gestation, these findings may differ in pregnancy. We investigated the validity of HSI in pregnancy by comparing this with 3 biochemical measures; in a search for a less-invasive cotinine measure in pregnancy, we also explored the relationship between mean blood and salivary cotinine levels. Methods: Cross-sectional analyses using baseline data from the Smoking, Nicotine, and Pregnancy Trial. Participants were 16-46 years old, 12-24 weeks gestation, smoked more than 5 cigarettes per day, and had exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) readings of at least 8 ppm. Linear regression was used to examine correlations between HSI and blood cotinine and salivary cotinine and exhaled CO. Correlation between blood and salivary cotinine was investigated using linear regression through the origin. results: HSI scores were associated with blood cotinine (R 2 = 0.20, n = 662, p < .001), salivary cotinine (R 2 = 0.11, n = 967, p < .001), and exhaled CO (R 2 = 0.13, n = 1,050, p < .001). Salivary and blood cotinine levels, taken simultaneously, were highly correlated (R 2 = 0.91, n = 628, p < .001) and the saliva:blood level ratio was 1.01 (95% CI 0.99-1.04). conclusions: Correlations between HSI and biochemical measures in pregnancy were comparable with those obtained outside pregnancy, suggesting that HSI has similar validity in pregnant smokers. Salivary and blood cotinine levels are roughly equivalent in pregnant smokers.",

A large American retrospective cohort study found infant mortality rates to be 40% higher in pregnant smokers than nonsmokers (Salihu, Aliyu, Pierre-Louis, & Alexander, 2003). Despite this, studies in the United States (Colman & Joyce, 2003;Mathews & Rivera, 2004) and United Kingdom (Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2012) showed that at least one third to one half of female smokers continue to smoke during pregnancy.",

            "text": "Nonpregnant smokers with higher levels of nicotine dependence find it harder to quit smoking (Chaiton, Cohen, McDonald, & Bondy, 2007;Courvoisier & Etter, 2010) and nicotine replacement therapy can assist with this (Tang, Law, & Wald, 1994). Hence, nicotine dependence may be a crucial factor in the maintenance of smoking behavior in pregnant women (Albrecht et al., 1999). One measure of nicotine dependence, the six-item Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD) has been validated and widely used outside of pregnancy (Burling & Burling, 2003;Carpenter, Baker, Gray, & Upadhyaya, 2010;Fagerstr\u00f6m, 2012;Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerstr\u00f6m, 1991). Of the six items included in FTCD, \"How soon after you wake up do you smoke your first cigarette?\" and \"How many cigarettes/ day do you smoke?\" have been shown to account for most of the FTCD predictive value for smoking cessation (Burling & Burling, 2003;Chabrol, Niezborala, Chastan, & de Leon, 2005;Chaiton et al., 2007;Etter, Duc, & Perneger, 1999;Fagerstr\u00f6m, Russ, Yu, Yunis, & Foulds, 2012;Haberstick et al., 2007;Heatherton et al., 1991;Kozlowski, Porter, Orleans, Pope, & Heatherton, 1994;P\u00e9rez-R\u00edos et al., 2009) and correlate most strongly with biochemical measures of tobacco smoke exposure (Etter et al., 1999;Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, Rickert, & Robinson, 1989). Hence, these two items have been combined in a shorter alternative measure of nicotine dependence, the Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI), which has also been used widely outside of pregnancy (Borland, Yong, O'Connor, Hyland, & Thompson, 2010;Chaiton et al., 2007; Advance Access publication August 13, 2013 145 nicotine & tobacco research, volume 16, number 2 (February 2014) 145-154 nicotine dependence measures in pregnancy Etter et al., 1999;John et al., 2004;Kozlowski et al., 1994;Lim et al., 2012). The notion that nicotine dependence is variable and can be measured (Burling & Burling, 2003) is important for characterizing smoking populations; measures of nicotine dependence are frequently used to describe participants in research studies and to guide smoking cessation treatment used by smokers (Tang et al., 1994).",

However, the timing and magnitude of gestational changes in nicotine metabolism are not known, and it is also not known if the relationship between smoking behaviors and nicotine metabolism remains constant as the latter changes. Consequently, it is not certain that the HSI, which has been validated to measure nicotine dependence in nonpregnant smokers, remains valid in pregnancy. After a review of the literature, we found no studies investigating the validity of HSI in pregnancy. However, we did find two studies that assessed two other nicotine dependence measures in pregnancy; one studied the FTCD (Panaretto et al., 2009) and the other, the Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ), a predecessor of FTCD. The first study (Panaretto et al., 2009) examined the use of FTCD in 152 urban, indigenous pregnant smokers in Australia. This found a statistically significant relationship between increasing FTCD scores and urinary cotinine concentrations. The other study (Albrecht et al., 1999) found a significant relationship between increasing FTQ scores and salivary cotinine levels in 42 pregnant adolescents recruited from three different smoking cessation studies. Although these studies suggest that both questionnaire-based measures may have some validity for measuring nicotine addiction in pregnancy, their sample sizes were small and more evidence is needed, particularly regarding the utility of the HSI in pregnancy.",

Cotinine levels can be measured in blood or saliva samples; however, the relationship between blood and salivary cotinine in pregnancy remains unclear due to the changes in nicotine metabolism (Dempsey, Jacob, & Benowitz, 2002;Rebagliato et al., 1998) and saliva composition during gestation (Eliasson, Birkhed, Osterberg, & Carl\u00e9n, 2006;Guidozzi, Maclennan, Graham, & Jooste, 1992;Laine et al., 1988). Epidemiological studies of nonpregnant smokers found that mean salivary cotinine levels are closely related to serum cotinine but are around 25% higher (Jarvis, Primatesta, Erens, Feyerabend, & Bryant, 2003). Quantification of the relationship in pregnancy would enable researchers to compare findings from studies of pregnant smokers, which use either serum or saliva samples and would permit researchers the flexibility to be pragmatic when deciding whether to use saliva or blood samples for cotinine estimation in research studies (Tricker, 2006).",

Assumptions of linear regression for each of the analyses were found to be adequately met. The relationships modeled appeared linear, and the residuals of the regression were normally distributed, showing no heteroscedasticity. Previous studies have found that age (Benowitz et al., 2009;Boyd, Windsor, Perkins, & Lowe, 1998), ethnicity (Benowitz et al., 2009;Boyd et al., 1998;Tricker, 2006), body mass index (BMI) (Jarvis et al., 2003;Tricker, 2006), and weeks of gestation (Benowitz et al., 2009;Dempsey et al., 2002;Rebagliato et al., 1998) affect nicotine metabolism and hence could be expected to influence salivary and blood cotinine levels. Having a smoking partner exposes the women to passive smoking, which would also affect the cotinine or CO levels (Boyd et al., 1998;Gilligan et al., 2010). As CO has a short half-life of 2-3 hr, CO levels are relatively easily affected by the time elapsed since smoking prior to measuring the CO level (Javors, Hatch, & Lamb, 2011;Marrone, Paulpillai, Evans, Singleton, & Heishman, 2010). Hence, adjustment for these a priori factors was performed. The linearity of the association between HSI with each of the biochemical measures was assessed by fitting the effect of HSI in seven quantiles and compared with a trend through these categories using likelihood ratio test. In order to compare the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) between associations of HSI with different biochemical measures, sensitivity analyses using subgroup of pregnant smokers who provided all three biochemical measures were done.",

Hence, findings in the study may not be generalizable to pregnant smokers of other racial background and who smoke fewer cigarettes or who have not expressed a desire to quit. However, our pregnant women smoked a mean of 14 cigarettes daily with mean HSI of 2.64, which was similar to previous studies in pregnant (England et al., 2001;Pollak et al., 2007; Office for National Statistics, 2013) and nonpregnant smokers (Courvoisier & Etter, 2010;Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2012). It is unclear if similar findings could be extrapolated to the first and third gestation of pregnancy. However, this may not affect the clinical importance of the findings as the first clinical encounter of the majority pregnant women would be during their booking visit when they are in the end of their first or beginning of their second trimester of pregnancy. Although our study found similar magnitude of the associations between HSI and biochemical markers with other studies of nonpregnant smokers, this was not tested formally using a control nonpregnant group due to study design.",

However, as a sensitivity analysis conducted in the much smaller group of women who provided all three biochemical measures revealed similar findings to those in the larger, less self-selected groups, we believe that any biases in women's propensity to provide samples are unlikely to have had a major effect on the relationships between HSI and biochemical measures observed in our study.",

An additional strength was the use of trained research midwives who followed a well-defined protocol to collect all questionnaire data and biological samples.

Although there may be a lack of agreement about the gold standard measure for nicotine dependence in pregnancy, blood cotinine is a sensitive and stable biochemical nicotine exposure measure from cigarette smoking (Dempsey et al., 2002;Kvalvik et al., 2012;Tricker, 2006) and has previously been used to validate nicotine dependence measures (Carpenter et al., 2010;SRNT Subcommittee on Biochemical Verification, 2002). In our study, after controlling for factors considered, a priori, to possibly affect cotinine or CO levels, a significant positive correlation was found between HSI scores and the three biochemical measures. Of the three biochemical measures, blood cotinine, which has previously been used as a \"gold standard\" in similar studies (Carpenter et al., 2010;SRNT Subcommittee on Biochemical Verification, 2002), was found to correlate best with HSI. Although the relationships observed were not strong, associations between salivary cotinine levels and HSI scores were comparable with those obtained in the very few studies conducted within nonpregnant smokers of similar sample size (Table 2). However, we could not find any previous studies comparing HSI with blood cotinine levels for comparison.

The stability of the relationship between HSI and cotinine measures in these varied samples of smokers suggests that HSI's validity for measuring nicotine dependence may be generic across smokers with very different characteristics. Our study found a generally linear relationship between HSI scores and biochemical measures of exposure, which was consistent with studies of nonpregnant smokers ( Table 2). The nonlinearity of the relationship between HSI scores and blood cotinine as suggested by the likelihood ratio testing must be interpreted with caution. Pregnant smokers with HSI scores of 6 had blood cotinine levels that were substantially higher than those predicted by linear regression (Figure 1), but as there are very few participants who had such high HSI scores, this finding could reflect the very small numbers of participants contributing to this analysis. Internal reliability of HSI in our sample of pregnant women was comparable with studies in nonpregnant smokers, which obtained Cronbach's \u03b1 of .49 to .56 (Burling & Burling, 2003;de Meneses-Gaya et al., 2009).",

The largest study included in the review (Jarvis et al., 2003) included 270 female nonpregnant smokers and found a ratio of salivary to plasma cotinine of 1.23 (95% CI 1.21-1.25). Although this study used plasma cotinine analyzed by gas chromatography rather than blood cotinine measured by liquid chromatography, blood samples from this study and from ours were processed by the same laboratory, and no difference in cotinine levels due to variation in sample analysis method was expected (Bernert et al., 2009).

The rise in estrogen in pregnancy may lower the pH and buffer capacity of saliva in pregnant women, affecting absorption of cotinine (Laine et al., 1988;Lukacs & Largaespada, 2006;Rebagliato et al., 1998). An alternative explanation may be that the increased nicotine metabolism in pregnancy (Rebagliato et al., 1998;Tricker, 2006) may affect salivary cotinine more than blood cotinine leading to the lower ratio, and further research is required.",

Future studies involving pregnant smokers can routinely incorporate HSI as a measure of nicotine dependence and, if preferred, cotinine assays can be performed using salivary samples rather than blood samples because these produce roughly equivalent cotinine values and obtaining saliva samples is less invasive. In pregnancy, when calculating mean salivary cotinine values from mean blood cotinine values, a ratio of 1 should be used instead of 1.25, which has been suggested for nonpregnant smokers.",
