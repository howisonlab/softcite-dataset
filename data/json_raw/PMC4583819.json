            "text": "Objective: Paraneoplastic neurologic disorders (PND) are autoimmune diseases associated with cancer and ectopic expression of a neuronal antigen in a peripheral tumor. Patients with PND harbor high-titer antibodies and T cells in their serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are specific to the tumor antigen, and treatment with the immunosuppressant FK506 (tacrolimus) decreases CSF white blood cell counts. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of FK506 on CSF chemokine levels in PND patients. Methods: CSF samples before and after FK506 treatment were tested by multiplex assay for the presence of 27 cytokines. Follow-up in vitro experiments aimed to determine whether T cells secrete CXCL10 in response to cognate antigen. Results: Here we report that PND patients harbor high levels of the chemokine CXCL10 in their CSF. CXCL10 is a cytokine that recruits CXCR3 1 cells such as activated T cells, and we found that FK506 treatment specifically decreased CSF CXCL10 from among 27 cytokines tested. In vitro, CXCL10 was only produced during antigenspecific cognate interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) when interferon-c (IFNc) receptors were present on the T cell. Interpretation: These results support a model in which antigen-specific T cell stimulation by PND APCs triggers IFNc, followed by CXCL10 production and further lymphocyte recruitment, suggesting that treatments targeting T cells or CXCL10 in the central nervous system (CNS) may interrupt a destructive positive feedback loop present in CNS inflammation."

            "text": "P araneoplastic neurologic disorders (PND) are characterized by an immune response against a neuronal antigen that is ectopically expressed by tumors outside the brain. This autoimmune response not only targets the tumor, but also the neurons that normally express the antigen. High-titer antibodies to the neuronal protein are found in both the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with PND. 1 However, antibodies are unlikely to be the sole cause of the neuronal destruction for those PNDs in which the target antigens are intracellular. 2,3 Moreover, PND antigen-specific CD8 1 T cells are present in the peripheral blood and CSF of patients with both paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) and the paraneoplastic Hu syndrome subtypes of PND. [4][5][6] Our laboratory has used FK506 (tacrolimus) in the experimental treatment of patients with PND with the goal of decreasing the number of PND antigen-specific T cells in the brain and attempting to arrest disease progression. FK506 reduces the number of activated T cells in the CSF of patients with PCD. 4 Not all PND patients demonstrate dramatic clinical improvements with this treatment, 7 perhaps in part because most patients are diagnosed and referred after the onset of the neuronal destruction that is characteristic of PND. 1 FK506, a lipid-soluble immunosuppressant used to prevent transplant rejection, 8 partitions well into the central nervous system (CNS). FK506 interferes with calcineurin phosphatase activity via FK-binding protein 12, leading to decreased activation of inflammatory genes regulated by the transcription factor NFAT, [8][9][10] and thereby inhibits T cell function. 9 Here we examined cytokine levels in the CSF of PND patients before and after treatment with FK506 after noting recurrent episodes of CSF pleocytosis following FK506 treatments in one PCD patient, suggesting that recruitment of peripheral PCD antigen-specific T cells to the CSF resumed after treatment. Such CXCL10dependent recruitment of T cells into the CNS has been documented previously in mice infected with West Nile virus. In this model, neurons of infected mice generate CXCL10, which recruits CD8 1 T cells into the CNS. 11 Cytokines and their receptors have also been proposed to help mediate CSF entry of peripheral T cells in multiple sclerosis (MS). 12 In particular, the chemokine CXCL10 is elevated in CSF during exacerbations of MS, and both CXCL10 and its receptor, CXCR3, are elevated in and colocalize with active MS lesions. 13 When we examined the peripheral blood and CSF of 8 patients for the presence of 27 cytokines, CXCL10 was consistently elevated in the CSF of all patients with PND. Remarkably, CXCL10 was the only cytokine that decreased after FK506 treatment in patients, and correlated with decreases in CSF white blood cell (WBC) counts. We investigated the potential contribution of T cells in the elevation of CXCL10 levels in the CSF, because both were affected by drug treatment. We observed that T cells and antigenpresenting cells (APCs) produce CXCL10 in an antigenspecific fashion and that production of this chemokine by T cells required expression of the interferon-c receptor (IFNcR) on the T cell. These observations support a model in which a positive feedback develops when antigen-specific T cells encounter APCs presenting target antigen in the brain, stimulating CXCL10 production, further T cell recruitment, and PND disease progression. Hence, targeting autoimmune T cells and CXCL10 together may help break this cycle, blocking further T cell homing to the CNS, suggesting a new treatment strategy for PND and allied T cellmediated CNS disorders.",

This patient was initially seen with relatively mild symptoms of cerebellar dysfunction that had been acutely worsening, and was treated with FK506 for 14 days, with subsequent clinical stabilization. After experiencing periods of symptom stability lasting from weeks to several months, she repeatedly developed episodes of acute symptom exacerbation. During the first two of these episodes, CSF was obtained prior to and following treatment. Analysis of her CSF revealed that during each clinical exacerbation the patient demonstrated a CSF pleocytosis that was reduced to normal or near-normal levels following FK506 treatment, which paralleled the reduction in CXCL10 levels in her CSF (see Fig 1C). This repeated elevation in CSF WBC suggested that after their elimination from the CSF, peripheral T cells were regaining access to the CNS. CXCR3 1 T Cells Are Enriched in the CSF of PND Patients Compared to Peripheral Blood CXCL10 is an IFNc inducible cytokine that stimulates the production and infiltration of inflammatory T cells and other cells expressing the CXCR3 receptor into inflamed sites. 19 PND patients typically have abnormally high numbers of WBCs in their CSF. 1 Hence, we examined CSF of PND patients for the presence of CXCR3 1 T cells. As has been reported in MS patients, 13 we observed enrichment of CXCR3 1 T cells in PND CSF when compared to the peripheral blood CXCR3 1 T cell population (Fig 2).

Previous work by our laboratory has shown that peripheral CD8 1 T cells specific for the HuD PND antigen express CXCL10. 6 Due to insufficient patient CSF T cells available for direct study, we modeled this question by assessing CXCL10 production from normal donor T cells upon encounter with specific antigen presented by DCs as APCs. CD4 1 or CD8 1 T cells were cocultured with DCs loaded with apoptotic influenza-infected 3T3 cells (for CD4 1 ) or DCs directly infected with influenza virus (for CD8 1 ). Analysis of supernatants from the cultures revealed that CXCL10 was only produced after a cognate CD4 1 or CD8 1 T cell-DC interaction (Fig 3A). CXCL10 secretion was coincident with IFNc production, which was measured as a positive control (Fig 3B). These data indicate that CXCL10 is produced after an interaction between antigen-specific T cells and an APC but not after noncognate interactions.",

            "text": "To assess whether these antigen-specific interactions led to CXCL10 production by T cells only, APCs only, or both cell types, we employed an assay similar to the human cell assay just described, but instead using cells from wild-type or CXCL10 null mice (Fig 4 A-D). T cells from influenzaimmunized mice were cocultured with DCs pulsed with relevant influenza nucleoprotein peptide or an irrelevant control peptide. Production of CXCL10 in wild-type conditions was found to be antigen-specific and paralleled production of IFNc, as was seen with human T cells. Similar results were obtained using T cells from ovalbuminimmunized mice (not shown). When influenza-specific CXCL10 2/2 CD4 1 or CD8 1 T cells were cocultured with wild-type DCs presenting antigen, the number of IFNcproducing cells present was similar to the number of IFNcproducing cells in the wild-type T cell condition. However, when CXCL10 2/2 T cells were cocultured with wild-type DCs, 3-fold less CXCL10 was detected. In comparison, no CXCL10 was detected when CXCL10 2/2 T cells were cocultured with CXCL10 2/2 DC. Similar data were obtained using T cells from ovalbumin protein-immunized rather than virus-immunized CXCL10 2/2 mice (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that T cells produce the majority of CXCL10 in this assay and that they do so in an antigen-specific manner. DCs themselves also contribute to the production of CXCL10 after encounter with a cognate T cell in this assay, because a low level of CXCL10 is still present in the CXCL10 2/2 T cells plus wild-type DC condition.   DC production of CXCL10 in an antigen-specific manner suggests the presence of a signal from T cells that have encountered their cognate antigen to the DC upon which the antigen is presented. One possible mediator of such a signal from the T cells is IFNc, because CXCL10 is known to be IFNc inducible 20 and both cytokines were produced in an antigen-specific manner in our cocultures. To address this possibility, we assessed CXCL10 production following antigen-specific T cell-DC interactions using cells from mice lacking the receptor for IFNc (IFNcR 2/2 ). Both IFNc and CXCL10 were produced when wild-type T cells encountered DCs presenting influenza antigen. However, when IFNcR 2/2 T cells encountered wild-type DCs presenting influenza antigen, CXCL10 was not detected despite detection of expected levels of IFNc (Fig 4E, F). These data support the idea that the IFNcR is required on the T cell for antigen-specific CXCL10 production.",

A second course of FK506 treatment in the same patient resulted in a similar decrease in CSF CXCL10 ( Fig 1C). We subsequently found that CXCL10 was decreased after FK506 treatment in 7 other PND patients (Fig 1A,  p 5 0.011). Importantly, 2 other chemokines also present in the CSF, CCL2 and CXCL8, were unaffected by the drug treatment in the same patients (p 5 0.401 and p 5 0.207, respectively). Moreover, the levels of 24 other cytokines (listed in Materials and Methods) were either undetectable or very similar to normal CSF, and were unaffected by FK506 treatment. The specificity of the effect of immunosuppressive therapy suggested a strong and potentially clinically relevant link to CNS inflammation in these patients that was pursued to discover a specific positive feedback loop. In this model (Fig 5), antigen-specific T cell stimulation by APCs within the CNS triggers T cell IFNc production, followed by CXCL10 secretion by both T cells and APCs, leading to further lymphocyte recruitment to the area of inflammation.",

A recently published study demonstrated that CXCL10 production by DC is important in DC-T cell interactions during priming of T cells in the lymph node. 24 It is possible that CXCL10 production by APCs is similarly important for reactivation and further recruitment of memory T cells in the brain in PND, and that CXCL10 production by responding T cells augments the response.",

            "text": "A leading candidate for mediating the signal for CXCL10 production between the APC and the T cell was the IFNcR, because IFNc is known to induce CXCL10 secretion. 20 When T cells lacking the IFNcR were cocultured with DC, antigen-specific production of CXCL10 was completely obliterated, whereas IFNc production remained unchanged (Fig 4E, F). This suggests that there is a T cell-intrinsic feedback loop for CXCL10 production, and that the low level of CXCL10 produced by the DCs may require the IFNcR-mediated T cell feedback loop as well (Fig 5). CXCL10 and the CXCR3 receptor have been proposed to work in an inflammation-promoting loop in allergy 27 and to modulate IFNc production in EAE. 28 CXCR3 has been suggested not only to play a role in T cell priming in the lymph node 24 but also in the recruitment of T cells into peripheral target tissues. 29 Taken together, these data suggest that the high concentration of CXCL10 present in PND patient CSF may be due to production of this chemokine by infiltrating autoimmune T cells interacting with APCs in the CNS. 30 However, EAE can be induced in CXCL10 2/2 mice, indicating that this chemokine is not essential for the development of this MS-like disease in mice. 30 It is important to note that previous in vivo studies of the inflammatory response to CNS virus infection and chronic EAE have demonstrated that astrocytes are a major source of CXCL10. 13,31,32 Our observations of CXCL10 production by DCs and T cells in an antigenspecific in vitro system do not rule out the possible additional production of CXCL10 by astrocytes or other cells in patients with PND. It may even be that one cell type is responsible for CXCL10 production early during disease initiation, and other cell types such as T cells and APCs participate in CXCL10 production to propagate the disease state. This could lead to recruitment of additional T cells into the CNS in general or into the parenchyma.",

In addition, the specific mechanism by which FK506 decreases CXCL10 in PND patient CSF is of interest. Although the inhibition of calcineurin activity in T cells is a known effect of FK506, additional intracellular targets such as p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase have been suggested. 33 Interestingly, our laboratory has recently shown that FK506 preferentially accumulates in DCs, thereby targeting T cells engaged in antigen-specific T cell-APC interactions. 34 It is possible that FK506 may similarly act upon APCs in the brain. Inhibition of the EAE animal model of MS has been observed with FK506 treatment. 35,36 It would be interesting to determine whether treatment of EAE or MS patients with FK506 decreases CXCL10 levels in a fashion similar to that shown in our PND patients. A limitation of our study is that patients were treated with both FK506 and a tapered prednisone dose. Thus, it is possible that some of the effect of treatment on CSF CXCL10 may be due to prednisone. However, based on studies by others, 37,38 it is reasonable to expect FK506 to be responsible for most or all of the effect.",

It is not known whether the arrival of T cells or peripheral APCs in the CNS or another process altogether is the initiating event for diseases such as PND. Interestingly, FIGURE 5: Proposed model of the interactions leading to CXCL10 production by T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The T cell is activated by its cognate antigen presented on an APC. The T cell secretes interferon-c (IFNc) in response to the antigen and senses autocrine or paracrine IFNc via the IFNc receptor (IFNcR). The T cell and APC secrete CXCL10 in this antigen-specific interaction, which recruits additional CXCR3 1 cells into the area. The signal that tells the APC to produce CXCL10 was not investigated in the current experiments, but may be related to expression of the IFNcR by APCs or other signals.",
