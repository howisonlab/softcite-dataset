            "text": "Alternative splicing has emerged as an important target for molecular therapies. Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) modulate alternative splicing by hybridizing to pre-mRNA sequences involved in splicing and blocking access to the transcript by splicing factors. Recently, the efficacy of SSOs has been established in various animal disease models; however, the application of SSOs against cancer targets has been hindered by poor in vivo delivery of antisense therapeutics to tumor cells. The apoptotic regulator Bcl-x is alternatively spliced to express anti-apoptotic Bcl-x L and proapoptotic Bcl-x S. Bcl-x L is upregulated in many cancers and is associated with chemoresistance, distinguishing it as an important target for cancer therapy. We previously showed that redirection of Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing from Bcl-x L to-x S induced apoptosis in breast and prostate cancer cells. In this study, the effect of SSO-induced Bcl-x splice-switching on metastatic melanoma was assessed in cell culture and B16F10 tumor xenografts. SSOs were delivered in vivo using lipid nanoparticles. Administration of nanoparticle with Bcl-x SSO resulted in modification of Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing in lung metastases and reduced tumor load, while nanoparticle alone or formulated with a control SSO had no effect. Our findings demonstrate in vivo anti-tumor activity of SSOs that modulate Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing.",

            "text": "Over 90% of multi-exon pre-mRNA transcripts undergo alternative splicing (1) and up to one-half of disease-causing mutations affect splicing (2). Thus, in addition to its significant contribution to proteome diversity, alternative splicing constitutes an important therapeutic target (3). Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) modulate alternative splicing by hybridizing to pre-mRNA sequences involved in splicing and blocking access by various splicing factors (4,5). Unlike siRNA and traditional antisense approaches, which lead to RNA degradation by RISC and RNase H-mediated cleavage, respectively, direction of pre-mRNA splicing requires that the SSO-targeted RNA is not degraded. This is achieved by altering the oligonucleotide sugar-phosphate backbone as in, for example, the 2 0 -O-methoxyethyl (MOE) ribose modification (6,7). In order to realize their full therapeutic utility, SSOs must be efficiently delivered to the pharmacological site of action in vivo (8). This can be achieved by exploiting the inherent pharmacodynamic properties of the SSO chemistry (9,10), conjugation of cell penetrating peptides (11)(12)(13), and the use of nanoparticle carriers (14). As a result, in vivo efficacy has been established for SSOs in animal models of inflammatory disease, b-thalassemia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) [For a recent review, see (15)], and early phase clinical trials using SSOs to treat DMD have yielded promising results (16,17).",

Through alternative splicing, the Bcl-x gene yields two major protein isoforms with opposing functions, anti-apoptotic Bcl-x L and pro-apoptotic Bcl-x S (18)  (Figure 1A). Bcl-x L is upregulated in a number of cancers and confers resistance to a broad range of chemotherapeutic drugs (19). Bcl-x S antagonizes the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-x L and another antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2 (20,21). Redirection of Bcl-x splicing from Bcl-x L to -x S induced apoptosis and increased chemosensitivity in cancer cells in culture (22)(23)(24); however, the anti-tumor effect of this strategy remains to be demonstrated in vivo.",

Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis and disease progression is associated with increased Bcl-x L expression (25,26) . Xenografts of murine B16F10 melanoma cells provide a good model of this aggressive cancer because they express Bcl-x L and are syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice, obviating the need for immunocompromised animals and providing a more realistic environment for drug testing. In this model, B16F10 murine melanoma cells localize to the lungs shortly after injection into the tail vein, providing a concise and predictable experimental time-course. In addition, the cell line used here expressed luciferase, providing an easily quantified measure of the tumor load. We previously failed to detect activity of systemically-delivered free SSOs in tumor xenografts. Thus, for this work we employed a liposome-DNApolycation (LPD) nanoparticle (NP) formulation designed by the Huang laboratory (27)(28)(29), which delivered siRNA to tumor cells in the B16F10 xenograft model (30,31). In previous work, Huang and colleagues demonstrated enhanced tumor cell-specific uptake of this NP formulation by surface-modification with anisamide, a ligand of the sigma receptor, which is upregulated in many cancers (32,33) and is expressed in B16F10 cells (27,30,31,34).",

Consistent with these results, probing of total protein from treated cells with anti-Bcl-x antibody showed SSO-dependent reduction in the level Bcl-x L protein ( Figure 2C). We were unable to detect the expected Bcl-x S protein because the endogenous level of murine Bcl-x S expression was below the threshold required by available antibodies (Supplementary Figure S1). Importantly, SSO treatment resulted also in a dose-dependant decrease in cell viability, as evidenced by a clonogenic cell death assay ( Figure 3A). This was accompanied by cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), indicating that the observed cell death was due to apoptosis ( Figure 3B). These effects were absent in untreated and mock-transfected cells, and cells transfected with a control SSO. In addition, the Bcl-x SSO had no effect on the pre-mRNA splicing of Mcl-1, a closely related gene that shares sequence homology at the 5 0 -splice site, supporting sequence specificity of the Bcl-x SSO (Supplementary Figure S2).",

            "text": "To facilitate SSO delivery to cancer cells in tumor-bearing mice, an LPD NP developed by the Huang laboratory was used (30,31). The SSO and a carrier DNA (calf thymus DNA) were complexed by protamine into a compact core which was then coated with cationic lipids to form the NP (Figure 4). The surface of the NP was further modified with an anisamide ligand-conjugated polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid for targeting the sigma receptor-expressing B16F10 cells. This NP formulation could efficiently, specifically and with low toxicity deliver siRNA to tumor cells in the B16F10 tumor model, as shown earlier (30,31). B16F10 murine melanoma cells localize in the lungs shortly after injection into the tail vein of C57BL/6 mice. In the absence of treatment, the mice die $22 days following inoculation (30). This rapid course of disease dictated the treatment protocol ('Materials and Methods' section). RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from the tumor-bearing lungs of animals euthanized on Day 7 showed induction of Bcl-x S mRNA expression in animals treated with the Bcl-x SSO NP formulation. This effect was dose-dependant, as increasing the number of injections resulted in a greater degree of Bcl-x splice-switching from Bcl-x L to Bcl-x S mRNA in the tumor nodules ( Supplementary Figure S3). In contrast, Bcl-x S mRNA levels in animals treated with control SSO NP formulation or free SSO were no different than in animals treated with PBS only ( Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure S4). Modification of Bcl-x splicing in the liver was barely detectable in Bcl-x SSO NP-treated animals and undetectable in animals treated with control SSO NP or PBS only ( Figure 5A). As a measure of tumor load, luciferase activity was assayed in lysates from tumor-bearing lungs of animals euthanized on Day 17. A dramatic reduction in luciferase activity was seen in animals treated with Bcl-x SSO NP compared to animals treated with NP only, control SSO NP, or PBS only ( Figure 5B and C). Statistical analysis (ANOVA, Tukey's post-test) revealed that the reduction in luciferase activity in animals treated with Bcl-x SSO NP was significant compared to animals treated with PBS only (P < 0.001), NP only (P < 0.05) and control SSO NP (P < 0.05) ( Figure 5B).",

This finding is consistent with our in vitro data, as well as previous work in prostate and breast cancer cells (22,23). Interestingly, in this model both in cell culture and in vivo xenografts, modification of Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing alone induced cell death, whereas in non-small cell lung carcinoma (A549) cells adjuvant chemotherapy was needed (24).

Our cell culture data are consistent with the predicted SSO mechanism of action. Namely, that Bcl-x SSO-induced modulation of Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing reduced the level of Bcl-x L, and increased the level of Bcl-x S splice variants, causing apoptosis of cancer cells. This is evident at the RNA level, and is further supported by the dramatic reduction of Bcl-x L protein and by induction of PARP cleavage ( Figure 2C, 3C). Although SSO induced Bcl-x S mRNA, we were unable to confirm concomitant production of Bcl-x S protein by immunoblotting procedures. This was in spite of screening several commercially available antibodies and including attempts to concentrate the protein by immunoprecipitation prior to western analysis. This is likely because the maximum level of endogenous Bcl-x S protein that could be induced by the SSO was below that which could be detected by available antibodies (Supplementary Figure S1).",

Yet this treatment led to marked reduction of tumor load in treated animals. Two interpretations of these results are possible. One, that in vivo even a minor reduction of Bcl-x L levels and concomitant increase in Bcl-x S , leads to death of cancer cells or at least inhibits their proliferation. However, it is also possible that the cells which took up the SSO more efficiently were more effectively killed by apoptosis and thus eliminated from the tissue subjected to subsequent analysis. If this is the case, RT-PCR underestimates the actual level of SSO-induced splice-switching.",

For example, the small molecule ABT-737 binds Bcl-2, Bcl-x L and Bcl-w proteins with nanomolar affinity. It induced apoptosis in lymphoma and small-cell lung carcinoma cells in culture, and caused tumor regression and improved survival in preclinical studies (43). By modifying the splicing pattern of Bcl-x, the SSO can  be thought of as prompting the tumor cell to produce an endogenous BH3 mimetic, Bcl-x S , capable of antagonizing Bcl-2 and Bcl-x L and promoting apoptosis.",

We did not observe significant Bcl-x splice-switching in the liver ( Figure 5A), and ALT and AST serum levels of the treatment groups was within the normal range ( Figure 6A and  B). This suggests that liver uptake of the NP was limited and did not translate into significant biological activity or toxicity. In some tumor-bearing, control mice AST and AST values were >100 U/L suggesting that this could be a rare response to tumor burden. We did detect a modest elevation of serum IL-12 levels in NP treatment groups relative to the PBS control ( Figure 6C). A previous report with the LPD NP showed more pronounced induction of inflammatory toxicity at doses !1.2 mg/kg (29,30). However, that study analyzed local toxicity from lung lysate, whereas we analyzed serum from systemic circulation. It is unclear whether this small but statistically significant increase is biologically relevant. Elevated IL-12 could be due to unmethylated CpG motifs present in the calf thymus DNA component of the NP. While we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed IL-12 increase contributed to the antitumor effect of the Bcl-x SSO, this seems unlikely because IL-12 induction was observed in all NP treatment groups, whereas reduction of tumor load was only evident in animals treated with the Bcl-x SSO.",

The LPH formulation delivered siRNA in vivo with potency similar to that of the LPD formulation; however, induction of both IL-6 and IL-12 cytokines by LPH was significantly lower than that of the corresponding LPD containing the calf thymus DNA. The LPH NP formulation could be employed for delivery of SSOs and other antisense therapeutics to tumors in future studies.",
