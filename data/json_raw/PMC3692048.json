            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNA molecules that regulate gene expression through mRNA degradation and/or translation repression, affecting many biological processes. DIANA-microT web server (http://www.microrna.gr/webServer) is dedicated to miRNA target prediction/functional analysis, and it is being widely used from the scientific community, since its initial launch in 2009. DIANA-microT v5.0, the new version of the microT server, has been significantly enhanced with an improved target prediction algorithm, DIANA-microT-CDS. It has been updated to incorporate miRBase version 18 and Ensembl version 69. The in silico-predicted miRNA-gene interactions in Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans exceed 11 million in total. The web server was completely redesigned, to host a series of sophisticated workflows, which can be used directly from the on-line web interface, enabling users without the necessary bioinformatics infrastructure to perform advanced multi-step functional miRNA analyses. For instance, one available pipeline performs miRNA target prediction using different thresholds and meta-analysis statistics, followed by pathway enrichment analysis. DIANA-microT web server v5.0 also supports a complete integration with the Taverna Workflow Management System (WMS), using the in-house developed DIANA-Taverna Plug-in. This plug-in provides ready-to-use modules for miRNA target prediction and functional analysis, which can be used to form advanced high-throughput analysis pipelines.",

Early miRNA-related research efforts have highlighted the necessity of computational analyses in order to assist the experimental identification of miRNA targets. This has resulted to the development of numerous miRNA target prediction algorithms (4), which are now considered indispensable for the design of relevant experiments. These algorithms identify in silico miRNA targets as candidates for further experimentation or for computational processing, such as target enrichment analyses. Predictions of the available computational algorithms can be acquired from relevant interaction databases or web servers (4,5).",

Further details on the microT-CDS algorithm and the utilized training sets can be found in the relevant publication by Reczko et al. (7).

These techniques provide great numbers of differentially expressed miRNAs and genes, which have to be analysed in sophisticated pipelines. The new DIANA-microT web server aims to further increase the target prediction accuracy and usability of the server interface, while facilitating users aiming to perform complex miRNA-related analyses.",

The Taverna Plug-in and the integration of cutting-edge workflows in the web interface provide the missing link between experimental results and state-of-the-art functional meta-analyses.  Flowchart depicting an analysis pipeline directly available from the web server interface. Interactions between user-defined miRNA and gene sets are in silico identified in 3 0 UTR and CDS regions using DIANA-microT-CDS. A subsequent miRNA target enrichment analysis identifies miRNAs controlling significantly the sets of differentially expressed genes. The pipeline is automatically repeated for different prediction thresholds (from more sensitive, to more stringent). By using meta-analysis statistics, the server combines the P-values from each repetition into a total P-value for each miRNA, signifying its effect on the selected genes for all used thresholds. In the last step of the pipeline, miRNA-targeted pathway analysis is implemented with DIANA-miRPath v2.",
