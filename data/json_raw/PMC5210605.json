RNALocate is a web-accessible database that aims to provide a high-quality RNA subcellular localization resource and facilitate future researches on RNA function or structure. The current version of RNALocate documents more than 37 700 manually curated RNA subcellular localization entries with experimental evidence, involving more than 21 800 RNAs with 42 subcellular localizations in 65 species, mainly including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae etc. Besides, RNA homology, sequence and interaction data have also been integrated into RNALocate. Users can access these data through online search, browse, blast and visualization tools. In conclusion, RNALocate will be of help in elucidating the entirety of RNA subcellular localization, and developing new prediction methods.

A cell is divided into different compartments that are related to different biological processes (3). For example, the RNA localized in nuclear usually participates in gene expression regulation or mitosis etc (4). Thus, the cellular role of the RNA after synthesis could be inferred from its subcellular localization information. Based on this, subcellular localization for RNAs plays an important role in studying biological function of RNAs. Therefore, it is urgent to construct a database of RNA subcellular localization to integrate, analyze and predict RNA subcellular localization for speeding up RNA structural and functional research.",

They had led to a more comprehensive understanding of the biological functions in proteins. However, recent development has indicated that protein subcellular localization are perhaps only half of the story in cells, since an expanding catalog of diverse RNAs is actively involved in multiple biological processes in different subcellular localization. To complement with this absence, we developed the RNALocate database by organizing and presenting RNA subcellular localization data for 65 organisms across 9 RNA categories. To our knowledge, this is the first database comprehensively focusing on RNA subcellular localization. We hope this resource will bridge the gap in RNAs and subcellular localization research, and stimulate further interesting elucidating the entirety of RNA subcellular localization, and developing new prediction methods. In the future, we will continuously collate RNA subcellular localization reference data and update RNALocate.",
