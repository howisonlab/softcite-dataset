            "text": "Objective: Lipid peroxides and their reactive aldehyde derivatives (LPPs) have been linked to obesity-related pathologies, but whether they have a causal role has remained unclear. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) is a selenoenzyme that selectively neutralizes lipid hydroperoxides, and human gpx4 gene variants have been associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease in epidemiological studies. This study tested the hypothesis that LPPs underlie cardio-metabolic derangements in obesity using a high fat, high sucrose (HFHS) diet in gpx4 haploinsufficient mice (GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0) and in samples of human myocardium. Methods: Wild-type (WT) and GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice were fed either a standard chow (CNTL) or HFHS diet for 24 weeks, with metabolic and cardiovascular parameters measured throughout. Biochemical and immuno-histological analysis was performed in heart and liver at termination of study, and mitochondrial function was analyzed in heart. Biochemical analysis was also performed on samples of human atrial myocardium from a cohort of 103 patients undergoing elective heart surgery. Results: Following HFHS diet, WT mice displayed moderate increases in 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-adducts and carbonyl stress, and a 1.5-fold increase in GPx4 enzyme in both liver and heart, while gpx4 haploinsufficient (GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0) mice had marked carbonyl stress in these organs accompanied by exacerbated glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and liver steatosis. Although normotensive, cardiac hypertrophy was evident with obesity, and cardiac fibrosis more pronounced in obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice. Mitochondrial dysfunction manifesting as decreased fat oxidation capacity and increased reactive oxygen species was also present in obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 but not WT hearts, along with up-regulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes. Patients with diabetes and hyperglycemia exhibited significantly less GPx4 enzyme and greater HNE-adducts in their hearts, compared with age-matched non-diabetic patients. Conclusion: These findings suggest LPPs are key factors underlying cardio-metabolic derangements that occur with obesity and that GPx4 serves a critical role as an adaptive countermeasure."

            "text": "The prevalence of obesity is rapidly spreading throughout the world with over 28% of adults having a body mass index (BMI) of !25 kg/ m 2 [1,2]. In addition to the increased risk for type 2 diabetes, a growing number of studies have reported a high prevalence of cardiomyopathy in obese patients (w40% by some estimates) [3], with evident in young adult ( 35 yrs) obese/diabetic patients [5] and even children [6]. Importantly, these cardiac derangements appear in the absence of detectable coronary disease or hypertension. Together, these findings strongly indicate a need for more careful examination of potential mechanisms that underlie cardiomyopathy in obese individuals. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are continuously oxidized in vivo through both enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions [7,8], forming lipid peroxidation end products (LPPs) such as isoprostanes, isofurans, thromboxanes, and a,b-unsaturated aldehydes [9], all of which have biological effects [10e13]. These aldehydes cause post-translational modifications of proteins through Michael addition with lysines and histidines, and through covalent modification of sulfhydryl groups (e.g., cysteines) to form carbonyl adducts [14,15]. Due to this high degree of reactivity, many of these aldehydes have been proposed to be etiologic agents in disease [7,14,16e21]. 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) is a a,bunsaturated aldehyde derived from n-6 PUFA peroxidation, and HNE levels increase proportionally with ROS/RNS levels [22]. One recent report showed that HNE-modified albumin is significantly increased in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients [23]. Mitochondrial membranes are abundant with unsaturated fatty acids, which are prone to peroxidation [24e26]. The mitochondrion is also the primary source of cellular ROS, making it a major source of LPPs [27]. As a countermeasure, mitochondria contain an elaborate system of antioxidant and LPP-detoxifying enzymes. One of these is glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), which resides in the mitochondrial inner membrane (in addition to nucleus and cytosol) to specifically scavenge lipid hydroperoxides [28e30]. GPx4 is one of a few antioxidant enzymes known to neutralize both simple and complex lipid hydroperoxides (e.g., Cholesterol hydroperoxide) [31,32]. It is the only member of the GPx super-family that is indispensable during development, with embryonic lethality of GPx4 null mice occurring at stage E7. 5 [33e35]. In recent genetic and epidemiological studies, variants of gpx4 that result in diminished content and/or catalytic activity have been associated with obesity [36], cardiovascular disease [37,38] and inflammation [39,40]. However, no experimental studies to date have explored GPx4 in the context of obesity or its related pathologies, and this may be a significant oversight given the well-known association between mitochondrial-derived oxidative stress and metabolic disease [41,42]. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that LPPs are a causal factor underlying cardio-metabolic derangements in obesity by investigating the effect of a long-term high fat, high sucrose (HFHS) diet in a mouse model of gpx4 haploinsufficiency (GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 ) and in samples of human atrial myocardium obtained from non-diabetic and diabetic patients undergoing elective heart surgery.",

            "text": "To test our hypothesis that LPPs underlie obesity-related pathologies we used a GPx4-deficient (GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 ) mouse model. GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice are phenotypically indistinguishable from WT in the absence of an exogenous stressor but more susceptible to damage from radiation and environmental toxicants [43,44]. The rationale for using this mouse model was that it mimics the effect of previously identified gpx4 gene variants on GPx4 enzyme levels and activity in human cells [36,38,45]. Following HFHS diet no significant differences in adiposity or weight gain were observed between WT and GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice, although obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice had substantial dyslipidemia and fasting hyperglycemia with HFHS diet (Table 1). Whole body energy expenditure, determined by VO2 and VCO2 using indirect calorimetry, was not different between WT and GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice, either with CNTL or HFHS diet (data not shown). Glucose intolerance was exacerbated in the GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice compared with WT ( Figure 1A), although serum insulin levels were increased with HFHS diet to equal extent regardless of genotype ( Figure 1B). GPx4 enzyme levels in liver of WT mice increased significantly as a result of HFHS diet, although GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice contain significantly less enzyme than WT ( Figure 1C and Supplemental Figure 1A). In parallel with the increase in GPx4, levels of HNEadducts in liver increased in WT with HFHS diet but were significantly more pronounced in GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice compared with WT. To determine whether the increased lipid peroxidation in the GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice corresponded to a more severe liver pathology following HFHS diet, liver triglycerides and collagen were measured by oil red O and picrosirius red staining, respectively. GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice displayed greater liver steatosis ( Figure 1D) and fibrosis ( Figure 1E) than WT mice following HFHS diet.",

Recently, in two independent experimental models of cardiac hypertrophy it was observed that GPx4 and Thioredoxin Reductase (TxnRd) were the only antioxidant seleno-enzymes to increase in the heart, suggesting that they are critical for cardiac compensatory response to hypertrophic stimuli [49,50]. A significant increase in GPx4 mRNA ( Figure 3A) and enzyme content ( Figure 3B and Supplemental Figure 1B) in myocardium of WT mice with HFHS diet was observed. Conversely, GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice had lower levels of mRNA that did not correspond to any significant change in GPx4 enzyme levels following HFHS diet. Levels of HNE-adducts ( Figure 3C) and protein carbonyls ( Figure 3C) do increase moderately in WT hearts with HFHS diet, although GPx4 deficiency leads to a striking increase in this protein carbonylation with obesity. To determine if GPx4 deficiency and augmented carbonyl stress in obesity triggered a compensatory redox adaptive response in the heart, expression of a number of antioxidant genes were examined. GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice were found to have increased expression of several antioxidant genes following HFHS diet ( Figure 3D).",

            "section": "GPx4 deficiency causes mitochondrial abnormalities and upregulation of cardiac inflammation and fibrosis signaling pathways with obesity",
            "text": "Mitochondrial dysfunction, as characterized by decreased ATP and/or respiration combined with increased ROS, has been linked to several obesity-related pathologies, including insulin resistance and cardiomyopathy, and recent studies have implicated a role for mitochondrial protein carbonylation in mediating this dysfunction [51e53]. Parameters of mitochondrial function in permeabilized LV myofibers were examined to assess the relationship between GPx4 deficiency, carbonyl stress, and mitochondria in the obese myocardium. GPx4 enzyme content was measured in the mitochondrial fraction isolated from whole hearts. GPx4 increased in cardiac mitochondria of WT mice with HFHS diet, while total levels of GPx4 were lower and remained that way following HFHS diet in the GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 4A and Supplemental Figure 2A). It was expected that mitochondrial GPx4 deficiency would potentially lead to a greater degree of mitochondrial membrane lipid peroxidation and reactive aldehyde formation. Here, the amount of mitochondrial HNE-adducts were greater in GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 hearts than WT, and the HFHS diet increased the relative amount of these adducts in both WT and GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 4B and Supplemental Figure 2B). These increased HNE-adducts may have functional consequences since recent studies have documented that mitochondrial HNE-adducts correspond to decreased oxidative phosphorylation in diabetic heart mitochondria [74,75]. Moreover, another report highlights the importance of mitochondrial fatty acid b-oxidation as a metabolic 'sink' for HNE [72]. In WT hearts, both basal and maximal ADP-stimulated palmitoyl-L-carnitine supported respiration was markedly increased following HFHS diet, while these rates were unchanged with HFHS diet in the GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 4B). In a previous study we reported that the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase-2 (TxnRd2) increased in rat heart with HFHS diet [54], corresponding to a decreased rate of mitochondrial H 2 O 2 emission in the obese rat heart. Other groups have also reported decreased mitochondrial ROS with obesity/diabetes in mouse [55] and rat models [56]. Given our previous findings, combined with the fact that TxnRd2 expression was increased in GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 hearts with HFHS diet ( Figure 3E), we sought to ascertain whether a similar adaptation in redox buffering was occurring in cardiac mitochondria of these mice. Here, using paired H 2 O 2 emission experiments in the absence and presence of the TxnRd2 inhibitor auranofin, a dramatic (w4-fold) increase in total H 2 O 2 emission was observed in permeabilized myofibers prepared from obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice fed HFHS diet, while a decrease in this ROS emission was observed in the obese WT mice following HFHS diet ( Figure 4C). Auranofin exposure significantly increased the rate of mitochondrial ROS in the obese WT mice but not obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice. Chronic, low-grade inflammation in the obese heart is known to cause profibrotic and hypertrophic signaling. Although it has been difficult to fully ascertain the exact nature of the relationship between inflammation and cardiac remodeling, some investigators have proposed that activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) may play a role. RAGE belongs to a family of pattern recognition receptors for AGE and has been studied extensively in the context of diabetes-related pathologies [57,58]. Increased expression of RAGE is present in the hearts of obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 5A), and this is consistent with the increased carbonyl stress present in these hearts since reactive aldehydes such as HNE are known to potentiate AGE formation [59]. Activation of RAGE has been shown to induce chronic activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB), which, in turn, activates further inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, there is extensive crosstalk between the RAGE and Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-b) family of proteins [60e62]. Notably, the hearts of obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice also displayed greater proinflammatory cytokine expression and genes involved in fibrosis and hypertrophy compared with WT following HFHS diet, while only a modest increase in a few select genes was observed with HFHS diet in WT hearts ( Figure 5A & B).",

In a small pilot study of w20 patients, we previously reported greater levels of HNE-protein adducts in the hearts of hyperglycemic type 2 diabetic patients, and these increased HNEadducts were accompanied by depletion of cardiac glutathione and increased mitochondrial ROS production [63]. Here, using samples of atrial myocardium obtained from patients (n \u00bc 103) undergoing elective cardiac surgery (Table 2), we observed that diabetic patients had significantly less cardiac GPx4 than non-diabetic patients ( Figure 6A), and this corresponded with greater levels of HNE-adducts in the diabetic hearts ( Figure 6B). A multivariable regression analysis was performed on quartiles of cardiac GPx4 and tertiles of HNEadducts, and cardiac GPx4 was found to be negatively associated while HNE-adducts positively associated with RR for diabetes in these patients ( Table 3). To determine if hyperglycemia was associated with cardiac GPx4 or HNE-adducts in these patients, a multiple linear regression model was applied, adjusting for sex. No significant association between cardiac GPx4 or HNE-adduct levels and HbA1c was observed in these patients ( Table 3 and Supplemental Figure 1). Similar to what was observed with the WT-HFHS mice, cardiac GPx4 content was positively correlated with cardiac HNE-adducts in these patients ( Figure 6C), suggesting that GPx4 is an adaptive response of   Original article the tissue to persistent oxidative stress. Interestingly, the ratio of HNEadducts/GPx4 was much higher in diabetic than non-diabetic hearts ( Figure 6D), indicating that the GPx4 adaptive response has been overwhelmed or compromised in these patients.",

Lipid peroxides and their reactive aldehyde derivatives have been postulated to play a causal role in obesity-related cardio-metabolic diseases, and emerging epidemiologic data has reported a link between polymorphisms and mutations in gpx4 and human diseases, including obesity. Together, these previous findings suggest that GPx4 may be an adaptive component that serves a protective role against the persistent oxidative stress in obesity. The present study tested this hypothesis in a translational model of HFHS diet-induced obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 (i.e. GPx4 deficient) mice, combined with cardiac tissue samples obtained from patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. The findings from this study demonstrate that GPx4 deficiency with diet-induced obesity leads to significant increases in lipid peroxide-derived aldehydes, corresponding to more severe cardio-metabolic derangements including glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, liver steatosis, and cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Abnormalities in mitochondrial function in hearts from the obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice implicate a role for the enzyme in protecting that critical organelle from oxidative damage in obesity."

Lastly, the relationship between decreased cardiac GPx4 and increased HNEadducts and human metabolic disease was confirmed by studying cardiac tissue samples obtained from non-diabetic and diabetic patients. Collectively, these observations allow for a proposed model of GPx4 as a protective adaptation in obesity (as shown in the Graphical Abstract). Clearly, when lipid peroxidation increases as a result of persistent oxidative stress in obesity/nutrient overload, GPx4 is upregulated to compensate (Figures 1 and 3). However, over time and possibly due to underlying genetic causes, GPx4 becomes overwhelmed in an obese individual and HNE-adducts increase (along with numerous other LPPs that were not measured in this study). The consequence of this is increased inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction (and likely potentiation of mitochondrial ROS), and the broad cardio-metabolic pathologies that are known to follow (e.g., diabetes, cardiomyopathy, liver disease). These findings stand in contrast to preceding studies of diet-induced obesity in antioxidant-deficient models. One recent study of high fatfed GPx1-deficient mice (whole body GPx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) found that systemic oxidative stress increased with obesity as expected, but these mice were actually protected from insulin resistance and liver steatosis [98].",

            "text": "In a study using high fat diet in SOD2 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice (also exhibiting greater oxidative stress), insulin sensitivity was again unchanged with obesity, although a modest effect on pancreatic b-cell release of insulin was observed [99]. Another intriguing study used high fat diet in a glutathione-deficient (Gclm\u00c0/\u00c0) mouse model. The authors found that despite a huge increase in systemic oxidative stress with the diet, these mice were also protected from increased adiposity, insulin resistance and steatosis, possibly due to an increase in basal energy expenditure [100]. Given these recent findings, the fact that GPx4 haploinsufficiency alone can induce such a damaging effect on cardiometabolic parameters with HFHS diet implies that lipid peroxides and their LPP derivatives are a distinctive form of oxidative stress that must play a very prominent etiological role in obesity-related cardio-metabolic diseases. Deleterious effects of lipid-derived aldehydes in biological systems have been well known for many years. For example, nucleophilic attack of cysteine residues by aldehydes has negative ramifications on metabolic pathways in the cell [14,64]. A recent mass spectrometric analysis of cysteine oxidation status in hearts from mice fed a diabetogenic diet for 8 months showed that w40% of total oxidized cysteines are mitochondrial in origin [65]. Proteomic analysis of mitochondria from diabetic rat hearts reveals an increased formation of carbonyl adducts (e.g. HNE, MDA) with complexes of the electron transport chain and respiratory complexes, and these adducts correspond to a reduction in enzyme activity [18]. Our data suggest that GPx4 protects against cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction with obesity as the obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice had very high levels of carbonyl stress in their hearts (Figure 3), particularly HNE-adducts in the cardiac mitochondria ( Figure 4B), accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, as compared with obese WT mice. Several studies have shown that GPx4 preserves ATP production and attenuates cytochrome c release in the mitochondria under oxidative stress [66e68]. Cardiac-specific overexpression of mitochondrial GPx4 is protective in models of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury and in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model [69,70]. GPx4 exists as both short (i.e., mitochondriallocalized) and long (i.e., cytosolic-localized) isoforms, yet only deletion of the former is lethal in mice [67]. Thioredoxin Reductase is the only other essential selenoenzyme identified to date, and this enzyme also has both mitochondrial (TxnRd2) and cytosolic (TxnRd1) isoforms [71].",

Considering the diminished rates of maximal palmitoyl carnitine-supported respiration observed in the obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 hearts, it is plausible that the elevated carbonyl stress observed in the hearts of these mice is a result of both increased mitochondrial ROS production (which initiates more lipid peroxidation) as well as a disruption of aldehyde detoxification pathways. The decreased GPx4 and correspondingly increased HNE-adducts seen here in myocardium of diabetic patients support our previous observations of decreased palmitoyl-L-carnitine supported respiration and increased mitochondrial ROS in diabetic human hearts [42,73]. A link between mitochondrial HNE-adduct formation and decreased oxidative phosphorylation in diabetic heart mitochondria has recently been made [74,75], and our findings suggest that GPx4 deficiency may underlie these oxidative modifications. High variability in dietary fat may also be a contributor to the greater levels of cardiac HNE-adducts in the diabetic patients, as it has been reported that diets consisting of high fat mixed with carbohydrate, or high fat alone, can lead to drastically   different outcomes in HNE accumulation in oxidative tissues [101].",

            "text": "Other studies directed at examining the role that alternative aldehydeproducing (e.g., monoamine oxidase) and detoxifying enzymes (e.g., aldehyde dehydrogenases) may have in pathologies of obese/diabetic hearts may also be useful [64]. In addition, an improved understanding of the regulation of selenocysteine status may serve as a major clue to uncovering the mechanisms that govern the progression to maladaptive remodeling in hearts of patients with metabolic disease. Epidemiological studies of Keshan's disease, a cardiomyopathy endemic to regions of China, confirm that the heart is highly susceptible to injury resulting from disturbances to selenocysteine enzymes. Cardiomyopathy in Keshan's disease manifests as acute cardiac fibrosis and mitochondrial dysfunction [76], a phenotype that is strikingly similar to the GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice in the present study. Aside from measurements of liver steatosis and serum lipids, our study did not explore the potential contribution of altered lipid metabolism that might exist in these mice. Lipotoxicity is a consistent feature of cardio-metabolic disease in both humans and animal models of obesity [77e82] and therefore may contribute to the severe liver and cardiac pathology observed in the obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice. The obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice do not possess significantly greater adiposity than obese WT, as determined by % body fat. However, we cannot exclude that there may have been differences in adipose distribution between groups. It is also known that GPx4 directly modulates the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase II enzyme systems, and, when viewed in this context, the increased cardiac inflammation present in obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice supports a potential role for prostaglandins and other oxidized lipids in mediating the severe metabolic pathologies in this model. Thus, we cannot exclude the contribution of these mediators in the obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 mice. Other studies have documented that proteolysis and autophagy become compromised with carbonyl stress, and the diminished activity of these cellular processes may also explain the more severe phenotype observed in the obese GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 hearts [83,84]. None of these alternative pathways were explored in the present study. It is anticipated that these findings will serve to lay a foundation for future mechanistic studies directed at understanding how LPPs contribute to obesity-related pathologies and the adaptive role of GPx4.",

Furthermore, our findings have clinical implications as they suggest that patients exhibiting decreased GPx4 expression and activity might be predisposed to obesity-related cardio-metabolic diseases. Indeed, clinical studies and human cell models have shown that GPx4 expression and activity vary widely in response to environmental and nutritional cues [38,45,85e88]. Finally, although our understanding of the role of lipid-derived aldehydes and carbonyl stress in the etiology of obesity-related diseases is in its infancy, it is important to recognize that compounds that scavenge HNE and other lipid-derived aldehydes specifically, such as histidine-containing dipeptides, may be very useful in this regard [89,90,102] and have experienced some success in pre-clinical testing and even clinical trials [91e93]. Thus, further research into novel therapeutics targeting carbonyl stress will be important for mitigating the numerous cardiometabolic diseases that accompany this rising epidemic of obesity.",

At 8e12 weeks, WT and GPx4 \u00fe/\u00c0 male and female age-matched littermates (n \u00bc 6) were randomly assigned to groups and individually housed. Mice were fed either control (CNTL-TD110367) or high fat high sucrose (HFHS-TD110365) diet from Harlan-Teklad Laboratories (Madison, WI) ad libidum for 25 weeks. The composition of this diet was a special formulation consisting of mixed saturated and n-6 PUFA (44.6% kcal/g fat), with high sucrose (34% kcal/g) content [54]. Mice were housed at controlled temperature and a 12hr light/dark cycle was maintained. At the end of the diet period, all live animal metabolic and echocardiographic measurements were made 1e2 weeks prior to tissue collection to allow for a 'washout period' to minimize artifact attributable to additional stress that may have been introduced by these procedures.",
