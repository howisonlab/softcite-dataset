            "text": "Memory CD8 + T cells are generated after an immune response dependent on suitable TCR, costimulatory, and cytokine signals (Kaech and Cui, 2012). However, naive CD8 + T cells can also acquire the phenotypic and functional traits of memory cells in the absence of stimulation by foreign antigens through responses to homeostatic cues (Lee et al., 2011;Sprent and Surh, 2011;Jameson et al., 2015). This pathway was initially observed in the context of the proliferative response made by naive CD8 + T cells in lymphopenic conditions, but such cells are also generated under normal homeostatic conditions (Sprent and Surh, 2011;Jameson et al., 2015). The homeostatic cytokines IL-7 and IL-15 play an important role in inducing and perpetuating these innate or homeostatic memory CD8 + T cells, but recent studies indicated an unexpected role for IL-4. Specifically, mice that develop a prominent population of IL-4-producing NK T cells show the generation of abundant memory-like CD8 + T cells (Lee et al., 2011;Jameson et al., 2015). The generation of these memory-like cells (which have been termed innate or bystander memory CD8 + T cells) requires that CD8 + T cells be intrinsically responsive to IL-4 (Weinreich et al., 2009;Lee et al., 2011;Jameson et al., 2015). Although IL-4 is best known as a prototypical feature of the Th2 responses, the innate memory CD8 + T cells produced in response to IL-4 were found to exhibit Tc1 properties, including the ability to rapidly produce IFN-\u03b3 (Weinreich et al., 2009(Weinreich et al., , 2010Lai et al., 2011). Although originally identified in genetically manipulated C57BL/6 mice, this pathway was also observed in normal mouse strains, most prominently the BALB/c strain (Weinreich et al., 2010;Lee et al., 2013b).",

In contrast, innate memory CD8 + T cells produced in C57BL/6 mice, which have low steady-state IL-4 levels, are rare in the thymus, and this population appears first in peripheral lymphoid tissues (Akue et al., 2012). Second, IL-4-induced memory CD8 + T cells show striking up-regulation of the transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) but not the related T-box factor, T-bet (Weinreich et al., 2009;Gordon et al., 2011;Lai et al., 2011;Lee et al., 2011). In contrast, memory-like CD8 + T cells generated in C57BL/6 mice express both Eomes and T-bet, similarly to antigen-driven memory CD8 + T cells (Lee et al., 2013a). How these differences influence the functional response of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells remains unclear.",

However, the antigen specificity and functional properties of these cells is poorly defined. In this study, we show that IL-4 regulates not only the frequency and function of innate memory CD8 + T cells, but also regulates Eomes expression levels and functional reactivity of naive CD8 + T cells. Lack of IL-4 responsiveness attenuates the capacity of CD8 + T cells to mount a robust response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, with both quantitative and qualitative effects on effector and memory antigen-specific CD8 + T cells. Unexpectedly, we found that, although numerically rare, memory phenotype CD8 + T cells in IL-4R\u03b1-deficient mice exhibited enhanced reactivity after in vitro and in vivo stimulation. Importantly, our data revealed that these effects of IL-4 exposure occur before, not during, infection. Together, these data show that IL-4 influences the entire peripheral CD8 + T cell pool, influencing expression of T-box transcription factors, functional reactivity, and the capacity to respond to infection. These findings indicate that IL-4, a canonical Th2 cell cytokine, can sometimes promote rather than impair Th1 cell-type immune responses.",

This is important to assess because some studies have shown that memory phenotype CD8 + T cells generated through homeostatic mechanisms act by inhibiting rather than enhancing the T cell immune response (Rifa'i et al., 2004;Lin et al., 2007;Dai et al., 2010;Kim et al., 2010Kim et al., , 2011Sakuraba et al., 2013). Here, we show that responsiveness to IL-4 during CD8 + T cell development and homeostasis leads to diverse changes in functional response and gene expression not only of memory phenotype CD8 + T cells, but also of naive CD8 + T cells. Although IL-4R\u03b1-deficient memory phenotype CD8 + T cells exhibited low Eomes expression, our data unexpectedly revealed that these cells had enhanced capacity to produce inflammatory cytokines in vitro and expand to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in vivo. These data suggest that a lack of IL-4 sensitivity chiefly compromises the numbers rather than intrinsic function of memory-like cells. Through adoptive transfer studies, we could also show that sensitivity to IL-4 encounter during the response to LCMV was not necessary to support an effective CD8 + T cell response, suggesting that the impact of IL-4 is primarily through its effects on CD8 + T cell development and homeostasis. Collectively, our results indicate that IL-4 has diverse effects on the phenotype and function of the whole peripheral CD8 + T cell population and that IL-4 responsiveness enhances the CD8 + T cell response to pathogens.",

However, it is less clear whether and how IL-4 reactivity affects the peripheral pool of memory phenotype CD8 + T cells. We initially compared the CD8 + T cell pools from spleen and lymph nodes of naive WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO BALB/cByJ mice. Although the total numbers of lympho-cytes were similar ( Fig. 1 A), IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice exhibited a decreased frequency of CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1 B), leading to reduced numbers of CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1 C). Preliminary studies indicated total lymphocyte numbers in IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice were normalized by an increased frequency of B cells (not depicted). Using CD44 and CXCR3 surface expression as markers (Ventre et al., 2012), we differentiated the CD8 + T cell pool into three populations: naive phenotype (CD44 lo CXR3 lo ), memory phenotype (CD44 hi CXCR3 hi ), and an intermediate phenotype (CD44 hi CXCR3 lo ) population (gating shown in Fig. 1 D). IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice had decreased frequencies of memory phenotype CD8 + T cells in the periphery, with reciprocal increased frequencies of naive phenotype cells, compared with WT ( Fig. 1 E). These differences resulted in a substantial decrease in memory phenotype CD8 + T cell numbers (and slightly fewer intermediate cells), whereas the number of naive CD8 + T cells increased in IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice (Fig. 1 F). To determine whether the impact of IL-4 responsiveness was cell extrinsic or intrinsic, we generated mixed BM chimeras, in which congenically distinct IL-4R\u03b1 KO and WT BM cells were coinjected to reconstitute lethally irradiated hosts. As in the intact mice, the frequency of memory phenotype CD8 + T cells was significantly reduced in the IL-4R\u03b1 KO donor population, whereas naive phenotype CD8 + T cells frequencies were increased (Fig. 1 G), demonstrating that these effects reflect a cell-intrinsic role for IL-4R\u03b1 on CD8 + T cells (as was found for thymic IL-4-induced memory phenotype CD8 + T cells [Weinreich et al., 2009]).",

We and others have shown that a significant fraction of C57BL/6 CD8 + T cells specific for varied foreign antigens exhibit a memory phenotype despite no previous exposure to those antigens; this population of innate memory cells has also been called virtual memory CD8 + T cells (Haluszczak et al., 2009;La Gruta et al., 2010). This population was only modestly reduced in IL-4-or IL-4R\u03b1deficient C57BL/6 mice (Akue et al., 2012;Sosinowski et al., 2013), but it was unclear whether the much larger population of IL-4-dependent memory-like cells in BALB/c mice included virtual memory cells. To address this, we performed tetramer enrichment assays to isolate antigen-specific CD8 + T cell populations in unimmunized WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO BALB/c mice. Total numbers of CD8 + T cells specific for the L d -restricted LCMV nucleoprotein 118-126 (NP 118-126 ) epitope and the K d -restricted Listeria monocytogenes listeriolysin O 91-99 (LLO 91-99 ) epitope were modestly reduced in IL-4R\u03b1-deficient BALB/c mice (Fig. 2, A and C). On resolution of phenotypic subsets, it became apparent that the numbers of foreign antigen-specific naive CD8 + T cells were not significantly changed in unimmunized WT and IL-4R\u03b1-deficient mice but that numbers of both memory and intermediate phenotype cells were reduced in the IL-4R\u03b1 KO animals (Fig. 2, B and D). Similar findings were observed when L d /NP 118-126 -specific CD8 + T cells were characterized from the spleens of WT, IL-4R\u03b1 KO, and IL-4 KO animals (not depicted). These results indicate that our findings for the bulk CD8 + T cell pool also apply to precursors specific for unencountered antigens. Together, these results indicate that IL-4R\u03b1 expression by CD8 + T cells is important for the generation and/or maintenance of innate memory phenotype CD8 + T cells in peripheral tissues.",

            "text": "The T-box transcription factors T-bet and Eomes play a crucial role in activated CD8 + T cell fate and function. Antigeninduced memory CD8 + T cells and innate memory CD8 + T cells in C57BL/6 mice express both Eomes and T-bet (Lee et al., 2013a). In contrast, the thymic innate memory population in BALB/c mice is characterized by high Eomes expression and low T-bet expression (Weinreich et al., 2010). It is unclear, however, whether this Eomes hi , T-bet lo phenotype is a unique feature of thymic innate memory phenotype CD8 + T cells and how IL-4 responsiveness impacts T-box factor expression by naive and memory phenotype peripheral CD8 + T cells in BALB/c mice. Hence, we measured expression of Eomes and T-bet by CD8 + T cells from the spleen and lymph nodes of WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO BALB/cByJ mice ( Fig. 3 A). As we reported for thymic innate memory CD8 + T cells (Weinreich et al., 2010), BALB/c peripheral memory phenotype CD8 + T cells were Eomes hi and T-bet lo . In contrast, IL-4R\u03b1 deficiency resulted in reduced Eomes and elevated T-bet expression by memory phenotype cells. Unexpectedly, analysis of IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice also revealed reduced Eomes expression (and moderately increased T-bet expression) in the naive and intermediate phenotype CD8 + T cell populations (Fig. 3, B and C). This conclusion was supported when Eomes hi and Eomes lo peaks were analyzed separately; Eomes expression levels were higher in WT versus IL-4R\u03b1 KO CD8 + T cells within these populations (not depicted). It was possible that IL-4R\u03b1dependent Eomes expression by CD8 + T cell subsets was not caused by IL-4 sensitivity by CD8 + T cells themselves. Hence, we again examined mixed BM chimeras (as in Fig. 1) and found that Eomes expression was highly dependent on IL-4R\u03b1 expression by CD8 + T cells (Fig. 3 D), indicating a CD8 + T cell-intrinsic role of IL-4 sensitivity. Again, measuring the Eomes expression level after gating on Eomes hi and Eomes lo populations confirmed this conclusion (not depicted). In contrast, the elevated T-bet expression observed in CD8 + T cell subsets of intact IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice was not reliably observed in Figure 1. IL-4R\u03b1 expression is required for generation/maintenance of bystander memory CD8 + T cells in the periphery. (A-C) Combined spleen and lymph node lymphocytes from age-matched WT BALB/cByJ and IL-4R\u03b1 KO BALB/cByJ were analyzed for total lymphocyte count (A), frequency (B), and total number of CD8 + T cells (C). (D-F) As shown in D, CD8 + T cells were segregated into three populations based on CD44 and CXCR3 expression. The frequency (E) and number (F) of CD44 lo CXCR3 lo , CD44 hi CXCR3 lo , and CD44 hi CXCR3 hi CD8 + T cells was determined in WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO BALB/cByJ mice. (G) Mixed BM chimeras were generated by introducing WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO BALB/cByJ donor BM into lethally irradiated WT BALB/cByJ hosts. Chimeric mice were bled 8 wk later, and the frequency of CD8 + T cells with the indicated CD44/ CXCR3 phenotype was determined for both donor populations. Error bars indicate mean \u00b1 SD. P-values are represented as *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001 by unpaired (A-C, E, and F) or paired (G) Student's t test for BM chimeras. (A-C) Data are combined from two separate experiments (n = 9 for WT, n = 8 for IL-4R\u03b1 KO) and are representative of five experiments. (D-F) n = 4 for WT and n = 4 for IL-4R\u03b1 KO, and data are representative of five experiments. (G) n = 7 for mixed BM chimeras, and data are representative of three experiments.",

We and others previously showed that IL-4-induced memory phenotype cells in the thymus were capable of rapid IFN-\u03b3 production upon TCR stimulation; however, these studies entailed comparison with the response of IL-4 KO or IL-4R\u03b1 KO CD4 \u2212 CD8 + thymocytes, which are dominated by naive phenotype cells (Weinreich et al., 2010;Lai et al., 2011). A direct comparison between the responses of naive and memory CD8 + subsets in WT and IL-4R\u03b1-deficient BALB/c mice has not been carefully investigated. First, we stimulated bulk CD8 + T cells from peripheral lymphoid tissues of WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and assayed production of the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IFN-\u03b3. Unexpectedly, despite the increased frequency of memory phenotype CD8 + T cells in WT animals, similar frequencies of WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO CD8 + T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 at 6-and 24-h time points, and a greater proportion of IL-4R\u03b1 KO CD8 + T cells expressed TNF at 6 h (a time point chosen because this cytokine is produced early after stimulation; Fig. 4 A; Badovinac et al., 2000). These findings prompted us to study the responses of WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO CD8 + T cell subpopulations. Hence, we next sorted the three CD8 + T cell subsets (see Fig. 1) and tested their individual responses to T cell activation (Fig. 4,  B-D). Similar to the bulk populations (Fig. 4 A), IL-4R\u03b1 KO CD8 + T cells from all three subsets showed an increased frequency of TNF-producing cells compared with their WT counterparts (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, at 24 h of stimulation, we observed increased percentages of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells from all three subsets of CD8 + T cells derived from IL-4R\u03b1 KO animals relative to WT (Fig. 4 D). This result was not caused by altered kinetics of IFN-\u03b3 expression by WT versus IL-4R\u03b1-deficient populations because a significantly higher fraction of IL-4R\u03b1 KO CD8 + memory phenotype T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 even at 6 h of stimulation (a time point at which very few CXCR3 lo /CD44 hi/lo populations expressed IFN-\u03b3; Fig. 4 C).",

            "text": "The role for IL-4 in regulating the CD8 + T cell response to infection is unclear. IL-4 reactivity was proposed to be important for optimal effector (Carvalho et al., 2002) and memory (Morrot et al., 2005) CD8 + T cell responses to a mouse model of malaria. However, IL-4 signaling may inhibit polyfunctional responses to viral infection (Wijesundara et al., 2013) and may reduce activation of memory CD8 + T cells after in vitro restimulation (Ventre et al., 2012). To investigate whether IL-4 sensitivity impacted the CD8 + T cell response to infection, we infected WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice with an acute viral pathogen, LCMV Armstrong, and tracked the response of L d / NP 118-126 -specific CD8 + T cells, as well as the bulk CD8 + T cell pool. In part, we chose to follow the response to L d /NP 118-126 because, in our hands, the total numbers of antigen-specific precursors were not substantially different between WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice, whereas the numbers of nonnaive phenotype antigen-specific cells was significantly reduced (Fig. 2). WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice had similar frequencies of NP 118-126 -specific CD8 + T cells, as measured by tetramer binding (Fig. 5 A). However, we found significantly decreased numbers of total CD8 + T cells in the spleens of IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice 7 d after LCMV infection (Fig. 5 B), and accordingly, the absolute numbers of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells were reduced in IL-4R\u03b1 animals (Fig. 5 C). It is worth noting that the fold difference in bulk and antigen-specific CD8 + T cell numbers between WT and IL-4R\u03b1-deficient mice was more substantial after LCMV infection (Fig. 5, B and C) than in unimmunized mice (Figs. 1 C and 2 A), e.g., the difference in bulk CD8 + T cells before infection was 1.3-fold, whereas it was 2.2-fold after infection (Figs. 1 C and 5 B), indicating that the response to infection exacerbates the deficit in IL-4R\u03b1 KO CD8 + T cells. Because we found that IL-4 sensitivity influenced Eomes and T-bet expression in unimmunized CD8 + T cell populations (Fig. 3), we next measured intracellular expression of these factors in the antigen-specific CD8 + T cells at the effector stage of the response to LCMV. We observed decreased frequency and numbers of Eomes-expressing CD8 + T cells in IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice ( Fig. 5 D and not depicted). Although an increased frequency of IL-4R\u03b1 KO antigen-specific CD8 + T cells was either T-bet single positive or expressed low levels of both transcription factors (Fig. 5 D), this did not translate into increased absolute numbers of these populations (not depicted).",

To control for this, we conducted similar experiments in mixed BM chimeras, in which we could determine the intrinsic impact of IL-4R\u03b1 deficiency among the CD8 + T cell population. Those studies revealed that the differences in T-bet and Eomes expression held for WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO cells responding to LCMV in the same host animals, arguing for a cell-autonomous role for IL-4R\u03b1 expression in this system (Fig. 5 E).

Hence, we also investigated whether the frequency of SLEC and MPEC populations (and other CD127/KLRG1-defined subsets) differed in LCMV-infected WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice. At an effector stage time point, we observed reduced frequencies of SLEC phenotype cells and a modest increase in the frequency of MPEC phenotype cells in IL-4R\u03b1 KO animals ( Fig. 5 F), although all antigen-specific IL-4R\u03b1 KO subpopulations were decreased in absolute numbers compared with WT (not depicted).

IL-4R\u03b1-deficient mice had reduced total CD8 + T cell numbers, chiefly arising because of a severe reduction in the frequency of memory phenotype cells (including virtual memory cells specific for unencountered foreign antigens). However, beyond these quantitative effects, qualitative changes in the CD8 + T cell pool were evident. Our previous study indicates that IL-4 exposure in the thymus resulted in high expression levels of the Eomes transcription factor (but not the related factor T-bet) in thymic memory phenotype CD8 + T cells (Weinreich et al., 2010). Peripheral memory phenotype CD8 + T cells in IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice were reduced in frequency and showed reduced Eomes expression. Surprisingly, we also observed that IL-4 responsiveness correlated with heightened Eomes expression in all CD8 + T cells, including phenotypically naive CD8 + T cells. A study by Carty et al. (2014) using C57BL/6 mice suggested that naive CD8 + T cells do not up-regulate Eomes in response to IL-4 alone in vitro, but rather, Eomes could be induced by a combination Figure 6.

Hence, the elevated Eomes levels we observe in WT naive CD8 + T cells in BALB/c mice might arise because of sustained IL-4R\u03b1 signals in the periphery or potentially be carried over from IL-4R\u03b1 stimulation during thymic differentiation; whether, in either case, basal TCR stimulation through selfpeptide-MHC interactions is required to preserve Eomes expression levels is unclear.",

Although numerically reduced, IL-4R\u03b1-deficient memory phenotype CD8 + T cells showed significantly enhanced capacity to make IFN-\u03b3 and TNF compared with their WT counterparts. Furthermore, this functional superiority extended to the IL-4R\u03b1-deficient naive and intermediate phenotype populations. On a per cell basis then, acute inflammatory cytokine production is compromised rather than enhanced by developmental exposure to IL-4. This finding resonates with the long-established principle that IL-4R\u03b1 signals promote Th2 and impair Th1 cell differentiation. Likewise, we found that IL-4R\u03b1-deficient memory phenotype CD8 + T cells exhibited enhanced not diminished expansion in response to LCMV infection when their numbers were normalized with WT cells through adoptive transfer. Hence, IL-4 appears to act to both increase the number of memory-like CD8 + T cells while also reducing their individual capacity to elicit inflammatory cytokines in vitro and mount a robust response to viral infection in vivo.",

            "text": "Because these data suggest that IL-4 sensitivity has both positive and negative effects on the quantity/quality of the CD8 + T cell pool, they raise the question of whether developmental exposure to IL-4 would improve or diminish the CD8 + T cell response to pathogens. Previous studies have indicated that some homeostatic memory-like CD8 + T cell populations are regulatory cells, capable of restraining CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses (Rifa'i et al., 2004;Lin et al., 2007;Dai et al., 2010;Kim et al., 2010Kim et al., , 2011Sakuraba et al., 2013). Published studies suggest loss of IL-4 sensitivity compromises the CD8 + T cell response to liver stage malaria (Carvalho et al., 2002;Morrot et al., 2005). In our experiments, we found that loss of IL-4 sensitivity by the CD8 + T cell population led to diverse changes in the response to acute LCMV infection. The magnitude of the antigen-specific response was compromised in IL-4R\u03b1-deficient mice, as was the production of effector cells expressing high levels of Eomes. Interpreting the basis for these changes in the intact IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice is complicated by the fact that these mice exhibit both slightly reduced numbers of preimmune CD8 + T cells and changes in gene expression and functional traits within the CD8 + population. However, similar conclusions were reached from studies using mixed BM chimeras, in which the numbers of preimmune WT and IL-4R\u03b1 KO CD8 + T cells were normalized. Collectively with the data discussed in the previous paragraph on the robust reactivity of memory phenotype IL-4R\u03b1 KO CD8 + T cells, our data suggest that the impaired LCMV-specific response observed in IL-4R\u03b1 KO mice is chiefly caused by a deficit in the numbers rather than the intrinsic quality of memory phenotype CD8 + T cells.",

How variability in IL-4 expression levels alters the frequency or characteristics of these CD8 + T cells is unclear. In a set of mouse strains, there was a correlation between the frequencies of IL-4-producing invariant NK T cells and thymic innate memory CD8 + T cells (Lee et al., 2013b). It is possible that humans with sustained elevated levels of IL-4 (e.g., individuals with atopic diseases or infection with pathogens inducing chronic Th2 responses) may undergo similar changes in the developing CD8 + T cell pool, which would promote balance in the immune system by increasing the numbers of cells competent to participate in type-1 immune responses.",
