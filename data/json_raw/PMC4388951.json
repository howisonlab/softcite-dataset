            "text": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with an excess mortality from cardiovascular disease which is likely attributed to an atherogenic lipid profile. Among nutritional factors vitamin K has been recently focused as a pivotal nutrient in improvement of lipid related markers. Thus, this study was designed to determine the effects of vitamin K on lipid profile in this disease. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fifty eight patients with definitive RA were participated in the present double blind placebo controlled study. They were randomly allocated into two groups to receive vitamin K1 as phylloquinone [10 mg/day] (n = 30) or placebo pills (n = 28), for eight weeks. In order to control the effects of probable confounders dietary intakes, anthropometric measurements including weight and height, clinical status using disease activity score-28 (DAS-28), physical activity and anxiety status were evaluated at baseline. Moreover, serum levels of lipid related markers including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) were measured at baseline and at the end of intervention. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding any of the baseline characteristics. After adjusting for some relevant confounders, in comparison between two groups, we observed no significant changes in lipid related markers at the end of intervention. Also, there was no significant difference between before and after intervention values within groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Function of vitamin K1 in lipid profile modification remains still controversial. This study showed that vitamin K1 has no effect on lipid profile in women with rheumatoid arthritis. Further studies with a longer follow-up are required to determine the effects of vitamin K on atherogenic lipid profile.",

Neither at beginning nor at the end of intervention the lipid related markers had significant differences between two groups. Even after adjusting for some confounders such as duration of RA, energy intake, weight, prothrombin time and baseline values, results of analysis of covariance did not show any significant differences in the levels of these markers between two groups at the end of the study (P > 0.05). Although, given the differences (with 95% confidence interval), surprisingly we noticed a worse serum lipid profile at the end of intervention in both groups that wasn't significantly different between before and after intervention values within groups (P > 0.05).",

            "text": "The study conducted by Kawashima et al. [12] in hypercholesterolemic rabbits showed that vitamin K2 significantly decreased plasma total cholesterol, lipid peroxidation and ester-cholesterol deposition in the aortas of rabbits. Another experimental study in rats indicated a significant reduction in serum triglyceride levels following vitamin K1 and K2 rich diets (600 mg/kg/day). In their study the reduction in triglycerides level in phylloquinone group was 48% versus 29% in menaquinone group compared with the control. These data support a presumptive favorable effect of vitamin K1 on lipid profile [11]. Human investigations in the literature in this field are scanty. One study which conducted in dialysis patients who had osteoporosis due to secondary hyperparathyroidism, found a similar results to the previous experimental researches. Their study showed that administration of daily 45 mg MK-4, reduced serum total cholesterol significantly, without influencing triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein serum levels [13]. In contrast to aforementioned findings, we observed no significant lipid lowering effect of phylloquinone. Surprisingly, we found a little non significant increase in the levels of blood lipids after intervention period in both groups. In support of our findings, a study by Kristensen et al. [14] has reported that six weeks phylloquinone supplementation in postmenopausal women not only didn't reach an improvement in lipid profile but also it induced an unfavorable effect on lipid profile. Inefficiency of food frequency questionnaire in exact determination of phylloquinone intake, not considering the baseline serum levels of lipid related markers and remarkable dropouts through the study were declared as explanations of these surprising findings [14]. However, a growing body of documents supports a pivotal role of vitamin K in improvement of lipid profile and coronary heart disease, little information is available about the mechanisms of this function. Understanding the mechanisms might explain these discrepant data. In this regard, several cell pathways which vitamin K influences to alter serum lipid related markers are proposed. Some certain proteins which are necessary for vascular tissue health are activated via vitamin K-dependant gamma-carboxylation process. Among these proteins, carboxylated form of matrix Gla-protein (MGP) prevents the infiltration of calcium into the vascular tissues. Thus, calcification of soft tissues may not happen in presence of vitamin K [10].",
