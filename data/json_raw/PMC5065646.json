Currently it consists of a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria with a high DNA G+C content [2]. In the genus Corynebacterium many species are involved in human and animal diseases, whereas many others are normal flora on skin and mucous membranes [3][4][5]. Corynebacteria are found in different environments such as water, soil, plants and human samples [6][7][8][9][10]. Among corynebacteria, the most significant human pathogen is Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which causes diphtheria worldwide [11]. However, most corynebacteria are opportunistic pathogens [6]. Bacteria found in urine are occasionally associated with urinary infection [12,13].",

A new bacterial description concept was developed in our laboratory [18][19][20][21][22] with the recent development of genome sequencing technology [23]. This concept, taxonogenomics [24], is a combination of proteomic description and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profile [25] associated with a phenotypic description and the sequencing, annotation and comparison of the complete genome of the new bacteria species [26].",

Colonies were deposited in duplicate on a MTP 96 MALDI-TOF MS target plate (Bruker Daltonics, Leipzig, Germany), which was analysed with a Microflex spectrometer (Bruker). The 12 spectra obtained were matched against the references of the 7567 bacteria contained in the database by standard pattern matching (with default parameter settings), with MALDI BioTyper database software 2.0 (Bruker). An identification score over 1.9 with a validated species allows identification at the species level, and a score under 1.7 does not enable any identification. When identification by MALDI-TOF MS failed, the 16S rRNA was sequenced [30].
