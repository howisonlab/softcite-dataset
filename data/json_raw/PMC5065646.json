            "text": "The genus Corynebacterium was described in 1896 by Lehmann and Neumann and belongs to the Actinobacteria class [1]. Currently it consists of a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria with a high DNA G+C content [2]. In the genus Corynebacterium many species are involved in human and animal diseases, whereas many others are normal flora on skin and mucous membranes [3][4][5]. Corynebacteria are found in different environments such as water, soil, plants and human samples [6][7][8][9][10]. Among corynebacteria, the most significant human pathogen is Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which causes diphtheria worldwide [11]. However, most corynebacteria are opportunistic pathogens [6]. Bacteria found in urine are occasionally associated with urinary infection [12,13].",

This classification system has its limitations, such as the high cost of the DNA-DNA hybridization technique and its low reproducibility [14,17]. A new bacterial description concept was developed in our laboratory [18][19][20][21][22] with the recent development of genome sequencing technology [23]. This concept, taxonogenomics [24], is a combination of proteomic description and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profile [25] associated with a phenotypic description and the sequencing, annotation and comparison of the complete genome of the new bacteria species [26].",

Colonies were deposited in duplicate on a MTP 96 MALDI-TOF MS target plate (Bruker Daltonics, Leipzig, Germany), which was analysed with a Microflex spectrometer (Bruker). The 12 spectra obtained were matched against the references of the 7567 bacteria contained in the database by standard pattern matching (with default parameter settings), with MALDI BioTyper database software 2.0 (Bruker). An identification score over 1.9 with a validated species allows identification at the species level, and a score under 1.7 does not enable any identification. When identification by MALDI-TOF MS failed, the 16S rRNA was sequenced [30].

Cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis was performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/ MS). Two samples were prepared with approximately 60 mg of bacterial biomass per tube collected from several culture plates. FAMEs were prepared as previously described (http://www. midi-inc.com/pdf/MIS_Technote_101.pdf), and GC/MS analyses were carried out as previously described [32]. Briefly, FAMEs were separated using an Elite 5-MS column and monitored by mass spectrometry (Clarus 500-SQ 8 S; Perkin Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France  proteinase K at 37\u00b0C.
