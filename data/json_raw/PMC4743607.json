Prospective studies in various cardiovascular populations show that Type D personality predicted impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disease-specific health status. We examined the effect of negative affectivity (NA), social inhibition (SI) and their combined effect (Type D personality) on HRQoL and disease-specific health status among colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Methods. CRC patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2009, as registered in the Dutch population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry, received questionnaires on Type D personality (DS14), HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) and diseasespecific health status (EORTC QLQ-CR38) in 2010, 2011 and 2012. results. Response rates were 73% (n \ue035 2625), 83% (n \ue035 1643) and 82% (n \ue035 1458), respectively. Analyses were done on those completing at least two questionnaires (n \ue035 1735). Individuals with Type D (NA\ue031/SI\ue031; 19%) and high NA (NA\ue031/SI-; 11%) reported a significantly worse HRQoL and disease-specific health status compared to NA-/SI\ue031 and NA-/SI-. Differences were stable over time. Linear mixed effects models showed that Type Ds had a lower quality of life, cognitive and emotional functioning, more insomnia, diarrhea, gastrointestinal, defecation and stoma-related problems and poor body image and future perspective compared to the reference group (NA-/SI-), even after controlling for sociodemographic and clinical variables. High NA individuals (NA\ue031/SI-) reported similar poor health outcomes as Type Ds. However, they also reported lower social functioning and more fatigue, pain, micturition-and financial problems, while Type Ds reported more constipation, sexual problems and less sexual enjoyment. conclusions. Type D personality and high NA both have a significant negative stable impact on HRQoL and diseasespecific health status among CRC patients.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most prevalent cancer in the Netherlands. There were about 45 000 CRC survivors in 2000, while in 2020 the total number is expected to have doubled [1]. Most research among CRC survivors focusses on the role of clinical variables, like diagnosis and treatment, on healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) and disease-specific health status (e.g. side effects and symptoms). However, the role of individual differences in this matter is under exposed. The holy grail of personalized medicine, which is currently the dominant ambition of translational research, will remain elusive unless we can find ways to identify those patients that experience a healthy cancer survivorship, and those patients who do not. In addition to clinical and demographic characteristics, individual differences in personality can probably help to identify those patients [2].",

Type D is defined by the combination of two personality traits; the tendency to experience negative emotions [negative affectivity (Na)] and to inhibit self-expression in social interaction [social inhibition (SI)] [6]. as such, Type D has been associated with adverse health outcomes, impaired health status and HRQoL, more serious illness perceptions and an increased health care utilization [2,4,5,7,8]. Overall, the Na component of Type D plays a more important role than the SI component in terms of general HRQoL, while the specific combination of Na and SI in Type D has been related to symptoms of anhedonia, mental fatigue and decreased motivation [9]. There are a number of potential pathways that could explain the relationship between personality and worse self-reported health and HRQoL. For example, patients with Type D and high Na may be more likely to perceive and attend to somatic symptoms and to interpret them as potentially pathological [8]. In addition, Type D personality has been associated with an unhealthy lifestyle and poor treatment adherence, which, in turn, may have an adverse effect on perceived health [8].",

In order to predict which CRC patients will experience a self-reported healthy cancer survivorship, we will investigate the degree to which HRQoL and disease-specific health status can be explained by individual differences in the personality (e.g. Na, SI and Type D personality), while controlling for clinical characteristics.",

This suggests that Na should be the primary focus when evaluating personality-related differences in patientreported outcomes. Other studies also suggested that the Na component of Type D is the key predictor of subjective health outcomes in both healthy [27] and cardiac populations [28]. The specific combination of Na and SI in the Type D construct may be more important regarding the risk of adverse cardiac events. a recent study in 541 patients with coronary artery disease showed that Type D personality was associated with cardiac death and myocardial infarction, while patients with high Na or SI alone were not at an increased risk [29].",

            "text": "The present study has some limitations. although we had sociodemographic and clinical information of non-respondents, it remains unknown whether they declined to participate because of poor health. Furthermore, personality traits like neuroticism or a low sense of coherence are also known to exert influence on HRQoL and we did not take them into account. Finally, although Type D personality is a stable construct [30], and although this is a prospective study, our analyses limit the determination of causal association between personality and patientreported outcomes as baseline data on these outcomes are unknown. The strengths of this study are  that we assessed HRQoL and disease-specific health status prospectively in a large population-based setting which provides information on the persistence of these constructs over time in a representative group of CRC patients in daily practice. Type D personality and high Na were associated with poor HRQoL and disease-specific health status among survivors of CRC, even after controlling for sociodemographic and clinical variables. By taking a patient's personality into account, this study offers a different view on personalized medicine. Evaluating HRQoL and disease-specific health status according to personality is of great value as this informs about the disease burden and treatment-related effects directly from the patients' perspective. This information will help clinicians to inform CRC patients about potential late side effects. Furthermore, this can possibly lead to the development and evaluation of strategies for tailored long-term management and support for survivors on the basis of a more individualized approach, as a function of stable differences in coping with chronic medical conditions. For example, mindfulness-based stress reduction may reduce levels of negative affectivity and social inhibition [31]. Paying attention to the recognition of Na seems warranted as these patients reported a worse HRQoL and disease-specific health status.
