Hemodynamic alterations during surgery as well as the underlying disease are the predisposing factors. We aimed to study intermittent furosemide therapy in the prevention of renal failure in patients undergoing CABG. METHODS: In a single-blind randomized controlled trial, 123 elective CABG patients, 18-75 years, entered the study. Clearance of creatinine, urea and water were measured. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups: furosemide in prime (0.3-0.4 mg/kg); intermittent furosemide during CABG (0.2 mg/kg, if there was a decrease in urinary excretion) and control (no furosemide). RESULTS: There was a significant change in serum urea, sodium and fluid balance in \"intermittent furosemide\" group; other variables did not change significantly before or after the operation. Post-operative fluid balance was significantly higher in \"intermittent furosemide\" group (2573 \u00b1 205 ml) compared to control (1574.0 \u00b1 155.0 ml) (P < 0.010); also, fluid balance was higher in \"intermittent furosemide\" group (2573 \u00b1 205 ml) compared to \"furosemide in prime\" group (1935.0 \u00b1 169.00 ml) (P < 0.010). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated no benefit from intermittent furosemide in elective CABG compared to furosemide in prime volume or even placebo.",

            "text": "Acute renal failure (ARF) is a complex disorder, which is commonly seen in the perioperative period and in the intensive care unit (ICU). This phenomenon occurs in a variety of settings with clinical manifestations ranging from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure. 1,2 It would be associated with a prolonged hospital stay and high morbidity and mortality. 3 ARF after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is an important and independent risk factor of mortality and morbidity. 4,5 As a result, the implications of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery are very well-known to cardiac anesthesiologists and intensivists. [6][7][8] Recent studies have focused on the preventive strategies; which could be used for the high risk subsets for ARF. 9 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that in high-risk cardiac surgical patients, post-operative furosemide infusion could not improve the clinical outcome of the patients in preventing the occurrence of ARF. 10 Here, we aimed to study the possible role of early furosemide administration (as two different modes) compared with control, in the prevention of renal failure in patients undergoing elective CABG. Hence, there are some controversial issues regarding the need for more sophisticated studies to come to a final decision to define which therapeutic option is more effective.",

However, the findings indicated that patients receiving intermittent furosemide therapy had the greatest positive fluid balance (i.e., extra fluid remaining in the body) compared to the other patient groups. The question here is why patients with positive fluid balance had decreased urine production during the operation; this finding could possibly be due to hypotension during the operation.",

            "text": "Based on other studies, renal function is an important determinant of post-operative clinical outcome. 14 also, ARF after cardiac surgery is a significant predictor of hospital mortality. 15 On the other hand, some studies have demonstrated different independent risk factors, including old age, previous renal failure, emergency and high risk surgery, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart disease, and the need for inotropic drugs for ARF in CABG patients. [6][7][8] ARF is also independently associated with early mortality following cardiac surgery, even after adjustment for comorbidities and post-operative complications. 16 These findings are of great clinical importance. Inconsistent with our findings, many other studies have questioned the role of intermittent furosemide therapy in the prevention of ARF. 17 In a recent randomized clinical trial by Mahesh et al., 10 and Faritous et al. 18 furosemide-infusion did not showed any benefit in high-risk cardiac surgical patients and despite an increase in urinary output with furosemide, there was no decrease in renal injury, and no decrease in incidence of renal dysfunction. It could be concluded that the intermittent furosemide therapy, only increases urinary output and is not effective in the prevention of ARF. Moreover, we showed that in some parameters, intermittent furosemide therapy might deteriorate some of the renal function test indices in patients undergoing CABG with CPB.",
