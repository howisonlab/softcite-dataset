            "text": "Background: Recent evidence has suggested that epithelial cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC) have driven by a small population of self-renewing, multi-potent cells termed cancer stem cells (CSCs) which could be responsible for recurrence of cancer. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) activity has used as a functional stem cell biomarker to isolate CSCs in different cancers such as colorectal cancer. Objectives: The main aim of this research was to determine the utility of ALDH1 activity along with CD44 and EPCAM in identifying stem cell-like cells in human HT-29 colonic adenocarcinoma cell line. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, colon CSCs biomarkers including CD44, EPCAM and ALDH1 in colonospheres and parent cells have analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression levels of stemness genes in spheroid and parental cells have investigated using SYBR Green real-time PCR. In addition, in vivo xenografts assay has performed to determine tumorigenic potential of tumor spheroid cells in nude mice. Results: According to results, over 92% of spheroids were CD44+/EpCAM+, while parent cells only have expressed 38% of CD44/EpCAM biomarkers (P < 0.001). Controversially, ALDH activity was about 2-fold higher in the parent cells than spheroid cells (P < 0.05). In comparison with the parental cells, expression levels of ''stemness'' genes, like Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, C-myc, and Klf4 have significantly increased in colonosphere cells (P < 0.05). Further, administration of 2500 spheroids could be sufficient to initiate tumor growth in nude mice, while 1x106 of parental cells has needed to form tumor. Conclusions: For the first time, we have shown that colonospheres with low ALDH1 activity has indicated increased tumorigenic potential and stemness properties. So, it hasn't seemed that ALDH1 could become a useful biomarker to identify CSCs population in HT-29 cell line.",

To investigate the capability of colon spheres differentiation, these cells have cultivated in 10% FBS medium rather than EGF and FGF-2. In present serum, spherical undifferentiated cells have attached to the plate, and differentiated into adherent cells with epithelial cell morphology (Figure 1). In serum free condition, the expression levels of EpCAM and CD44 were significantly higher in spheroid than parent cells (P < 0.001) ( Figure 2). The results have demonstrated that 92.3 \u00b1 3.6% of these tu-mor spheroid cells were CD44+/EpCAM+, while parent cells only have expressed 38.4 \u00b1 1.6% of CD44+/EpCAM+ markers. We have measured ALDH1 activity in colonospheres and parent cells-derived colonic HT-29 cell line. Interestingly, we have found that HT29 cells have exhibited substantially high levels of ALDH activity in the parent fractions in compared with the spheroid fractions. ALDH activity was 16.9 \u00b1 1.2 in spheroid cells in comparison with 34.6 \u00b1 2.3 in parental cells (P < 0.05) (Figure 3). We have evaluated the frequency of sphere-forming cells by doing an extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA) for spheroid and parent-derived HT-29 cells. The results have indicated that the frequency of spheroid formation in cell line -derived colonospheres were 6.4 fold higher than -derived the parent cells (P < 0.005) ( Table 2). The findings have suggested that colonospheres have formed by the colon cancer cell have enriched population of CSCs.",

Chu et al. has revealed that in vivo implantation of CD-44hi ALDH+ colon tumor cells were significantly more tumorigenic than matched CD44hi ALDH-cells. Therefore, as few as 100 CD44hi ALDH+ cells could lead to tumor formation (5). In addition, Huang et al. (16) has shown that implantation of only 25 ALDH+ cancer cells have tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID mice. However, further isolation of cancer cells ALDH+ using CD44 or CD133 only modestly has resulted in tumor-initiating ability (11). Thus, we have suggested that ALDH1 activity could be a valuable biomarker for identifying CSC in colonosphere population. Controversy, our findings have revealed that colonospheres exhibit have decreased levels of ALDH1 activity in comparison with the corresponding parental cells. Nevertheless, low ALDH1 activity in colonospheres had no effect on their tumorigenic potential, so this population even has shown higher ability for initiating tumor, in comparison with parental cell with high ALDH1 activity in in vivo situation. Our results have shown that administration of 2500 colonospheres could be sufficient to initiate tumor growth in nude mice while 1 \u00d7 10 6 of parental cells has needed to form tumor. It would be important to point out that results of primary tumor could not generalized to colonic cell line like HT-29.
