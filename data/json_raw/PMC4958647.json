SUBJECTS/METHODS: Based on 24-hour dietary recall data from the 4th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), we developed a FFQ with 71 items. From a quota sample of 160 adolescents recruited using gender and age group as stratification variables, 153 participated in the complete data collection process. The FFQ was administered to each subject twice, at an interval of 3-4 weeks, to evaluate the test-retest reliability. The validity of the FFQ was assessed relative to 8-day food record data. RESULTS: The study findings demonstrated the FFQ's satisfactory reproducibility. Spearman correlation coefficients ranged from 0.64(for \u03b2-carotene) to 0.81(for protein). From cross-classification analyses, the proportion of subjects in the same intake quartile was highest for protein (65.4%) and lowest for vitamin A(47.1%). With regard to validity analysis, Spearman correlation coefficients ranged from 0.27(for vitamin A and fiber) to 0.90 (for energy). The proportions of subjects in the opposite categories between the first FFQ and the 8-day food record data were generally low within the range from 0.74% (for energy and carbohydrate) to 13.2% (for \u03b2-carotene). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the dish-based semiquantitative FFQ developed in this study can be useful for grouping Korean adolescents according to major macro-and micronutrient intakes with reasonable reproducibility and validity.",

            "text": "Investigations of the effects of diet on the prevention and occurrence of diseases require a tool for reasonably assessing the dietary intake. In the case of chronic diseases, it is necessary to understand the dietary intake over an extended period, and the food frequency method, which reflects long-term dietary intake, is normally used. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) also needs to reflect dietary characteristics of the target population [1].",

            "text": "The results of a recent survey indicate that Korean adolescents do not consume the recommended nutrient intakes of calcium, vitamin A, riboflavin, and vitamin C. Furthermore, 18%, 21.5%, and 80% of adolescents consume more than the dietary reference intake levels of energy, fat, and sodium, respectively, which indicates the presence of nutritional imbalance problems with Korea adolescents [2]. According to an analysis of the 2005 and 2013 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) applied to representative Korean samples, the dietary pattern of Korean adolescents changed rapidly during the 8-year period: the daily intake of vegetables decreased from 260 g to 214 g, the intake of fruit increased from 80 g to 140 g, and the intake of animal foods increased from 279 g to 396 g. These changes illustrate the dynamic dietary pattern of Korean adolescents. Comparing the average daily nutrient and dietary intakes between adolescents aged 12-18 years and adults aged 30-49 years according to the 2013 KNHANES revealed that the intake of certain micronutrients (e.g., calcium, iron, and potassium) is much lower for adolescents than for adults. In terms of food groups, the intake of plant foods was lower and that of animal foods was higher for adolescents than for adults, revealing a clear distinction between these two age groups [2,3]. Therefore, a dietary research tool is needed for conducting systematic research into the nutritional status of adolescents, who are characterized by a dynamic and distinct dietary consumption relative to other life cycle groups.",

            "text": "FFQs for adolescents have been widely developed and evaluated worldwide [4][5][6][7]. Rockett et al. [4] developed an FFQ for American adolescents aged 9-18 years with 116 itemsincluding food that is frequently consumed in this age group-in  order to understand their general diet. The reproducibility over a 1-year period was found to be acceptable. Yaroch et al. [5] developed an FFQ for low-income African-American adolescents aged 11-17 years for application in a dietary survey. In addition to FFQs focusing on the overall diet, FFQs have been developed for understanding the intake of specific nutrients or food groups, and such research has shown that FFQs can be useful in evaluating the diet of school-age children and adolescents [8][9][10][11][12]. However, the large differences between the food cultures of Korea and other countries imply that foreign FFQs cannot be applied to Korean adolescents [1]. While several studies have (Ed-or 'While extensive research has') been conducted to develop FFQs for Korean adults and elderly since the mid-1990s [13][14][15][16][17][18][19], only a few studies have developed FFQs for Korean adolescents [20]. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a semiquantitative FFQ for Korean adolescents and evaluate its reproducibility and validity. The FFQ was designed to assess intake levels of major macro-and micronutrients based on dish-based items.",

A stepwise multiple regression analysis was subsequently conducted with the independent variables being the dish codes that remained after the contribution analysis. Dish codes that constituted 80% of the nutrient intake were retained. Out of the 16 stepwise multiple regression analyses, dish codes that remained at least once were selected as the final FFQ items. Also, 4 types of fruit were added to the item list because the fruit intake changes markedly according to season, resulting in the final selection of 71 items (Fig. 2).",

When numerous food codes were implicated due to the inclusion of various recipes, the food codes were chosen by combining the appearance frequency of similar ingredients according to their weight. Food ingredients reported by fewer eaters (i.e., less than 20% of the total appearance frequency for that dish code) were eliminated to enhance the simplicity and representativeness of the recipes. Hence, overestimation of the food weight was prevented by avoiding the simple addition of the average amount for each food ingredient used.

Since the food records used as comparative data in the FFQ validity analysis might have attenuated the validity due to day-to-day variations, the de-attenuated correlation coefficients were calculated. The data were divided into four categories according to the nutrient intake. Crossclassification was then conducted to identify the consistency between the first and second FFQ data, as well as between FFQ and food record data. The corresponding weighted kappa values were calculated. In addition, the Bland-Altman plots were generated to examine the reproducibility and validity of the FFQ. The cutoff for statistical significance was 0.05 in two-tailed testing.  Table 2 lists the 71 finally chosen FFQ items. Considering that adolescents can exhibit a low response rate when the assessment tool involves complicated questions (21) and variations in the frequency choices between different FFQ items may increase the proportion of mistakes, the following eight frequency choices were applied to all 71 items: 'less than once a month,' '1 to 3 times a month,' 'once a week,' '2 to 3 times a week,' '4 to 6 times a week,' 'once a day,' '2 times a day,' and '3 or more times a day.' For the portion size option, three choices of 'less than the amount in the photo,' 'close to the amount in the photo,' and 'more than the amount in the photo' were presented.

An FFQ consisting of 69 items for Belgian adolescents showed reproducibility correlation coefficients ranging from 0.27 to 0.87 (with an average of 0.62) [6]. FFQ development and evaluation studies have also been conducted for FFQs targeting specific nutrients or food groups. Buzzard et al. [8] developed a brief FFQ for understanding the fat, cellulose, fruit, and vegetables intakes of adolescents in a rural area, and reported that the reproducibility coefficients of the developed FFQ were 0.58 for fat, 0.49 for cellulose, and 0.47 for fruit and vegetables. The correlation coefficients for the test-retest reproducibility of another simple FFQ created for understanding the fruit and vegetable intakes of high elementary graders in Korea ranged from 0.22 to 0.64 [22].",

Vereecken and Maes conducted a development and evaluation study of a simple FFQ with 15 items focusing on the intakes of cellulose, calcium, and some unhealthy food items [9]. Among Belgian adolescents, the weighed kappa values ranged from 0.43 to 0.70, which are similar to the values found in the present study.

However, it was consistent with our study that correlations coefficients for macronutrients were generally higher compared to those for micronutrients. In other studies, the correlation coefficient of vitamin A was 0.36 [24] and 0.37 [25], which is lower than that for other nutrients, and for an Iranian FFQ, the correlation coefficient for vitamin A was reported to have a negative value [26].

Willett investigated the classification consistency between dietary recording and FFQ, and found that the consistent proportion was 48-49%, the proximal proportion was 74-79%, and the inconsistent proportion was 3-4% [24]. According to another study [23], the consistent, proximal, and inconsistent proportions were 26.6-44.0%, 34.3-44.4%, and 1.5-9.7%, respectively. The consistent and proximal proportions for macronutrients in the present study are similar to or higher than those found in the previous studies. On the other hand, the inconsistent proportion for \u03b2 -carotene was 13.2%, which is higher than that of previous studies. Willet [27] and Kim & Yang [28] reported a value of 4%, whereas Rimm et al. [29] reported results similar to the present study: 12% for vitamins A and B12 Yim et al. [20] found that the consistency rate was very high (0.63-0.88) for most nutrients except for vitamin A (0.26). Several possible reasons can be postulated for the low validity levels for a few micronutrients for the developed FFQ. First, the validity may have been underestimated due to use of the FFQ administered before the diet record data collection. Second, the variability between seasons for the fruit and vegetables included in the FFQ could have resulted in differences in the consumption according to the period of investigation. Third, the subject characteristics of this study may have lowered the validity. Most adolescents do not cook, and so they may not have enough information about seasonings and spices, leading to some information not being recorded on the dietary record sheet.",
