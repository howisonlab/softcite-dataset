The aim of the present study is to elucidate potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for SCI-induced muscle atrophy (SIMA) using proteomic and bioinformatic analyses. The protein samples from rat soleus muscle were collected at different time points following SCI injury and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and compared with the sham group. The identities of these protein spots were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). MS demonstrated that 20 proteins associated with muscle atrophy were differentially expressed. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that SIMA changed the expression of proteins associated with cellular, developmental, immune system and metabolic processes, biological adhesion and localization. The results of the present study may be beneficial in understanding the molecular mechanisms of SIMA and elucidating potential biomarkers and targets for the treatment of muscle atrophy.",

            "text": "SCI commonly leads to muscle atrophy (2). Previous research has demonstrated that within the initial 6-18 months following SCI, 27 to 56% of the muscle fibers have atrophied (3). Currently, there is no clear consensus regarding classification of the type of atrophy that occurs following SCI, certain reports suggest disuse (4-7) and denervated atrophy (8,9). However, the atrophy induced by SCI is different from the aforementioned types of atrophy. Disuse models are based on variable degrees of unloading and inactivity, including ankle immobilization and hindlimb unloading. Disuse-induced muscle atrophy occurs when the central nervous system is intact. Another scenario is denervated atrophy, which is often induced by the model of peripheral axotomy (10,11). The central nervous system is not damaged in this type of muscle atrophy, as the injury is restricted to the axon of the dorsal root ganglion. The difference between SCI-induced muscle loss and the aforementioned types of atrophy is that in SCI the lower motor neurons remain intact and upper neurons cannot transmit information to the lower neurons.",

To develop novel treatment strategies or find novel diagnostic markers, it is required to investigate the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that mediate SCI-induced muscle atrophy. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of certain molecules and genes during this pathological process (14)(15)(16). However, the pathological mechanisms of SIMA are complex, thus, only investigating certain molecules is insufficient. Microarray data has provided some indication of the changes to mRNA expression levels that occur within the whole genome following SCI. However, the mRNA expression level does not always correlate with the protein expression level. Post-translational modifications and microRNAs may affect the protein expression levels (17). Thus, adopting a proteomics approach to analyze the global protein profile in SIMA may provide more accurate information that cannot be obtained from microarray analysis.",

The rats were divided into a sham group and two injury groups (7 and 14 days post-SCI; n=10/group). The contusion injury models were induced by the standard New York University (NYU) impactor, as described previously (18). Animals were anesthetized (3 ml/kg 10% chloral hydrate, intraperitoneally) and laminectomized to expose the T10 spinal cord. A moderate injury was generated by dropping a metal rod (10 g, 12.5 mm) onto the back side of the spinal cord. The compression force and velocity were controlled by a surveillance system to maintain uniformity between animals. These rats were manually treated with bladder emptying. Sham subjects underwent a T10 laminectomy without contusion. Locomotive behavior was assessed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 days following injury using Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score (19) to ensure that all subjects exhibited a normal curve of functional changes following SCI.",

In present study, it was demonstrated that this method is efficient for the identification of multiple proteins, a number of them at low abundance. Previous studies investigating muscle atrophy typically focus on the disuse and denervated animal models to simulate their corresponding clinical phenomenon. SIMA is often classified as one of these models of muscle atrophy or a combination of these models. However, the pathological process of SIMA involves multiple factors, including signal transduction, immunization, electrical conduction, stimuli and metabolism (22), which results in a complex condition that cannot be attributed to one molecular mechanisms or a simpler combination of a small number. Thus, the present study investigated the pathological changes that occur during SIMA. Using 2D gels, numerous proteins were identified. Certain proteins exhibited a similar expression pattern as previously described (23), but others exhibited different curves or inconsistent ones (24). The potential importance and function of these proteins in SIMA is discussed further below.",

Previous research demonstrated that 14-3-3 proteins are upregulated in the denervated tibialis anterior muscle of rats (25). However, other studies have observed that 14-3-3 was not increased in the skeletal muscles of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is a hypoxemic disease with similar characteristics to the early changes observed in the microenvironment during SCI (26). As a prognostic  indicator, early accumulation of the 14-3-3 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with acute transverse myelitis was perceived to have been associated with little or no recovery of neurological function (27). However, deficiencies have been noted regarding certain aspects of these previous studies. The limited number of subjects (n=4 per group) may influence the accuracy of results. Furthermore, a previous study (28) observed that 14-3-3 protein was only expressed in ~10% of the patients and concluded that 14-3-3 expression was, thus, not associated with a poor patient outcome. Therefore, the present study hypothesizes that 14-3-3 may be important for the prediction of recovery from muscle atrophy following SCI. Certain studies support this hypothesis. In the cerebrospinal fluid of SCI rats, severe injury induced a slight reduction in 14-3-3 protein expression compared with moderate injury (29). Another study with a contusion model demonstrated that the expression levels of three isoforms of the 14-3-3 protein family increased at the mid-stage of the recovery following the restoration of bladder function (30). Despite the possibility that elevated levels of 14-3-3 protein following SCI may reflect the process of neuronal damage (31), in the central system (32) or peripheral tissues (33), the present results demonstrate that 14-3-3 protein, coupled with functional recovery, was increased despite an early decrease, which may be attributed to the slow reaction of the protein.",

An aim of future research will be to investigate that underlying mechanism that results in changes to 14-3-3 expression levels following SCI. Different severities of SCI and more time points will be useful to elucidate     the biochemical and pathophysiological function of proteins differentially expressed in SIMA. \u03b1B-crystallin (CryAB) is a small heat shock protein involved in preventing protein aggregation (34). Dysfunction of CryAB may result in skeletal muscle disorders and enhancing the function of this protein is accepted as a potential therapeutic strategy (35). Previous studies indicate that CryAB is a protective protein that maintains the capability of satellite cells to regenerate skeletal muscle (34) and that it is important for muscle homeostasis (36). Denervated tibialis anterior muscle exhibits increased expression of CryAB. CryAB can prevent apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, which may explain why fast-twitch anterior muscle exhibits reduced atrophy (25). In the present study, CryAB protein expression was upregulated at 7 days post-SCI and then reduced to the level as that of the control by day 14. This notable finding is contrary to previous research that demonstrated that denervation decreased the expression levels of CryAB in slow muscle, particularly in the soleus (37). However, this discrepancy suggests that SIMA, which differs from denervation, has the potential for recovery at an early stage and that the upregulation of CryAB may be a marker of protection. This hypothesis is supported by indirect evidence demonstrating that expression of CryAB returned to the level observed in the normal controls following successful reinnervation (38). Together, the results of the present study indicate that, following SCI, there is a transient time window for the self-restoration of skeletal muscle, but ultimately the positive effect is suppressed by persistent disadvantageous pathogenic factors. Thus, confirming the accurate time window and the upregulation of CryAB may be investigated as future therapeutic strategies.",

Research indicates that the expression of \u03b2-enolase following denervation remains at a low level in slow-twitch muscle, however, continues to decrease in the fast-twitch muscle (40,42). However, the present study demonstrated that the expression levels of \u03b2-enolase in SCI muscle increased steadily, which indicates that SIMA has the reverse effect on this protein. Previous evidence suggested that following reinnervation, the expression level of \u03b2-enolase in soleus muscle increased, which may support the hypothesis that the increase of \u03b2-enolase expression in the soleus muscle depends on the integrity of peripheral nerves. However, the functional recovery of SCI is limited and muscle atrophy is inevitable. In sum, the present study hypothesized that the role of \u03b2-enolase is altering the muscle types, as demonstrated in a previous study (43) that supports the current observations. In addition, a longer period of observation is required in future research.",

            "text": "The bio-functions of apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide like 2 (APOBEC2) have been hypothesized to include mediation of the cytidine-to-uridine transcriptional editing of mRNA (44). Due to exclusive expression in skeletal and cardiac muscles, APOBEC2 was suggested to be important in the physiological function of intramuscular development. However, APOBEC2 knockout mice did not exhibit a change in phenotype (45). This may indicate that APOBEC2 subtly regulates certain aspects of muscle function, including the response to damage stimuli. The results of the present study demonstrated that the protein expression levels of APOBEC2 in the soleus increased gradually following SCI, in contrast to the change in expression levels during denervation atrophy (24). This finding may be attributed to intact neurons that give priority to compensation of muscle function by switching the muscle types. A previous study demonstrated that APOBEC2-deficient mice exhibited a marked shift in muscle fiber type, from fast to slow (46). It is hypothesized that the increase of APOBEC2 expression levels may result in enhanced conversion of slow fibers to fast ones. Further evidence indicates that the ratio of slow to fast fibers in soleus muscle was decreased gradually following spinal cord transection (47).",

It is understood that \u03b1-actinin-2 is expressed in all types of muscle fibers, including slow and fast fibers (50). Previous studies demonstrated that \u03b1-actinin-2 can bond with calsarcin-2, a key inhibitor of calcineurin activation, to release calcineurin from calsarcin-2 and change the fast fibers to a slow phenotype (51)(52)(53). The present study demonstrated that following SCI, the expression of \u03b1-actinin-2 in the soleus dropped sharply over time. This decrease indicates that downregulation of \u03b1-actinin-2 may result in enhancement of calsarcin-2, which inhibits the activation of calcineurin signaling, and a shift in fiber type from slow to fast. The results of the current study are consistent with previous research and it is hypothesized that the shift of metabolic phenotype of muscle fibers following SCI preserves the energy metabolism and function of the muscle.",

The protective effects of Hsp70 in muscle atrophy have also been demonstrated in a number of previous studies (55)(56)(57). Upregulation of Hsp70 may prevent muscle atrophy as a result of denervation, aging or disuse (58)(59)(60). The present study observed that the expression of Hsp70 in the soleus muscle was slightly reduced at 7 days post-SCI and then increased sharply at 14 days to a level markedly higher than that of the control. This indicates that the muscle exhibited the potential for restoration following central nervous system injury. The slight reduction observed at the early stage of SCI may be attributed to a temporary disorder of energy metabolism (61) or inhibition of glucocorticoid due to the stress response (62). However, it remains necessary to investigate why the protective effect of Hsp70 is too limited to prevent atrophy and whether the increased expression of this protein is also a transient phenomenon.",

Subsequently, the expression was increased at 14 days post-SCI, with certain isoforms almost at similar levels to the control. The function of MLCs is associated with contractile force and velocity in muscle fibers (63). Multiple reports have demonstrated that the changes to MLCs were associated with fiber-type shift (8,(64)(65)(66). Certain enzymes key in cellular and metabolic processes, including fibrinogen \u03b1 and \u03b2 chain, aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 family member A1 and phosphoglycerate kinase 1, participate in various biological processes and their normal function is for homeostasis of physiological and pathological metabolism (67)(68)(69). Fluctuations in the expression levels of these proteins may indicate that skeletal muscle has been damaged by central nervous system injury, but with relatively integrated peripheral nervous control, will exhibit reduced function of multiple molecular processes at an early stage and subsequently adapt during the middle stage. The results of the current study are in accordance with a previous study that demonstrated that muscle appears to have plasticity and can adapt following moderate spinal cord contusion, which was similar to the present animal model (70).",

            "text": "The data of the current study indicated that SCI-induced atrophic muscles exhibited limited molecular improvements, which may be associated with functional recovery. However these improvements cannot reverse the changes to the size of muscle fibers of the soleus muscles of SCI rats. It is accepted that following moderate contusion, rats will exhibit spontaneous recovery of motor function following a fixed pattern (71,72). Furthermore, previous findings indicated that the growth effects of muscle fibers may result in improvement of motor function (73)(74)(75), however, this does not mean that the size of the fibers is directly associated with BBB score. Notably, the results of the present study demonstrated that the extent of variation in the second week was reduced compared with the change in the first week, which may be attributed to the temporary molecular compensatory mechanisms. These mechanisms may be used as therapeutic targets to induce anti-atrophic effects or reverse the effects on skeletal muscle, potentially coupled with more observable improvement of motor function (34,62). However, in the current study, due to specific molecular improvements, the process of muscle atrophy slowed at a later stage, however, it may not be able to be stopped or reversed. In addition, the increases to BBB scores also slowed down at this stage. Concerning the delayed effects of molecules prior to phenotypic changes, it is concluded that the decreased extent of atrophic response was consistent with the sharp increase to motor function recovery at the early stage. Future studies are required to investigate prolonged observation over increased time points.",

The identified proteins were associated with biological adhesion, cellular processes, developmental processes, immune system processes, localization and metabolic processes. The results of the present study demonstrated that SIMA has characteristics different to disuse and denervated atrophy, or a combination of them. The present study may improve the understanding of the association between central nervous system injury and skeletal muscle atrophy. Furthermore, the results may provide insight into potential mechanisms or cellular pathways that may be adopted as biomarkers and targets for the treatment of SIMA.",
