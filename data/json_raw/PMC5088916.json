            "text": "Background: Liver biopsy is an invasive procedure that is currently still necessary for predicting underlying hepatic injury related to chronic viral hepatitis B (CVHB). To date, none of the studied non-invasive methods have been able to replace liver biopsy. An apoptotic serum marker, M30, which has been reported to indicate ongoing liver fibrosis, has been popular in recent years. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the possible role of M30 in predicting CVHB-associated hepatic injury and its severity. Methods: Forty-eight patients undergoing liver biopsy for evaluation of the severity of CVHB-related liver injury and 40 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional study. M30 levels were determined for all CVHB patients and controls, and other laboratory parameters and demographic features were obtained from our hospital's database. Results: The mean ages of patients and controls were 39.7 and 45.7 years, respectively, and 35% of the controls and 52% of the patients were male. In contrast to lower platelet counts, transaminase and M30 levels were both higher in the patient group than in the controls. Among the investigated parameters, only transaminase increased as the fibrosis stage changed from mild to moderate; however, none of the laboratory parameters, including M30, differed as the histological activity index (HAI) score increased. Conclusions: M30 levels were higher in CVHB patients compared to healthy controls. However, M30 levels were similar in the mild and moderate stages of fibrosis, so they did not indicate the severity of underlying fibrotic or inflammatory processes in CVHB patients.",

In recent years, due to increased information about the transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the application of precautions, such as routine HBV vaccination programs, HBV prevalence has been declining (1,2). However, with increasing life expectancy, the use of antiviral medications is prolonged and therefore drug resistance is increasing. This is an emerging problem in the field of chronic liver disease.",

Upregulation of apoptosis has been shown to have a critical role in inducing inflammation and fibrogenesis in the liver. The amount of cytokeratin-18 fragments cleaved by caspases during apoptosis seems to be a good marker of apoptosis (7), and can easily be measured with a sandwich ELISA technique (M30-based ELISA) (8). M30 determines the degree of apoptotic cells in epithelial organs and tissues. Serum M30 levels were higher in chronic HBV patients compared to healthy controls, and M30 levels were able to be used to discriminate mild from advanced liver fibrosis (9,10). In addition, Giannousis et al. showed a decrease in serum M30 levels after six months of antiviral therapy (11).",

The increase of apoptotic cells results in cytokine secretion, leading to induction of inflammatory and fibrotic processes (Figure 1) (6). Downstream from the cell-death receptor, the proteolytic cascade leads to activation of caspases 3, 6, and 7 (16,20). The activation of caspases may be related  to mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to cytochrome c release or direct cleavage (20,21). The susceptibility to apoptotic cell death may depend on the HBV genotype, as well (22). Not only apoptotic cell death, but also autophagic cell death, may be good predictors for defining the level of liver injury at the beginning of treatment and during the follow-up period (23).",

However, the role of apoptotic markers for replacing liver biopsy in CHB patients and the utility of M30 levels for distinguishing inactive CHB carriers from CHB patients are still controversial. Papatheodoridis et al. gave a cut-off value of 240 U/L for predicting CHB with 60% sensitivity and 100% specificity (9). Rather than grading liver inflammation, Joka et al. determined a cut-off value of 157.5 U/L for predicting mild fibrosis from significant fibrosis (\u2265 F2) in the liver (64% sensitivity and 61% specificity) (18). Differentiating ongoing high-inflammation processes and high fibrosis scores in the liver is crucial for the initiation of antiviral medication without requiring liver biopsy. Similar to Eren et al. and Joka et al., we were unable to identify any relationship between M30 values and the mild to moderate stages of liver fibrosis (10,18). This was a cross-sectional study performed during a specific time period. Therefore, we could not find a sufficient number HBV patients with advanced liver fibrosis. This was an important limitation of the current investigation.",
