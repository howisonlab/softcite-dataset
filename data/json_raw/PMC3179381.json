            "text": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Affected individuals cluster in families in patterns that reflect the sharing of numerous susceptibility genes. Genome-wide and large-scale genecentric genotyping studies that involve tens of thousands of cases and controls have now mapped common disease variants to 34 distinct loci. Some coronary disease common variants show allelic heterogeneity or copy number variation. Some of the loci include candidate genes that imply conventional or emerging risk factor-mediated mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. Quantitative trait loci associations with risk factors have been informative in Mendelian randomization studies as well as fine-mapping of causative variants. But, for most loci, plausible mechanistic links are uncertain or obscure at present but provide potentially novel directions for research into this disease's pathogenesis. The common variants explain \u223c4% of interindividual variation in disease risk and no more than 13% of the total heritability of coronary disease. Although many CAD genes are presently undiscovered, it is likely that larger collaborative genome-wide association studies will map further common/low-penetrance variants and hoped that low-frequency or rare high-penetrance variants will also be identified in medical resequencing experiments.",

It most commonly presents clinically in cases of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction (heart attack), which are due to atherosclerotic plaques that develop progressively as we age and occasionally rupture. Genetic epidemiological studies of family history and twin concordance studies are consistent with an underlying multifactorial model of disease susceptibility with a significant polygenic component. This is complemented by genetic analysis of heritable conventional risk factors such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and systolic blood pressure, which collectively might explain a minor portion of coronary disease risk (2).",

            "text": "Over the past 4 years, researchers have completed several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to map underlying common susceptibility variants for coronary disease. In parallel with GWASs of other complex diseases, it was soon apparent that typical effect sizes for individual singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were fairly small, so large sample sizes would be required for reliable gene mapping. This has encouraged collaboration between individual research groups and led to the formation of consortia to pool the results of GWASs using meta-analysis techniques. Progress has been facilitated by the availability of phased haplotype training sets (notably, from the HapMap project: http ://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/phasing) and the accompanying genotype imputation software (for example, MACH: www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html or IMPUTE: mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/impute_v2.html). These population genetic resources and statistical genetic tools provide an efficient solution to the fact that individual GWASs are often carried out on different SNP arrays with variable SNP overlap.",

            "text": "For some of the SNPs, there is circumstantial evidence to highlight an underlying gene. For example, LIPA encodes lipase A, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. The lead CAD risk SNP in LIPA (4,8) is strongly correlated with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) SNP, with the CAD risk allele correlated with increased expression of LIPA mRNA in monocytes (9) and liver (4), suggesting a functional relationship between the disease association signal and this candidate gene. However, for most of the SNPs mapped by GWASs, it is difficult to implicate an underlying gene. Inspection of recombination frequency maps derived from the HapMap project suggest genetic boundaries defined by recombination hotspots, which drives the traditional approach of fine-mapping using haplotype block information (10). However, there is ample evidence that cis-regulatory mechanisms in the soma can operate over tens, hundreds or even millions of base pairs and are presumably unaffected by meiotic recombination (11). It is becoming possible to define functional genomic boundaries based on chromatin architecture-related factors, such as CCCTCbinding factor sites (12) that are found in the vast majority of vertebrate insulator elements. We suspect that, for most coronary disease loci, it will take some time to complete the sequence of functional genomics experiments that will be required to confidently lay the blame of disease susceptibility on a specific underlying gene. The loci shown in Table 1 should therefore be interpreted as provisional assignments based mainly on proximity (nearest coding sequence). It is noteworthy that the lists of confidently assigned genes across the recent crop of studies show little overlap, which at first glance seems unlikely to be due to differences in tagging SNP coverage, phenotypic heterogeneity or ancestry (these studies are heavily weighted towards European ancestry). We suspect that it most likely has its roots in the small effects conferred by the susceptibility genes (each allele increases risk by 5%). Such small gene effects would, in a GWAS discovery experiment comprising 20K cases and 20K controls, be expected to have only a 5% probability of passing even a modest stage-1 (tentative discovery) threshold of P , 0.00001. Therefore, in absolute terms, this low power to detect an individual gene means that different, and only occasionally overlapping, sets of susceptibility loci are likely to emerge from similarly sized studies (13,14). Of course, even for loci that have surpassed the de facto genome-wide significance threshold of 5 \u00d7 10 28 , there is still an appreciable chance that one or more of the 34 loci will prove to be falsepositives (15). We expect based on binomial theory that the maximum number of false-positive associations in Table 1 will be three or fewer. Skol et al. (16) pointed out that a combined analysis of stage 1 discovery data (based on GWAS SNP arrays) and stage 2 validation data (a subset of the most promising SNPs from stage 1) is more efficient than attempting formal replication in stage 2 and such an analysis is now standard practise. However, some researchers, mindful of historical difficulties of interpreting complex genetic data (17), prefer to apply a cautious approach to secure robust (i.e. taking into account stage 2 multiple testing penalties) and independent (of GWAS discovery) replication data (3,4).",

Genetic association studies generally use samples collected from survivors of disease, for ethical and other pragmatic reasons. For coronary disease, case series are clinically heterogeneous if they include different diagnostic subgroups (e.g. chronic stable angina or myocardial infarction) with subtly differing pathologies that might have an impact on susceptibility.

Plaque rupture and subsequent coronary thrombosis causes acute coronary syndromes such as myocardial infarction, thereby motivating searches for genes that might influence plaque stability. Reilly et al. (6) undertook a GWAS of coronary disease patients with angiographic disease contrasting those cases that had suffered myocardial infarction with those who had not. This study mapped a novel association to the ABO blood group system with SNPs that strongly tag the O allele. The CARDIoGRAM consortium (3), which studied a mixture of coronary disease cases of which two-thirds had suffered a myocardial infarction and a mixture of screened and unscreened controls, also mapped a susceptibility signal to the ABO system. Their lead SNP is only in moderate linkage disequilibrium (r 2 \u00bc 0.39) with the Reilly et al. (6) signal so may be due to allelic heterogeneity or pleiotropy. We must await further fine-mapping studies of the ABO and ADAMTS7 loci to fully understand the details of these associations.",

There has been much effort in mapping common QTL for these traits using GWAS or other large-scale SNP arrays in population-based as well as case-control samples (38)(39)(40). Technical difficulties such as uncontrolled fasting status or on-treatment measurements have been largely overcome to produce a rich crop of risk factor QTL. Notable examples of overlap with coronary disease loci (Table 2) include TRIB1 (Drosophila tribbles homologue, a gene that interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade), which has pleiotropic effects on circulating triglyceride, LDL-and HDL-cholesterol levels (40) and CYP17A1 (17-a hydroxylase gene involved in steroid hormone metabolism) which is a systolic blood pressure QTL (38,39). However, most (22 of 34) of the coronary disease loci do not show convincing risk factor QTL effects (Table 2). It may be that novel heritable intermediate phenotypes will eventually be identified that will explain some of the disease associations; this should lead to informative insights into pathological mechanisms. Indeed, expectations that coronary genes would be involved in innate immunity or thrombosis have not emerged from large-scale genetic association studies to date.",

For instance, the first coronary disease locus to confidently emerge from GWAS mapped to chromosome 9p21 to a region that was initially believed to be a gene desert. However, it was quickly recognized in fine-mapping studies (10) that the associated region, which was of prior interest to cancer genetics researchers (41,42), was potentially linked to neighbouring cyclindependent kinase inhibitor genes CDKN2A (which has multiple synonyms including p16, see www.genecards.org/ cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CDKN2A for more details) and CDKN2B (p15, see www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.p l?gene=CDKN2B). Subsequent studies of murine models have highlighted a Cdkn2a/b-mediated mechanism involving smooth muscle cell proliferation (43). Studies of human transcription enhancer elements propose that the large non-coding antisense RNA molecule CDKN2ABAS, which is also known by the monikers ANRIL and CDKN2B-AS1, is involved in the long-range transcriptional regulation of several genes, including CDKN2A and CDKN2B, in vascular endothelial cell lines (44).",

This Mendelian randomization (MR) information (50) is particularly useful when there are no drugs that specifically modulate the exposure. For instance, Lp(a) is an LDL particle that appears to be proatherogenic in cross-sectional and prospective epidemiological studies. But drugs such as niacin that reduce Lp(a) concentrations also beneficially increase the HDL levels. So, it can be difficult in randomized clinical trials (RCT) to unambiguously attribute any clinical benefit to specific mechanisms. Following a large-scale candidate gene study, two SNPs in the apolipoprotein(a) gene were shown to tag short isoform alleles that were strikingly associated with raised Lp(a) concentrations and coronary disease risk (30) (also discussed in CNV and allelic heterogeneity sections above). Simultaneous modelling of disease risk and quantitative genetic variation were consistent with a direct causal link, thus predicting that pharmacological lowering of Lp(a) levels will be beneficial to patients. Loci that carry triglyceride QTL such as TRIB1 and APOA1-C3-A4-A5 also show QTL effects for HDL and LDL. Consequently, these pleiotropic loci will not be useful for MR probing of the role of triglyceride, a well-studied lipid that is presently not routinely included in cardiovascular risk calculations.",

This research was supplemented by positional cloning experiments that were unbiased in terms of gene candidature (51). In comparison with the levels of statistical support required for GWAS, the evidence for most of the candidate genes was modest despite meta-analyses involving up to 36K subjects (52). For instance, genetic variation in the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) has well-known effects on LDL-cholesterol and is a highly plausible coronary disease candidate gene. However, a meta-analysis of 17 studies with at least 500 cases that included 21 331 cases and 47 467 controls estimated the risk of carrying the protective 12 allele (versus 13/ 13 homozygotes) as 0.80 (95% CI 0.70 -0.90) (53); the significance of this association is approximately P \u00bc 0.0005, four orders of magnitude below genome-wide significance. GWAS, even when enhanced by genotype imputation, may not accurately tag specific candidate gene variants [e.g. LPA and rs10455872 (30)]. So, the absence of a GWAS signal cannot be assumed to negate prior candidate or positional cloned genes (8). Indeed, the design of the HumanCVD genecentric SNP array has revealed several novel loci LIPA, IL5, TRIB1 and ABCG5/ABCG8 as well as finally robustly confirming the candidature of APOE (8).",

            "text": "Models of the genetic architecture of complex traits (33) predict that large numbers of small effect susceptibility loci remain to be discovered, some of which should be tractable to well-powered GWAS. The momentum amongst researchers to meta-analyse GWAS data will be sustained as larger consortia (e.g. the recently merged CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium) are formed. They can take full advantage of initiatives such as the Metabochip project, a custom array containing 196 725 SNPs that builds on the CARDIoGRAM stage-1 discovery results. So, it is reasonable to expect that the number of common coronary disease variants will increase, although as each novel variant will be associated with increasingly tiny effects, it seems that the missing heritability gap will never be filled by common variants alone. The compilation of an exhaustive list of human genetic variation through the dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/p rojects/SNP) and HapMap (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) projects is being systematically expanded by the 1000 Genomes project (http://www.1000genomes.org). This is particularly useful for low-frequency variants (minimum allele frequency ,5%), which were largely absent from the early genome-wide SNPs arrays, which were designed to type common variants in GWAS. Synthetic associations due to tagging of rare variants by common SNPs or haplotypes composed of common SNPs can occasionally be detected (54); this is particularly useful if the rare variant might disrupt gene function (e.g. non-synonymous SNP). Consequently, analyses of imputed genotypes derived from the 1000 genomes project are an immediate research priority. This is encouraged by the detection of a haplotype association with coronary disease (55) that subsequently was partially explained as a synthetic association to an LPA SNP (30). Imputation-based analysis will be complemented by wholegenome or exome resequencing experiments aimed at identifying low-frequency variants and unique high-penetrance mutations; together, these approaches have the potential to reveal novel disease mechanisms.",
