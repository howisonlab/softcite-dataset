            "text": "The large number of experimentally determined protein 3D structures is a rich resource for studying protein function and evolution, and protein structure comparison (PSC) is a key method for such studies. When comparing two protein structures, almost all currently available PSC servers report a single and sequential (i.e. topological) alignment, whereas the existence of good alternative alignments, including those involving permutations (i.e. non-sequential or non-topological alignments), is well known. We have recently developed a novel PSC method that can detect alternative alignments of statistical significance (alignment similarity P-value ,10 \u00c05), including structural permutations at all levels of complexity. OPAAS, the server of this PSC method freely accessible at our website (http:// opaas.ibms.sinica.edu.tw), provides an easy-toread hierarchical layout of output to display detailed information on all of the significant alternative alignments detected. Because these alternative alignments can offer a more complete picture on the structural, evolutionary and functional relationship between two proteins, OPAAS can be used in structural bioinformatics research to gain additional insight that is not readily provided by existing PSC servers.",

These efforts are needed not only to meet new scientific challenges but also to benefit maximally from the large number of new structures now pouring in from structural genomics projects (7,8).",

Our method, named OPAAS, which has been detailed elsewhere (21,22), deduces the probabilities of aligning every possible pair of secondary structure elements (SSEs) between two protein structures prior to the search for a solution of their alignment. This deduction allows the ready identification of most, though not all, statistically significant alignment solutions, many of which being distinct alternatives to the 'optimal' solution, the target of conventional PSC operations. As we reported previously from a study of all-against-all database comparisons (22), about half of the alternative alignments were detectable only when permutation, i.e. non-topological alignment, was allowed. Moreover, many of the permuted alignments exhibited a permutation complexity higher than that of circular permutation, meaning that more than two separable regions of the protein structure could be aligned non-sequentially. To quantitatively measure the level of permutation complexity for all the alignments, we devised a permutation index (PI) as follows:",

User can sort the table by the field selected (user guide 3.2.2) and download this table either as a plain text file or a comma separated values format file (user guide 3.2.3). User also can click on the matched entry to view details of each alignment solution, which will have exactly the same output as that from using the function of '2 chains alignment' (user guide 3.2.4; see below). For the output of the last two input options, an e-mail of search result with the subject title 'OPAAS result' will be sent back to the e-mail address supplied (user guide 3.3). The e-mail contains a table of search result like that of the first input option described above, but to interactively view details of individual alignment solution, the second function, described below, needs to be separately invoked.",

            "text": "The best way to compare two protein structures often depends on the question being asked (6), so having a server like OPAAS that can simultaneously analyze solutions beyond the 'optimal' alignment is useful. Although most of the published PSC algorithms can be modified to offer similar capability, to our knowledge, only two PSC servers give user the option to see alternative alignments: Prosup (25) and SARF2 (26), but Prosup is limited to topological alignments and neither offers one-against-all database searching service. Moreover, with an intuitive hierarchical layout of the com-parison results and optional parameter settings to view most significant alignments (e.g. with similarity P-value set at 10 \u00c05 , a typical comparison usually resulted in <5 such solutions), an informative summary that could lead to unexpected insight from unexpected alternative alignments is effectively produced. The main limitation of OPAAS, at its current version, arose from a compromise to trade for computational efficiency, which dictates that a structure must possess at least three SSEs to be compared (21,22); elimination of this limitation is in progress. Significantly, our server allows database search with an efficiency comparable that of the popular CE server (27), despite ours being run on a personal computer (Pentium IV) and being asked to find alternative alignments. The source code of OPAAS is also available at the server for free download for standalone computations and for incorporation of structure database other than SCOP.",
