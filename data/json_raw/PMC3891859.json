            "text": "Aggressive periodontitis is characterized by a rapid loss of periodontal attachment and alveolar bone. It commonly affects young adults [1][2][3]. As opposed to chronic periodontitis, the amount of biofilm and calculus accumulation in aggressive periodontitis is inconsistent with the severity and rate of progression of the periodontal destruction. These infections are subdivided into localized and generalized forms, according to the extent of the periodontal destruction [4]. The stringent age requirement used previously for diagnosis of earlyonset periodontitis is no longer considered to be essential [5]. Even though there have been attempts to analyze aggressive periodontitis biochemically and microbiologically, there is no specific way to screen for the disease. Currently, early detection depends primarily on clinical and radiographic examination [1,5].",

            "text": "Many reports have discussed host susceptibility factors, including family aggregation, single nucleotide polymorphisms, polymorphonuclear neutrophils, antibodies to bacteria, smoking, stress, a local contributing factor (root morphology), and herpes virus infections [6]. Anatomic variations in teeth, such as cervical enamel projections, enamel pearls, intermediate bifurcation ridges, and root grooves have been regarded as etiologic cofactors in this destructive periodontal disease process [7]. It has been shown that molars are more vulnerable to attachment loss and are more frequently extracted [8][9][10]. Anatomical variations in molar root form may favor plaque retention in these teeth and may contribute to an unfavorable crown-root ratio, resulting in increased susceptibility to loosening when they are subjected to heavy occlusal force [11]. Meng et al. [6] indicated that root shape abnormalities can be a susceptibility factor in the development of aggressive periodontitis and suggested root shape classification. Kim [12] reported that the ratio of root abnormalities was 1.76 times higher in aggressive periodontitis patients than in normal patients.",

However, distinguishing between the two forms in clinical practice remains problematic.

Familial aggregation is also largely unhelpful [16]. A recent systematic review of the literature concluded that there is no evidence that the subgingival etiological factors in chronic periodontitis are substantially different from those of corresponding lesions in aggressive periodontitis [17]. Instead, it is generally accepted that the variation in susceptibility to periodontitis and types of disease are largely due to host factors [18]. In treating patients with aggressive periodontitis, therefore, early and aggressive treatment measures are more important than an investigation of etiology.",

Albandar and Tinoco [19] reported that the prevalence of aggressive periodontitis was 10% in African-Americans, 5% in Hispanics, and 1.3% in white United States adolescents between 13 and 17 years of age. Low prevalence rates ranging between 0.1% and 0.2% have been reported in Europe [20]. In Japan, Kowashi [21] reported a 0.47% prevalence of aggressive periodontal disease in subjects between 19 and 28 years of age. The data from China showed the prevalence of aggressive periodontitis to vary between 0.12% and 0.47% in different areas of the country [22]. Of the surveyed initial 3,284 patients, 66 patients were provisionally assumed to have aggressive periodontitis (2.01% prevalence) with a mean age of 34.32, which was somewhat higher than that found in previous clinical studies [23]. It seems that this is because the subjects were patients who presented to the hospital rather than youths without symptoms. Considering an asymptomatic progression period and delay in patients visiting the hospital, we applied less strict criteria for age, especially since age is not a critical diagnostic criterion for aggressive periodontitis.",

The most frequently missing teeth in the current study were the maxillary first molars (21.21%) and the mandibular second molars (15.15%). In the evaluation of tooth mortality, a high attachment loss of molars seems to lead to high tooth loss. We can assume that the high percentage of molar tooth loss might be because the molars had additional susceptibility factors such as occlusal interference, hygienic difficulty, and abnormal root form. Further epidemiologic studies of larger populations, comparing them with normal and chronic periodontitis subjects, are needed to assess the exact prevalence and pattern of aggressive periodontitis in Korea."

            "text": "The shape, length, and spread of molar roots are important factors in tooth prognosis, as they can affect the anchorage and stability of molars. Molar root fusion is one of the most common anomalies in root morphological development [8,11]. Root fusion (type V) was the commonest anomaly in both the maxilla and mandible, and showed the highest prevalence in the second molars in this study. Ross and Evanchik [11] reported that a relatively high proportion of Europeans (70%) had one or more maxillary molars and 54% had one or more mandibular molars with fused roots. In the studies of Choi et al. [28] and Ryu et al. [29], root fusion demonstrated higher prevalence in the maxilla than mandible, and was the highest in the second maxillary molar. When we analyzed the degree of periodontal tissue destruction according to root shape, the second molars with root fusion (type V) had a greater risk of increased probing depth and periodontal attachment loss. In the correlation of root fusion and local inflammation, Choi et al. [28] reported a significance increase in clinical indexprobing depth, gingival index, and tooth mobility in both the maxilla and mandible. Likewise, Hou and Tsai [8,30] described the correlation between root fusion and periodontal disease in a Chinese population. Negative characteristics of molars with root fusion, such as an unfavorable crown-to-root ratio, short root length, and a taper-shaped root, may offer less resistance to heavy occlusal loads and/or torque forces. This evidence suggests that molar root fusion may ultimately accelerate periodontal tissue destruction. However, Hou and Tsai's study was not conducted in patients with aggressive periodontitis. Given the similar results of the present study, we can cautiously infer that a fused root can be a contributing factor in disease progression of aggressive periodontitis as well as of chronic periodontitis.",
