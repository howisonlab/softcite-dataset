Most probable number (MPN) counts varied between 7.1 x 10 8 and 6.6 x 10 9 bacteria/g volatile suspended solids VSS (Methanogenic Reactor 1) and 7.2 x 10 6 and 6.4 x 10 7 bacteria/g (VSS) (Methanogenic Reactor 2). Metabolites detected in the highest positive MPN dilutions in both reactors were mostly acetate, propionate, isovalerate and, in some cases, negligible concentrations of butyrate. Using the highest positive dilutions of MPN counts, 50 dominant strains were isolated from both reactors, and 12 strains were selected for sequencing their 16S rRNA gene based on their phenotypic characteristics. The small-subunit rRNA gene sequences indicated that these strains were affiliated to the families Propionibacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae and Syntrophomonadaceae in the low G + C gram-positive group and Desulfovibrio spp. in the class \u03b4-Proteobacteria. The main metabolites detected in the highest positive dilutions of MPN and the presence of Syntrophomonadaceae indicate the effect of the syntrophic associations on the bioconversion of these substrates in methanogenic reactors. Additionally, the potential utilization of external electron acceptors for the complete degradation of amino acids by Clostridium strains confirms the relevance of these acceptors in the transformation of peptides and amino acids in these systems."

Peptidolytic microbial community of brewery industries The relative abundance and the role of peptide-degrading communities in methanogenic reactors have been largely ignored. Although proteins and peptides are an important component of the wastes produced by the food industries, the anaerobic organisms that degrade these wastes in UASB reactors are still not well characterized (29, 39). In anaerobic reactors, proteins are hydrolyzed down to peptides and amino acids, which are fermented to volatile fatty acids and finally converted to methane and carbon dioxide . All these processes take place due to the interactions between microbial populations. Knowledge of microbial community associated to a specific role is relevant to optimize the anaerobic digestion process and increase the stability of the process. The isolation of peptide and aminoacidolytic species has shed light on their complex relations and interactions and has brought into focus the importance of their study in order to enhance the control strategies of the anaerobic reactors. The objective of this study was, therefore, to quantify the most probable number (MPN) of peptide-degrading microorganisms on methanogenic reactors treating brewery wastewater, and to identify, from the highest positive MPN dilutions, the dominant communities of peptide and amino acid degrading microorganisms and their main physiological characteristics."

The dependent variable (number of microorganisms) was transformed using the log 10 function in order to reduce the variation coefficient and to apply parametric statistics. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The efficiency on removal of COD in UASB reactors ranged between 81 and 92% during the study. The pH values fluctuated between 6.8 and 7.0. The ratio of volatile fatty acids: alkalinity (VFA:Alk) was around 0.84 , indicating high values for VFA. The temperature varied between 28 and 31\u00b0C. Microbiological Analysis Most probable number (MPN) counts varied between 7.1 x 10 8 and 6.6 x 10 9 bacteria/g VSS (Reactor 1) and 7.2 x 10 6 and 6.4 x 10 7 bacteria/g VSS (Reactor 2) (Tables 1 and 2). Variance analysis (level of confidence of 95%) did not show a significant influence of substrates or thiosulfate over the peptide-degrading population density in both reactors (p > 0.05). Significant changes in the count values through time were not observed. The two-phase anaerobic digesters allow enrichment for different bacteria in each acidogenic and methanogenic reactor linked to the available substrates and operational conditions (24). In our study, high microbial counts of peptide-degrading microorganisms obtained indicate that degradation of peptides is an important metabolic activity in the methanogenic reactors."

In our study, the formation of VFA can be related to the degradation of amino acids in the presence of thiosulfate as electron acceptor or in syntrophic association with hydrogenotrophic methanogenic bacteria coming from the initial inocula. In the thiosulfate series, sulfide values between 5 and 8 mM were detected, indicating its reduction during the oxidation of carbon sources. Additionally, in absence of thiosulfate, a low concentration of methane was detected in the highest positive dilutions. On the other hand, it has been established that the fast growing peptidolytic organisms that do not depend on syntrophic associations produce butyrate as the main metabolite (28). The negligible concentrations of butyrate obtained in our counts and the fact that none of the 50 isolated strains produced butyrate as final metabolite, help to confirm that these dominant peptide-degrading bacteria, that utilize peptide and/or amino acids as the sole carbon and energy source can depend on syntrophic associations or final electron acceptors. Isolation of dominant peptidolytic bacteria During the last sampling event, 50 strains with different morphological characteristics were isolated from both reactors: Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacilli, motile and nonmotile, spore and non-spore forming, single or paired, in chains or in groups. The isolated strains were grouped by their phenotypic characteristics, such as Gram stain, strict anaerobiosis, spore formation, motility and degradation of peptides and / or amino acids. Subsequently, some of these microorganisms were selected for sequenciation and analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Finally, 12 microorganisms named M-1, MD-4, Ser-1, Ser-2, Ala-1, Val-6, Gela-Thio, Gela, MG-2, B2-2M, MP-6, e Ile-2 were evaluated. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence grouped these strains (Figure 1) into three phyla: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Four strains isolated from the series without thiosulfate and identified as Desulfovibrio vulgaris (strains M-1 and MD-4) and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (strains Ser-1 and Ser-2) belong to the class \u03b4-Proteobacteria. These strains fermented serine in absence of an external electron acceptor, producing acetate as the main metabolite. The presence of peptide and amino acid degraders via fermentation of the genus Desulfovibrio in, anaerobic reactors has been widely reported (4, 20, 24). The presence of SRB in the highest positive dilutions of the microbial counts in this study would indicate their possible role in the fermentation of amino acids in methanogenic reactors where sulfate appears at low concentrations (values of sulfate detected ranged from 4 to 29 mg.l -1 in both reactors). Strains MP-6 and B2-2M, belonging to the phylum non-motile and mesophilic. Strain MP-6 produces acetate and propionate from glucose, and ferments yeast extract but does not use external electron acceptors. Strain B2-2M produces acetate and traces of ethanol from glucose, it also ferments casaminoacids, peptone, pepticase, arginine and yeast extract, and it is able to reduce the elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide. Based on the analysis of the 16S rRNA gene both strains are close to the clone B2, isolated from a microbial enrichment with propionate from an D\u00edaz, C. et al.Peptidolytic microbial community of brewery industries anaerobic reactor (31) (98% similarity) and also related toPropionibacterium lymphophilum with 93% of similarity."

Bootstrap values (expressed as percentages of 1,000 replications) above 95% are shown at branch points (Bar: 0.1 substitutions per nucleotide position).Phylum Firmicutes was represented by three different families (Clostridiaceae, Eubacteriaceae, and Syntrophomonadaceae). The majority of strains related to the degradation of proteins and/amino acids are affiliated to this phylum. These organisms could play a central role in the degradation of proteins, peptides and amino acids as reported by 39 (2005) and indicated by our own results. Strain Ala-1 belongs to the family Eubacteriaceae and was identified as . et al. Peptidolytic microbial community of brewery industries Eubacterium contortum (99% of similarity). This strain is strictly anaerobic, mesophilic and saccharolytic, but does not degrade casamino acids, pepticase or peptone and does not use external electron acceptors. Although the family Eubacteriaceae includes species such as Eubacterium acidaminophilum capable of using aminoacids and peptides (45), strain Ala-1 did not degrade peptides or amino acids. This strain probably grew at the expense of the metabolites produced by other organisms in the highest positive dilutions of the counts. Strains Gela-Thio, MG-2 and Val-6 belong to the family Clostridiaceae and share similarity percentages of 98, 99 and 95% with C. tunisiense (40), C. thiosulfatireducens (21) and C. neopropionicum, respectively. Strains Gela-Thio, Val-6 and MG-2 are strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, asaccharolytic and ferment peptides and amino acids mainly producing acetate and propionate. As electron acceptors, strains Gela-Thio and Val-6 use elemental sulfur and strain MG-2 uses thiosulfate. Based on the similarity of 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain Gela-Thio is identified as C. tunisiense, and strain MG-2 as C. thiosulfatireducens. The value of similarity between strain Val-6 and C. neopropionicum and their phenotypic differences do not allow identifying strain Val-6 as C. neopropionicum. Our results demonstrate that isolates in presence of electron acceptors (elemental sulfur or thiosulfate) can degrade amino acids via oxidative deamination. These external electron acceptors are important in the degradation of amino acids since they remove the reducing equivalents formed during their degradation. This mechanism has been reported in anaerobic bacteria such as Thermoanaerobacter spp. and Dethiosulfovibrio spp. (13, 25). Strain MG-2, besides using thiosulfate as final electron acceptor, also uses the Stickland reaction to degrade amino acids. Strain Val-6 could be identified as a new species of the genus Clostridium, according to the analysis of their 16S rRNA sequence and observed phenotypic differences, but further studies are needed in order to confirm this hypothesis. Strains Gela (Figure 2) and Ile-2 belong to the family Syntrophomonadaceae, which includes a group of anaerobes that commonly grow in syntrophic associations with hydrogen and formate using methanogens. Strain Gela is strictly anaerobic, thermophilic (optimum growth at 50\u00baC), motile, non-spore forming and saccharolytic. This strain fermented amino acids (serine, threonine, histidine, glutamate, valine, isoleucine, leucine, and arginine) and peptides (casamino acids, peptone and yeast extract) and reduced elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide as external electron acceptor.

Peptidolytic microbial community of brewery industries Interestingly, in a reactor fed with bovine serum albumin, when the growth of methanogenic microorganisms was favored, the dominant populations were related to the genus Aminobacterium (39) that could use syntrophic associations to degrade substrates(6). Our study also concludes that in theabsence of methanogenic organisms, the degradation pathway of peptide and amino acids is linked to fast growing organisms of the genus Clostridium. Recently, a new example of an asaccharolytic amino acid degrading bacterium within the phylum 'Synergistetes' named Cloacibacillus evryensis was reported by 16. (2008), from an anaerobic sludge digester, indicating its role in this kind of ecosystems. The organisms of the division Synergistes that are phylogenetically related to the family Syntrophomonadaceae, share the ability to degrade amino acids (18), whether by syntrophic associations or by the presence of an external electron acceptor. It was pointed out that in absence of either of these mechanisms, there is a relationship between phylogeny and function among members of this division, related to the conversion of peptides and amino acids in anaerobic ecosystems (42). CONCLUSIONS These methanogenic reactors exhibit an important anaerobic community of the domain Bacteria. Using conventional techniques, we identified peptide and/or amino acid degrading microorganisms and their activities in anaerobic reactors. The analysis of metabolites produced and the presence of species of microorganisms of the family Syntrophomonadaceae, strains Ile-2 and Gela, indicates the possible effect of the syntrophic associations on the bioconversion of these substrates in methanogenic reactors. Furthermore, the utilization of external electron acceptors for the complete degradation of amino acids by strains Val-6, MG-2 and Gela-Thio confirms the relevance of these acceptors in the transformation of peptides and amino acids in these anaerobic systems.
