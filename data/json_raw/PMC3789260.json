            "text": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a gene that, upon mutation, causes autosomal-dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that Snapin, a SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein-25) interacting protein, interacts with LRRK2. An in vitro kinase assay exhibited that Snapin is phosphorylated by LRRK2. A glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay showed that LRRK2 may interact with Snapin via its Ras-of-complex (ROC) and N-terminal domains, with no significant difference on interaction of Snapin with LRRK2 wild type (WT) or its pathogenic mutants. Further analysis by mutation study revealed that Threonine 117 of Snapin is one of the sites phosphorylated by LRRK2. Furthermore, a Snapin T117D phosphomimetic mutant decreased its interaction with SNAP-25 in the GST pull-down assay. SNAP-25 is a component of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment protein REceptor) complex and is critical for the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Incubation of rat brain lysate with recombinant Snapin T117D, but not WT, protein caused decreased interaction of synaptotagmin with the SNARE complex based on a co-immunoprecipitation assay. We further found that LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Snapin in the hippocampal neurons resulted in a decrease in the number of readily releasable vesicles and the extent of exocytotic release. Combined, these data suggest that LRRK2 may regulate neurotransmitter release via control of Snapin function by inhibitory phosphorylation."

            "text": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been identified as a gene corresponding to PARK8, a locus causing familial Parkinson's disease (PD) in an autosomal-dominant manner. 1,2 PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and affects more than 1% of people older than 65 years. LRRK2 is a large protein consisting of 2527 amino acids and contains active GTPase and functional kinase domains, with protein interaction domains including leucine-rich repeat and WD40. [1][2][3][4] Each of these functional GTPase and kinase domains may be critical for LRRK2 functions and PD pathogenesis, given that the two most prevalent PD-specific mutations among LRRK2 mutations, G2019S and R1441C/G, were mapped in the kinase and GTPase domains, respectively. 1, 2,5 Overexpression of wild-type (WT) or PD-specific mutants of LRKK2 exhibited increased cellular protein aggregations, [6][7][8] shortening of neurite length, and decrease of neurite branch number during neurite outgrowth, 9,10 as well as enhanced, oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity. [11][12][13] In most studies, these phenotypes were intensified in cells expressing mutants, especially G2019S, which showed increased kinase activity, compared to cells expressing WT. 10,[14][15][16] Therefore, that part of LRRK2 research conducted thus far has focused on identifying its kinase substrates with the goals of elucidating the PD-pathogenic mechanism and developing PD therapeutics.",

Snapin was originally reported as a SNAP-25-binding protein that is associated with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex proteins. 28 In Snapin knockout mice, association of SNAP-25 with synaptotagmin-1 was impaired and calcium-dependent exocytosis was significantly reduced. 29 Recent studies reported that in Snapin knockout mice, late endocytic proteins were increased 30 and that synaptic vesicle fusion was desynchronized. 31 In addition, Snapin was also reported to be an important link between the aquaporin water channel and the target SNARE complex, 32 and as a regulator of late endosomal transport, which is critical for autophagy-lysosomal function in neurons. 33 It was also reported that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylated Snapin at its Ser50 residue, and increased both its binding of SNAP-25 and interaction of synaptotagmin-1 with the SNARE complex. 34 The results from these studies implied that Snapin is a critical protein to regulate synaptic vesicle trafficking and the fusion of synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane. A recent study showed that Snapin also functions in fine-tuning of neurite outgrowth via interaction with AC6 (type VI adenylyl cyclase), 35 suggesting that Snapin negatively regulates neurite outgrowth.",

Time-lapse images were acquired every 5 s for 4 min using a back-illuminated Andor iXon 897 EMCCD camera (Andor Technologies, Belfast, Northern Ireland) driven by MetaMorph Imaging software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). From the fourth frame, neurons were stimulated (1 ms, 20-50 V, bipolar) using an A310 Accupulser current stimulator (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) to mimic action potential generation. Quantitative measurement of fluorescence intensity at individual boutons was obtained by averaging a selected area of pixel intensities using MetaMorph software. Individual regions were selected by hand. Then, rectangular regions of interest were drawn around the synaptic boutons, and average intensities were calculated. Large puncta, typically representative of smaller synapse clusters, were rejected during the selection procedure. The center of intensity of each synapse was calculated to correct for any image shift over the course of the experiment. Fluorescence was expressed in intensity units that correspond to fluorescence values averaged over all pixels within the region of interest. Changes in net fluorescence were obtained by subtracting the average intensity of the first four frames (F 0 ) from the intensity of each frame (F t ) for individual boutons. They were then normalized to the maximum fluorescence intensity (F max \u00c0F 0 ) and averaged. For the exocytosis assays, neurons were preincubated with bafilomycin A1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) for 60 s to block re-acidification and stimulated for 30 s at 20 Hz/600 action potentials (APs), a combination, which is known to totally deplete the recycling pool of vesicles. 44 Bafilomycin A1 was dissolved in Me 2 SO at 0.2 mM and diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 mM prior to the experiments. Bafilomycin A1 was applied throughout the fluorescence measurements.",

We employed yeast two-hybrid screening to isolate proteins interacting with LRRK2, and tried to deduce LRRK2's function by identifying the functions of the LRRK2-interacting proteins. Snapin (SNAP-25-interacting protein) was originally isolated as an LRRK2-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening using regions from ROC to the kinase (GK) domain or containing the WD40 domain as baits. Both screenings yielded multiple identical Snapin clones whose open reading frame started at the 33rd amino acid.

The results showed that LRRK2 phosphorylated Snapin in the order of G2019S4WT, and this order was also observed in LRRK2 autophosphorylation, as previously reported (Figure 1a). 3,15,24 As expected, the kinase dead mutant D1994A 11 showed weaker phosphorylation of Snapin and no autophosphorylation, a pattern similar to the reaction with the vector control ( Figure 1a). The weak phosphorylation of Snapin observed in the vector and D1994A lanes might be derived from other kinases non-specifically immunoprecipitated by the myc antibody (Figures 1ai and iii, lanes Recombinant Snapin protein was expressed in E. coli as His-tagged fusion protein and isolated by affinity chromatography with nickel resin.

Using the purified Snapin proteins, we performed an in vitro kinase assay with the GST-LRRK2 WT or G2019S proteins. The results showed that phosphorylation of T117A by the recombinant GST-LRRK2 G2019S proteins was almost, but not completely, eradicated, whereas that of T20A remained at a level similar to that of WT.

Figure 4a exhibits that Snapin T117D very weakly interacted with GST-SNAP-25 in comparison with interaction of Snapin WT and T117A. This suggested that the phosphorylation of Snapin T117 inhibited the interaction of SNAP-25 with Snapin.

The immunoprecipitates were analyzed using western blot analysis with synaptotagmin-1 antibody. Figure 5 shows that Snapin WT increased the association of synaptotagmin-1 with the core SNARE complex. In contrast, T117D-mutant protein decreased the association. The amount of each component of the SNARE complex was similar except for SNAP-25, whose interaction with syntaxin might be decreased by the addition of Snapin. Phosphorylation of Snapin by leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) causes a decrease of interaction with SNAP-25. (a) Snapin T117D-mutant mimicking phosphorylation by LRRK2 interacts with SNAP-25 more weakly than the wild type (WT). Recombinant Flagtagged Snapin WT and indicated mutant proteins were subjected to a GST pull-down assay using GST-SNAP-25 and detected by western blot analysis using anti-Flag antibody. Coomassie blue staining of GST and GST-SNAP-25 showed that similar amounts of each protein were used. (b) Snapin WT protein phosphorylated by LRRK2 exhibited weaker interaction with SNAP-25 than the untreated and presumably unphosphorylated Snapin (control). The myc-tagged LRRK2 G2019S was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated by anti-myc antibody. The immunoprecipitated beads were co-incubated with recombinant flag tagged Snapin WT protein with ATP under the in vitro kinase assay conditions. The supernatant was co-incubated with purified GST-SNAP-25 and subjected to a GST pull-down assay and SDS-PAGE. The bound Snapin was detected by anti-flag antibody (Sigma) and the amount was compared to the control transfected with an empty vector (i). The presence of LRRK2 in immunoprecipitates was confirmed by anti-myc antibody (ii). Coomassie blue staining (iii) confirmed that equal amounts of GST-SANP25 protein were used for both incubations (control and G2019S). (c) Interaction of SNAP25 with Snapin was weaker in G2019S transgenic (TG) than in a control (C) mouse brain lysate. Whole brain lysates were prepared from both G2019S TG and normal control mice and immunoprecipitated with SNAP25 antibody. The amount of Snapin in each brain lysates (20% input) was shown with Snapin antibody (Abnova, 1:500 dilution, Snapin-low). The immunoprecipitates, which showed no signal under the diluted condition above, were subjected to western blot analysis with more concentrated Snapin antibody (Abnova, 1:50 dilution, Snapin-high).

We cotransfected WT Snapin alone, T117D alone, G2019S and WT Snapin or D1994A and WT Snapin with vGpH in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. 43 The vesicles of a synapse are organized into three distinct pools, two of which recycle (readily releasable pool (RRP) and a reserve pool), and one which normally does not (resting pool). The vesicles of the RRP are known to be docked at the plasma membrane, ready for immediate release upon stimulation. 44 After the RRP has been depleted, continued release occurs from the reserve pool. The amplitude of the response to a train of 40 APs at 20 Hz corresponds to the size of the RRP of the synaptic vesicles. Those recycling vesicles released by a stimulus of 1800 APs at 20 Hz after the addition of bafilomycin A1, a V-type ATPase inhibitor that blocks acidification of endocytosed synaptic vesicles, represent the remainder of the total recycling pool. 44,53 The resting pool of vesicles, which are refractory to stimulation and normally do not participate in recycling, can be uncovered by adding NH 4 Cl to trap all the vesicles in an alkaline state and hence unquench all acidic vesicles that have not been released (Figure 6a  44,53 ).",

However, the various functions of interaction partners also suggest a possibility that Snapin might non-specifically interact with these proteins. 52 However, a Snapin knockout animal model exhibited impaired calcium-dependent exocytosis of large dense-core vesicles in chromaffin cells, confirming specific physiological roles of Snapin in synaptic vesicle trafficking. 29 Until now, PKA and casein kinase 1d were known to phosphorylate Snapin. 40,50 We report here LRRK2 as another Snapin kinase. One of the phosphorylation sites of Snapin by LRRK2 was identified as threonine 117. Although we identified this site based on the conserved sequences for LRRK2's phosphorylation site, 46 a recent study on LRRK2's phosphorylation site suggested that LRRK2 phosphorylates amino acids whose surrounding regions have high pI values, rather than the conserved amino-acid sequences. 58 The pI of the peptide containing the 113rd amino acid to 121st amino acids (VAKETARRR) of Snapin is 11.7 (calculated by a program from http://web.expasy.org/protparam/), confirming that threonine 117 is acceptable as a phosphorylation site of LRRK2 regardless of the rule that is applied. 46,58 However, LRRK2's phosphorylated motif sequence is not well conserved. Several studies have reported that LRRK2 could phosphorylate threonine or even serine at sites unrelated to the reported F/Y-X-T-X-R/K threonine sites. 59,60 Therefore, it is possible that serines or threonines in Snapin are phosphorylated by LRRK2 in addition to T117, because T117A mutant proteins were still weakly phosphorylated by LRRK2 in the in vitro kinase assay (Figure 1d). We found that Snapin T117D did not significantly affect synaptic vesicle composition and extent of exocytosis, and this might be due to the presence of additional phosphorylation sites in Snapin by LRRK2 ( Figure 6b).",

Consistent with these previous findings, we also found that LRRK2mediated phosphorylation of Snapin decreased interaction of synaptotagmin with the core SNARE complex ( Figure 5). This subsequently resulted in a reduced RRP fraction and extent of exocytosis, suggesting that LRRK2 is another negative regulator of the Snapin and SNAP-25 interaction during synaptic transmission. Snapin has been reported to directly interact with synaptotagmin 31 in addition to indirect interaction via SNAP25. Whether Snapin S50D protein enhances its direct interaction with synaptotagmin is yet unknown.

In contrast, SNAP-25 is known as a positive regulator of neurite length. 62 Recently, type VI adenylyl cyclase (AC6) was reported as a Snapin-interacting protein and a suppressor of neurite extension. 63 Downregulation of Snapin or overexpression of SNAP-25 reversed neurite shortening by AC6. 63 Investigation of the effect of LRRK2-mediated Snapin phosphorylation on neurite length could be of further interest.",
