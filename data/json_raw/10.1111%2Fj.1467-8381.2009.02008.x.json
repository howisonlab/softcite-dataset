These strategies include: (i) the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA: a being-left-alone strategy); (ii) an ASEAN Hub RTA (a hub-and-spoke type of overlapping RTA strategy); (iii) the AFTA versus a China-Japan-Korea RTA (a duplicating or competing RTA strategy); and (iv) an ASEAN+3 RTA (an expansionary RTA strategy). We find that an expansionary ASEAN+3 RTA could be a sustainable policy option because the members' gains would be significantly positive, with more equitably distributed gains between members than when using other strategies. The effect on world welfare would also be positive and the negative effect on nonmembers would not be very strong. More interestingly, if the East Asian countries cooperate with Pacific Basin countries to form an APEC-level RTA, such as a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific, the extension of the regional trade bloc might be considered a more desirable policy option than the proposed East Asian RTAs for East Asian economies, even though countries excluded from the free trade area of the Asia Pacific are worse off.",

In this paper, we narrowly define East Asia by including ASEAN 10 countries in Southeast Asia and China, Japan and Korea in Northeast Asia. In addition, we treat the ASEAN 10 countries as a single economy. Therefore, there exist 4 individual East Asian economies in this paper; namely, the ASEAN+3, which includes ASEAN, China, Japan and Korea. 2. For market-driven regionalization, see Urata (2006). For more recent overviews of East Asian regionalism, see ADB (2008) and Kawai and Wignaraja (2008). 3. For proliferating RTAs in East Asia, see JETRO (2003), Lu (2003), Kawai (2004), Feridhanusetyawan (2005) and Lee and Park (2005). 4. Theoretically, Kemp and Wan (1976) prove the possibility of Pareto-improving customs unions if there is a system of internal transfer of gains from free trade only between members, along with a common external tariff scheme. 5. As point out by the referee, the seriousness of the damage, that is, the significance of the negative effect on nonmembers, is a matter of subjective judgment. We clarify the significance (X) as follows: strongly (or significantly) negative if X < \u2212 1%, negative if \u2212 1% \u2264 X < \u2212 0.1% and insignificant if \u2212 0.1% \u2264 X < 0%.",

To answer this, we should consider the interests of all the parties involved, individually and altogether. In this paper, we describe our quantitative examination of the sustainability of proposed East Asian RTAs with respect to the abovementioned three conditions: (i) country-specific gains; (ii) distribution of gains between members; and (iii) global welfare gains. More specifically, we quantitatively evaluate the likely effect of the proposed strategies on the East Asian economies with respect to the equivalent variation of welfare, real GDP, exports, imports and income terms of trade by applying a multi-country and a multi-sector CGE model. 9 The CGE model analysis has the advantage of measuring the welfare effect directly and of comparing the possible outcomes of different scenarios while maintaining logical consistency even though the complicated ex-ante simulation methodology sometimes misspecifies the model economy.",

            "text": "Both intra-regional and inter-regional trade agreements are proliferating in East Asia, as shown in Table 1. As briefly described in Park and Park (2008), 6. For the general concept of the hub-and-spoke RTA, see Lloyd (2002), Umemoto (2003) and Baldwin (2004). 7. If there is a first mover advantage, as suggested in Freund (2000), forming a new RTA will be preferable to joining an existing RTA. 8. See Baldwin (1993) for the domino effect of regionalism. 9. For East Asian RTAs with CGE models, see McKibbin (1998), Scollay and Gilbert (2001), Urata andKiyota (2003), McKibbin et al. (2004), Sulamaa and Widgr\u00e9n (2005), Zhai (2006), Park (2006), Wignaraja (2007, 2008) and Lee and van der Mensbrugghe (2007).  the RTAs that include countries in East Asia have some distinguishing characteristics. First, the trend of reducing or eliminating trade barriers between members is relatively new in East Asia. Most of the East Asian countries, especially countries in Northeast Asia, have been well-known to prefer nondiscriminatory multilateral liberalization efforts rather than discriminatory regional liberalization policies. However, after realizing the importance of regional economic cooperation as a result of the East Asian financial crisis in 1997, East Asian countries have changed their policy stance from favoring a global approach to favoring a regional approach. As in Table 1, among the 34 RTAs implemented or signed that include East Asian countries, 33 RTAs were implemented after the crisis. Only the AFTA was established prior to the crisis. Second, most of RTAs in East Asia have taken a form of bilateral negotiation similar to the worldwide trend of seeking a lower and easier negotiation cost even though the gains from freer trade are limited. Third, there has been no distinction between intra-regional and inter-regional partnerships. Recent innovations in information and communication technology have resulted in significantly reduced transaction costs and have made geographical distance relatively less important. Pre-RTA economic interdependence has been important in the consideration of the right partners to approach for the formation of RTA. Fourth, with respect to the partnership issue of RTA, most East Asian RTAs have taken the form of huband-spoke overlapping RTA, which could cause a 'spaghetti bowl' phenomenon. 10 In particular, ASEAN, Singapore and Thailand have been very aggressive in pursuing leading roles in the formation of RTA. Fifth, there has been very slow progress in the expansionary path of RTA, which could trigger a domino effect of regionalism.",

The currently proliferating East Asian RTAs have been initiated mostly by the private sector, which is oriented toward profit-seeking, unlike in Europe, where RTAs have generally been formed based on political and ideological harmonization. This makes the formation of an institutional framework for regional integration difficult in East Asia. In addition, the hub-and-spoke type of many overlapping RTAs in East Asia could result in the spaghetti bowl phenomenon of discriminatory trade blocs, which have the potential to inhibit global free trade. Park (2006) and Lee and van der Mensbrugghe (2007) quantitatively evaluate the effects of some proposed East Asian RTAs by applying a static and a dynamic CGE model analysis, respectively. Their findings strongly support the ASEAN+3 RTA as the best policy strategy for East Asian countries to take. In particular, Park (2006) proposes that East Asian RTAs should take expansionary paths to establish global free trade rather than competing to achieve the first mover advantage. Baldwin (2004) and Zhai (2006) also highlight the negative welfare effect expected from overlapping RTAs in East Asia. Kawai (2007) and Kawai and Wignaraja (2007) suggest that either an ASEAN+3 (the East Asian Summit countries) or an ASEAN+6 (including Australia, New Zealand and India) FTA would be economically desirable in East Asia and would maximize the positive gains from trade liberalization and minimize the negative 'noodle bowl' effects of regionalism. 12",

The answers to these questions can be found by assessing the macroeconomic aggregate effects of the proposed East Asian RTA strategies by applying a traditional static CGE model simulation technique. We have adopted a trade-linked multi-sector and multi-country CGE model to measure the impact of East Asian regional economic integration efforts on welfare, real GDP, exports and income terms of trade. We have carefully selected those four aggregate variables to measure the effectiveness of proposed strategies according to type of RTA for each economy considered. The equivalent variations in welfare have been selected mainly for the consumption effect. Real GDP is used for the production effect. Exports have been chosen for the volume of trade effect. Income terms of trade are another important measure of welfare change. 13 In addition, to support our findings, we report the effect on imports and bilateral trade patterns.",

For each of the scenarios, both import tariffs and export taxes between members were eliminated, but the trade 15. The seven sectors are: agricultural products, food products, extractive industry, light manufacturing, heavy manufacturing, technology-intensive manufacturing, and services. The 27 economies are: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, the rest of Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, the USA, the European Free Trade Association, the Western European countries, and the rest of the world. 16. The GTAP 6 Database is a global database representing the world economy for a given reference year (2001). For more detailed information, see Dimaranan (2006 For the base solution of the model economy, we ran the CGE model without changing its initial condition and derived general equilibrium values for each of the economies in the model. Next, we reestimated the model under different scenarios and recalculated the equilibrium values for each case. Then, we compared the different equilibrium values with the initial base solution in terms of percentage deviation from the base to evaluate the experimental impacts of each scenario on each country. 19 Table 2 provides a comparative summary of regional economic effects of the proposed East Asian RTAs by type of RTA. The aggregate effect of the currently effective AFTA had no significant negative effects on the discriminatory liberalization of the Northeast Asian neighbors, but produced significant enough positive gains to ASEAN members. However, if ASEAN members decide to pursue the ASEAN Hub scenario, which includes three sets of ASEAN+1 FTA, it could raise ASEAN's gains from free trade. ASEAN's welfare and GDP gains could be raised to more than three times that of the AFTA. The negative effects on excluded neighbors could be problematic, although the neighboring countries 18. The trade barriers include both tariff and non-tariff barriers. For import tariffs, trade-weighted ad valorem tariffs include tariff rate quotas and the ad valorem equivalents of specific tariffs. The export taxes cover ordinary export subsidies, export tax equivalents of Agreement on Textiles and Clothing quotas, price undertakings and voluntary export restraints. The protection rates in service sectors are assumed to be zero in the GTAP Database. For more detailed information, visit https:// www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v6/v6_doco.asp. 19. As the referee indicated, the base year for existing RTA, such as the ASEAN-China FTA, should be 2004 or 2005 (right before the year into force in Table 1). However, similar to other hypothetical scenarios in the present paper, the complete elimination of trade barriers between ASEAN and China are assumed and simulated. Of course, we acknowledge this data problem as a limitation.   could increase their exports because of the income effect from the additional GDP gains of ASEAN, with the increase in bilateral trade volume between ASEAN and each of the three Northeast Asian countries. In terms of the negative effects that could be expected from AFTA or the ASEAN Hub scenario, the Northeast Asian neighbors might decide to form their own regional protection strategy against ASEAN by developing a China-Japan-Korea FTA. The trade warfare between the two regions could be harmful to the less-developed ASEAN economy and would enormously benefit the Northeast Asian countries, especially the smallest country, like Korea. However, this duplicating RTA competition might not be beneficial to the world economy. It will cause much lower welfare gains to the world economy than those with the existing AFTA and ASEAN Hub scenario.",

The negative welfare effect of all the four proposed East Asian RTAs on China is a very interesting result which is also highlighted by Zhai (2006). It can be explained by the heavy and increasing intra-regional dependence of imported parts and components to China as a world factory. In addition, East Asian RTAs reallocate resources from the manufacturing industry to the agricultural industry within China and it may deteriorate economic efficiency of the Chinese manufacturing sector resulting in the deterioration of welfare as Zhai (2006) mentioned.",

More specifically, Figure 1 compares the aggregate effects of the four proposed East Asian RTAs on the four regional economies in terms of the four measures. The Figure 1 illustrates which economy is the biggest gainer from each different type of RTA. The ASEAN gains the most from the existing AFTA and an ASEAN Hub scenario. This finding explains why most of the nonmembers of RTAs fear being left alone. This fear motivates nonmembers to jump on the RTA band wagon. This finding explains why countries are competing to be a hub and making a very complicated overlapping RTA map. There is no distinguishing difference in the effects of an AFTA between nonmembers of the RTA but the effects of an ASEAN Hub RTA will cause a relatively better effect on China. The competing Northeast Asian RTA and the expansionary East Asian RTA will distribute relatively more favorable gains to Korea and China when we measure the size of the rectangles. The ASEAN will benefit least of the competing and expansionary RTA strategies. Figure 2 illustrates Table 2 by highlighting which scenario is the best for each of the economies in East Asia in terms of the four measures. For the sake of the ASEAN, the ASEAN Hub RTA is the best and competing with the Northeast Asian neighbors is the worst scenario. For the three Northeast Asian countries, the ASEAN+3 RTA will be the most desirable RTA but it is not much better than the Northeast Asian RTA between the three countries competing against the AFTA. Both the AFTA and ASEAN Hub RTA will be the worst scenarios for the countries in Northeast Asia. Figure 3 illustrates the effect of the East Asian RTAs on the four measures representing each country's gains from free trade. In terms of the welfare effect, there is no Pareto-improving RTA among the four different scenarios possible in East Asia. Reallocating resources from an existing AFTA to any alternative trade bloc may hurt at least one economy in the region. It is mainly because of the strong substitution effect cased by the change in relative prices, especially large country like China. The case of income terms of trade shows the same pattern. However, in terms of the real GDP reflecting the strong income or growth effect relative to the substitution effect, the expansionary ASEAN+3 RTA can be a sustainable scenario where the shift from the AFTA to the bigger trade bloc can make all the participating economies better off. For export promotion raising trade volume, both the ASEAN Hub and the ASEAN+3 RTA can be counted as sustainable RTA strategies.",

As presented in Table 3, all the proposed East Asian RTAs raise 20. Our findings fit very well with some of the rules of thumb in Harrison et al. (2003). They argue that: (i) countries excluded from Preferential Trade Arrangement almost always lose; and (ii) that multilateral trade liberalization results in significantly larger gains to the world than exist with the current network of regional arrangements.  world welfare between a minimum of 0.21 percent in the case of the competing RTAs, including the AFTA and the China-Japan-Korea RTA, and a maximum of 0.98 percent in the case of the ASEAN Hub RTA. The GDP gains range from 0.02 percent for the AFTA to 0.36 percent for the ASEAN+3 RTA. The world trade volume also rises. The expansionary ASEAN+3 RTA can be evaluated as the best strategy for maximizing world output and trade. For the members' welfare, real GDP, and trade as in Table 3, the expansionary ASEAN+3 RTA is also the best strategy for East Asian participants in terms of creating bigger gains in many aspects and more evenly distributed gains between the Southeast and Northeast Asian members. In summary, considering the effects of the ASEAN+3 RTA on members, nonmembers, and the world economy relative to other alternative strategies, the expansionary East Asian RTA-ASEAN+3 FTA-can be effective and sustainable because the effect on members is significantly positive enough and more equitably distributed, the effects on the world welfare is positive enough, and the negative effect on nonmembers is not very strong. In particular, the ASEAN+3 FTA improves members' real GDP by 1.86 percent and hurts nonmembers' real GDP by -0.01 (-0.01358) percent compared to 1.45 percent and -0.01 (-0.01389) percent, respectively, in the case of AFTA.",
