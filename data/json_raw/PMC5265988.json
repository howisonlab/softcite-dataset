            "text": "The proportion of alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in all ONFH patients was 30.7%, with males prevailing among the ONFH patients in mainland China (70.1%). Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), a member of the MMP gene family, encodes the enzyme MMP2, which can promote osteoclast migration, attachment, and bone matrix degradation. In this case-control study, we aimed to investigate the association between MMP2 and the alcohol-induced ONFH in Chinese males. In total, 299 patients with alcohol-induced ONFH and 396 healthy controls were recruited for a case-control association study. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the MMP2 locus were genotyped and examined for their correlation with the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH and treatment response using Pearson x 2 test and unconditional logistic regression analysis. We identified 3 risk alleles for carriers: the allele \"T\" of rs243849 increased the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH in the allele model, the log-additive model without adjustment, and the log-additive model with adjustment for age. Conversely, the genotypes \"CC\" in rs7201 and \"CC\" in rs243832 decreased the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH, as revealed by the recessive model. After the Bonferroni multiple adjustment, no significant association was found. Furthermore, the haplotype analysis showed that the \"TT\" haplotype of MMP2 was more frequent among patients with alcohol-induced ONFH by unconditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for age. In conclusion, there may be an association between MMP2 and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH in North-Chinese males. However, studies on larger populations are needed to confirm this hypothesis; these data may provide a theoretical foundation for future studies.

            "text": "Alcohol-induced ONFH is a type of nontraumatic ONFH caused by chronic and excessive alcohol consumption. The incidence of this condition is increasing in China; data show that males dominate with a 70.1% in mainland China, and that the proportion of alcohol-induced ONFH among all ONFH patients is 30.7%. [5] One previous study reported that when alcohol intake was higher than 400 mL/wk, there was a clear increase in the risk of ONFH. [6] Several pathogenic mechanisms associated with the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH include environmental factors, alcohol intake, dyslipidemia, blood coagulation disorders, and ossification dysfunction of mesenchymal stem cells; however, the exact pathogenesis of this condition is still controversial and unclear. Genetic researches have offered the potential insight into the occurrence and development of alcoholinduced ONFH. Zhang et al [7] confirmed the association between ABCB1 polymorphism and increased ONFH risk. In addition, the association of ONFH with angiogenesis-and hypoxia-related gene polymorphisms, such as IGFBP3, VEGFC, and ACE, has been confirmed [8] . Recent studies suggest that MMP2 may play a key role in the process of bone metabolism and influence the proliferation and/or differentiation of bone marrow stem cells in bone and joint diseases. [9,10] MMP2 is a member of the MMP gene family, which encodes zinc-dependent enzymes capable of cleaving components of the extracellular matrix and molecules involved in signal transduction. The MMP/tissue inhibitor of MMP (MMP/TIMP) pathway has also been found to impact human bone metabolism, [11] while polymorphisms of several genes in the pathway have been related to orthopedic diseases. [12][13][14] Some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MMP2 have been associated with several diseases: for example, rs1053605 is associated with stroke outcome, [15] but not with abdominal aortic aneurysm [16] ; rs243849 is related to ischemic stroke outcome [15] ; the rs243847 variant may increase intracranial aneurysms in Japanese male patients [17] ; 2 SNPs, rs243832 and rs7201, that have a strong linkage disequilibrium (LD), have been associated with endometriosis. [18] However, whether these 5 MMP2 SNPs are associated with alcohol-induced ONFH is still unknown. Therefore, in this case-control study, we aimed to investigate whether the genetic aspect of MMP2 had a protective or riskincreasing nature in the context of alcohol-induced ONFH in Chinese males.",

ONFH was diagnosed by clinical examination and radiographic analysis. Patients underwent anteroposterior and frog view X-ray tests; magnetic resonance imaging was needed to further confirm the ONFH in cases when the patients had no changes observable by X-ray. According to Lee et al [19] , alcohol-induced ONFH patients were those who consumed more than 400 mL of pure ethanol per week. Some patients were excluded from the study for reasons such as disagreeing with the study, consumption of drugs that have an effect on the patients' liver function and lipid metabolism, not meeting the diagnostic criteria of alcohol-induced ONFH, and suffering from chronic diseases synchronously. The person needing steroid treatment is also excluded from this case-control study.

The age difference of cases and controls was calculated by Welch t tests, and the exact test was used to determine whether the SNPs departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The association between the minor allele and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH was evaluated by Pearson x 2 test. To assess the association between each genotype and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH, 5 models were used, including the codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and log-additive model. Finally, the SHEsis software platform [22] and Haploview software package (version 4.2) (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) were used to analyze the patterns of LD, haplotype construction, and the genetic association at polymorphic loci. [23] Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) could show whether the frequencies between cases and controls had a significant difference. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was adjusted for age. In order to eliminate the probability of falsepositive results, Bonferroni multiple adjustment was applied to the level of significance, which was set at P < 0.0017 (0.05/30).",

[3,29] Patients present with pain and limited hip-joint movement, caused by bone trabecula breakage and collapse of the subchondral bone, or with abnormal lipid metabolism and intravascular coagulation, which result in necrosis of the femoral head. [30,31] Some studies report that normal repair mechanisms might be disrupted after bone death, and the repair process probably takes place in the form of bone remodeling coupled with bone resorption and bone formation. [32] Generally, cellular responses in the physiologic cycle of bone remodeling involve a series of highly regulated steps, containing \"resting,\" \"activation,\" \"resorption,\" \"reversal,\" and \"formation\" phases. [33] Both osteoblasts and osteoclasts are the primary functional cells involved in the process of bone remodeling. Osteoclasts attach to the mineralized bone surface and initiate bone resorption by secreting hydrogen ions and by digesting bone collagen. Afterward, osteoblasts migrate to the bone resorption site and secrete bone matrix, which then mineralizes and forms new bone. The balance of the bone remodeling process plays a key role in maintaining normal bone mass.",

In fact, it has been demonstrated that osteoblasts have the ability to secrete MMPs. [34,35] MMPs are maintained at a normal level under the regulation of a variety of factors. During inflammation, MMPs regulate the differentiation of osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts to complete the repair of the necrotic bone. Moreover, it has been suggested that MMP2, which is encoded by the MMP2 gene located in 16q12.2, contributes to bone remodeling. [36] According to Keiichi Inoue, it plays a crucial role in forming and maintaining the osteocyte canalicular network, whose formation is a determining factor of bone remodeling and mineralization. [37,38] A report suggested that the abnormal expression of MMP2 causes osteolysis. [39] The upregulation of MMP2 induces the MMP/TIMP pathway, which in turn activates osteoclast bone resorption and accelerates osteoblast apoptosis and bone matrix degradation. The balance between bone resorption and bone formation is thus disrupted, and this imbalance could be the most important mechanism of collapse in ONFH. [32] Therefore, MMP2 is an important regulatory gene in alcohol-induced ONFH patients. We have not found any evidence for the role of heredity between MMP2 and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH in Chinese males. In this case-control study, carriers of the rs243849 \"T\" allele exhibited a 1.33-, 1.32-, and 1.36-fold, statistically significant increase in the susceptibility of alcohol-induced ONFH by the allele model, log-additive model without adjustments, and log-additive model adjusted for age, respectively. The patients who had the genotypes \"CC\" of rs243832 and \"CC\" of rs7201 had a decreased susceptibility of alcohol-induced ONFH. After Bonferroni multiple adjustment was applied, no significant association was found. However, the rs243849 risk allele \"T\" and rs243847 wild type allele \"T\" constituted the haplotype \"TT\", which, compared to the wild type \"CT\", increased the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH. Because Bonferroni correction is the most conservative approach, the variability of MMP2 may be a risk factor in the Chinese males.",

            "text": "In summary, we identified 5 SNPs of the MMP2 gene and found that the variability of MMP2 could be a biomarker for the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH. It is important to note that there were several limitations in our case-control study, such as limited sample size and lack of corresponding clinical information. Thus, further research is needed to verify our results, especially due to the lack of previous research on this topic. It is possible that MMP2 polymorphisms are related to the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH, and these data provide a theoretical foundation for future studies of this correlation in the Chinese population or in other populations.
