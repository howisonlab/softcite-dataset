[Subjects] The subjects were 18 healthy males who were divided into two groups: a NJF group and a control group. The NJF group consisted of 10 subjects, and the control group consisted of 8 subjects. [Methods] Participants in the NJF group received NJF treatment. The baseball pitching velocity, the EMG-RT, the premotor time (PMT), and the motor time (MT) during shoulder internal rotation movement were measured before and after 8 weeks of exercise. [Results] There were no significant differences among the results of the control group. In the NJF group, there were significant differences in baseball pitching velocity, EMG-RT and MT after NJF treatment. [Conclusion] NJF intervention shortens not only EMG-RT but also MT, which implies that NJF is effective for motor processes. Since the baseball pitching velocity increased, NJF may be recommended for the improvement of the performance of baseball players.",

The PMT is defined as the interval between the stimulation signal and the onset of voluntary electromyographic (EMG) activity of a response agonist. The MT is defined as the interval between the onsets of voluntary EMG activity to the mechanical response 4) . The PMT reflects the movement position, the movement pattern, the movement programming, and the state of consciousness, the level of alertness, and the time of the central process. The MT chiefly reflects factors at the periphery level, including muscle contraction, series elasticity, and difficulties in loosening of connective tissue and the joint capsule 5) .",
