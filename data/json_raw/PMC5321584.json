MATERIALS AND METHODS. The experimental groups were designed by the number and type of magnetic attachment. Twenty samples were tested with Magden implants. Each attachment was composed of the magnet assembly in overdenture sample and the abutment keeper in a mandibular model. Dislodging forces were applied to the overdenture samples (50.0 mm/ min) in 3 directions. The loading was repeated 10 times in each direction. The values of dislodging force were analyzed statistically using SPSS at 95% level of confidence. RESULTS. The retentive force of group 2 was greater than that of group 1 in both types of attachment in every direction (P < .05). Oblique retentive force of flat type magnetic attachment was higher than that of cushion type attachment in both groups (P < .05). In group 1, oblique retentive force showed the highest and anterior-posterior retentive force showed the lowest value in both attachment types (P < .05). In group 2, both types of attachment showed the lowest retentive force with anteriorposterior direction of dislodging force (P <.05). CONCLUSION. Proper retentive properties for implant overdenture were obtained, regardless of the number and type of magnetic attachment. In both types of magnetic attachment, the greater retentive force was attained with more implants. Oblique retentive force of flat type magnetic attachment was greater than that of cushion type. Among all subgroups, anterior-posterior retentive force was the lowest among three different directions of dislodging force.",

            "text": "The retention and stability of complete denture can influence a patient's ability to function and are directly related to patient's confidence and comfort. 1 However, it is difficult to achieve optimal denture retention and stability with severely resorbed mandibular ridge. 2,3 Thus, the overdenture assisted by osseointegrated implant is an attractive treatment because of its relative simplicity, minimal invasiveness, and economic feasibility. For overdenture supported by both implants and oral mucosa, fewer implants are necessary compared to the prosthesis supported only by implants. Usually, overdenture consists of 2 or more implants placed on upper and lower arch. 1 An attachment device (male part) connected to the implant has a corresponding coupling unit (female part) fixed to the tissue surface of the complete denture. When the attachment components are correctly connected, the complete denture can be provided appropriate support, retention, and stability by both implant and mucosa. 4 Since the concept of overdenture fixation for the overdenture introduced in Switzerland in 1898, 5 different attachment systems have been used to retain mandibular overdenture. Bars with clips, studs, and magnets were reported as viable treatment options. For implant overdenture, Mensor 6 also reported that bar, stud, and magnetic attachments were the most common attachment systems. It has been shown that solitary attachments are less technique sensitive and easier to clean compared to bar attachments. 7 Due to their simple application, studs and magnets have gained a wide popularity in clinical practice. 8 Application of the magnet in dentistry has been attempted to enhance the stability of the denture by repulsive force of magnet on both side of complete denture since 1930. 9 Since then, several investigations have been performed to increase the retention of denture. Magnet was surgically implanted in the mandible of edentulous patients to get magnetic attraction. [10][11][12] Freedman 13 tried to use repulsive force between magnets placed in upper and lower complete dentures. It was rarely succeeded to obtain adequate force to aid denture retention, and exposure of the magnet in wound area was also reported.",

Several investigators reported clinically satisfying results by using implants and magnetic attachments in patients unsatisfied with the existing mandibular complete denture. The results were permanent retention and proper dispersion of occlusal force of the magnetic attachment compared to other attachment systems. [16][17][18] Also, magnetic attachment is easily dislodged by lateral force, which prevents the damage of implant. Clinical application of magnetic attachment has become easier as several types of magnetic attachment have been introduced. Flat type with thin disk form performed high retention force, and cushion type with 0.4 mm of gap between magnet assembly and resin cap showed shock-absorbing effect on implant fixture.",

It would be possible to provide a stable denture and increased loadbearing capacity to the edentulous patient. If osseous condition precludes a standard sized implant approach, such as of patients with inadequate interdental space, reduced interocclusal space, or narrow atrophic osseous contour, 19 mini implants may provide an alternative treatment. With mini implants, 6-year survival rate of 95.5% for single tooth restorations and stabilization of overdenture was reported. 21 Meanwhile, permanent magnets have been used to improve retention and stability of dentures for many years, 22 and magnetic attachments have become one of the most common attachments used for these purposes. 23 Many authors have described procedures regarding the use of magnets and a high degree of patient satisfaction has been reported. 24 The implant overdenture is a two-component system that consists of an implant keeper and a magnet built into the denture. When the denture is seated, the keeper becomes an induced magnet by contacting with the magnet in the denture. Due to the attractive force of this mag-net, the retention of overdenture is enhanced significantly.",

            "text": "As several types of magnetic attachment have been developed, clinicians have a chance to choose the most appropriate type of magnetic attachment suitable for various clinical situations. Open-field and closed-field magnetic systems have been used to retain dentures for many years. Although the open-field system is the first of the magnets used for the retention of the overdentures, 23,31 many commercial systems now consist of the closed-field type. All magnetic assemblies investigated in this study were closedfield systems, so the retention reduced rapidly with increased separation. 16 Comparing flat type magnet with cushion type, flat type magnet is more retentive than other types, and cushion type has shock-absorbing effects and permits vertical movement of dentures. Although it was not discussed in this study because of its incompatibility with mini-implant, dome type of magnet was reported to permit lateral movement of dentures. 5 In this study, 2 types, flat and cushion type of magnetic attachment, were investigated to compare the retention and stability of the implant overdenture by the number and the type of magnetic attachment and the direction of applied force. Cushion type of magnetic attachment was found to be less retentive in oblique direction of dislodging force compared to flat type. Similar result was observed in the study of Seo. 5 Soe stated that it would be the result of a bigger dimension of cushion type magnetic attachment. As cushion type magnetic assemblies contain resin cap, the bigger dimension of magnetic attachment could easily cause dislocation of the magnetic attachment when excessive selfcuring resin is applied and relief of denture is insufficient. The difference of net dislodging force direction applied on the magnetic attachment between flat type and cushion type attachment could also influence the results. Attractive force of magnet is generally stronger to vertical direction of dislodging force than to lateral direction. In this study, the dislodging force is transmitted via resin cap, and therefore dislodging force of oblique direction has more lateral than vertical component of force to magnetic attachment in cushion type attachment. The dislodging force of cushion type attachment was more lateral than that of flat type attachment. This is the reason for lower retentive force of cushion type attachment to oblique dislodging force than that of flat type attachment. Cushion type attachment can be appropriate treatment option for the abutment, which is vulnerable to lateral force.",

The lowest retentive force was observed when anterior-posterior dislodging force was applied on cushion type of magnetic attachment (P < .05). This result can be misunderstood that magnetic attachment is much retentive to lateral movement of denture than to vertical movement, but oblique or anterior-posterior dislodging force did not reproduce the lateral movement of denture in clinical situation. These directions of dislodging force are rather similar with movement of denture when patients chew sticky food or masticate food unilaterally.

            "text": "This in vitro study tested the influence of the type and the number of magnetic attachment of the retention of mandibular mini implant overdenture. Measurements of retentive force were performed by 3 different directions of dislodging force. Experimental groups were classified by the numbers of implant, 2 or 4, and each groups were divided into 2 subgroup by the types of magnetic attachment, flat or cushion type. With five overdenture samples of each subgroup, a total of 20 samples were fabricated. Within the parameters of this study design, following conclusions may be made. First, In every subgroup of experimental group, magnetic attachment has proper retentive properties for implant overdenture. Second, the more implant placed, the greater retentive force achieved regardless of the type of magnetic attachment. Third, when oblique direction of dislodging force is applied, flat type of magnetic attachment is more retentive than cushion type of magnetic attachment. Finally, regardless of the type and number of implants, anterior-posterior retentive force is the lowest among 3 different directions of dislodging force. According to these conclusions, the mini implant overdenture with magnetic attachment can be the treatment of choice, when patient is with extremely resorbed mandibular edentulous ridge. With mini implant overdenture, esthetic and functional rehabilitation are expected to be achieved. With appropriate circumstances of patients, better retention and stability of overdenture could be expected to implant overdenture with 4 implants.",
