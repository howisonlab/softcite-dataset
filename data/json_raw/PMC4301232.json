Methods: In this prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial in minimally invasive surgery research center, 51 women with pelvic endometriosis and endometriotic pain (dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain) score of 5 or more (for at least one of these endometriotic pain), after laparoscopic diagnosis and conservative laparoscopic surgery were treated with either Letrozole plus OCP (n=25) or only OCP (n=26) for 4 months continuously. Results: Using VAS test, the score of dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain 4 months after the laparoscopic surgery declined significantly in both groups but the difference between results of the two groups was not significant. Conclusion: Both treatment modalities showed comparable effectiveness in the treatment of pains related to endometriosis and in comparison with OCP, Letrozole did not affect the outcome.",

The most common manifestations of endometriosis are dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and infertility that can have important effects on the quality of life (1,2). Endometriosis is an estrogen dependent disease (3,4) and estradiol supports growth and inflammation process in endometriotic lesions (2,5). Almost all treatments for endometriosis (GNRH agonists, progestins, danazol, OCP) have an effect on endometriosis by decreasing ovarian estrogen levels or antagonize estrogen.",

Aromatization is the last step in estradiol biosynthesis (3). Aromatase mediates the conversion of androstendione and testosterone to estrogens. Perhaps inhibition of aromatase enzyme and decreasing the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen could have a therapeutic effect as inhibition of endometriotic foci. Letrozole is a drug that can inhibit aromatase enzyme and in some studies on animal models (rats, mice and baboons) it has led to the reduction in the size of endometriotic implants (7)(8)(9)(10). Letrozole is a drug that inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the cytochrome P 450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues. Elevated levels of aromatase have been found in endometriotic lesions (11). Therefore, aromatase inhibitors maybe effective in treating endometriosis related pelvic pain.",

As Letrozole can activate ovulation and is also a teratogen (12), during its use the patient must take contraception. We prescribed Letrozole in combination with OCP in one group and in the control group we prescribed OCP only. Our sample was composed of the patients with at least one kind of endometriotic pain (dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain) who were diagnosed as endometriotic by laparoscopy. Laparoscopy was performed under general anesthesia using the triple puncture technique. On laparoscopy, the surgeon tried to excise or ablate all the endometriotic implants and adhesiolysis was also performed. The day before laparoscopy, a data collection form was filled by a physician. The severity of dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain was estimated by Visual Analogue Scale test (VAS test). Scale 0 was no pain and 10 was the most severe pain ever experienced. Those patients who had the score of 5 or more before the operation for one of their painful symptoms (dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain) were included in our study. After operation, the severity of endometriosis was written in the data collection form as revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification (ASRM) scores for endometriosis (1,13).",

On laparoscopy, there was no histologic evidence of endometriosis and pelvic pain score decreased significantly in response to treatment (17). In a study by Amesterdam et al., Anastrozole and OCP continuously for 6 months made reduction of pain in 93% of cases (23). In a study by Seal et al., 5 patients with ovarian endometrioma used letrozole, 2.5mg per day plus OCP for 6 months and they found disappearance of ovarian endometrioma and reduction of pain scores (24).",

We prescribed Letrozole in combination with OCP and the pain reduced significantly, but it is not known that the reduction in pain severity is due to OCP as a standard regimen for endometriosis or due to Letrozole itself or synergistic effect of the two. Therefore, we suggest another study to be conducted using larger sample sizes on single sexually inactive women to know the isolated effect of Lerozole on pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea secondary to endometriosis.",
