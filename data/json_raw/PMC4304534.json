            "text": "Introduction: Cognitive training (CT) has been reported to improve cognition in older adults. Its combination with protective factors such as physical activity (CPT) has rarely been studied, but it has been suggested that CPT might show stronger effects than pure CT. Materials and methods: Healthy older adults (aged 50-85 years) were trained with CPT (n=15) or CT (n=15). Interventions were conducted in 90-minute sessions twice weekly for 6.5 weeks. Cognitive functions were assessed before and immediately after the interventions, and at 1-year follow-up. Results: The main finding was an interaction effect on attention, with comparable gains from CPT and CT from pre-to post-test, but stronger effects of CPT to follow-up (P=0.02). Significant effects were found in subjects in terms of cognitive state (P=0.02), letter verbal fluency (P=0.00), and immediate (P=0.00) and delayed (P=0.01) verbal memory. Post hoc analyses indicated that these latter domains were affected differentially by CPT and CT. No significant between-subject effects were found. Conclusion: Our results suggest that CPT might lead to stronger long-term effects on attention. However, as the difference between CT and CPT was only evident at follow-up, these effects cannot be interpreted as a direct consequence of CPT; they may have been related to sustained physical activity after the training. Other domains were improved by both interventions, but no typical pattern could be identified. Possible underlying mechanisms are discussed, and directions for future research are suggested.",

            "text": "Increasing evidence suggests that even the aging brain is still amenable to neuronal and cognitive plasticity. For example, there is strong evidence that cognitive training (CT) can lead to improvement of cognitive functions in healthy older adults; eg, in immediate and delayed memory, speed of processing, executive functions, fluid intelligence, visual reasoning, visuospatial construction, attention, subjective cognitive performance, and neuropsychological status. [1][2][3][4][5] However, probably due to different types of training and study designs (eg, comparison to an active or passive control group), different effects have been reported. As a result, establishing any specification of the effects of CT programs remains difficult. 1,2 Transfer effects into nontrained domains cannot yet be clearly supported; therefore, recent studies suggest that multidomain CT seems more promising than interventions focused on only one domain for inducing lasting improvement of different cognitive functions in healthy older adults. 3,5,6 In addition, many studies suggest a positive effect of physical activity and structured exercise on cognitive functions, with the most consistent findings being reported Based on the current literature, the aim of this study was to examine whether the cognitive effects of CPT are superior to that of CT in healthy older adults, and to address the important criticisms raised above. For this purpose, healthy older adults were trained in a standardized group setting with CPT targeting multiple cognitive domains (memory, attention, executive functions) and multiple physical fitness components (strength, balance/coordination, flexibility, endurance) or pure multidomain CT. Training duration, frequency, and intensity were made comparable between the two interventions. Effects on various cognitive domains, assessed with an elaborate neuropsychological test battery, were compared between the groups directly after training and after 1 year. Neither a nonactive waiting-list control group nor a control group with intervention for which no cognitive effects could be expected was included, intentionally, as (i) the benefits of pure CT have been demonstrated extensively before, and (ii) the focus of this study is on the additional benefits of CPT. Derived from the current state of research, we hypothesized that, due to the consistent effects of physical activity mainly on executive functions, CPT might lead to stronger effects on executive functions when compared to pure CT.",

CT participants who matched those in the CPT group in age, education, and sex were selected from this database for statistical analysis controlling for differences between the two intervention groups. Matching for comparable age had first priority, because age is the most likely factor to influence cognitive functions. Comparable group sizes were ensured for the statistical analyses with this design, although the trial was controlled and the trainings were conducted in comparable, standardized settings, randomization was not possible, and only the dropout rate of the CPT can be reported. However, the matched participants selected for the CT were compared with the unselected participants to ensure that no other differences between groups were introduced by the matching.",

Referring to Ainsworth et al 1 MET corresponds to the resting metabolic rate obtained during quiet sitting. 29 Different physical activities can be rated by multiplying the amount of time spent on the respective activity by an activity-typical factor in the range between 0.9 for sleeping and 18 for running. 29 The total score and the information from moderate and vigorous activities were used to build categories indicating whether participants were highly active, moderately active, or mildly active (for exact criteria see Scoring Protocol under http://www.ipaq.ki.se/ scoring.pdf).

In other words, at first glimpse CPT seems to be more successful than pure CT; detailed analysis, however, shows that the difference in the attention effects occurred mainly within the time after the training until follow-up. In addition, we found significant within-subject effects of Time for overall cognitive state, executive functions operationalized by a letter verbal fluency task, and immediate and delayed verbal memory. Post hoc analyses indicated that these latter domains were affected differentially by the two interventions (see Table 4). However, we did not find significant between-subject effects of Group, indicating that the training effects in several cognitive domains were generally comparable between groups. Therefore, our hypothesis that CPT is superior to pure CT in improving executive functions is not clearly supported.",

It is important to note that attention is a crucial precondition for most cognitive functions such as memory, information processing, planning, problem solving, speech, or orientation, which in turn are necessary for an independent and autonomous life. 39 It is well known that attention is one cognitive function which is very aging sensitive, meaning that its decline is part of the normal process of cognitive aging. 40 Therefore, the superiority of CPT in this domain compared to pure CT within the follow-up period is highly relevant for prevention of cognitive aging. When considering studies investigating the cognitive effects of physical activity, it is striking that effects have most consistently been reported not in attention, but in the domain of executive functions. 7,8 At first sight, this seems controversial. However, when looking at details of relevant studies, improvements found have commonly been measured with tests that have vast similarity to the test that we used to assess attention. In more detail, these studies used inhibition tasks such as the Flanker task or the Stroop test. 10,13,41 Consistently, the reported effects of physical activity on executive functions seem to be selective for inhibition in older adults, but have been referred to as affecting executive functions. 42 The inhibition tasks used in those studies and the divided attention task used in our study both apply distractors which have to be ignored. Due to the similarity of the tasks, we can assume that the main result of this study is in line with those previous findings and that the difference lies primarily in the denomination of the cognitive domain (executive functions and attention, in this case both referring to similar cognitive processes).",

            "text": "However, as a possible reason for the stronger effects of CPT, it has been assumed that physical activity might lead to acute improvement of brain metabolism and plasticity; the mentally demanding tasks of the CT might then result in stronger improvement by making use of the enhanced brain metabolism and guiding the plasticity processes. 15,16 Looking closer at the improvements in attention shown in both groups of this study, our results do not entirely support this assumption: As can be seen in Figure 1, both groups seemed to show nearly comparable gains from pre-to post-test (CPT: mean diff=1.46 vs pure CT: mean diff=1.67), and the significant interaction effect seems to be mainly driven by the stronger improvement in the year after the training (CPT: mean diff=2.73 vs pure CT: mean diff=0.40). The short-term gains from pre-to post-test in attention after both interventions can be interpreted as a relevant achievement of both kinds of training. However, with regard to the self-reported physical activity and the changes in the different MET scores, as well as the categories concerning physical activity over the three assessments, we found that the pretest/post-test increase of physical activity induced by the CPT could be stabilized at follow-up on a group level. First, at baseline 2 participants were categorized as mildly active, whereas at post-test and at 1-year follow-up all participants were at least moderately active or even highly active. Second, even if the improvements in the MET scores from pre-to post-test in vigorous activity and the total MET score could not be stabilized to follow-up, at least for moderate activity, the raw scores indicate that even at follow-up moderate activities were more often performed by the participants than at baseline. As the main focus of the physical part of the CPT intervention lay on moderate activities, this result supports the efficacy of the CPT intervention to motivate participants to remain physically active on a moderate level even after the training. Thus, we assume that due to the stabilization of moderate physical activity, the effect on attention primarily achieved through both types of intervention (probably by different mechanisms) could be maintained and even be strengthened in the combined group. In the pure CT group, attention was trained and improved to post-test as well, but, probably because of the lack of training and physical activity afterwards, these gains could not be maintained to follow-up. However, these results imply that it was not the CPT training itself but the activity after the training that was important for the interaction effect. Therefore, we conclude that our data do not support the notion that CPT in itself is superior in improving executive functions or attention from pre-to post-test; however, the data do show that it could be useful to improve motivational variables which support participants in maintaining healthy lifestyle activities such as physical activity beyond the training period. The lack of significant between-subject effects of Group for attention strengthens the conclusion that we cannot support our superiority hypothesis for CPT. However, these assumptions are highly speculative and should be proven in future studies. Therefore, individual differences in motivation should be assessed; eg, with personality-factor questionnaires such as the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Five-Factor Inventory. 43 Furthermore, as our results show that the differences in the effects on attention were not apparent until the follow-up, this reinforces the need for follow-up assessments when investigating effects of cognitive interventions in healthy older adults. Recently, a randomized controlled CPT trial in healthy older adults with a 3-month follow-up was also unable to verify any superiority of CPT versus CT. 21 Other recent randomized controlled trials on CPT have similarly failed to support the superiority hypothesis. 19,20,22 In good accordance with the study by Linde and Alfermann, both groups in our study showed improvements in attention from pre-to post-test. 21 However, contrary to the follow-up results of the other study, which was unable to find any significant long-term effects on attention of either CT or CPT, the difference between the groups became most apparent in the follow-up period. It may be that the lack of a multicomponent physical activity training led to the lack of significant longterm effects in that study; the follow-up period of 3 months may also have been too short compared to 1 year to detect superior effects of CPT. However, Oswald et al found comparable long-term improvement of attention after both CT and CPT. 16 Unfortunately, the intervention groups in that study were contrasted to a nonactive control group, while the direct contrast (CPT vs CT) was not analyzed. Therefore, our results are only partially comparable. Other studies that found no improvement of attention in either intervention group, 18 or after pure CT but not CPT, 19,20 did not assess long-term effects. Again, the lack of follow-ups might explain the differential effects of the interventions on attention in these studies. Another explanation for controversial findings concerning the domain of attention might be the lack of a multicomponent physical training in the CPT.",

Our study design was chosen because it has already been demonstrated that both CT and CPT are effective in improving cognitive functions in healthy older adults. 3,5,[16][17][18] It is likely that differences between these effects would have been too small to result in further significant interaction effects in the overall analysis. Furthermore, the small sample size of this study might have led to an underestimation of interaction effects. Some variables (overall cognitive state, immediate and delayed verbal memory) also had to be estimated with nonparametric analysis, such that no interaction effects could be calculated. However, as interaction effects include both the effects of Time and of Training, the nonparametric analyses should have shown differences in both these categories. We found only Time effects, which indicates that there were changes over the three assessments; the lack of group differences also supports the assumption, however, that these changes were comparable between the groups.",

The short-term result supports the findings of another study that found no differences between the groups in verbal memory gains. 19 However, at follow-up, we found a trend for difference in immediate verbal memory between groups (DemTect, immediate recall: H [1]=3.64, P=0.06, \u03d5=0.67). This might have been because of the fact that in pure CT, the participants had 20 minutes more to train memory tasks, to learn about memory functions, and to practice the mnemonic strategies more intensively (see Table 1). Therefore, one might speculate that in our investigation the newly learned mnemonic strategies stood an increased chance of being retained in the cognitive health behavior repertoire of the CT participants after the training. Unfortunately, the use of strategies until follow-up was not recorded, which leaves this assumption speculative. A question also remains as to why no significant short-or long-term improvement after CT was observed in the delayed verbal memory recall condition compared to after CPT. It has to be emphasized that the CT group showed a nonsignificant improvement directly after training (DemTect, delayed recall: z=-1. 35, P=0.10, \u03d5=0.35) that was maintained until follow-up (z=-0.98, P=0. 19, \u03d5=0.25). A lack of power due to the small sample size may explain the nonsignificant improvement after CT. Contrary to our findings, Shatil reported an improvement in long-term memory only after CT. 20 However, others have found significant improvement after CPT in other memory tasks; eg, word-association tasks or logical memory immediate recall tasks.

Furthermore, the main result is in line with existing evidence. However, the baseline comparison of education came close to significance, with P=0.08. We matched participants for age and education, but with the focus on age as this seems to be the most important variable influencing cognitive functions. Due to different education ranges in CT and CPT (see Table 2), we recalculated the ANOVAs with education as a covariate. The results did not differ from the reported findings (the interaction effect for the BTA was still significant), and we therefore abandoned this option to report the parametric analyses with education as a covariate and the nonparametric without education as a covariate.

This may have led to an underestimation of interaction effects, as power analyses indicated a power of only 20% to detect small interaction effects. However, the detection rate of moderate to strong interaction effects was 85% to 99%. Also, due to the study design the achieved power could only be estimated with a post hoc analysis, rather than an a priori power calculation. In future studies, a priori power calculations should be used to plan appropriate sample sizes. Additionally, as the assumptions of normal distribution and homogeneity of variances were violated for some variables, it was necessary to use nonparametric analysis in these cases, so that no interaction effects could be tested for the domains of overall cognitive state and verbal memory. The post hoc analyses of the significant within-subjects effects of Time enabled a comparison of the improved domains within the two intervention groups, but no direct comparison could be made, and therefore no conclusion can be drawn about the relative strengths of the effects of the interventions for these domains. Therefore, future studies with larger sample sizes and complete randomization should aim to confirm the found differential improvement patterns of CPT vs pure CT with appropriate statistical analyses. Although no significant difference was observed between the groups at baseline, the CPT group started with slightly worse baseline scores in nearly all cognitive tests compared to pure CT. Even if none of the differences at baseline was significant, one could argue that participants with lower initial scores had a greater chance to improve in a cognitive domain. Post hoc analyses showed that the improvement was negatively correlated with baseline performance in the corresponding domain (all P#0.05). In other words, participants with a lower baseline score showed a stronger improvement in these domains. It has already been discussed that the lower range of a high-functioning sample can be improved more. 44 But on the contrary, other studies have reported that higher baseline scores were found to be predictive for maintaining benefits of memory training. 45 This merits further investigation, and predictor analysis will be useful here. Also, the CPT and the pure CT were considered as comparable concerning training duration, frequency, and intensity, though the combined group received one additional session of 90 minutes on the topic Physical activity and nutrition. However, in our view, the difference between CPT and CT in this study is minimal compared to other investigations in which (i) training sessions were doubled by implementing both cognitive and physical training in the combined group [20][21][22] or (ii) additional training was compensated through additional social contact in the noncombined groups. 16,17 In future studies, the total amount of interventions should be equal across groups.",
