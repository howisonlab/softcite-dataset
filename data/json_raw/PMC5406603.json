            "text": "The multicellular spheroid model partly mimics tumor microenvironments in vivo and has been reported in plenty of studies regarding radiosensitivity. However, clear isolation of quiescent and proliferating cells in live conditions has been quite difficult owing to technical limitations; therefore, comprehensive characterization could not be done thus far. In this study, we succeeded in separately isolating different cell types using a fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci) and determining their radiosensitivities. Unexpectedly, proliferating cells were more radioresistant than quiescent cells due to the contact effect when spheroids were disaggregated immediately after irradiation. However, the radiosensitivity of quiescent cells was not influenced by mild hypoxia (hypoxiainducible factor-1a-positive but pimonidazole-negative), but their radioresistance became similar to that of proliferating cells due to potentially lethal damage repair when disaggregated 24 h after irradiation. The Fucci system further allowed long-term observation of cell kinetics inside of the spheroid following irradiation using real-time confocal fluorescence scanning. Repeated cycles of recruitment from the quiescent to the proliferating phase resulted in cell loss from the outside of the spheroid toward the inside, causing gradual shrinkage. Interestingly, the central region of the spheroid entered a dormant stage approximately 40 days after irradiation and survived for more than 2 months. Using the Fucci system, we were able to comprehensively characterize the radiosensitivity of spheroids for the first time, which highlights the importance of cell cycle kinetics after irradiation in determining the radiosensitivity under tumor microenvironments.",

            "text": "C ell cycle kinetics greatly influence radiosensitivity, as indicated by in vitro analysis. Terasima and Tolmach were the first to report fluctuations in radiosensitivity during the cell cycle; cells in late S phase were the most radioresistant, whereas those in M phase were the most radiosensitive. (1) It has also been well recognized that cells stopping cell cycle progression show potentially lethal damage repair (PLDR). (2) Potentially lethal damage repair has been the operationally observed phenomenon that the surviving fraction (as determined by a clonogenic assay) significantly increases when plateau phase cells with low growth activity are plated after a delay, as opposed to immediately after irradiation. (3) In addition to the aforementioned factors, when studying solid tumors, it is necessary to take into account features of the tumor microenvironment that are absent during in vitro conditions. For example, within tumors in vivo, hypoxic and quiescent cell fractions are generated because oxygen and nutrition are delivered by diffusion from tumor vessels, thereby varying their concentration throughout the tumor. (4) Considering that cells become radioresistant when oxygen tension is below 20-30 mmHg, with an ED 50 (effective dose: pO 2 required to achieve 50% of the radioresistance) =~3 mmHg, (4) such hypoxic cells in tumors have been thought to be a cause of cancer relapse after radiotherapy by in vitro studies. The multicellular spheroid model includes 3-D anchorageindependent growth conditions, quiescent and proliferating cell fractions, and hypoxia, thus partly mimicking in vivo conditions, albeit with no vasculature. (5)(6)(7) This model has been used to study radiosensitivity in tumor microenvironments, and indeed, radioresistance was shown by 3-D cell-cell contact (contact effect) (8) and the existence of a hypoxic cell fraction. (9) Concerning the latter, the existence of a very small fraction was contemplated due to the shape of cell survival curves detectable only at high doses. (9) Although coculture of fibroblasts with tumor cells was reported to increase the radioresistant hypoxic fraction, (10) sufficient radioresistance by hypoxia is unlikely to be detected in a simple spheroid model. Potentially lethal damage repair was also detected when irradiated spheroids were disaggregated and prepared for a clonogenic assay after a delay. (11) Structurally, mature spheroids are known to consist of the outer thin proliferating and inner hypoxic quiescent fraction, by demonstrating that only the outer fraction contains DNA synthesizing cells incorporating 3 H-thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine. (6) However, due to technical limitations, it has been quite difficult to separately isolate them in live conditions. Availability of such techniques should provide highly useful information regarding the effect of cell cycle kinetics on radiosensitivity.",

We previously reported that the radiationinduced Fucci fluorescence change perfectly reflects the radiation-induced G 2 arrest in HeLa-Fucci cells, (13,14) and such a G 2 arrest is prolonged in tumor microenvironments. (15,16) In this study, we newly established a human tongue carcinoma cell line expressing Fucci (SAS-Fucci cells) and forming spheroids. First, we characterized radiation-induced cell cycle kinetics of spheroids and separately isolated quiescent and proliferating cells. Next, we determined their radiosensitivities by a clonogenic assay, and compared them to the survivors obtained from long-term observation of the spheroid following irradiation when its structure was maintained.",

To establish SAS cells expressing the Fucci probes, the Fucci plasmids were virally transduced into SAS cells, and Fucci-expressing cells were isolated through two-step cell sorting (Fig. S1). Ultimately, a clone expressing high levels of fluorescence was isolated and designated as SAS-Fucci. Fucci function was assessed by time-lapse imaging: red fluorescence gradually shifted to green fluorescence, and then back to red fluorescence after mitosis (Fig. 1b). Two-dimensional flow cytometry analysis revealed the inverted U-phase (Fig. 1c) of exponentially growing cell populations. (12) After 10 Gy irradiation, the number of green cells gradually increased, reaching a peak approximately 16 h after irradiation, and then red cells appeared 24 h after irradiation. By 72 h after irradiation, most cells had returned to their original distribution, although a small fraction of green cells persisted (Fig. 1c, upper and middle panels). These kinetics reflected G 2 arrest kinetics, as shown by DNA content analysis (Fig. 1c, lower panels). Overall, the fluorescence kinetics were similar to that of HeLa-Fucci cells reported previously. (13,14) Thus, we confirmed that the Fucci system expressed in SAS cells was fully functional.",

The EdU staining overlapped with the outer layer, which mainly contained green cells. Confocal laser scanning images of the spheroid (Fig. S2) confirmed that the outer layer consisted mainly of green cells, whereas the interior consisted mainly of red cells. When using this method, deeper regions (>100 lm from the surface) appear dark due to the optical conditions of the confocal scanning microscope system used. Furthermore, we examined hypoxic conditions inside the spheroids by immunostaining for HIF-1a and pimonidazole. The inner region was positive for HIF-1a, but not for pimonidazole (Fig. 2b), indicating that the interior was mildly, but not severely, hypoxic. (18,19) Taken together, these results indicated that the outer rim, rich in green cells, represented the growing fraction, whereas the interior, rich in red cells, was a quiescent fraction under mild hypoxia.",

In addition, the time course of the ratio of green to red fluorescent areas in the same plane is shown in the absence (Fig. 3c) or presence (Fig. 3d) of irradiation. Essentially, in the absence of irradiation, the ratio did not change at any depth ( Fig. 3c). At a depth of 25 lm, corresponding to the growing fraction, a mixture of red and green cells was observed. After irradiation, the proportion of green cells gradually increased, reaching a peak approximately 24 h after irradiation; thereafter, it decreased and went back to the original distribution by 72 h, which was thought to reflect G 2 arrest kinetics. The time required to reach the peak was somewhat longer than for cells in monolayer cultures (Fig. 1c). At a depth of 50 lm, only a small part of the quiescent fraction was included in the plane, whereas at a depth of 100 lm, the quiescent fraction accounted for the majority of the plane. Considering that quiescent red cells remained red even after irradiation, it is reasonable that the peak height decreased as the depth increased, as shown in Figure 3(d).",

We next tried to sort cells by flow cytometry according to Fucci fluorescence under sterile conditions to isolate cells in the outer proliferating and inner quiescent regions. As a control, red and green cells isolated from each fraction I and II (Fig. 4a, upper panel) showed essentially the same radiosensitivity in monolayer cultures (Fig. 4a, lower panel). Two-dimensional FACS revealed that the red fraction consisted of cells with a wide range of red fluorescence intensities immediately after irradiation (Fig. 4b, upper panel), but primarily of cells with higher intensities 24 h after irradiation (Fig. 4c, upper panel). These results indicate that, during the 24 h after irradiation, cells with lower red fluorescence intensity in the growing fraction reached G 2 phase (green) and stopped there, whereas quiescent cells remained in G 0 phase (red) with higher intensity. The green fraction also shifted to the right, indicating that intensity increased due to the time spent in G 2 phase. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, the majority of cells in the growing fraction became green; consequently, sorting by red and green fluorescence was assumed to almost perfectly separate growing and quiescent fractions. However, immediately after irradiation, a non-negligible proportion of G 1 cells were present in the growing fraction. Given that all red cells were sorted, this fraction still contained part of the growing fraction. To overcome this issue, only cells with high intensity of red fluorescence, presumably corresponding to G 0 phase, were sorted to avoid contamination by the growing fraction.",

We finally tried to determine the radiosensitivities of isolated cells as described above by a clonogenic assay. Parameters fitted to the LQ model are summarized in Table S1. Surprisingly, the radiosensitivity of red cells sorted immediately after irradiation was the same as that of monolayer-cultured cells, and only green cells became markedly radioresistant (Fig. 4b, lower  panel), clearly showing that this was due to the so-called contact effect. (8) However, the surviving fractions of red cells sorted 24 h after irradiation increased and became comparable to that of green cells (Fig. 4c, lower panel). This phenomenon is known as PLDR. (3) One could argue that the radioresistance stems from cells that survived the massive cell death that occurred during the 24 h after irradiation. The percentage of cells in the dead fraction, as judged by DAPI-positivity, did not significantly increase in the 24 h after irradiation (Fig. S3). Therefore, we were able to exclude this possibility and attribute the radioresistance to PLDR.",

Next, we sought to determine whether such cells would show more radioresistance when irradiated under severe hypoxia. Because inner cells experienced mild hypoxia within the spheroid (Fig. 2b), we placed spheroids in a severely hypoxic condition (pO 2 < 0.1% = 0.78 mmHg) and irradiated them. Remarkable radioresistance was observed in both outer and inner cells, which had comparable surviving fractions (Fig. 4d, lower  panel). These results indicate that most of the inner cells were not in severely hypoxic conditions within spheroids, which do not significantly influence radiosensitivity.  activity is closely associated with clonogenic radiosensitivity. (20) Therefore, we examined the time course of DSB contents in outer and inner cells following irradiation (Fig. 5). Immunofluorescence staining for 53BP1 recognizes DSB sites and therefore a decrease in 53BP1 foci reflects DSB repair kinetics. (21) Many 53BP1 foci were observed in outer cells 0.5 h after irradiation, but significantly fewer foci in inner cells. Mild hypoxia was possibly sufficient to reduce the DSB number in inner cells. Until 72 h after irradiation, the foci number gradually decreased and inner cells always showed a significantly lower number of foci. These results indicate that simple DSB yield or DSB rejoining does not explain the difference in clonogenic radiosensitivity between quiescent and proliferating cells.",

Like Fig. 3b, radiation-induced G 2 arrest kinetics in the outer region was observed again. Judging from the spheroid size, the growing outer cells were first released from G 2 arrest followed by cell loss. Then, sequentially, from the outside towards the inside, red quiescent cells shifted to green growing cells followed by cell loss, and the spheroid gradually shrank. Forty-five days after irradiation, the shift stopped and red cells, presumably having constituted the core of the spheroid, entered a dormant state (Fig. 6b). The cells survived until 76 days after irradiation, after which they were transferred to monolayer culture conditions. Cells started to regrow and showed clonogenicity (data not shown).",

An alteration in chromatin packaging influencing DNA repair efficiency is a possible promising candidate. (8) The present study clearly shows that the contact effect occurs only in proliferating cells (Fig. 4a,b), consistent with the report that drugs stopping cell cycle progression attenuated the contact effect. (22) Mild hypoxia was not sufficient for inducing hypoxia-associated radioresistance in quiescent cells, but PLDR finally made them catch up with contact effect-induced radioresistance in proliferating cells when disaggregated 24 h after irradiation ( Fig. 4c). Notably, these phenomena were not simply correlated with DSB yield or DSB rejoining after irradiation (Fig. 5). Liu et al., (23) using the premature chromosome condensation method and FISH, reported that PLDR occurring in G 0 cells is due to enhanced fidelity of DSB repair through non-homologous end joining, but not due to enhanced rejoining. Taken together, a possible DSB repair mechanism might be postulated for the contact effect, as fidelity of DSB repair is somehow enhanced through alteration in chromatin packaging specifically occurring in growing cells within the spheroid.",

Presumably, cell loss of outer cells subsequently caused reoxygenation of inner quiescent cells, thereby activating a switch from the quiescent to the proliferating stage, (3) and in turn, cell death was induced. However, entering a dormant stage allowed cells to escape from the cycle, enabling them to survive. It is evident that this process was not reproduced in the clonogenic assay because the spheroid structure was broken after disaggregation and tumor environments were lost. However, the question as to why dormancy occurred in the spheroid after irradiation, remains to be addressed. This kind of dormancy is known to emerge in tumors after cancer therapy and is regarded as one of the mechanisms underlying the failure of cancer therapies. (24)(25)(26)(27) Cancer stem cells are thought to be involved in it, (24,25) and it is intriguing to speculate the existence of such cancer stem cells at the center of the spheroid. Further study is required to shed light on this issue.",
