Methods: The retrospective cohort study included patients who received CT-guided bone biopsy at a tertiary hospital over the 13 years. Results: Among 100 patients, 67 had pyogenic spondylitis and 33 had tuberculous spondylitis. Pathogens were isolated from bone specimens obtained by CT-guided biopsy in 42 cases, with diagnostic yields of 61% (20/33) for tuberculous spondylitis and 33% (22/67) for pyogenic spondylitis. For 36 culture-proven pyogenic cases, Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated organism. Patients with pyogenic spondylitis more frequently presented with fever accompanied by an increase in inflammatory markers than did those with tuberculosis. Among all patients who underwent surgery, the incidence of late surgery performed one month after diagnosis was higher in patients with tuberculous infection (56.3%) than in those with pyogenic disease (23.3%, p = 0.026). Conclusions: Results obtained by CT-guided bone biopsy contributed to prompt diagnoses of spinal infections, especially those caused by tuberculosis. Despite administration of anti-tuberculous agents, patients with tuberculous spondylitis showed an increased tendency to undergo late surgery.",

There is also an upward trend in spinal tuberculosis due to the growing number of immunocompromising conditions [2][3][4][5]. Even though the advanced diagnostic technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has improved the sensitivity and specificity of this disease entity, the diagnosis of spondylitis has been a challenge for physicians for many years [6].",

Detection of tuberculosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also used to aid the probable diagnosis when microbiologic evidence was not given [12]. The possible group contained cases that were clinically diagnosed and treated with conventional antibacterial and anti-tuberculous agents by attending physicians, based on clinical presentation and manifestation when test results from cultures, histopathology, and tuberculosis PCR failed to prove presumptive pathogen. Radiologic findings such as the patterns of destruction of vertebral end plates and signal-intensity changes of involved vertebrae, and presence of epidural, paravertebral, and dis-space abscess were also used to support a clinical diagnosis.",

Microbiological and pathologic data obtained by CT-guided bone biopsy contributed to the prompt diagnosis of spinal infection, especially in cases with tuberculosis, which showed a 60% diagnostic yield. The value of percutaneous biopsy had been analysed in previous studies with yields ranging from 40% to 70% [7,10,11,14]. The 60% yield of CT-guided bone biopsy in diagnosing tuberculous spondylitis achieved in this study is in accordance with results from previous studies. Even though prior stud-ies have already reported the high yield of percutaneous biopsy for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, these studies did not target subjects who underwent CT-guided bone biopsy. Most of the research issues associated with spinal tuberculosis have been confined to the diagnostic modality of MRI and clinical outcomes [2,6,15]. In such a situation lacking the evidence provided by specimens obtained under the guidance of CT, our study has significance in having evaluated a large number of patients and provided a comprehensive conclusion.",

            "text": "Patients in the culture-negative group presented with a lower CRP and a lower ESR compared with those of the culture-positive group, and previous antimicrobial ther-apy did not affect the negative results. In the previous study of evaluating the impact of prior antibiotic exposure on the results of culture in patients with infectious spondylitis, the presence of paravertebral abscess, elevated WBC, CRP levels were related to positive outcome, whereas longer duration of previous antibiotic expo- sure, 4 or more days was related to negative outcome [19]. According to the results of this study, although we have investigated duration of previous antibiotic exposure, we couldn't find the exact data for duration of antibiotic exposure. These findings might reflect the fact that this study was conducted in a tertiary-care hospital to which most of the patients were referred during antimicrobial therapy, and data concerning prescriptions given outside of the hospital may be incorrect. Alternatively, the negative culture result might be a reflection of a less extensive inflammatory process triggered by a low grade infection [20]. It is also possible that samples were collected at the site devoid of organisms, resulting in a false-negative result [21]. Given the concerns surrounding a possible false-negative result, a repeat biopsy might be considered when the first biopsy is negative. In past decades, radical resection of the tuberculosis-infected focus and bone grafting was suggested as a general approach for the treatment of spinal tuberculosis in patients with severe neurological deficits. With the advent of imaging modalities and effective treatment regimens, a non-operative approach was subsequently introduced for those with spinal tuberculosis and neurologic deficits [22]. However, delayed surgery for late onset complications involves the risk of neural deterioration and vertebral destruction leading to severe kyphosis [23]. In our study, 16 patients underwent delayed operation after the lack of improvement by medical approaches; of these, late surgery had been originally planned for four cases. Upon further investigation into these cases of late surgery for spinal tuberculosis, disease progression including kyphosis and spinal instability was observed in a total of nine cases despite administration of more effective antituberculous agents. These deteriorating outcomes in cases of delayed surgery raise concerns regarding trials that delay the initial surgical approach indicated at the time of diagnosis. According to a study that evaluated prognostic factors influencing the outcomes of patients with spinal tuberculosis, radical surgery was significantly related to a favourable outcome and a large number of involved vertebrae was related to the progression of kyphosis [2,24]. Considering these outcomes of surgical treatment in spinal tuberculosis, it is important to cautiously select cases that are predicted to deteriorate during medical treatment for early-radical operation, especially those involving more than two vertebrae and with expected kyphosis [2,24]. If it is not possible to undergo an early-radical approach in adversely predicted cases, it is mandatory to perform short-term follow-up for early recognition of impending neurologic deficits.",

Because clinical data regarding initial presentations and outcomes were collected retrospectively, initial clinical presentation and additional data that could be helpful to assess possible portals of entry in patients with spondylitis were not described precisely. A second limitation concerns the problems associated with a large single center study in a tertiary to which most of the patients were referred from other institutions. This might result in an inaccurate assessment of previous antimicrobial usage outside of this hospital and may lead to a large number of negative-cultural reports; thus, underestimating the exact diagnostic yield of bone biopsy in pyogenic spondylitis. Finally, there is the possibility of inaccurate diagnoses in cases of possible spondylitis. Among antituberculous agents, rifampin, and fluoroquinolone are known to be active against staphylococcal infection. Many cases that were treated as possible tuberculosis might have been culture-negative pyogenic spondylitis. To adjust for possible misdiagnoses between tuberculosis and bacterial etiologies, we classified cases into definite, probable, and possible groups. The clinical characteristics of tuberculous and pyogenic spondylitis infections showed consistent results even after adjusting for possible cases.",
