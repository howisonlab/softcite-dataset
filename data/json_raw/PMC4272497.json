So far effects of these measures on the number of cases and mortality rate of cervical carcinoma were modest. Only exception is organized testing based on cytological exam of the cervical smear-Pap test, which has proven to be highly effective in reducing the number of cases and mortality of cervical carcinoma in countries with this program. Goal of this research is analysis of correlation between abnormal cytological test results and pathohistological diagnosis of all patients in the analyzed period. Material and methods: Research is descriptive, analytical, comparative, and partly epidemiological. Results of cytological and pathohistological diagnostic in the period between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011 were used for analysis. All analyzed patients had colposcopy exam and Pap test, and patients with abnormal results of this test underwent cervical biopsy for pathohistological diagnostics. Results: We came to following results and conclusions: total number of L-SIL and H-SIL (PAPA III) results was 395 (6.20%) in comparison to total sample of 5894 (92.44%) patients. There is a statistically significant difference in relation to PHD result of cervical biopsy after L-SIL and H-SIL (PAPA II and IV), and highest statistical margin is in relation of CIN II changes to cytological findings, issued at Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology and other health institutions. We come to conclusion that the highest percentage of patients with L-SIL and H-SIL findings is in age group between 0-29 years old. Statistical analysis has shown a positive trend in number of younger patients with L-SIL and H-SIL (PAPA III and IV), with average age of patients in 2011 being 31.12\u00b19.12 years old."

Cytodiagnostics of the vaginal-cervical-endocervical (VCE) smear by volume is the largest in exfoliative cytology, since it covers both the healthy and sick women. The smears include epithelial and non epithelial cells (2,3). In the universal effort for combating cervical cancer are available several possible approaches, including measures of primary and secondary prevention. So far, most of the effects of these measures on the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer were modest. The only exception seems to represents organized screening based on the use of cytological examinations of the cervix (Pap test), which proved to be highly effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in countries where it is implemented. Reduction of mortality caused by cervical cancer in the United States and other developed countries is significant, and this is due to the successful early diagnosis. Squamous intraepithelial lesions are detected in adolescents, young adults and adults. The peak incidence is at the age of about 30 years. Similarly, invasive carcinoma occurs earlier, in the third decade of life with a peak frequency at about 40 years, or 10-15 years later (4).",

While the total number of women with CIN III (n=152) at the Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics was 90.1%, and women who were diagnosed at other clinics was 9.9%. This results show that there is a statistically significant difference compared to the PHD biopsy of the cervix after L-SIL and H-SIL (Pap III and IV) cytologic findings, and that the largest statistical difference is in case CIN III changes in relation to the cytological findings, issued on the Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics and other medical institutions."

We came to the following conclusions: The total number of L-SIL and H-SIL (Pap III) findings amounted to 395 (6.20%) compared to other cytological findings-5894 (92.44%). The frequency of H-SIL (Pap IV) was not statistically different in the observed period. The highest percentage of women who underwent cervical biopsy had CIN I findings (n=283). Histopathologic findings of CIN II and CIN III were the most common in 2010. There is a statistically significant difference compared to the PHD biopsy of the cervix after L-SIL and H-SIL (Pap III and IV) cytologic findings, and that the largest statistical difference in CIN III changes is in relation to the cytological findings, issued at the Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics and other health care institutions. The highest percentage of patients with L-SIL and H-SIL (Pap III and IV) findings was in the age group under 29 years. The percentage and frequency of L-SIL and H-SIL findings in women of older age groups linearly decreases and is lowest in the age group of 60-69 years."
