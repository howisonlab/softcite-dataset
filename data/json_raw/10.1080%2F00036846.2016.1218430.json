The data are drawn from Australian cities and was collected during a severe drought. Structural equation modelling is employed to operationalize constructs taken from the theory of planned behaviour and to answer important policy questions related to compliance. The modelled data support the view that attitudes, social norms and perceived behavioural control (PBC) have a positive and significant influence on intentions to comply. PBC has the strongest influence on intentions, suggesting policy directed at assisting households to meet regulatory criteria might be at least as effective as advertising expenditures aimed at shaping attitudes and norms. Importantly, intentions to comply are also shown to have a positive and significant influence on reported compliance behaviour.",

            "text": "Applied economists have long been interested in the relative importance of different influences on behaviour. This extends beyond simply understanding the rational consumer's choice and encompasses a range of domains including the motivations for altruism (e.g. Wintrobe 1981), job selection (Clark 1997), voting (e.g. Chari, Jones, and Marimon 1997;Barton, Castillo, and Petrie 2016), risk taking (e.g. Kanbur 1981) and compliance with authority (e.g. Becker 1968). Understanding the motivations for compliance is particularly important for governments since poorly targeted interventions run the risk of weakening the impact of state intervention and can simultaneously generate extraordinary costs. These risks are particularly high when governments are inclined to defer to intervention as a matter of course, without due consideration to the possibility of government failure, as is often the case when water has to be allocated in times of scarcity.",

            "text": "An extended and severe drought in southern Australia early in the 2000s resulted in most state governments mandating restrictions on how water could be used in urban areas (locally referred to as 'water restrictions'). These constraints included limits on which households could apply water outdoors (e.g. odd numbered houses one day and even numbers others), what could be watered outdoors (e.g. lawns versus gardens versus filling swimming pools), the types of devices that could be used to irrigate outdoors (e.g. sprinklers versus hand-held hoses) and the times at which watering could occur (e.g. days of the week and/or number of hours per day). Similar policy responses are currently being witnessed in California, despite protestations from economists that prices are generally more efficient mechanisms for dealing with scarcity than rationing based on behavioural constraints (see, e.g. Crase and O'Keefe 2009;Grafton et al. 2011;PPIC 2015). Setting aside the welfare losses that attend these types of restrictions, questions arise about why (and if) residents would comply with water restrictions imposed by the state.",

            "text": "There are several reasons why the Australian experience with water restrictions in the 2000s provides a useful context for considering these questions. First, the parallel with drought responses in other parts of the World offers useful contrasts, especially as similar restriction regimes are being encouraged in places like California (see, PPIC 2015). Second, despite the fact that the Australian drought eased in the late 2000s, legislation for water restrictions remain in place, with anecdotally strong support from the populace, regardless of estimated welfare losses (see, e.g. Cooper, Burton, and Crase 2011;Allen Consulting Group 2007;Harman, Lynch, and McEachern 2008;Edwards 2008). Third, this context offers the opportunity to investigate the effectiveness of compliance regimes empirically and to shed light on the relative importance of psychometric and other exogenous variables. In that regard, it is worth noting that the legislation governing water restrictions and compliance is not uniform across Australian jurisdictions. For example, the frequency and severity with which financial punishment was meted out for recalcitrant behaviour differed between states, with Sydney having a history of employing substantially more water patrol inspectors and fining residents more often than Melbourne (see Cooper, Rose, and Crase 2012). In contrast Melbourne residents were subjected to intense advertising campaigns aimed at shaping attitudes and norms about water conservation. This offers an opportunity to reflect on the relative strength of differing motivations to comply and matching this against the efficacy of alternative compliance regimes.",

Accordingly, this article also adds to the applications of TPB, which has increasingly been shown to be useful in understanding complex economic behaviours (e.g. Kautonen, van Gelderen, and Tornikoski 2013). The article uses data on compliance behaviour based on a sample from the two most populous states of Australia -New South Wales and Victoria. The data set was designed to provide representation across a number of dimensionsincluding regional and metropolitan cities, water-rich and water-poor communities, and differing compliance legislationbut the focus here is on behavioural constructs from TPB that should be relatively consistent across those dimensions. The data are scrutinized using structural equation modelling (SEM), a technique shown to be particularly useful where complex behavioural relationships are of interest (e.g. Kautonen, van Gelderen, and Tornikoski 2013;Powdthavee and Wooden 2015).",

TPB posits that individuals behave rationally to the extent that they systematically consider the consequences of their actions (Ajzen 1991). The approach is particularly useful for exploring behaviour when individuals require skills and resources in addition to the will to act (d 'Astous, Colbert, and Montpetit 2005;Eagly and Chaiken 1993). The model has been widely applied (e.g. Ajzen and Fishbein 1977;Bryan, Ruiz, and O'Neill 2003;Sheppard, Hartwick, and Warshaw 1988) and specifically employed to consider delinquent behaviour, like cheating and lying (Beck and Ajzen 1991), software piracy (Peace, Galletta, and Thong 2003), music piracy (d 'Astous, Colbert, and Montpetit 2005;Kwong and Lee 2002) and shoplifting (Tonglet 2001). Applications in the context of economics are also becoming more common (e.g. Kautonen, van Gelderen, and Tornikoski 2013;Karppinen 2005). The TPB is based on the presumption that three antecedents attend behavioural intentions: namely, the attitude towards the behaviour, social norms and perceived behavioural control (PBC) (Ajzen and Fishbein 1970).",

The positive relationship between social norms and compliance is well established in the literature (see, e.g. Sutinen and Kuperan 1999) and undoubtedly the intensive media campaigns used to rein in water use in some Australian cities in the 2000s sought to shift norms and even encourage community reporting of delinquent behaviour of individuals (see, e.g. Wells 2007;Worrall 2008). The ongoing influence of these campaigns, witnessed by an enduring focus on conservation regardless of available water supplies, can arguably be attributed to the successful alignment of descriptive and injunctive norms, as predicted by Cialdini, Reno and Kallgren (1990).",

SEM is usually deployed as a confirmatory technique, but can also be used for exploratory purposes (Schreiber et al. 2006). Basically, SEM allows for the testing of theoretical propositions about how constructs are related and the directionality of significant relationships (see, Ullman 2001).

The method is particularly valuable when one dependent variable becomes an independent variable in subsequent dependence relationships. This set of relationships, each with dependent and independent variables, is the basis of SEM (Hair et al. 2006). SEM techniques are characterized by two main elements. First, the technique provides estimation of multiple and interrelated dependence relationships. Second, SEM has the capacity to represent unobserved concepts in these relationships and account for measurement error in the estimation process (Hair et al. 2006). A rudimentary mathematical form of SEM is illustrated in equation (1).",

The power of the SEM approach is that a wide variety of model types can be represented within the same structure, depending on the definition of the observed variables and the structure of the relationships between them and the latents. Thus, the model can be presented as a measurement model, a measurement error model or even a regression model. SEM has a number of advantages over the more conventional regression and/or path analysis approaches (see, e.g. Schreiber et al. 2006;Teo 2010). Some of the more important benefits include the fact that SEM can (1) combine multiple observed measures of a latent construct (unobserved variables) and then model the causal relationships amongst these constructs rather than amongst single observed variables, which are simply proxies for the latent constructs; (2) use unique measurement errors associated with the measurement of each observed variable; (3) provide unequal weightings for the multiple indicators of a latent construct; (4) allow for correlations amongst the measurement errors (Loxton 2011;Pearl 2000).",

The null hypothesis is that the fitted covariance matrix (based on the paths between variables implied by the fitted model) and mean vector of the observed variables are equal to the matrix and vector of the sample. A rejection of the model implies that there are significant paths between variables that have not been represented in the model. Whilst this test retains its popularity, there are several substantial limitations in its application. First, as the test is essentially a statistical significance test, it is sensitive to sample size, which means that the model Chi-square statistic frequently rejects the model when large or small samples are used (Hooper, Coughlan, and Mullen 2008;Joreskog and Sorbom 1993). Second, the Chi-Square test assumes multivariate normality and significant deviations from normality could result in model rejections, even when the model is accurately specified (McIntosh 2006). The Bollen-Stine bootstrap (Bollen and Stine 1992) is one approach that can be used to adjust for lack of multivariate normality. Basically, it is a bootstrap modification of model Chi-square and is used to test model fit. However, it is also affected by large sample size, thus making other fit indices relevant. Given the restrictiveness of the model Chi-square, researchers have pursued alternate indices to evaluate model fit (refer to Appendix for a review of these).",

Second, respondents were generally keen to voice their opinion regarding ATTITUDE towards complying with water restrictions. For instance, one respondent stated that 'Water restrictions are necessary and they have become our \"way of life\"'. However, the attitudes towards compliance were not entirely positive with one participant claiming 'Water restrictions are \"unfair\" and \"ridiculous\"'. Similarly, participants articulated both positive and negative views in the context of PBC. For instance, a negative perspective of PBC was voiced by one participant as 'It is impossible for me to comply with water restrictions', although not all respondents held this view.",

This allowed further refinement of item wording and as a result some minor changes were made to the instrument itself, mainly to improve clarity.

In the standardized model, identification is achieved by imposing a condition that all variances are equal to 1. The figures adjacent to the rectangle box (e.g. 0.59 for attq1) represent the squared multiple correlations. For example, it is estimated that the predictors of attq1 explain 59% of its variance. Put differently, the error variance of attq1 is approximately 41% of the variance of attq1 itself.  To ensure stable results, a criterion of five subjects per parameter is optimal (Cunningham 2008). The model comprises 41 parameter estimates, which provides a parameter ratio of 12.3:1, such that the observation to parameter ratio is easily met. Assessment of normality on the distribution of the data revealed Mardia's coefficient to have a value of 185.97 (z-value = 77.79), which suggests a relatively significant departure from multivariate normality. Accordingly, the Bollen-Stine bootstrap p became the statistical test for the model, in preference to model Chi-square. Estimation revealed the Bollen-Stine bootstrap p-value to be significant (p = 0.005). This suggests there is a significant difference between the sample data variance/covariance matrix and the model implied variance/covariance matrix. This could be a result of the large sample size used in this study (see Section III) 4 and analysis of the Standardized Residual Covariance Matrix appears to be warranted (Joreskog and Sorbom 1993). In this case, if the estimated model is a 'good fit', most of the residual covariances should be less than two in absolute value. Approximately 97% of the residual covariances are less than two in absolute value, thus this does not indicate serious misfit between the model and the data.

These correlations could be interpreted as a limitation of the model, insomuch as this could mean there is a common preceding variable to ATTITUDES, SOCIAL NORMS and PBC. In this context, Ajzen (1991) suggests that an individual's beliefs about the behaviour are the underlying foundation of attitudes, subjective norms, and PBC. However, he also notes that the exact form of these relationships is uncertain. Of particular concern are studies displaying only modest correlations between belief-based measures of the TPB constructs relative to other, more global measure of these constructs (Ajzen 1991). Moreover, Fulton, Manfredo and Lipscomb (1996)'s cognitive hierarchy model of human behaviour, which depicts the hierarchical relationship between cognitive variables, implies that beliefs fall   into a higher hierarchical level than attitudes and norms. This model also suggests that beliefs are slower and harder to change, compared to attitudes and norms (Fulton, Manfredo, and Lipscomb 1996). Thus, from a practical perspective, understanding and appealing to one's attitudes, social norms, and PBC is potentially going to be more appealing from a policy perspective, especially if change is needed sooner rather than later. The correlations between four pairs of measurement errors are consistent with each of the correlations lying within a particular latent construct. For instance, measurement errors e19 and e18 for two of the manifest items for PBC are correlated and this empirical correlation becomes cogent conceptually when we compare the scales for these two manifest items: (1) 'My lifestyle does not allow me to stick with the water restrictions times' and (2) 'It is impossible for me to comply with water restrictions'.",

Generally, these data offer evidence that the TPB is a useful framework for examining compliance intentions in the context of water restrictions. Notwithstanding the subjective nature of some of these data, key findings suggest that the decision to comply with water restrictions is founded on attitude towards water restrictions, a perception that important others value compliance, and the perceived capabilities to actually undertake compliance behaviour. More specifically, attitudes, social norms and PBC have a positive and significant influence on intentions to comply and intentions to comply has a positive and significant influence on the compliance behaviour associated with water restrictions.",

Moreover, stringent enforcement of water restrictions when PBC is low is likely to generate additional enforcement costs for only small gains in compliance. Failure to consider the resources available to facilitate compliance could also raise equity concerns and thus have a significant impact on the social welfare of groups with least capacity to respond. Water restrictions, as presently conceived, result in highincome earners being better positioned than lower income households to increase their PBC. For example, high-income households are likely to have the resources to put in place technical devices to assist with compliance (e.g. installing timing devices to switch garden sprinklers on and off at the requisite times). In contrast, poorer households may be forced to give up hours of work (or sleep) to undertake outdoor irrigation. Thus, one approach to increasing compliance could involve increasing the PBC of poorer households, say by offering subsidies for timing devices. Clearly, this is an empirical issue against which the relative costs and benefits should be compared, but the data provided by this study provide a vehicle for undertaking such an analysis.",

However, promoting the universality of water 'saving' remains problematic (see e.g. Crase and O'Keefe 2009) and the gains in compliance versus the costs of such campaigns is an empirical question, and one which should be considered against the cost-effectiveness of alternatives.",

However, the extent to which this can cost-effectively act as a substitute for formal enforcement (i.e. water patrol inspectors) and the wider social consequences of vigilantism is unclear.

This article presents analysis of households' intentions to comply with government constraints on the use of urban water, or so-called water restrictions. The data are drawn from Australian cities and was collected during a severe drought. SEM is employed to operationalize constructs taken from the TPB and to answer important policy questions related to compliance. The modelled data support the view that attitudes, social norms and PBC have a positive and significant influence on intentions to comply. Perceived behavioural control has the strongest influence on intentions, suggesting policy directed at assisting households to meet regulatory criteria might be at least as effective as advertising expenditures aimed at shaping attitudes and norms. Importantly, intentions to comply are also shown to have a positive and significant influence on reported compliance behaviour.",

An acceptable ratio of this statistic ranges from less than 5.0 (Wheaton et al. 1977) to less than 2.0 (Tabachnick and Fidell 2007). Based on the guidelines presented by Hooper, Coughlan and Mullen (2008), Kline (2005) and Boomsma (2000), additional fit indices that are informative and appropriate to report include the following: (1) the root mean square error of approximation, where a value less than 0.07 (Steiger, 2007) indicates a good fit; (2) the standardized root mean square residual, where a value less than 0.05 is considered a wellfitting model (Diamantopoulos and Siguaw 2000) or the comparative fit index, where a value greater than or equal to 0.95 is presently recognized as indicative of good fit (Hooper, Coughlan, and Mullen 2008); (3) the parsimony fit indices, where it is possible to obtain parsimony fit with a value greater than 0.5; and (4) the goodness-of-fit statistic and the adjusted goodness-of-fit statistic, where values of 0.9 or greater indicate well-fitting models. In addition, reporting of the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion when comparing models has also been recognized as good practice (Barrett 2007).",
