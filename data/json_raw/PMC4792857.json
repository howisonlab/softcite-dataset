            "text": "Tibetan is a valuable Himalayan sheep breed classified as endangered. Knowledge of the level and distribution of genetic diversity in Tibetan sheep is important for designing conservation strategies for their sustainable survival and to preserve their evolutionary potential. Thus, for the first time, genetic variability in the Tibetan population was accessed with twenty five inter-simple sequence repeat markers. All the microsatellites were polymorphic and a total of 148 alleles were detected across these loci. The observed number of alleles across all the loci was more than the effective number of alleles and ranged from 3 (BM6506) to 11 (BM6526) with 5.920 \u00b1 0.387 mean number of alleles per locus. The average observed heterozygosity was less than the expected heterozygosity. The observed and expected heterozygosity values ranged from 0.150 (BM1314) to 0.9 (OarCP20) with an overall mean of 0.473 \u00b1 0.044 and from 0.329 (BM8125) to 0.885 (BM6526) with an overall mean 0.672 \u00b1 0.030, respectively. The lower heterozygosity pointed towards diminished genetic diversity in the population. Thirteen microsatellite loci exhibited significant (P b 0.05) departures from the Hardy-Weinberg proportions in the population. The estimate of heterozygote deficiency varied from \u22120.443 (OarCP20) to 0.668 (OarFCB128) with a mean positive value of 0.302 \u00b1 0.057. A normal 'L' shaped distribution of mode-shift test and nonsignificant heterozygote excess on the basis of different models suggested absence of recent bottleneck in the existing Tibetan population. In view of the declining population of Tibetan sheep (less than 250) in the breeding tract, need of the hour is immediate scientific management of the population so as to increase the population hand in hand with retaining the founder alleles to the maximum possible extent."

            "text": "Sheep biodiversity in India is characterized by high degree of endemism as variations in agro climatic conditions have led to the development of more than 40 breeds (Acharya, 1982). This vast ovine biodiversity is being eroded rapidly with more than 50% of sheep breeds currently under threat (Bhatia and Arora, 2005). Sheep provides employment and income to the socially and economically disadvantageous sections of the society being reared by the landless laborers and marginal farmers. Indigenous breeds must be considered as important reservoirs of non-exploited resources due to the presence of potentially unrecognized beneficial genetic variation. Moreover, autochthones breeds are the cultural properties due to their role in the agriculture tenures and in the social life of rural populations. Tibetan sheep is one such important breed of Indian North temperate Himalayan region. The sheep migrated to India with the Tibetan traders who used them as beasts of burden for transporting various merchandise besides wool (Government of Bengal, 1864). Independence of India in 1947 led to political and economic changes with concomitant cessation of their migration in the country.",

            "text": "Tibetan animals are of medium size, mostly white with black or brown face and brown and white spots on the body. The fleece is relatively fine and is among the best obtained from native ovine breeds of Indian subcontinent (Banerjee, 2009). The animals are unique being adapted to the harsh temperate climate and difficult terrains of Himalayas and survive even in the open housing system. Tibetan is regarded as one of the most rustic sheep breeds which thrives in conditions of extreme harshness and deprivation while providing meat and down for the people. They are the only source of livelihood in the area since agriculture is not suitable due to the geo-climatic characteristics. However, population of Tibetan sheep has been decreasing drastically in recent past (Banerjee, 2009) due to lack of regulated market, transport linkage, shrinkage of pasture land, increased inbreeding and occurrence of diseases. Population has gone down from 30,000 (Acharya, 1982) to less than 250 in Sikkim (Livestock Census, 2012;Kumar, 2015). Therefore, urgent specific management and conservation measures are required not only for the restoration of depleted natural population due to endangered status but also for its biological and economical relevance and ecological importance. Knowledge of genetic variability is very important for establishing any conservation and management program. The use of highly variable molecular genetic markers, such as microsatellites, is one of the most powerful means for studying genetic diversity because of their high degree of polymorphism, abundance, random distribution across the genome, co-dominant inheritance and neutrality with respect to selection (Barcaccia et al., 2013;Putman and Carbone, 2014). These are being used to estimate the diversity of autochthonous sheep breeds all over the world (Ghazyl et al., 2013;Ceccobelli et al., 2015) including India (Bhatia and Arora, 2005;Sharma et al., 2010). Unfortunately, no study has been undertaken so far to investigate the genetic characteristics of Tibetan sheep using molecular biology techniques. This is critical as urgent conservation efforts are required to conserve and utilize the Tibetan sheep genetic resource.",

These markers also adhere to the guidelines of International Society for Animal Genetics and FAO (http://dad.fao.org/en/refer/library/guidelin/marker.pdf). Detailed information on primers is presented in Table 1. Forward primer of each marker was 5\u2032 labeled with fluorescent dye, i.e. FAM, NED, PET and VIC. PCR amplification was performed in a reaction volume of 25 \u03bcl on i-cycler. Reaction mixture consisted of 50-100 ng of genomic DNA, 200 \u03bcM of each dNTP, 50 pM of each primer and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The amplification was carried out using a Touchdown program for all microsatellite loci, which consists of initial denaturation of 95\u00b0C for 1 min; 3 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 45 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min, 3 cycle of 95\u00b0C for 45 s and 57\u00b0C for 1 min; 3 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 45 s and 54\u00b0C for 1 min, 3 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 45 s and 51\u00b0C for 1 min and 20 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 45 s and 48\u00b0C for 1 min. The PCR amplification was confirmed by electrophoresing the products in 1.8% agarose gel followed by staining with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml). PCR products were multiplexed (Table 1) and genotyping was carried out on an automated ABI-3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA) using LIZ 500 as the internal size standard (Applied Biosystems, USA).

Tests of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Ewens-Watterson Neutrality were applied using POPGENE 1.31 version (Yeh et al., 1999). Bottleneck events in the population were tested by three methods. The first method consisted of three excess heterozygosity tests developed by Cornuet and Luikart (1996) sign-rank test. The probability distribution was established using 1000 simulations under three models-Infinite allele model (IAM), stepwise mutation model (SMM) and two-phase model of mutation (TPM). The second method was the graphical representation of the mode-shift indicator originally proposed by Luikart et al. (1998).

Of course, it is better to obtain as many individual data as possible to understand the current status of the population in terms of genetic diversity. However, in case of Tibetan sheep, only 215 animals are left (Kumar, 2015) which are reared in quite inaccessible region, the higher reaches of the North District of Sikkim state.

Expected number of alleles varied from 1.490 (BM8125) to 8.667 (BM6526) with the mean of 3.70 (Table 2). Thus selection of microsatellites with a range of polymorphism reduced the risk of overestimating genetic variability, which might occur with the selective use of highly polymorphic loci. A microsatellite preferably should have at least 4 alleles to be useful for the evaluation of genetic diversity as per the standard selection of microsatellites loci (Barker, 1994). However, 3 alleles per locus have also been used to evaluate genetic diversity (Li et al., 2010). Therefore all the 25 microsatellites were retained for further analysis. Allelic diversity (mean number of observed alleles per locus) higher than that observed in Tibetan sheep has been reported in some of the Indian sheep breeds (Arora et al., 2008;Kumarasamy et al., 2009;Radha et al., 2011;Sharma et al., 2010). However, MNA in Tibetan breed is higher than that observed in several other Indian sheep breeds viz. 4.94 in Madras Red sheep (Prema et al., 2008), 5.0 in Nilagiri (Girish et al., 2007), 5.04 in Muzaffarnagari (Arora and Bhatia, 2004), 5.3 in Kheri (Bhatia and Arora, 2008), 5.6 in Shahabadi (Pandey et al., 2009), 5.7 in Magra (Arora and Bhatia, 2006) and 5.88 in Vembur (Pramod et al., 2009).Thus it can be concluded that sufficient genetic variability exists in Tibetan sheep despite its decreasing population trend.",

An average value of 0.63 for the PIC once again indicated abundant genetic diversity in this population.

            "text": "Genetic variability is also measured as the amount of actual or potential heterozygosity, which is presented in Table 2. Expected heterozygosity was higher than the observed heterozygosity at all the loci. The observed and expected heterozygosity values ranged from 0.150 (BM1314) to 0.842 (CSSM31) and from 0.329 (BM8125) to 0.885 (BM6526) with an overall mean of 0.473 \u00b1 0.044 and 0.672 \u00b1 0.030, respectively. Genetic variation of similar magnitude (0.46-0.55) has also been reported in the endangered Namaqua Afrikaner sheep indigenous to South Africa (Qwabe et al., 2015). Whereas, higher heterozygosity has been reported in the two endangered Spanish breeds, Churra tensina (0.659) and Churra lebrijana (0.674) despite their small population size (Calvo et al., 2011). Most of the Indian sheep breeds with sufficient population exhibit higher heterozygosity (Ho) than the Tibetan sheep (Arora et al., 2011). Tibetan belongs to the sheep breeds of North temperate region of India. It has the least diversity estimates among the breeds of North temperate region also (Table 3). Similarly, much higher    Bosnia and Herzegovina (0.643-0.743, Salamon et al., 2014) and Turkish sheep breeds (0.66, Yilmaz and Sezenler, 2015). However, in assessing diversity estimates from different studies, it should be mentioned that the values are not directly comparable, as different microsatellite sets have been used by different workers. These values have only suggestive indication of diversity in the population. Observed heterozygosity was lower than the expected showing a departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and possibility of inbreeding. Significant deviation from HWE was observed in 13 out of 25 loci at P b 0.05 (Table 2). Departures from HWE of the similar magnitude were also reported in the endangered Spanish sheep breeds (Calvo et al., 2011), Italian (Ceccobelli et al., 2015), Turkish (Yilmaz and Sezenler, 2015) and in various Indian sheep breeds (Radha et al., 2011). Various factors can contribute towards excess of homozygotes. First, the locus is under selection. Second, 'null alleles' may be present which are leading to a false observation of excess homozygotes. Third, inbreeding may be common in the population. Fourth, the presence of population substructure may lead to Wahlunds' effect. (Nei, 1987;Peter et al., 2007). Distinguishing among these is generally difficult (Christiansen et al., 1974). The likelihood of each of these explanations must be assessed from additional data, such as demographic information, i.e. population distribution. Null alleles are most unlikely to be segregating at all the loci. Similarly possible Wahlunds' effects may not account significantly to the observed heterozygote deficit, as all the six flocks were at the same location. Ewens-Watterson Test for Neutrality revealed that all the microsatellite except OarHH47 and INRA63 (Table S1, observed F values lie outside of the upper and lower limits of 95% confidence region of the expected F values) were neutral. Since 92% loci were neutral, selection as a cause of the decrease in observed heterozygosity was ruled out. Thus the difference between the observed and expected heterozygosity can be attributed to the non-random mating among the individuals of the population. This was also reflected in the positive F IS value (0.302 \u00b1 0.057) which ranged from \u2212 0.443 to 0.687. Similar to our assumptions, the high F IS value (0.143) in the Spanish mouflon was considered as the major cause of the Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in that population (Calvo et al., 2011).",

However, Tibetan sheep (30.2%) exhibited the highest heterozygote deficiency among the Indian breeds, investigated so far. Authors agree that the major factor contributing towards the observed heterozygote deficiency in Tibetan sheep may be inbreeding due to extremely small population (b250) and ignorance of sheep owners about the scientific management. Under field condition, only natural mating is being practiced where the dominant male generally excludes subordinate males, and presumably sires most of the offspring. The general breeding practice in the region was to castrate most of the males. This lead to reduced effective population size/or mating between relatives and consequent genetic drift. The consanguinity produced by mating between relatives can be one of the principal causes for loss of heterozygotes, but has to be evaluated with caution, as inbreeding with significant deficit of heterozygote affect all or most of the loci in a similar way. Since eighty percent of loci depicted heterozygote deficit (Table 2), therefore we might consider consanguinity as the foremost cause of heterozygote deficiency. Salamon et al. (2014) have also concluded that breeding practice lead to the higher F IS value in the study involving 12 eastern Adriatic and western Dinaric native sheep breeds. Such a high level of inbreeding is risky as it could lead to genetic diseases and moreover can adversely affect animal fitness.",

            "text": "Bottleneck influences the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations. Population of Tibetan sheep has gone down drastically, which indicates the possibility of demographic bottleneck. In recently bottlenecked populations, the majority of loci will exhibit an excess of heterozygotes, exceeding the heterozygosity expected in a population at mutation drift equilibrium. To estimate the excess of such heterozygosity Sign, Standardized differences and Wilcoxon sign rank tests were utilized. The actual mutation model of evolution followed by our microsatellites is not known, thus all the three models (IAM, TPM and SMM) were selected for running the Bottleneck program. The values of average heterozygosity (He) and their probabilities (H N He) in the Sign test, under three models of microsatellite evolution were calculated and used to measure the expected number of loci with heterozygosity excess (Table 4). The expected numbers of loci with heterozygosity excess were 14.77, 14.94 and 14.62 in IAM, TPM and SMM with probabilities of 0.13211, 0.10276 and 0.39403 respectively, meaning that the null hypothesis was accepted when using the Sign test. These results indicate that, due to mutation-drift equilibrium, the Tibetan population has not undergone a recent genetic bottleneck. The standardized difference test provided the T2 statistics equal to 2.252, 0.269 and \u2212 2.667 for the IAM, TPM and SMM models, respectively. The probability values were less than 0.05 for IAM and SMM, thus hypothesis of mutation-drift equilibrium was accepted under TPM only. Using the Wilcoxon rank test (a non-parametric test) the probability values were 0.00441 (IAM), 0.28009 (TPM) and 0.91775 (SMM) under these three models, indicating that the null hypothesis is accepted under TPM and SMM and thus the population under study has not undergone a recent bottleneck. It has been considered that the most useful markers for bottleneck detection are those evolving under IAM, and they provide guidelines for selecting sample sizes of individuals and loci (Cornuet and Luikart, 1996;Di Rienzo et al., 1994;Spencer et al., 2000); meanwhile, the TPM is thought to more closely simulate microsatellite mutation (Estoup and Cornuet, 2000). Unlike the SMM, which predicts all mutations corresponding to the increment or decrement of a single base-pair repeat, the TPM predicts the occurrence of an occasional multiple base-pair repeat (Di Rienzo et al., 1994). The strict SMM is obviously the most conservative model for testing for a significant heterozygosity excess caused by bottlenecks, because in some conditions it can produce a heterozygosity deficiency, and due to the heterozygosity excess it is always lower than other mutation models. Thus we have considered results from all the three tests together and it is clear that serious demographic bottlenecks have most probably not occurred in this breed.",

This test discriminates many bottlenecked populations from stable populations Luikart and Cornuet, 1997). A graphical representation utilizing allelic class and proportion of alleles showed a normal 'L' shaped distribution (Fig. 2). The L shaped curve indicated the abundance of low frequency (b 0.10) alleles. This finding suggested the absence of any detectably large, recent genetic bottleneck (last 40-80 generations) in declining population, where the probability of low frequency allele's loss was very high. Taken together all the results indicate the absence of bottleneck events in the recent past history of this breed. Shrinkage of pasture, inbreeding, absence of scientific animal husbandry practices and management in very harsh climate have resulted in diminished profits for the Tibetan sheep herders. As a result, sheep rearing has failed to attract younger generations. Additionally, lack of proper policy is leading to rapid decline of Tibetan sheep population which are less than two hundred and fifty at present. Therefore, timely intervention is required to prevent extinction of this valuable breed of sheep, which helps in sustaining the livelihood of highlanders and the fragile agro-ecosystem. The information reported here is important for sheep breeders for the establishment of conservation strategies.",

Genetic parameters show a high value of inbreeding and therefore this breed should be monitored due to very low number of individuals that compose it. Still there is scope for reviving the breed because of high allele diversity which suggests that unique alleles present in this breed may not have been lost and the absence of bottleneck."
