            "text": "Purpose: To examine the effect of sodium copper chlorophyllin complex on the expression of biomarkers of photoaged dermal extracellular matrix indicative of skin repair. Patients and methods: Following a previously published 12-day clinical assessment model, skin biopsy samples from the forearms of four healthy females with signs of photoaged skin were obtained and samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for key biomarkers of aging skin after each subject was treated with a test material consisting of a gel containing a liposomal dispersion of sodium copper chlorophyllin complex 0.05%, a positive control of tretinoin cream 0.025%, and an untreated negative control. Results: There was a statistically significantly greater amount of fibrillin/amyloid P and epidermal mucins found for skin treated with the test material containing 0.05% sodium copper chlorophyllin complex and the reference control tretinoin 0.025% cream compared to the negative control (untreated site). Expression of procollagen 1 and dermal mucin also showed a greater presence in the samples treated with the test material and the reference control compared to the negative control, though the differences were not statistically significant. No adverse events were observed or reported by the subjects during the course of the study. Conclusion: The results of this human biopsy study suggest that both retinoids and sodium copper chlorophyllin complex have beneficial effects on biomarkers of photoaged skin. Products containing both sodium copper chlorophyllin complex and retinols may provide a dual approach to reversing age-related decreases in hyaluronic acid (HA) in the skin: inhibition of the breakdown of HA via sodium copper chlorophyllin complex by inhibition of hyaluronidase, and stimulation of HA synthases by retinol."

            "text": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is composed of two main classes of macromolecules: proteoglycans, which includes glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, primarily hyaluronic acid (HA; hyaluronan); and fibrous proteins, which include collagens, elastins, fibronectins, and laminins. HA is the predominant GAG of human skin, constituting more than 50% of the total HA in the body. 1 Because of its negative charge, HA is highly hydrating and serves as an extracellular reservoir that holds large amounts of cations and water, a mechanism for maintaining normal hydration of the skin. With advancing age, HA polymers become more tissue associated, presumably through HA-binding proteins such as fibrinogen, collagen, CD44, and hyaluronidase, which may underlie some of the changes in human skin that occur with aging. 2 The normal process of aging, as well as premature aging caused by sun damage, involve similar mechanisms that cause loss of moisture and changes in HA distribution. 3 Degradation of HA in the ECM by hyaluronidases results in a breakdown of structural integrity and an increase in tissue permeability, 4 thus inhibition of hyaluronidase activity prevents rapid degradation of HA and helps in maintaining structural integrity. As agents that maintain HA homeostasis, hyaluronidase inhibitors may serve as antiaging, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial agents. 5 Sodium copper chlorophyllin complex is a semisynthetic mixture of the water-soluble sodium salt of copper chlorophyllin and small molecule analogs derived from plant chlorophyll that possesses a unique combination of anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities. 6 Sodium copper chlorophyllin complex has been used topically for many years to aid in wound healing [7][8][9] but the ingredient has not been used until recently as an antiaging cosmeceutical in topical products. Sodium copper chlorophyllin complex has demonstrated inhibition of hyaluronidase activity in vitro, supporting the concept that topical application of sodium copper chlorophyllin complex may be useful in the regulation of HA in the skin, thereby acting to enhance the improvement in the appearance of facial skin. 10 Topical formulations containing a liposomal dispersion of sodium copper chlorophyllin complex have shown promise in the clinical treatment of various dermatologic conditions. A pilot study demonstrated that sodium copper chlorophyllin complex was clinically effective and well tolerated for the treatment of mild-to-moderate photodamage and solar lentigines when used for 8 weeks. 11 Another study demonstrated that topical sodium copper chlorophyllin complex was clinically effective and well tolerated for the treatment of mild-to-moderate acne and large, visible pores when used for 3 weeks. 12 In uncontrolled case studies, topical application of formulations containing sodium copper chlorophyllin complex demonstrated a reduction in facial redness, decreased pore size, and improved skin texture. 13 The present study was conducted to examine the effect of sodium copper chlorophyllin complex on the expression of biomarkers of photoaged dermal ECM indicative of skin repair. In this study, skin biopsy samples from the forearms of four healthy females with signs of photoaged skin were obtained and samples were analyzed for key biomarkers of aging skin after each subject was treated with a test material consisting of a treatment gel containing a liposomal dispersion of sodium copper chlorophyllin complex, 0.05% (Phytochromatic MD \u00ae Complex; MDRejuvena, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), a positive control of tretinoin cream, 0.025%, and a no treatment control. Tretinoin (retinoic acid) can repair photoaged dermal matrix and is regarded as the \"gold standard\" against which repair agents are judged. 14 ",

            "text": "A previous study demonstrated inhibition of hyaluronidase activity in vitro by sodium copper chlorophyllin complex. 10 Pilot clinical studies demonstrated that a topical formulation containing a liposomal dispersion of sodium copper chlorophyllin complex was clinically effective and well tolerated for the treatment of mild-to-moderate photodamage and solar lentigines, 11 mild-to-moderate acne and large visible pores, 12 and demonstrated a reduction in facial redness, decreased pore size, and improved skin texture. 13 In the present study, overall results from this single center, randomized, controlled, 12-day clinical trial indicate that both the test material Formula DR198-02 containing 0.05% sodium copper chlorophyllin complex and the positive control, tretinoin cream 0.025%, increased the presence of procollagen 1, fibrillin 1, and epidermal and dermal mucins, which are biomarkers of dermal repair, compared to the negative control. The changes in fibrillin 1 and epidermal mucins for both the test material and the positive control were statistically significant (P<0.05) when compared to no treatment. It was not possible to directly assess HA content in the biopsy specimens; therefore, the results reflect the effects of the test material on GAGs and fibrous proteins in general and are not specific to HA. However, assessments of changes in epidermal and dermal mucins were used as a surrogate method for measuring changes in hyaluronan in this study. Since hyaluronidase digestion in the Alcian blue staining method removed all increases observed for mucins, this would suggest that the changes observed before digestion were from HA, and not other GAGs or protein-bound mucopolysaccharides. The increases in epidermal and dermal mucins demonstrated by the 0.05% sodium copper chlorophyllin gives in vivo support to the hyaluronidase inhibitory activity of this compound that has previously demonstrated strong in vitro anti-hyaluronidase activity. 10 Analyses of the biopsy samples showed a statistically significant difference in favor of the test material and reference control for the presence of fibrillin/amyloid P and presence of epidermal mucins (Col/FE) when compared to the negative control (untreated). There was no statistical difference between the test material and reference control for any of the increases in the measured biomarkers.",

Retinoic acid is a widely used treatment and considered the gold standard for photoaged skin. 14,15 It has been demonstrated that all-trans-retinoic acid increases the synthesis of hyaluronan and upregulates hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2) and hyaluronan synthase 3 (Has3) gene expression in cultured rat epidermal keratinocytes, and appears to be mediated by epidermal growth factor. 16,17 A recent publication describes a topically applied antiaging product that improved the appearance of fine lines/wrinkles and skin hydration, presumably by promoting restoration of endogenous epidermal HA homeostasis. 18 Two products, Rejuvaphyl Rejuvenating Complex LS and Rejuvaphyl Rejuvenating Complex HS from MDRejuvena, contain both sodium copper chlorophyllin complex and retinol, thereby providing the potential for a dual approach to reversing age-related decreases in HA in the skin: inhibition of the breakdown of HA by sodium copper chlorophyllin complex by inhibition of hyaluronidase, and stimulation of HA synthases by retinol.",

The degree of repair seen with the sodium copper chlorophyllin complex and the positive control (tretinoin cream, United States Pharmacopeia 0.025%), based on immunohistological analysis, was not statistically different. The results support and validate recently published in vitro antihyaluronidase activity for sodium copper chlorophyllin complex. Topical retinoid and sodium copper chlorophyllin complex for repair of photoaged skin should be evaluated further in this biopsy model to quantify whether there is an additive or synergistic response with this unique combination of topical agents."
