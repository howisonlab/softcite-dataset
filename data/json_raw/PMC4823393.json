            "text": "Prehospital hypothermia is defined as a core temperature <36.0\u00b0C and has been shown to be an independent risk factor for early death in patients with trauma. In a retrospective study, a possible correlation between the body temperature at the time of admission to the emergency room and subsequent in-hospital transfusion requirements and the in-hospital mortality rate was explored. Setting: This is a retrospective single-centre study at a primary care hospital in Germany. Participants: 15 895 patients were included in this study. Patients were classified by admission temperature and transfusion rate. Excluded were ambulant patients and patients with missing data. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The primary outcome values were length of stay (LOS) in days, in-hospital mortality, the transferred amount of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and admission to an intensive care unit. Secondary influencing variables were the patient's age and the Glasgow Coma Scale. Results: In 22.85% of the patients, hypothermia was documented. Hypothermic patients died earlier in the course of their hospital stay than non-hypothermic patients (p<0.001). The administration of 1-3 PRBC increased the LOS significantly (p<0.001) and transfused patients had an increased risk of death (p<0.001). Prehospital hypothermia could be an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted OR 8.521; p=0.001) and increases the relative risk for transfusion by factor 2.0 (OR 2.007; p=0.002). Conclusions: Low body temperature at hospital admission is associated with a higher risk of transfusion and death. Hence, a greater awareness of prehospital temperature management should be established.",

            "text": "The incidence of prehospital hypothermia, defined as a core temperature below 36.0\u00b0C, is frequently observed in patients admitted to the emergency room (ER), 1 mainly due to a difficult and prolonged rescue, infusion of cold resuscitation fluids, 2 weather, age and a critical health condition. Hypothermia in combination with acidosis and coagulopathy is known as the lethal triad of death. 3 Hypothermia alters enzymatic reactions of the coagulation cascade during the initiation phase and decreases platelet function, 3 4 possibly leading to severe bleeding and consecutively required blood transfusion. It has been shown that the amount of applied fluids and transfused packed red blood cell (PRBC) is directly linked to hypothermia, is associated with a worse clinical outcome, 5 6 and increases the risk of postoperative mortality. 7 Acute complications after PRBC transfusion can comprise hypothermia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesiaemia, citrate toxicity, lactic acidosis and air embolism. 8 Additionally,",

Although it seems to be obvious that hypothermia might be a negative outcome factor during the rescue and recovery process, the incidence of hypothermia in EDs remains a commonly observed phenomenon. Heat loss that may be caused by the prolonged rescue time and severe injuries is prolonged throughout the transportation to the next ER due to a non-existing standardised prehospital warming management.",

Similar results are shown by Trentzsch et al, 5 whereas another paper found that patients with a body temperature <35.0\u00b0C and major trauma stayed longer at the hospital. 19 Compatible results in a retrospective paper by Martin et al 17 showed a significantly increased LOS and ICU admission rate for hypothermic patients with major trauma (<35.0\u00b0C) compared with normothermic patients ( p<0.001). The differences in our findings compared with the studies by Ireland et al and Martin et al may be caused either by their collective of patients or by the fact that the Kaplan-Meier analysis in our study revealed that hypothermic patients had an increased mortality rate and died earlier than patients with normal or febrile temperatures. Martin et al and Ireland et al mainly used results of patients with major trauma in their studies, whereas we included every patient admitted to the ED despite the injury severity score (ISS). Our results revealed that hyperthermic patients had the longest LOS and were more often admitted to the ICU. We suggest that those patients were septic or in another febrile critical health condition that needed intensive treatment.",
