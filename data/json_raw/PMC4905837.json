Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were infected with NDV, and quantitative analysis of apoptotic cells was performed using flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity and anti-viral activities of baicalin were studied using the MTT method. The results showed that the maximal safe concentrations of baicalin to CEFs was 1 \u00d7 2 \u22122 mg/ml. Baicalin could directly kill NDV, inhibit the infectivity of NDV to CEF and block intracellular NDV. It inhibited the apoptosis of NDV-infected CEFs and suppressed the spread of NDV. These results indicate that baicalin has strong anti-NDV activity and has the potential for use as components of an antiviral drug.",

            "text": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a complete and independent medical system, which has been used to diagnose, treat and prevent illnesses for thousands of years. Since the World Health Organization began exploring TCM in the 1950s, TCM has garnered increasing interest beyond China because of its particular therapeutic methods and effects. Currently, in many countries, TCM provides patients with a new array of therapeutic options [1,11]. In recent years, it has been proved that many TCMs and their ingredients possess antiviral effects [15]. Some TCMs and their extracts, such as shuanghuanglian injections, a common patented Chinese drug, have been developed into antiviral agents. TCM has many biological activities, such as adjusting immunologic function [18], inhibiting viral proliferation and contributing to infection processes (adsorption, transcription, replication and release) [5], and provides reliable biological functions with little side effects and low toxicity. However, TCM also has many antiviral active materials and is rarely used in animal medicine today.",

Baicalin has demonstrated an ability to inhibit influenza A (H1N1) infection in vitro and protect cells from apoptosis damage through regulation of the cell cycle and suppression of the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. Downregulation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 is significant and shows a dose-dependent relationship [30].",

It affects more than 250 bird species and typically manifests with respiratory, gastrointestinal and/or nervous system symptoms. The most severe form of Newcastle disease can result in mortality rates exceeding 90% in susceptible chicken flocks. The Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes significant economic losses worldwide every year [22]. Thus far, this disease was mainly controlled with ND vaccines. Antiviral treatments are not available in poultry owing to their cost and toxicity, and thus, a promising alternative is the use of compounds of natural origin, which have been underexplored for this purpose [28]. Some Chinese veterinary herbal medical preparations, such as Shuanghuanglian injection, and injection of Astragalus polysaccharides have become one of the principal weapons in veterinary clinical therapy and play an important role in clinical epidemic prevention [31]. However, these preparations have not displayed satisfactory clinical effects for ND. Research and development of effective clinical medicines are still one of the primary tasks of many veterinary researchers.",

The highest virus inhibition rates and the highest virus neutralization rates of the baicalin groups were both higher than 100%.

The stages of apoptosis can be categorized into early and late, and the sum of the stages represents the total apoptosis rate.

However, their toxicity is higher than that of baicalin is, and only flavone prescriptions with suitable compatibility can show good anti-viral activity [31]. Some polysaccharides from TCM also could inhibit NDV infection of cells, such as Chuanmingshen violaceum polysaccharide, Auricularia auricula polysaccharide and Tremella polysaccharide. Anti-viral activity of these polysaccharides is insufficient, but sulfation could increase their anti-NDV activity [21,24,32].",
