            "text": "The fastest-evolving regions in the human and chimpanzee genomes show a remarkable excess of weak (A,T) to strong (G,C) nucleotide substitutions since divergence from their common ancestor. We investigated the phylogenetic extent and possible causes of this weak to strong (W/S) bias in divergent sequences (BDS) using recently sequenced genomes and recombination maps from eight trios of eukaryotic species. To quantify evidence for BDS, we inferred substitution histories using an efficient maximum likelihood approach with a context-dependent evolutionary model. We then annotated all lineage-specific substitutions in terms of W/S bias and density on the chromosomes. Finally, we used the inferred substitutions to calculate a BDS score-a log odds ratio between substitution type and density-and assessed its statistical significance with Fisher's exact test. Applying this approach, we found significant BDS in the coding and noncoding sequence of human, mouse, dog, stickleback, fruit fly, and worm. We also observed a significant lack of W/S BDS in chicken and yeast. The BDS score varies between species and across the chromosomes within each species. It is most strongly correlated with different genomic features in different species, but a strong correlation with recombination rates is found in several species. Our results demonstrate that a W/S substitution bias in fast-evolving sequences is a widespread phenomenon. The patterns of BDS observed suggest that a recombination-associated process, such as GC-biased gene conversion, is involved in the production of the bias in many species, but the strength of the BDS likely depends on many factors, including genome stability, variability in recombination rate over time and across the genome, the frequency of meiosis, and the amount of outcrossing in each species."

            "text": "The recent sequencing of the genomes of many closely related species has created a powerful new paradigm for investigating the evolutionary processes that generate the diversity of life on Earth. Comparing the complete human genome sequence to that of a chimpanzee, our closest living relative, Dreszer et al. (2007) demonstrated that the most divergent regions of both genomes show a striking W/S substitution bias and that this association is correlated with recombination rates. This bias in divergent sequences (BDS) is not limited to neutrally evolving sequences and can significantly impact substitution patterns in conserved noncoding sequences (Pollard, Salama, King et al. 2006) and proteincoding exons (Berglund et al. 2009;Ratnakumar et al. 2010), suggesting the possibility of significant functional consequences. These observations have profound implications regarding the interpretation of adaptive evolution in fast-evolving sequences of the human genome and our understanding of the evolutionary forces driving divergence between closely related species in general.",

First, is BDS unique to the hominoids or a more widespread phenomenon? The recent sequencing of many closely related eukaryotic species enables us to investigate the phylogenetic extent of BDS. Second, what evolutionary processes produce BDS? Based on the patterns of BDS found in human, Dreszer et al.

This approach accounts directly for CpG hypermutability and other context effects that can lead to incorrect inference of substitution type (e.g., W/S vs. not W/S) in parsimony-based analyses. Next, we analyzed substitution patterns using a new efficient statistical test for the association of nucleotide substitution types with substitution rates and genome annotations. Most previous studies of substitution patterns in divergent regions have focused on discrete predefined elements across the genome; in contrast, our approach is more broad and allows a flexible continuous definition of ''divergent'' based on the density of substitution across the genome. Our work extends the approach of Dreszer et al. (2007) and provides a more rigorous statistical framework for measuring associations between substitution type and density.",

Our analysis of nonprimate clades shows that BDS is common outside of human, though not universal. When BDS is present, it exists in both coding and noncoding sequence and is often, but not always, correlated with high rates of recombination. This correlation, paired with the lack of W/S bias in within-species polymorphisms, argues that a recombination-driven fixation bias for strong nucleotides, such as that produced by gBGC, may be involved in the production of BDS, especially when there is variation in strength and location of gBGC over time. Overall, the strong evidence we find for BDS in many eukaryote genomes highlights the importance of understanding its causes and developing statistical models of DNA and protein evolution that incorporate these observations."

When more than one precomputed alignment was available for a reference species, we chose the most phylogenetically restricted. For chicken, we did not consider the microchromosomes (International Chicken Genome Sequencing Consortium 2004) in our analysis. The following genome assemblies were used (UCSC identifiers): hg18, panTro2, rheMac2, mm9, rn4, cavPor2, canFam2, felCat3, bosTau4, Each trio of species contains a reference (red branch), comparison, and outgroup species. Substitutions occurring on the branch leading to the reference species from the last common ancestor with the comparison species were considered. The color of each box reflects the strength of the BDS in the associated species.

We refer to this log odds ratio as the BDS score and use the terms ''bias,'' ''BDS,'' and ''W/S BDS'' to refer to increased W/S substitution in regions of high divergence. The genomic regions over which the BDS score was calculated may be small sequence blocks (as used in the correlation analysis), a set of regions across the genome (as in the coding sequence analysis), or the entire genome.

It is possible that the length of the branch considered might affect 1) our power to detect BDS and 2) the estimated strength of the BDS between the two species compared. Several observations argue against such biases, however. First, significant BDS patterns were observed in all comparisons. Hence, even though branch length likely influences the test's power, we are still able to detect a signal in each lineage. Additionally, the strength of the BDS observed between two species is not well correlated with their divergence (table 1). We also calculated BDS in substitutions between human and a series of increasingly divergent species that mirror the divergences of the other eukaryotic species sets considered here. In three of the four comparisons (human with tarsier, tree shrew, and opossum), significant bias was still identifiable between human and the more distant comparison species (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). However, the fact that W/S BDS was not found in one of the comparisons (human with marmoset) suggests that the sources of BDS may not be constant over time or that our ability to detect BDS depends upon the quality of the comparison genome. We also tested the use of increasingly divergent outgroup species and found no major influence on patterns of BDS. Thus, our method is able to detect bias within the range of divergence found in the species sets we analyzed, including those used to quantify BDS in chicken and yeast. We therefore conclude that factors other than evolutionary distance appear to drive the variation in BDS between lineages.",

Table 2 demonstrates that in species with significant genome-wide BDS, significant bias is present in coding sequence considered alone. Interestingly, coding regions generally exhibit stronger BDS than noncoding sequence. Similarly, coding sequence in yeast and chicken show S/W BDS, in agreement with the genome-wide evidence of S/W BDS in these species. The S/W bias in chicken coding regions is of similar magnitude to the genome-wide amount, but is not significant. This is not surprising given the weak signal in chicken genome wide. These results argue that patterns of bias in coding and noncoding sequences are usually in agreement and that the different fraction of coding sequence in different genomes is unlikely to be the source of their different bias patterns.",

All of these observations are consistent with a recombination-associated, nonadaptive fixation bias as a cause of BDS. gBGC is a likely candidate. This bias occurs when there is a weak-strong polymorphism in a recombination heteroduplex, and the DNA mismatch is preferentially repaired to the strong base pair. These GC-biased conversion blocks are thought to range between 200 bp and 2 kb in length (Duret and Galtier 2009). gBGC has been directly observed in yeast (Mancera et al. 2008), but obtaining experimental evidence for the action of gBGC is extremely challenging in other species. Nonetheless, gBGC has received considerable attention as a possible explanation for many dominant and unexplained genomic attributes, such as the large-scale variation in GC content (the so-called isochore structure) of mammalian genomes (Eyre-Walker and Hurst 2001;Galtier et al. 2001;Meunier and Duret 2004;Romiguier et al. 2010). By driving strong alleles to higher frequencies and ultimately to fixation around recombination hotspots, bursts of gBGC could result in an increase in substitution rates and a W/S-biased substitution pattern (Berglund et al. 2009). These evolutionary events could produce the BDS pattern.",

However, the action of a biased mutation rate is not consistent with our observations. Specifically, the lack of W/S BDS in SNPs argues against mutation bias as a source of the BDS pattern. The relationship between BDS and selection is less clear. If natural selection on GC content drives BDS, we would expect consistent differences in bias between regions of high and low conservation, such as coding and noncoding sequence. In most of the taxa we examined, significant BDS is present in both coding and noncoding sequence, and higher in coding regions. In addition, three species (mouse, dog, and fly) show a significant correlation between genome-wide patterns of BDS and evolutionary conservation. But the three other species with significant BDS (human, stickleback, and worm) show no such correlation. If selection has a role in BDS, we might additionally expect BDS to be stronger in species with large effective population sizes due to the increased efficiency of selection; however, this pattern is not observed. Thus, selective forces may be involved in the creation of BDS in some lineages, perhaps in concert with gBGC, but they are unlikely to be the sole cause of BDS. Together, these results suggest that there may multiple causes and paths to the creation of BDS in genomes.",

However, yeast differs from the other species we analyzed in a number of relevant genetic and physiological dimensions. Several aspects of sensu stricto yeast biology could act to limit gBGC's mutagenic impact. Most wild yeasts studied to date have very low frequencies of sex and outcrossing; recent work estimates that S. paradoxus undergoes meiosis only once in every 1,000 generations and only 1% of matings are outcrossed (Tsai et al. 2008). Since gBGC requires both meiosis and heterozygosity, its effect may be reduced in yeast by a factor of approximately 10 5 compared with obligately outcrossed species (Marais et al. 2004;Gl\u00e9 min et al. 2006;Tsai et al. 2010;Harrison and Charlesworth 2011). The resulting reduced mutagenic impact of gBGC has been proposed as an explanation for several differences in genomic patterns between yeast and other eukaryotes, such as the conservation of recombination hotspots (Tsai et al. 2010). Thus, the lack of detectable BDS in yeast is not inconsistent with the theory that gBGC is involved in creating BDS in other species.",

Since BDS likely results from episodic gBGC (either in time or across the chromosome), this relative lack of variation would produce less difference between divergent and nondivergent sequences in mouse.

            "text": "The presence of BDS in many HARs prompted the suggestion that gBGC, rather than positive selection, may have generated the acceleration (Galtier and Duret 2007). Thus, we might expect that HARs showing strong evidence of gBGC would be less likely to have obtained new functions in human. HAR1 and HAR2 (HACNS1), the two fastest evolving HARs, have strikingly biased substitution patterns. However, there is strong experimental evidence of function maintenance in HAR1 (Pollard, Salama, Lambert, et al. 2006) and gain in HAR2 (Prabhakar et al. 2008)-a surprising result if the human-specific changes in these sequences were created by a purely neutral mutational process. Therefore, we hypothesize that in some evolutionary scenarios, gBGC substitutions may themselves lead to novel functions or may set the stage for later adaptive changes, perhaps due to compensatory substitutions driven by selection.",

            "text": "In this study, we used efficient statistical methods to highlight phylogenetic patterns of a substitution bias. Our analysis of BDS in many eukaryotes suggests that it is common outside of human. Episodic gBGC driven by recombination is likely to play a major role in the production of BDS, but a number of evolutionary and organismal factors are likely to influence its occurrence. These conclusions underscore the importance of developing models of sequence evolution that incorporate the action of gBGC and other processes that interact with selection (Hurst 2009). Several promising preliminary steps have been made in the modeling of gBGC and selection (Duret and Arndt 2008;Berglund et al. 2009;Ratnakumar et al. 2010;Gl\u00e9 min 2010). As more genomes are assembled and richer recombination and polymorphism data become available for multiple species, we will be able to develop a deeper understanding of the causes and effects of BDS across the tree of life.",
