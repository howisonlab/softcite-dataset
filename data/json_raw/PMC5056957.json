            "text": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity prevention during adolescence is a health priority. The 'Physical Activity 4 Everyone' (PA4E1) study tested a multi-component physical activity intervention in 10 secondary schools from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. This paper aimed to report the secondary outcomes of the study; to determine whether the intervention impacted on adiposity outcomes (weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score), and whether any effect was moderated by sex, baseline BMI and baseline physical activity level, at 12 and 24 months. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. The school-based intervention included seven physical activity strategies targeting the following: curriculum (strategies to maximise physical activity in physical education, student physical activity plans, an enhanced school sport programme); school environment (physical activity during school breaks, modification of school policy); and parents and the community (parent engagement, links with community physical activity providers). Students' weight (kg), BMI and BMI z-score, were collected at baseline (Grade 7), 12 and 24 months. Linear Mixed Models were used to assess between-group mean difference from baseline to 12 and 24 months. Exploratory sub-analyses were undertaken according to three moderators of energy balance. RESULTS: A total of 1150 students (mean age = 12 years) provided outcome data at baseline, 1051 (91%) at 12 months and 985 (86%) at 24 months. At 12 months, there were group-by-time effects for weight (mean difference =-0.90 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) =-1.50, \u2212 0.30), P o 0.01) and BMI (\u22120.28 kg m \u2212 2 (\u22120.50, \u2212 0.06), P = 0.01) in favour of the intervention group, but not for BMI z-score (\u22120.05 (\u22120.11; 0.01), P = 0.13). These findings were consistent for weight (\u22120.62 kg (\u22121.21, 0.03), P = 0.01) and BMI (\u22120.28 kg m \u2212 2 (\u22120.49, \u2212 0.06), P = 0.01) at 24 months, with group-by-time effects also found for BMI z-score (\u22120.08 (\u22120.14; \u2212 0.02), P = 0.02) favouring the intervention group. CONCLUSION: The PA4E1 school-based intervention achieved moderate reductions in adiposity among adolescents from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Multi-component interventions that increase adolescents' engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) may assist in preventing unhealthy weight gain.",

            "text": "Preventing obesity during adolescence is a public health priority. 1 Internationally, among adolescent populations (10-19 years), the prevalence of overweight and obesity is estimated to be between 20-30%, 2 and is increasing. 3 During puberty, adolescents experience changes in body composition and physical fitness, and decreased insulin sensitivity. 1 Changes in eating behaviours, physical activity, sedentary behaviours and psychological wellbeing may also occur during this critical period of growth and development. 1 These behavioural and physiological changes increase the risk of overweight and obesity during adolescence. 1 Global self-reported data from 105 countries estimate that just 20% of adolescents participate in \u2a7e 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) each day. 4 Longitudinal studies have also shown a decline in physical activity during adolescence of~7% of MVPA per year. 5 Research across 32 countries in Europe, Israel and North America indicates a positive association between physical inactivity and socioeconomic disadvantage in adolescents. 6 The school environment is a recommended setting for the promotion of physical activity among adolescents; 7 however, school-based physical activity interventions have resulted in only a small increase in objectively measured MVPA (~4 min per day) of children, and limited reductions in the adiposity of adolescents. 8 A systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 studies (including 18 141 students) that aimed to determine the effect of schoolbased physical activity interventions (46 months duration) on body mass index (BMI) in children and adolescents found that neither BMI (mean difference = \u2212 0.05 kg m \u2212 2 , 95% CI (confidence interval): \u2212 0.19; 0.10) nor any other body composition measures improved. 9 The review primarily included elementary-aged students in Grades 3-6, and 15 of the 18 studies included a nutrition co-intervention. The lack of an overall effect on BMI was explained by insufficient intervention dose, either due to the amount of physical activity or low intervention compliance by the students. 9 In a more recent meta-analysis of 43 studies (involving 36 579 children) that aimed to evaluate the impact of nutrition and physical activity school-based interventions on BMI in children and adolescents ( o18 years old), studies that assessed physical activity-only interventions reduced BMI by \u2212 0.13 kg m \u2212 2 (\u22120.22; \u2212 0.04). 10 Intervention duration ranged from 1 month to 6 years. 10 Neither of the reviews reported the physical activity intervention findings separately for adolescents, 9,10 precluding the drawing of conclusions regarding the effect of physical activity interventions on adiposity in adolescent populations.",

            "text": "School curriculum 1. 'Teaching strategies to maximise student physical activity in health and physical education (PE) lessons'. PE teachers received two professional learning workshops (conducted at 6-month intervals) that focused on (i) increasing motivation and MVPA in PE lessons to meet the target of 50% of PE lesson time in MVPA recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 28 (ii) an implementation guide for delivering the 10-week enhanced school sport programme (that is, Program X) and (iii) recommended procedures for fitness testing and 'personal best' days. A final booster session provided a summary of all concepts and strategies included in the PA4E1 intervention. 2. 'Development and monitoring of student physical activity plans within PE lessons'. The student physical activity plans focused on (i) short-and long-term physical activity, (ii) actions and timelines, (iii) fitness assessments, (iv) recording actions and goal achievements, and (v) rewards for goal attainment (for example, balls, wrist bands and drink bottles). 29 3. 'Implementation of an enhanced school sports programme'. All students participated in a 10-week enhanced school sport programme during school sport. The programme was based on Program X, which was originally designed for less-active students. 25,[30][31][32] School environment 4. 'Development and modification of school policies'. School policies were established or modified with the aim of enhancing students' physical activity. 33,34 For example; incorporating pedometer-based lessons with PE, offering the enhanced school sport programme as a standard school sport option, routinely providing physical activity information to parents. 5. 'Physical activity programmes during school breaks'. Schools were provided with physical activity equipment (for example, balls, skipping equipment) and encouraged to offer supervised physical activity on at least 2 days per week during recess and lunch breaks. 35 Partnership and services 6. 'Promotion of community physical activity providers (community links)'. 33,36 Schools were supported to host a physical activity expo that promoted local physical activity providers to students in Grade 8. Community physical activity providers were also promoted in school newsletters. 7. 'Parent engagement'. Information was regularly sent to the parents via existing school newsletters, the school website and PA4E1 newsletters on physical activity recommendations, school-based physical activity strategies, promotion of community physical activity providers and strategies to support their child's physical activity. 31,37 Four of the seven intervention strategies were implemented during the first 12 months (strategies 1, 2, 5 and 7 above). The remaining strategies were implemented over the next 12 months, with delivery of the initial strategies being maintained. The intervention strategies, particularly those under the curriculum domain, included a range of behaviour-change techniques with students 15,38 such as the provision of information about the behaviour and the consequences, general encouragement, prompting specific goal setting and a review of behavioural goals, prompting self-monitoring, prompting practice, modelling and demonstrating the behaviour, and the provision of feedback on performance. 38 The intervention further used six strategies to support the implementation of the seven physical activity intervention strategies listed above. The intervention implementation strategies included (i) an in-school physical activity consultant 1 day per week (change agent position), 36 (ii) establishing leadership and support, (iii) teacher training, 39,40 (iv) resources, (v) teacher prompts 41 and (vi) intervention implementation performance feedback to schools. 42 ",

A three-level hierarchical model was used to capture correlations in the data with random intercepts for repeat measures (level 1), on individuals (level 2) and clustering within schools (level 3). The LMM analyses aimed to determine if there was a significant difference in mean change from baseline to 12 months and baseline to 24 months between intervention and control groups for each outcome measure, both assessed using an interaction term between treatment group (intervention vs. control) and time (baseline vs. 12 months and baseline vs. 24 months). Two sensitivity analyses were conducted, first using only those that provided complete adiposity outcomes at all three time points (complete cases), and second using multiple imputation to fill in the missing data. The multiple imputation model used the method of chained regression equations, including variables that were prognostic of missing data and additional demographic and outcome data to create five imputed data sets. The results from fitting the LMM were pooled over the five data sets using Rubin's method. 56 Sub-analyses. Exploratory sub-analyses (defined a priori) were undertaken to determine whether the intervention impacted on the outcome measures for students according to three moderators of energy balance (i) sex (male; female), (ii) baseline BMI (underweight/healthy weight; overweight/obese) and (iii) baseline physical activity level (active; inactive). The moderator interaction terms were included in individual LMM analyses for each outcome, and the P-value for the three-way interaction term (group \u00d7 time \u00d7 moderator) was used to assess the level of evidence against the null hypothesis of no effect modification.

The intervention had a favourable impact on adiposity outcomes, having a moderate effect on weight and BMI at 12 months, and weight, BMI and BMI z-score at 24 months. A difference in BMI of \u2212 0.28 kg m \u2212 2 over 24 months between intervention and control groups is twice the effect found in a meta-analysis of 11 schoolbased physical activity intervention studies (\u22120.13 kg m \u2212 2 ). 10 However, of the 11 physical activity interventions, only 2 were conducted in secondary schools and only 1 of these during school  (11,13) 12 (11,13) 13 (12,14) 13 (12,14) 14 (  time. 10 In the latter study, the effectiveness of a 12-week school exercise training programme was tested in 24 obese, adolescent males, and found a significant intervention effect of \u2212 0.59 kg m \u2212 2 (95% CI = \u2212 1.4; 0.23). 57 The small sample in a high-risk, single-sex obese subgroup and the short intervention duration makes it difficult to equate to PA4E1. In an earlier meta-analysis of 18 studies, the intervention effect on BMI was much lower at \u2212 0.05 kg m \u2212 2 (\u22120.19; 0.10). 9 However, only two of the 18 studies exclusively investigated the effect of a physical activity intervention in middle-or secondary-school students. 9 The exploratory subgroup analyses found a significant effect at 24 months, favouring the intervention group on (i) weight among male adolescents, and (ii) weight, BMI and BMI z-score among underweight/healthy weight adolescents. There were no treatment effects on any of the adiposity measures for the other subgroups examined including females, overweight/obese students or active/inactive students. Although the moderator analyses indicate that the PA4E1 intervention was effective in limiting weight and BMI increases in the underweight/healthy weight subgroup, there was no evidence that the intervention had an adverse effect on underweight students as the proportion of underweight students decreased during the study, from 7.3% at baseline to 2.5% at 24 months. Weight, BMI and BMI z-score increased in both intervention and control underweight/healthy weight students, but increased to a lesser extent among students in the intervention group.",

For this reason the authors of the HEALTHY study 58 have suggested that although population-based primary prevention interventions should continue to target all children, the study aim and primary outcomes should be evaluated in the highest-risk subgroup (overweight/obese adolescents) instead of the entire cohort. Although there were no significant intervention effects in the PA4E1 overweight/obese subgroup, the adiposity results for the intervention group are trending in the hypothesised direction and the effect was larger than that found in the main analysis and among healthy weight/underweight students. A lack of significant findings in overweight and obese students is likely to be a sample size issue, as the disproportionate number of adolescents in each weight status group may have contributed to the sub-analyses being underpowered.",

Similar proportions of overweight and obese adolescents were reported in ICAPS (23%) and PA4E1 (22%), and neither of the studies found significant adiposity effects on adolescents who were initially overweight or obese.

            "text": "Although the adiposity results are unlikely to be clinically significant at an individual level, the reduced adiposity trajectory may produce health benefits at a population level and over an individual's lifetime. A 1% reduction in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in 16-17-year-old adolescents today has been projected to reduce the number of obese adults by 52 821 in the future, decrease total lifetime medical costs by $586.3 million dollars and increase the quality-adjusted life years by 47 138 years. 65 The positive effect of PA4E1 on adiposity may have occurred due to the increase in objectively measured MVPA of 7 more minutes of MVPA per day than the control students at 24 months. 16 The PA4E1 intervention was a multi-component and socio-ecologically framed school-based intervention, key elements of which have been recommended to increase physical activity and reduce the prevalence of obesity during adolescence. 11,12 The intervention addressed educational, curricular and environmental changes in the school, supported by evidence from recent systematic reviews of school-based interventions. 13,14 A 'change agent', who was a trained PE teacher, visited each of the intervention schools 1 day per week for the duration of the intervention to support the school and PE teachers in implementing the strategies (the change agent did not deliver any classes). The use of strategies within a sustainable framework of PA4E1 makes it a potentially scalable intervention. The intervention could be disseminated more broadly in secondary schools by education departments, and therefore, warrants dissemination evaluation. This PA4E1 study had several strengths including the RCT design, the long intervention duration and a large sample size. The study included a suite of intervention implementation strategies based on the theoretical frameworks and evidence from past school-based physical activity reviews. Analyses were repeated using complete cases only and multiple imputation which reported similar results to the main analysis with regard to weight, BMI and BMI z-score, suggesting that the findings are robust. A number of limitations of the study need to be acknowledged. Although BMI is an acceptable measure of change in adiposity, direct measures, such as dual-energy radiography absorptiometry, give a more accurate measure of adiposity. 66 Although the study was implemented over a 24-month period, the study did not assess whether the adiposity differences were sustained in the longer term once the 'change agent' ceased visiting the intervention schools. The students were recruited from moderate-to-large sized, socio-economically disadvantaged schools from one area in Australia, which may reduce the generalisability of the findings. The study did not collect maturation data from students. The study is likely to be underpowered for the subgroup analyses so these findings should be interpreted with caution, as the lack of a treatment effect may have been due to type II error (failing to detect an effect that is present). Assessment of the cost and cost effectiveness of the PA4E1 intervention will be reported in a separate paper.",

The results from the PA4E1 intervention provide evidence for a multi-component physical activity intervention implemented in secondary schools to have a moderate effect on adiposity outcomes at the population level among adolescents from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Multi-component interventions that increase adolescents' engagement in MVPA may assist in preventing overweight and obesity.",
