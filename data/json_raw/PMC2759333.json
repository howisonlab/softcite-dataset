            "text": "Conversion disorder ('hysteria') was largely considered to be a neurological problem in the 19th century, but without a neuropathological explanation it was commonly assimilated with malingering. The theories of Janet and Freud transformed hysteria into a psychiatric condition, but as such models decline in popularity and a neurobiology of conversion has yet to be found, today's neurologists once again face a disorder without an accepted model. This article explores how today's neurologists understand conversion through in-depth interviews with 22 neurology consultants. The neurologists endorsed psychological models but did not understand their patients in such terms. Rather, they distinguished conversion from other unexplained conditions clinically by its severity and inconsistency. While many did not see this as clearly distinct from feigning, they did not feel that this was their problem to resolve. They saw themselves as 'agnostic' regarding non-neuropathological explanations. However, since neurologists are in some ways more expert in conversion than psychiatrists, their continuing support for the deception model is important, and begs an explanation. One reason for the model's persistence may be that it is employed as a diagnostic device, used to differentiate between those unexplained symptoms that could, in principle, have a medical explanation and those that could not.",

In the UK such patients comprise some 30-60% of neurological outpatients (Carson et al., 2000;Nimnuan et al., 2001). However, this mass of symptoms may not all be 'unexplained' in the same way. While some may be unexplained because they are at the limits of knowledge, there are others where doctors are inclined to infer explanations, but not physiological ones. Hysteria is (or was) one of the latter. But why should this be the case, and on what grounds?",

            "text": "Though hysteria was 're-medicalized' during the Renaissance, after many years in which it was treated as a religious phenomenon (Micale, 1995), doctors still found it to be different. Seventeenth-century physicians such as Thomas Sydenham were struck that it seemed to be brought on by emotion (Veith, 1993), and by the 19th century it was widely agreed that hysteria could be caused and cured by psychosocial factors, as reported for example, by Robert Carter (Carter, 1853), Silas Weir Mitchell (Mitchell, 1885) and Jean-Martin Charcot (Charcot, 1889). Furthermore, it did not fit with the mechanics afforded by the 19th century advances in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, and neurologists struggled to explain its symptoms on the basis of conscious or unconscious behaviour. Both Carter and Weir Mitchell saw conscious deception as being the mechanism of the later stages of hysteria but Charcot resisted this inference, even though it had been his clinical-anatomic method which had shown the absence of explanatory lesions in the brains of hysterics. He insisted that a 'functional' lesion would be found when microscopes were sufficiently powerful, and offered the first systematic psychological theory of hysteria, as hypnosis, until that time (Shorter, 1992). Although his theory did not survive his death, his great achievement, according to Freud, 'was to restore dignity to the topic. Little by little, people gave up the scornful smile with which the patient could at that time feel certain of being met. She was no longer necessarily a malingerer, for Charcot had thrown the whole weight of his authority on the side of the genuineness and objectivity of hysterical phenomena.' (Freud, 1953) Charcot's theory was rapidly supplanted by the more resilient theories of his students, Pierre Janet (dissociation) and Sigmund Freud (conversion). Since then hysteria has been considered a psychiatric disorder, and the problem of diagnosis properly one for psychiatrists. And although 'Hysteria' is no longer used in the psychiatric manuals, the psychological concepts associated with it still are. The diagnostic schema ICD-10 (WHO, 1992) and DSM-IV (APA, 1994) employ the categories of 'Dissociative (Conversion) Disorder' and 'Conversion Disorder', respectively, to describe motor and sensory symptoms that lack a neurological explanation, which are not feigned and where a psychosocial explanation can be demonstrated. However, the requirement for such an explanation is a problem for psychiatrists as the Freudian orthodoxy declines, and the hope of a neuropsychological alternative remains unfulfilled (Kozlowska, 2005). The diagnostic criteria are now widely considered unreliable or invalid (Wessely, 2001), and the psychiatric community is searching for a way to replace them (Mayou et al., 2005).",

When perhaps the majority of their patients' symptoms are to some extent unexplained, on what basis do they single out a special 'conversion' group?

R.K. interviewed the neurologists at a time and place of their choosing, the interview taking between 35 and 70 min. These were 'depth interviews' which employed a topic guide to provide a bare structure, with the material covered adapted to each interview. The subject was 'conversion disorder' and no definition of this was offered by the interviewer. The topics included the neurologist's background, training and current practice, examples of memorable or current patients considered to have 'conversion disorder', the neurologist's definitions, exclusions, models and diagnostic practices. Interviews were digitally audio-recorded and transcribed, and were inductively analysed using NVIVO 7 software. Transcripts were coded by question, and, iteratively, by emerging themes, consistent with an approach known as grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967).

S13Some made this distinction in part on the type of symptomsconversion presented with more 'florid' symptoms such as paralysis, seizures or blindness. By contrast, the symptoms which neurologists considered to have an undiscovered physical basis tended to be 'mild', 'normal', 'physiological' occurrences over which the patient had unnecessary concern-a sort of health anxiety which the neurologist could readily understand: How many times do I . . . wake up with a tingle here or a tingle there . . . and you think, ''Oh . . . there's nothing majorly amiss'', while there are other people who will think, ''Oh my god, there's something wrong . . . I need to go and see my doctor'' . . . That's not conversion disorder. S14Well, some of their symptoms are probably organically based, it's just that the importance to which they attach them is different . . . and I say it's hard enough for me as a neurologist to know whether the symptoms are going to be serious enough, so how can we expect you to know . . .

Those who adduced the 'textbook' psychological model did not expound their model in a more sustained way. Its advocates would argue for it on the basis that it was what they had been told, or taught, and it wasn't necessarily their own view-even that it was not really of their concern, as it was outside of their field: The major exception to this came from the neurologist who never saw 'conversion' and doubted it existed. This doctor treated only headache, but also had a well-developed explanatory and therapeutic (cognitive-behavioural) model in which they were actively engaged. But for most, the neurologists' involvement ended with excluding 'electrical' explanations, they did not have the time or the need to address the question of what did explain it-including whether it might be explained by conscious behaviour: I can't help being intellectually curious about it. But on an everyday level, no . . .

In an attempt to assess the latter, subjects were asked to speculate on the views of the interviewer. Most insisted that they had no idea: 'I don't know, you've been entirely bland, I don't know.' (S05) But those who offered a guess at the interviewer's views did tend to say 'the same as me' (S13), or a more flattering version, such as 'a slightly more sophisticated way of what we're saying' (S06). And those who expressed a categorical view said they thought the interviewer would take a biological perspective: 'I would guess that you have an organic model of psychiatry' (S22).

This tells us that many neurologists like to see their authority and responsibility ending when the neuropathological explanation has been excluded: they can be 'agnostic' about what other explanations are effective, whether these are psychological or social. This is an appealing position, supported by both neurology (Hallett, 2006) and psychiatry (Miller, 1988). The exclusion of organic pathology can be done effectively (Stone et al., 2005), and the confusion about mechanisms left to psychiatrists. But there are problems with this 'agnostic' stance.",

This would seem to put neurologists in the difficult position of operating outside of their perceived expertise. But there are several ways in which expertise can be understood: it might reflect a particular understanding, a therapeutic technique, or extensive experience. On the basis of experience, neurologists could clearly claim considerably greater expertise than psychiatrists. And, as described in the introduction, the psychiatric claim to greater insight or therapeutic expertise is also in question as psychoanalytic models continue to lose ground within the profession. Neurological expertise may be importantly different, but they are experts nonetheless.",

The neurologists had a hierarchy of the unexplained, dividing them into those which could probably be explained (if circumstances permitted) and those which could not possibly be so in the current scheme. Thus 'impossibility' would seem to be how conversion was identified. And saying a symptom was 'impossible' would seem to imply that there must be some kind of different explanation, without saying what kind of explanation that is-an agnostic position. But deciding that something is impossible-that it is incommensurate with a scientific modelcannot readily be done in practice: there are always further conditions, further refinements which can be made to accommodate exceptions (Feyerabend, 1970). Consider the example most cited, of the gross inconsistency between function on-and-off the examination couch. This is certainly odd, but not clearly impossible: it merely requires an impairment which varies with the context, of which there are multiple other examples from neurology. Some additional, prior conception is required-something which argues that this kind of inconsistency is different from the inconsistencies that could be physically explained. That conception could be 'malingering'-conscious control: the neurologist could compare the symptoms with those that they might themselves consciously adduce. The gross inconsistency of their patient would not be impossible therefore, but it would be implausible: it would be exactly what they would do if they were pretending to be paralysed.",

Conversion patients are just those with particular patterns of symptoms, of inconsistency, of disability, of illness behaviour, of how they make neurologists feel. But then the question would be why this cluster of negative features comes to be associated together, and why is there this residual association with 'malingering', after 100 years of psychiatric orthodoxy saying otherwise?",

Patients with conversion disorder have deceptive, behavioural or psychological characteristics that evoke these responses in people. They are just unlucky enough to have a condition, a 'natural kind' (Kendell and Jablensky, 2003) that makes people dislike and distrust them. But this does seem to objectify the dislikeable and to blame the patient, so the alternative view has been that these characteristics are actually features of the neurologist: patients with conversion put the neurologist in the unwelcome position of having to admit the limits of their competence, which the neurologist projects onto their hapless patient as dislike. This view updates a long tradition in hysteria revisionism, which has sought explanations for hysteria in the broader relationships of doctors with their patients-for example, in the historical reinterpretation of hysteria as misogyny (Micale, 1995). But it does not explain why just these patients, of all the unexplained, should be thought of in this way. The third view, the view we present here, is somewhat different, and is in essence that 'malingering' is actually the preferred model for the neurologists-it is the defining conception we searched for above, and any other pejorative associations flow from that.",

None of those interviewed took the kind of absolutist position they recognized from their training, the view that conversion was just malingering, that there was nothing wrong with them. But deception remained a pervasive issue, and a core diagnostic issue-either as a suspicion to be combated, or as a reality to be accommodated. The contention here is that deception is a pervasive issue because that is how at least some neurologists understand their patients. Such an understanding may not be surprising. The neurologist has no available neuropathological explanation. Deception of a trivial kind, in the form of innocuous simulation, is part of the core encounter of the conversion patient (Kanaan, in press): the patient presents with what looks at first like epilepsy or a stroke, but is not. The neurologist can accept it as subconscious-and that was a possibility they seemed willing to accept-but assessing that was described as something only psychiatrists could do. Any model which would have discriminatory power for the neurologist would have to be something they could employ in their own clinical encounter. The neurologist who doubted conversion existed is instructive here: as they, uniquely, employed a psychological model in their practice, they did not see conversion anywhere. The clearest evidence that, for others, the model employed was deception, arose from those instances when they brought up cases of 'malingering' as examples of 'conversion'. They often corrected or modulated that subsequently, but their first thought, when reaching for a classic or characteristic case, was to describe deception.",
