Patients and methods: A retrospective study was adopted and 61 NAFLD patients with HBeAg-positive CHB were included as the observation group (group A), and 64 patients with simple CHB were included as the control group (group B). Results: After 12 weeks of treatment with entecavir, the total virologic response rate in group A was statistically significantly lower than that in group B (P\ue02c0.05). During weeks 24-96, the difference was not statistically significant (P\ue02e0.05). In weeks 48 and 96, there was no significant difference in the HBeAg seroconversion rates between the two groups (P\ue02e0.05). In weeks 12 and 24, there was also no significant difference in the alanine transaminase (ALT) normalization rate between the two groups (P\ue02e0.05). Then, in weeks 48 and 96, the ALT normalization rate of group A was obviously lower than that of group B (P\ue02c0.05). Group A patients were divided into group A1 (\ue023M) and group A2 (\ue02eM) according to the median value (M=2.79) of the baseline homeostatic model assessment method insulin resistance levels. In weeks 48 and 96, the ALT normalization rate of group A1 was significantly higher than that of group A2 (P\ue02c0.05). The correlation coefficient (r) of the baseline homeostatic model assessment method insulin resistance level and the severity of fatty liver in group A was 0.426 (P=0.001). Conclusion: NAFLD cannot affect the long-term total virologic response rate and HBeAg seroconversion rate in CHB patients treated with entecavir but can reduce the long-term biochemical response rate, which has a positive correlation with the severity of fatty liver and the insulin resistance index."

            "text": "After years of effective prevention and control, the incidence of patients with HBsAg has been significantly reduced; however, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is still the primary chronic liver disease that threatens people's health in the People's Republic of China. 1,2 With the improvement in living standards, the morbidity of fatty liver disease has gradually increased, and it has become the second most common chronic liver disease surpassed only by hepatitis, especially for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) due to an improper diet and lifestyle. 3 Definitions of NAFLD have been proposed using biochemical criteria and hepatic imaging, such as ultrasonography (US), computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. [4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Among these definitions, the US definition has been used most frequently in Chinese research studies, [4][5][6]11,12 and this approach has been endorsed by the Asia-Pacific regional guidelines. [7][8][9][10] NAFLD is commonly associated with type II diabetes mellitus and conditions associated with metabolic syndrome. CHB is frequently associated with hepatic steatosis. [13][14][15] Long-term studies of obese patients with the spectrum of NAFLD have shown that the progression of liver disease is predominantly observed in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. As a result, the number of patients suffering from CHB with NAFLD has increased, and the complexity of liver disease has expanded, which introduces new challenges to the clinical diagnosis and treatment. NAFLD appears to be associated with insulin resistance and represents the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Hepatic steatosis is significantly associated with entecavir treatment failure, and the metabolic factors seem to be independent of hepatic steatosis in CHB patients, therefore requiring a specific antiviral strategy for CHB patients with NAFLD. 16 Not surprisingly, patients with NAFLD are at a high risk of developing metabolic complications, which may be much higher than the risk of developing liver cirrhosis. 3 However, a recent study 17 in Turkey found that virologic replication decreases in CHB patients in the presence of NAFLD, and NAFLD had no impact on the virologic response to entecavir along with tenofovir treatment. Therefore, in the present study, we analyzed the effect of NAFLD on the response to antiviral therapy of CHB through a retrospective clinical analysis and explored the relationship between the differences in response to therapy and insulin resistance index.",

Hepatitis B virus serum markers (HBsAG, anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and anti-HBc) were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction test was used to test the serum HBV-DNA level. ALT, fasting blood glucose (FBG), concentrations of triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in serum were measured using an automatic serum biochemical assay device. Using the radioimmunity method to determine the fasting insulin level, we then estimated insulin sensitivity by homeostasis model assessment method insulin resistance (HOMA-IR = fasting serum insulin \u00d7 FBG/22.5). Standard methods were used to measure the height, waist circumference, and body mass. Body mass index = body mass (kg)/height (m). 2 All patients' liver ultrasound results were evaluated by an ultrasound doctor, and unified diagnostic reports were issued. The evaluation criteria were as follows: biochemical response to the serum ALT returned to normal; complete virologic response referred to the serum DNA-HBV load of \ue02c500 copies/mL; and HBeAg seroconversion referred to HBeAg negative and anti-HBe positive.",

PEGylated interferon treatment. Jin et al 16 investigated the effect of hepatic steatosis, a common hepatocyte change in NAFLD, on antiviral therapy in patients with CHB. They found that hepatic steatosis is significantly associated with entecavir treatment failure and that metabolic factors are independent of hepatic steatosis in CHB patients, which calls for a specified antiviral strategy in CHB patients with NAFLD. The purpose of this study was to observe and verify the effects of NAFLD on the antiviral therapy response in patients with CHB and investigate the relationship between the response differences and the insulin resistance index. In our study, the HBV-DNA clearance rate was lower in patients with NAFLD than that of the CHB group at 12 weeks, but it was equivalent at 24, 48, and 96 weeks. The results indicated that NAFLD may affect the rate of early viral response in CHB, but it would not affect the long-term treatment virologic response rate. However, this result was not consistent with that of Jin et al. 16 Considering the HBeAg seroconversion rate, we found that there were no significant differences between the two groups at 48 and 96 weeks, which suggested that NAFLD was not affecting patients' HBeAg seroconversion rate with CHB. Unfortunately, the aforementioned finding was also different from that of Jin et al. 16     According to the baseline level of the HOMA-IR median (M=2.79), the 61 patients in group A were divided into two groups (group A1, IR \ue023M, 31 patients and group A2, IR \ue02eM, 30 patients).

The results we observed suggested that NAFLD did not affect the early biochemical response rate in CHB patients, which might be due to the early use of drugs to protect the liver and reduce enzymes. However, it might affect the long-term biochemical response rate, which is consistent with the results of related studies. 16 According to the demographic information and baseline of the two groups, it was demonstrated that the occurrence of NAFLD was not related to viral factors and ALT levels, while the disorder of the metabolism and insulin resistance might play an important role. Further studies found that the level of insulin resistance was positively correlated with the severity of the fatty liver in group A (r=0.426, P=0.001). The subgroup analysis of group A indicated that the baseline levels of HOMA-IR and the biochemical responses were negatively correlated, which was more apparent when treatment period was longer.",
