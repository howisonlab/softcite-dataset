            "text": "We developed a novel PCR-based pre-amplification (PreAmp) technology that can increase the abundance of over 350 target genes one million-fold. To assess potential bias introduced by PreAmp we utilized ERCC RNA reference standards, a model system that quantifies measurement error in RNA analysis. We assessed three types of bias: amplification bias, dynamic range bias and fold-change bias. We show that our PreAmp workflow introduces only minimal amplification and fold-change bias under stringent conditions. We do detect dynamic range bias if a target gene is highly abundant and PreAmp occurred for 16 or more PCR cycles; however, this type of bias is easily correctable. To assess PreAmp bias in a gene expression profiling experiment, we analyzed a panel of genes that are regulated during differentiation using the NTera2 stem cell model system. We find that results generated using PreAmp are similar to results obtained using standard qPCR (without the pre-amplification step). Importantly, PreAmp maintains patterns of gene expression changes across samples; the same biological insights would be derived from a PreAmp experiment as with a standard gene expression profiling experiment. We conclude that our PreAmp technology can facilitate analysis of extremely limited samples in gene expression quantification experiments.",

PreAmp can be achieved through whole transcriptome amplification [1] or at the level of targeted gene panels using PCR-based methodology [2,3]. However, there is a legitimate concern that PreAmp might change a sample to an extent that results generated from it are misleading or inaccurate. Better understanding of the limitations of a PreAmp-based workflow is necessary to ensure the reliability of research results.",

The ERCC standards are mixtures of up to 96 synthetic RNAs that are spiked into an RNA sample and processed and quantified along with the natural RNAs. The amount of each ERCC RNA in a mixture is precisely defined; the performance of an RNA quantification workflow/platform is determined by comparing the measured amount with the actual, defined amount of each ERCC control RNA. In addition, by spiking two sets of ERCC standards (with defined ratios of each ERCC target) into two different biological samples, the accuracy in quantifying gene expression differences between samples can be determined. ERCC standards have been used to assess qPCR, digital PCR, microfluidic qPCR, microarray and RNAseq platforms for their precision, accuracy and detection limits in RNA quantification [6][7][8][9][10].",

Unless both challenges are addressed in a PreAmp reagent, the probability of having biased pre-amplification will be high.

We find that fold-change measurement bias appears similar when comparing the no PreAmp, 88-plex PreAmp and 355-plex PreAmp results. In Fig. 1D we show the measurement error in fold-change results; no measurement error would have a Cq value of 0, a Cq value of 1 indicates a measurement error of 100%. We observe that measurement error increases as the amount of ERCC target RNA decreases. This finding is expected and is consistent with stochastic partitioning of a small number of RNA molecules in the qPCR reactions. We then quantified the fold-change measurement error associated with RNA abundance ranges ( Table 1). We find that for RNAs with moderate to high abundance (Cq < 30) fold-change measurement error is, on average, only about 0.1Cq representing 7% error. For low abundance RNAs (Cq between 30 and 32.5) measurement error averages 20%, for trace RNAs (Cq > 32.5) 75% average measurement error is observed. Importantly, a test of statistical equivalence indicates that PreAmp (88-plex or 355-plex) has only a slight effect on fold-change measurement error relative to the no PreAmp samples (only the trace RNAs in the 88-plex PreAmp sample has a p-Value above the 0.05 threshold that indicates a PreAmp bias, the p-value is 0.0515). These findings are consistent with a previous report [6] and demonstrates that our PreAmp workflow only has low fold-change bias when analyzing trace expression target genes.",

However, the ERCC model system is based on spike-in of in-vitro transcribed RNAs, not natural RNA transcripts. To determine if the PreAmp workflow can accurately quantify gene expression changes of natural targets, we analyzed RNA samples purified from NT2 cells, an established model system of human stem cell behavior. When treated with retinoic acid (RA), NT2 cells differentiate into neurons [12,13]; during differentiation the expression of stem cell-specific biomarkers decrease while the expression of neuron-specific biomarkers increase [14][15][16][17]. To identify genes regulated during differentiation we applied the fold-change limits-of-detection criteria established in the previous section (Table 1) to 267 genes involved in cell maintenance, cell fate and adaptation. We identified 34 regulated genes, which include well known stem cell biomarkers such as NANOG and neural cell biomarkers such as NEUROD1 ( Table 2). Most of these genes were previously characterized to be involved in NT2 differentiation [14][15][16][17], which is confirmatory of our approach.",

We show data for several representative regulated target genes, gene transcript levels are expressed as \"RNA copies per cell\" after normalizing with TBP and assuming that there are 10 TBP copies per cell [18]; this method of normalization provides information on the relative level of target gene expression as well as fold-change of RNA abundance (Fig. 2). Data presented in Supplemental Fig. 1 shows that TBP expression is relatively stable over the time course of RA exposure changing less than 0.5Cq (25%), this justifies its use as a normalization gene. The assumption that there are 10 TBP copies per cell does not affect fold-change results; it is used because it provides a relative estimate of target gene levels in a biologically relevant context.",

However, microfluidicbased qPCR instruments have a nanoliter scale interrogation volume and often require up to 20 PreAmp cycles to achieve single copy detection [19]. To assess bias associated with PreAmp cycle number we used the ERCC controls which have wide range of RNA abundance [10]. We diluted the ExFold mixtures such that all targets should be present in a PreAmp reaction (2.5 copies to 5.6 million copies). We then pre-amplified the samples using standard (88-plex) and high multiplex (355-plex) conditions for 10-20 PreAmp cycles; this reflects a target amplification range of 10 3 -10 6 -fold. The amount of ERCC target detected, as a function of RNA abundance, is shown in Fig. 4A. We find that all ERCC targets can be detected in the no PreAmp sample and in the samples processed for 14 PreAmp cycles. This implies that a moderate number of PreAmp cycles will not bias the 6-log dynamic range of target detection. However, for samples that underwent 20 PreAmp cycles, quantification of targets in the 1 million copy range, corresponding to a Cq value less than 5, are of unreliable value (see Fig. 4C).",

Fig. 4B shows the qPCR traces for the moderate abundance target, ERCC-00144, which is present at \u223c5,500 copies in the PreAmp reaction. We find that amplification efficiency, with respect to cycle number, is linear and close to 100%. However, for the high abundance target ERCC-00074, which is present at over 2.8 million copies in the PreAmp reaction, high numbers of PreAmp cycles results in poor target quantification, thus exhibiting dynamic range bias (Fig. 4C). We conclude that high numbers of PreAmp cycles could bias results for very highly expressed genes and, therefore, recommend using the fewest number of PreAmp cycles required to achieve robust single copy target gene detection. Supplementary Table 2 lists the amplification efficiency and dynamic range bias of all ERCC targets; the results demonstrate that our PreAmp workflow supports quantitative target gene amplification up to 1 million-fold under both standard and high multiplex conditions.",

In practice, the theoretical target gene amount can be estimated from the amount of target detected in the nonamplified cDNA sample and the number of PreAmp cycles (see Section 2). To assess amplification bias, we compared target gene levels in cDNA samples before and after 14 PreAmp cycles. For each target gene we calculated the amplification bias introduced by PreAmp and plotted it against the level of target gene expres-  5). We considered gene targets that have a Cq \u2265 40 in the original sample to be not expressed and excluded them from analysis. We observe that for 319 (91%) of the 346 expressed gene targets, PreAmp did not change the expression level by more than 1.0Cq.",

Our standard, no PreAmp gene expression profiling workflow can quantify the entire 6-log dynamic range of the ERCC controls. Pre-amplification for up to 14 PCR cycles can also accurately quantify the entire ERCC assay set and, thus, does not introduce dynamic range bias. However, in instances of high target gene expression coupled with a high number of PreAmp cycles (e.g. 20 cycles) target gene quantification may be compromised. Dynamic range bias was previously reported in a microfluidic-based qPCR study and is quite consistent with our findings [3]; a high number of PreAmp cycles biased the quantification of high abundance target genes. We believe that dynamic range bias will not be an issue in standard qPCR experiments. Such bias is apparent in the qPCR traces (Fig. 4C), and can be alleviated through sample dilution or use of fewer PreAmp cycles. For applications that require high levels of PreAmp, such as microfluidic-based qPCR, our conclusions may not apply. More work is necessary to better quantify the various types of bias associated with high PCR cycle PreAmp.",
