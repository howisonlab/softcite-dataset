Methods: We developed 6 mice models: OVA-challenged lean mice with and without rosiglitazone; obese mice with and without rosiglitazone; and OVA-challenged obese mice with and without rosiglitazone. We performed real-time polymerase chain reaction for leptin, leptin receptor, adiponectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, PPAR-\u03b1 and PPAR-\u03b3 from the lung tissue and determined the cell counts and cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Results: Mice with OVA challenge showed airway hyperresponsiveness. The lung mRNA levels of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR-\u03b3 increased significantly in obese mice with OVA challenge compared to that in other types of mice and decreased after rosiglitazone administeration. Leptin and leptin receptor expression increased in obese mice with and without OVA challenge and decreased following rosiglitazone treatment. Adiponectin mRNA level increased in lean mice with OVA challenge. Lung VEGF, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2 mRNA levels increased in obese mice with and without OVA challenge compared to that in the control mice. However, rosiglitazone reduced only TGF-\u03b2 expression in obese mice, and even augmented VEGF expression in all types of mice. Rosiglitazone treatment did not reduce airway responsiveness, but increased neutrophils and macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Conclusion: PPAR-\u03b1 and PPAR-\u03b3 expressions were upregulated in the lung tissue of OVA-challenged obese mice however, rosiglitazone treatment did not downregulate airway inflammation in these mice.",

In mature adipocytes, PPAR \u03b3 interacts with several coactivators with chromatin modifying activities, repress and enhance its transcriptional activity 17) . Although PPAR \u03b3 and PPAR\u03b1 lung expressions didn't increase significantly in mice with OVA challenge and with obesity, we found a tendency of in crease. As a result, rosiglitazone administration decreased the lung PPAR \u03b3 and PPAR\u03b1 mRNA levels in mice with OVA challenge. We can figure out the possibility of significance with the increase of study subjects in the future study. The direct mechanism for the relationship between obesity and asthma has not been established yet. Leptin is a hormone secreted preferentially by adipose tissue, exerting pleiotropic effects such as body weight homeostasis, reproduction and hematopoiesis 18) . Leptin acts as a proinflammatory cytokine, and its blood level is elevated in obese people. Leptin receptor is expressed in airway smooth muscle 19) , and leptin promoted VEGF release by human airway smooth muscle cells 20) . In this study, leptin as well as leptin receptor demonstrated increased mRNA levels in obese mice with and without OVA challenge, which decreased with rosiglitazone. However, they didn't show significant increase in mice with OVA challenge compared to control mice, and there was no difference in the expression of leptin and leptin receptor between obese mice with and without OVA challenge. Rosiglitazone administration to the preadipocytes isolated from obese mice, resulted in the diffe rentiation into mature adipo cytes. The inhibitory effect of leptin on rosiglitazone induced adipocyte differentiation was also accompanied by the decreased expression of adipogenic transcription factors. Rosiglitazone was decreased in the presence of leptin 18) . Leptin may be related to obesity itself, not asthma, and may not be a contributing factor for poorly controlled asthma in obese asthmatics. There has been no data onthe effect of rosiglitazone on leptin regulation in asthma. Contrary to our study, another study demonstrated rosiglitazone increased leptin levels in obese mice, while decreased leptin levels in lean mice 3) . However, they tried short Fig. 5.

In this study, lung expression of adiponectin increased significantly in mice with OVA challenge, and decreased in obese mice. However, there was no significant difference in obese mice with OVA challenge compared to control mice. Until now, there has been no data which investi gated the lung expression of adiponectin in obese mice with OVA challenge.

We found augmented lung expression of VEGF, TNF\u03b1, and TGF\u03b2 in both obese mice with and without OVA challenge, and VEGF mRNA level also increased in lean mice with OVA challenge. However, there was no synergistic increase of cytokine expressions in obese mice with OVA challenge compared to lean mice with OVA challenge or obese mice. In this study, rosiglitazone enhanced lung VEGF mRNA level in all types of mice, and TNF\u03b1 mRNA level in obese mice with OVA chal lenge. This is supported by another study with murine model with chronic asthma, which shows increased VEGF and TGF\u03b2 levels in BAL fluid of ciglitazonetreated asthma mice 24) . However, other studies showed PPAR agonists decreased serum VEGF levels and lung expression of TGF\u03b2 7,25) , and reduced expression of TNF\u03b1 in adipocytes ofobese mice treated with the PPAR \u03b3 agonist troglitazone 26) . We can assume VEGF, TNF\u03b1, and TGF\u03b2 are not major contributing cytokines regulated by rosiglitazone in obese asthmatics. There has been no data on the effect of rosiglitazone on cytokine expressions in obese asthmatics.",
