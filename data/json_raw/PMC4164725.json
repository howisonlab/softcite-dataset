            "text": "Background/Aims: Smoking is widely acknowledged as the single most important risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the risk of COPD in nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the association of secondhand smoke exposure with COPD prevalence in nonsmokers who reported never smoking. Methods: This study was based on data obtained from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) conducted from 2008 to 2010. Using nationwide stratified random sampling, 8,596 participants aged \u2265 40 years of age with available spirometry results were recruited. After selecting participants who never smoked, the duration of exposure to secondhand smoke was assessed based on the KNHANES questionnaire. Results: The prevalence of COPD was 6.67% in participants who never smoked. We divided the participants who had never smoked into those with or without exposure to secondhand smoke. The group exposed to secondhand smoke was younger with less history of asthma and tuberculosis, higher income, and higher educational status. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined that secondhand smoke did not increase the prevalence of COPD. Conclusions: There was no significant difference in the prevalence of COPD between participants who had never smoked with or without exposure to secondhand smoke in our study. Thus, secondhand smoke may not be an important risk factor for the development of COPD in patients who have never smoked."

            "text": "Secondhand smoke is known to increase the incidence of heart disease, lung cancer, and asthma. It also causes respiratory symptoms such as cough and phlegm [10,11]. In our study, we investigated the relationship between secondhand smoke exposure and COPD in Koreans who had never smoked and the epidemiological differences between groups that were or were not exposed to secondhand smoke. Most participants \u2265 40 years of age who had never smoked were female, which reflects the lifestyle of the Korean population; the male lifetime smoking rate is ~90%. Considering that smoking is the single most important COPD risk factor, the low prevalence of COPD in subjects exposed to secondhand smoke was unexpected. These results may be attributable to the characteristics of patients not exposed to secondhand smoke, who were generally older had had a higher rate of a history of asthma and tuberculosis, lower income, and lower education status. Moreover, previous studies have reported that females are more susceptible to COPD; a greater number of female participants in our study population were not exposed to secondhand smoke. Urine cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine used as an indicator of secondhand smoke exposure that increases over time following exposure [12]. In our study, urine cotinine levels were correlated with secondhand smoke exposure, confirming the reliability of our results. However, there was no significant association between secondhand smoke exposure and spirometry results. Furthermore, we found no significant association between secondhand smoke and COPD prevalence by multivariate analysis. Cigarette smoke contains approximately 4,000 toxic substances, such as oxidative gas, heavy metals, cya- nide, and at least 50 carcinogens [12]. These hazardous substances are emitted into the air in exhaled smoke [13]. Several previous studies have reported an association between COPD with exposure to passive smoking during childhood and respiratory symptoms in adulthood [14]. Moreover, passive smoking was associated with poorer health status and a greater risk of COPD exacerbation [15]. A few studies have contradicted the correlation between secondhand smoke exposure and COPD prevalence. For example, analysis of approximately 6,000 Chinese subjects who had never smoked showed that passive smoking increased the risk of COPD and respiratory symptoms [16]. In contrast, a health survey performed in England indicated that increased passive smoking exposure was independently associated with an increased risk of COPD in the general population, but did not increase the risk of COPD in those that had never smoked [17].",

            "text": "Our study had several limitations. First, it was of a cross-sectional design so we are unable to demonstrate a causal relationship between secondhand smoke and COPD. However, the strength of this study was the systematic analysis of the domestic status of those partici-pants who had never smoked that were exposed to secondhand smoke using a nationwide Korean database. Second, we investigated the presence of secondhand smoke exposure using questionnaires only. We accounted for the possibility of recall bias due to the characteristics of this cross-sectional survey by assessing the urine cotinine level, thereby increasing the reliability of the results. However, it is important to note that the urine cotinine level reflects nicotine absorption for 2 to 3 days only and cannot be used to assess long-term exposure. Third, we were unable to obtain information on the duration of exposure to secondhand smoke due to the simplicity of the survey questions. Chronic diseases such as COPD have been associated with continuous and long-term exposure to risk factors; therefore, the duration and total amount of exposure are important variables. If subjects had been asked more specific questions regarding their recent exposure, the answers would likely focus on more recent exposures that would be reflected in the survey and urine cotinine level. Fourth, we identified significant differences in age, gender, previous diagnosis of asthma or tuberculosis, income, and education status based on the presence or  absence of secondhand smoke exposure in those participants who had never smoked. We did not investigate the effect of each variable on the risk of COPD in those participants who never smoked, although these variables are known COPD risk factors in never smokers [3]. Further investigation of the correlation between those variables and the risk of COPD would yield more accurate information regarding the characteristics of COPD in nonsmokers. In summary, COPD prevalence was higher in a Korean population \u2265 40 years of age without secondhand smoke exposure; however, this might reflect epidemiological differences between the two groups rather than effects of secondhand smoke. A prospective large cohort study should be performed to confirm the impact of secondhand smoke on the prevalence of COPD among those that have never smoked.",
