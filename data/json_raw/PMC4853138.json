            "text": "Purpose: Currently, serum biomarkers that are sufficiently sensitive and specific for early detection and risk classification of gastric adenocarcinomas are not known. In this study, ten serum markers were assessed using the Luminex system and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the diagnosis of gastric cancer and analysis of the relation between prognosis and metastases. Patients and methods: A training set consisting of 228 gastric adenocarcinoma and 190 control samples was examined. A Luminex multiplex panel with nine biomarkers, consisting of three proteins discovered through our previous studies and six proteins previously reported to be cancer-associated, was constructed. One additional biomarker was detected using a commercial kit containing EDTA. Logistic regression, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to identify the panel of discriminatory biomarkers in the training set. After selecting five proteins as candidate biomarkers, multivariate classification analyses were used to identify algorithms for diagnostic biomarker combinations. These algorithms were independently validated using a set of 57 gastric adenocarcinoma and 48 control samples. Results: Serum pepsinogen I, serum pepsinogen II, A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 8 (ADAM8), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and serum IgG to Helicobacter pylori were selected as classifiers in the three algorithms. These algorithms differentiated between the majority of gastric adenocarcinoma and control serum samples in the training/test set with high accuracy (RF 79.0%, SVM 83.8%, logistic regression 76.2%). These algorithms also differentiated the samples in the validation set (accuracy: RF 82.5%, SVM 86.1%, logistic regression 78.7%). Conclusion: A panel of combinatorial biomarkers comprising VEGF, ADAM8, IgG to H. pylori, serum pepsinogen I, and pepsinogen II were developed. The use of biomarkers is a less invasive method for the diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma. They may supplement clinical gastroscopic evaluation of symptomatic gastric cancer patients and enhance the diagnostic accuracy.",

            "text": "Gastric adenocarcinoma accounts for 40% of all new gastric cancer cases worldwide. It is the fifth most common cancer globally and the third most common cause of cancerrelated deaths (estimated 723,000 deaths, 8.8% of the total in 2012), 1 mainly because of a late diagnosis. The disease is particularly prevalent in Far Eastern countries. Gastric adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy in the People's Republic of China, and was the second leading cause of death by malignancy (14.33%) in 2012. 2 Gastric cancer patients have considerably lower survival rates than those with other gastroenterological tract cancers, except for cancer of the esophagus. Five-year survival rates of patients with localized disease (stages I, II, N0) (63.2%) decreased to 28.4% after the cancer spread to regional lymph nodes (stages II, III, N1-N3), and to 3.9% following the detection of distant metastases (stage IV). 3 An early diagnosis coupled with good treatment strategy for gastric cancer can significantly improve the survival rates. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is the most reliable method for diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma. It is used broadly in gastroscopy in the People's Republic of China, South Korea, and Japan because of the high incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma in these countries. South Korea and Japan are the only two countries that provide a government-sponsored screening program for gastric cancer. These resulted in low mortalityto-incidence ratio (0.43 in Japan, 0.35 in South Korea), indicating the benefits of population-based screening in highprevalence regions. 1 The screening programs run in these countries include gastroscopy and serology tests. However, the feasibility and effectiveness of gastroscopy is questionable for the countries with low incidence rates for gastric cancers.",

In past decades, studies have revealed several serum biomarkers for gastric cancer which comprise carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, and CA 72-4, among others. However, the sensitivity of these serum biomarkers used during diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma (20%-30%) is lower as compared to other cancers. [4][5][6] Resent proteomic-based research identified several significantly more selective and specific biomarkers. 7 Also, miRNAs are emerging as a new potentially important tool in diagnostics of gastric cancer. 8 These new approaches, however, often require specific technique and expensive instrumentation and cannot be used for routine screening tests.",

Control samples (n=238) were collected from attendees of the health check-up program from the same hospital between 2008 and 2010. Patients from the control group had no history of cancer. All participants underwent: 1) routine medical history and physical examination; 2) routine blood and Helicobacter pylori IgG tests; 3) chest X-ray; 4) abdominal ultrasound investigation or computed tomography scan; 5) gastroduodenoscopy; and 6) mammography in women. Two hundred and thirty-eight control samples without inflammatory conditions, or confirmed or suspected cancer that needed medical treatment, were included. All blood samples were collected before any medical treatment in the early morning. Peripheral blood was collected and stored in SST II tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at room temperature for 1 hour, then centrifuged at 3,000\u00d7 g for 5 minutes. Supernatants were collected, separated in aliquots, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. All participants signed an informed consent form.

It is an antibody-based microarray, with high sensitivity and high throughput advantage, which has been used extensively in clinical diagnosis and research work. Among the nine target proteins ( Table 3) chosen for this project, COX2, ADAM8, and beta-catenin were identified in our previous studies. 10,11 There was difference in the expression of beta-catenin between the gastric cancer tissue and normal gastric mucosa tissue. COX2 and ADAM8 were higher in the gastric cancer tissues with lymph node metastases than in those without metastasis. Serum pepsinogen I (PGI) and PGI/PGII ratios in the serum or plasma are indicators of atrophic gastritis, which is linked to elevated risk of gastric cancer. [12][13][14][15] H. pylori and gastric atrophy have both been identified as etiological factors for gastric cancer. H. pylori was declared as a class I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1994. 16 Epidemiological surveys support a positive association between H. pylori infection and the development of gastric cancer. [17][18][19] In this study, all patients and health controls had been tested for H. pylori IgG with ELISA kit (Biohit ELISA kit; Biohit, Helsinki, Finland). Intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and hemoglobin were also associated with gastric cancer development and metastasis in previous studies. [20][21][22][23][24][25][26] All antibodies have been validated in ELISA and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antigen protein has been validated for ELISA too. We developed all kits for Luminex according to The Luminex Cookbook. 27 All nine protein kits were divided into a 5-plex panel and two 2-plex panels with different dilution rates for each patients' samples. All samples were randomly divided into different plates to perform the Luminex test. The random number allocation and grouping was done using STATA 12 software.",

[31][32][33] However, to date, there is no single known biomarker unique for diagnosis of gastric cancer. The traditional biomarkers such as carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, CA 12-5, and CA 7-24 are more sensitive in the diagnostics of other gastroenterological cancers rather than for gastric cancer. [4][5][6] For this reason, they were excluded from this study. Instead, we tried to test other proteins that are known to be associated with tumorigenesis and development of gastric cancer. We used three algorithms to combine five biomarkers (IgG to H. pylori, ADAM8, PGI, PGII, and VEGF) in a panel cross-validated in a training group of 418 samples and a test group of 105 samples. SVM and RF resulted in higher accuracy and sensitivity compared to the logistic regression method. For SVM, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the test group were 86.1%, 88.6%, and 83.2%, respectively. Both PGI and PGII are being used in the gastric cancer screening in the countries with high incidence of this disease. H. pylori infection is known to be a major cause of peptic ulcer development and, eventually, gastric cancer development in Asian countries. The infection rate and the carrier rate are higher in Asian populations than elsewhere in the world. With the H. pylori infection, gastric mucosa cells can produce more COX2, and beta-catenin is known to be involved in this process. In turn, COX2 and beta-catenin direct the production of VEGF. We detected significant correlation between protein levels of beta-catenin, COX2, and VEGF in our analysis. Moreover, VEGF and ADAM8 were associated with tumor metastases. Thus, the five selected biomarkers have a significant role to play during gastric carcinogenesis. In this study, SVM algorithm demonstrated the best performance. It had the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity as compared to RF and logistic regression analysis. The five selected biomarkers were not associated with the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. In addition, the overall     sensitivity was sustained regardless of TNM stage and tumor size. Although none of the individual markers showed sufficient diagnostic power independently, the biomarker panel identified in this study performed well. SVM algorithm demonstrated the best performance in this study. The concentrations of proteins that we identified in this study are much higher than the concentrations of other cytokines and low level biomarkers that are usually detected with mass spectroscopy in serum samples. Therefore, the panel of biomarkers may have clinical applications and can be particularly useful for the preliminary diagnostics in patients with reported symptoms.",
