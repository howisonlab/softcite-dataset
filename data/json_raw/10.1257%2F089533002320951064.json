The essay is critical toward the involvement of commercial publishers, including Elsevier, in economics publishing. The essay is provocative, but it ignores major elements of the existing publishing situation and leads to conclusions that are highly questionable. Library Prices The essay provides a critical comparison on the basis of quoted library prices for print subscriptions alone. However, it does not acknowledge the availability of sophisticated electronic versions of the Elsevier journals. ScienceDirect (at \u0357http:// www.sciencedirect.com\u0358), the world's largest electronic journal publishing platform for academic research, is not referred to at all. Depending upon the license, ScienceDirect can provide participating universities/consortia with access to more than 1,500 journals, of which are over 140 titles in economics, finance, management and business. Basic electronic access to the Elsevier journals is offered through the ScienceDirect web-editions at no additional cost to the print subscription price. This includes access to a rolling 12 months of full text articles from the subscribed journals in both .pdf and HTML formats. ScienceDirect can also include a range of additional contents and services. For example, it includes a searchable database of more than 2 million scientific research articles going back to 1995. For quick scanning, there is a \"summary plus\" of each article: abstract, outline, graphics and linked references. Each article is published in .pdf and HTML formats, enabling searching through references and linking to the full text of the cited articles in ScienceDirect and to those of participating publishers within CrossRef.

Given these figures and our own calculation of the AEA first copy cost as $281 per page, Bergstrom's choice of $100 per page as an \"average\" for first copy costs appears far too low, which means that his estimates of profits to be earned from journal publication are far too high.",

If library spending continues to increase at a much slower pace than R&D budgets (which drive the volume of articles produced), tensions will continue to exist. It can be alleviated by new business models only.

With respect to the \"price-gouging\" by commercial journals, I agree with Theodore C.

Although interlibrary loan may be slower than recovering articles from actual journals in the library, downloading them from the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) on a personal or library computer does save the effort and expense of manual photocopying. As the researcher becomes more experienced with search engines and downloading, he or she becomes attuned to the idea of electronic publishing.",

I am able to subscribe, at a reasonable price, to several of the commercial journals that Bergstrom lists because I am a member of their sponsoring societies. Those publishers took a chance on these journals when their specialized areas seemed more marginal than they turned out to be. In fact, over the years that I have subscribed to them, these journals have expanded, one of them from four to six issues per year, the other from four to twelve issues per year, which says something about the service they are providing in their subfields.",

I agree with Professor Bergstrom that \"price gouging\" publishers who \"have been draining huge amounts of money from university budgets\" need to be restrained. Economists should support the strategic cancellations by their library of those expensive journals that others in the OCLC consortium prefer to keep. For those who take pride in seeing their articles displayed in the libraries they use, and who feel like freeloaders when publishers of their articles write them personal letters urging them to pressure their libraries to subscribe, this adversarial strategy will be painful.

But as hard copies of the journals become more rare and their contents less accessible, economists will be increasingly attracted to the \"innovative and reasonably priced new electronic economics journals\" that Professor Bergstrom heralds. As electronically published articles become accessible via the search engines and are found to download as easily as conventionally printed articles, economists who take pleasure in citing relevant articles and who measure their own effectiveness by the number of times their papers are cited will become more open to publishing in and citing from the new electronic journals. Instead of trying to punish the commercial journals, as Professor Bergstrom urges, economists should be moved by his rhetoric to get past their former biases in favor of bound volumes in library stacks and respond to calls, that some of us have regrettably ignored, to participate in that next revolution in scholarly publishing. The commercial journals helped pave the way for that revolution and deserve credit for that, but they can only play a small part in what the future has to offer.",

Moreover, the availability of desk-top access through university site licenses is likely to reduce publishers' revenue from individual subscriptions. Since nonprofit journals price approximately at their average cost, we can get a rough estimate of the cost of going on-line by looking at library subscription prices of nonprofit journals before and after the introduction of electronic access. All of the top-cited nonprofit journals have introduced on-line access since 1998. The average per-page price of the top-cited nonprofit economics journals (measured in 2002 dollars) rose from $0.10 in 1998 to about $0.12 in 2002. Thus, for the nonprofit journals, a price increase of about 2 cents per page has sufficed to pay the costs of going on-line. During the same time period, the top-cited commercial journals increased their prices by an average of about 10 cents per page, from $0.79 to $0.89. Mr. Dirkmaat points out that Elsevier now offers \"package deals\" to libraries. By paying some multiple of its current total expenditure on Elsevier journals, a library can subscribe electronically to Elsevier journals that it doesn't currently hold. The net price of these additional journals can be substantially lower than their list price. With electronic site licenses, commercial publishers, who traditionally charged a uniform institutional price for paper editions, have found ways to price discriminate between large and small universities by offering negotiated group rates to consortia of smaller libraries. There is reason to be pleased that price discrimination will extend access to work published in Elsevier journals beyond the largest and richest universities. On the other hand, once commercial journals are able to price discriminate, they can relax a significant constraint on prices charged to large universities. Price discrimination enables them to raise prices to the largest universities without fearing that they will lose the subscriptions of the middle-sized. Carl Bergstrom and I (Bergstrom and Bergstrom, 2001) present a theoretical case that the introduction of university site licenses by profit-maximizing publishers is likely to reduce rather than increase the consumers' surplus of the academic community.",

            "text": "Mr. Dirkmaat suggests that my data on the average price of personal subscriptions is \"misleading with respect to the Elsevier Science Journals, which make up seven of the top ten commercial journals on Bergstrom's list.\" (Actually, with recent acquisitions, all ten journals on this list are published by Elsevier. The Journal of Economic Theory and Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, formerly published by Academic Press, now belong to Elsevier, as does World Development, formerly published by Pergamon.) But even when we account for discounts to members of professional societies, we see from Tables 3 and 4 that, on average, personal subscriptions to the top Elsevier journals are more than twice as expensive as for the top nonprofit journals. Even more striking is the fact that all of the leading nonprofit journals bundle electronic access with print subscriptions at little or no extra charge, while only one commercial journal offers electronic access to individuals. 2 In addition to providing free online access to individual subscribers, all but one of the nonprofit journals give them access to the complete backlist of previous volumes (via JSTOR) at little or no extra charge. None of the commercial journals includes electronic access to old volumes with private subscriptions. Although it does not sell on-line subscriptions to individuals, Elsevier does allow  nonsubscribers to view web-based articles on a \"pay-per-view\" basis at a price of $30 per article. Mr. Dirkmaat asks us to notice that members of the European Economic Association can receive the European Economic Review at reduced rates. I am surprised that he brings this to our attention. The EER has been the official journal of the EEA, but this relationship is about to end. Because of discontent with Elsevier's pricing policies, the EEA Council voted unanimously to terminate its agreement with Elsevier with effect from January 1, 2003. I expect that the EEA will demonstrate over the next few months that it is possible to break free from an exploitative publishing arrangement and to offer an improved and reasonably priced alternative. Other professional societies whose journals have been captured by commercial publishers will find this a useful lesson.",

            "text": "Mr. Dirkmaat is concerned that my article doesn't explain the basis of my estimate of $100 per page for first copy costs of journal articles. Fair enough. Here is where it comes from. Tenopir and King (2000, pp. 256 -259) offer detailed estimates of first copy costs for journal articles. Their estimate (p. 259) is $130 per page (which includes $60 per page for \"special graphics,\" a figure that seemed to me high for economics papers). By pestering several economics journal editors and their staffs, I obtained rough breakdowns of production costs for a few journals and thus estimated marginal, per subscriber costs. For other journals, I had data on total costs and the number of subscriptions sold. With this data, I made estimates of first copy costs for about 20 journals. While my estimates varied quite widely across journals, the median was close to $100.",

            "text": "Dirkmaat attempts his own estimate of first copy costs, using data from the May 2001 AER, which reports total publication costs for each of the three AEA journals. Based on the assumption that marginal costs are $0.02 per page per subscriber, he estimates that the average first copy cost per page is $281. I applaud Dirkmaat's efforts to argue from actual data. His method is reasonable in principle, but (understandably for someone not familiar with AEA publications) he did not realize that the publication expenses reported for the Journal of Economic Literature also include the cost of producing EconLit, an electronic bibliography of economic literature. EconLit is produced in a separate office from the office that handles the JEL articles and book reviews. EconLit is marketed separately from the AEA journals and maintains separate accounts. The staff of the JEL provided me with a breakdown of expenditures between the two offices. Of the $1.57 million reported as JEL expenses, only about $700,000 are attributable to the articles and book reviews. When we apply Dirkmaat's method, but exclude the EconLit costs, the resulting estimate of average first copy costs for the three AEA journals is $84 per page. 3 Since the May issue of the AER reports total publication expenses separately for each of the three journals, it is possible to estimate their costs separately. If we assume marginal costs of $0.02 per page, the estimated per page first copy costs are $55 for the AER, $154 for the JEP and $134 for the JEL (with EconLit costs excluded). However, because circulation of the AEA journals is so large, these estimates are highly sensitive to the assumption made about marginal cost per page. For example, if it is assumed that marginal costs are $0.015 per page instead of $0.02, the estimated first copy cost for the AER is $177 per page, and the average for the three journals is $222. Whether first copy costs are $100 or $200 per page, it appears that the leading commercial journals are priced far above average cost and enjoy very large profits at the expense of the academic community. (Of course, I cannot disprove the alternative explanation that large commercial publishers operate much less efficiently than the nonprofits and thus have higher first copy costs and lower profits than my calculations suggest.) Consider a journal with 1,700 pages (the average number of pages in the journals in Table 2) and 850 institutional subscribers, with first copy costs of c per page and marginal costs of $0.02 per page per subscriber. Its average cost per subscriber will be given by  Table 2 is $1500 per subscriber. At this price, the journal's profits per subscriber are $1266 with the low-cost estimate and $1066 with the high estimate.",

The new journals served an important purpose, and even in their early years, their publishers seem to have been handsomely rewarded with profits. In 1985, the average institutional price of the commercial journals listed in Table 2 was about $0.30 per page (measured in 2002 dollars). There is good evidence that this price was well above average cost. Four well-known nonprofit specialty economics journals were founded at roughly the same time as the \"new\" commercial journals: the Journal of Labor Economics, Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, Journal of Human Resources and the Journal of Law and Economics. Institutional subscription prices for these four nonprofit journals ranged from $0.09 to $0.12 per page (in 2002 dollars), only about one-third the price of the new commercial journals. Since 1985, the large commercial publishers have not been content with prices merely three times those of included in our calculation of printing and distribution costs. Details of the calculation are available from the author. comparable nonprofit journals. They have managed to raise their prices per page to almost six times the prices of nonprofit journals. Just how far should our gratitude extend?",

Several recent developments suggest that electronic technology is likely to help us break out of this bad equilibrium and to distribute and certify our research papers without monopolistic exploitation. In addition to the European Economics Association's departure from the Elsevier fold, three distinct electronic journals projects have made encouraging headway. Two of these projects got underway in 2001. These are Economic Bulletin, which is available on-line for free and is an effective substitute for Elsevier's pricey Economic Letters, and the Berkeley Electronic Press series of journals in theoretical economics, macroeconomics and economic analysis and politics. The Electronic Society for Social Scientists (ELSSS), which plans to introduce a series of lowpriced, high-quality, technologically advanced economics journals, has recently acquired the necessary working capital for initiating the first of this series, the Review of Economic Theory, and is currently assembling an editorial board. These developments suggest that we are well on our way to fulfilling Professor Kohn's prophecy that although the commercial journals \"helped pave the way for a revolution in scholarly publishing, they can only play a small part in what the future has to offer.\" Theodore C.
