Methods Eighteen patients with SCI within 3 months and 10 healthy adults participated. We applied the ARFI technique to measure SWV of gastrocnemius muscle (GCM) and long head of biceps femoris muscle. Spasticity of ankle and knee joint was assessed by original Ashworth Scale. Results Ten patients with SCI had spasticity. Patients with spasticity had significantly faster SWV for GCM and biceps femoris muscle than those without spasticity (Mann-Whitney U test, p=0.007 and p=0.008) and normal control (p=0.011 and p=0.037, respectively). The SWV values of GCM correlated with the ankle spasticity (Spearman rank teat, p=0.026). There was significant correlation between the SWV values for long head of biceps femoris muscle and knee spasticity (Spearman rank teat, p=0.022). Conclusion ARFI demonstrated a difference in muscle stiffness in the GCM between patients with spastic SCI and those without spasticity. This finding suggested that stiffness of muscles increased in spastic lower extremity of early SCI patients. ARFI imaging is a valuable tool for noninvasive assessment of the stiffness of the spastic muscle and has the potential to identify pathomechanical changes of the tissue associated with SCI.",

            "text": "Spasticity is generally conceptualized as a symptom of the upper motor neuron lesion. It is characterized by an exaggeration of the stretch reflex, spasms and resistance to passive movement across a joint, secondary to the hyperexcitability of spinal reflexes [1][2][3][4][5][6]. A complete loss of descending corticospinal projections is rare in patients with clinical signs of spasticity after spinal cord injury (SCI). Preserved propriospinal and supraspinal input to a given segmental level may explain why spasticity is a www.e-arm.org frequent consequence in SCI [1]. One hypothesis on the pathophysiology of spasticity highlights the important role of long-term reductions in segmental inhibition rather than primary increases in excitation.",

            "text": "Precise evaluation of spasticity is crucial to establish the efficacy of medical and physical therapeutic interventions. Various diagnostic methods are available to investigate specific influences of spasticity on muscles. The most obvious diagnosis of spasticity is based on the clinical assessment of muscle tone by a physician or physiotherapist, such as the Original Ashworth Scale (AS) [5] and the Modified Tardieu Scale. Spasticity has a neural component that is evoked by a velocity-dependent phenomenon. It also has a biomechanical component, such as soft-tissue compliance, i.e., stiffness [6]. Many studies showed that stiffness increased in spastic muscles due to changes in fiber type transformation. Morphometric and histochemical investigations show changes in mechanical muscle-fiber properties that might contribute to spastic muscle tone [7][8][9][10][11][12]. Changes in biomechanical conditions of a muscle might also have an important effect on the spasticity in people with SCI.",

ARFI is achieved by mechanically exciting tissues with a localized impulsive radiation force. This results in shear wave propagation away from the region of excitation [13]. Shear wave velocity (SWV) is directly correlated with tissue stiffness. In general, greater SWV correlates with stiffer tissue. ARFI imaging has been used to study a variety of tissues, including liver [14], breast [15], kidney [16], spleen [17], prostate [18], pancreas [19], testes [20], thyroid [21], and muscle and tendon [22]. The most notable application of ARFI is the detection of liver fibrosis [23,24], because the fibrous tissues are usually stiffer than the surrounding tissues [25]. However, there is a lack of ARFI application to the spasticity of musculoskeletal tissues.",

All subjects were scanned on an examination platform in the prone position with feet hanging over the edge. Ultrasound were repeatedly performed at the fixed point of the medial GCM, which was located at the middle of 2 reference points (1 point was located at the proximal one third of a longitudinal line from midway between the medial and lateral malleoli to midway between the medial and lateral epicondyles; the other point was located at the medial end on a transverse line perpendicular to the point on the longitudinal line) and performed at the BFLH, which was located at the midpoint between ischial tuberosity and lateral condyle of tibia. Scanning was discontinued whenever reflexive or voluntary contraction of the lower limb muscles was visually apparent. The target muscle was displayed in Bmode and the region of interest (ROI) was subsequently identified in the muscle. ARFI technology uses shortduration acoustic radiation forces to generate localized tissue displacement, which results in shear-wave propagation [7]. The ROI is characterized by a box with a fixed dimension of 0.5 cm 2 for ARFI measurements during real-time B-mode imaging. The shear waves propagate perpendicular to the acoustic pulse, away from the target ROI. The velocity of the shear wave speed is expressed in m/s (Fig. 1).",

This result indicated that spastic muscle was hard and stiff, as compared with non-spastic muscles, because SWV is proportionate to tissue hardness.
