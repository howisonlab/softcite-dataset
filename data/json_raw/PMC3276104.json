            "text": "Cadmium (Cd) is a phytotoxic heavy metal that causes rapid growth reduction. To investigate if Cd interferes with the metabolism of auxin, a major growth hormone in plants, poplars (Populus3canescens) expressing a heterologous GH3::GUS reporter gene were exposed to 50 mM Cd in hydroponic solutions. Growth, photosynthetic performance, lignification, peroxidase activity, auxin concentration, and GUS staining were determined in order to record the activities of GH3 enzymes in the stem apex, the elongation zone, wood in the zone of radial growth, and in roots. Cdinduced growth reductions were tissue-specific decreasing in the order: roots>wood>shoot elongation and leaf initiation, whereas Cd concentrations increased in the order: leaves<wood<roots. Cd almost abolished the GH3 signal in the stem apex but caused strong increases in the vascular system of roots as well as in parenchymatic cells in the xylem. These changes were accompanied by increases in lignin and peroxidase activities and decreases in auxin concentrations. Since GH3 enzymes remove auxin from the active pool by conjugation and act as mediators between growth and defence, our data suggest that Cd stress triggered increases in GH3 activities which, in turn, depleted auxin in wood and thereby shunted the metabolism to enhanced formation of lignin.",

Although it has no known physiological functions, plants cannot prevent its uptake since it occurs via metal transporters required for essential elements (Verbruggen et al., 2009). Cd can be accumulated to high concentrations in roots, whereas only a minor portion is loaded into the xylem and transported to the above-ground tissues with the transpiration stream (Polle and Sch\u00fc tzend\u00fcbel, 2003). Cd causes inhibition of photosynthesis resulting in biomass loss and may eventually cause plant death (Sanita di Toppi and Gabrielli, 1999).",

Cd toxicity was attributed to the formation of reaction oxygen species and uncontrolled cell death when the antioxidative capacity of the cells was overwhelmed (Gratao et al., 2005;Sharma and Dietz, 2009). However, reductions in growth occur much faster than the visible symptoms of injury. For example, root elongation in herbaceous as well as in tree species was retarded rapidly within hours of Cd exposure (Godbold and H\u00fc ttermann, 1985;Arduini et al., 1994;Sch\u00fc tzend\u00fcbel et al., 2001Sch\u00fc tzend\u00fcbel et al., , 2002Wojcik and Tukiendorf, 2005;Weber et al., 2006).

            "text": "Auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) is the most abundant natural growth hormone in plants controlling apical dominance, tropism, shoot elongation, and root initiation (Vanneste and Friml, 2009). Apical dominance is maintained by an auxin gradient that is formed by IAA transport from the shoot apical meristem to the base (Vernoux et al., 2010). Meristematic tissues are the main source of auxins. Therefore, cellular concentrations in the plant body are mainly controlled by transport processes, degradation or conjugation with other metabolites (e.g. amino acids, carbohydrates, etc) into inactive forms (Normanly et al., 1995). The conjugation to amino acids is catalysed by auxin amido synthases (group II GH3 enzymes). Their promoters are regulated by common auxin-responsive promoter elements (Staswick et al., 2005). Recently, it was discovered that GH3 enzymes constitute a link between plant growth adaptation and environmental constraints since they decrease the concentrations of active auxin, thereby inactivating auxinregulated genes and shifting the resources to defence (Park et al., 2008).",

In poplar stems exposed to salt stress, decreases in free auxin were paralleled by decreases in vessel lumina and increased wall strengths as an adaptation to the increased osmotic pressure (Junghans et al., 2006). Recently, Teichmann et al. (2008) observed cell-specific developmental patterns and changes in response to bending or salinity using poplars transformed with the well characterized auxin-responsive soybean GH3::GUS reporter gene (Hagen et al., 1991). Their results indicated that adjustment of the internal auxin balance in wood in response to environmental cues involves GH3 auxin conjugate synthases, pointing to a role of these enzymes in plant stress adaptation.",

In Cd-treated plants, a clear shift in GUS staining was found: while the phloem retained GUS activity, it was no longer detected in the outer bark (Fig. 3C). Woody tissues of Cd-treated plants exhibited higher GUS activity along ray and axial parenchyma than controls leading to the impression of strong blue staining of the whole xylem (Fig. 3C). The wood of Cd-exposed poplars contained about 2-fold higher lignin concentrations than that of the controls. The increased lignification corresponded to increased peroxidase activities, while auxin concentrations dropped below the detection limit (Table 4). Histochemical lignin analysis in stem cross-sections showed that the gross pattern of lignification was unaffected, but that Cd-exposed plants displayed a darker outer xylem ring compared to untreated controls (see Supplementary Fig. S2 at JXB online). The difference in staining intensity was clearer at higher magnification and particularly pronounced in the zone of the young xylem, which displayed almost no coloration in controls and strong staining in Cd-exposed plants (Fig. 4A, B). Similarly, lignin autofluorescence appeared dampened in the young developing xylem of controls ( Fig. 4C) and bright, especially around the new vessels, in Cd-exposed plants (Fig. 4D). The vessels formed under the influence of Cd were smaller than those of controls (Fig. 4).",

This indicates tissuespecific Cd sensitivity. Previous studies revealed that Cd also caused tissue-specific oxidative stress in poplar with   higher H 2 O 2 formation in wood than in roots (He et al., 2011). In Cd-exposed roots H 2 O 2 accumulation was confined to the root elongation zone and growth reductions have been attributed to peroxidase-mediated cell wall cross-linking and lignification (Sch\u00fc tzend\u00fcbel et al., 2001(Sch\u00fc tzend\u00fcbel et al., , 2002. Morphological and anatomical changes such as reduced root elongation and the formation of smaller vessels have also been detected in Cd-exposed pea roots (Rodriguez-Serrano  et al., 2006). The present data suggest that an up-regulation of GH3 enzymes might have contributed to growth attenuation and the activation of defences since, in addition to the increases in lignin found here, strong accumulation of phenolic compounds has also been reported for Cd-exposed poplar roots (He et al., 2011). Our cytochemical data indicate that these increases were particularly pronounced in the young developing xylem, thereby probably leading to a loss in tissue extensibility, and thus, the observed growth reduction.",

Early studies have demonstrated links between auxin and lignin formation. For example, incubation of wheat internodes with auxin inhibited lignin formation (Parish, 1969). Stimulation of auxin catabolism by Cd resulted in increased lignification in the stems of pea (Chaoui and El Ferjani, 2005). In Arabidopsis, copper stress decreased auxin levels, increased lignification, and decreased root elongation (Lequeux et al., 2010). Our data show that Cd has a strong effect on auxin physiology by affecting the pattern of GH3 enzymes (Figs 2, 3). It has previously been shown that GH3::GUS was inducible by external auxin application and that high GUS staining intensity in the apex corresponded to high auxin concentration in this tissue (Teichmann et al., 2008). Decreased GUS activities in the stem apex of Cdexposed plants probably indicate decreases in auxin biosynthesis. Similarly, Arabidopsis seedlings expressing GUS under the synthetic auxin-sensitive DR5 promoter suggested reductions in auxin in cotyledons of Cd-exposed plants (Xu et al., 2010).",

While untreated poplars displayed decreasing GUS staining from the apex to the base, which correlated with decreasing IAA concentrations (Teichmann et al., 2008), Cd exposure reversed the staining pattern, even though Cdstressed wood contained almost no free auxin (Table 4). At first glance, this result appears paradoxical. However, it is important to note that tissue sensitivity to auxin changes with environmental and physiological stage (Ludwig-M\u00fcller, 2011). Furthermore, GH3 promoters contain other regulatory elements in addition to auxin response motives, in particular binding sites for bZIP and Myb transcription factors (Liu et al., 1994;Ulmasov et al., 1995;Heinekamp et al., 2004;Shin et al., 2007). Screening of Arabidopsis microarrays retrieves  Fig. 3. Changes in GH3::GUS induction along the stem axis of P.3canescens. GUS staining was performed in the stem apex (A), the elongation zone, 25 mm below the apex (B), and in the secondary growth zone, 150 mm above the bottom (C). The three panels represent WT and two independent GH3::GUS reporter lines, which were treated with or without cadmium (50 lM) in the nutrient solution for 24 d. The scale bar for each panel is indicated in one picture.

Myb77 senses energy limitations and regulates GH3 enzymes accordingly (Shin et al., 2007). The mechanistic details in poplar remain elusive, but the decreases in CO 2 assimilation (Table 1) indicate reduced carbohydrate supply in Cd-stressed poplars. The strong activation of GH3 enzymes in the wood of these plants suggests that, under these conditions, high IAA conjugation rates take place depleting the pool of active auxin. Since the loss of auxin was high (Table 4), it is likely that the conjugates were targeted to oxidative degradation (\u00d6 stin et al., 1998). This, together with lacking replenishment of the cellular pools by import, might have switched the metabolism from growth to defence involving the activation of peroxidases and lignification.",
