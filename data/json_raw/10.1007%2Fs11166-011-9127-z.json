            "text": "Many experiments have demonstrated that when evaluating payoffs, people take not only their own payoffs into account, but also the payoffs of others in their social environment. Most of this evidence is found in settings where payoffs are riskless. It is plausible that if people care about the payoffs of others, they do so not only in a riskless context, but also in a risky one. This suggests that an individual's decision making under risk depends on the risks others in his or her environment face. This paper is the first to test whether individuals' risk attitudes are affected by the risks others face. The results show that risk attitudes appear to be less affected by others' risks than expected, even though the same subjects do show concerns for inequality in a riskless setting. Interestingly, we find that people prefer risks to be independent across individuals in society rather than correlated. There is ample evidence that people care not only about their own payoffs, but also about the payoffs of others (Fehr and Schmidt 2002; Sobel 2005).

Translating this to a social context, and assuming that the reference point is at least partly determined by the payoffs of others, we expect that the payoffs of others have an impact on the choices people make between lotteries that affect only themselves. Thus, we posit that people's choices between lotteries are not only affected by the lotteries themselves, but also by the payoffs and lotteries others face. In other words, people's risk attitudes are likely to depend on the payoffs and lotteries others face. To stress this dependency, we refer to risk attitudes as social risk attitudes. In this paper we do a first test to analyze to what extent risk attitudes indeed are social risk attitudes.",

We refer to the first option as a \"lottery\" and to the latter as the \"corresponding allocation.\" The expected value and the possible outcomes are the same in both options.

A choice between these options sheds light on our experience of facing risks of natural disasters, influenza pandemics, terrorist attacks, and airplane crashes, where risks show a strong correlation with others in our environment, compared to events with similar, but uncorrelated risks.",

Thus, when choosing, the decision maker cannot influence the payoffs and risks of the other subjects in the group. While the payoffs and risks of other subjects cannot be influenced, this does not mean that they play no role. From the literature on social preferences (Sobel 2005) we know that people evaluate allocations of money by taking into account not only their own payoffs, but also the payoffs of others, often their peers. This finding suggests that, when evaluating lotteries for themselves, people do take into account the lotteries others face.

In peer risk questions we fix the lottery that the decision maker will receive and let him choose between allocation lotteries for the other individuals in the group. In these questions we mostly focus on different types of allocation lotteries. Each type of allocation lottery can be seen as a different allocation rule, where the decision maker acts as a social planner. We let subjects choose between, for instance, an allocation where each 'other subject' receives an independent lottery yielding 20 euro with 30% probability and 10 euro otherwise, and an allocation yielding 20 euro to 30% of the other subjects and 10 euro to the rest of the other subjects. We refer to the first option as a lottery and to the latter as the corresponding allocation. In the latter, the subjects receiving a particular payoff will be randomly determined, so that every subject still has 30% probability of receiving 20 euro and 70% probability of receiving 10 euro. The resolution of the latter lottery, however, is not independent across subjects. The appeal of this type of question is that it indicates how subjects care about the correlation of their payoffs and risks with the payoffs and risks of others.",

In 1841, an American ship struck an iceberg close to Newfoundland. The crew and half of the passengers managed to escape in two available lifeboats. One of these lifeboats was overcrowded. In a desperate attempt to keep this lifeboat from sinking, the crew members threw persons overboard by using the criteria that no woman would be thrown overboard and that no couples would be separated. Crewman Alexander Holmes was later on convicted of 'unlawful homicide' and was sentenced to jail by the judge. The interesting aspect of this story is that Holmes was not convicted because of the manslaughter but rather because of the fact that he had not cast lots: \"In no other than this or some like way are those having equal rights put upon equal footing ...\" The council, however, argued that the principle of selection the crewman used was more humane than using lots.

The subjects are offered 4 types of choices. In the first type of choice the subject chooses between (30% : 23, 70% : 3) 2 and 10 for sure for himself. As in this question one of the lotteries is a payoff to be received with certainty, we label this type of question 'Certainty'.

Neither of these two is a MPS of the other. An important difference between these lotteries is the minimum payoff attainable, which the subjects may choose to maximize.

In that question, the resulting allocation would always be constant, i.e. without any inequality. This question, therefore, reveals subjects' risk attitudes in isolation, i.e. if there would be no others. A similar question, which does allow for inequality in final allocations, is the one where the other subjects receive the same lottery as the decision maker, but where this lottery is independently resolved for each subject. A subject only concerned with ex ante opportunities of others would not behave differently in this question compared to the benchmark question. Subjects who are concerned with the equality of final allocations might behave differently, though.",

Finally, there are questions, like C6, that are of the lottery type as discussed in the description of peer risk questions and there are questions of the corresponding allocation type, like C7. Note that in C7 the subjects who would receive 15 would be determined randomly. Table 6 in Appendix A lists the peer risk questions. In questions P1, P3, and P7 subjects are asked to choose between a lottery and the corresponding allocation. Questions P2, P4, and P5 illustrate whether the lotteries of the decision maker in P1, P3, and P7 are considered to be better or worse than the lottery that guarantees equality. We added P6 to test for consistency, as the answer in P5 and P7 would, together with transitivity, predict the answer in P6. P8, P9, and P10 test whether subjects are concerned with equality among the others. Finally, P11 and P12 test whether subjects like to be ahead of others and whether they dislike others being ahead.",

The driving forces of decisions in the ultimatum game are not only preferences over final allocations, but also reciprocity concerns: people may behave in a certain way to induce others to behave in a certain way. It may well be that a social norm and reciprocity concerns conflict with a person's preferences over final allocations, which makes it impossible to disentangle preferences over final allocations from reciprocity concerns in the existing experiments. Reciprocity is not present in one-stage games. Therefore, one can argue that in the dictator game reciprocity plays no role. As we are interested in preferences over final allocations rather than reciprocity concerns, the dictator game might be more suitable for our purposes than the ultimatum game.",

On top of that, in C4 and C8 they can even avoid another type of risk by choosing lottery 2, namely the risk of facing an unequal allocation. Choosing lottery 1 in C4, could lead to inequality as the others will face the exact same lottery. Choosing lottery 1 in C8 would lead to inequality anyhow.

They prefer the lottery to the corresponding distribution. This result suggests that subjects are not willing to be held responsible for determining the allocation of payoffs. They would rather have fate determine the actual payoffs of the other subjects. In that sense, they are decision averse. Interestingly, we observe this preference irrespective of whether the other subjects face a higher, an equal or a lower expected value than the decision maker. However, we do observe significantly more subjects choosing the lottery when the expected value for the other subjects is lower than the expected value for the decision maker (signtest P1 vs P3: p = 0.001, one-sided, and signtest P3 vs P7: p = 0.003, one sided).",

Subjects seem to be maximizing the expected values of the other subjects. However, this interpretation does not explain why we find a significant preference for 'the same payoff as you' in case where the expected values of all subjects are identical. This brings us to the second possible explanation. In all questions where subjects prefer to choose the same payoff as themselves for the other subjects, the lottery or allocation they would otherwise get contains the worst possible outcome in comparison to the lowest possible outcome in their own lottery. Maximizing the other subjects' worst possible outcome, therefore seems to be another plausible motive. Both motives are actually confirmed by the results found for P11 and P12. In these two questions the lottery which maximizes the other subjects' (worst possible) payoff is significantly more often chosen (signtest: p < 0.001 for both questions). Subjects are thus willing to maximize the (worst possible) payoff of others, even if this may lead to being worse off than these other subjects. In P11, 87.60% and in P12, 85.95% of the subjects behaved in this way.",

Thus, strictly speaking, in the WTA treatment the decision maker chooses between an allocation lottery and an allocation where he receives the WTA and his partner receives nothing. Therefore, in the choice the lottery of the other player is not kept fixed. When choosing (or determining the WTA or WTP) the player thus simultaneously determines his own and his partner's payoff. In the analysis of the results, though, Brennan et al. compare the WTP and WTA from the four allocation lotteries. In that sense their experiment is close in spirit to ours.

Second, their experiment includes a large proportion of questions where the decision maker simultaneously influences his own and the other's payoff. Third, subjects are randomly paired with one other subject in their study, while we consider all subjects in one session as one group.

The key feature of our experiment is to keep either the lottery of the decision maker or the lottery that others receive fixed, and to vary the other lottery. Then repeating the questions for a different fixed lottery allows us to explore risk attitudes in a social context. It allows us to analyze whether risk attitudes depend on the lotteries others face. Since the decision makers do not influence the payoffs of others in this context, choices cannot be driven by intentions, social pressure or reciprocity. Thus, our results are not confounded by reciprocity and fully reflect preferences over allocations.",

Since a large majority of the subjects did choose to maximize others' payoffs if this would not influence their own payoffs, we can nevertheless not conclude that they are purely selfish. Combined with the results from the debriefing, these results suggest that subjects have lexicographic social preferences whereby they first maximize their own utility and only then the utility of others. Striking is the finding that subjects prefer lotteries to their corresponding allocations, where risks are perfectly independent across subjects. This suggests that they prefer risks to be independent across members of the population rather than correlated. It also indicates that subjects prefer everybody to undergo the same procedure, thereby avoiding the possibility to be held responsible for bad outcomes of others.",

The lotteries of different participants are thus independent and do not necessarily yield the same payoff. This means that when your lottery turns out to yield 17 euro, this does not increase or decrease the probability of another person getting 15 euro. Moreover, if the lottery of one other participant, called participant A, turns out to yield 15 euro, then the probability that another participant, called participant B, also gets 15 euro remains 2/5. Participant B does not necessarily then also receive 15 euro. For him the lottery is also played, and he also gets 15 euro with the probability 2/5.
