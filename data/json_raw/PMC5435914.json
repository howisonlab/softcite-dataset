Data showing that the p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetylates p27 inducing its degradation suggested that PCAF and p27 could collaborate in the regulation of transcription. However, this possibility remained to be explored. We analyzed here the transcriptional programs regulated by PCAF and p27 in the colon cancer cell line HCT116 by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). We identified 269 protein-encoding genes that contain both p27 and PCAF binding sites being the majority of these sites different for PCAF and p27. PCAF or p27 knock down revealed that both regulate the expression of these genes, PCAF as an activator and p27 as a repressor. The double knock down of PCAF and p27 strongly reduced their expression indicating that the activating role of PCAF overrides the repressive effect of p27. We also observed that the transcription factor Pax5 interacts with both p27 and PCAF and that the knock down of Pax5 induces the expression of p27/PCAF target genes indicating that it also participates in the transcriptional regulation mediated by p27/PCAF. In summary, we report here a previously unknown mechanism of transcriptional regulation mediated by p27, Pax5 and PCAF.",

            "text": "The protein p27 Kip1 (p27) is a member of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors that also includes p21 Cip1 and p57 Kip2  (1). Its classical role is to inhibit the activity of most cyclin-Cdk complexes involved in cell cycle progression. It interacts with both cyclin and Cdk subunits by the KID domain sited on its amino moiety (2). The KID consists of three subdomains: the cyclin-binding subdomain (D1), the Cdk-binding subdomain (D2) and a linker subdomain that joins D1 and D2 (3). Phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the D2 subdomain (Y74 and Y88), by members of the Src family of kinases, allows the partial activation of the Cdk in the trimeric complexes formed by cyclin, Cdk and p27 (4,5). Thus, p27 behaves as a dual regulator of cyclin-Cdk complexes by inhibiting their activities in the non-tyrosine phosphorylated form and allowing Cdk to be active when phosphorylated at these specific tyrosine residues. p27 directly interacts with the acetyltransferase and transcriptional co-activator p300/CBP associated factor (PCAF) by a region (aa 91-120) containing a proline rich domain (PRD, aa 91-96) included in the D2 subdomain of p27 (6). PCAF interacts with p27 by its catalytic domain and acetylates p27 at Lysine 100, very close to the PRD. This acetylation induces its ubiquitylation and the subsequent degradation via proteasome (6). Thus, Src kinases and PCAF regulate cell cycle progression by generating post-translational modifications of p27 that lead to the activation of cyclin-Cdk complexes.",

It associates with a number of gene promoters through E2F4/p130 complexes behaving as a transcriptional repressor of these genes (9). The specific role of p27 on these repressor complexes is to recruit cyclin D2/D3-Cdk4 complexes needed for p130 phosphorylation at early-mid G1 phase (10). This possibility is supported by the fact that the interaction of p27 with E2F4 and p130 is through its carboxyl-moiety (9) indicating that the KID subdomain in the NH2 region will be free to associate with cyclin-Cdk complexes when they appear at early G1. The role of p27 as a transcriptional repressor mediated by E2F4/p130 complexes has been confirmed by a recent work showing that p27 represses transcription of SOX2 through this mechanism (11).",

In most of the cases, low p27 levels are due to post-transcriptional mechanisms that induce its proteasome-dependent degradation (15,16). Interestingly, the over-expression of p27-target genes (p27-TGs) in human tumors correlates with poor clinical outcome suggesting that the transcriptional regulatory function of p27 plays an important role in tumor development (9). Thus, to understand how p27 regulates transcription is an important goal to be achieved not only to better define the mechanisms involved in cell cycle regulation but also the role of p27 in tumorigenesis.",

In the case of PCAF the 76% of the genes were encoding for proteins, the 13% for pseudogenes and the remaining 11% corresponded to non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) ( Figure 1B). Intriguingly, the 41% of the genes putatively regulated by p27 corresponded to nc-RNAs (23%) and to pseudogenes (18%) and only the 59% were genes encoding for proteins ( Figure  1B). These results indicate that both, p27 and PCAF, but p27 in a higher extension, can play a significant role in the expression of nc-RNAs and pseudogenes.",

Results revealed that the four more significant biological processes were: cell adhesion, neuron differentiation, cell-cell signaling and ion transport (Figure 2A). In the case of PCAF, due the high number of peaks, the analyses had to be done in two separated groups. One group contained the genes with PCAF-BSs in intragenic regions and the other included genes with PCAF-BSs in intergenic regions. Interestingly, the four biological processes enriched in p27-target genes (p27-TGs) were also significantly enriched ( Figure 2B and C). We observed that around 50% of p27-TGs in these four groups also contained PCAF-BSs (Supplementary Figure S2). These results suggest that p27 and PCAF can collaborate in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in these cellular functions. To further confirm this data, GO analysis using the Gitools program was additionally performed. Results showed that three of the biological processes (cell adhesion, neuron differentiation and ion transport) shared by p27 and PCAF-TGs were also found to be significantly enriched using this more restrictive program ( Figure 2D).",

GO analysis revealed that the most significantly enriched group was cell cycle ( Figure 3D). Interestingly, GO analysis of down-regulated genes revealed that most of these cell cycle regulatory genes were down-regulated in PCAF-KD cells (Supplementary Figure S3B). These results suggest that PCAF regulates cell cycle progression by controlling the expression of a number of relevant cell cycle regulatory genes. Genes up-regulated are mainly involved in translation and apoptosis (Supplementary Figure S3C). On comparing ChIP-seq and expression microarrays data we observed that 156 genes from those differentially expressed in the PCAF-KD cells also showed PCAF-BSs suggesting that PCAF participates in the regulation of the expression of these genes by associating with regulatory protein complexes at these specific sites ( Figure 3E). The rest of the genes could be genes indirectly regulated by PCAF. GO analysis of these 156 genes showed that a significant number of them are involved in cellular functions related to cell adhesion and neurogenesis (Supplementary Figure S3D).

Additionally, KD experiments using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line gave similar results: whereas the KD p27 increased transcription of TGs, the KD of PCAF reduced their expression ( Supplementary Figure S6).",

            "text": "The identification of TFs that could bind to p27-and PCAF-BSs was performed by studying 150 bp regions of these peaks (75 bp up the maximum and 75 bp down) by using the STORM tool for the scanning of the peaks and the TF-BSs motif position weight matrix from TRANS-FAC. The ten TFs more significantly identified have been represented in a heat map that compares results from p27 and PCAF ( Figure 6A). Interestingly, only PAX5 appears to be able to significantly associate to the p27-BSs. In contrast, a number of different TFs can putatively associate to the PCAF-BSs and among these different candidates PAX5 was one of the most significant ( Figure 6A). Interestingly, The consensus sequence for Pax5 (Supplementary Figure  S7) is quite similar to the sequences found for p27 and PCAF ( Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure S7). Interestingly, the sequence analysis of the chromatin peaks for p27 and PCAF of a number of genes ( Table 1) also revealed that these sequences also include regions of high similarity with the PAX5 consensus sequence (data not shown). Hence, we aimed to analyze the putative interaction of PAX5 with both p27 and PCAF by IP. We observed that PAX5 levels  . Effect of knocking down p27 or PCAF on the expression of target genes. (A) HCT116 cells were infected with a specific shRNA for p27 (shp27) or with a control shRNA (sh(-)). Then, mRNA levels of different common target genes (see Table 1) were determined by qPCR. In these cells, the levels of primary non spliced transcripts (PNST) were also determined by qPCR (B). (C) HCT116 cells were infected with a specific shRNA for PCAF (shPCAF) or with a control shRNA (sh(-)) and the levels of mRNA of different common target genes were subsequently determined by qPCR. In these cells, the levels of primary non spliced transcripts (PNST) were also determined by qPCR (D). Levels of mRNA (E) or of primary non spliced transcripts (PNST) (F) from different common target genes were determined in p27 knocked down cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 (CR p27) methodology and in control cells (CR Ctrl). Levels of mRNA (G) or of primary non spliced transcripts (PNST) (H) from different common target genes were determined in PACF knocked down cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 (CR PCAF) methodology and in control cells (CR Ctrl). In all experiments results are the mean value \u00b1 SEM of four independent experiments and are represented as fold enrichment versus control. Statistical analyses were performed using the t-student's test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.  Figure S8A). IP experiments using anti-PAX5 were performed in asynchronously growing HCT116 cells. Results revealed that this protein interacts with both p27 and PCAF ( Figure 6B). Also reciprocal IPs using anti-p27 and anti-PCAF showed this interaction (Supplementary Figure S8B and C). Interestingly, the absence of PCAF did not affect the interaction between PAX5 and p27 (Supplementary Figure S8D). Similarly, the absence of p27 did not alter the association between PAX5 and PCAF (Supplementary Figure S8E). These results suggest that PAX5 is able to bind to both (p27 and PCAF), most probably through different binding sites because in the absence of p27 the levels of PCAF associated to PAX5 are quite similar to those associated in its presence (Supplementary Figure S8E). The interaction of p27 with its specific binding site in the GRIN3A, SPAG9, ROBO1 and UNC5D genes was validated by ChIP in HCT116 cells ( Figure 6C, upper panel). Additionally, the specificity of the interaction was validated by ChIP in HCT116 p27KO cells (Supplementary Figure S9A). Moreover, the interaction of PCAF with its specific binding site in the same genes was also validated by ChIP ( Figure 6C bottom panel). Next, ChIP analysis with anti-PAX5 showed the binding of PAX5 to the p27-and PCAF-BSs of the same group of genes (Figure 6D) indicating that PAX5 is able to associate to both p27 and PCAF-BSs. Finally, ChIP experiments performed in HCT116 cells knocked down for PAX5 revealed a sig-nificant decreased association of p27 and PCAF to their respective binding sites, suggesting that PAX5 mediates the interaction of both proteins with DNA ( Supplementary Figure S9B). Interestingly, we observed that the mRNA and the protein levels of several target genes were increased in PAX5-KD cells ( Figure 6E, F and G). All these data indicate that PAX5 collaborates in the transcriptional regulation of specific p27 and PCAF target genes playing a role as a repressor.",

PCAF behaves as a transcriptional coactivator by acetylating a number of different substrates, the most well-known being histones, although non-histones proteins are also substrates of PCAF (36). These include TFs as c-myc, E2F1, GATA-2 and Myo-D (38)(39)(40)(41), other proteins involved in transcription as Cdk9 and some cell cycle regulatory proteins as p27, cdk2 and cyclin A (6,(42)(43)(44).",

The first interesting observation was that the distribution of the binding sites of both proteins overall genome was very different. Intriguingly, only a small number of p27-BSs were on gene promoters while most of them were in distal intergenic (74%) or in intronic regions (24%). These results expand the previous information of the identification of p27-BSs performed by ChIP on chip in NIH3T3 cells in which only the association of p27 with gene promoters was analyzed (9) and reveals for the first time that the role of p27 in the regulation of transcription is mainly produced by associating to chromatin regions distal from the promoters. In contrast, around the 60% of the PCAF-BSs were on the gene body (intron and exon regions) or in proximal regions.",

It's worth noting that the 45% of protein-encoding p27-TGs also contain PCAF binding sites indicating that this transcriptional co-activator could be a very important partner of p27 in the regulation of transcription. In fact, we demonstrate here the cooperation between these two proteins in the regulation of transcription of a number of common targets. Specifically, by knocking down p27, PCAF or both we have seen that PCAF operates as a co-activator and p27 as a repressor and that PCAF is  Figure 6.

In this model, p27 associated to specific regulatory domains of the chromatin represses transcription of its target genes. To activate transcription PCAF (associated to a different regulatory domain) interacts with p27, possible by a change in chromatin conformation. Then, PCAF acetylates p27 inducing its degradation. Whether the p27ubiquitylating enzyme is the own PCAF still remains unknown but this is an attractive possibility. Degradation of p27 would eliminate the repressor role of this protein and would allow PCAF to act as a transcriptional co-activator. That PCAF mediated acetylation occurs on p27 associated to the regulatory chromatin BSs still remains to be demonstrated. However, a similar mechanism has been reported to operate during the activation of the Hedgehog pathway (49). Authors described that cells subjected to a genotoxic stress induce the p53-dependent transcriptional activation and accumulation of PCAF (50). Then, PCAF associates with and acetylates the TF GLI1 that is subsequently ubiquitylated by the intrinsic ubiquitin E3 ligase of PCAF that induced its degradation. As a consequence, GLI1 targets cannot be transcribed.",

PAX5 belongs to the PAX family of TFs that include 9 members that are involved in the control of development (51). Specifically, PAX5 is essential for commitment of lymphoid progenitors to the B lymphocyte lineage. It activates the expression of B-lineage specific genes but represses a subset of genes not needed for this process of differentiation (52). Interestingly, mice lacking PAX5 in mature B cells develop aggressive lymphomas (53). We report here that PAX5 interacts with both p27 and PCAF, that it associates to p27and PCAF-BSs and that the knockdown of PAX5 increased transcription of p27/PCAF-TGs indicating that it behaves as a transcriptional repressor of these genes together with p27. An attractive speculation is that PAX5, similarly to p27, could be a PCAF substrate and that PAX5 acetylation could lead to its inactivation as a transcriptional repressor. However, this possibility remains to be explored. In summary, we describe here a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation mediated by p27, PAX5 and PCAF that might be relevant for the control of several important biological processes and that can participate in the development of different pathological situations as for instance tumorigenesis.",
