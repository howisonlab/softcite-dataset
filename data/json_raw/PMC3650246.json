            "text": "MicroRNA-29b (miR-29b) expression has been shown to be reduced in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues. Here, we have identified the oncogene cyclin-dependent protein kinase 6 (CDK6) as a direct target of miR-29b in lung cancer. We hypothesized that in vivo restoration of miR-29b and thus targeting of genes important to tumor initiation and progression may represent an option for lung cancer treatment. We developed a cationic lipoplexes (LPs)-based carrier that efficiently delivered miR-29b both in vitro and in vivo. LPs containing miR-29b (LP-miR-29b) efficiently delivered miR-29b to NSCLC A549 cells, reduced the expression of key targets CDK6, DNMT3B, and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1), as well as cell growth and clonogenicity of A549 cells. In addition, the IC 50 for cisplatin in the miR-29b-treated cells was effectively reduced. In a xenograft murine model, LPs efficiently accumulated at tumor sites. Systemic delivery of LP-miR-29b increased the tumor miR-29b expression by approximately fivefold, downregulated the tumor mRNA expression of CDK6, DNMT3B, and MCL1 by ~57.4, ~40.5, and ~52.4%, respectively, and significantly inhibited tumor growth by ~60% compared with LP-miR-NC (negative control). Our results demonstrate that cationic LPs represent an efficient delivery system that holds great potential in the development of miRNA-based therapeutics for lung cancer treatment.",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nucleotide) endogenous non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level through RNA interference. 4,5 MiRNAs are actively involved in many biological processes and have an impact on many diseases including cancer. Differential expression of miRNAs has been demonstrated in many types of cancer. These miRNAs carry both diagnostic and prognostic information and have been shown to alter cancer cell phenotype by targeting biological pathways critical to tumorigenesis. [6][7][8] For example, recent studies have suggested that members of miR-29 family may play an important role in cancer by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. 9,10 Downregulation of miR-29 family members has been observed in leukemia, [11][12][13][14] melanoma, 15 liver, 16 colon, 17 cervical, 18 and lung cancer. [19][20][21] In lung cancer, Fabbri et al. recently determined that miR-29 members functionally targeted DNA methytransferases (DNMT) 3A and 3B, two key enzymes involved in DNA methylation and often related to the survival of patients with lung cancer. 20 Re-expression of miR-29 in lung cancer cells restored normal DNA methylation patterns and thus induced re-expression of methylation-silenced tumor suppressor genes, such as FHIT and WWOX, and inhibited tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Rothschild et al. determined that miR-29b was involved in the Src-ID1 signaling pathway thus regulating lung cancer cell migration and invasion. 21 As a result, miR-29 has become an attractive candidate for miRNA-based therapeutics.",

            "text": "The development of miRNA-based therapeutics represents a new strategy in cancer treatment. However, targeted in vivo delivery of miRNAs faces many challenges including limited stability in serum, rapid blood clearance, off-target effects, and poor cellular uptake. 22 Chemical modifications (locked nucleic acid, 2\u2032-O-methylation, etc.), and nanoparticle delivery systems have been developed to overcome these challenges. Alternatively, miRNAs can be delivered as a precursor shRNA encoded by a plasmid via viral vectors. Delivery by nanoparticles has the advantages of being more cost-effective, less immunogenic, less toxic and less oncogenic. 23 However, only three groups have published results on the development of nanoparticle delivery systems to systemically deliver miRNAs for lung cancer treatment. Chen et al. established a liposomepolycation-hyaluronicacid-based nanoparticle to effectively deliver siRNA and miR-34a in a syngeneic model of B16F10 lung metastases. 24  Wiggins et al. and Trang et al. used a neutral lipid emulsion, Max Suppressor in vivo RNA LancerII (BIOO Scientific) to deliver both miR-34a and let-7 to inhibit tumor growth in lung cancer mouse models. 25,26 Our group developed a cationic lipoplexes (LPs)-based carrier system for miR-133b delivery. 27 In the current study, we used a cationic LPs-based delivery system to efficiently deliver miR-29b to suppress tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo by downregulating multiple oncogenes, including cyclin-dependent protein kinase 6 (CDK6), DNMT3B, and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1).",

Cellular uptake was evaluated at 4, 24, and 48 hours after transfection by flow cytometry (Figure 1c). At 4 hours after transfection the mean fluorescence intensity of FAM in A549 cells treated by LP-FAM-miR-NC was much higher than that of NeoFX-FAM-miR-NC. In addition, LP-FAM-miR-NC transfected cells demonstrated a narrower FAM fluorescence distribution than NeoFX-FAM-miR-NC. Confocal microscopy images also showed stronger and more uniform cellular uptake of LP-FAM-miR-NC than NeoFX-FAM-miR-NC (Figure 1d). These results demonstrate that LPs are a more efficient delivery system in vitro than NeoFX complexes. At 24 and 48 hours after transfection, the mean fluorescence intensity of FAM was progressively decreased in A549 cells transfected by both LPs and NeoFX complexes, which was due to the degradation of FAM-labeled miR-NC and the \"dilution\" effect by the cell growth. On the basis of the observation, delivery of miR-29b every 48 hours might represent a reasonable frequency if repeated delivery is desired. Therefore, LP-miR-29b was delivered every other day in the subsequent in vivo studies.",

In our LPs formulation, 1,2-di-O-octadecenyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTMA, chloride salt), a cationic lipid previously used in nonviral vectors of gene therapy, was selected as the building block of our miRNA delivery system. DOTMA has shown high transfection activities in vitro and in vivo. 28 DOTMA also confers a positive surface charge to the LPs which in turn facilitates the interaction between LPs and the negatively charged cell membrane providing more efficient and uniform cellular uptake. Cholesterol, a neutral lipid, was chosen as a helper lipid because it can improve transfection efficiency in vivo, protecting oligonucleotides from degradation, and facilitating the interaction between LPs and the cell membranes. 29 d-\u03b1-Tocopheryl polyethyleneglycol 1,000 succinate (vitamin E TPGS), a short poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecule linked to vitamin E, was added to increase the stability and circulation time of LPs in vivo. In addition, confocal microscopy images showed that the LPs were able to deliver miR-29b to the nucleus of A549 cells, which is important because endogenous miR-29b is significantly enriched in the cell nucleus. 9 MiR-29b, a potential prognostic marker, targets oncogenes and antiapoptotic genes, and is usually silenced or downregulated in many cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma, CDK6 has been validated as a direct target of miR-29b. 13,30 In HPV-mediated cervical cancer, restoration of miR-29b expression was shown to prevent malignant transformation of cervical cells by targeting CDK6. 18 In NSCLC, miR-29b directly targets DNMT3A and 3B.

            "text": "Lipoplexes miR-NC hepatocellular carcinoma, miR-29b has been shown to target the expression of MCL1 protein, which affects malignant cell survival. 13,16,31 To the best of our best knowledge, no studies have shown the relationship between miR-29b expression and CDK6 expression in NSCLC tumor tissue samples; therefore, we evaluated the expression of miR-29b in 10 pairs of human NSCLC tumor tissue samples and adjacent normal tissue samples. We found that the expression of miR-29b was downregulated in the majority of NSCLC tissue samples compared with normal tissue samples (Figure 2a). We then demonstrated that CDK6 was a direct target of miR-29b (Figure 2b), which was further validated by the downregulation of CDK6 gene expression by LP-miR-29b in vitro (Figure 3) and in vivo (Figure 6). The antitumorigenic properties of LP-miR-29b were first evaluated in A549 cells. Because the delivery efficiency of LPs was superior to that of NeoFX complexes, mature miR-29b expression in A549 cells transfected by LPs was ~12.5 times higher, and all three targets genes (CDK6, DNMT3B, and MCL1) were successfully downregulated at both mRNA and protein levels (Figure 3). LP-miR-29b also showed greater biological activity than NeoFX-miR-29b in A549 cells. Compared with untreated control, ~62 and ~18% inhibition in A549 cell growth was observed in cells treated by LP-miR-29b and NeoFX-miR-29b respectively. The clonogenic survival of A549 cells was reduced by ~53%, and the IC 50 of cisplatin was decreased by ~33% after treatment with LP-miR-29b compared with untreated control (Figure 4). No significant effects were observed in the cells transfected by NeoFX-miR-29b. In the xenograft mouse model, we observed that LPs successfully accumulated at the tumor sites ( Figure 5). Following seven intravenous injections of LP-miR-29b at a dosage of 1.5 mg miR-29b/kg mouse weight, tumor growth was significantly inhibited (Figure 6a,b). Systemic miR-29b delivery by LPs increased tumor miR-29b expression by ~4.7-fold compared with mice treated with LP-miR-NC (Figure 6c). The tumor expression of CDK6, DNMT3B, and MCL1 was significantly downregulated compared with the other three control groups (Figure 6d). Results of Ki-67 and TUNEL staining showed that tumor tissues from LP-miR-29b-treated mice had lower expression of Ki-67 and more apoptotic cells which was in agreement with the observed downregulation of CDK6 and MCL1 expression (Figure 6e). In addition, we did not observe significant cytotoxicity effects of LP-miR-29b on the vital organs of mice, suggesting the off-target effects of miR-29b were minimal (Figure 7a,b). In summary, we have developed a novel cationic LPs-based delivery system that efficiently delivered miR-29b and thus inhibited the tumorigenicity of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate a potential for LPs in the development of miRNA-based therapeutics for lung cancer treatment. In the future, chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cisplatin, might be combined with miRNA-based therapeutic strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy.",
