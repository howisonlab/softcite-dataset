            "text": "Previously, we reported that ovarian hormones affect the immune response against E. coli isolated from the dogs affected with pyometra. In order to investigate mechanisms underlying the immune modulation, we examined the effects of ovarian hormones on the generation of dendritic cells (DCs), the most potent antigen presenting cell. DCs were differentiated from peripheral blood monocytes (PBMOs) using a cytokine cocktail. Both estrogen receptor and progesterone receptors were expressed by the PBMOs and immature DCs. When various ovarian hormones were added to the culture for the DC differentiation, progesterone significantly decreased the expression of DC maturation markers, such as CD1a, CD80 and CD86, on mature DCs. Conversely, the addition of estrogen to the cultures increased the expression of CD86, but not other maturation makers. Furthermore, DCs differentiated in the presence of progesterone did not stimulate allogeneic mononuclear cells in PB. Taken together, these results indicate that progesterone diminishes the maturation of DCs, leading to decreased immune responses against invading pathogens.",

            "text": "Pyometra is a common bacterial disease that is seen in the reproductive system of the female dogs. The majority of disease incidence is observed in the first half of diestrus [1], during which the blood concentration of progesterone is highest, but the level of estradiol-17\u03b2 is lowest [3]. Pyometra is often observed after treatment with progesterone, used to block estrus [18]. These findings suggest ovarian hormones significantly affect the incidence of pyometra. Previously, we found that response of peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells to E. coli isolated from pyometra significantly decreased in the first half of distress, but increased in proestrus/estrus [16]. In addition, the response of PB mononuclear cells was significantly suppressed by the addition of progesterone into the culture, but significantly enhanced in the presence of estradiol-17\u03b2 [16]. This suggests a systemic immune control by ovarian hormone markedly effect on the pathogenesis of pyometra as well as local immune control reported previously [7,8]. However, it is unknown how these PB cell responses are regulated by ovarian hormones.",

It is confirmed that expression of all surface markers investigated in this study significantly increased on the day 6 cultured cells, compared with monocytes as reported previously [17,20] (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, the intensity of the expression was expressed as MFI calculated by the software mentioned. Moreover, since we have found that 17-OHP does not affect the immune responses of the dog PB mononuclear cells, we used that as a control for progesterone. As shown in Fig. 3, when the expression of CD80 or CD86 on the day 12 cultured cells was investigated, 17-OHP did not significantly affect the expression up to 1 \u00b5M. By addition of progesterone, the expression of CD80 and CD86 of cells decreased in a dose dependent manner and significantly lower than that of the 17-OHP culture at 1 \u00b5M, when compared with an untreated control. In contrast, by addition of estrogen, the expression of those molecules increased in a dose dependent manner and significantly higher CD80 expression at 2 and 20 nM when compared with an untreated control. The significantly higher CD86 expression was also observed with 20 nM estrogen. Then, we investigated the expression of those costimulatory molecules and antigen-presenting molecules, MHC class II and CD1a on the day 6 and the day 12 cells in the cultures containing 1 \u00b5M progesterone, 1 \u00b5M 17-OHP or 2 nM estrogen. As shown in Fig. 4, both progesterone and estrogen did not significantly affect the expression of any inves-tigated molecules on the day 6 cells and that of MHC class II on the day 12 cells. The expression of CD80 of the cells in the progesterone culture did not increase from day 6 to day 12. However, the expression of the cells in the 17-OHP and the estrogen culture significantly increased during the 6 days. The expression of CD1a and CD86 on the day 12 cells in culture of any hormones used significantly increased when compared with that on the day 6 cells. Among the day 12 cells, however, the expression of those molecules of the cells in the progesterone culture was significantly lower than that on cells in the 17-OHP or the estrogen culture.

However, it is expected the differentiation and maturation of DCs should be affected by the hormones because DC is the sole initiator of primary immune responses and the most potent activator of secondary responses [15].

            "text": "In the examination of surface markers, progesterone significantly decreased expression of CD1a, CD80 and CD86 on the mature DC, but not on the immature DCs. We have found that the expression of these markers significantly relates to DC maturation [17,20]. Moreover, although the significant decrease of the expression was shown at ten times more concentration of that physically observed, the allogeneic MLRs significantly decreased using the DCs derived from the culture containing progesterone at the concentration physically observed in blood during diestrus [3]. These results suggest that progesterone significantly inhibits the DC-maturation, but not the DC-differentiation. The inhibitory effect of progesterone on the maturation was also observed in mouse DC [9]. The immature DCs not only show weak in immune stimulation, but also induce immune tolerance [10]. In contrast to our results, Segere et al. reported that progesterone and estrogen did not effect on the maturation of dendritic cells derived from human monocytes [14]. However, in their study, hormones were added to the cultures where monocytes had differentiated into immature DCs (on day 4) and incubated with the immature DCs for only 24 hr. In our system, the hormones were added at the beginning of the culture and existed for 12 days. Thus, the discrepancy between their result and ours may be due to the difference of the experimental system. In the diestrus of the dog, the maximal level of progesterone on blood is maintained for 20-30 days, while the level of estrogen is kept very low [3]. Therefore, our system more reflects the hormone condition in the diestrus of the dog. Taken all evidences together, it is concluded that the inhibition of the DC-maturation by progesterone is a mechanism of the immune suppression in the diestrus, which indirectly induces the increased incidence of pyometra in the dog.
