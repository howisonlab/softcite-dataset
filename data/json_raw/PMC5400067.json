The aim of the ICDM model is to leverage HIV programme innovations to improve the quality of chronic disease care. There is a dearth of literature on the perspectives of healthcare providers and users on the quality of care in the novel ICDM model. This paper describes the viewpoints of operational managers and patients regarding quality of care in the ICDM model. In 2013, we conducted a case study of the seven PHC facilities in the rural Agincourt sub-district in northeast South Africa. Focus group discussions (n \u00bc 8) were used to obtain data from 56 purposively selected patients 18 years. In-depth interviews were conducted with operational managers of each facility and the sub-district health manager. Donabedian's structure, process and outcome theory for service quality evaluation underpinned the conceptual framework in this study. Qualitative data were analysed, with MAXQDA 2 software, to identify 17 a priori dimensions of care and unanticipated themes that emerged during the analysis. The manager and patient narratives showed the inadequacies in structure (malfunctioning blood pressure machines and staff shortage); process (irregular prepacking of drugs); and outcome (long waiting times). There was discordance between managers and patients regarding reasons for long patient waiting time which managers attributed to staff shortage and missed appointments, while patients ascribed it to late arrival of managers to the clinics. Patients reported anti-hypertension drug stock-outs (structure); sub-optimal defaulter-tracing (process); rigid clinic appointment system (process). Emerging themes showed that patients reported HIV stigmatisation in the community due to defaulter-tracing activities of home-based carers, while managers reported treatment of",

However, Avedis Donabedian's model has been used extensively in evaluating quality of healthcare and is regarded as a classic conceptual framework. Avedis Donabedian described seven elements of quality of medical care: efficacy, effectiveness, efficiency, equity, optimality, acceptability and legitimacy (Donabedian 2003). He argued that the choice and relative prioritization of these elements should be contextual and guided by the circumstances in which quality of care is assessed (Donabedian 2003). Donabedian described the quality assessment as a triad of structure, process, and outcome (SPO) constructs. He defined structure as the factors that affect the context in which care is provided (e.g. availability and functionality of equipment); process as the actions that make up healthcare (e.g. examination of patients); and outcome as the effects of healthcare on patients (e.g. waiting time). He postulated the relationships between SPO constructs based on the premise that good structure should promote good process, and good process should in turn promote good outcome. The SPO framework often represented by a chain of three boxes depicting the relationships between SPO constructs (Donabedian 2003) can be used to draw inferences about the quality of healthcare (Donabedian 1988a).",

The population under surveillance in July 2011 was 90 000 people in 16 000 households in 27 villages in which Tsonga is the most widely spoken language (Kahn et al. 2012). Government's development initiatives have led to improved housing and access to potable water, electricity and social security grants. However, infrastructure in the area is still limited and unemployment rates remain high (Kahn et al. 2007). All PHC health facilities in the Agincourt HDSS were selected for the study. Three referral public hospitals that serve these PHC health facilities are situated 25 km to 45 km from the study area (Kahn et al. 2007). These primary and secondary public health facilities serve socio-economically vulnerable populations in the study area.",

Considering the burden of chronic diseases in the study area, patients with markers of chronic diseases for HIV, hypertension, and diabetes in the health facilities were eligible to participate in the study. The criteria for recruiting patients for FGDs were i) having commenced treatment for the markers of chronic conditions in the study area six months before the implementation of the ICDM model; ii) having participated in the exit quantitative interviews organised by the research team before the FGDs and iii) willingness to participate. Participation in the exit quantitative interview was a criterion for recruiting patients for FGDs because the broader mixed methods research was designed for the quantitative and qualitative components to be conducted in series with the exit interviews preceding the FGDs. The purpose was to use the exit interviews as a means of identifying patients who overwhelmingly reported satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the quality of care in the priority areas of the ICDM model and purposively selecting these patients for FGDs to further explore their in-depth perspectives on the quality of care in the ICDM model. Patients receiving treatment six months before the ICDM model was implemented were selected to assess their levels of (dis)satisfaction with the quality of chronic disease care before and after the implementation of the ICDM model in efforts to gauge possible changes in the quality of chronic disease care that can be attributed to the ICDM model.",

Figure 2 shows the conceptual framework for this study. In this article, the relationships between structure, process and outcome constructs are non-predictive. The postulated relationships are thematically assessed using qualitative analytical techniques to generate recommendations for policy and practice. The conceptual framework indicates that, for instance, the provision of good structure (e.g. equipment and critical medicines) leads to a good process, (e.g. examination of patients) which in turn leads to good outcome (e.g. reduced waiting time).",

This was corroborated in the quantitative component of the broader study which showed suboptimal blood pressure (BP) control (Ameh et al. under review).

Most chronic diseases are presently managed in separate disease-specific public health facilities in South Africa (Oni et al. 2014) and suboptimal care has been reported for hypertension patients receiving treatment in these facilities (Steyn et al. 2008).

Therefore, financial constraint remains a barrier to accessing free services and treatment in public PHC facilities in South Africa. Other emerging themes were HIV stigmatization due to home visits by HBCs and use of traditional healers. Ill persons did not welcome HBCs into their homes because of the stigma attached to such visits which is often associated with chronic illness specifically HIV/ AIDS. These practices have been reported in the literature in an integrated HIV/TB programme elsewhere in South Africa (Uwimana et al. 2012). The reported HIV-related stigma in the communities is a barrier to accessing home-based health services and has the potential to negatively impact the effectiveness of the model in improving patients' health outcomes. Defaulter tracing was reportedly challenging because of combined use of PHC facilities and traditional healers in communities far away from where they received biomedical care. This pattern of health-related migration in the study setting has been attributed to the use of plural healing such as use of biomedicine, traditional healers, prophets and churches as viable alternatives for the treatment of stroke-like symptoms and other diseases (Thorogood et al. 2007). The use of traditional healers may interfere with pharmaceutical treatment which could result in poor health outcomes of patients.",

Patients who missed clinic appointments (process factor) felt nurses were unfriendly (process factor) to them during their subsequent clinic visit, and punished them by delaying their consultation process (outcome factor). These dynamics contributed to avoidable long waiting periods (outcome factor), aside from other health facility-related factors, such as the late arrival of staff; long morning prayer sessions before commencement of clinical duties; morning staff meetings; and prolonged tea/lunch breaks. Healthcare providers and users consistently reported long waiting periods in the health facilities as has been described in other resource-constrained LMICs (Babirye et al. 2014).
