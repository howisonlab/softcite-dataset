            "text": "Benin has witnessed almost unparalleled improvements in primary school attendance since 1990, yet remains virtually ignored in the literature surveying education outcomes in developing countries. The Gross Enrolment Rate (GER), defined as the number of students attending school as a percentage of the school age population, soared from around 50% to well over 100% between 1990 and 2012. 1 By 2012, the Net Enrolment Rate (NER), defined as the percentage of school age students attending school, stood at 95 percent (UIS 2017), well above the average in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) of just 77 percent. However, despite this impressive progress, severe geographical disparities persist in Benin's primary school attendance rates. According to the most recent Beninese Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 2012, there are still communes where less than one third of children attend. This study aims to shed light these disparities by assessing the relative importance of demand-(i.e. on the part of the student, or their family) and supply-side factors (i.e. availability of school facilities) on primary school attendance rates during the 2005-06 school year. 2 That is to say, I investigate whether some communes lag behind others due simply to a lack of schools, or whether other socioeconomic or sociocultural factors at the household level help to explain attendance rates.",

Therefore, this study also presents results from a multilevel logistic model, which accounts for unobserved heterogeneity between higher level clusters (i.e. at the household and commune level), in order to assess the level at which most variation in school attendance rates is seen. A three-level random intercepts model shows that there are a large number of communes with a significantly lower than average primary attendance rate, but that only around 11% of this variation is attributable to factors at the commune level. After controlling for both household and commune level factors, less than 5% of the variation in attendance is due to commune-level factors, suggesting that the majority of the between-commune variation in attendance rates is attributable to household-level characteristics. In a similar vein to Delprato and Sabates (2015), a random slopes model is also estimated, where the wealth coefficient is allowed to vary between communes. This identifies those communes where attendance is below average, but the effect of household wealth on school attendance is above average. Such results could potentially be of use to policymakers in identifying those areas where interventions that raised household wealth (or lowered the cost of schooling) might be most effective in increasing school attendance rates.",

Despite impressive progress in reducing the gender gap since 1990, the results presented herein suggest that the factors explaining girls' school attendance differ to those for boys. In particular, adopted girls and those that worked (either alongside or in place of attending school) were significantly less likely to attend school, whilst these variables were not significant explanatory factors for boys. At the same time, however, the results suggest that distance to school was not an important factor in girls' attendance. These results are explored further below.",

            "text": "Benin provides an intriguing case study in education and development. Along with an economic crisis that forced the closure of teacher training colleges and large scale cuts to the civil service in the 1980's, the socialist regime's failed attempts at reform (see Allen 1989) left Benin ranking amongst the worst performing countries in the world with regards primary school enrolment and gender parity; just 51 per cent of all children and less than one in four girls were attending primary school in 1990 (UIS 2017); the ODI (2011, 4) describes the education system at this time as 'deeply dysfunctional and inequitable'. However, the democratically elected government prioritised education in 1990 and as a result of systemic reform, Benin has seen almost unparalleled (at least in SSA) progress in terms of primary school enrolment rates. 3 Between 1990 and 2010, average adult years of education (Barro and Lee 2013) increased from 2.13 to 4.35 (only Mali saw a greater increase in the same period), gross and net enrollment soared and the gender gap was virtually eliminated in many regions. In October 2006, primary education was made free for all. Benin also performs well in terms of primary school availability. INSAE and Macro International (2007) report that in the 2005-06 school yearwhich is studied in detail below -93.7% of households lived within 4 km of a primary school; 79.1% lived less than 1 km away. Furthermore, there was relatively little difference between rural and urban areas, where 91.9 and 96.2% of households respectively resided within 4 km of the nearest primary school. Figure 1 plots Benin's progress in net primary school enrolment rates against the average for SSA, developing countries and the worlddespite missing data for many years, the trend is clear: NERs rose from around 40% (52% male, 27% female) in 1990 to 94% (99% male, 88% female) in 2012. 4 Gross primary enrolment rose from 51% to 123% in the same period. Progress in increasing enrolment of girls in primary school has been particularly impressive: The Gender Parity Index (GPI) rose from 0.50 in 1990 to 0.89 in 2012only Guinea matched this progress in SSA. 5 Yet these figures do not tell the whole story in Benin, as large regional disparities persist at both the department and commune level. To examine these, I turn to data from the 2006 wave of the DHS, where the ratio presented might best be defined as the Net Primary Attendance Rate as it shows the percentage of primary school age children whose parents reported that they were attending primary school in 2005-06. Some departments were still struggling with net primary attendance rates of as little as 29% (unweighted department average), whilst others saw rates of over 75%. The national average was 56%. Figure 2 shows net primary attendance (male and female combined) by commune in 2006. 6 It is clear that estimates of the net primary enrolment rate for, e.g. 2006 are somewhat higher than the net primary attendance rate. This is likely due to a number of factors. Firstly, measures of enrolment might include those children who enroll, but do not subsequently regularly attend school (see e.g. Omoeva et al. 2013). Secondly, there is evidence that over-reporting by public officials can lead to upward bias in enrolment statistics; Sandefur and Glassman (2015), for example report evidence of this in contexts such as Kenya or Rwanda, where pupil fees had been replaced by top-down per pupil grants, creating a financial incentive to inflate enrolment numbers. These explanations might well go some way to explaining the observed discrepancy between enrolment and attendance in Benin.",

Whilst the empirical analysis here does not specifically consider on-time-enrolment, a look at the age distribution of those attending primary school is nonetheless interesting. Figure 3 uses data from two waves of the DHS in order to highlight progress in the age distribution of primary school attendance in Benin between the 2005-06 and the 2011-12 school years. In 2011-12, the mode age of primary school attendees was 9 years old, at which over 75 percent of children were attending primary school, compared to 10 years old in 2005-06. Some of the most notable improvements come when looking to younger children: the earlier survey showed that, for example, just 35% of 6 year olds (the official starting age in Benin) were attending primary school in 2005-06; by 2011-12 this had risen to 61%. Thus, in addition to the increases in enrolment outlined above, there is also evidence of improvements in on-time enrolment. 8 3. Theoretical predictions and empirical evidence 3.1. Demand side Becker (1975, 45) argues that 'The most important single determinant of the amount invested in human capital may well be its profitability or rate of return.' In other words, it makes sense to invest in human capital, or in this case send a child to school, if the expected benefits outweigh the costs incurred. 9 Costs, of course, are measured in both direct and indirect termsthe former constitute items such as school fees, books, transport or uniforms, and the latter the opportunity cost of attending (Becker 1975). The opportunity cost of attending school is often higher in developing countries, where children commonly contribute to total household income through work. Children might make a direct contribution to household income, whereby the child works on the farm or in the marketplace, or an indirect contribution, where their help around the home or family business frees up the time of adults to earn more money (Colclough, Rose, and Tembon 2000). Such 'indirect contributions' are particularly pertinent for girls, who are more often required to assist with childcare etc. However, working and school attendance are rarely mutually exclusive in developing countries. Evidence from Burkina Faso (De Hoop and Rosati 2014), Kenya (Buchmann 2000) and Ethiopia (Admassie 2003) suggests that it is commonplace across Africa that children both work and attend school. Indeed, de Hoop and Rosati (ibid) found that the amount of time children in Burkina Faso spent working or helping with chores did not fall substantially (and in some cases even increased) even following the receipt of subsidies that reduced the cost of schooling. However, there is evidence that in rural areas, children enrolled at the start of the school year might be pulled out of school in order to help with the harvest in autumn Colclough, Rose, and Tembon (2000).",

Lincove (2012) or Huisman and Smits (2009) found distance to school to be inversely related with the likelihood of school attendance; Delprato and Sabates (2015), however, found no effects on the likelihood of late entry in Nigeria. 10 Turning to the benefits of attending primary school, these might not be immediately clear to parents or students in a developing country context. If there is a lack of job market opportunities in an area, then there will be a limited expected return to education. Even if opportunities were to arise in the future, parents might not reasonably be able to foresee this happening. If a child is expected to, for example, work on a family plot of land, then numeracy and literacy skills might well be of limited value, at least compared to the physical strength that he or she could have been building, which may prove more valuable for his or her future work. Similarly, Colclough, Rose, and Tembon (2000) highlight that in contexts where gender discrimination exists and the gender balance in labour markets is skewed in favour of males, that the benefits of education will be lower for girls. Thus, even with equitable access to schooling, there may still be significant challenges to convince parents of the benefits of educating daughters.",

Indeed, it is probable that these factors might be driven more by norms at the community or state level, than at the household level (Delprato and Sabates 2015). In societies where patriarchal norms persist, parents may place a higher value on the education of boys over girls. This often stems from the lack of social security or pension system, meaning that male children are expected to provide for their parents in old age; concurrently, it is common that daughters join their husband's family at marriage (Colclough, Rose, and Tembon 2000;Huisman and Smits 2009), and thus their own parents will realise no financial reward to their education. However, the findings of Eloundou-Enyegye and Calv\u00e8s (2006) provide a challenge to this traditional viewpoint: their study suggests that in some contexts, married women often remitted to their own families (e.g. in Cameroon) and that their capacity to do so actually increased, the more educated they were. Their study also notes the significant control that women in West Africa, and Benin in particular, have over their own earnings. 11 A further disadvantage for girls arises if the nearest school is quite far away; it might be that they are not allowed to attend until they are slightly older, due to the perceived dangers of walking alone, or physical effort of walking a long distance.",

Lincove (2015) found that Muslim children in Nigeria were, on average, 23% less likely to attend schoolbut the effect was more than double for girls (31%) than for boys (15%), a finding echoed by Kazeem, Jensen, and Stokes (2010) who found the same result for Nigeria, although the order of magnitude is dramatically largertheir regressions suggest that Muslim children were five times less likely to attend school than Christians. Lincove (2012), however, found no effect of being a Muslim on primary school attendance in Uganda and Buchmann 2000's regression results found that Muslim children were no less likely to attend school than their Christian counterparts in Kenya.

In terms of the economic rationale, this might allow the parent to better appreciate and estimate the benefits of education for their own child; this may be particularly true for girls if their mother has attained a certain level of education. 12 Various household or family level factors such as household size, birth order, whether or not a child is adopted, etc. might also be considered as explanatory factors with regards a child's likelihood of attending school. In terms of economic rationale, a larger number of children increases competition for limited household resources (Lincove 2015). As a result, it might be that children with more siblings cannot attend school as they are required to complete more tasks at home in order to contribute to household income and the direct costs of sending many children to school are obviously higher. At the same time however, a larger number of children might increase the likelihood that any one child can attend school as there are more hands to work and contribute to overall household income. Thus, the direction of this effect is, ex ante, unclear. Colclough, Rose, and Tembon 2000presents evidence that in Ethiopia, the average number of children in a household was higher for school attendees than for dropouts; Glick and Sahn (2006) found that as the number of children in a household increased, there was no impact on the likelihood that a child would attend a public primary school in Madagascar, although it did decrease the likelihood of a child attending private school. Similarly, Lincove (2015) found no effect of the number of children in a household in Uganda and only marginally significant effects for girls in Nigeria.",

However, considering only factors on the demand side ignores many of the considerations that a parent might make. Including estimates of the supply of schooling is crucial to avoid omitted variable bias when carrying out empirical analyses of school attendance. Often, however, institutional data for the total number of schools, pupil teacher ratios (PTR) etc., is only available at the national or regional level, making consolidation with survey data at the community or village very level difficult. As a result, many studies fail to accurately account for the supply of schooling. 13 School quality is often measured by the PTR, although this variable is clearly endogenous in regressions where the dependent variable is school attendance rates. Other variables that have been used to represent school quality include the percentage of teachers who are qualified (e.g. Lavy 1996;Huisman and Smits 2009), percentage of teachers who are female (often considered key in explaining girls' participation in education e.g. Glick 2008;Huisman and Smits 2009) the use of multigrade teaching (Glick and Sahn 2006) and the condition of classrooms etc. However, the effect of these variables on primary school attendance is mixed and it is not unreasonable to argue that some of these measures might matter more for explaining school achievement than attendance.",

Control variables are included at the individual, household and commune level; Table 1 presents summary statistics of these. Just under half of the sample was female (48%), 3.5% were adopted and it appears common that children of school age also work; some 73% did so. 15 With regard to those children who were adopted, the definition reveals that they are in 'foster care' and not related to any other household member; 89% of their mothers and 77% of their fathers were still known to be alive; fewer than 4% had lost both parents. It is thus difficult to speculate on the reasons for adoption, but one reason could be due to infertility of adoptive parents: DHS (2004b), suggests that in Benin, 61% of primarily sterile women reside in a household with at least one adopted child (compared to 38% of primarily fertile women), the highest in the sample of 48 developing countries considered. Indeed, in the West African region, the study found that more than half of childless couples lived in a household with an adopted child. An alternative explanation is that children are adopted principally to help out with work around the house. Adopted girls, for example, were more likely to carry out domestic work (78%) than biological daughters (64%) and less likely to attend primary school conditional on also carrying out this type of work (29% v 58% for adoptees and biological daughters respectively). There was no significant difference between adopted sons and biological sons in terms of work (70% and 71% did, respectively).",

However, this is perhaps the best approximation available, given the data on hand. 19  Table 2 presents benchmark results for equation (1). In all following tables, the dependent variable is as outlined above. It can be considered a close approximation to the NER, although is again perhaps best defined as a net primary attendance rate. The Log-odds ratio is shown, along with average marginal effects (the latter in square brackets). 20 Both are included, as the log odds are more comparable with the multilevel results later (as it is not possible to obtain marginal effects following that procedure) whilst the marginal effects are somewhat more intuitive and help to give a sense of the magnitude of the effects of the covariates. 21 Column 1 includes the entire sample, whilst columns 2 and 3 perform the same regression for boys and girls respectively. Looking first at the individual level factors, the likelihood of attending primary school is significantly lower for girls than it is for boys: this is in line with expectations, given the considerable gender disparities that exist(ed) in enrolment at primary school for Benin's young girls. Specifically, the results suggest that girls aged 6-11 were around 9% less likely to attend primary school than are boys. Age and its square suggest a non-linear relationship with the dependent variable, reflecting the pattern outlined in Figure 3 above. The results also suggest that adopted children are less likely to attend school than those related to the family; in a context where income might be low it is understandable that households might give preference to the education of biological children. Interestingly, however, column three highlights that the significance of this variable comes entirely from girls who are around 20% less likely to be enrolled in school than a biological daughter; adopted sons appear to face no such disadvantage compared to biological ones. Further inquiry showed that of four types of child (biological son, biological daughter, adopted son and adopted daughter), adopted daughters were the least likely of any to attend school, even when compared to adopted sons. 22 An alternative way to frame this inquiry is to include an interaction term ( female * adopted) in the full sample. When tested, this yielded an identical result, with a similar marginal effect (0.19). Lincove (2012) found a similar result in Uganda, however her results actually showed a larger impact for fostered boys than fostered girlsthe opposite of what is presented here, whilst Huisman and Smits (2009) found an overall negative effect on the likelihood of foster children attending school in their panel of 30 developing countries. Worked is a dummy variable equal to 1 if children in the sample carried out any kind of work alongside studying. Again, girls appear to be at a disadvantage compared to boys, with the likelihood of being in school 5% lower for those girls who worked, compared to those who did not. 23 This is explored in more detail below.",

The DHS surveys also inquired as to the ethnicity of individuals, however this was often closely correlated to religion and did not provide any additional insights when tested in the model (not shown). It is clear that as household wealth increases, so too does the likelihood that children attend primary school. For instance, those in the lowest wealth quintile were some 29% less likely to attend school than those in the richest (the reference category). This echoes results in studies such as Huisman and Smits (2009), or Delprato and Sabates (2015) (Nigeria), which also found an increasing likelihood of school attendance as household wealth level increased, although Lincove (2012) found no effects of household wealth on primary school attendance in Uganda. The effects of household wealth again suggest some difference by gender: girls from the poorest households face a slightly lower disadvantage to boys, compared to the upper quintile, perhaps a reflection of the higher value placed on boys' work. This is explored in more detail below. Similarly, household heads that had attended primary or secondary school were more likely to send their own children to primary school than those with no education (the reference category); there is little difference here by gender. Obviously, it might be the case that richer families are often more educated, or it might be the case that Christian families are more likely to be wealthier (reside in wealthier regions, etc.). In order to investigate, Tables 3 and 4 display the predictive margins of being in a Christian home by wealth level and the predictive margins of having a more educated household head by wealth level respectively.",

In particular, children of Christian parents are consistently around 5-6% more likely to attend school, regardless of household wealth level. Turning to Table 4, again it is clear that holding wealth constant, the likelihood that a child is sent to school is greater for those household heads with primary, compared to no, education and greater for those with secondary compared to primary education. Interestingly, holding wealth level fixed, the household head having a tertiary education does not increase the probability that a child will attend school compared to a secondary level education. Potential explanations for this finding are (i) Secondary education may be sufficient for a household head to obtain a job that pays well enough to cover the costs (both direct and indirect) of schooling so that most or all children in their household can attend, or (ii) Anyone capable of completing secondary school already fully understands the benefits of sending a child to at least primary school; it does not require a tertiary education to appreciate this. 25 Looking at the commune-averaged variables in Table 2, male children in rural areas are less likely to be enrolled than males in urban areas; it also seems that distance to school matters only for boys. This result emerges in direct conflict to the thinking that parents will be less likely to send their female children to school because of the long distance to walk, fear of attack etc. The supply of schools is however importantthe variable Schools per 5-14 year olds reflects the number of schools in a given commune, divided by the population aged 5-14 years. The positive and significant coefficient on this variable for children of both genders suggests that having controlled for demand-side factors, school availability also matters for primary attendance rates. However, these results warrant closer inspection; due to the relatively high correlation between average distance to school and number of schools (\u22120.57), the effects of these variables are examined in isolation. The results in columns 4 and 6 suggest that both distance and the number of schools respectively appear to affect the likelihood that a child is enrolled. However, when interacted with the rural dummy (columns 5 and 7), it appears that neither distance to school nor the number of schools have a stronger effect in rural areas, although the signs are in the expected direction. As a further check on the role of distance to school, columns 8 and 9 investigate the extent to which this variable can shed light on the opportunity cost of primary school attendance by subdividing the sample by gender and examining the interaction of distance to school and whether or not a child worked. 26 There is no significant effect of distance on girls' attendance if they worked (column 9), however the result for boys presents evidence that the distance to school is an important concern for those that worked alongside studying (column 8). The negative and significant coefficient on the interaction term suggests that boys who worked alongside studying were even less likely to attend a school the further away it was, compared to those who did not work. This lends supports to the hypothesis that the opportunity cost of schooling is taken into account when deciding whether or not to send a child to school. Indeed, it suggests that the opportunity cost of sending boys to school was higher than girls. Table 5 investigates the role of work further, examining the effect of distance to school on the likelihood that a child attends school, according to gender and the type of work carried out. The sample is subdivided by those who 'worked in the field' and those carrying out 'domestic work'. 27 The results show that those working in the field faced the greatest opportunity cost to attending school; an increase in average distance to school of 1 km reduced the likelihood that boys (girls) would attend by around 8% (4%). We also see that distance is a significant determinant of primary school attendance for boys who carried out domestic work, but not girls. A number of explanations for the differences observed between genders might be considered: Firstly, boys' labour, or the nature of their labour, may contribute more to family income than girls' and so the opportunity costs of travel time are more heavily felt. Indeed, of those children carrying out 'work in the field', 68% were boys; conversely, only 37% of children that carried out 'domestic work' were boys. The significant coefficient on distance for those boys carrying out domestic work suggests that the nature of this work might differ between gendersand that the domestic tasks carried out by boys was more valuable to the household. Secondly, the climate in Benin at that time, of promoting primary school enrolment for all, might have seen parents under pressure to (be seen to) send daughters to school, so even those required to work were encouraged to attend to a greater extent than were sons. This result complements the findings of, for example, Colclough, Rose, and Tembon (2000) who found that boys in both Guinea and Ethiopia that had dropped out of school did so primarily to earn money. Although, Buchmann (2000) found that from a sample of 146 children who had dropped out of school in Kenya, only one did so for employment and one to help in the household. ",

Figure 3 showed that many children in primary school in 2005-06 fell outside the official age category of 6-11. Furthermore, related studies in this field have imposed different criteria for classifying primary school attendance status: Huisman and Smits (2009) consider only those aged 8-11 in a panel of 30 countries; Lincove (2015), those aged 6-13 in Nigeria and Uganda (although crucially, omit any children that had already progressed to secondary school); Buchmann (2000) those aged 13-18 in Kenya; Lincove (2012), those aged 6-12 years old in Uganda. To the best of my knowledge, only Deininger (2003) provides estimates for a number of alternative age ranges (Uganda). Whilst some of this disparity in the choice of dependent variable naturally results from different official starting ages and length of school cycles in each country, it can hamper the comparability of results across studies and across countries. An appealing approach is outlined in Omoeva et al. (2013), who argue in favour of classing the school age as between 7 and 14 years old and abandoning the arbitrary definitions of 'primary' or 'secondary'. These bounds are influenced by the fact that ' \u2026 in all countries, compulsory education begins by age 7 or earlier' and ' \u2026 the ILO minimum age convention establishes age 15 as the minimum legal age for entering any form of employment \u2026 ' (Omoeva et al. 2013, 48). As a result, any child falling within this age bracket should be expected to be in school. To follow this definition for the Beninese sample would lead to the loss of those children aged 5 or 6 who are, by all accounts, of school age. However, by extending the upper age range of the sample to 14, the analysis can account for many more children attending, or who have completed, primary school. In the robustness checks included in Appendix A, the dependent variable is thus a dummy equal to 1 if (i) a child is aged between 5 and 14 and (ii) (s)he is in, or has completed, primary school. 28 All of the previously reported results hold using this alternative dependent variable; the only differences arising are small changes in the magnitude of certain independent variables.",

As shown in section 2, stark regional disparities exist Benin with regards to primary school attendance rates. Whilst a number of studies acknowledge that factors at the household, community or district level might impact on school attendance in SSA (for example Lavy [1996];  or Huisman and Smits [2009]), only Delprato and Sabates (2015) have explicitly modelled this econometrically by taking account of unobserved heterogeneity between higher level clusters. However, their study focused on late entry as opposed to primary attendance. The consequence for the econometric analysis of ignoring this is a violation of the assumption that observations are independent from one another; unobserved heterogeneity at higher levels leads to cluster-level interdependence between units (Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh 2004). The traditional approach to dealing with such data is to turn to a multilevel (or hierarchical) linear model (MLM) (HLM), the simplest of which is the random-intercepts or variance components model which estimates a random intercept for every higher-level unit, such as commune or department etc.",

The models here are computedsing second-order penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL2) in MLwiN (Rasbash et al. 2015) via the Stata module runmlwin (Leckie and Charlton 2013). When selecting the appropriate means by which to estimate multilevel equations, it is necessary to choose a method at is both the most unbiased, but also computationally feasible. Simulations in Rodriguez and Goldman (2001) show that 2nd order Penalised Quasi Likelihood (PQL) estimation provided the closest approximation to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), out of the choice of 1st and 2nd order marginal quasi-likelihood (MQL) and 1st and 2nd order PQL. Whilst, ideally, MLE would be used to obtain all the estimates, this is computationally very intensive for models beyond the null; Stata's commands such as xtmelogit often take many hours or days to converge, if at all. Appendix B displays estimates of the variance of the random effects in equation 3using MQL1, MQL2, PQL1, PQL2 and MLE; Whilst there is still a downward bias in the estimates of s 2 m and s 2 w compared to MLE, PQL2 performs substantially better than the other quasi-likelihood estimators.

Interestingly, the average household wealth level of the 33 communes lying in this quadrant is below the national average. 33 This suggests that, by and large, interventions or policies that increased household income in the poorest communes nationally could see large increases in primary school attendance rates. 34 The analysis of section 5 suggests that by lowering average distance to school (by building more schools, improving the road network etc.), this might free up time for boys to work (and as such contribute to family income) alongside studying, thus lowering the opportunity cost of attending school.

These results have presented numerous insights. Large regional disparities existed during the year of study  and indeed, still do, in the most recent DHS data (2011-12). The empirical analysis has presented evidence that factors on both the demand and supply side are predictors of whether or not a child will be enrolled in school. Richer households, those following a Christian religion and those with more educated household heads were more likely to send their children to school. Despite the narrowing gender gap in Benin at the time, girls still faced a lower likelihood of attending school than boys; adopted girls seemed at the greatest disadvantage. Focusing on the role of child labour, the empirical results highlight that those boys that worked alongside studying faced a higher opportunity cost of travel time to school than girls. In particular, it appears that distance to school mattered more for boys who worked in the field than those carrying out domestic work and that distance was only a significant determinant for those girls who worked in the field. In so far as working in the field generated more income for the household than did domestic work, then these results might be taken as an indication that distance to school goes some way to capturing the opportunity cost of attending.",

In attempting to shed light on the large regional disparities that exist in Beninese primary school attendance, the present work explicitly accounts for higher level variation in school attendance by using a multilevel modelling strategy. A three-level random intercepts model, estimated at the individual, household and commune level, highlighted that there were a number of communes where primary school attendance was significantly lower than average. After controlling for individual, household and commune-level factors, the model is able to explain a large portion of the betweencommune variance in primary attendance rates. However, it also suggests that much of the residual variance in primary school attendance between communes is actually due to factors at the household level. A random slopes model suggests a number of communes where primary school attendance is below average and the effect of household wealth on attendance is above average. Such regions might stand to benefit most, in terms of primary school attendance rates, from government policies that raised household incomes, or reduced the costs of schooling.",

Results not shown, but available upon request 23. The results of a logit model where female and worked were interacted revealed a similar result (not shown), with the AME around \u22125%. 24. The 'Christian' category includes 'Protestant', 'Catholic', 'Celeste' & 'Other Christian. 25. It might also be the case that the sample of heads with tertiary education is simply too small to accurately capture the effect. Only 300 children lived in a household with such a head, out of the sample of 17,094. 26. No significant differences were uncovered here when differentiating between rural and urban, or when including the 'Number of Schools' variable. 27. The types of work considered are 'work in the field' and 'domestic work'. These categories represent 50 and 44% of the respondents, whilst the vast majority of the remaining children were categorised as \"other\". 28. Thus, children currently in secondary school and those who have completed primary school but not gone on to secondary education are also included. 29. This judgement was made on the basis of LR-test statistics. 30. Initial diagnostics deemed that the computational complexity of adding a department level to the model in Table  6 led to little gain in model performance. As such it was not included, but the graphical insight here is nonetheless useful. 31. In the multilevel models here, mean-centred wealth is included rather than the individual wealth quintiles, allowing estimation of the random slopes model, below. 32. This was deemed the most policy-relevant variable to focus on in this section. That is, the results help us to identify those communes where interventions that raised household wealth (or reduced the costs of schooling) would be most productive in increasing primary school attendance. It could have focused on, for example, household head's education level, but as that variable measures past educational attainment (and not something like literacy or numeracy), it is more difficult to envisage an appropriate policy response to influence this. 33. 23 of 33 had mean wealth levels below the national average. 34. Of course, any increases in attendance may potentially be limited by the availability of schools, teachers or supplies. However, such considerations are beyond the scope of the current analysis and, indeed, could not be investigated with the data at hand.",
