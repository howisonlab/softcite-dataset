The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of preoperative CRP in patients with SCCE. Methods: From January 2001 to December 2010, a retrospective analysis of 43 consecutive patients with SCCE was conducted. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic parameters. Results: In our study, elevated CRP levels (.10 mg/L) were found in 16 patients (37.2%). CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with deeply invasive tumors (P = 0.018) and those associated with nodal metastasis (P = 0.018). Patients with CRP #10 mg/L had a significantly better overall survival than patients with CRP .10 mg/L (25.9% vs 6.3%, P = 0.004). Multivariate analyses showed that CRP was a significant predictor for overall survival. CRP .10 mg/L had a hazard ratio of 2.756 (95% confidence interval: 1.115-6.813, P = 0.028) for overall survival. Conclusion: Preoperative CRP is an independent predictive factor for long-term survival in patients with SCCE."

The Pearson Chi-squared test was used to determine the significance of differences between the two groups. The overall cumulative probability of survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference was assessed by the log-rank test. A univariate analysis was used to examine the association between various prognostic predictors and survival. Possible prognostic factors associated with overall survival were considered in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (Enter). Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to quantify the strength of the association between predictors and survival.

We therefore propose pretreatment CRP as a useful adjunct that can be associated in routine practice with pretreatment screening in patients with SCCE."
