The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of preoperative CRP in patients with SCCE. Methods: From January 2001 to December 2010, a retrospective analysis of 43 consecutive patients with SCCE was conducted. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic parameters. Results: In our study, elevated CRP levels (.10 mg/L) were found in 16 patients (37.2%). CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with deeply invasive tumors (P = 0.018) and those associated with nodal metastasis (P = 0.018). Patients with CRP #10 mg/L had a significantly better overall survival than patients with CRP .10 mg/L (25.9% vs 6.3%, P = 0.004). Multivariate analyses showed that CRP was a significant predictor for overall survival. CRP .10 mg/L had a hazard ratio of 2.756 (95% confidence interval: 1.115-6.813, P = 0.028) for overall survival. Conclusion: Preoperative CRP is an independent predictive factor for long-term survival in patients with SCCE.",

The Pearson Chi-squared test was used to determine the significance of differences between the two groups. The overall cumulative probability of survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference was assessed by the log-rank test. A univariate analysis was used to examine the association between various prognostic predictors and survival. Possible prognostic factors associated with overall survival were considered in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (Enter). Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to quantify the strength of the association between predictors and survival.

The cytokines interact with the immunovascular system and facilitate growth, invasion, and metastasis. 4,5 Recent studies have shown that elevated preoperative serum CRP levels may be associated with tumor size, depth of invasion, and nodal metastasis, resulting in poor prognosis in patients with various cancers, including EC. 6,7,9 Thus, in our study, we wanted to determine whether preoperative CRP level is associated with overall survival after esophagectomy for SCCE.",

            "text": "The reasons why CRP levels can be correlated with prognosis in cancer patients remain to be determined. Any explanation of accumulating data showing that serum CRP is involved in host defenses against infections as highlighted by murine transgenic models must be speculative. [15][16][17] As with other proteic markers of acute inflammation, CRP has several biological functions including complement activation through the classical pathway, opsonization, leukocyte chemotactism, and platelet activation. 18,19 The potential limitations of the present study include the relatively small number of patients, as well as the fact that the analysis was retrospective, and the short mean follow-up duration. Furthermore, due to the limited number of patients with SCCE, our analysis may suffer from type I or model, we demonstrated that CRP (HR: 2.756, 95% CI: 1.115-6.813, P = 0.028), and chemoradiotherapy (HR: 0.294, 95% CI: 0.129-0.673, P = 0.004) were independent prognostic factors ( Table 3). In addition, patients with CRP #10 mg/L had a significantly better overall survival than patients with CRP .10 mg/L (25.9% vs 6.3%, P = 0.004) (Figure 1).",
