Methods A cohort of white and black men and women autoworkers in the USA was followed from 1941 to 1995 with quantitative exposure to respirable particulate matter from water-based metalworking fluids. Separate analyses used proportional hazards models and g-estimation. Results The HR for IHD among black men was 3.29 (95% CI 1.49 to 7.31) in the highest category of cumulative synthetic fluid exposure. The HR for IHD among white women exposed to soluble fluid reached 2.44 (95% CI 0.96 to 6.22). However, no increased risk was observed among white men until we corrected for the healthy worker survivor effect. Results from g-estimation indicate that if white male cases exposed to soluble or synthetic fluid had been unexposed to that fluid type, then 1.59 and 1.20 years of life would have been saved on average, respectively. Conclusions We leveraged the strengths of two different analytic approaches to examine the IHD risks of metalworking fluids. All workers may have the same aetiological risk; however, black and female workers may experience more IHD from water-based metalworking fluid exposure because of a steeper exposure-response or weaker healthy worker survivor effect."

The sparse evidence that occupational PM exposure increases the risk of heart disease mortality derives mostly from studies of industrial cohorts of white men. 5 Blacks and women may have greater exposure to occupational hazards in the USA, 6 so an understanding of the impact of occupational exposures by race and gender may help lead to better protections.",

The bias arises if less healthy workers reduce exposure or self-select out of the work force earlier than their healthier counterparts. The healthy worker survivor effect has been studied mostly in the context of white, male cohorts; however, the likelihood of self-selection out of employment may well vary by race and gender. 7 We assess disparities in ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and the healthy worker survivor effect using the United Autoworkers General Motors cohort-a large cohort of white and black men and women with individual-level, quantitative metalworking fluid exposure. Metalworking fluids are widely used in machining operations as coolants and lubricants during cutting or grinding operations. We report survival analyses of PM 3.5 (PM <3.5 \u03bcm in diameter) generated by metalworking fluid on IHD mortality by race and gender. In addition to proportional hazards models, we use g-estimation of accelerated failure time models to adjust for the healthy worker survivor effect and compare the relative impact of the bias by race and gender.",

For jobs with mixed exposures, we estimated the percentage of time spent using each type of fluid. Scale factors were estimated to rank aerosol exposures relative to the baseline levels (1984).

Under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, counterfactual outcomes are conditionally independent of observed exposures, within strata of the measured covariates.

The analysis therefore concerns duration of exposure rather than cumulative exposure. Probability of exposure among the actively employed was predicted in a pooled logistic model on the basis of age, decade, plant, history of time off work and prior exposure to each fluid type; results are thus 'adjusted' for those variables. Also included in the exposure model was the maximum follow-up time possible for that worker (a variable required by g-estimation). Censoring (administrative, loss to follow-up, competing risks) was handled as described in Chevrier et al. 13 We stratified by race and gender, and ran separate analyses.

Black men and white women had increased risk of IHD with increased exposure to at least one type of metalworking fluid, however no increased risk was observed among white men. We did, however, observe increased risk among white men after correcting for the healthy worker survivor effect using g-estimation. The healthy worker survivor effect arises when susceptible workers leave work or transfer to lower exposed jobs; an option that may be more available to white, male workers. 14 Thus, results from the proportional hazards models seem to have been most dramatically attenuated by the healthy worker survivor bias for white men. All workers appear to be at increased risk of IHD with increased exposure; however, g-estimation was needed to observe the effect among white male autoworkers."

These methods, however, answer different questions: the standard proportional hazards model estimates the conditional effect of cumulative, quantitative exposure on the hazard of IHD on the multiplicative scale while the accelerated failure time model estimates the marginal effect of duration of exposure on survival time on the additive scale. Each method has strengths and weaknesses. The primary strength of the standard model is being able to handle quantitative exposure in a familiar way; however, the model cannot address healthy worker survivor effect. G-estimation of the accelerated failure time, on the other hand, removes the healthy worker survivor bias but sacrifices the quantitative exposure information. In addition, g-estimation appears to have power limitations in the smaller strata. We do not expect either model alone to give the definitive answer, but rather combine the strengths of each to provide a more complete assessment."

Effect measure modification depends on the measure of effect, so finding evidence of disparities in the proportional hazard, but not accelerated failure time, models is not necessarily in conflict. Our results are consistent with disparities in the exposure-response or with disparities only in the healthy worker survivor effect. We discuss these possibilities in light of the occupational and social literature."

In fact, if black and female autoworkers do not opt out of the work force for health-related reasons, then there is no time-varying confounding affected by prior exposure and the proportional hazards model may provide an unbiased estimate of IHD risk in these subgroups. We cannot test this assumption directly, as we do not have a measure of time-varying health status.

In a different publication, we demonstrated that g-estimation resulted in higher HRs for IHD in relation to straight metalworking fluid, as well as several other mortality outcomes, compared to proportional hazards models. 13 However, the use of straight metalworking fluids has been phased out in most industries, thus our current focus is on the health effects of water-based fluids.",

We used a multiple imputation procedure to impute missing smoking information for the black men in this study. Sensitivity analyses (not shown) using imputed smoking information did not change the result for IHD and synthetic exposure; however, we doubt the validity of extrapolating smoking information on current workers in 1985 to workers in the 1940s.

Although most of these workers were likely white, those who were black were never included in their correct stratum for this analysis. Excluding black workers with missing race status from the black stratum is a form of left truncation bias, since they would have been correctly classified as black had they stayed at work until the electronic employment record system was implemented. Left truncation bias can attenuate the observed association between exposure and disease because those who stay for longer are more heavily exposed and are less susceptible to the exposure-response association. 43 Missing race status is a limitation in this analysis and may have attenuated the observed associations for black men. However, only 10% of the workers were missing information on race.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first time the association between occupational exposure to PM 3.5 and IHD mortality has been reported by race and gender from a single cohort. Additionally, this is the first time g-estimation has been applied to understand the race and gender differences in the healthy worker survivor effect. We were able to leverage the strengths of two different analytic approaches to shed light on the health risks of metalworking fluids among autoworkers. We found that black men and white women had increased risk of IHD with increased exposure to at least one of the two types of water-based metalworking fluids, however no increased risk was observed among white men when using proportional hazard models to estimate risk. We did, however, observe increased risk among white men after correcting for the healthy worker survivor effect, which suggests that the aetiological effect of water-based metalworking may be the same in all subsets of our population. Alternatively, black and female workers may experience more IHD from waterbased metalworking fluid exposure either because of steeper exposure-response or weaker healthy worker survivor effect."
