            "text": "In a non-model staple crop like wheat (Triticum aestivumI L.), functional validation of potential drought stress responsive genes identified in Arabidopsis could provide gene targets for breeding. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of genes of interest can overcome the inherent problems of polyploidy and limited transformation potential that hamper functional validation studies in wheat. In this study, three potential candidate genes shown to be involved in abiotic stress response pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana were selected for VIGS experiments in wheat. These include Era1 (enhanced response to abscisic acid), Cyp707a (ABA 8'-hydroxylase), and Sal1 (inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase). Gene homologues for these three genes were identified in wheat and cloned in the viral vector barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) in the antisense direction, followed by rub inoculation of BSMV viral RNA transcripts onto wheat plants. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that VIGS-treated wheat plants had significant reductions in target gene transcripts. When VIGS-treated plants generated for Era1 and Sal1 were subjected to limiting water conditions, they showed increased relative water content, improved water use efficiency, reduced gas exchange, and better vigour compared to water-stressed control plants inoculated with RNA from the empty viral vector (BSMV 0). In comparison, the Cyp707a-silenced plants showed no improvement over BSMV 0-inoculated plants under limited water condition. These results indicate that Era1 and Sal1 play important roles in conferring drought tolerance in wheat. Other traits affected by Era1 silencing were also studied. Delayed seed germination in Era1-silenced plants suggests this gene may be a useful target for developing resistance to pre-harvest sprouting.",

            "text": "Drought is a major problem that affects wheat production worldwide. Tolerance to water stress is a quantitative trait with a complex phenotype that is often confounded by plant phenology (Fleury et al., 2010). Because of the complexity of water stress tolerance and the effect of other harsh environmental factors in the field, improvement of this trait has largely relied on direct phenotypic selection for improved performance under drought conditions. On the other hand, the application of genomic tools in Arabidopsis has produced large datasets of gene expression profiles that result from exposure to water stress (Seki et al., 2001). Experimental validation of candidate genes identified from such transcript profiling studies has identified genes that appear to contribute to plant performance under limiting water conditions in greenhouse studies. Two such genes are Era1 and Cyp707a, which are both involved in abscisic acid (ABA) regulation in the abiotic stress pathway. Era1 is a gene that encodes the \u03b2-subunit of farnesyltransferase (Cutler et al., 1996), whose loss of function in Arabidopsis thaliana caused greater ABAinduced guard cell S-type anion-channel activation and a rapid increase in the cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration. Era1 mutation resulted in significantly tighter stomatal closure at a wide range of physiologically relevant ABA concentrations (Pei et al., 1998;Allen et al., 2002). Transgenic Brassica napus silenced for Era1 showed enhanced ABA sensitivity as well as significant reduction in stomatal conductance and water transpiration under drought stress conditions (Wang et al., 2005). Cyp707a is a catabolic gene encoding ABA 8'-hydroxylase, an enzyme playing a key role in ABA catabolism and in controlling ABA levels in various aspects of the plant life cycle (Kushiro et al., 2004). The Cyp707a gene reportedly degrades ABA during seed imbibition and dehydration stress (Kushiro et al., 2004;Saito et al., 2004). A T-DNA insertion mutant of Cyp707a3, which is the most abundantly expressed gene among the four Cyp707a members under stress conditions, exhibited elevated drought tolerance with a concomitant reduction in transpiration rate (Umezawa et al., 2006). A third gene is Sal1, an inositol polyphosphate1-phosphatase-encoding gene. Sal1 was originally isolated from Arabidopsis for its ability to complement a salt-sensitive yeast strain (Quintero et al., 1996). In Arabidopsis, mutation of this gene has shown increased drought tolerance (Wilson et al., 2009). Sal1 acts as a negative regulator of predominantly ABA-independent and also ABA-dependent stress response pathways. As far as is known, none of these three genes have been experimentally proven to have a role in drought tolerance in wheat. Furthermore, wheat homologues for Sal1 have not been identified prior to this study.",

The high frequencies of duplication and deletion events in the wheat genome make it difficult to predict the function of a gene in one species based on the function of the homologous gene in the other species (Dubcovsky and Dvorak, 2007). Furthermore, it has been shown that while common regulatory mechanisms exist across species in response to abiotic stress, the conservation of the molecular response to dehydration across experiments (Mohammadi et al., 2007;Aprile et al., 2009) is low due to variation in stress dynamics, stage of development and tissue analysed.",

For gene overexpression studies, full-length sequence information and an efficient genetic transformation protocol are required. However, wheat has been the most recalcitrant cereal species to culture in vitro (Shah et al., 2009). Transformation in wheat is still confined mainly to a few responsive varieties with quite different transformation frequencies such as the model spring genotype 'Bobwhite' (Cheng et al., 1997(Cheng et al., , 2003Hu et al., 2003). For downregulation studies, knockout mutants are used. Not only will this require a transformation step, but the functional redundancy of homeologous genes present in the other wheat genomes could complement the absence of gene expression resulting from a single gene knockout (Lawrence and Pikaard, 2003). This limitation can be overcome by generating double and triple mutants, although this process is cumbersome and time consuming. Therefore, faster alternatives are required for functional gene analysis in polyploid wheat.",

For identification of Sal1 sequences in wheat, annotated Arabidopsis Sal1 (TAIR accession 4010745380) sequences were screened against publicly available wheat expressed sequence tag sequences (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/wEST/) which were then assembled into one contig using CAP3 at a stringency level of 95% similarity over a 20-bp overlap (Huang and Madan, 1999). The assembled sequences were validated by PCR amplification of wheat cDNA followed by sequencing, resulting in a 1077-bp region. A PCR product of 275 bp was generated from this 1077 bp using primers listed in Table1.",

Cyp707a is involved in the catabolism of ABA and also has the potential to regulate stomatal response under drought (Umezawa et al., 2006). The present study therefore tested whether and how the rate of gas exchange would be affected by silencing of these genes. Water-stressed BSMV 0 -treated plants and non-silenced WS plants did not show statistically significant differences in stomatal conductance and transpiration rate (Fig. 2). The water-stressed BSMV Era1 -and BSMV Sal1 -treated lines showed statistically significant reductions in stomatal conductance and transpiration rate under limiting water conditions compared to the water-stressed viral control plants at both 7 and 14 dpi. This is consistent with previous reports of reduced stomatal conductance in loss-of-function mutants in Arabidopsis (Pei et al., 1998;Rossel et al., 2004;Wilson et al., 2009). These loss-of-function mutant plants also showed increased tolerance in drought stress conditions in greenhouse experiments. At 14 dpi, the transpiration level of BSMV Sal1 -treated plants showed further reduction in stomatal conductance relative to that at 7 dpi. A slight reduction was also observed in BSMV Era1 -treated plants at 14 dpi compared to 7 dpi (Fig. 2). On the other hand, BSMV Cyp707a -treated plants did not show a significant reduction in stomatal conductance compared to viral control plants. Photosynthesis measurements taken during this study were inconclusive due to the total shut down of photosynthesis across all water-stressed treatment groups.",

The RWC and WUE measurements indicate potential photosynthetic gain during a water stress period. The WUE values obtained were lower than typically observed in potted plants (usually in the range 0.6-0.9 g kg -1 ). This is most likely a result of the plants not getting sufficient light in the greenhouse during the winter when these experiments were carried out. This would have resulted in reduced photosynthesis and consequently low biomass gain. However, since all plants were grown under the same conditions, it was possible to compare plants in the different treatments. The non-silenced plants showed a drastic reduction in both WUE and RWC in the WS plants relative to the WW plants, which was expected. The WS plants also did not differ significantly from the water-stressed viral control, indicating that virus inoculation had no effect on these two measurements. Similarly, plants silenced for Cyp707a did not differ significantly from the viral control in both WUE and RWC. On the other hand, plants silenced for Era1 and Sal1 showed significant gains in RWC and WUE over viral control and WS plants. Gene expression values were standardized across six independent biological replicates with three technical replicates. Expression of Era1 (A), Sal1 (B), and Cyp707a (C) in well-watered non-silenced (WW), water-stressed non-silenced (WS), and silenced plants (denoted by the gene name) at 11 dpi were calibrated to the mean level of expression of the respective gene in the water-stressed BSMV 0 -treated plants.",

Interestingly, more tillers were observed in BSMV Sal1 -treated plants compared to plants in all other treatments, including BSMV Era1 -treated plants.

Seeds harvested from plants inoculated with BSMV Era1 at the booting stage were tested for germination capacity. As Fig. 5A shows, the earliest germination of Era1-silenced seeds occurred 6 days later than those of control (BSMV 0 treated) plants, 6-8 days after 100% of seeds from control plants have germinated, only 60% of seeds from Era1-silenced plants had germinated, and 100% germination was achieved 10 days later than those of control plants. Goritschnig et al. (2008) recently showed that loss of function in Arabidopsis results in enhanced susceptibility to virulent bacterial and oomycete pathogens. This led the authors to suggest that farnesylation is involved in basal defence. To study the potential for increased susceptibility in Era1silenced wheat plants, two known wheat pathogenic bacterial strains (X. translucens B74 and B75) were tested for their increase or decrease in virulence against Era1-silenced wheat plants compared to non-silenced wheat plants under drought and well-watered conditions (Fig. 5B).

The VIGS technique offered the best approach for testing the function of these genes in wheat for several reasons. The most important reason is that VIGS does not require a transformation step, which is still technically challenging in wheat. The potential of homologous copies of a gene to compensate for the absence of a homologue that has been silenced can be overcome in VIGS. All endogenous mRNA with at least 80% similarity to the host-derived sequence contained in the viral vector are targets for degradation. While this is an advantage of VIGS, it is also a disadvantage in that the specific gene responsible for the effect is not known and would require further experiments.",

The stress protocol used in the present study involved initial exposure of silenced plants to an acclimation stress prior to exposure to severe stress. The viral inoculation was done at late evening on well-watered healthy plants and water stress was imposed gradually over 4 dpi by gradually withholding water. The initial adjustment time was important as the virus also imparts some level of stress on the plants. The protocol to characterize genes involved in the stress-recovery response involved inoculation of VIGS vector 4 days prior to water stress induction to coincide with higher transcript downregulation of targeted genes. The levels of silencing (from 2.6-to 22-fold) achieved for the targeted genes were comparable to other VIGS wheat studies (Scofield et al., 2005;Bruun-Rasmussen et al., 2007;Van Eck et al., 2010). The consistent phenotype across the silenced plants also neutralized the concern of the stress response to BSMV masking the effect of water stress effects, suggesting that drought trait functional studies can be carried out by VIGS in wheat.",

Down-regulation of Sal1 leads to constitutively increased ABA content in A. thaliana (Wilson et al., 2009). Sal1 acts as a negative regulator of predominantly ABA-independent as well as ABA-dependent stress response pathways, such that its inactivation results in altered osmoprotectants, higher leaf RWC, and maintenance of viable tissues during prolonged water stress (Wilson et al., 2009). This study also showed that reduced expression of Sal1 in wheat resulted in increased RWC, and increased WUE, as well as improved vigour, suggesting a similar function of Sal1 Fig. 5.

            "text": "Interestingly, the effect of silencing Cyp707a homologues in wheat was different from previous findings in Arabidopsis. Loss of function of Cyp707a was reported to enhance drought tolerance in A. thaliana (Umezawa et al., 2006). In contrast, Cyp707a-silenced wheat plants did not show any improvements in terms of dry weight, WUE, or RWC of silenced plants compared to water-stressed BSMV 0 -treated control plants under water stress. The differences in response between Arabidopsis and wheat plants to loss of function of Cyp707a may be due to differences in stress adaptation pathways between wheat and Arabidopsis. Another possible reason for the observed difference may have to do with the structure of the Cyp707a gene family in the two species. In A. thaliana, the Cyp707a gene family consists of Cyp707a1-Cyp707a4, all of which are upregulated in response to dehydration and subsequent rehydration, suggesting that the function of Cyp707a genes is redundant (Kushiro et al., 2004). Although there is only one Cyp707a cDNA sequence reported for wheat (accession EU430344.1), with three copies amplified by PCR in hexaploid wheat in this study, it is possible that other copies of Cyp707a exist in wheat. The DNA sequences of these other copies could potentially be different enough to cause ineffective silencing using the VIGS construct used in this study, leading to compensation of gene function by the remaining active genes. This emphasizes the importance of having the wheat genome sequence information in attempts to functionally test Arabidopsis gene homologues in wheat.",

            "text": "Out of the three genes tested in this study, Era1 appeared to be the most promising as a potential target for drought tolerance breeding in wheat. Mutations in Era1 could be readily identified through TILLING, taking advantage of resources that already exist in wheat (Slade and Knauf, 2005;Uauy et al., 2009). Because of the role of ABA in germination and dormancy, the present study tested Era1-silenced plants for germination rates. Indeed, Era1-silencing done at the booting stage resulted in a 6-10-day delay in germination compared to non-silenced plants. This trait may provide a solution for tackling pre-harvest sprouting in wheat. Pre-harvest sprouting is a consequence of ABA deficiency and leads to loss of grain weight and a reduction in end-use quality of wheat (Fang and Chu, 2008). While Era1 has also been suggested to play a role in basal defence against bacteria and oomycytes (Goritschnig et al., 2008), the Era1-silenced wheat plants showed similar phenotypes in response to bacterial infection as non-silenced wheat plants under both water stress and well-watered conditions. This implies that there is no fitness cost to Era1-silenced plants under favourable conditions. It would be interesting to further study the differences in the function of Era1 in pathogen susceptibility between wheat and Arabidopsis.",

This is the first report of VIGS being successfully used in wheat to functionally characterize genes thought to be involved in drought tolerance. The transient nature of VIGS did not deter from generating valuable observations for screening potential drought tolerant genes in wheat. One major strategy adopted by plants during drought tolerance is avoiding dehydration (Serraj and Atlin, 2009). Results from the present study indicate that downregulation of genes which reduce stomatal conductance may be a useful strategy for enhancing drought tolerance in wheat, if the same results hold in the field.",
