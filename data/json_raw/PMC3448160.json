            "text": "In sub-Saharan Africa, cryptococcal meningitis (CM) continues to be a predominant cause of AIDS-related mortality. Understanding virulence and improving clinical treatments remain important. To characterize the role of the fungal strain genotype in clinical disease, we analyzed 140 Cryptococcus isolates from 111 Ugandans with AIDS and CM. Isolates consisted of 107 nonredundant Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii strains and 8 C. neoformans var. grubii/neoformans hybrid strains. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to characterize genotypes, yielding 15 sequence types and 4 clonal clusters. The largest clonal cluster consisted of 74 isolates. The results of Burst and phylogenetic analysis suggested that the C. neoformans var. grubii strains could be separated into three nonredundant evolutionary groups (Burst group 1 to group 3). Patient mortality was differentially associated with the different evolutionary groups (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.04), with the highest mortality observed among Burst group 1, Burst group 2, and hybrid strains. Compared to Burst group 3 strains, Burst group 1 strains were associated with higher mortality (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.02), exhibited increased capsule shedding (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.02), and elicited a more pronounced Th 2 response during ex vivo cytokine release assays with strain-specific capsule stimulation (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.02). The results of these analyses suggest that cryptococcal strain variation can be an important determinant of human immune responses and mortality. IMPORTANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is a common life-threatening human fungal pathogen that is responsible for an estimated 1 million cases of meningitis in HIV-infected patients annually. Virulence factors that are important in human disease have been identified, yet the impacts of the fungal strain genotype on virulence and outcomes of human infection remain poorly understood. Using an analysis of strain variation based on in vitro assays and clinical data from Ugandans living with AIDS and cryptococcal infection, we report that strain genotype predicts the type of immune response and mortality risk. These studies suggest that knowledge of the strain genotype during human infections could be used to predict disease outcomes and lead to improved treatment approaches aimed at targeting the specific combination of pathogen virulence and host response.",

            "text": "Numerous relationships between pathogen genotypes and virulence have been demonstrated in bacterial and viral pathogens (15)(16)(17)(18) as well as between Cryptococcus gattii genotypes and virulence in the outbreak on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada (19,20), suggesting that cryptococcal strain variation could play a role in determining the clinical outcome. However, clinical outcomes in cryptococcosis are multifactorial-both the pathogen and the host contribute to disease. Epidemiological characteristics of Cryptococcus neoformans, virulence-associated phenotypic traits, and host immune responses have been studied as individual factors influencing the outcome of cryptococcosis, but none of these studies have found associations between cryptococcal strain variation and human disease (21,22). We propose that exogenous (pathogen) and endogenous (host) factors contribute concurrently to the pathophysiology of cryptococcosis. Consequently, an integrated investigation of the cryptococcal strain and the host immune response could provide valuable insight into cryptococcal pathogenesis and potentially lead to custom therapies that target the host-pathogen interface. Thus, we hypothesize that differences in strain genotype, as determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and strain phenotype could be responsible for disease severity and clinical outcome in patients. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed cryptococcal strains and clinical data from a cohort of ART-naive Ugandans with AIDS and CM. We report that the genotype of the infecting strain is associated with the type of immune response and clinical outcome.",

Only one strain showed a polymorphism at the URA5 locus. The SOD1 locus was completely clonal in our population. Locus allele identifiers for each strain were combined to produce a strain sequence type (ST) that serves as a representation of the strain genotype. A total of 15 sequence types were identified ( Table 2). The sequence types consisted of 4 clonal clus- ters and 11 singleton sequence types (Fig. 1A). The largest clonal cluster (UgCl001) contained 74 isolates. The other clonal clusters contained 14, 5, and 3 isolates (represented in Table 2 by UgCl021, UgCl011, and UgCl057, respectively). A single representative strain for each sequence type was used to analyze evolutionary relationships between the UgCl strains and further stratify the isolates into distinct groups. Phylogenetic analyses, including maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and bootstrap analyses, were performed on the concatenated sequences of MLST loci for the 15 identified sequence types. Maximum parsimony analysis was performed with inclusion of reference strain sequences for the major C. neoformans var. grubii VNI, VNII, and VNB clades to place the resulting tree in the context of previously established evolutionary relationships (Fig. 1B). Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses produced comparable results (not shown). To further stratify the isolates, an MLST-specific Burst clustering analysis was performed (26). The Burst clustering hypothesized a division of the 15 sequence types into three nonredundant Burst groups and four more distant singleton strains (Fig. 1C). The more highly stratified three Burst groups were used in subsequent clinical and phenotypic analyses. For the 4 patients with multiple infections, 2 patients had infections with strains in the same Burst group, and thus the demographic and clinical comparisons were not repeated. Two of the patients had infections with strains in different Burst groups. In these instances, the clinical and geographic data from the two patients were included in the analysis of both respective Burst groups.",

Because only 2 out of 132 C. neoformans var. grubii strains were mating type a, sufficient  variation was not present to allow for comparison of mating type to genotype, phenotype, or patient outcome. Melanin production by the clinical isolates was analyzed using media containing niger seeds or L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine). These media provide biphenolic precursors for melanin production along distinct pathways (27). A relative scoring method based on similarity to reference strains with weak (JEC20) and strong (KN99\u2423) melanization was employed to analyze melanin production over 48 h (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material). K-means clustering analysis for both types of media showed separation of the melanin production into 10 major clusters on niger seed medium and 7 major clusters on L-DOPA medium ( Fig. S3B). The Burst and hybrid groups did not differ significantly in their ability to produce melanin on niger seed medium (Fig. 3A). In contrast, while no association between genotype and melanin production on L-DOPA was observed for the Burst groups, the hybrid group had significantly higher melanin production on L-DOPA medium (P \u03ed 0.001 by the Tukeyadjusted t test) ( Fig. 3B).",

This result could be confounded by differences in the fungal burden in patients, resulting in inaccurate measures of capsule production. Consequently, an in vitro quantitative CRAG assay was performed to more precisely determine the capacity of each strain to produce and shed capsule. Burst group 1 strains had the highest capacity to produce and secrete capsule (Fig. 3C). The hybrids produced significantly less capsule than the rest of the Burst groups (P \u03ed 0.005 by Tukey-adjusted t tests). Importantly, Burst group 1 showed elevated capsule release compared to Burst group 3 (P \u03ed 0.02 by Tukeyadjusted t test) and higher (but not statistically significant) capsule release compared to Burst group 2 strains.

The UgCl strains had the same SOD1 locus observed in other African cohorts (24,29), but the Ugandan cohort had significant clonality, and the pre-  dominant clade has diverged from the VNI, VNII, and VNB reference alleles. These data suggest that cryptococcal populations in Uganda are isolated and highly clonal and that the unique Burst group 1 genotypes may be responsible for the unusually high mortality rates observed in Ugandan patient cohorts. The study by Miglia et al. found several sequence types associated with specific geographic regions in South Africa (28).

Previous studies identified coinfections based on the phenotypic traits (30), mating types (25), or genotypes of serial isolates (31). Desnos-Ollivier estimated that coinfections could account for 20% of cryptococcal disease based on studies of a French cohort (25). Similarly, 17% of the Ugandan patients screened for coinfection were infected with multiple genotypes. The effect of coinfection on clinical presentation and patient outcome remains to be determined. In this study, only 4 patients had confirmed coinfections, and only two of the patients had infections with evolutionarily distinct strains in different Burst groups. Unfortunately, because the vast majority of the clinical isolates used here were colony purified before storage, coinfection could not be controlled in this study, and the effect of coinfection on clinical outcome remains unknown. If coinfection rates are almost 20%, as the available data suggest, then coinfection could lead to a 20% error rate in accurately predicting the host response to infection. In this case, our results showing associations between genotype and clinical outcome could underestimate the differences between genotypes. The differences might be more pronounced if coinfections were identified and excluded from the analysis. Future studies in which coinfections and single infections are analyzed for their clinical outcome and host response will be necessary to define the effect coinfection has and whether the host response is cumulative, associated with the predominant strain, or associated with the most antigenic strain. However, the high prevalence of coinfection suggests that single colony-purified isolates may not accurately represent C. neoformans infections. This has broad implications for many types of studies, including studies assessing antifungal susceptibility.",

First, the high degree of variability in the in vivo CRAG titers and small cohort made the statistical comparisons underpowered. Second, many uncontrolled factors, including duration of infection and amount of fungal proliferation, affect the amount of capsule present in the in vivo samples. These factors likely resulted in the high variability of the in vivo CRAG titers. The number of cells and duration of culture were controlled more rigorously in the in vitro assay. Consequently, we were able to stratify the Burst groups and hybrids based on capsule shedding. Notably, the high-lethality Burst group 1/2 strains shed the greatest amount of capsule, whereas the less-lethal Burst group 3 strains shed significantly less capsule. The observation that capsule differences between genotypes are statistically associated with differences in patient mortality suggests that genetic diversity of the cryptococcal capsule may directly influence clinical outcome and immune response in humans.",

A larger cohort of patients infected with hybrid strains compared to C. neoformans var. grubii strains is needed to further explore differences between the infections. The hybrids exhibited high melanin production on L-DOPA medium but shed the least amount of capsule compared to the C. neoformans var. grubii isolates. The genetic divergence of the hybrids relative to the nonhybrids, combined with the low number of hybrids analyzed, prevents meaningful deduction in this regard.

Protective immunity to Cryptococcus requires several elements. Innate cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells produce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) (monocyte chemotactic peptide 1 [MCP-1]), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1 [MIP-1\u2423]), and IL-12 to recruit and license additional leukocytes to the site of infection (34)(35)(36). The innate immune system alone is not sufficient to clear cryptococcal infections, as assistance is required from adaptive immunity with helper T cells. The priming and differentiation of CD4 \u03e9 T cells to the Th 1 lineage is crucial for a protective immune response to cryptococcal infection (37). IFN-\u2425 produced by Th 1 cells not only acts in a positive-feedback loop to stimulate the production of more Th 1 cells but also classically activates macrophages to increase reactive oxygen production and kill internalized cryptococcal cells (38)(39)(40). Conversely, an IL-4-driven Th 2 adaptive response generates alternatively activated macrophages, is nonprotective, results in greater fungal burden, and allows dissemination (41). The Th 1 /Th 2 balance paradigm used to define interactions between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the human host may also apply to Cryptococcus (42,43). The pathogen competes against the host to shift a protective Th 1 response to a pathogenic Th 2 response. How Cryptococcus affects this balance is an active area of research, and capsule production is one potential strategy that could be used by Cryptococcus.",

High-lethality Burst group 1 isolates stimulated greater IL-4 and IL-10 production compared to lesslethal Burst group 3 isolates. IL-4 is a powerful inducer of Th 2 development, serving as a positive-feedback signal for more IL-4 production as well as a negative-feedback signal for Th 1 responses. Similarly, IL-10 is a suppressive cytokine that has antagonistic effects on Th 1 responses and development (13). These data suggest that the high-lethality Burst group 1 isolates shift the Th 1 /Th 2 balance in favor of the pathogenic Th 2 response.

Therefore, it is likely that T cell antigens, mainly proteins, present in the preparation were processed and presented by APCs to generate the Th 1 protective immune response observed in all of the preparations. In contrast, capsule polysaccharide is widely implicated in host immune evasion and can influence host responses in several ways. Capsule can directly inhibit opsonization, phagocytosis, and lysosomal degradation within phagosomes (44)(45)(46). In addition, shed capsule can disrupt cytokine signaling and lymphocytes (6,47,48). The major component of capsule polysaccharide, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), can also promote secretion of Th 2 cytokines by monocytes (49). Burst group 1 strains produce more polysaccharide than Burst group 3 strains, yet the amount of polysaccharide used in the ex vivo assay was held constant. Thus, the differences in immune response to the capsule preparations observed in the ex vivo assay were due solely to genetic differences between the Burst group 1 and 3 strains that affect the structure, function, and/or composition of the capsule polysaccharide or other components of the preparation. The fact that Burst group 1 strains also produce more capsule polysaccharide suggests that the actual effect on the Th 1 /Th 2 balance is even greater than observed in the ex vivo antigen stimulation assay. A shift in the Th 1 /Th 2 balance in favor of a pathogenic Th 2 response results in greater fungal burden, dissemination, and ultimately death in mouse models of cryptococcosis (50,51). Our data show strains capable of shifting the Th 1 /Th 2 balance toward a Th 2 cytokine response in humans are also associated with high mortality rates.",

Eight loci were amplified and sequenced-seven International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) consensus loci CAP59, GPD1, IGS1, LAC1, PLB1, SOD1, and URA5 (23) and the optional highly polymorphic TEF1 locus (24). An additional LAC1Ra primer was developed to replace the consensus primer, which was not sufficiently specific for LAC1 amplification in our samples. All primers are listed in Table S2 in the supplemental material. MLST PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, purified, and sequenced. Sequence assembly was performed with Sequencher 4.9 software (Genecodes, Ann Arbor, MI). Exported sequences were truncated to the consensus MLST ends (23). Sequences for each locus were aligned using ClustalW software (66). All polymorphisms were verified using the sequence chromatograms, and alignments were manually edited to resolve ambiguities. Multiple alignments were processed with PAUP4.0b10 software (Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA) to produce maximum parsimony trees using a heuristic algorithm with 1,000 random sequence additions and gaps treated as the fifth base. A total of 4,430 characters were analyzed: 4,315 characters were constant, 71 variable characters were parsimony uninformative, and 44 characters were parsimony informative. Sequences for all loci for each UgCl sample were concatenated and subjected to maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and bootstrap analyses using PAUP4.0b10 software. Nonredundant allelic sets were compiled using the Non-redundant databases (NRDB) web tool (http://pubmlst.org). Novel allele sequences were deposited in MLST.net (http://www.MLST .net), BioloMICS.net, and BLAST public databases. Sequence types were identified as combinations of allelic types for individual loci based on NRDB data. Sequence types were subjected to Burst analysis (26) to produce a putative evolutionary relationship between clusters of closely related sequence types. A minimum spanning tree was produced from the sequence types with Prim's algorithm combined with Burst clustering.",
