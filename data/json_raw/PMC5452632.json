The aim of this study was to modify the Greek version of Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (GR-SMAQ) for patients undergoing hemodialysis (GR-SMAQ-HD) and explore its validity and reliability. Between June 2016 and November 2016 a group of patients undergoing hemodialysis (N=107) completed the Greek version of SMAQ. The study was carried out in three Dialysis Units of Hospitals of Athens and Peloponnese region, Greece. The form of GR-SMAQ was modified specifically for renal patients while four additional items were added so as the tool study all aspects of adherence to hemodialysis regimen. Construct validity was checked through exploratory factor analysis with principal Component Analysis with the Equamax method. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency were tested. Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21. The significance level was set up at 5%. The Greek version of SMAQ for patients undergoing hemodialysis includes eight questions. Three factors emerged from factor analysis. Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient was 0.742 for the whole scale and for each subscale was for Medication Adherence 0.75, for Attendance at hemodialysis session 0.856 and for Diet/Fluid restriction was 0.717. The total mean score was 6.29 (\u00b11.82). GR-SMAQ-HD is a reliable and valuable tool that can be used by hemodialysis nurses and students of nursing for detection of adherence levels in clinical practice.",

            "text": "End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD) is one of the chronic diseases with effects on patient's quality of life. Patients undergoing hemodialysis must adhere to a very restricted diet and fluid intake. These patients require four hours of dialysis sessions three times a week at dialysis unit. These results in a loss of time that affects employment, leisure and social relationships (Ikonomou et al., 2015). Patients undergoing HD experience multiple problems such as sodium and water retention (Lee, 2012), hyperphosphatemia (Karamanidou, Clatworthy, Weinman, & Horne, 2008), hyperkalemia (Bellizzi et al., 2016), hypertension, anemia (Erlingmark, Hedstr\u00f6m, & Lindberg, 2016), fatigue (Zyga et al., 2015) heart disease (Segall, Nistor, & Covic, 2014) or diabetes mellitus (van der Meer, Ruggenenti, & Remuzzi, 2010). The management of such health issues involves several variations in the patient's lifestyle. The success of treatment depends largely on patient adherence to stringent recommended regimen. Non-adherence to therapeutic recommendations can have untoward effects on quality of life (Ibrahim, Hossam, & Belal 2015), increased morbidity, healthcare costs and mortality. Overall, it is estimated that approximately 50% of patients on dialysis are poorly compliant with their treatment (Kammerer, Garry, Hartigan, Carter, & Erlich, 2007).",

Nonadherence to fluid restriction can cause anxiety, panic, dyspnea, hypertension and pulmonary edema. Repeated excessive fluid intake periods burden on the cardiovascular system. Although hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the results of studies on the relationship between the nonadherence to fluid restriction and mortality were positive (Szczech et al., 2003) or negative (L\u00f2pez-G\u00f2mez, et al., 2005).

            "text": "Patient adherence is measured in various ways in clinical practice. The measurement methods used may be objective or subjective. Pills counting are usually carried out in patient's home or during his visit to the clinic but cannot determine the discharge, accumulation or movement of the pills to another container. The measurement of prescriptions or prescriptions renewed in right time provides us information for adherence but no information is given whether the patient actually takes the medication or not. The direct observation may seem the most precise method; however, patients can hide their drugs in their mouths and reject them when they are not visible. The method of direct observation is most useful in measuring adherence through the presence to the appointment with the therapist. The electronic devices are accurate and a degree of patient cooperation is required. Blood and urine tests are expensive and impractical for use in the routine. Therefore, health professionals should be based on less direct and less sensitive methods. Interviews and questionnaires are flexible and practical methods to obtain information on the adherence to the treatment. However, the questionnaires may be difficult to use for patients with low levels of literacy. The Hill-Bone Compliance Scale (Hill-Bone) consists of three subscales (medication taking behavior, attendance in appointments and sodium intake) but it has limited generalization as it aims only to patients taking antihypertensive agents. Due to its high reliability (Cronbach's a 0.84) in populations of the black race, its use is recommended for studies in these populations (Kim, Hill, Bone, & Levine 2000;Krousel-Wood et al., 2013). The Eight-Item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) focuses on medication behavior and particularly in reduced use and negligence of taking medication (Tan, Patel, & Chang 2014). The Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) focuses on beliefs and compliance barriers (Nguyen, Caze, & Cottrell, 2014). It is based on the scale Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) and explores the medication behavior and attitudes towards medication of patients with psychosis with high validity and reliability (Cronbach's a 0.75) (Thompson, Kulkarni, & Sergejew, 2000).",

            "text": "In order to measure HD patient adherence, self-report instruments such as reliable and validates questionnaires are often used. Literature review revealed a small number of scales which can be used especially for hemodialysis patients. The Renal Adherence Attitudes Questionnaire (RAAQ) is a scale consisted of 26 items measuring attitudes toward adherence while the Renal Adherence Behaviour Questionnaire (RABQ) is a scale consisted of 25 items evaluating self-reported dietary and fluid adherence (Rushe & McGee, 1998). The Dialysis Diet and Fluid Non-Adherence Questionnaire (DDFQ) (Vlaminck, Maes, Jacobs, Reyntjens, & Evers, 2001) is a 4-item scale that assesses the level of adherence to fluid and dietary restriction for the past 14 days. However, the above tools do not explore the levels of attendance in HD session and medication use (Vlaminck et al., 2001). The End Stage Renal Disease Adherence Questionnaire (ESRD-AQ) is a 46 item questionnaire that addresses all aspects of adherence in HD. Nevertheless, the large number of questions should be considered (Kim, Evangelista, Phillips, Pavlish, & Kopple, 2010). Finally, the Fluid Control in Hemodialysis Patients Scale (FCHPS) is a tool conducted on 2010 by Albayrak Cosar & Cinar Pakyuz to focus on knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes of HD patients about the aspect of fluid restriction (Albayrak Cosar & Cinar Pakyuz, 2010).",

The following changes were made by the group: item 4 was amended as follows: \"Have you ever forgotten to take your medications during the time interval between two dialysis sessions?\" as patients undergoing HD may visit dialysis clinics on Saturday or on Sunday, also. Item 1 was removed as the right time of taking medication is likely to coincide with HD sessions. Finally, item 6 was, also, not included because patients undergoing HD visit dialysis clinics day by day. Four additional items were introduced to achieve the modification of the GR-SMAQ for patients undergoing HD. The above modifications were made with the consensus of Theofilou P. by whom the GR-SMAQ was translated into Greek language (Theofilou, 2012) for patients with lung cancer. Score range from 0-8. Higher scores indicate greater adherence to HD regimen. It takes only 4 minutes to complete. The SMAQ was, firstly, constructed by Knobel et al. (2010) to measure adherence levels among HIV patients. It has, also, been used for evaluating adherence to phosphate binders among patients undergoing HD (Arenas, et al., 2010a;2010b) and patients with early breast cancer (Oberguggenberger et al., 2012) respectively.",

Most of them focus on measure of medication and behavioral barriers to adherence (Lam & Fresco, 2015). The Hill-Bone Compliance Scale has limited generalization as it aims only to patients taking antihypertensive agents (Kim et al., 2010). The Brief Medication Questionnaire can detect different types of non-adherence to the treatment (recurring or sporadic) (Svarstad, Chewning, Sleath, & Claesson, 1999). The Medication Adherence Questionnaire is, also, known as the 4-Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) and Morisky Scale is the most widely used scale. It has been used in a wide range of diseases and patients with low educational level (Culig & Leppee, 2014). The Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) focuses on beliefs of adherence (Thompson, Kulkarni, & Sergejew, 2000).",
