Links between millisecond-level precision of auditory processing and the consistency of sensorimotor beat synchronization implicate fine auditory neural timing as a mechanism for forming stable internal representations of, and behavioral reactions to, sound. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a systematic relationship between consistency of beat synchronization and trial-bytrial stability of subcortical speech processing in preschoolers (ages 3 and 4 years old). We conclude that beat synchronization might provide a useful window into millisecond-level neural precision for encoding sound in early childhood, when speech processing is especially important for language acquisition and development."

Dinstein et al., 2015). This neural stability comes into play when an individual interacts with sound; unstable processing in the auditory system has been observed in individuals with language impairments (Ahissar et al., 2000;Evans et al., 2009;Hornickel et al., 2009;Hornickel and Kraus, 2013). Stable neural processing of structured temporal patterns may be particularly crucial for language acquisition and development: anticipation and detection of the timing of auditory events allows a listener to tune in to and predict important acoustic features (Large and Jones, 1999;McAuley et al., 2006) necessary for distinguishing and reproducing syllabic segments, prosodic cues, and the rapidly changing acoustic features that differentiate meaningful segments of speech (Baruch and Drake, 1997;Bertoncini and Mehler, 1981;Eimas et al., 1971;Ramus, 2000;Saffran et al., 1996;Tallal, 1980). Thus, stable neural coding of speech timing during early childhood -a period of intense, rapid learning and an age critical for mapping meaning to auditory input (Kuhl et al., 1992;Ruben, 1997) -could be acutely important for language learning.",

The FFR reflects both temporal and spectral physiognomies of auditory stimuli with fine resolution (Skoe and Kraus, 2010).

Synchronizing to an external beat likely relies on temporal fidelity for auditory perceptual coding, motor production, and coupling between auditory and motor systems (Sowi\u0144ski and Dalla Bella, 2013). The auditory midbrain appears to be particularly important for beat synchronization, as it is uniquely positioned to play an integrating role: inferior colliculus receives ascending connections from subcortical auditory structures and motor areas (e.g., basal ganglia; Coleman and Clerici, 1987;Kudo and Niimi, 1980) and descending input from cortex (Bajo et al., 2010), in addition to sending information to cerebellum (another area crucial for fine motor control) via dorsolateral pontine nuclei (Hashikawa, 1983;Mower et al., 1979;Saint Marie, 1996).",

We predicted more consistent auditory-motor timing, as revealed through beat synchronization, would relate to higher levels of intertrial neural stability for processing speech syllables. Furthermore, our previous work identifying links between beat synchronization and neural envelope tracking precision led us to hypothesize that stability of low-frequency encoding in particular would relate to beat synchronization, because the envelope measure is filtered to capture low-frequency modulations. Our findings suggest that stability of auditory neural encoding may be an important foundation for sensorimotor integration in preschoolers. Furthermore, beat synchronization may serve as a useful behavioral tool for assessing developmental auditory neural function in young children.",

The experimenter sat across from the child with two conga drums between them, one for the experimenter and one for the participant. Each conga had a Pulse Percussion DR-1 drum trigger attached to the underside of its drumhead to record the drum hits and convert vibrations into voltage in real time with no delay. The experimenter covertly listened and drummed to an isochronous beat presented through an in-ear headphone and encouraged the child to imitate and drum along with the experimenter. Auditory stimuli and drum hits of both the experimenter and participant were recorded as two separate two-channel recordings in Audacity version 2.0.5. Four trials were performed: two trials at 2.5 Hz followed by two trials at 1.67 Hz. Each trial was 20 s in duration, resulting in 50 isochronous drum hits for the 2.5 Hz trials and 33 drum hits for the 1.67 Hz trials. The use of two rates allowed for the assessment of general synchronization ability as opposed to synchronization to a specific rate, reducing the potential bias of an individual's preferred tempo."

Due to the high intersubject variability in intensity and rapidity of drumming, drum hits for the experimenter and participant were detected by setting an amplitude threshold and a refractory period on a participant-by-participant basis. The first point at which the signal exceeded the amplitude threshold was marked as a hit, immediately followed by a refractory period during which the program did not mark peaks (to ensure multiple points were not marked for each hit). Accuracy of automated hit detection was checked manually to ensure onsets were correctly marked for each hit."

            "text": "Beat synchronization ability was assessed using circular statistics (Fisher, 1993), a useful tool for assessing sensorimotor synchronization when there is not one-to-one correspondence of hits and pacing stimuli (Kirschner and Tomasello, 2009;Sowi\u0144ski and Dalla Bella, 2013;Fujii and Schlaug, 2013), as is the case with this dataset: children frequently missed hits or did not synchronize continuously over a session. Each drum hit was assigned a relative phase angle (\u03b8 or \"accuracy\") in degrees by subtracting the hit time from the nearest experimenter's hit, dividing the result by the ISI, and multiplying by 360. The mean of all vectors resulted in R, a measurement of the extent to which participants tended to maintain a constant temporal relationship between their drum hits and the experimenter's. We define beat synchronization \"consistency\" as the average vector length across each of the two trials and across both rates. These two measures seem largely independent (correlation between consistency and accuracy: r (25) = \u22120.275, p = 0.183). Recent work has shown the ability to synchronize to an external beat is still developing during this age (Kirschner and Tomasello, 2009;Woodruff Carr et al., 2014). Therefore, Rayleigh's test was applied to the set of all vectors produced in the two trials for a given rate to determine whether a participant was successfully synchronizing (the null hypothesis of this test is that the distribution of data points occur randomly in time near or away from the pacing stimuli onsets, indicative of chance performance; p > 0.05). The two trials at each rate were combined to compute a Rayleigh's p-value for each rate. If a child's Rayleigh's test resulted in a p <0.05 at both rates, the child was included in analyses. Our previous work (Woodruff Carr et al., 2014) investigated group differences in neural processing between children who could (p < 0.05) and could not (p > 0.05) synchronize; the current investigation expands upon this work by investigating neural correlates of synchronization ability within an expanded group of successful synchronizers.",

Intertrial stability of the ABR was assessed using a procedure previously reported (Hornickel and Kraus, 2013;Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b).To calculate the stability of a participant's response to the speech stimuli, 2000 of 4000 trials were randomly selected and averaged. The remaining 2000 trials were also averaged. The two sub-averaged waveforms were then correlated over the 0 to 170 ms range to determine their similarity. These steps were repeated 300 different times, each with different random samplings of trials, and the 300 correlation values were averaged to generate a final measure of intertrial neural response stability. Neural stability for encoding the click stimulus was assessed over 0 to 11.95 ms of the response using the same methodology: the two subaveraged waveforms (1000 randomly selected, averaged trials) were correlated to determine similarity 100 times, each with different random samplings of trials, and the correlation values were averaged. To specifically examine the timing variability in frequency encoding of the 170 ms speech-evoked FFR, intertrial phase-locking (Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b) was calculated in 20 Hz windows surrounding the fundamental frequency of the stimulus (100 Hz) and its harmonics up to 1000 Hz. Time-frequency spectrum was calculated using a short-time fast Fourier transform that resulted in a matrix containing two measures for each time \u00d7 frequency point: a vector length (the extent to which each frequency is encoded in the FFR) and phase (the timing of that frequency). To specifically analyze the timing variability, each vector was transformed into a unit vector. For each frequency, the 4000 vectors were averaged and the length of the resulting vector was calculated as a measure of the consistency of phase across trials. Low frequency phase-locking was captured by averaging across the vectors for 100, 200, 300, and 400 Hz, while high frequency phase-locking was computed as a mean of the vectors for harmonics 500-1000 Hz. Intertrial neural stability and phase-locking correlation values were Fisher and log transformed to conform to the expectations of a linear model (normality and sphericity).

The overall model accounts for 48.7% (F (5,19) = 3.605, p = 0.018) of variance in consistency of beat synchronization. (See Table 1B for full regression results.) Assuming an alpha level of p< 0.05, a post hoc power analysis revealed a large effect size (Cohen's f 2 =0.522) and sufficient power (0.887). This effect was specific to lower frequencies (100-400 Hz): incorporating high frequency (500-1000 Hz) phase-locking into the regression model in a third step did not improve its fit (\u0394R 2 < 0.001, p = 0.943).",

Less variability when encoding sound may allow for more regularly-timed motor reactions. We propose trial-by-trial neural stability supports the developmental process of coordinating auditory-motor beat synchronization in young children. The present findings are in line with previous studies linking the ability to tap consistently to a beat and stability of subcortical sound processing (Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b), and provide a unique developmental perspective for a neural timing metric that underlies literacy skills (Hornickel and Kraus, 2013;Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b). This mechanism appears to be in place at an early age, during the development of many important language skills, and prior to explicit reading instruction.",

The subcortical nervous system works to detect sub-second differences in intervals (basal ganglia) and integrate this performance feedback across modalities (through connections from the dorsal cochlear nucleus to the cerebellum) to make subtle timing adjustments (Merchant et al., 2008), resulting in error-correction of asynchronies that does not always necessitate conscious effort (Ito, 2008;Repp, 2000;Schwartze and Kotz, 2013). Although the influence of motor variability during beat synchronization cannot be ruled out, we believe this is not a main factor influencing our results. Other work with children this age reports no correlation between motor variability in spontaneous tapping and synchronization tasks (Drake et al., 2000), suggesting that variability in synchronization performance in young children is primarily driven by factors other than motor variability. We suggest our neural stability measure captures auditorymotor integration, and future work is needed to parse the influence of these separate, but connected, systems.",

This connection between millisecond-level timing in the auditory midbrain and coordination of motor movements to synchronize at much slower rates may be a function of hierarchical temporal scaffolding, with incredibly fast neural fidelity (i.e., intertrial stability of the FFR for dynamic formant transitions and periodic vowels) acting as temporal subdivisions to support sensorimotor synchrony (i.e., beat synchronization consistency) at slower rates. This finding is coherent with previous work demonstrating concomitance between beat synchronization and low-frequency temporal encoding precision: correlations were observed between beat synchronization consistency and subcortical envelope tracking, but not for broadband stimulus encoding (Woodruff Carr et al., 2014). Together, we suggest the ability to tune in to and exploit slow modulations of spectral information emerges first developmentally, supporting more stable trial-by-trial neural encoding.",

Increased neural variability would make the process of learning the correct probabilities and statistics of acoustic events challenging, and individuals with poor neural stability could exhibit difficulties in predicting their environment. In the case of autism, individuals with greater neural noise also exhibit heightened sensitivity to details at the consequence of an impaired ability to integrate details into gestalt percepts (Dinstein et al., 2015). Neural instability might be responsible for some of the deficits exhibited by children with language difficulties who struggle to process timing information in speech, through the process of stochastic resonance (McDonnell and Abbott, 2009). Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon where a signal normally too weak to be detected is boosted by noise. This may bias children with autism to focus on details rather than attempt to integrate them, and could also explain a pattern observed in the auditory domain for children with dyslexia. These children with auditory-based learning disorders exhibit an allophonic mode of speech perception, demonstrating higher sensitivity to irrelevant phonemic distinctions (Serniclaes et al., 2004). Supporting this idea, greater variability in auditory-neurophysiological responses elicited by speech have been reported in poor readers (Hornickel and Kraus, 2013; and animal models of dyslexia (Centanni et al., 2013).",

            "text": "In summary, we provide biological evidence of relationships between auditory-motor beat synchronization and intertrial neural stability for encoding speech sounds, establishing these links for the first time in emergent readers. We suggest that stable neural responses to sound may be integral to the emergence of sensorimotor synchronization skills. These findings illuminate a potential underlying neural mechanism that links the ability to synchronize and development of phonological processing during preschool years, as observed in previous work (Woodruff Carr et al., 2014). Encouragingly, neural synchrony can be improved through auditory training (Hornickel et al., 2012;Russo et al., 2005;Song et al., 2012). In addition, musical training has been shown to improve beat synchronization (Slater et al., 2013). Given relationships observed in the present work, it seems possible that a rhythmbased music training program might prove successful for refining temporal processing and consequential language and literacy skills (Bhide et al., 2013;Kuhl, 2007). Future work exploring the potential therapeutic benefits of an auditory-motor integration task, such as drumming in time to music or speech, could inform preemptive treatment for children with substandard auditory processing before behavioral struggles manifest. The ability to consistently time motor movements to an auditory beat relates to (a) intertrial neural stability (r (25) = 0.554, p = 0.004) and (b) low-frequency (100-400 Hz) intertrial phase-locking (r (25) = 0.609, p = 0.001) of neural responses to sound. To further illustrate the robust relationship between intertrial neural phase-locking and beat synchronization, participants were dichotomized as relatively (a) poor (N= 13) or (b) good (N= 12) synchronizers based on a median split according to their beat synchronization consistency. The good beat synchronization group's phase-locking power to the stimulus [da] is more robust for the fundamental frequency (100 Hz) and its harmonics (at 200,300, and 400 Hz; F (1,23) = 12.967, p = 0.002).",
