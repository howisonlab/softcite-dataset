The results of this study showed that variables such as height, BMI of fat, and percentage of central fat varied in different classification stages of somatic maturation. As observed, the rates of height were higher in stages during and after PHV. The BMI of fat and the percentage of central fat had higher rates of somatic maturation in pre-PHV stage.
