The results of this study showed that variables such as height, BMI of fat, and percentage of central fat varied in different classification stages of somatic maturation. As observed, the rates of height were higher in stages during and after PHV. The BMI of fat and the percentage of central fat had higher rates of somatic maturation in pre-PHV stage.

Several factors may influence the development of obesity in adolescence, namely, inadequate dietary intake, physical inactivity, sexual maturity, socioeconomic status and parental influence (29) . According to Duarte (20) , the interrelationships between growth, physical development, and maturation are still poorly known in Brazilian children and adolescents.",

The study indicates the importance of following these anthropometric and body composition variables from the beginning of pubertal growth spurt in females, in order to control the accumulation of adipose tissue, as well as its future consequences on the health of adolescents. Therefore, we realize the importance of working with somatic maturation in assessing body composition of adolescents."

Future studies with adolescents in the initial period of adolescence (10 to 14 years) may show the relationship between body composition, and stages of somatic and sexual maturation in both sexes. Therefore, health professionals may use somatic maturation as an additional tool to evaluate a healthier body development of adolescents."
