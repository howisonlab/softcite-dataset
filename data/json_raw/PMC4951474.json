This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) for treating morbidly obese Korean adults. Materials and Methods: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we reviewed the medical records of 261 obese patients who underwent different bariatric procedures. Clinical outcomes were measured in terms of weight loss and resolution of comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Safety profiles for the procedures were also evaluated. Results: In terms of weight loss, the three procedures showed similar results at 18 months (weight loss in 52.1% for SG, 61.0% for LAGB, and 69.2% for RYGB). Remission of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was more frequent in patients who underwent RYGB (65.9%, 63.6%, and 100% of patients, respectively). Safety profiles were similar among groups. Early complications occurred in 26 patients (9.9%) and late complications in 32 (12.3%). In the LAGB group, five bands (6.9%) were removed. Among all patients, one death (1/261=0.38%) occurred in the RYGB group due to aspiration pneumonia. Conclusion: The three bariatric procedures were comparable in regards to weight-loss outcomes; nevertheless, RYGB showed a higher rate of comorbidity resolution. Bariatric surgery is effective and relatively safe; however, due to complications, some bands had to be removed in the LAGB group and a relatively high rate of reoperations was observed in the RYGB group.",

            "text": "Obesity is a serious health problem for Western countries and a growing health concern for most countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In Korea, the prevalence of obesity in adults, defined as a body mass index (BMI) \u226525 kg/m 2 , has gradually increased from 29.2% in 2001 to 31.4% in 2011. 1 Bariatric surgery is considered the most efficacious treatment for severe obesity in the long term. Bariatric surgery results in long-term weight-loss control, along with lifestyle improvements and amelioration of risk factors, within a decade after surgery. 2 Furthermore, bariatric surgery is widely known to offer metabolic effects in patients with type II diabetes. One study demonstrated that diabetes remission, defined by blood glucose <110 mg/dL without diabetes medications, was 72.3% at 2 years and 30.4% at 15 years after bariatric surgery. 3 Worldwide, metabolic/bariatric surgeries have more than doubled from 2003 to 2011: the most frequently performed bariatric in 2011 was the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), followed by sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). 4 Many bariatric surgeons prefer RYGB over SG or LAGB, because the former procedure is associated with better outcomes of weight loss and resolution of comorbidities. However, RYGB is also associated with higher rates of readmission and reoperation/intervention; 5 hence, other surgeons prefer SG or LAGB over RYGB, because these procedures have a better safety profile.",

            "text": "Bariatric surgery was first performed in Korea in January 2003, when the first laparoscopic SG was performed, 9 followed later in the same year by laparoscopic RYGB, mini-gastric bypass, and vertical banded gastroplasty. In 2004, the first LAGB procedure was performed. By 2009, LAGB was the most popular bariatric procedure in Korea (68%), followed by RYGB (16%), SG (5.5%), and mini-gastric bypass (3%). 6 This is an interesting phenomenon, since LAGB is decreasing in popularity worldwide in favor of other procedures. 4 One possible reason is the less invasive nature of the LAGB procedure and the reluctance of Korean patients to undergo \"major\" surgery. Many papers have compared surgical outcomes between different bariatric procedures; however, the conclusions were not categorical and sometimes conflicted. Chapman, et al. 10 compared LAGB with vertical banded gastroplasty and RYGB, concluding that LAGB was superior to the other procedures in terms of safety and weight-loss outcome, at least after 4 years of follow-up. However, a cohort study that compared RYGB with LAGB in matched patients and followed them for 3 years showed superior weight loss and comorbidity reduction in the RYGB group. 11 In a multicenter study that compared RYGB with SG, RYGB was associated with greater morbidity; however, weight loss was comparable at 6, 12, and 18 months, and remission of  type 2 diabetes was more frequent. 12 Given the increasing popularity of SG over LAGB as a restrictive procedure, one interesting study by Chakravarty, et al. 13 compared LAGB with RYGB, vertical banded gastroplasty, and SG. In this systematic review of randomized controlled trials, the authors concluded that LAGB was not the most effective bariatric procedure to reduce weight, compared with the other procedures; nevertheless, it was associated with fewer early complications, as well as a shorter operative time and shorter length of hospital stay.",

The percentage of EWL was similar for the three procedures. In terms of AWL, RYGB demonstrated better outcomes only at 6, 9, and 15 postoperative months. As this study was not prospective, this marginal difference in weight loss may have been due to the heterogeneous population group and inter-institutional differences in patient management protocols. Moreover, the follow-up period of only 18 months was quite short. We may speculate that the weight-loss outcome might have been more pronounced in favor of RYGB and SG over a longer follow-up period. Indeed, a systematic review of randomized trials comparing SG, RYGB, and LAGB has shown a trend toward a better weight-loss outcome with RYGB (62.1-94.4%), compared to SG (49-81%) and LAGB (28.7-48%), over a followup period of up to 3 years. 14 We demonstrated an effective resolution of comorbidities after bariatric procedures. RYGB, in particular, showed significantly better outcomes than LAGB and SG in regards resolution of diabetes and dyslipidemia. These results are consistent with those from other studies that analyzed the resolution of comorbidities after different operations. 15 However, since the prevalence of comorbidities was different among groups, it would be difficult to make a direct comparison and determine which procedure was superior in this respect.",

First, the patient population was not homogenous, as those who underwent RYGB had more comorbidities. Second, the surgeons participating in this study had varying levels of bariatric surgical experience. Third, this was not a prospective study, but a retrospective cohort study with a limited follow-up period.
