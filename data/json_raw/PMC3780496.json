Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of chain pharmacists in the Tucson area. The Warr-Cook-Wall questionnaire of job satisfaction was used to evaluate community pharmacists' satisfaction with their current position. This study used Rasch analysis to assess the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The Rasch scores obtained for each respondent were used as a dependent variable in univariate and bivariate analyses to evaluate differences in job satisfaction. Results: A total of 32 pharmacists responded from 129 chain community pharmacies in the cities of Tucson, Marana and Oro Valley, Arizona. The mean (SD) Rasch score for job satisfaction was 0.93 (2.1). Results from bivariate analysis indicate that pharmacists in the Tucson area with practice experience outside community pharmacy were less satisfied with their job compared to those without experience outside community pharmacy (p<0.01). Conclusions: This pilot evaluation suggests that having pharmacy experience outside community practice affects pharmacist job satisfaction. Additionally, findings from this study indicate that there is reliability and validity evidence to support the use of the modified Warr-Cook-Wall questionnaire for assessing overall job satisfaction in chain community pharmacy practice.",

Thus, dissatisfaction may also affect the way that patients view the pharmacist and patients may then be inclined limit their interactions with the pharmacist. 3 It is important to realize that a decrease in pharmacist performance could cause patient harm or even death. 4",

            "text": "There are limited preliminary studies exploring aspects that impact community pharmacists job satisfaction and most of current evidence has been conducted in hospital settings. National surveys of community pharmacists show that perceived workload, and information technologies may have an effect on job satisfaction. 3,9,10 In addition, continuing pharmacy education and preceptorship have been identified to be significant predictors of career and job satisfaction among community pharmacists. 2,11 Other factors that have been shown to affect job satisfaction are treatment by management 10,12 and other interpersonal interactions including patient contact and coworkers relationships 8,13 , compensation 7,14 , pharmacy ownership 4 , and practice setting. [14][15][16] Community and chain pharmacists were found to be less satisfied with their jobs than pharmacists in other settings. 15 The effect of demographic characteristics such age, sex, and education level on community pharmacist job satisfaction is still contradictory in the published literature. 7,10,15,16 Most of the studies examining the factors affecting job satisfaction for community pharmacists have used instruments developed, validated and used in hospital settings 17 , which may not capture factors within the realm of community pharmacy. Additionally, previous studies have measured satisfaction with single-item or a limited number of Likert type rating scales within larger studies that assess general aspects of pharmacy worklife 4,8,18 and thus they may not capture the different traits of the job satisfaction multidimensional construct. Finally, some studies have adapted instruments from other settings to measure community pharmacy facets not assessed with available standardized tools. 14,[19][20][21] However these studies used narrow population samples, thus more evidenced is needed to support validity of such instruments in community pharmacy.",

Each of the chain community pharmacies were faxed a questionnaire and cover letter a total of three times with approximately one month between distribution waves. Each store was sent one copy of the questionnaire and a cover letter explaining the study during each wave. The cover letter explained study goals, intent of the investigators, information about anonymity and included instructions on how to return the questionnaire (i.e. fax number). The cover letter also included a web address where the survey was available online. The cover letter encouraged all pharmacists working at each pharmacy to complete the survey. The store was responsible for making enough copies so that each pharmacist could complete his or her own survey. Responses were faxed back to a phone number that put the response directly into an email account. Received data were introduced into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.

The Rasch person reliability index denotes the reproducibility of person placement across other items measuring the same construct, which is equivalent to the Cronbach's alpha (test reliability) in classical test theory. 22,23,26 An overall score of job satisfaction among community pharmacists in Tucson was calculated converting the ordinal responses from the Warr-Cook-Wall questionnaire to interval data (logits) with the Rasch Model if the Rasch model's requirements mentioned above were met. A higher score in logits represents greater job satisfaction (logits typically ranges from -4 to 4). The Rasch overall score was used as a continuous variable in descriptive, and non-parametric bivariate analyses to explore differences in job satisfaction and age, type of degree (PharmD/Non-PharmD), years of experience, workload (Avg. prescription volume/week, and whether they worked more than 36 hours/week), type of pharmacy chain (Grocery/non-grocery), having experience outside of community practice (yes/no), provision of patient care services at the pharmacy (yes/no) and job position (Pharmacist in charge yes/no) the selection of these variables was based on previous studies. 15 Statistical significance was set at 0.05.

Figure 1 show that the instrument demonstrated appropriate functioning of the rating scale categories used. The number of observations in each category was greater than 10 and the average category measures increased with the rating scale categories. Pharmacists responding with a \"1-Not Satisfied at all\" showed an average measure (-1.64) lower than those responding with a \"2-Satisfied\" (average measure= -0.36), etc. There was no evidence of misfit categories (Outfit MNSQ <2), and the probability curve in Figure 1 depicts that all category values were more likely to be used at some point of the continuum thus no inversions were found. Figure 2 shows the order of the items relative to the optimized rating categories and measures and what would be expected to be more or less challenging. From this Figure, it appears that there were gaps in the measurement continuum (between items 5 and 7, and items 1 and 9), which were not statistically significant (p=0.2).

            "text": "This paper reports the results of a pilot study that assessed the job satisfaction of Tucson area retail chain setting. Findings from this study indicate that responding pharmacists in the Tucson area with practice experience outside community pharmacy were less satisfied with their job. These findings are consistent with those of previously published research. 3,15,29 Several reasons can be thought to explain these results. First, there could be a perception of over-qualification for the job that may not be present while working in hospital settings. This is reflected in the responses to the item \"opportunities to use abilities\" where only one quarter of respondents indicated, \"very satisfied\" to this item. Second, pharmacist in community settings may be have limited opportunities to growth within the organization.",

This may be explained by misunderstanding of the items.",

            "text": "On the other hand, \"Patient contact\" was the easiest item to endorse. This could occur because community pharmacists in chain settings have more patient contact, which favors interpersonal interactions. Research has found that pharmacist value these interpersonal interactions and determine their intention to stay on a job. 8 Due to an unintentional inversion of the response scale during questionnaire development, we expected to find an inversion of the probability curve in the Rash model. However, the analysis showed that respondents did not detect the inversion of the questionnaire scale. That is, respondents selected the option \"satisfied\" as it was \"somewhat satisfied.\" This could be explained by a potential familiarity with 4-point Likert-scale surveys that may facilitate the identification of the anchors in the scale without carefully reading options in between. Additionally, research shows that people tend to respond on the left side of a scale and response order bias is affected by readers' habits. 31,32 An area for future research may include broadening the variable \"experience outside community practice\" to determine to what pharmacists are comparing to, when assessing their level of satisfaction. Aspects to consider include the extent to which the use of clinical skills in other settings affects job satisfaction and years and related activities of experience working outside community practice.",

Conversely, researchers have found that pharmacists that are more satisfied with their work are highly motivated to do a good job and make patients and employees encounters with the pharmacist more positive. 2 For this reason, pharmacy job satisfaction surveys are an important part of identifying the weaknesses of a specific job so that those weaknesses can be corrected or minimized, while maximizing the strengths, which leads to a better and safer experience for everyone involved.",

Another limitation is that some pharmacists might not have been in the pharmacy on the day of questionnaire dissemination, which means it is possible that not all of the pharmacists received a questionnaire or to know if a pharmacist actually filled the questionnaire. Even if a pharmacist received a questionnaire he or she may not have completed it, or the pharmacy manager may not have distributed the questionnaires to all of the pharmacists working at the store.",
