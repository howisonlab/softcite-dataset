Recently, it was suggested that the C-peptide-to-glucose ratio after oral glucose ingestion is a better predictor of b-cell mass than that during fasting. We investigated whether postprandial C-peptide-to-glucose ratio (PCGR) reflects b-cell function, and its clinical application for management of type 2 diabetes. Materials and Methods: We carried out a two-step retrospective study of 919 Korean participants with type 2 diabetes. In the first step, we evaluated the correlation of PCGR level with various markers for b-cell function in newly diagnosed and drug-na\u20ac \u0131ve patients after a mixed meal test. In the second step, participants with well-controlled diabetes (glycated hemoglobin <7%) were divided into four groups according to treatment modality (group I: insulin, group II: sulfonylurea and/or dipeptityl peptidase IV inhibitor, group III: metformin and/or thiazolidinedione and group IV: diet and exercise group). Results: In the first step, PCGR was significantly correlated with various insulin secretory indices. Furthermore, PCGR showed better correlation with glycemic indices than homeostatic model assessment of b-cell function (HOMA-b). In the second step, the PCGR value significantly increased according to the following order: group I, II, III, and IV after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and duration of diabetes. The cutoff values of PCGR for separating each group were 1.457, 2.870 and 3.790, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusions: We suggest that PCGR might be a useful marker for b-cell function and an ancillary parameter in the choice of antidiabetic medication in type 2 diabetes.",

            "text": "Although many leading organizations emphasize individualized glycemic targets and treatment to lower glucose according to specific patient characteristics, the current algorithms of antihyperglycemic therapy in type 2 diabetes are based on treatment modality only considering the fasting and random blood glucose concentration, which are represented by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), in individual patients [1][2][3] . It remains controversial to select first-line drugs to treat diabetic patients, even though metformin is a preferred first-line drug. In addition, there is no consensus to approach the most effective treatment for an individual patient. Because most patients have already experienced substantial loss of b-cell function at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes 4,5 , it is more reasonable to select initial antidiabetic medications or modify drugs with consideration for b-cell function of individual patients.",

Although insulin resistance shows little variation among patients with type 2 diabetes, pancreatic b-cell function declines progressively over time. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the Belfast Diet Study have shown that progressive loss of b-cell function is a major cause of hyperglycemia and is also related to treatment failure of diabetes 7,8 . In this regard, not only the evaluation of secular changes in insulin secretion, but also accurate methods to evaluate b-cell function are important for management of diabetes 9 . C-peptide, which is cleaved from insulin in secretory granules, is a well-known marker for b-cell function 10,11 . In contrast to other indices for insulin secretion, C-peptide evaluation is able to assess b-cell function even in patients undergoing insulin therapy. Recently, it was suggested that the C-peptide-to-glucose ratio after oral glucose ingestion might be a better marker for pancreatic b-cell mass than fasting measures, such as the homeostatic model assessment of b-cell function (HOMA-b) 11 .",

Our investigation was a retrospective twostep study. In the first step, we investigated whether PCGR showed a significant correlation with indices for insulin secretion function, such as HOMA-b, as well as with indices for glycemic control. We analyzed 361 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients who were drug-na\u20ac \u0131ve, and had undergone a mixed meal test between June 2009 and April 2011. These participants included most of the patients described in our previous study 12 . The test was a standardized liquid meal test (Ensure; Meiji Dairies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan; 500 kcal, 17.5 g fat [31.5%], 68.5 g carbohydrate [54.5%] and 17.5 g protein [14.0%]) after overnight fasting. Blood samples were collected at 0 and 90 min (basal and stimulated levels, respectively) for glucose, insulin and C-peptide analyses. We used fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, glycated albumin (GA) and HbA1c as the glycemic indices. For the insulin secretory indices, we used fasting or postprandial C-peptide (FCP or PCP), delta C-peptide (DCP), fasting C-peptide-to-glucose ratio (FCGR) or PCGR, insulinogenic index (IGI), index for C-peptide (ICI) and HOMA-b.",

We first evaluated whether PCGR levels were significantly different among the groups. Subsequently, we investigated the cut-off values of PCGR for discriminating each medication group. To evaluate the validity of the cut-off values of PCGR, a training set comprising of randomly selected cases (70% of the participants) was used to select an optimal cut-off, which was then tested on the independent left-out validation set (30% of the participants). The blood samples for plasma glucose and C-peptide were obtained after an overnight fasting and 2 h after an individually composed breakfast.

From the training set (70% of the participants), the PCGR cut-off value for discriminating between group I (insulin) and group II (SU/DPPIVi) was 1.457 (AUC 0.763, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.86) with 92.6% sensitivity and 60.0% specificity; between group II (SU/ DPPIVi) and group III (Met/TZD) was 2.870 (AUC 0.634, 95% CI 0.58-0.69) with 75.5% sensitivity and 51.4% specificity; between group III (Met/TZD) and group IV (D&E) was 3.790 (AUC 0.593, 95% CI 0.53-0.66) with 69.5% sensitivity and 49.1% specificity (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 1). In the validation set (the remaining 30% of the participants), the sensitivity and specificity of PCGR cut-off value were 81.0% and 41.7% between group I (insulin) and group II (SU/DPPIVi), 73.9% and 44.4% between group II (SU/DPPIVi) and group III (Met/TZD), and 70.5% and 52.2% between group III (Met/ TZD) and group IV (D&E), respectively.  19,20 . However, the interpretation of insulin concentrations is complicated, because insulin levels should be not only matched with glucose concentrations, but also borne in mind in the situation of insulin use. Although HOMA is often used in large clinical and epidemiological studies, it is not suitable for some diabetic patients because of hyperglycemic state or  insulin use. In addition, a recent study measuring b-cell area in humans showed that there was no relationship between HOMA-b and b-cell area 11 .",

A study showed that the reduction of postprandial insulin secretion is more prominent than that of fasting insulin secretion in the progression of type 2 diabetes 22 . It was thus suggested that postprandial b-cell function might be a more important factor for glycemic control than fasting b-cell function. Although there are many studies on indices for insulin secretory function, only a few studies have investigated staged management of type 2 diabetes based on insulin secretory function using these indices. Furthermore, the studies were only able to distinguish which patients require insulin therapy based on the indices 23,24 . Recently, PCGR after oral glucose ingestion was suggested to be a better predictor for the b-cell area, the region responsible for bcell function, than fasting measures 11 . Therefore, we used a new, expanded practical index, PCGR, for assessing insulin secretion as part of a new therapeutic strategy for individualized treatment for type 2 diabetes. To precisely analyze the relationship between endogenous insulin secretion and the various markers, we carried out a standardized mixed meal test in newly diagnosed, drug-na\u20ac \u0131ve type 2 diabetic patients. PCGR values were correlated with other insulin secretory indices, such as HOMA-b, IGI and ICI (Table 2). Additionally, PCGR showed a strong correlation with glycemic indices including plasma glucose level and glycated index for glycemic control (HbA1c and GA) than HOMAb (Figure 1). These results suggest that PCGR might be used as an index for insulin secretion in practical fields. In addition, PCGR is easily calculated using postprandial C-peptide and glucose levels measured at the time of diagnosis for type 2 diabetic patients.",

As shown in Figure 2, PCGR levels after adjusting for age, sex, BMI and duration of disease were different according to the medication group (2.27 -0.28, 3.32 -0.11, 3.89 -0.13, 4.53 -0.14 for group I (insulin), group II (SU/ DPPIVi), group III (Met/TZD) and group IV (D&E), respectively, P < 0.001 for ANCOVA). We also obtained the cut-off values of PCGR to distinguish each treatment group in patients with well-controlled glycemic level from the training set and verified that in the validation set. From the analysis of the training set, the cut-off values of PCGR for discriminating between treatment groups were 1.457, 2.870 and 3.790, respectively (all P < 0.001; Figure 3). In the validation set, the sensitivity of the PCGR cut-off value was maintained as relatively constant, although the specificity of that was low. We suggest that these cut-off values could be applied when choosing antidiabetic agents for patients with type 2 diabetes. In accordance with the present results, recent studies have shown that PCGR is also a better predictor of future insulin therapy than fasting C-peptide index 25,26 . PCGR is a simple and practical marker for insulin secretion, and it can be helpful in determining appropriate treatment modalities, such as insulin, insulin secretagogues (SU and/or DPPIVi), insulin sensitizer (Met and/or TZD) and lifestyle modification. As plasma glucose is the most potent stimulator of insulin secretion, it is presumed that PCGR level reflects b-cell function more precisely than FCGR or plasma Cpeptide level itself does. Furthermore, insulin secretion is more impaired in the postprandial state than in the fasting state 7 , and it is stimulated by high plasma glucose level and incretin hormone 27 . Thus, PCGR index might be a more useful predictor of b-cell function than other indices measured during the fasting state.",

Based on the results from the present study, a prospective study is in progress. Second, we did not examine glucagon-stimulated C-peptide levels, which is one of the most widely used methods for insulin secretory functions of diabetic patients 28,29 . In addition, the C-peptide levels could have been influenced or modified by the medications in the second step analysis. For instance, prolonged treatment with sulfonylurea could have reduced C-peptide, whereas prolonged treatment with TZD could have increased b-cell mass. For this reason, a prospective study of drug-na\u20ac \u0131ve patients is in progress, based on PCGR value. Third, we did not include meglitinide in the present study, although we suggest the use of similar cut-off values of PCGR as in group II (SU/DPPIVi), especially for patients with high postprandial glucose. Fourth, we could not separately assess the additional effects of insulin sensitizer (Met or TZD) in group I (insulin) or group II (SU/DPPIVi), although 76.4% of patients in the present study had already been treated with additional insulin sensitizers, such as Met or TZD. Finally, the different cut-off values of PCGR should be investigated in different ethnic populations. Despite these limitations, we were able to differentiate treatment modalities of well-controlled type 2 diabetic patients with PCGR, and this value can be a useful marker in the determination of antidiabetic therapy.",
