            "text": "MammaPrint is an FDA-cleared microarraybased test that uses expression levels of the 70 Mam-maPrint genes to assess distant recurrence risk in earlystage breast cancer. The prospective RASTER study proved that MammaPrint Low Risk patients can safely forgo chemotherapy, which is further subject of the prospective randomized MINDACT trial. While Mam-maPrint diagnostic results are obtained from mini-arrays, clinical trials may be performed on whole-genome arrays. Here we demonstrate the equivalence and reproducibility of the MammaPrint test. MammaPrint indices were collected for breast cancer samples: (i) on both customized certified array types (n = 1,897 sample pairs), (ii) with matched fresh and FFPE tissues (n = 552 sample pairs), iii) for control samples replicated over a period of 10 years (n = 11,333), and iv) repeated measurements (n = 280). The array type indicated a near perfect Pearson correlation of 0.99 (95 % CI: 0.989-0.991). Paired fresh and FFPE samples showed an excellent Pearson correlation of 0.93 (95 % CI 0.92-0.94), in spite of the variability introduced by intratumoral tissue heterogeneity. Control samples showed high consistency over 10 year's time (overall reproducibility of 97.4 %). Precision and repeatability are overall 98.2 and 98.3 %, respectively. Results confirm that the combination of the near perfect correlation between array types, excellent equivalence between tissue types, and a very high stability, precision, and repeatability demonstrate that results from clinical trials (such as MINDACT and I-SPY 2) are equivalent to current Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (",

            "text": "The use of multigene diagnostic testing to guide cancer treatment has increased dramatically, since the clinical introduction of the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared multigene diagnostic signature Mam-maPrint [1]. These types of genomic tests interrogate gene expression levels in tissues to give information about the disease state and/or prognosis, and have led to new diagnostic approaches that are recognized by international clinical guidelines [2,3]. MammaPrint determines the expression of 70 signature genes and helps guide physicians to make adjuvant treatment decisions for early-stage breast cancer patients [4,5]. The test is suitable for both fresh or fresh frozen (fresh) tissues and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues [4,6,7]. MammaPrint is part of Agendia's In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Test Suite that also includes BluePrint, which reveals breast cancer subtype [8].",

However, for diagnostic purposes, shipment of frozen tissue is not always easily implemented in community hospitals. Therefore, RNAretain (for room temperature sample stabilization during shipment) was validated, FDA-cleared and implemented [11,12] and subsequently, MammaPrint was validated and cleared for use of FFPE tissues [6,13]. To date, MammaPrint is one of the two (MammaPrint and Prosigna [14]) FDA-cleared [15] clinically implemented breast cancer multigene expression tests with 6 clearances, and obtained the EU IVD CE mark, for both fresh and FFPE tissues [1,11,13,[16][17][18].

The activity of the 70 signature genes is compiled in an index that is used to establish the qualitative MammaPrint results: Low Risk or High Risk for distant recurrence. Designated clinically low risk patients with positive hormonal receptor status could well be treated by hormonal therapy in the adjuvant setting [3], while clinically high risk patients are more suited to receive a combination of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy in an (neo-) adjuvant setting [3]. Clinical studies have shown MammaPrint's clinical prognostic value in lymph-node negative [10,22] and lymph-node positive [19] breast cancer, for women diagnosed at all ages [21], and irrespective of pathological grade [9], estrogen receptor status or HER2 expression [20]. The RASTER study [12] provided the first prospective evidence of clinical utility for MammaPrint. It showed a 98.9 % 5-year metastasis-free survival for patients that were clinically high risk, based on standard clinical parameters, but who chose not to receive adjuvant chemotherapy based on their MammaPrint Low Risk status [5]. These study results indicated that these patients could safely forgo chemotherapy [23]. Confirmation of Mam-maPrint's prognostic value is expected in 2016, when results are projected for the large European Organization for Treatment and Cancer (EORTC) prospective randomized clinical MINDACT trial (EORTC 10041; BIG 3-04) [24][25][26].",

Both array types contain multiple replicates of the 70 signature probes complemented with an identical large set of replicated normalization and control probes. Diagnostic MammaPrint results are generally obtained using customized mini-arrays (also referred to as 8-pack arrays), accommodating 8 individual samples per array [4]. In large clinical trials like MINDACT [26] and I-SPY 2 [27], MammaPrint expression analysis was performed on wholegenome arrays containing over 32,000 unique probes per array. This array type is currently used in the I-SPY 2 trial with a MammaPrint FDA Investigational Device Exempt (IDE) status. For MammaPrint diagnostic use in Europe, both the customized mini-array and the customized wholegenome array hold an IVD EU directive CE mark. The use of whole-genome arrays allows providing MammaPrint results to clinical trial participants alongside enabling fullgenome analysis for the early development of new gene expression signatures. For the MINDACT trial, this resulted in an unprecedented dataset representing almost 6700 early-stage breast cancer patients.",

To demonstrate the equivalence of FDA-cleared, EU IVD-certified MammaPrint between customized miniarray and customized whole-genome array types, we assessed the agreement between MammaPrint index values of breast cancer tissues hybridized to both array types ( Fig. 1). Equivalence was measured using a set of 1897 samples with matching mini-and whole-genome arrays, spanning the MammaPrint index range generally seen in diagnostics. MammaPrint indices generated using the customized whole-genome array showed an almost perfect correlation with the matching indices for the diagnostic arrays (r = 0.99, 95 % CI 0.989-0.991). Figure 1 shows the scatterplot of the indices showing a tight clustering around the 45\u00b0line of perfect correlation. This was confirmed by the Passing and Bablok regression analysis (y = 0.002 ? 1.00x) and a Bland and Altman analysis showing no bias in the association of MammaPrint indices between mini-array and whole-genome array types (Online Resource 1).",

Equivalence was assessed on tumor samples for which both the FFPE and fresh tumor samples were analyzed. The data are naturally influenced by intrinsic tissue heterogeneity, over 5 % difference in MammaPrint results can be attributed to heterogeneity within the tumor [6,31]. Each dot represents a single female breast cancer sample for which RNA derived from fresh and FFPE tissues was hybridized twice to either a customized mini or customized whole-genome microarray (n = 552 hybridization pairs) or the specimen type is fresh or FFPE.  Other IVD multigene assays are currently available for early breast cancer patients, including the Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay (ProSigna, Seattle, WA, USA [14]), OncotypeDx Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA, USA [33]), Breast Cancer Index (BioTheranostics, San Diego, CA, USA [34]), and EndoPredict test (Sividon Diagnostics GmbH, Koln, Germany [35]). These assays are dedicated to FFPE breast cancer tissues and based on either microarray or (RT)-(q)PCR technology. IVD tests, like MammaPrint, need to be accurate, reliable, and clinically meaningful. Regulation under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) is the first crucial step for quality control related to laboratories and personnel. To ensure full patient safety and quality control of IVD tests, including the group of laboratory developed test (LDTs), adhering to FDA regulation is essential [36]. For diagnostic tests performed in the EU the equivalent regulatory oversight is the EU IVD CE mark and laboratory ISO-certification, requirements for which MammaPrint obtained regulatory certification as well. MammaPrint was the first of only two (MammaPrint and Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay) of the above described multigene signatures to obtain IVD CE mark and FDA clearance, for which it was required to demonstrate both analytical validity and clinical validity [36]. Moreover, MammaPrint is the first multigene classifier to publicly demonstrate such robust stability over time. Of note is that MammaPrint is independent of clinical factors, whereas the Prosigna gene signature assay is a combination of gene expression assessment (PAM50) and clinical factors (tumor size and proliferation score). MammaPrint diagnostic testing, including array types, is performed per FDA IVD 510 K clearance, or FDA Investigational Device Exempt status (IDE) for tests in the US, and EU IVD CE mark, whichever is required based on the quality regulatory oversight in respective countries.",

To broaden utility, we translated Mam-maPrint to FFPE, thereby enabling the use of FFPE tissues and facilitating the decision of applying a MammaPrint test even after surgery of the primary tumor. A comparison between fresh and FFPE tissues of the same sample is naturally influenced by intrinsic intratumoral heterogeneity and differences in tissue preservation techniques [30] that are together fully accounting for the observed deviations. A difference of 5 % in MammaPrint binary result can be attributed to these phenomena [6,31]. Despite this influence, comparison between fresh and FFPE demonstrated very high agreement (r = 0.93) in both MammaPrint Index values [6] and visualized clinical outcome prognosis, affirming previously described results [13]. Taken together, study results of large clinical studies featuring the 70-gene profile MammaPrint, in particular, the MINDACT trial whose level 1a evidence results will be available in 2016, can be interpreted and transposed to the current diagnostic setting based on FFPE tissues without any reservations.",

Additionally, Mam-maPrint for fresh and FFPE tissues are robust, equivalent, and stable tests (also at the clinical level) in spite of influences by tissue heterogeneity and tissue preservation techniques. Finally, stability assessment confirmed a very high reproducibility, precision, and repeatability of the MammaPrint test over time. This combination of high equivalence between different array types, between tissue types, and high stability over time demonstrates that results from clinical trials like MINDACT and I-SPY 2 are similar to the current MammaPrint FFPE and fresh diagnostics and can be used interchangeably.",
