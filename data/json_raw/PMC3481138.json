In a previous study, we showed that miR-26a was induced upon VitD3-mediated monocytic differentiation. Here, we identify E2F7 as a novel target of miR-26a. We show that E2F7 significantly promotes cell cycle progression and inhibits monocytic differentiation of AML cells. We also demonstrate that E2F7 binds the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 CIP1/WAF1 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A) promoter repressing its expression. Moreover, interfering with E2F7 expression results in inhibition of c-Myc (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) transcriptional activity. This leads to the downregulation of c-Myc transcriptional target miR-17-92 cluster, whose expression has a well-defined role in contributing to block monocytic differentiation and sustain AML cell proliferation. Finally, we show that the expression of E2F7 is upregulated in primary blasts from AML patients. Thus, these findings indicate that the newly identified miR-26a target E2F7 might have an important role in monocytic differentiation and leukemogenesis.",

            "text": "Cells derived from different AML French-American-British (FAB) subtypes, from M2 to M5, can be induced to differentiate, by specific agents, into cells that resemble normal counterparts. 1,[3][4][5] In particular, the vitamin D 3 metabolite 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (VitD3) can arrest proliferation of leukemic cells with a concomitant differentiation into more mature monocyte/macrophage cellular phenotype; thus, it is considered a good model for normal monocytic differentiation studies. One of the mechanisms responsible for the effect of VitD3 on monocyte/macrophage differentiation is the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 CIP1/WAF1 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A). [6][7][8] This multifunctional protein contributes to the cell cycle arrest and protection against apoptosis observed in mature monocytes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that have been shown to be involved in a variety of biological processes, including differentiation and oncogenesis, via the posttranscriptional regulation of protein coding genes. Several studies indicated that miRNAs are critical regulators of molecular networks involved in hematopoietic differentiation. 9 Moreover, deregulation of miRNA expression characterizes different subtypes of AML and may contribute to leukemogenesis by altering normal hematopoietic differentiation. 9 Taken together with protein factors, miRNAs have important roles in VitD3-induced cell cycle arrest and monocytic differentiation of AML cells. 10,11 Myc proteins are found to have a relevant role in controlling blood cell homeostasis. 12 They are transcription factors with essential roles in cell growth and proliferation through their ability to both positively and negatively regulate the expression of coding and noncoding genes. 13,14 C-Myc (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) is frequently activated in AML and has an important role in the induction of leukemogenesis. 12 Notably, c-Myc transcriptionally represses p21 CIP1/WAF1 expression, thereby sustaining AML cell proliferation. Conversely, p21 CIP1/WAF1 represses Myc transcriptional activity by interfering with its dimerization with Max protein. 15 Repression of tumor-suppressing miRNAs is a fundamental component of the Myc tumorigenic program. One of the relevant miRNAs repressed by c-Myc in hematopoietic malignancies is miR-26a, 16,17 which was shown to act as a tumor suppressor in different types of cancer. [18][19][20][21][22] In a previous study, we showed that miR-26a was induced upon VitD3-mediated monocytic differentiation of AML cell lines. 17 In addition, we have shown that miR-26a was downregulated in primary AML blasts and, if reconstituted in AML cell lines, was able to decrease proliferation and induce myeloid differentiation. 17 However, the mechanism underlying this effect was not fully understood. Here, we identify the transcriptional repressor E2F7 as a novel target for miR-26a function in AML. We show that E2F7 promotes cell cycle progression and inhibits monocytic differentiation of AML cells. The repression of E2F7 by miR-26a contributes to the increased expression of p21 CIP1/WAF1 observed during VitD3induced monocytic differentiation of AML cells. In addition, interfering with E2F7 expression results in inhibition of c-Myc activity and downregulation of the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster. Finally, we further show that, conversely to miR-26a, the expression of E2F7 is upregulated in AML blasts. Therefore, we identified a new regulatory network that might have a relevant role in leukemogenesis.",

            "text": "E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a and is upregulated in AML. We previously showed that miR-26a negatively regulates cell proliferation and stimulates myeloid differentiation of AML cells. 17 Notably, miR-26a negatively regulates G 1 /S transition in different tumors and this has been attributed, at least in part, to the direct regulation of EZH2 by miR-26a. 16,17,19,21 However, we showed that EZH2 is not a direct target of miR-26a in AML cells. 17 Thus, we decided to investigate novel relevant targets for miR-26a function in AML. Between the putative targets of miR-26a, we noticed the E2F7 transcription factor (data from TargetScan (www.targetscan.org) and Pictar (pictar.mdc-berlin.de)), an important regulator of the G 1 /S-phase transition. 23 The 3'-untranslated region (3 0 -UTR) of E2F7 contained two highly conserved putative binding sites for miR-26a ( Figure 1a). To show the direct targeting of E2F7 by miR-26a, we constructed luciferase reporters containing the wild type (WT) 3 0 -UTR of E2F7 (WT), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site I (Mut1), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site II (Mut2) or the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at both miR-26a binding sites (Mut1-2). Luciferase reporters were individually co-transfected in HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing miR-26a or control ( Figure 1b). The expression of WT reporter was significantly decreased by miR-26a compared with control. Reporter Mut1 behaved similarly to WT, while deletion of Mut2 partially relieved translational repression. On the other hand, expression of the reporter construct mutated at both miR-26a binding sites of E2F7 3 0 -UTR (Mut1-2) was not sensitive to miR-26a translational repression. This may be explained by the fact that the binding of miR-26a on site II increases the accessibility to site I or, alternatively, binding of one repressive complex on site II may serve as scaffold for attracting cofactors necessary for repression on site I. These results demonstrated that miR-26a regulated E2F7 expression through direct binding of the 3 0 -UTR.",

            "text": "We also examined the expression levels of E2F7 protein and miR-26a during monocytic differentiation of U937 induced by VitD3 (Figure 2b). As expected, E2F7 protein levels decreased upon monocytic differentiation and are inversely correlated to miR-26a levels (Figure 2b). Similar results were obtained during monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells ( Supplementary Figure 1). We previously showed that miR-26a is downregulated in primary AML samples. 15 Thus, we analyzed E2F7 expression levels in human monocytes isolated from healthy donors and diagnostic samples of AML patients by real-time RT-PCR ( Figure 2c). We have restricted the analysis to M2, M4 and M5 FAB subtypes because they can respond to monocytic differentiation in vitro. 3,4 High expression levels of E2F7 were detected in all AML samples compared with mature monocytes. These data indicated that E2F7 is upregulated in primary AML samples and that its expression is inversely correlated with miR-26a. Decreased E2F7 levels stimulate monocytic differentiation and inhibit proliferation of AML cells. It has been previously demonstrated that miR-26a induced the expression of p21 CIP1/WAF1 (Figure 2a) and, concomitantly, monocytic differentiation of AML cell lines. 17 Thus, we next investigated the role of E2F7 in monocytic cell differentiation. We selected U937 cells for further experiments because they have been extensively used as suitable model systems to study monocytic differentiation. These cells differentiate into mature monocytes by treatment with VitD3, a process mainly mediated by p21 CIP1/WAF1 expression and subsequent G 0 /G 1 cell cycle arrest. 6,7 Cells were infected with lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against E2F7 (L-shE2F7) or scramble shRNA (L-shSCR) and differentiation was evaluated by analyzing the morphology, immunophenotype and induction of specific molecular markers. Cells infected with Lenti-shE2F7 exhibited almost a complete depletion of E2F7 protein level (Figure 3a). Strikingly, the depletion of E2F7 induced drastic changes in the morphology of transduced cells. A nuclear condensation and more abundant cytoplasm were observed, indicating an induction of myeloid differentiation (Figure 3b). Notably, cells interfering with E2F7 presented a more pronounced differentiation upon VitD3 treatment with a feature of matured monocytes/ macrophages, such us indented nuclei, increased cytoplasmic processes and granules. Immunophenotype was analyzed to further examine differentiation. A strong increase in cells expressing the surface markers, cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) and cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b), which are upregulated during myelomonocytic differentiation, was observed upon depletion of E2F7 and treatment with VitD3 (Figures 3c and d). We also measured mRNA expression levels for marker of monocytic differentiation such as M-CSF, M-CSFr and MafB ( Figure 3e). We detected a strong increase in monocytic markers upon inhibition of E2F7 expression by RNAi, even in the absence of any inducer, indicating that the depletion of E2F7 is sufficient to commit U937 toward monocytic differentiation. Similar results were obtained with  Figure 2). Altogether, these results indicate that decreased E2F7 levels stimulated monocytic/macrophage differentiation of AML cells.",

We next evaluated whether enforced expression of E2F7 affected the differentiation status and proliferation of AML cells.

Doxycycline (Dox) treatment of U937 cells transformed with EBP-PURO-E2F7 increased the levels of E2F7 as compared with those transformed with the empty vector EBP-PURO ( Figure 5a). Moreover, E2F7 overexpression is retained after VitD3 treatment, when endogenous E2F7 protein levels decreased ( Figure 5a). High levels of E2F7 resulted in a reduction of VitD3-induced monocytic differentiation assessed by morphological changes and percentage of CD11-and CD14-positive cells compared to cells transfected with the empty vector (Figures 5c-e). Moreover, enforced E2F7 expression resulted in increased proliferation rate and percentage of cells in the S phase, while decreased the number of cells arrested in the G1 phase ( Figures 5b, f and g). Notably, this effect is maintained even after VitD3 treatment (Figures 5f and g).

A preliminary study showed that miR-26a was downregulated in AML by the oncogene c-Myc and that reconstitution of miR-26a in AML cell lines induced proliferation arrest and stimulated monocytic differentiation. 17 This study identified as a novel target for miR-26a function in AML the transcriptional repressor E2F7. E2F7 belongs to the atypical E2F members, which were initially identified as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression. 27 However, different studies revealed that atypical E2Fs might also act as a positive regulator of cellular proliferation. [28][29][30][31] Here, for the first time, we showed that E2F7 expression was upregulated in AML primary blasts. Recently, E2F7 was found upregulated in rhabdomyosarcoma, indicating that E2F7 misregulation might have significant role in tumorigenesis. 32 Herein, we demonstrated that E2F7 silencing in AML cell lines inhibited the cellular growth and induced monocytic differentiation. Conversely, enforced E2F7 expression stimulated proliferation and counteracted monocytic differentiation. The E2F7 knockdown in AML cells delayed cell cycle progression and in particular G1/S transition, which was not consistent with previous data obtained in fibroblast. 33 Notably, similar results have been described for the other atypical E2F factor E2F8 in hepatocellular carcinoma. 28,34 This suggests that E2F7, like E2F8, could act as a positive or negative regulator of cell cycle progression in a cellular contextdependent manner. Therefore, much more work will be necessary to identify E2F7 interacting proteins and assign specific functions to E2F7 in different cell lineages. Importantly, both miR-26a overexpression and E2F7 inhibition produces p21 CIP1/WAF1 accumulation, a factor that has a crucial role in the proliferation arrest and monocytic differentiation of AML cells. 6,8 We showed that the transcriptional repressor E2F7 is able to bind to p21 CIP1/WAF1 promoter region in proliferating AML cells; thus, sustaining the differentiation block of AML cells by inhibiting p21 CIP1/WAF1 expression. In summary, we propose a model in which the translational repression of E2F7 by miR-26a could contribute to a detachment of E2F7 from p21 CIP1/WAF1 promoter and, in turn, to the induction of p21 CIP1/WAF1 expression during VitD3mediated differentiation of AML cell lines. It is worth noting that just as E2F7 is just one of the hundreds of potential targets of miR-26a, p21 CIP1/WAF1 is just one of the downstream effectors of E2F7. Further studies will be needed to understand the relevance of this model in normal monocytopoiesis and AML.",

Indeed, E2F7 inhibition is sufficient to produce a decrease of miR-17-92. This suggests a model in which E2F7 could control miR-17-92 expression through the inhibition of c-Myc activity by p21 CIP1/WAF1 . However, further experiments will be needed to clarify the relation between p21 CIP1/WAF1 , c-Myc and miR-17-92 expression. Notably, the p21 CIP1/WAF1 mRNA is also a target of the miR-17 family. 26,35,36 Consequently, the decreased expression of miR-17-92 might contribute to enforce p21 CIP1/WAF1 expression during AML cell differentiation.

            "text": "In conclusion, this study identified a novel aspect of VitD3 action in regulating proliferation and differentiation of AML cells through the miR-26a/E2F7/p21 CIP1/WAF1 network. However, it should be considered that the level of complexity of gene regulation during these processes is such that no single circuitry operates in isolation and they are very likely part of fully integrated networks within the cells. Therein, the biological effect of a specific miRNA strongly depends on the cellular context. In particular, miR-26a has been shown to induce proliferation arrest in different tumor model systems, such as lymphomas and liver, breast and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. 16,17,21,22,37 Conversely, it has been shown to act as an oncogene in glioblastoma. 38 An important aspect to consider in using miR-26a as an antitumor molecule in AML is that p21 CIP1/WAF1 not only has a relevant role in the proliferation arrest during differentiation of normal and pathological hematopoietic progenitors [6][7][8] but also prevents excess DNA-damage accumulation and exhaustion of cancer stem cells. 39 Thus, consideration should be given to the design of antitumor therapies based on miR-26a.",
