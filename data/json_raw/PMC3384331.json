            "text": "Archaeal viruses have been the subject of recent interest due to the diversity discovered in their virion architectures. Recently, a new group of haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses has been discovered. It is distinctive in terms of the virion morphology and different genome types (ssDNA/dsDNA) harboured by rather closely related representatives. To date there are seven isolated viruses belonging to this group. Most of these share a cluster of five conserved genes, two of which encode major structural proteins. Putative proviruses and proviral remnants containing homologues of the conserved gene cluster were also identified suggesting a long-standing relationship of these viruses with their hosts. Comparative genomic analysis revealed three different ways of the genome organization, which possibly reflect different replication strategies employed by these viruses. The dsDNA genomes of two of these viruses were shown to contain single-strand interruptions. Further studies on one of the genomes suggested that the interruptions are located along the genome in a sequence-specific manner and exhibit polarity in distribution."

Despite the small number, it is apparent that they exhibit a variety of morphologies (1,2). Among only 34 crenarchaeal viruses described such unique virion morphologies as bottle-and droplet-shaped, ovoid or bacilliform can be encountered (1,2). Although most of the $50 euryarchaeal viruses described resemble bacteriophages (3,4), new types of viruses have also been discovered (3,5,6). This diversity of archaeal viruses is encompassed in ten families and a few unclassified groups (1).",

Studies on fuselloviruses, lipothrixviruses, tailed archaeal viruses and proviruses showed that, similarly to bacteriophages, these viruses have mosaic genomes composed of variable and conserved regions, parts of which are derived from a shared pool of genes (4,(8)(9)(10)(11)(12). The gene pool of archaeal viruses largely comprises open reading frames (ORFs) having significant similarity only to ORFs of other archaeal viruses or cells, and ORFans (13,14), genes that lack homologues in other genomes (15). Lately, many structural and functional studies have been undertaken in attempts to characterize proteins encoded by archaeal viruses (16)(17)(18). As a result, novel protein folds and viral proteins self-assembling into structures with rare symmetry were discovered (17,18).",

Here we focus on a group of haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses, which includes two earlier described members Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 (HRPV-1) and Haloarcula hispanica pleomorphic virus 1 (HHPV-1) (6,19,20) and four new members Halorubrum sp. pleomorphic viruses 2, 3 and 6 (HRPV-2, HRPV3 and HRPV-6) (3,21) and Halogeometricum sp. pleomorphic virus 1 (HGPV-1) (3). These pleomorphic viruses have a narrow host range and, except for HHPV-1, all infect a host that originates from the same sample as the virus (3). Analyses of the pleomorphic virions showed that the HRPV-1 and HHPV-1 viral particles consist of a genome enveloped in a lipid membrane with two major structural proteins (6,20,22). The smaller major structural protein, VP3, is predicted to contain several transmembrane (TM) helices, and in HRPV-1 it was shown to be membrane-associated (22). The larger major structural protein, VP4, is N-terminally processed, exposed to the viral surface and anchored to the membrane with a C-terminal TM domain (6,20,22,23). Thus, the VP4 proteins are predicted to be involved in receptor binding and fusion of the host and viral membranes (6,20,22,23). In HRPV-1, a third structural protein, VP8, which is a putative P-loop NTPase, has been identified (6). Both HRPV-1 and HHPV-1 contain a predicted ORF encoding a putative rolling circle replication initiation protein (RCR Rep) (6,20,24).",

The genomes of HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 are shown to be circular dsDNA molecules with localized single-strand interruptions. We present evidence for the discontinuous nature of HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 genomes and describe the interruptions in the HRPV-3 genome in more detail. Comparative genomic analysis of the expanded set of haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses and related putative proviral regions confirms the presence of the conserved cluster of identified and putative genes also found in the linear dsDNA genome of His2, a previously described haloarchaeal virus (5). In parallel study (21), His2, which is currently classified as a spindle-shaped virus (5), is suggested to belong to the group of haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses on the basis of the virion architecture. The comparative genomic analysis reported in this work supports this proposal and further shows that these pleomorphic viruses can be divided into three subgroups according to their gene content and genome organization.",

The obtained assembly was verified with PCR products that for HRPV-2, HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 covered the whole genome. The final genome sequences were obtained by sequencing these PCR products. For HRPV-6, several Sanger sequencing runs confirmed the initial assembly. The primers used for PCR and sequencing are listed in Supplementary Table S2. For the verification of the discontinuous regions, genomic DNA was used in sequencing reactions with primers, which are also listed in Supplementary Table S2. All sequencing reactions were carried out by using BigDye Termination Chemistry v. 3.1 and analysed on an ABI 3130 (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were purified with CleanSeq (Agencourt) using a Beckman NX p robot (Beckman Coulter). Sequences were assembled and edited using GAP4. The sequences were submitted to GenBank and can be found under the accession numbers JN882264 (HRPV-2), JN882265 (HRPV-3), JN882266 (HRPV-6) and JN882267 (HGPV-1).",

The properties of identified proteins and the products of putative ORFs were analysed using expert protein analysis system (EXPASY) proteomics tools. Isoelectric points and molecular masses were determined using Compute pI/MW tool (29). The signal sequences for VP4-like proteins were predicted using Signal P (version 3.0) (30) and TatFind Servers (31). Conserved protein signature sequences were determined using InterProScan (32). Putative trans-membrane regions of proteins were additionally determined using combined predictions by TMHMM tool (33) and TMPred tool (34). Coiled-coil regions were predicted using Coil tool (35). Multiple sequence alignments were generated using T-Coffee (36), Muscle (37) and Praline (38). Conserved DNA motifs in aligned nucleotide sequences (T-Coffee) were visualized with WebLogo (39).",

The results summarized in Table 2 show that the pleomorphic viruses contain either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA genomes. The dsDNA genomes of HRPV-3 and HGPV-1, however, were digested into distinct fragments by MBN, indicating possible single-stranded regions in the genomes (see below). All genomes are circular molecules varying in length between 8000 and 11 000 nt ( Table 2). The circularity of the HRPV-1 and HHPV-1 genomes was demonstrated earlier (6,20). HRPV-2 and HRPV-6 genomes were shown to be circular by exonuclease I digestion (data not shown). Isoforms of HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 genomes were visualized in 2D agarose gel (44) (Supplementary Materials and Methods, Supplementary Figure S1). Analysis revealed the existence of two major isoforms, one of which was attributed to relaxed circular, whereas the other one to linear form. Based on the results, we suggest that HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 genomes are also circular. The GC percentages of the viral genome sequences are shown in Table 2. Putative double-strand origins of replication (dso) are reported in the Supplementary results and the Supplementary Table S3. Analyses of the promoter and Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences are described in the Supplementary results. At the nucleotide level, the genomes show similarity reaching up to 74% along relatively short stretches ($400 nt). HRPV-2 and HRPV-6 genomes are an exception, as they seem to share high identity (up to 97%) over DNA regions up to 4000 nt ( Figure 1).",

The genomes of HRPV-2 and HRPV-6 conform to the gene order previously reported for HRPV-1 and HHPV-1. In these genomes, the first predicted open reading frame (ORF1) encodes a putative RCR Rep (24) and is located one or two ORFs upstream of the conserved cluster. HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 form the other subgroup of haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses. The most notable difference of HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 genomes compared to the first subgroup is that they do not contain the homologue of the replication initiation protein. These genomes are clearly divided into two regions that are transcribed in opposite directions. In addition to the conserved cluster, these two viruses share two ORFs, not found in the genomes of the first subgroup of viruses (Figure 1).",

In contrast, VP3-like proteins of the second subgroup show only $20% identity to each other and to homologues of the first subgroup members. The next protein encoded in the conserved cluster of genes is VP4-like major structural protein (Figure 1), forming the spike structure on the virion surface. This protein is processed during maturation. In order to predict the translation start site, the empirically determined N-termini (Table 1) together with Signal P and Tat find programs were used. Three of the manually annotated VP4-like protein precursors were predicted to have a twin-arginine signal sequence suggesting export of the protein in a folded state. Most of the VP4-like protein precursors share only $20% identity ( Supplementary  Table S8).

The single-stranded jX174 virion DNA and the nicked dsDNA replicative form RFII were used as controls to show specificities of different MBN concentrations.

In order to verify that the sites with the motif or its reverse complement contain discontinuous regions, we first tested two sites by performing Sanger sequencing of the HRPV-3 genomic DNA with the primers reading through the motif along both DNA strands. In both sites, the sequencing signal decreased dramatically after the GCCCA motif, suggesting a discontinuous region in the opposite strand. When the same genomic regions were sequenced from generated PCR template, the drop in sequencing signal was not observed. This suggests that the drop of signal is caused by an inherent discontinuous property of the HRPV-3 genome ( Figure 3B). In order to test the rest of the sites, we designed primers $100 nt upstream of the GCCCA motif when possible (Table S3). In 13 cases out of 19, a decrease in sequencing signal after the GCCCA motif was observed ( Figure 3C).

In addition to the four major nucleosides, two peaks appeared in the UV-chromatogram at 6.3 min and 9.9 min ( Figure 4C), the molecular masses of which correspond to methylated derivatives of cytidine and adenosine, respectively. Using the multiple fragmentation reaction monitoring (MRM) mode of the Triple Quadrupol, the fragmentation patterns of all nucleoside peaks were analysed. The mass transitions of the two methylated nucleosides ( Figure 4A and B) showed that the methylgroups are located on the base and not on the sugar moiety. Retention time and fragmentation of the peak at 6.3 min were identical to methylated nucleoside 5-methylcytidine (mC). The peak of the base-methylated adenosine at 9.9 min, also present in both viral DNA digests, corresponds most probably to N 6 -methyladenosine (mA) which is already well described (46). Figure 4C shows the chromatograms taken at 254 nm of the viral digests used for calculation of relative nucleoside amounts. Both viral digests contain similar amounts of mC (0.58% and 0.66%) and slightly different amounts of mA (0.20% and 1.35%).",

Thus, alternative start sites that retained the usual length of the signal peptides were chosen. Experimental data of the viral proteins also give us useful tools for assessing the original annotation of related proviral regions in haloarchaeal genomes. For example, the VP3 homologue of Hfx. volcanii DS2 (HVO_1432) has been annotated as a fibronectin type III domain (Fn3)-containing protein (47).

We define this region as a conserved gene cluster. Among the encoded proteins, VP3-like, VP8-like and ORF7-like gene products show the highest degree of conservation, and preliminary phylogenetic analyses suggest similar evolutionary histories for these proteins. The set of genome sequences described here, however, is still too small and diverse to enable a proper phylogenetic analysis of genes encoded by the conserved cluster and their products. Good examples for this are VP4-like proteins. As discussed before (20,23), the VP4-like proteins do not usually show high identity because they are likely to serve as receptor recognition proteins. Exceptions to this are the VP4-like proteins of HRPV-2, HRPV-3 and HRPV-6 ($50-60% identity, Supplementary Table S8). This case most probably reflects the correlation between the relatedness of the VP4-like protein and the hosts of these viruses (Halorubrum). HRPV-1 also infects a host strain that has been designated as Halorubrum sp., but the VP4 protein similarity to those of HRPV-2, HRPV-3 and HRPV-6 is much lower ($20%). Since the HRPV-1 VP4 is the only protein among the VP4-like proteins that is shown to be glycosylated and glycans are often involved in specific recognition events, glycosylation may be the factor responsible for the observed difference. Host may not be the only selection pressure on the VP4-like proteins, however, because the VP4-like proteins of HHPV-1 and His2 infecting Har. hispanica are rather diverged.",

The replicative form of the circular pleomorphic viral genomes is similar to the haloarchaeal plasmids. Thus, analogies to membrane vesicles containing plasmid DNA have been drawn (1,48). The pleomorphic viruses retard the host cell growth (6,20,21), which is also usual for many high-copy-number plasmids. Although the distinction between plasmids and replicating virus genomes can be difficult (49) and hybrids of plasmids and viruses have been reported (50), the pleomorphic haloarchaeal viruses described in this report fall into the category of viruses on the basis of at least two criteria. First, the replicon is packaged into a particle (51), and second, the replicon packaged encodes the structural proteins and the proteins required for the assembly of these particles.",

Viruses belonging to the second subgroup do not encode Rep. The third subgroup member, His2, is predicted to use protein-primed replication for its linear genome (5,52). Thus, this is yet another excellent example of the related viruses having adopted different genome types and possibly also replication strategies (20,51).",

Proviruses contain an integrase, and in most cases, we can identify a tRNA on the other end of the proviral region. The putative proviral regions usually have longer variable part of the genomes than the pleomorphic viruses do. It seems that the described pleomorphic viruses have systematically lost the integrase encoding genes and many putative genes from the regions with variable gene content. The only exception is HRPV-2 which still seems to have many putative genes that may not be necessary for the pleomorphic viral lifecycle sensu stricto.",

In HRPV-3 genome, they are preceded by a specific motif GCCCA. Localized single-strand interruptions have been identified before in the tailed 'phiKMV-like viruses' of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (53,54) and T5 (55)(56)(57). In those viruses, the discontinuities were shown to be nicks that were located in one strand only, and in phage jkF77, they were shown to be located in intergenic regions (54). The function of the nicks for earlier reported viruses is not known, and the candidates for gene products generating these nicks have been hypothesized to be of viral origin (54). The results obtained in this study show that the interruptions in HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 genomes are not nicks, but longer stretches of single-stranded DNA. Also, we do not have a candidate gene product for causing these interruptions in the HGPV-1 or HRPV-3 genome, and we speculate that in this case the putative enzyme is host encoded. Both HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 show methylation patterns of cytidine (mC) and adenosine (mA) which are well-known in DNA research and have not been found to influence the genomic integrity. Hence, there is no evidence that modified nucleosides are related to the discontinuous nature of the HRPV3 and HGPV1 virus genomes. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism causing these short stretches of ssDNA and most importantly to determine their biological function.",

His2 also contains homologues of the same conserved cluster of genes. Although His2 virus is currently grouped with spindle-shaped virus His1 to the genus Salterprovirus, these two viruses share only one homologue, type B DNA polymerase (5). This suggests that His2 virus is more closely related to haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses, than to spindle-shaped virus His1. A parallel study reports the analysis of virion morphology of these newly identified haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses and earlier reported His2 (5) by quantitative biochemical dissociation and electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) (21). It shows that the architectural principles of His2 are the same as those of the other haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses. Taken together, our results are consistent with the above-mentioned findings (21) and allow us to further classify the haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses into subgroups according to genome organization. On the basis of these results, we can now propose a new group of viruses, the group of seven pleomorphic haloarchaeal viruses, having similar principles of virion architecture, but different types of genomes.",
