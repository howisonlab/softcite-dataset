            "text": "Background: Schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (SPAH) is a major concern worldwide. However, the role of gender-specific contributing factors in SPAH is unknown. Objective: We investigated how systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) values and the presence of severe SPAP relate to gender, menopausal status, and pregnancy history in SPAH patients. Methods: Seventy-nine patients diagnosed with SPAH from 2000 to 2009 were assessed and 66 were enrolled in the study. Information about age, menopausal status, pregnancy, echocardiography-derived SPAP, and invasive mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was collected from medical records. The relation between values of SPAP and mPAP and their agreement for severe disease were assessed. Regression models assessed the association of gender, menopausal status, and pregnancy history with SPAP values and the presence of severe SPAP. Results: Moderate correlation and good agreement for severe disease were found between mPAP and SPAP. Mean SPAP values were similar for men and women. A trend toward higher values of SPAP was found for non-menopausal women compared to men. Higher SPAP values were found for menopausal compared to non-menopausal women; the values were non-significant after adjustment for age. Pregnancy history had no association with SPAP. Menopause and positive pregnancy had no association with severe SPAP. Conclusion: In SPAH patients, neither gender, nor menopausal status, nor pregnancy history showed independent correlation with SPAP values assessed by echocardiography.",

A similar predominance of females has been reported for other PAH etiologies, but the real influence of gender in PAH is still controversial. The higher prevalence of PAH in women compared to men, the thrombogenic effects of estrogen, and the fluctuation of estrogen metabolites may indicate potential negative effects of female physiology on the pulmonary vasculature 31,32 . Estrogen, however, also showed benefits for pulmonary vasculature in both acute and chronic experimental models of pulmonary hypertension 31,32 . We found similar values of SPAP in men and women with SPAH. Moreover, gender had no statistically significant predictive ability for SPAP when adjusted for age at diagnosis ( Table 2).",

Experimental models showed more severe pulmonary hypertension in chronically hypoxemic rodents that have had their ovaries removed than those with intact ovaries. In this study, the return of estrogens after an ovariectomy led to a regression to baseline levels of pulmonary pressure 36 . Moreover, a history of previous pregnancies showed prognostic value in pregnant patients with pulmonary hypertension 37 . We investigated how gender, menopausal status, and pregnancy history predicted severe SPAP values (> 120 mmHg) in SPAH patients, but found no statistically significant association (Table 3).",
