The Chinese experience of decentralizing SOEs confirms this insight: when the distance to the government is farther, the SOE is more likely to be decentralized, and this distance-decentralization link is more pronounced with higher communication costs and greater firm-performance heterogeneity. However, when the Chinese central government oversees SOEs in strategic industries, the distance-decentralization link is muted. We also consider alternative agency-cost-based explanations, and do not find much support."

The two key arguments for why capitalism is more efficient than planned economy are: stronger incentives under the more secure protection of private property rights and the efficiency of using specific information dispersed among individuals and plants (Boettke 2005). This second point originates from Hayek (1945), one of the most influential papers of all time. 2 The critical importance of incentives, ownership, and property rights for explaining performance in socialist and transitional economies is one of the most active areas of research (Megginson and Netter 2001;Djankov and Murrell 2002;Estrin et al. 2009). However, the importance of local information for the management of stateowned enterprises is rarely empirically explored.",

We rely on the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) 1998-2007, which covers all SOEs. Decentralization is defined as the oversight status of an SOE shifting from a higher-to a lower-level government. The availability of local information is captured by the physical distance between an SOE and the oversight government. A larger distance implies that the government has fewer direct observations on firm-specific information. This interpretation of distance is consistent with the recent literature in which the distance is found to capture information asymmetry in financial markets (Coval and Moskowitz 1999), to explain a headquarter's investment across its plants in different locations (Giroud 2013), and to shed light on the lending relationship between banks and firms (Petersen and Rajan 1994). Hayek (1945) implies it is more efficient for an oversight government with a greater distance from the SOE to decentralize the control rights to a lower government closer to the SOE. Moreover, when firms' performance heterogeneity is greater, and hence local information figures more prominently, the same distance results in a stronger tendency to decentralize in order to utilize local information. Furthermore, when the communication costs are lower, the oversight government has less difficulty finding out what is going on in the SOE, and the same distance may lead to a weaker tendency to decentralize (Bloom et al. 2014).",

The General de Gaulle government in France followed suit, declaring that the state \"must hold the levers of command.\" Similarly, after the independence of India, Prime Minister Nehru often evoked the commanding-heights metaphor. Typically, these countries, as well as Germany, Korea, Japan, many Latin American countries, and of course, all socialist countries, had strong state control/ownership over strategic sectors such as defense, iron and steel, railroads, ship-building, utilities, and telecom.

To exclude the possibility that distance to the government serves as a proxy of the distance to an agglomeration center, we construct a placebo distance to the alternative agglomeration city, and do not find this measure to be correlated with decentralization. To address distance's potential endogeneity, we rely on exogenous sources of variation of the distance to identify its effect on decentralization. In the 1960s and 1970s, a large number of SOEs were relocated to China's inland areas in anticipation of wars with the United States and the Soviet Union. As a result, their distances to oversight governments were determined historically and had nothing to do with decentralization decisions decades later.

However, only the Hayek conjecture predicts a higher distance-decentralization link in the presence of greater performance heterogeneity. Furthermore, the finding of the lack of relationship between the distance-decentralization link and the rent environment is consistent with the Hayek conjecture, but inconsistent with the oversight agency conjecture. Also supporting the Hayek conjecture is that the government initiated SOE reforms to turn around SOE performance in the mid-1990s."

First, we focus on the role of local information in SOE decentralization, and speak directly to Hayek's attempt to understand how local information shapes the choices of centralization versus decentralization for socialist firms. In the literature of socialist firms, there have been numerous studies of incentives and ownership (Megginson and Netter 2001;Djankov and Murrell 2002;Estrin et al. 2009), but none documents the key aspect of how the lack of local information affects the governance of socialist firms (Boettke 2005).

The theoretical literature on decentralization of firms is large. Aghion and Tirole (1997) show it is efficient to delegate when the information advantage of agents is significant and the conflict of interest is not large. Garicano (2000) suggests that it makes sense to create a hierarchy of knowledge production (see also Bolton and Dewatripont 1994). Dessein (2002) and Alonso, Dessein, and Matouschek (2008) argue that when agents report information strategically, it is often desirable for an uninformed principal to delegate. These theoretical papers greatly enrich the insights of Hayek (1945) by providing further rationales for decentralization, both highlighting factors that Hayek considered, such as agent information advantage (Aghion and Tirole 1997), and those that Hayek did not consider, such as specialization in information acquisition, hierarchy of knowledge production, conflicts of interest between principals and agents (Aghion and Tirole 1997), and strategic reporting by agents (Dessein 2002;Alonso, Dessein, and Matouschek 2008). In contrast to the large theoretical literature on decentralization, the empirical literature is limited. Thus, while we cannot directly test the implications of these new models, by testing the simple yet powerful implications of Hayek (1945), we contribute to the emerging empirical literature on decentralization of firms (Acemoglu et al. 2007;Bloom et al. 2014;Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen 2012;Giroud 2013;Aghion et al. 2017).",

Each government of a specific level is in charge of all the SOEs affiliated with that government. 6 Decentralization of Chinese SOEs became an important option for SOE reforms as the government confronted SOE losses and tried to improve SOE performance. After China began its economic reform in 1978, market competition quickly intensified coincident with a rise of the private sector (Brandt and Rawski 2008). As a result, the profits and taxes per unit of net capital stock and working capital in industrial SOEs had fallen from 24 percent in 1978 to 7 percent in 1996 (Qian 2000), and more than one-third of SOEs had losses in 1996. Realizing the necessity of further reforms, some oversight governments experimented with decentralizing SOEs in order to improve efficiency. 7 For instance, State Economic and Trade Commission et al. (1994) stated that \"the adjustment of the oversight status of SOEs should aim for \u2026 optimizing the allocation of state assets, and improving operating efficiency of capital.\" 8 Partly due to its local-experiment nature, the decentralization process proceeded unevenly. Based on our sample, which includes all SOEs, decentralization happened throughout our sample period: the annual numbers of SOEs being decentralized from 1999 to 2007 are 235,200,250,149,204,280,102,59, and 37, respectively. We focus on decentralizations after 1998, which is the earliest year with detailed data of all SOEs.",

            "text": "Decentralization was one of many methods for SOE reforms beginning in the second half of the 1990s. The slogan of overall SOE reform then was \"grab the big and let go of the small\" (Xu, Zhu, and Lin 2005;Hsieh and Song 2015). With limited attention span and information processing ability, the upper government decided to focus its attention on key SOEs. To \"grab the big,\" many large SOEs were merged to form industrial conglomerates, and the control rights over such firms were consolidated to the central government. To \"let go of the small,\" many SOEs were privatized, or went through internal restructuring, bankruptcy, employee shareholding, auctions, leasing, and joint ventures (Garnaut et al. 2005, Chapter 3); others were delegated to lower-level governments, i.e., decentralized. In implementing SOE reforms, the central government offered general guidelines but left significant room for the oversight governments to experiment (Qian, Roland, and Xu 2006;Brandt and Rawski 2008). The State Reform Commission (1996), for instance, stated that the reform of small SOEs should respect local conditions of each region, and that the local government was encouraged to experiment with various means. 9 The decentralization decision, once made by the oversight government, could not be refused by its lower governments. Because of its power to appoint government officials, the higher-level government had total control over its lower levels, and the decentralization decision was thus made by the incumbent oversight government. Some provinces explicitly stated that no city had the right to resist the implementation of SOE decentralization (e.g., Chongqing Government 1997).",

Like a decentralized western corporation, the decision-making authority in China's state sector moves down the hierarchy after decentralization. While the plant manager in a corporation, after delegation, may take sub-optimal actions at the cost of the firm (Alonso, Dessein, and Matouschek 2008;Dessein 2002), China's SOE decentralization partly alleviated this problem. Because cash flow rights were also transferred to the local government after decentralization, the Chinese local government would partially internalize the costs and benefits of governing the decentralized SOEs. 10 The complete delegation in various rights is well-documented. State Council (1998), for instance, states that, \"after decentralization, all rights regarding the SOE's finance, labor, wage, social welfare, and personnel are transferred to the local government; also transferred include state asset, liability, equity \u2026 further transferred are the loss and subsidy quotas \u2026 ; after decentralization, all income taxes are \u2026 turned to local public finance.\" 9 Some provinces explicitly listed decentralization as an option. In Shandong province, the explicit reform methods were franchising, privatization, transfer, decentralization, merger and acquisition, and bankruptcy (Shandong Government 2003). In Jiangxi province, decentralization was also listed as one of several reform methods (Jiangxi Government 2007).",

Realizing this, the manager is more likely to report honestly, which further improves the quality of knowledge received by the government (Alonso, Dessein, and Matouschek 2008). A shorter distance should then result in a higher likelihood of centralized control. In contrast, the greater the distance between the SOE and the oversight government, the larger the loss of useful (and truthful) local information critical for efficient allocation decisions, and the more likely the SOE is decentralized to preserve efficiency. Interestingly, Chinese governments were aware of this relationship between distance and need for decentralization.

When the principal faces higher performance heterogeneity, firm-specific local information becomes more important and the oversight rights should be given to the government closer to the firm. The positive distance-decentralization link should thus be stronger for firms with greater firm-performance heterogeneity. Similarly, when communication costs between the SOE and its oversight government are higher, the principal faces more information asymmetry (Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen 2012;Garicano 2000;Giroud 2013).

Many governments have since followed this philosophy, strengthening direct control of the economy, most notably during the period from the Great Depression to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Such governments included the Attlee Labour government in the United Kingdom, the de Gaulle government in France (both immediately after World War II), as well as India, Germany, Korea, Japan, many Latin American countries, and of course, all socialist countries. 11 The Chinese central government has always maintained a strong control of its commanding heights. Indeed, \"national interests\" have often been mentioned in Chinese government's documents about SOEs. In 2006, the State Council's document on the reorganization of SOEs (State Council 2006) stated, \"the state should maintain absolute control over important industries that are related to national security and national economic growth.\" A priori, several features make strategic objectives more salient for the central rather than for local governments.

Proximity magnifies the private benefits associated with being directly in charge, partly due to greater trust between the SOE and its oversight-government officials. As a result, the government wants to keep nearby SOEs, which lowers the chance of their decentralization. Moreover, when communication costs are higher, rent extraction from distant SOEs would be more difficult, and direct control of these distant SOEs becomes less enticing, resulting in a higher chance of decentralization for SOEs at a greater distance. Thus, the positive distance-decentralization link should be stronger for SOEs facing higher communication costs. Similarly, under the assumption of easier rent extraction in nearby SOEs, when SOE rents are higher, rent extraction from nearby SOEs is relatively more appealing, resulting in a stronger distance-decentralization link in high-rent environments.

When the distance is short, collusion is more likely and sustainable. Physical proximity enables more interaction, trust, channels of mutual influence, and ultimately, sustained collusion. The key factor in local capture is the SOE-Lower distance; where this distance is shorter, it is easier for Lower and the SOE manager to collude for rents. Lower thus lobbies for decentralization. As a result, decentralization becomes more likely with a shorter SOE-to-Lower distance. Moreover, when the SOE has abundant rents to share, Lower finds it more enticing to collude with the SOE, and is more motivated to lobby for decentralization. Thus, the negative relationship between decentralization and the distance to Lower should be more pronounced when the rents are higher. In sum, the local capture conjecture predicts a negative link between decentralization and the distance to Lower, and a negative interaction term between the distance to Lower and proxies of rents. Interestingly, the Hayek conjecture also predicts a negative link between decentralization and the distance to Lower: the efficiency gain is higher when the distance between the SOE and Lower is shorter. The Hayek conjecture, however, does not speak directly to the relationship between the decentralization-distance link and the rent environment.",

The vector Z lag measures lagged province-level variables: GDP per capita, unemployment rate, and share of SOEs in total urban employment. When computing the lag of a variable, we use the average of its onceand twice-lagged values to take into account multiple periods' information. Besides the industry and the year dummies, we also control for the 363 dummy variables indicating the oversight government of the SOE to hold constant oversight-specific tendency to decentralize. 18 To allow for correlation of the error term across time and space, we cluster the standard errors at the initial oversight government level. Since decentralization is mostly irreversible in our sample, we delete those observations after Decen has turned one. We consider the possibility of multiple decentralizations per firm later. Our main parameter of interest is the marginal effect of Distance. Its estimate is based on comparison between SOEs with different distances to the original oversight government.",

When examining decentralization by each oversight, we address the concern that the extent of decentralization at each oversight level could differ, in which case it is unclear if the decentralization dummy captures similar extent of delegation for SOEs under different oversight levels. We find that distance is robustly and positively correlated with decentralization whether using the full or the oversight-specific samples. Using the pooled sample estimates, increasing the distance by one standard deviation (SD, here 2.40) would increase the probability of decentralization by 1.3 percentage points, or 9 percent of the SD of the dependent variable. For the central, the provincial, and the municipal SOEs, increasing the distance by 1 SD (1.66, 1.74, and 1.57) would increase the probability of decentralization by 0.78, 0.64, and 0.71 percentage points, or 4 percent, 4 percent, and 6 percent of the SD of the dependent variable. In addition, decentralization is more likely for smaller, poorly-performing, and less important firms (see column 1). 20 Restructuring Options.-In our baseline estimation, we focus on decentralization. But an SOE could face other restructuring options (including privatizations). 21 For those SOEs that were eventually restructured, some observations are left out of our previous estimation: in the case of SOEs being restructured but never decentralized, all the restructuring years; in the case of SOEs being restructured after decentralization, all the post-decentralization years. This could be problematic if ignoring simultaneous choices of decentralization and restructuring might bias the estimate of the distance effect. We thus examine whether our results hold when considering both decentralization and restructuring.",

The number of SOEs disappearing from the sample (\"exit\") in the middle of the survey (7,183) far exceeds that experiencing explicit privatization (4,060). Because we cannot capture most privatizations, in this check we lump explicit privatizations with \"exit\" and call such SOEs Restructured.

Columns 1\u22124 of panel A report the marginal effect from the probit regressions. Column 5 reports the results from a Cox proportional hazard model. Columns 6-7 report results from a multinomial logit (MLogit) model: for each firm in year t, there are three possible outcomes, with \"neither restructured nor decentralized\" being the base. The two columns report the marginal effect of each explanatory variable on the probability of being Decentralized and being Restructured, respectively. When computing the lag of a variable, we use the average of its once-and twice-lagged values to take into account multiple periods' information. The samples used in the probit and MLogit specifications differ in two ways. First, for those eventually-restructured SOEs, the MLogit model contains observations in their first year after restructuring, while the probit model does not. Second, the MLogit model also includes the post-decentralization years for the central and provincial SOEs, because once decentralized, they still face the choice of being further decentralized (and being restructured). Panel B performs robustness checks using the probit model. Columns 1-3 are the results for the subsamples of the central, the provincial, and the municipal SOEs, respectively, with additional controls for per capita GDP, fiscal revenue, and fiscal autonomy of both the incumbent oversight government and the lower-level government. Columns 4-5 use the subsamples of fully state-owned and of partially-privatized SOEs, respectively. optimal one. For this exercise we keep the post-decentralization observations and expand the sample up to the restructuring years for the SOEs that were eventually restructured during the sample years. 22 The results are in columns 6 and 7 of panel A of Table 3. 23 The coefficient of log distance remains positive and statistically significant, with a marginal effect on the probability of decentralization of 0.0053, similar to our baseline estimate. Our result on the distance-decentralization link thus remains robust. In contrast, the distance coefficient for Restructured is small and statistically insignificant. 24 A related check is to delete those SOEs that were eventually restructured. Now the choices are \"no change\" and \"decentralization.\" We re-estimate the base specification using this smaller sample, and the coefficient of log distance remains positive and statistically significant (see Table E-2 in online Appendix E).",

            "text": "To deal with endogeneity, we rely on an instrumental variable (IV) that captures exogenous variations in the SOE-government distance. We take advantage of the fact that, being worried about potential wars with the United States and the Soviet Union during the 1960s and 1970s, China relocated many SOEs to her hinterland. This migration of firms is called the Third Front Construction program (TFC, see online Appendix I), which covered a large area in China. The relocation sites were chosen to be far away from external threats. It is implausible that, other than through the channel of the distance to the government, the TFC affiliation would affect SOE decentralization three to four decades later-after all, China's central leadership had changed several times, and the new leaders had distinct objectives. Because TFC covered 13 provinces and 5.9 percent of firms in our sample, this instrument is likely a relevant one. We thus construct a dummy variable TFC, which is one if a firm was established during the TFC period (i.e., 1964-1966 and 1969-1971) and in the TFC regions. Notes: Standard errors clustered at the oversight-government level are reported in the parentheses. Columns 1-2 report results on placebo distance using the probit model. Placebo distance is defined as the distance from Shanghai for the central SOEs, the distance from the largest city within the province (except for the provincial capital) for provincial SOEs, and the distance from the largest county-level city within the municipality (except for the municipal seat) for municipal SOEs. Column 2 excludes the provincial and municipal SOEs located in the same jurisdiction with the jurisdictional capital as the sole agglomeration city. Columns 3-4 report results using TFC as the instrument. Column 3 reports the first stage results. Column 4 reports the linear probability IV estimates (i.e., 2SLS) and the associated test statistics. The control variables are the same as in Table 3. A key concern for a valid IV is that it is correlated with the unobserved factors behind the outcome. One way to shed light on (but not prove) the excludability is to examine if the IV is related to other known determinants of the outcome in sensible ways (Altonji, Elder, and Taber 2005). To see this, we regress TFC on other covariates in the decentralization decision (see Table J-1 of online Appendix J). The coefficients of the firm size, full state ownership, and income are statistically significant, not surprisingly since we know that TFC moved larger SOEs to inland (and thus lower-income) regions. In contrast, the coefficients of the key current determinants of decentralization, profitability, and Firm Importance, are statistically insignificant. These results, along with the historical origin of TFC, suggest that TFC is indeed likely excludable.",

            "text": "China's decentralization of SOEs provides a unique opportunity to test the implications of Hayek's insight on the importance of local information for designing economic systems. As the quote from Hayek suggests, when a society experiences rapid changes, the ultimate decisions should be left to those familiar with the particular circumstances, and \"some form of decentralization\" is needed. Indeed, we find that a larger information asymmetry between the SOE and the original oversight government, as proxied by their physical distance, is associated with a greater likelihood of decentralization. Moreover, the positive effect of distance on decentralization is larger where SOE performance is more heterogeneous and the communication costs are higher. Our findings suggest that Hayek's insight on local information is indeed a key for understanding both the organization of firms and the working of economic systems. Our findings also suggest that when the central government decides to control the commanding heights, the Hayek conjecture loses much of its explanatory power. This group of commanding-heights SOEs represented about 5 percent of industrial 32 See Table 1 for definition. Some may question whether the provincial proxy of corruption would work for the central SOEs. We do not think this is an issue because the central SOEs are physically located in their specific provinces, and their rent-seeking tendency would be influenced by the local norms of corruption (Fisman and Miguel 2007). We have tried dropping the central SOEs to ensure our proxy of local corruption is accurate, and the key results remain similar. 33 The negative and statistically significant coefficient of the interaction term between the distance to the oversight government and lagged firm ROS is in fact opposite to what the oversight agency conjecture predicts. output in China. The Chinese experience of managing its SOEs thus demonstrates the dual goals of the government: efficiency and controlling commanding heights. We also consider, but do not find strong support for, the agency-costs-based explanations.",
