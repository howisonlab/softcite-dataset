By the time symptoms appear, it may already be too late to prevent a severe course, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality. We aimed to develop a rapid test of lung maturity for targeting surfactant supplementation. Methods: Concentrations of the most surface-active lung phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in gastric aspirates from premature infants were measured by mass spectrometry and expressed as the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio (L/S). The same aspirates were analysed with mid-infrared spectroscopy. Subsequently, L/S was measured in gastric aspirates and oropharyngeal secretions from another group of premature infants using spectroscopy and the results were compared with RDS development. The 10-minute analysis required 10 lL of aspirate. Results: An L/S algorithm was developed based on 89 aspirates. Subsequently, gastric aspirates were sampled in 136 infants of 24-31 weeks of gestation and 61 (45%) developed RDS. The cutoff value of L/S was 2.2, sensitivity was 92%, and specificity was 73%. In 59 cases, the oropharyngeal secretions had less valid L/S than gastric aspirate results. Conclusion: Our rapid test for lung maturity, based on spectroscopy of gastric aspirate, predicted RDS with high sensitivity.",

            "text": "premature infants with a gestational age of less than 30 weeks have immature lungs and approximately half still require treatment with surfactant when treated with nCPAP or mechanical ventilation (1,2). In recent years, there have been several improvements in treatment, which have helped reduce the incidence and severity of RDS and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Minimal use of oxygen in the delivery room (3) and in the neonatal period is an important development in care. Very early treatment with nCPAP, combined with minimal use of mechanical ventilation, especially during initial treatment, reduces ventilator-induced lung damage and is now widely used (4,5). Over the years, early rescue treatment with surfactant has been strongly associated with a more favourable outcome compared to late rescue treatment (6)(7)(8). Better outcomes are also seen with a combination of nCPAP and surfactant (7,8). Finally, less invasive administration of surfactant via a thin catheter has emerged as an alternative method, especially in the most preterm infants (9). However, we need to treat selectively with surfactant, and very soon after birth, in order to substantially improve the prognosis of RDS and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In many cases, this needs to happen before symptoms are present. In order to do so, we need a bedside test that can quickly identify which infants have surfactant deficiency to target treatment effectively (10). Prophylactic treatment has been widely used, but it has been shown to increase the combined mortality and incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (11).",

These fluids are partially produced in the foetal lungs as well as in the kidneys and the amniotic sac and therefore contain lung surfactant (15). The classic method to determine surfactant in amniotic fluid has been measuring lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio (L/S) with thinlayer chromatography (12,16). Sphingomyelin secretion remains fairly constant during pregnancy, whereas lecithin secretion increases in parallel with lung maturation. Consequently, L/S reflects lung maturity independently of dilution sampling effects (12). However, this well-known diagnostic procedure to measure lung surfactant is slow and complex (16).",

Previously, we have measured the surfactant content in gastric aspirate with microbubble stability tests (19) and with lamellar body counts (20). We also conducted a randomised trial in very preterm infants with early surfactant guided by lamellar body counts in gastric aspirate versus traditional surfactant treatment (21). Use of lamellar body counts as a guide for early surfactant treatment led to a significant reduction in the need of oxygen at six hours of age and by day 28. Furthermore, the time on oxygen therapy was reduced and there was a trend towards a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The earlier that the lamellar body counts were measured, the better the outcome. Dilution, however, was a problem with both the microbubble stability test and lamellar body counts. Furthermore, both these methods, and similar tests, are labour and laboratory intensive and require a minimum of two to three hours for analysis. This makes these methods less suitable for use as bedside tests.",

Only a few are still in use, and they all have significant drawbacks, such as lack of specificity and sensitivity or a demand for skilled laboratory personnel and a long delay before the test results are available. Therefore, there is still an urgent unmet need for a quick and safe test to identify   which newborn infants require surfactant. We have developed a fast method that does not require highly trained laboratory personnel and can be further developed to a point-of-care test. We chose to use gastric aspirates and oropharyngeal secretions, which are easy to obtain, and a process that does not require the use of complicated reagents. More clinical factors may influence the development of RDS and the lung maturity test. For example, the second twin often has a lower L/S than the first-born infant. This tendency is also seen in the actual study.",

A possible explanation is that L/S in gastric aspirate after Caesarean section originates from a mix of amniotic fluid and newly produced lung fluid, both with different L/S, in contrast to L/S in gastric aspirate from infants born vaginally. We found it conceivable that swallowed amniotic fluid to some degree may be squeezed out of the stomach during natural birth as opposed to birth by Caesarean section. Accordingly, gastric aspirate obtained immediately after a vaginal birth may contain a higher proportion of newly swallowed fluid from the lungs.",

The efficacy of nCPAP may alleviate or mask symptoms of RDS, making the diagnosis of RDS challenging, but it would be unethical to withhold treatment with nCPAP. In our study, 40% of the infants with non-RDS and L/S values below the cut-off required supplemental oxygen during the first nine hours of life, while infants with non-RDS and higher L/S values had no need for oxygen. This makes it probable that some infants with low L/S values, who were graded as non-RDS, actually had subclinical surfactant deficiency. It has also been shown that nCPAP can increase L/S in repeated hypopharyngeal secretions (26). We previously developed two different methods for early diagnosis of RDS on gastric aspirate from infants similar to the population in the present study receiving early nCPAP (18,19). These previously developed tests, like our new method, had specificity that was lower than sensitivity, supporting the suggestion that nCPAP may mask less pronounced surfactant deficiency.",

Gestational age and L/S were lower in all groups of RDS compared to non-RDS. What is also remarkable is that there was no distinct correlation between gestational age and L/S, probably reflecting that gestational age only accounted for a smaller fraction of the total variation in the result of the lung maturity test (20,27). This was also supported by the higher sensitivity and specificity of L/S compared to gestational age when used as a predictor of RDS. Surfactant treatment in the actual study, as judged by clinical observations, was given after a median of six hours and only four infants were treated an hour or less after birth. This indicates that fast determination of L/S by a bedside test is likely to allow earlier diagnosis of RDS and earlier rescue treatment with surfactant compared to rescue surfactant treatment based on routine clinical criteria.",

Consequently, we also analysed L/S in oropharyngeal secretion. The fluid was taken noninvasively and close to the oral cavity. The specificity of L/S in the oropharyngeal secretions was equal to the specificity in the gastric aspirates, but the sensitivity for the oropharyngeal secretions was lower than for the gastric aspirates. We expect that the sampling technique can be optimised and that fresh oropharyngeal secretions and gastric aspirates will be easier to process than frozen ones. Stichtenoth et al. (29) measured surface tension in upper airway aspirates and found acceptable correlations to lung maturity. However, the processing time was rather long and the dilution of the surfactant may have interfered with the surface tension measurements. Others have also successfully performed L/S analyses on hypopharyngeal secretions (14,26), but by using methods that were slower and less accurate. The use of spectroscopy to measure L/S on amniotic fluid was initially explored by Liu et al. (30). This method held promise for rapid measurements of lung maturity in the laboratory, but the low accuracy of the reference method, which was carried out by thin-layer chromatography, proved to be a fundamental problem (16). The increased foetal loss after amniocentesis, together with improvements in newborn respiratory care, obviates wide use of the method.",
