Fifteen patients with DTC, abnormal thyroglobulin levels, and negative 131 I-dWBS findings were scanned using the 18 F-FDG PET/CT. Positive diagnosis was based on postoperative histologic findings, and clinical and imaging follow-up results obtained in the subsequent 6 months. In addition, preoperative and postoperative thyroglobulin levels were compared. Using the findings of 18 F-FDG PET/CT and data on confirmed positive diagnosis, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated. Sensitivity and PPV of PET/CT in detecting recurrence or metastasisization of DTC were 93.30 and 91.40%, respectively. Furthermore, postoperative thyroglobulin levels were markedly lower compared to the preoperative levels (respectively, 4.67\u00b11.71 vs. 58.53\u00b118.34 ng/ml; p<0.05). PET/CT scan with 18 F-FDG is an informative technique for the detection of recurrent or metastasized DTC in patients with abnormal thyroglobulin levels and negative 131 I-dWBS findings. 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging. The Philips GXL 16 PET/CT scanning instrument (Philips Medical Systems, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) was used. The patients fasted for \u22656 h prior to scanning. Strict blood glucose levels (non-diabetic patients, <6.1 mmol/l; patients with diabetes, <8.3 mmol/l) were maintained. The patients were intravenously administered 270-370 MBq of",

            "text": "The incidence of thyroid carcinoma is the highest among head and neck carcinomas. Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) accounts for 90% of thyroid cancers, with 20% of patients experiencing disease relapse, which decreases survival rates (1). A timely diagnosis of thyroid cancer recurrence is critical. Evaluation of serum thyroglobulin and 131 I-diagnostic whole-body scanning (dWBS) are the most commonly employed detection techniques. However, 15-20% of patients with abnormal thyroglobulin levels show negative findings on 131 I-dWBS (2,3). Furthermore, it is difficult to differentiate the recurrence of DTC from cicatricial tissue by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (4). Subsequently, PET/CT has been introduced in the diagnostics of DTC, since PET/CT shows metabolic activity and anatomical abnormalities, characteristic of the tumour.",

Elevated thyroglobulin levels indicate recurrence or metastasization, resulting in 131 I-dWBS scans being able to locate the tumour. When 131 I-dWBS shows negative findings, B-mode ultrasound, CT, MRI, PET or other imaging techniques are used to localize recurrent or metastatic tumour. The first three methods are mainly used to locate the tumour by anatomical abnormalities, while PET reveals the tumour through metabolic abnormalities (6). Each of these techniques has its advantages and limitations. By contrast, PET/CT imaging can simultaneously reveal metabolic status and anatomical location of the lesion, thus combining the advantages of PET and CT (7). This technique is useful in difficult diagnoses, such as that for postoperative scars or nodules, which lack typical benign or malignant signs. Malignant tumours consume glucose at 10-fold higher rates than normal or scar tissue, and this feature enables precise differential diagnosis in those cases (8). Therefore, combined functional and morphological examination during PET/CT can improve the ability to detect recurrent and metastatic tumours (9).",

Sensitivity and PPV for recurrence and metastasization of DTC range from 66 to 93.3% and from 87.5 to 100%, respectively (11)(12)(13). These values are significantly higher than those achieved by B-mode ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET alone. In the present study, sensitivity and PPV were 93.33 and 91.43%, respectively, for patients with positive thyroglobulin levels and negative 131 I-dWBS findings. This is in agreeement with previous findings (14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19). In such patients, metastatic tumour is more aggressive, which leads to elevation of the sensitivity of 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging. However, tumours that uptake iodine do not uptake FDG, therefore, 18 F-FDG PET/CT cannot fully replace 131 I-dWBS and should not be recommended for routine screening for recurrent or metastatic DTC.",
