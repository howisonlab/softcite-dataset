            "text": "Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition usually diagnosed in childhood and affecting 1 in 400 children < 20 years of age. 1 Its management requires daily blood glucose monitoring, insulin administration, carbohydrate counting, and physical activity monitoring. Many adolescents experience a decline in glycemic control; recent studies have shown that only 14% of adolescents with type 1 diabetes meet the American Diabetes Association's glycemic control recommendations. 2,3 Furthermore, the novelty and utility of behavioral interventions delivered in person have often plateaued by adolescence. 4,5 Mobile technology may offer a particularly useful way to deliver health information to adolescents. Indeed, 77% of adolescents own a mobile phone, 63% communicate via text messages daily, and adolescents are amenable to receiving health information via text messages. 6,7 A recent review of the literature regarding text message interventions for youths with type 1 diabetes indicated that texting to teens with diabetes is feasible and can be enjoyable to youths; 8 however, the text message programs had limitations: many did not require participants to respond, did not allow researchers to monitor text message receipt, provided access to a cell phone as an incentive, and included non-text message intervention components. Further systematic analysis of the feasibility of text message programs for adolescents with type 1 diabetes is warranted.",

For example, both Franklin et al. 14 and Mulvaney et al. 15 reported on text message programs that included the development of personal type 1 diabetes profiles and goals for each participant during clinic appointments, which were then used to select appropriate texts. Hanauer et al. 10 included the medical team in their program, such that adolescents received health care recommendations by text if the blood glucose level they submitted was out of range. Although these programs are more time-intensive to develop and coordinate and require the participation of additional medical team members, preliminary A1C results and participant satisfaction indicate that these efforts may have a positive impact on outcomes.",

Although parents did not receive text messages in the current study, parents of participants provided feedback that they wanted to receive educational type 1 diabetes texts as well. Others mentioned that they would appreciate type 1 diabetes clinic appointment and/or prescription reminders via text message. Additionally, the SMART Project did not provide adolescents with feedback regarding their responses. Engagement and response rates may increase if a health care provider is available to review responses and provide real-time feedback (e.g., respond to high or low blood glucose levels with reminders about hyper-and hypoglycemia management). Finally, it will be important to determine whether SMART Project texts changed patients' type 1 diabetesrelated behavior.",
