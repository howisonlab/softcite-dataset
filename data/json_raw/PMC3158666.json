Study design and participants Observational cohort study of children presenting with suspected infection to an emergency department in England. Detailed data were collected prospectively on presenting clinical features, laboratory investigations and outcome. Clinical predictors of serious bacterial infection (SBI) were explored in multivariate logistic regression models using part of the dataset, each model was then validated in an independent part of the dataset, and the best model was chosen for derivation of a clinical risk score for SBI. The ability of this score to risk stratify children with SBI was then assessed in the entire dataset. Main outcome measure Final diagnosis of SBI according to criteria defi ned by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health working group on Recognising Acute Illness in Children. Results Data from 1951 children were analysed. 74 (3.8%) had SBI. The sensitivity of individual clinical signs was poor, although some were highly specifi c for SBI. A score was derived with reasonable ability to discriminate SBI (area under the receiver operator characteristics curve 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.83) and risk stratify children with suspected SBI. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential utility of a clinical score in risk stratifying children with suspected SBI. Further work should aim to validate the score and its impact on clinical decision making in different settings, and ideally incorporate it into a broader management algorithm including additional investigations to further stratify a child's risk.",

            "text": "Serious bacterial infections (SBIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children worldwide. A recent review of child deaths in England, Wales and Northern Ireland confi rmed that the largest single cause of death in children dying of an acute physical illness was infection, and found evidence that healthcare professionals in both hospital and primary care had diffi culty identifying serious illness in children. 1 In another study of over 400 children with meningococcal sepsis in the UK, only half were referred to hospital at their fi rst primary care consultation, usually after a delay of several hours following the fi rst symptoms and/or signs of sepsis. 2 Early recognition of SBIs is associated with better treatment outcomes 3 4 but is challenging as many of the early clinical features also occur in self-limiting illnesses. In developed countries, discriminating serious infection from self-limiting illness i s further complicated by the low prevalence of serious infection in children presenting to hospital emergency departments as well as primary care settings. 5 Better clinical tools are therefore required to improve the recognition of children with serious acute illness, particularly SBIs. 1 6 7 Clinical prediction rules utilising key clinical features to generate a diagnostic or prognostic score are increasingly used to risk stratify patients in a wide variety of clinical situations, particularly those in which diagnostic decisions are complicated, and in some areas have had a major impact on clinical service delivery. 8 -15 We aimed to develop a simple clinical score with the ability to risk stratify children with possible SBIs presenting to a paediatric emergency department.",

Furthermore, focusing on children with suspected SBI rather than all children with serious illness allowed inclusion of clinical risk factors specifi c to infection, and may have helped improve model specifi city. It is important to stress that while the SBI score should be generalisable to emergency departments in the developed world, it is unlikely to be applicable to developing world settings where the prevalence of SBI among paediatric presentations is much higher and there may be other important risk factors for infection such as malnutrition and HIV. 5 A potential limitation of the study concerns the defi nition of SBI. No single, reliable gold standard exists for the diagnosis of invasive bacterial infections in children. Although cultures from blood and other sterile sites are highly specifi c, sensitivity is limited. 45 -47 The defi nition of SBI used has been formulated to take account of all available clinical and laboratory information in defi ning each clinical syndrome, including a child's response to treatment, and is designed to capture all children with invasive or otherwise SBIs who require admission to hospital. A potential criticism is the risk of incorporation bias, since clinicians are not blind to the admission   Table 5 sho ws risks of serious bacterial infection stratifi ed by SBI score.",

Nevertheless, we believe the definition adopted represents a pragmatic working defi nition of SBI. Importantly, we were also able to identify those children discharged from hospital who re-attended within a week, and to amend their SBI classifi cation as required. While we cannot exclude the possibility that other children may have re-presented elsewhere, the nearest emergency department, which does not have a dedicated paediatric section, is 18 miles away, so the chance of this is small. Similarly, since sudden childhood death is rare in this population and most cases are brought to hospital, the chance of a child in this study dying at home and not re-attending hospital is also small. Missing data also limit the power of our analysis. Although the proportion of data missing for individual variables was generally small, this became more signifi cant in the multivariate analysis. Blood pressure is not routinely measured in paediatric clinical practice except in the sickest children, so data were missing for most patients. Nevertheless, blood pressure may have an important role in predicting SBI that this analysis would not be able to identify. The number of children for whom age data were missing is unfortunate as it further limits study power; however, this is unlikely to have introduced any bias since the underlying problem (poor legibility of the proforma) is unlikely to be related to the clinical presentation and was not associated with SBI.",

First, the specifi city of some clinical signs for SBI (such as reduced activity or level of consciousness, prolonged capillary refi ll time and reduced skin turgor) support the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical guidelines 7 which use these clinical features as 'red fl ags' to identify seriously ill children. The presence of these features in a febrile child should prompt a careful clinical assessment. Second, it clearly demonstrates the potential utility of a clinical score to stratify children according to their risk of SBI. Such a score might be incorporated into electronic decision support and medical records. Finally, it underlines the need to use such a clinical score as part of a broader algorithm to guide management decisions (including additional investigations, plans for review or admission for observation) to further stratify a child's risk. Future research should explore the benefi t of including in the model other risk factors such as immunisation status, routine blood pressure measurement, and other potential markers of sepsis such as limb pain or cool peripheries, 2 investigate how laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and white blood cell count may best be incorporated into a clinical algorithm to refi ne a child's risk status, and further validate the performance and impact 14 48 of the score in different acute paediatric settings, including primary care.",
