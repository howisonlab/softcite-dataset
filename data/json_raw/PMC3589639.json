We report a rare case of an 8-yr-old girl who presented with refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC) that transformed into ALL only 3 months after the diagnosis of childhood MDS. Although no cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in conventional karyotype and FISH analysis, we found several deletions on chromosomes 5q, 12q, 13q, and 22q. Partial homozygous deletion of the RB1 gene was observed on microarray analysis, with the bone marrow specimen diagnosed as ALL. This is the first case report of transformation of ALL from childhood MDS in Korea. We also compared the clinical, cytological, and cytogenetic features of 4 previously reported childhood MDS cases that transformed into ALL."

            "text": "MDS is a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by bone marrow (BM) failure, dysplasia of peripheral blood and BM cells, and a high risk of transforming into an acute leukemic phase [1]. MDS occurs as a result of ongoing DNA damage, natural depletion of stem cells, and accumulated exposure of the BM to environmental stresses or toxins [2]. Thus, the risk of MDS increases with age. Childhood MDS is relatively rare compared to adult MDS [3]. The incidence of childhood MDS is less than 5% of all hematologic malignancies in childhood [4,5].",

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was slightly increased at 5.3 mg/L (reference interval, 0-5.0 mg/L). Urinalysis results were not specific except a few WBCs, 3-5/high-power field."

            "text": "MDS originates from a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell with the potential for myeloid and lymphoid differentiation [11]. Based on flow cytometric immunophenotyping, approximately 85% of blast cells in the leukemic transformation from MDS displayed a myeloid phenotype, while 15% of blast cells displayed a hybrid (myeloid-lymphoid) phenotype. It is extremely rare for www.annlabmed.org only the lymphoid phenotype to be displayed [12,13]. Previous studies have suggested 2 reasons for the rarity of transformation to ALL from MDS. First, stem cells of MDS may have lymphopoietic potential as well as myelopoietic potential, but there may be specific impairment of lymphopoiesis by intrinsic or extrinsic factors. Second, the rarity of the development of ALL from MDS may reflect a relative deficiency of MDS-derived target cells capable of lymphoid leukemogenesis [14][15][16]. Transformation to ALL is extremely rare in MDS patients. In adults, several cases of lymphoid transformation from MDS have been reported [17][18][19][20][21][22]. However, there are only a few case reports of transformation of childhood MDS to ALL worldwide [8][9][10]. The profiles of our case and the previously reported 3 similar cases are shown in Table 1. In 1996, Bader-Meunier et al. [8] described the clinical, cytological, and cytogenetic features of one childhood MDS patient, a 4-yr-old boy presenting with refractory anemia and excess blasts (RAEB) who had transformed to ALL. The karyotype of the patient was 46 XY, 5q-. In 2007, Goel et al. [9] described a case of 9-yr-old boy with childhood MDS-refractory anemia that transformed into B-precursor ALL after cyclosporine chemotherapy. Cytogenetic analysis of the patient revealed a normal karyotype. In 2010, Gupta et al. [10] reported a 5-yr-old girl who presented with RAEB that evolved into B cell ALL 4 months later. Cytogenetic analysis of the patient was not performed. In contrast to most RCC cases, 2 subsequent cases exhibited erythroid hyperplasia and hypercellularity, similarly to our case [9,10]. Although most cases of RCC exhibit a normal karyotype irrespective of BM cellularity, the prospective multicenter study EWOG-MDS 98 determined that RCC patients with normal or increased BM cellularity exhibited cytogenetic abnormalities more frequently than in the patients with hypocellular RCC [23].",

Chromosomal abnormalities such as monosomy 7, trisomy 8, and trisomy 21 are common in the transformation of childhood MDS to acute leukemia [25]. In our case, these common abnormalities were not observed. MDS normal karyotype and deletions of chromosome 5q, 20q, and Y are considered favorable prognostic factors, while monosomy 7 and complex abnormalities are considered poor prognostic factors [26]. Particularly, in our case, there was a homozygous loss of 13q14.2, including most of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1). In 50% of de novo MDS cases, chromosomal aberrations and rearrangements involving the RB1 gene in 13q14 are observed [25]. Deletion or translocation involving chromosomal band 13q14, the locus of the RB1 gene, are observed in a variety of hematological malignancies, including AML, plasma cell myeloma, and CLL. Deletion of most of the RB1 gene may be associated with poor prognosis, as the patient died 3 months after the diagnosis of MDS.",

This is the first case report in Korea of transformation into ALL from childhood MDS. Our case shows that there can be similar cases of lymphoid transformation of MDS in the Korean population; it supports, again, the nature of MDS as a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell disorder. Notably, the patient had a very short progression period compared with the 3 previously reported cases, and multiple cytogenetic aberrations that could not be detected using conventional cytogenetic testing methods. Studies are needed to determine whether cytogenetic analysis methods provide improved means of identifying high-risk patients in childhood MDS. Table 1. Cases of childhood MDS transforming to ALL",
