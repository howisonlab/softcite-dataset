            "text": "We show that isolated capital cities are robustly associated with greater levels of corruption across US states, in line with the view that this isolation reduces accountability. We then provide direct evidence that the spatial distribution of population relative to the capital affects different accountability mechanisms: newspapers cover state politics more when readers are closer to the capital, voters who live far from the capital are less knowledgeable and interested in state politics, and they turn out less in state elections. We also find that isolated capitals are associated with more money in state-level campaigns, and worse public good provision. (JEL D72, D73, H41, H83, K42, R23) Corruption is widely seen as a major problem, in developing and developed countries alike, and much has been written on its determinants and correlates. This paper pursues the first systematic investigation of a hitherto underappreciated element in this story: the spatial distribution of the population in a given polity of interest, relative to the seat of political power. This spatial distribution might affect the incentives and opportunities for public officials to misuse their office for private gain. In particular, it may affect the degree of accountability, as has long been noted in the particular context of US state politics. For instance, Wilson's (1966) seminal contribution argued that state-level politics were particularly prone to corruption because state capitals are often far from the major metropolitan centers, and thus face a lower level of scrutiny by citizens and by the media: these isolated capitals have \"small-city newspapers, few (and weak)",

An alternative view would have individual weights decline linearly with distance, and to allow for this possibility we will consider AvgDistance, without the log transformation, as a robustness check. 4 We will also consider a couple of well-known (inverse) measures of isolation: the share of population living in the state capital (as of 2010), CapitalShare, and a dummy for whether the capital is the largest city in the state, CapitalLargest.

These refer to cases, typically prosecuted by US Attorneys all over the country, against public officials and others involved in public corruption, as surveyed and compiled by the Public Integrity Section (PIS) at the US Department of Justice in their \"Report to Congress.\" Federal authorities can claim jurisdiction, for instance, over corruption-related crime that \"affects interstate commerce,\" or in entities that receive more than $10,000 in federal funds-which yields them a lot of leeway in pursuing cases related to state and local governments. The resulting measure has the substantial advantage of being relatively objective, and focusing on federal convictions alleviates concerns over the differences in resources and political bias that might affect the variation across states. 5 Because the measure is very noisy in terms of its year-on-year fluctuations, we focus attention on the average number of convictions, for the period 1976-2002.

However, it adds much relevant information, both because state officials are only a fraction of those implicated in corruption at the level of state politics, and because one would expect that a culture of corruption arising at that level would spill over to other domains of government in the state. 6 Still, we consider as an alternative approach a measure restricted to state-level officials. These are not discriminated on a state-by-state basis in the PIS Report, but some of the information can be recovered from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRACfed) at Syracuse University, a database compiling information about the federal government. We have gathered yearly data for each individual state and (fiscal) year between 1986 and 2011, and averaged them over the entire available period. 7 We also normalize the measure, using the number of state government employees (as of 1980). For the sake of robustness, we will also look at different approaches to measuring corruption. First, we follow Saiz and Simonsohn (2013) in building a measure from an online search, using the Exalead tool, for the term \"corruption\" close to the name of each state (performed in 2009). 8 Lastly, we consider additionally (in the online Appendix) the measure of corruption perceptions in state politics introduced by Boylan and Long (2003), based on a set of questions posed to reporters covering State Houses, and the TRACFed-based measure of convictions of local officials. The former is less objective, but gives us another measure of statelevel corruption; the latter provides a measure of spillovers across different levels of government. 9",

First, we will look at the correlation patterns linking isolated capital cities and corruption; on the other hand, we will look at direct evidence on whether isolation relates to different accountability mechanisms. The third pillar is about addressing endogeneity concerns regarding those correlation patterns, related to the facts that the location of the capital city is an institutional decision and that it affects the spatial distribution of population. Both of these could be correlated with omitted variables that are also associated with corruption. For instance, corruption and the location of the capital city could be jointly determined-say, with relatively corrupt states choosing to isolate their capital cities. Alternatively, it could be the case that corruption affects the population flows that determine how isolated the capital city will ultimately be-say, by pushing economic activity and population away from the capital. We now turn to the empirical strategy we use to address these confounding factors.",

This is because concerns with equal representation led to strong pressures to locate the capital in a relatively central position, particularly as state capital cities were typically chosen at a time when transportation and communication costs were substantial (Zagarri 1987;Shelley 1996;Engstrom, Hammond, and Scott 2013). Consistent with that, a quick inspection of any map of the United States displaying all state capitals makes it immediately apparent that many of them are actually in relatively central locations.",

The coefficient of interest is highly significant, and fairly stable in size. Columns 3 and 4 add as controls other correlates of corruption that are established in the literature, and our preferred specification is that of column 3, which essentially reproduces the basic specification in Glaeser and Saks (2006). While in column 4 the size of the coefficient is slightly reduced, it is robustly statistically significant at the 1 percent level, quite remarkably in light of the small sample size. 18 The same pattern is also present for our first alternative measure of isolation, AvgLogDistanc e adj , as shown by columns 5-8 reproducing the four specifications. 19 The effect is also meaningful quantitatively. Our preferred specification's coefficient (1.03) implies that an increase of one standard deviation in the isolation of the capital city (around 0.09, or roughly the increase experienced by Carson City, NV between 1920 and 2000), would yield a corresponding increase in corruption (0.10) of around 0.75 standard deviation. 20 Let us now consider the robustness of our results, beyond the different specifications in Table 2. We first consider alternative measures of corruption, in Table 3. Columns 1 and 2 reproduce the main specification from our baseline results (columns 3 and 7 in Table 2), for the measure of corruption convictions restricted to state officials. 21 They very much confirm the message from Table 2. Even quantitatively, the results are fairly similar, and especially so when we take into account that this is a noisier measure: an exercise along the lines of what we have done for the baseline results would yield an effect of just over 0.55 standard deviation. 22 We then look at the alternative Exalead measure of corruption. 23 Columns 3 and 4 again mimic the main baseline specifications, and again find very similar results. The estimated quantitative effect is now of about 0.7 standard deviation, once again very close to the baseline. 24 The next step is to check for alternative measures of the isolation of the capital city. We find that the results are still present with both versions of AvgDistance, adjusted and unadjusted, as shown in columns 5 and 6. For the coarser measures, CapitalShare and CapitalLargest, we see negative coefficients in columns 7 and 8, 17 The online Appendix shows that the results are still present without the controls. 18 The results are not sensitive to outliers: they are still present when we run the regressions excluding one census region at a time. They also survive measures of party competition and of the breakdown of state revenues between taxes and other sources. These can all be seen in the online Appendix. 19 We do not include controls for geographical size, since this is built into the measure of concentration. The results are not sensitive to that choice (see the online Appendix).",

This is consistent with the idea that a culture of corruption at the state level spills over to other levels of government within the state. 23 Since the measure of corruption is computed over a more recent period, we use here the average of the measures of isolation up to 2000, and use the demographic control variables as of 2000 as well. 24 The regression results are also robust when we use the Boylan and Long (2003) measure of corruption perceptions in state politics. They are also quantitatively very similar to our baseline: the estimated coefficient implies that an increase in AvgLogDistanc e not by one standard deviation is associated with an increase in the measure of corruption perception of about 0.75 standard deviation. (See the online Appendix.) consistent with the baseline results. The quantitative implications, however, suggest in both cases a smaller effect, of about one-third of a standard deviation. This is consistent with a substantial measurement error being introduced by the use of these coarse measures. 25 We then probe the results with a few \"placebo\" regressions, meant to check whether the patterns we find in the data are actually related to the isolation of capital cities and its conjectured link with corruption and accountability. Columns 1-4 in Table 4 use the isolation of the largest city-since the latter is also the capital city in 17 out of 50 states, one might wonder whether the measure of isolation of the capital could be in fact proxying for that. It has no independent effect, and its inclusion does not affect the significance or size of the coefficient on the isolation of the capital.",

In particular, we will consider two possible versions of this hypothesis: the role of the media and the role of the electoral process. 29 Quite interestingly, the coefficients are remarkably consistent with those obtained in panel A, even if estimated a bit less precisely. This suggests that the potential bias stemming from our second source of endogeneity is not very important in practice. It is reassuring that the evidence for a causal impact of the isolation of the capital city on corruption seems robust to the different sources of endogeneity, and also in relation with the potential threat of the relative weakness of the land-suitability instrument.   The basic hypothesis we check is that a newspaper's coverage of state politics is greater when its readers are on average closer to the state capital. For this we first run regressions of our different measures of state-level political coverage on the concentration of readership around the capital, ReaderConcentr, controlling for newspaper size, circulation and state fixed effects. We indeed find coefficients that are generally positive and significant, as we can see in Table 6. 30 We can also look at this question at an aggregate state level, as opposed to that of individual newspapers. The regression evidence, in Table 7, confirms that states with isolated capitals tend to display lower levels of media coverage of state politics. 31 The effect is stronger for the AvgLogDistanc e adj measure, indicating that what matters most for the connection is how isolated the capital city is, not so much in terms of absolute distances, but rather relative to the geographical size of the state. 32 Similar results obtain with the measure of isolation of the state centroid in terms of population as an instrument for the isolation of the capital: we see a significant effect in the case of AvgLogDistanc e adj , and no effect for the case of AvgLogDistanc e not (columns 5 and 6).

This is very much in line with what we have termed the accountability view: the idea that isolated capitals may see corruption fester because of reduced accountability. We have also found direct evidence for that view, as different mechanisms are related to the spatial distribution of population. 38 First, we saw that newspapers whose audience is on average farther from the state capital provide less coverage of state politics. Such a pattern could be expected, to the extent that media outlets are at least partly trying to provide content that interests their audience (e.g., Mullainathan andShleifer 2005, Gentzkow andShapiro 2010), and to the extent that media consumers are at least somewhat more interested (ceteris paribus) in what happens close to where they live.
