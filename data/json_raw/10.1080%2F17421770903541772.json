            "text": "The year 2007 marks a sea change in spatial econometricians' way of thinking. Prior to this they were interested mainly in models containing one type of spatial interaction effect: the spatial lag model and the spatial error model. The first model contains a spatially lagged dependent variable, while the second model incorporates a spatial autoregressive process in the error term. The seminal book by Anselin (1988) and the testing procedure for a spatial error or a spatial lag model based on robust Lagrange multiplier tests developed by Anselin et al. (1996) may be considered as the main pillars behind this way of thinking. After 2007 the interest in models containing more than one spatial interaction effect increased. In his keynote speech at the first World Conference of the Spatial Econometrics Association in 2007, Harry Kelejian advocated models that include both a spatially lagged dependent variable and a spatially autocorrelated error term (based on Kelejian & Prucha, 1998 and related work), while James LeSage, in his presidential address at the 54th North American Meeting of the Regional Science Association International in 2007, advocated models that include both a spatially lagged dependent variable and spatially lagged explanatory variables. In analogy to Durbin (1960) for the time series case, Anselin (1988) labelled the latter model the spatial Durbin model.",

One strength of the spatial Durbin model is that it produces unbiased coefficient estimates also if the true data-generation process is a spatial lag or a spatial error model. Another strength is that it does not impose prior restrictions on the magnitude of potential spatial spillover effects. In contrast to other spatial regression specifications, these spillover effects can be global or local and be different for different explanatory variables. These and other important issues put forward in LeSage & Pace's book (hereinafter with page numbers shown in parentheses) will be summarized in this paper. This paper, however, is more than just a book review. In each of the following sections, I will first give my own view of the state of the art of one theme in applied spatial econometrics, and then I will discuss the contribution of LeSage & Pace's book.",

Since the linear regression model is commonly estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS), it is often labelled the OLS model. Furthermore, even though the OLS model in most studies focusing on spatial interaction effects is rejected in favour of a more general model, its results often serve as a benchmark. The opposite approach is to start with a more general model containing, nested within it as special cases, a series of simpler models that ideally should represent all the alternative economic hypotheses requiring consideration. Manski (1993) points out that three different types of interaction effects may explain why an observation associated with a specific location may be dependent on observations at other locations: (i) endogenous interaction effects, where the decision of a spatial unit (or its economic decision makers) to behave in some way depends on the decision taken by other spatial units; (ii) exogenous interaction effects, where the decision of a spatial unit to behave in some way depends on independent explanatory variables of the decision taken by other spatial units*if the number of independent explanatory variables in a linear regression model is K, then the number of exogenous interaction effects is also K, provided that the intercept is considered as a separate variable; and (iii) correlated effects, where similar unobserved environmental characteristics result in similar behaviour.",

W is an N )N matrix describing the spatial arrangement of the spatial units in the sample. Lee (2004) shows that W should be a non-negative matrix of known constants. The diagonal elements are set to zero by assumption, since no spatial unit can be viewed as its own neighbour. The matrices I \u00c1 rW and I \u00c1 lW should be non-singular, where I represents the identity matrix of order N. For a symmetric W, this condition is satisfied as long as r and l are in the interior of (1/v min , 1/v max ), where v min denotes the smallest (i.e. most negative) and v max the largest real characteristic root of W. If W is row normalized subsequently, the latter interval takes the form (1/v min , 1), since the largest characteristic root of W equals unity in this situation. If W is an asymmetric matrix before it is row normalized, it may have complex characteristic roots. LeSage & Pace (pp. 88\u00c189) demonstrate that in that case r and l are restricted to the interval (1/r min , 1), where r min equals the most negative purely real characteristic root of W after this matrix is row normalized. Finally, one of the following two conditions should be satisfied: (a) the row and column sums of the matrices W, (I \u00c1 rW) \u00c11 and (I \u00c1 lW) \u00c11 before W is row normalized should be uniformly bounded in absolute value as N goes to infinity, or (b) the row and column sums of W before W is row normalized should not diverge to infinity at a rate equal to or faster than the rate of the sample size N. Condition (a) originates from Kelejian & Prucha (1998, 1999, and condition (b) from Lee (2004). Both conditions limit the cross-sectional correlation to a manageable degree, i.e. the correlation between two spatial units should converge to zero as the distance separating them increases to infinity.",

Normally, no spatial unit is assumed to be a neighbour to more than a given number, say q, of other units. By contrast, when the spatial weights matrix is an inverse distance matrix, (a) may not be satisfied. Consider an infinite number of spatial units that are arranged linearly. The distance of each spatial unit to its first left-and right-hand neighbour is d; to its second left-and right-hand neighbour, the distance is 2d; and so on. When W is an inverse distance matrix and the offdiagonal elements of W are of the form 1/d ij , where d ij is the distance between two spatial units i and j, each row sum is 2)( 1 =d ' 1 =2d ' 1 =3d '. . .); representing a series that is not finite. This is perhaps the reason why some empirical applications introduce a cut-off point d + such that w ij 00 if d ij d + . However, since the ratio 2)( 1 =d ' 1 =2d ' 1 =3d '. . .)=N 00 as N goes to infinity, condition (b) is satisfied, which implies that an inverse distance matrix without a cut-off point does not necessarily have to be excluded in an empirical study for reasons of consistency.",

            "text": "The opposite situation occurs when all cross-sectional units are assumed to be neighbours of each other and are given equal weights. In that case all off-diagonal elements of the spatial weights matrix are w ij 01. Since the row and column sums are N \u00c1 1, these sums diverge to infinity as N goes to infinity. In contrast to the previous case, however, (N \u00c1 1)/N01 instead of 0 as N goes to infinity. This implies that a spatial weights matrix that has equal weights and that is row normalized subsequently, w ij 01/(N(1), must be excluded for reasons of consistency. Figure 1 summarizes a family of eight linear spatial econometric models, among which are the non-spatial model in (1) on the right-hand side and the Manski model in (2) on the left-hand side. Each model to the right of the Manski model can be obtained from that model by imposing restrictions on one or more of its parameters. The kinds of restrictions are reported alongside the arrows in Figure 1. Some of the models recorded in Figure 1 are well known and frequently used in applied research, while other models are not. LeSage & Pace (p. 32) denote the model with a spatially lagged dependent variable (WY) and a spatially autocorrelated error term (Wo) by the term SAC, though without pointing out what this acronym is standing for. Since Kelejian & Prucha (1998) have been the main advocates of this model, it is therefore renamed the Kelejian\u00c1Prucha model in this paper. The model with a spatially lagged dependent variable (WY) and spatially lagged independent variables (WX) has been introduced by Anselin (1988) and is labelled the spatial Durbin model. A model with spatially lagged independent variables (WX) and a spatially autocorrelated error term has hardly been used in the literature. LeSage & Pace (pp. 41\u00c142) label it the spatial Durbin error model. Figure 1 seems to indicate that the best strategy to test for spatial interaction effects is to start with the most general model, i.e. the model that includes a spatially lagged dependent variable, spatially lagged independent variables, and a spatially autocorrelated error term simultaneously. However, as Manski (1993) notes, at least one of the K'2 interaction effects must be excluded, because otherwise the parameters are unidentified. To verify this, I carried out a simple Monte Carlo experiment generating Y by (2a) and (2b), one X variable drawn from a uniform distribution on the interval [\u00c11,1], r 0 a 0 b 0 u 0 l 0 0:25; s 2 00.01, N060, and a spatial weights matrix W corresponding to the corners of the seams in a soccer ball (in Matlab known as the Bucky Ball). Based on 1,000 repetitions, I found biases in the parameter estimates of the endogenous and exogenous interaction effects (r and u, respectively) that may be as great as 0.0423 and, related to that, standard deviations that may be as great as 0.2677. These results corroborate Manski's (1993, p. 534) finding that there are no technical obstacles to estimating a model with interaction effects among the dependent variable, the independent variables and the disturbance terms, but that the parameter estimates cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way since the endogenous and exogenous effects cannot be distinguished from each other.",

In contrast, ignoring spatial dependence in the disturbances, if present, will only cause a loss of efficiency. Furthermore, the spatial Durbin model produces unbiased coefficient estimates also if the true data-generation process is any of the other spatial regression specifications recorded in Figure 1, except for the Manski model. By contrast, if the Kelejian\u00c1Prucha model is taken as the point of departure, it will suffer from omitted variables bias if the true data-generation process is a spatial Durbin or a spatial Durbin error model. Similarly, if the spatial Durbin error model is taken as the point of departure, it will suffer from omitted variables bias if the true data-generation process is a spatial lag, Kelejian\u00c1Prucha or spatial Durbin model.",

For this reason, it has become common practice to investigate whether the results are robust to the specification of W. A recent influential paper by Ertur & Koch (2007) is illustrative of this approach. By including spatial dependence structures in theoretical economic relationships explaining economic growth per capita, they end up with an empirical model that takes the form of a spatial Durbin model. However, since the theoretical model offers no guidance as to how to specify the spatial weights matrix, they consider two alternatives: one matrix whose non-diagonal elements are measured by 1/d 2 , where d reflects the distance between two units, and another matrix whose elements are measured by e \u00c12d . Since many other specifications have been considered in the spatial econometrics literature, among which are a binary contiguity matrix, an inverse distance matrix with or without a cut-off point, a q nearest-neighbour matrix (where q is a positive integer, such as 5 or 10), a question that recurs is how the selection procedure of the spatial weights matrix might be improved.",

The most widely used criterion is the log-likelihood function value. If a spatial interaction model is estimated based on S different spatial weights matrices and the log-likelihood function value of every model is estimated, one may select the spatial weights matrix exhibiting the highest log-likelihood function value. Harris & Kravtsova (2009) criticize this approach, because it would only find a local maximum among the competing models and not necessarily a correctly specified W (unless it is unknowingly included in the set of competing models considered). However, the Monte Carlo results found by Stakhovych & Bijmolt (2009) partly refute this critique. Although there is a serious probability of selecting the wrong spatial weights matrix if spatial dependence is weak, the consequences of this poor choice are limited because the coefficient estimates are quite close to the true ones. Conversely, although the wrong choice of a spatial weights matrix can distort the coefficient estimates severely, the probability that this really happens is small if spatial dependence is strong.",

            "text": "One of the merits of LeSage & Pace's book is that they offer another criterion to select models, namely the Bayesian posterior model probability. Whereas tests for significant differences between log-likelihood function values, such as the LRtest, can formally not be used if models are non-nested (i.e. based on different spatial weights matrices), Bayesian posterior model probabilities do not require nested models to carry out these comparisons (p. 162). The basic idea is to set prior probabilities equal to 1/S, making each model equally likely a priori, to estimate each model by Bayesian methods, and then to compute posterior probabilities based on the data and the estimation results of this set of S models. Although the mathematics of this approach might deter potential users (Chs 5 and 6), my experience with this approach is positive. First, posterior model probabilities may differ widely even if the estimation results appear to be quite robust to different specifications of the spatial weights matrix. In a study I did on cross-country differences in governance (Seldadyo et al., 2010), the posterior model probability of a 10 nearest-neighbour matrix appeared to be more than six times as large as that of an inverse distance matrix, more than three times as large as that of a five nearestneighbour matrix, and more than twice as large as an inverse distance matrix with a cut-off point. Second, since Matlab routines applying Bayesian methods to the spatial lag, spatial error and spatial Durbin models are made downloadable for free on LeSage's website (www.spatial-econometrics.com), these kinds of comparisons can be carried out relatively easily. Furthermore, since LeSage also provides Matlab routines applying the Bayesian method to the spatial lag, spatial error and spatial Durbin models of limited dependent variables, similar types of selection procedures as discussed in this and the previous sections can be used for empirical problems requiring a probit or tobit approach (Ch. 10).",

To improve the surveyability of the estimation results of spatial regression model specifications, LeSage & Pace therefore propose to report one direct effect measured by the average of the diagonal elements of the matrix on the right-hand side of (4), and one indirect effect measured by the average of either the row sums or the column sums of the non-diagonal elements of that matrix. The average row effect quantifies the impact on a particular element of the dependent variable as a result of a unit change in all elements of an exogenous variable, while the average column effect quantifies the impact of changing a particular element of an exogenous variable on the dependent variable of all other units. However, since the numerical magnitudes of these two calculations of the indirect effect are the same, it does not matter which one is used (pp. 33\u00c142).

It is these feedback effects that are responsible for the fact that the overall direct effect eventually increases. 10 One important limitation of the spatial lag model is that the ratio between the indirect and the direct effect of a particular explanatory variable is independent of b k . Table 1 illustrates that b k in the numerator and b k in the denominator of this ratio cancel each other out:",

In many empirical applications, this is not very likely. Finally, if the spatial Durbin model is adopted, both the direct effect and the indirect effect of a particular explanatory variable will also depend on the coefficient estimate u k of the spatially lagged value of that variable (see Table 1). The result is that no prior restrictions are imposed on the magnitude of both the direct and indirect effects and thus that the ratio between the indirect and the direct effect may be different for different explanatory variables. As a result of this property, the spatial Durbin is a more attractive point of departure in an empirical study than other spatial regression specifications.",

This is because the indirect effects are composed of different coefficient estimates according to complex mathematical formulae and the dispersion of these indirect effects depends on the dispersion of all coefficient estimates involved (see Table 1). For example, if the coefficients r, b k and u k in the spatial Durbin model happen to be significant, this does not automatically mean that the indirect effect of the kth explanatory variable is also significant.

A state-of-the-art application of spatial econometrics should also consider the spatial Durbin model, and interpret its direct and indirect effects, unless statistical tests show that simpler models suffice. There are two major reasons why the spatial Durbin model cannot be ignored. First, it is the only means of producing unbiased coefficient estimates, even if the true data-generation process is a spatial lag, spatial error, Kelejian\u00c1Prucha or spatial Durbin error model.

Notes 1. The superscript T denotes the transpose of a vector or matrix. 2. Lee (2007) has found that a Manski type of model is not beyond the bounds of possibility, provided that one is willing to accept that the interaction effects among the error terms have a different spatial weights matrix than the interaction effects among the dependent variable and among the independent variables. Lee considers G groups, each consisting of N g cross-sectional units, and assumes that the elements of the spatial weights matrix measuring the endogenous and exogenous interaction effects are w ij 01/(N g \u00c1 1) if units i and j belong to the same group (except if i0j ), and zero otherwise. To account for correlated errors among the members of each group, Lee considers group fixed effects. Mathematically, these group fixed effects can be represented by a spatial weights matrix whose elements are all equal to w ij 01/N g if units i and j belong to the same group, including the diagonal elements (i.e. if i0j ), and zero otherwise. Starting with these spatial weights matrices, Lee proves that the parameters are identified either if both N and N g tend to infinity, with at least two units in each group, or if the number of units in each group does not tend to infinity faster than or equal to the number of groups.",

Based partly on Elhorst & Fr\u00e9ret (2009) and Seldadyo et al. (2010). 6. The latter tests are called robust because the existence of one type of spatial dependence does not bias the test for the other type of spatial dependence. 7. If the (robust) LM tests reject these extensions of the OLS model, it is still useful to estimate the spatial lag and the spatial error model. In case the spatial autoregressive coefficient r and/or the spatial autocorrelation coefficient l turns out to be significant, we may again conclude that the OLS model must be rejected in favour of the spatial lag, the spatial error model or in favour of both models, and continue estimating the spatial Durbin model. 8. In order to obtain an asymmetric spatial weights matrix W, unit 1 is not assumed to be a neighbour of unit 3. If these units were also assumed to be neighbours, we would have a symmetric matrix which is not general enough. 9. I abstract here from the problem that a cross-sectional model with an intercept, WY, X and WX variables cannot be estimated on the basis of N03 observations. 10. This also holds if the spatial autoregressive parameter is negative. The first term that produces feedback effects is r 2 W 2 . This term will always be positive. The second term is r 3 W 3 . Since r is restricted to the interval (1/r min , 1) and the non-negative elements of W after row normalization are smaller than or equal to 1, the diagonal elements of r 3 W 3 are smaller in absolute value than those of r 2 W 2 . Since the series r 2 W 2 ' r 3 W 3 'r 4 W 4 ' . . . alternates in sign if r is negative, the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix represented by this series will always be positive. 11. For example, the indirect effect of the kth variable in the spatial Durbin model of draw d that is used for illustration purposes in Table 1 would be equal to",
