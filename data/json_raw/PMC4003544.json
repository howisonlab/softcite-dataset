            "text": "King cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) venom L-amino acid oxidase (OH-LAAO), a heat stable enzyme, has been shown to exhibit very potent anti-proliferative activity against human breast and lung tumorigenic cells but not in their non-tumorigenic counterparts. We further examine its in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in a human prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3) model. OH-LAAO demonstrated potent cytotoxicity against PC-3 cells with IC 50 of 0.05 \u00b5g/mL after 72 h incubation in vitro. It induced apoptosis as evidenced with an increase in caspase-3/7 cleavages and an increase in annexin V-stained cells. To examine its in vivo anti-tumor activity, we treated PC-3 tumor xenograft implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient NU/NU (nude) mice with 1 \u00b5g/g OH-LAAO given intraperitoneally (i.p.). After 8 weeks of treatment, OH-LAAO treated PC-3 tumors were markedly inhibited, when compared to the control group (P <0.05). TUNEL staining analysis on the tumor sections showed a significantly increase of apoptotic cells in the LAAO-treated animals. Histological examinations of the vital organs in these two groups showed no significant differences with normal tissues, indicating no obvious tissue damage. The treatment also did not cause any significant changes on the body weight of the mice during the duration of the study. These observations suggest that OH-LAAO cytotoxic effects may be specific to tumor xenografts and less to normal organs. Given its potent anti-tumor activities shown in vitro as well as in vivo, the king cobra venom LAAO can potentially be developed to treat prostate cancer and other solid tumors.",

            "text": "Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths after lung cancer worldwide [1]. Similar to other cancers, prostate cancer arise from prostate epithelial cells which display uncontrollable growth (beyond the normal limits), invasion, and metastasis capabilities [2]. Current chemotherapy regimen for prostate cancer usually involves the use of substances toxic to normal cells and hence the treatment is usually accompanied by a range of side effects such as vomiting, nausea and alopecia. Thus, there is continual need to search for potential natural-based cancer therapeutic agents that exhibit highly selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells over the normal cells.",

It catalyzes oxidative deamination of L-amino acid to produce the corresponding \u03b1-keto acid, hydrogen peroxide and ammonia [5,6]. The biological activities are primarily caused by the hydrogen peroxide produced during the oxidative deamination and the cytotoxic action was believed to exert via apoptosis [3]. Unlike other venom LAAOs, king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) venom LAAO, with a molecular weight of 130 kDa, has an unusual thermal stability. At pH 7.4, the enzyme retained 100% activity after incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 5 days. Unlike other snake venom LAAO, king cobra venom LAAO was stable at alkaline condition and was not inactivated by freezing [7]. Because of these favourable stability properties, king cobra venom LAAO has a greater potential, when compared to other venom LAAOs, to be developed as a cancer therapeutic agent. Earlier studies also showed that the king cobra venom enzyme exhibited extremely potent anti-proliferative activities in comparison with other venom LAAOs, and that its cytotoxicity was selective against tumorigenic cells [3].",

LAAO-treated cells also demonstrated a 3.8-fold increase in caspase-3/7 activity, when compared with vehicle-treated cells (Figure 2A). Low levels of caspase-3/7 activity was also detected in the control cells, which was presumably due to the small amount of apoptotic cells present in the growing cell population. PE-annexin V/7-AAD analysis also showed greater number of apoptotic cells by OH-LAAO treatment (29.5%) compared to vehicle group (4.8%) ( Figure 2B).

The 8-week OH-LAAO treatment at this dose indeed did not cause any significant differences in the body weight between the treated and control mice, nor any significant pathological abnormalities in the major organs of the treated animals. These observations, together with the high IC50 of OH-LAAO determined in non-tumorigenic breast and lung cells as reported earlier [3], strongly suggest that this enzyme is relatively non-toxic to normal tissues. The selective cytotoxicity of OH-LAAO could be due to the differences in the metabolism of the cells (tumor cells versus non-tumorigenic cells) or the selective binding of the enzyme to tumorigenic cells. Wei et al. [21] reported that at dosage up to 50 \u00b5g Bungarus faciastus LAAO did not induce significant organ damage including lung, heart, kidneys, liver and spleen. Bregge-Silva et al. [22] reported that 100 \u00b5g of Lachesis muta LAAO did not cause morphological changes in the heart, lung and kidney tissues. However, Wei et al. [23] reported that 50 \u00b5g of Agkistrodon blomhoffii ussurensis LAAO caused severe lung lesions after 6 and 24 h injections, indicating that LAAOs from different venoms may differ in their toxicity.   The detailed mechanism of cytotoxic action of snake venom LAAO on cancer cells has not been established. A possibility is that the injected OH-LAAO acts by binding to the tumor cell surface and generates a highly localized (and hence concentrated) H 2 O 2. The H 2 O 2 may have direct cytotoxic action or may act via the oxidative modifications of signalling proteins. The dose of OH-LAAO chosen in the in vivo anti-tumor studies (1 \u00b5g/g body weight) was estimated to give a theoretical level of LAAO of about 5 \u00b5g/mL in the extracellular fluid (ECF) of the mice, assuming that ECF was 20% of body weight [24], if all the injected LAAO were absorbed and distributed throughout the entire ECF compartment instantaneously. This level would far exceed the IC50 dose of PC-3 cells in vitro. However, it should be noted that absorption of LAAO injected is not likely to be instantaneous, and not all injected LAAO would be absorbed. Further, a certain quantity of LAAO may be degraded or excreted before it reaches the target cells. Also, the rate and ability of the LAAO to permeate the capillary wall and penetrate to the tumor cells are likely to be limited. Thus, the exact level of LAAO that the tumor cells in the treated mice are exposed to is likely to be much lower than 5 \u00b5g/mL. Nevertheless, at this dose of treatment (1 \u00b5g/g body weight) the LAAO in the animals was shown to be able to inhibit growth of the tumor effectively, with no visible deleterious effect on the major organs or reducing the body weight of the animals.",

In our studies, we demonstrated that despite the large molecular size, king cobra venom LAAO could effectively inhibit solid tumor growth in vivo. Compared to the control, treatment with OH-LAAO caused 39% reduction on PC-3 tumor size in the mice (P <0.01) after just one week of treatment. While substantial individual variation in anti-tumor effect was observed in the LAAO-treated mice during the 8-week treatment. Our data demonstrate that king cobra venom LAAO could indeed effectively inhibit tumor growth in vivo. The ability of king cobra venom LAAO to effectively inhibit the tumor growth is presumably due to its very high cytotoxicity towards PC-3 cells (IC50 = 0.05 \u00b5g/mL, 72 h incubation). Earlier, Zhang and Wu [8] reported that 10 days treatment with 1.5 \u00b5g/g of Agkistrodon acutus venom LAAO inhibited tumor growth of Hepatoma 22, Sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma tumors (established in Kun Ming mice) by 21.6%, 12.9% and 14.2%, respectively. However, it is not known whether the mice used were immunocompromised and hence the validity of results difficult to assess. In this study, we used immunocompromised mice, and the king cobra venom LAAO yielded greater level of growth inhibition, including one complete regression after 8 weeks of treatment.",

However, its high molecular weight may hinder its penetration into the tumor; therefore further development in delivery system may be required. For example, magnetic nanoparticle-enzyme system may allow the use of lower amount of LAAO to target specifically the tumor area, while maintaining maximal cytotoxicity. This approach has been used in the application D-amino acid oxidase for cancer treatment [26]. In addition, the enzyme is probably more effective against cancer cell suspensions such as leukemias and ascites, than in solid tumors. Alternatively, the enzyme could be cloned and transfected to tumor cells to induce cell death in situ, an approach suggested by Sun et al. [17].",

The fold change of the control is considered as 1 and the error bars indicate standard deviations. * P < 0.05 in the LAAO-treated versus control cells. B) PE-Annexin V/7-AAD analysis of the effect of OH-LAAO treatment on the PC-3 cells. The cells were treated with 0.05 \u00b5g/mL of OH-LAAO for 72 h and were then stained with Annexin V conjugated to Phycoerythrin (PE) and 7-Amino-Actinomycin D (7-AAD) prior to the FACS analysis. Cells(10,000 events) were analyzed by fluorescent-activated cell scanner. The lower left quadrant contains the viable (Annexin V negative; 7-AAD negative) population, the upper left quadrant contains the damage (Annexin V negative; 7-AAD positive) population, the upper right quadrant contains the late apoptotic (Annexin V positive; 7-AAD positive) cells and the lower right quadrant contains the early apoptotic (Annexin V positive; 7-AAD negative) cells. Left: PC-3 cells control; Right: OH-LAAO treated PC-3 cells. Total apoptotic cells (%) are shown in each figure. Figures are representatives of duplicate analysis from 2-independent experiments.",
