            "text": "Microglia are the resident immune cells in the central nervous system and key players against pathogens and injury. However, persistent microglial activation often exacerbates pathological damage and has been implicated in many neurological diseases. Despite their pivotal physiological and pathophysiological roles, how the survival and death of activated microglia is regulated remains poorly understood. We report here that microglia activated through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) undergo RIP1/RIP3dependent programmed necrosis (necroptosis) when exposed to the pan caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. Although zVAD-fmk and the caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-fmk had no effect on unstimulated primary microglia, they markedly sensitized microglia to TLR1/ 2,3,4,7/8 ligands or TNF treatment, triggering programmed necrosis that was completely blocked by R1P1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1. Interestingly, necroptosis induced by TLR ligands and zVAD was restricted to microglial cells and was not observed in astrocytes, neurons or oligodendrocytes even though they are known to express certain TLRs. Deletion of genes encoding TNF or TNFR1 failed to prevent lipopolysaccharide-and poly(I:C)-induced microglial necroptosis, unveiling a TNFindependent programmed necrosis pathway in TLR3-and TLR4-activated microglia. Microglia from mice lacking functional TRIF were fully protected against TLR3/4 activation and zVAD-fmk-induced necrosis, and genetic deletion of rip3 also prevented microglia necroptosis. Activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase and generation of specific reactive oxygen species were downstream signaling events required for microglial cell death execution. Taken together, this study reveals a robust RIP3-dependent necroptosis signaling pathway in TLR-activated microglia upon caspase blockade and suggests that TLR signaling and programmed cell death pathways are closely linked in microglia, which could contribute to neuropathology and neuroinflammation when dysregulated.",

            "text": "Microglia are the resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and the primary defenders that protect the CNS against pathogens and injury. However, persistent and excessive activation of microglia may result in pathological inflammation and has been shown to actively participate in many neurological disorders including acute brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases. 1,2 Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major family of pattern recognition receptors that recognize highly conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed on broad microorganisms and initiate innate immune responses. 3 In addition, TLRs also detect endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns, hence having key roles in infectious as well as non-infectious CNS disorders. 4 Microglia express a repertoire of TLRs, 5 and their engagement has been linked to neuronal 6 and oligodendroglial damage, 7,8 and exacerbated brain injury. 9 As TLR-activated microglia secrete proinflammatory cytotoxic mediators, the resolution of activated microglia must be tightly regulated. It has long been recognized that the number and activity of activated microglia in the CNS decreases as the pathogen is cleared or the insult subsides. However, the mechanisms that govern the elimination of locally activated microglia remain elusive. Activation-induced apoptosis of microglia is one mechanism that downregulates activated microglia. Nitric oxide, caspase-11, -1 and -3, and MST-1 have all been shown to mediate apoptosis of microglia activated by interferon gamma (IFNg) or IFNg plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). [10][11][12] Although it is evident that activated microglia can undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis, it remains to be determined whether activated microglia can adapt other cell death pathways. Dysregulation of the self-elimination process could potentially exacerbate CNS diseases, and persistently activated microglia are in fact associated with many chronic neuropathological conditions.",

            "text": "Necrotic cell death is traditionally viewed as a passive process caused by overwhelming stress and as a cause for inflammation due to release of intracellular materials. Accumulating evidence has now clearly demonstrated that certain type of necrotic cell death is programmed and could be prevented. Activation of the kinase domain of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and assembly of RIP1/RIP3containing signaling complex have been shown to trigger programmed necrosis in some cells, a process also termed necroptosis. 13 Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), a small tryptophanbased molecule that allosterically inhibits RIP1 kinase activity, 14,15 prevents death receptor-induced necrosis 16 and blocks oxidative oligodendroglial cell death. 17 Administration of necrostatin-1 ameliorates neural injury in animal models of ischemia, 15,18 traumatic brain injury, 19 and Huntington's disease. 20 Although the underlying mechanism of the in vivo protective effect of necrostatin-1 remains to be fully established, necrostatin-1 administration in mice subjected to controlled cortical impact was associated with reduced microglial activation. 19 Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that caspase-8, the initiator caspase of the death receptor-induced pathway of apoptosis, and its adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) negatively regulate RIP1/RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis by cleaving and inactivating RIP1. 21 Suppression of caspase-8 activity with the pan caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk facilitates TNFa-induced necroptosis in cells expressing RIP3. 22 Unlike TNF death receptor-induced necrosis, the details of pathogen-induced necrosis in innate immune cells have just started to emerge. Several studies have shown that when caspase-8 activity is suppressed by IETD-fmk, zVAD-fmk, or the viral caspase inhibitor CrmA, ligation of TLR3 or TLR4 results in programmed necrosis in human macrophages 23 and mouse peritoneal macrophages via RIP3. 22,24 However, whether activated microglia, the innate immune cells in the CNS, undergo programmed necrosis remains unanswered.",

Although activation of microglia with very low dose of LPS (0.1 ng/ml) promoted cell survival (Figures 1a and b) and TNF production ( Figure 1d), higher concentrations of LPS (10-100 ng/ml) caused microglial cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 1a-c). Production of TNF by activated microglia was dependent on the extent of microglia activation and appeared to reach the peak with 10 ng/ml LPS (Figure 1d), a concentration that also induced significant DNA fragmentation as determined by increased number of TUNEL \u00fe cells (Figure 1c).

Activation of the executioner caspase-3 was evident in microglia treated with higher but not low dose of LPS ( Figure 1e) and preceded apoptotic cell death (Supplementary Figure S1). As caspase-8 is an initiator caspase required for extrinsic pathways of apoptosis, we examined caspase-8 activation in live microglia after LPS stimulation with fluorescein-tagged FAM-LETD-fmk that affinity-labels activated caspase-8. 26 Two distinct patterns of caspase-8 activation were observed ( Figure 1e): diffuse cytosolic activation (C-Casp-8) and localized subcellular activation of caspase-8 (L-Casp-8). Although L-Casp-8 \u00fe microglia were negative for TUNEL or activated caspase-3, many C-Casp-8 \u00fe microglia were also positive for TUNEL and activated caspase-3, suggesting that diffuse caspase-8 activation in cytosol leads to apoptosis (Figures 1e and f). Localized caspase-8 activation was previously also found in T lymphocytes upon antigen receptor activation and was associated with cell proliferation. 26 Together, these findings suggest that focally activated caspase-8 may function as a signaling molecule in complexes, while higher degree of activation in the cytoplasm initiates apoptotic cell death programme.",

To examine the possible function of localized caspase-8 activation in LPS-activated microglia, we activated primary rat microglia with 0.1 ng/ml of LPS in the presence of specific caspase inhibitors. Although the pan caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (zVAD) had no effect on unstimulated, 'resting' microglia, it triggered rapid and massive cell death in LPS-activated microglia (Figures 2a-c). Furthermore, zVAD was similarly effective in inducing microglial cell death when added to microglia that were pre-activated with LPS and washed extensively (Supplementary Figure S2). LPS-activated microglia were also sensitive to caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-fmk (IETD) (Figures 2a and b). In contrast, caspase-3/7 inhibitor DEVD-fmk, caspase-1 inhibitor YVAD-fmk or their combination did not cause any cell death (Figures 2a and b). Microglia underwent necrotic cell death when treated with LPS/zVAD, as evidenced by increased DNA fragmentation (Figures 2d and e) and loss of plasma membrane integrity (Figures 2b-c). As in situ detection of fragmented DNA by TUNEL does not necessarily distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis, we then employed electron microscopic analyses. Consistent with our finding that higher magnitude of LPS/TLR4 activation induces caspase-dependent apoptosis (Figure 1e, Supplementary Figure S1), microglia activated with higher dose of LPS alone exhibited morphological characteristics of typical apoptosis, including decreased cellular volume, condensation of chromatin and intact cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 2f, middle). In contrast, zVAD greatly sensitized microglia to low level of LPS activation, leading to necrosis that was characterized by translucent cytoplasm, organelle swelling, increased cell volume and disruption of the plasma membrane ( Figure 2f). It should be mentioned that, in contrast to LPS-activated primary microglia where caspase-8 inhibitors triggered necrosis without suppressing TNF (Supplementary Figure S3), LPS/zVAD failed to cause cell death in BV-2 microglial cell line and only moderately suppressed TNF secretion (Supplementary Figure S4). 27 Taken together, our results demonstrate that LPS-activated primary microglia possess at least two distinct cell death pathways depending on the extent of their activation and the presence of caspase suppressors.",

Indeed, all other TLR ligands tested induced microglial necrosis ( Figure 3a). In contrast, activation of microglia with ATP (up to 1 mM) or IL-13 (100 ng/ml) plus zVAD did not cause cell death (Supplementary Figure S5), suggesting microglial necrosis specificity to death receptor and TLR activation.

First, we confirmed that LPS/zVAD-induced necrosis was indeed mediated through the LPS receptor TLR4, as LPS-but not poly(I:C)-induced necroptosis was completely abrogated in tlr4-mutant microglia (Figure 5a). Next, we prepared mixed glial cultures from tnf \u00fe / \u00fe and tnf \u00c0 / \u00c0 mouse brains, and examined microglial survival after overnight stimulation with LPS/zVAD. Although tnf \u00c0 / \u00c0 microglia were incapable of producing TNF, 36 they were equally susceptible as wild type to LPS/zVAD-induced cell death (Figure 5b), suggesting that autocrine production of TNF was not necessary for LPS/ zVAD-induced necrosis. In line with this, LPS/zVAD-induced loss of microglia was also independent of the TNF receptor TNFR1 (Figure 5b). Similarly, poly(I:C)/zVAD caused significant level of toxicity in both wild-type and tnf-deficient microglia (Supplementary Figure S6). Together, these results demonstrate the existence of alternative necrosis-initiating pathways other than the TNF/TNFR1 pathway in TLR4-and TLR3-activated microglia.",

As TRIF is a common adaptor molecule for both TLR3 and TLR4 signaling, the role of TRIF in microglial necroptosis was examined. Whereas LPS/zVAD and poly(I:C)/zVAD induced significant loss of wild-type microglia, trif-mutant microglia were completely protected, demonstrating a critical role for TRIF in TLR3/TLR4-activated microglial cell death (Figure 5c). To verify that TRIF indeed specifically mediated the signaling events following TLR3 ligation, TNF secretion in culture supernatants was analyzed. As expected, poly(I:C)-induced TNF production was abolished in trif-mutant microglia whereas LPS-induced TNF production was only transiently blocked ( Figure 5d). This is consistent with the concept that TLR4 recruits adaptor molecules MyD88 and TRIF, whereas TRIF is the sole adaptor molecule for TLR3. 3 One potential mechanistic link between TLR3/TLR4 activation and necroptosis is that TRIF physically interacts with RIP1 and RIP3 via receptor-interacting protein homotypic interaction motif (RHIM). 24,37 In support of this idea, rip3 deficiency completely prevented microglia from LPS/zVAD-as well as poly(I:C)/zVAD-induced necrosis (Figure 5e), and had no effect on LPS-induced TNF production (not shown). Interestingly, rip3 \u00fe / \u00c0 heterozygous microglia exhibited about 50% of the sensitivity toward LPS/zVAD or poly(I:C)/zVAD as compared with rip3 \u00fe / \u00fe microglia (Figure 5e). Therefore, in addition to RIP3 activation being a key regulatory point for necroptosis, our data also indicate that the protein expression level of RIP3 is important for effective induction of necroptosis.",

Unlike previous studies, we did not detect significant fluorescence signal in LPS/zVAD-treated microglia using H 2 DCF-DA, a widely used general cellular oxidative stress/ROS indicator, 40 likely due to the low activation state of microglia. However, a significant increase of fluorescence signal from superoxide indicator hydroethidine (HE) 41 was detected in microglia treated with LPS/zVAD for 3 h as compared with those treated with LPS alone (Figure 7a). Consistent with their effects on survival, Figure 7 Elevated production of superoxide anion orchestrates microglial demise and proceeds plasma membrane permeabilization. (a) Increased superoxide anion production by LPS/zVAD-activated microglia and complete suppression by Nec-1 and BHA. Microglia were pre-treated with Nec-1 (20 mM), BHA (150 mM), vitamin E (10 mM), vitamin K2 (10 mM), or SP600125 (10 mM) for 1 h prior to stimulation with low concentration of LPS (0.1 ng/ml) or LPS (0.1 ng/ml)/zVAD ( Nec-1 and BHA efficiently abrogated LPS/zVAD-induced HE signal whereas vitamin E and K2 did not (Figure 7a). The JNK inhibitor SP600125, although significantly and partially suppressed LPS/zVAD-induced cell death, had only limited effect on LPS/zVAD-induced increased of HE signal, suggesting that JNK activation is at the level or downstream of ROS production. This is in agreement with the observation that BHA prevented ROS production, and significantly and partially blocked LPS/zVAD-induced JNK activation (Figure 6b). Further fluorescence microscopy analyses at single cell levels revealed that LPS/zVAD-triggered superoxide production proceeded plasma membrane permeabilization and cell death (Figures 7b-e). Together, these results support the idea that excess superoxide or related species is a main source of ROS in LPS/zVAD-treated microglia. In summary, our data demonstrate that TLR4-induced microglial necroptosis is orchestrated by a series of events mediated by TRIF, RIP1/RIP3 signaling, JNK activation and specific ROS production.",

            "text": "Programmed cell death is a fundamental cellular process with critical functions in development, homeostasis, and immunity. Caspase-dependent apoptosis and the recently identified programmed necrosis, also termed necroptosis, are two programmed cell death pathways that have been shown to have pivotal roles in the peripheral immune system, such as elimination of reactive T cells and innate control of viral infections. [42][43][44] Microglia are the immune cells in the CNS and regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses; however, to date, to our knowledge little information is available on a necroptosis programme in microglia. In this study, we demonstrated an operation of two interconnected programmed cell death pathways in TLR-activated primary microglia: (1) caspase-dependent apoptosis in overactivated microglia, and (2) RIP3-mediated necroptosis as unmasked by caspase blockade. TLR-receptor agonists as well as TNF were capable of initiating primary microglia necrosis when caspase-8 was suppressed by zVAD-fmk or IETD-fmk, phenomena not observed in other cells of the CNS including primary neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. The specific RIP1 kinase inhibitor, necrostatin-1, was highly effective in rescuing microglia against necroptosis. We further found that necrosis induced by ligation of microglial TLR4 or TLR3 with LPS and poly(I:C), respectively, and zVAD was independent of autocrine TNF/TNFR1 signaling and was transduced through the adaptor molecule TRIF, as LPS/zVAD and poly(I:C)/zVAD failed to cause microglial necroptosis in trif-mutant cells. TRIF, RIP1 and RIP3 are known RHIM motif-containing adaptor proteins capable of interacting with each other via RHIM, 37,45 and activation of TLR3 and TLR4 in the presence of zVAD induces the formation of TRIF/RIP3 complex. 24 Consistent with this, genetic ablation of rip3 completely abrogated necroptosis in microglia, demonstrating an absolute requirement for RIP3 signaling in initiating necrotic death of activated microglia. Finally, activation of JNK and generation of specific ROS appear to execute the cell death program and result in disintegration of activated microglia.",

            "text": "Microglia act as a first line of defense in the CNS and can be activated through TLRs in diverse situations, not only by microbial PAMPs but also by host-derived molecules liberated from damaged cells. However, the regulation of the homeostasis of activated microglia remains poorly understood. Excessive activation of microglia with LPS was associated with increased apoptotic cell death. Intriguingly, although low dose of LPS activated microglia without inducing cell death, blockade of caspase-8 triggered a robust RIP1-dependent necrosis programme. One possibility is that caspase-8 inactivates RIP1 through proteolytic cleavage, 21 and its suppression enhances RIP1 stability, thereby sensitizing cells to RIP1-mediated necrosis. In fact, caspase-8 has been shown to possess prosurvival activities as it is required for T-lymphocyte activation, 46,47 monocyte differentiation 48,49 as well as suppression of TNF-induced necroptosis. 13,21 Caspase-8 and -3/7 recently have also been implicated in microglial activation, as their blockade with IETD-fmk and DEVD-fmk suppressed LPS-induced upregulation of iNOS and certain cytokines in BV-2 microglia without triggering cell death. 27 We also found that caspase inhibitors did not cause BV-2 cell death and only moderately suppressed LPSinduced TNF production. In contrast, caspase blockade did not prevent LPS-induced TNF secretion in primary rat microglia, but rather markedly sensitized the cells to LPS challenge. It is noteworthy that primary rat microglia are more vulnerable than mouse microglia to TLR3/4 stimulation and caspase blockade. As caspase-8 can interact and form signaling complexes with, for example, cFLIP, FADD, RIP1/3, and TRIF under different contexts, 50 further investigation is required to delineate the exact function of caspase-8 in regulating microglial activation, survival and cell death using genetic approaches. Another interesting finding of this study is that overnight stimulation of microglia with LPS results in enhanced RIP1/RIP3 expression that predisposes the cells to necroptosis induction. The mechanism underlying LPSinduced upregulation of RIP3 remains to be defined.",

Other lipophilic antioxidants, such as a-tocopherol, antioxidant enzyme mimics and lipoxygenase inhibitors, although effective in preventing arachidonic acid-induced necroptosis in oligodendrocytes, 17 did not efficiently block TLR-mediated microglial necrosis. Zhang et al. 22 also noted that only BHA prevented TNF-induced necrosis in N cells. In line with our findings, elevated levels of superoxide production in LPS/zVADtreated microglia were found to precede cell death and was completely abolished by Nec-1 and BHA. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that BHA may have effects other than preventing superoxide production, overall our data strongly suggest that specific ROS at specific subcellular locations is required for TLR-activation-induced necroptosis in microglia.",

On the other hand, it is conceivable that necroptosis is a backup strategy of innate immune cells against pathogens to stimulate the immune system when apoptosis is blocked by, for example, viruses. 13,34 Pathological microglial cell death or degeneration has indeed been observed in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 53 multiple sclerosis 54 and neurodegenerative diseases. 55 However, the trigger and consequences of microglial cell death remain largely unexplored and warrant further investigation.",

Indeed, during the review process of our manuscript, a recent study reported that zVAD induces necrosis of LPS-activated microglia in mixed neuronal/glial cultures, thereby protecting neurons indirectly from LPS toxicity. 56 As microglia have critical physiological and pathological roles in many neurological disorders, detailed understanding of the mechanism that regulates the survival and death of activated microglia may provide novel strategies for targeting neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.",

Primary microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and mixed glial cultures were prepared from forebrains of 1-to 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups as described previously. 8,36 Briefly, dissociated cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine (PDL)-coated T75 flasks or 96 well culture plates and were fed every other day with D10S (DMEM with 10% FBS) for 7-10 days. Microglia were isolated by shaking mixed glia-containing flasks for 1 h at 200 r.p.m. The purity of microglia at this stage was consistently 495%. For highly purified microglia monocultures (499%), the cells were plated onto regular petri dishes for 1 h, detached from the plates with ice cold EBSS, and plated at final density of 3 \u00c2 10 4 cells per well in 96-well plates. Following 1-h pre-shaking, the flasks were shaken overnight at 200 r.p.m. to separate OL precursors (preOLs) from the astrocyte layer. The cell suspension was then plated onto uncoated Petri dishes for 1 h to remove residual contaminating microglia, and the resulting preOLs were plated into poly-L-ornithine-coated culture plates and maintained in a serum-free basal defined medium (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mg/ml human apo-transferrin, 50 mg/ml insulin, 30 nM sodium selenite, 10 nM D-biotin and 10 nM hydrocortisone in DMEM) supplemented with PDGF 10 ng/ml and bFGF 10 ng/ml for 5-9 days at 37 1C in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Astrocytes (495%) were purified from the remaining astrocyte layer in the flask after being exposed to a specific microglia toxin L-leucine methyl ester (1 mM) for 1 h and were subcultured one to two times. Mouse mixed glial cultures were prepared with similar methods as described above from B6.129SF2/J, C57BL/6J, TRIF mutant, TNF KO, TNFR1 KO, and rip3 KO mice and were seeded in PDL-coated 96-well plates.

For mixed glial cultures, cells were treated in serum-free basal defined medium. 30 As microglia in mixed glial cultures were not as sensitive as in isolated pure cultures to LPS/zVAD-induced necroptosis, higher concentrations of LPS and poly(I:C) were used. Microglial survival was determined by counting Iba1 \u00fe cells with normal nuclei in mixed glia cultures or Calcein AM \u00fe /propidium iodide (PI) \u00c0 cells in pure microglia cultures. Total number of cells was revealed by staining all nuclei with Hoechst 33342. Five to ten random consecutive fields were counted in each well under 100 \u00c2 or 200 \u00c2 magnification, with a total of 41000 cells counted in the control condition. In some cases, cell viability in monocultures was determined by measuring cell metabolic activity using Alamar Blue, a tetrazolium dye that is reduced by living cells to a colored product as previously described. 38,57 For experiments involving RNA and protein isolation, primary microglia were seeded into six-well plates at a density of 1.5-2 \u00c2 10 6 cells/well in D10S.

Transcriptional expression levels of RIP1, RIP3, Iba1, TNFa, and b-actin in microglia upon stimulation with LPS and zVADfmk were examined as described previously. 57 Using Tri reagent, total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual DNA was digested by incubating RNA samples with DNase I for 15 min at room temperature followed by DNase inactivation at 65 1C for 10 min according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The samples were reverse transcribed to cDNA using the reverse transcription system kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as described previously. 57 Primers specific for b-actin were used as a loading control. All products were amplified by PCR using 50 ng of cDNA and the following specific primers: RIP1, forward 5 0 -GCACCAGCTGTCAGGGCCAG-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -GCCCAGCTTTCGGGCACAGT-3 0 ; RIP3, forward 5 0 -ACCTTGGCTGGCACTC CCCA-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -CCCCTGCCGAACTGTGCTGG-3 0 ; TNFa, forward 5 0 -GCC CACGTCGTAGCAAAC-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -GCAGCCTTGTCCCTTGAA-3 0 ; Iba1, forward 5 0 -CTTTTGGACTGCTGAAAGCC-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -GTTTCTCCAGCATTC GCTTC-3 0 ; and b-actin, forward 5 0 -AGACTTCGAGCAGGAGATGG-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -CCATCATGAAGTGTGACGTTG-3 0 .
