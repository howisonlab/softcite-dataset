            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exhibits considerable genetic diversity resulting from the high mutation rate of reverse transcriptase, high viral turnover, viral genomic recombination, and immune and therapeutic selection pressures. This diversity is a challenge for viral load determination, drug resistance testing, and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) vaccine development. 1,2 Three phylogenetic groups of HIV-1, including main (M), outlier (O), non-M, non-O (N), have been recognized. Most HIV-1 infections are caused by group M viruses that comprise 9 clades (A-D, F-H, J, and K) and > 13 intersubtype recombinants known as circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). 3 The genetic distance of each subtype in HIV-1 is 20-35%, whereas the genetic distance within the same subtype is only 7-20%. 4 It is very important to consider the distribution of subtypes within a treatment population with the development and secondary transmission of drug resistant strains of HIV, as the data show that different subtypes have different sensitivity to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). 5,6 A deeper understanding of HIV-1 subtypes can also inform ongoing vaccine research better."

            "text": "Henan province is located in central China where in the mid-1990s thousands of paid blood donors were infected with HIV through the use of unsanitary equipments and the practice of reinjecting communally centrifuged red blood cells back into donors. After the banning of such practices in 1998, the Chinese government carried out the first mass screening of the former blood plasma donors (FPDs) in 2004 . By 2006, Henan was found to have 21,828 confirmed cases of AIDS, and 35,232 cases of HIV with 7,107 recorded deaths from AIDS. [7][8][9] Henan province has the second highest concentration of HIV/AIDS in the country, and 53% of all AIDS patients undergoing ARV treatment live in Henan. 10 Data collected from screenings in Henan have provided important information about the epidemiology of HIV in this community, but until now there has been little research into the subtypes distribution within this population. The following research and epidemiology analyses were carried out with 1287 HIV-1 samples found in Henan between year 2006 and 2007.",

Although some have attempted to establish a database of comprehensive molecular epidemiology data, budgetary, logistical, and time constraints have impeded past efforts. 14 Between 1996 and 1998, China launched a program known as the National HIV Molecular Epidemiology Investigation Research Plan in which a comprehensive survey of all HIV-1 subtypes in China was documented. HIV-1 subtypes, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, BC, were found in addition to HIV-2, and the study also investigated the distribution situation of different populations and geographical locations. Of the 19 confirmed samples of HIV-1 positive individuals from Henan, all were found to be Thailand subtype B'. From 2002 to 2004, the National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention (NCAIDS) launched the National HIV Molecular Epidemiology Investigation Database Program, and in its first project 1048 HIV positives samples from 26 provinces and municipalities were collected. 16 The results showed that 28 former paid blood donors from Henan were all of subtype B', confirming the results of the earlier survey study. [15][16][17][18] As an inland province in central China, Henan provincealong with Hubei, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Anhui-is relatively underdeveloped and its rural population was particularly vulnerable to the commercial blood/plasma collection that took place in the early to mid 1990s. 19 As a result of unsanitary practices, many FPDs were infected with HIV, eventually accounting for 9.7% of all infections in China by 2003. 20,21 In more developed areas of China such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Fujian, the most prevalent subtypes of HIV-1 are A, AE, BC and are primarily transmitted through heterosexual intercourse sex and needle-sharing practices among injecting drug users (IDU). 22,23 In developing areas including Henan and Anhui, however, the prevailing subtype is B', with a low percentage of subtypes C and AE, and the main transmission route is through unsanitary blood donation practices. 24 The most recent round of research on HIV-1 strains in Henan is the most comprehensive and large scale HIV molecular epidemiology investigation to date, with a total of 1,287 samples from 18 cities. In addition, the populations sampled include not only FPD but also female sex workers (FSW), IDU, and men who have sex with men (MSM). Because this data were combined with information from earlier molecular epidemiology surveillance work in the early stages of the HIV epidemic in Henan, the DISCUSSION results in this paper were based on the most comprehensive dataset available on the topic.",
