Post-THA LLD is associated with sequelae such as gait alteration [4 -7], low back pain [8], neurological deficits [9 -11] and patient dissatisfaction [12]. Leg length inequalities often necessitate corrective procedures, ranging from the use of contralateral heel lifts to full revision surgery, and have been associated with an increased risk of medical malpractice litigation [13,14]. The hospital costs related to revision surgery can be substantial, with per-procedure costs reaching $29,000 in the United States [15] and \u00a322,000 in Europe [16].",

The cumbersome and time-consuming nature of navigation systems can significantly increase surgical time [23,24] while also increasing the risk of infection [25]. The costs associated with navigation, including capital costs of up to $250,000 USD, plus software costs and service contracts [26 -28], result in increased per-procedure costs [27,29] that can be prohibitive [28].

Each observer was a trained orthopaedic surgeon with experience performing total hip arthroplasty using the posterolateral approach. Changes in leg length were calculated using the perpendicular distance between the inter-teardrop line and the most prominent aspect of the ipsilateral lesser C C A B A trochanter [32]. The difference between the pre-operative and post-operative leg length for each patient was calculated by each observer and then averaged to provide the final leg length change. An established software program (MATLAB, Mathworks, Natick, MA) was used to select radiographic landmarks and scale images. Pre and postoperative radiographs were corrected for abduction in order to minimize the artifact.",

It is designed to determine the level of agreement between two methods of measuring a clinical outcome. The resulting Bland-Altman plot allows for determination of bias between mean differences of two methods of measurement and creates an agreement interval (the \"statistical limit\"), within which 95% of the difference of one method, as compared with a second method, falls [36]. A limit for clinically relevant leg length discrepancy (the \"clinical limit\") was also included in the Bland-Altman plots.

At a cost of between $500-995 USD per case, and with no initial capital costs, the smart tool offers accuracy rivalling that of navigation systems at a substantially lower cost. The combined improvement in procedural time-add and the lower costs associated with the Intellijoint system suggest that it is a cost-effective option for THA. Robust cost-effectiveness studies are necessary to evaluate the potential cost savings associated with this system.",

The retrospective nature of the study also necessitated the use of standard radiographs to measure leg length. As such, no study-specific radiographic protocol was utilized. Also, pelvic radiographs, due to their 2-dimensional nature, are known to be susceptible to errors due to pelvic orientation, magnification, femoral abduction and femoral rotation [19,49,50]. Additionally, the pre-operative radiographs did not utilize a scaling object in the image. As a result, observers were required to assume that both pre and post-operative radiographs were to the same scale. These difficulties notwithstanding, AP radiographs are part of the standard of care for THA, as is their use for measurement of leg length and offset. The results of this study therefore mirror those of other studies in this field. To minimize the artifact associated with radiographs, future prospective studies will utilize strict radiographic protocols and pre and post-surgical scaling objects to minimize such errors.",

Current intraoperative methods of monitoring leg length changes rely on either manual techniques such as tissue tensioning or mechanical outriggers, or advanced surgical navigation systems that, while accurate, are both expensive and cumbersome.
