Material and methods: The retrospective evaluation included 50 patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC, who started cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Peripheral blood CBC values were collected for testing before chemotherapy and after the first and third cycles. Results: COPD was diagnosed in 49% of patients, while 42% of those enrolled were current smokers. Current smoking (p = 0.92) and COPD (p = 0.91) status did not affect the response to treatment. The non-COPD population presented a significantly higher pretreatment absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) than the COPD population (2.31 vs. 1.81 \u00d7 10 9 /l; p = 0.0374). Also, only the non-COPD group demonstrated an elevated absolute monocyte count (AMC) following the first and third cycles of chemotherapy (p = 0.004). In current smokers, pretreatment values for white blood cells (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and platelets (PLT) were higher than in the ex-smoker population (WBC 9.94 vs. 8.7 (\u00d7 10 9 /l); p = 0.01; ANC 6.47 vs. 5.61 (\u00d7 10 9 /l); p = 0.037; PLT 316 vs. 266 (\u00d7 10 9 /l); p = 0.049). Ex-smokers demonstrated AMC level elevation after the first cycle of chemotherapy and PLT level elevation after the third cycle, while current smokers also demonstrated an early decrease in LMR. Conclusions: COPD and smoking induce chronic systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which influence the results of standard laboratory tests, but do not change the response rate of lung cancer on chemotherapy.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is the most common newly-diagnosed malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, and the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In 2012, 1.8 million people developed lung cancer and approximately 1.6 million died because of it [1]. The following year, lung cancer was detected in about 21,000 patients in Poland, and about 22,000 died. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and has a strong aetiological association with smoking. About 10-20% of chronic smokers develop lung cancer, and about 20% of smokers suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cigarette smoking generates chronic inflammation in the airways and systemic oxidative-stress reactions. The pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties of cigarette smoke impair the immune response [2]. Inflammation seems to play a crucial role in the development and progression of many tumours by promotion of proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis, and migration [3].",

As detection is usually quite late, the tumours are found to be in stages III or IV for 2/3 patients with newly-diagnosed lung malignancy. Standard treatment for this population involves systemic therapy: induction chemotherapy in stage IIIA, chemoradiotherapy (concurrent or sequential) in stage IIIB, or palliative systemic treatment when distant metastases are present. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations are present in 10% of Caucasians [5], whereas EML4-ALK translocation is present in 2-3% of the non-Asian NSCLC population [6,7]. As most cases of NSCLC do not present a defined target for molecular orientated therapy, platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard approach in the treatment of lung cancer. The objective response rate (ORR), defined as a complete or partial response for cytostatic treatment of advanced disease, ranges from 30% to 40%.",

Established adverse clinical prognostic factors in advanced NSCLC are weight loss and poor performance status, which are also negative predictive factors of response to chemotherapy. Although the interaction between the immune system and cancer could play a crucial role in malignancy progression, the relationship remains poorly understood. As the morbidity and mortality rates are so high, it is important to explore the mechanisms that could modify the disease course and sensitivity to systemic treatment.",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is observed in about 50% of patients diagnosed with lung cancer [10,11]. Airflow limitation is an indicator of greater risk of respiratory complications and cardiac arrhythmias that may potentially affect the process of diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer [12,13]. An analysis of studies based on NSCLC patients following surgery revealed an association between the coexistence of both diseases and poorer prognosis [11,14]. However, a prospective trial of 324 patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC treated with systemic therapy revealed no significant differences in survival between the COPD and non-COPD groups [10]. Thus, the coexistence of COPD may adversely affect prognosis only in patients with early NSCLC, who are candidates for radical surgery. Our results are concordant with these observations.",

Based on these results it has been proposed that NLR be assessed as an independent prognostic factor for survival, regardless of cancer localisation [34][35][36]. In non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with EGFR-TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), elevated NLR (\u2265 3.5) was associated with lower objective response rate (52% vs. 79%), and shorter PFS (median 8.2 vs. 10.6 months; HR = 3.90) and OS (17.2 vs. 23.2 months; HR = 3.29) [37]. Among patients enrolled in the First-SIGNAL prospective study (non-smokers with adenocarcinoma treated with chemotherapy or EGFR-TKI), NLR was assessed at two points in time: at baseline and after one cycle of treatment. The study showed that significant reduction of NLR during treatment was associated with better tumour response (in the chemotherapy arm, median percentage changes of NLR in PR, SD, and PD subgroups were 50%, 41%, and 20%, respectively) and longer survival time (median OS 20.7 vs. 7.9 months) [38]. Another trial conducted in a typical population of patients with advanced NSCLC, with an NLR cut-off point of 2.63, documented that lower pretreatment NLR and its decline during chemotherapy correlated significantly with better response to chemotherapy [39]. Our analysis confirms the association between early NLR reduction and disease control: the change was observed in patients with PR and SD after the first cycle of chemotherapy, although a significant decrease was also observed after the third cycle in the PD population.",

In a prospective study of 210 patients with advanced NSCLC, the cut-off value for NRL at pretreatment was defined as 152.6. The study showed that elevated NLR was associated with poor response to first-line chemotherapy (OR = 4.50) and worse OS (HR = 2.03) [41]. Despite no differences in baseline PLR, our study showed early increase of PLR in the PR and SD groups. After the third cycle, PLR was higher than baseline in the PR group but lower in the PD population. COPD or smoking status did not affect PLR.",
