            "text": "Although the health effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) on the respiratory system have been reported, the fate, potential toxicity, and mechanisms in biological cells of these particles, as related to particle size and surface characteristics, have not been well elucidated. To determine the physicochemical properties of ZnONPs that govern cytotoxicity, we investigated the effects of size, electronic properties, zinc concentration, and pH on cell viability using human alveolar-basal epithelial A549 cells as a model. We observed that a 2-hour or longer exposure to ZnONPs induced changes in cell viability. The alteration in cell viability was associated with the zeta potentials and pH values of the ZnONPs. Proteomic profiling of A549 exposed to ZnONPs for 2 and 4 hours was used to determine the biological mechanisms of ZnONP toxicity. p53-pathway activation was the core mechanism regulating cell viability in response to particle size. Activation of the Wnt and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways was also important in the cellular response to ZnONPs of different sizes. The cadherin and Wnt signaling pathways were important cellular mechanisms triggered by surface differences. These results suggested that the size and surface characteristics of ZnONPs might play an important role in their observed cytotoxicity. This approach facilitates the design of more comprehensive systems for the evaluation of nanoparticles.",

However, the fate, potential toxicity, and cellular mechanisms of these particles are not well understood. Human contact with NPs is increasing, and regulatory guidelines are not presently available. Therefore, the development of reliable high-throughput in vitro test systems for use in product design and for cytotoxicity evaluations would be advantageous for assessing efficiency and for the extrapolation of NP effects to humans. Previous in vitro observations have been based on known toxicity mechanisms; 1,2 however, it is unclear whether these experiments provide sufficient toxicological information for comprehensive assessment of the potential toxicity of NPs.",

The samples were denatured and reduced with 8 M urea/10 mM dithiothreitol and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide. The samples were then digested with trypsin in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and desalted by C18 columns. The tryptic peptides were then analyzed using a Q Exactive\u2122 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Dionex UltiMate \u00ae 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were separated by liquid chromatography using C18 columns (75\u00d7150 mm, 2 \u03bcm, Dionex Acclaim \u00ae PepMap\u2122 RSLC; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The separation conditions have been described previously. 19 Full mass spectrometry (MS) scans were performed using ranges of m/z 380-2,000, m/z 380-600, m/z 600-800, m/z 800-1,200, and m/z 1,200-2,000, and the ten most intense ions from the MS scans were selected for MS/MS scans. The raw data were processed into peak lists using Proteome Discoverer 1.3 for Mascot database searching (Matrix Science, London, UK) and National Center for Biotechnology Information UniProt database prediction and literature searching. The search parameters included variable modifications for deamidation (NQ), oxidation (M), and a fixed modification for carbamidomethyl (C).

            "text": "With regard to the toxicology of ZnONPs, smaller particles, which have a greater surface area per unit mass than do larger particles, may be associated with higher bioreactivity. Additionally, differences in the surface characteristics of particles may also play important roles in the regulation of cellular bioreactivity. 23 For these reasons, the present study explored the feasibility of using proteomics to investigate cell viability in alveolar epithelial cells as a basis for the development of high-throughput screens and more focused assessments of the effects of size and surface characteristics of ZnONPs. Physicochemical characterization in toxicological experiments is a key step in NP toxicological testing. Considering the significance in determining the biological outcomes of ZnONP exposure and how important modifications can create \"safe-by-design\" nanoproducts, we investigated the dosedependent and time-dependent nature of the physicochemistry of ZnONPs. In this study, two different sizes of ZnONPs (ZnONP20 and ZnONP90) were used to investigate size effects, and the similarly sized ZnONP20 and Al-ZnONP20, but having different electrical and electronic properties, were used to investigate surface effects. No significant change in morphology was observed among these ZnONPs when dispersed in water or FBS solution. Previous studies reported that serum proteins act as an excellent dispersant for ZnONPs in biological solutions, 14,23 which is consistent with our finding that the addition of FBS dispersed ZnONPs well at various mass concentrations (20-500 \u03bcg/mL). However, dispersion in FBS-containing medium was reduced over time. We found reaggregation of ZnONPs occurred after 6 hours, especially at higher mass concentrations. Additionally, the hydrodynamic diameters of ZnONP20 and ZnONP90 partially overlapped, which may have contributed to the reaggregation of the particles over 48 hours. The zeta-potential values also slightly decreased over time. Taken together, these results suggest that serum proteins may be a good dispersant for ZnONPs, but the dispersive effects are only maintained for a short time, after which aggregation/agglomeration recurs. The use of other ZnONPs with distinct size distributions may be required in future studies. The stabilization of ZnONPs in serum primarily occurs through protein adsorption and the resulting net surface charge, as reported by Wells et al. 16 The alterations in the zeta potentials of the ZnONPs may result from the change in pH over a 48-hour period, which is supported by the work of Shahmoradi et al. 17 The ZnONPs leached Zn into the solution, and relatively stable Zn levels were maintained for 48 hours, which is similar to the findings of our previous study. 23 Cell viability is a common indicator in toxicological testing; however, alterations in cell viability also relate to the cutoff time. To obtain a better understanding of doseand time-dependent changes in cell viability, the real-time viability of A549 cells after exposure to ZnONP20, ZnONP90, or Al-ZnONP20 was monitored. We observed that the index of cell viability increased between 0 and 2 hours of exposure to the ZnONPs, even at a relatively high mass concentration (500 \u03bcg/mL). Notably, cell death occurred after a 2-hour exposure, reducing the cell-viability index. This finding suggests that a 2-hour exposure may be the longest that can be used for nanotoxicology testing of such particles as ZnONPs. To understand how NPs alter cellular bioreactivity before and after the 2-hour cutoff time point, protein profiling and the biological context of the identified proteins were determined. Proteins involved in apoptosis, the cell cycle, and reproduction were each present after exposure to ZnONP20 or ZnONP90 for 4 hours. Proteins involved in the generation of precursor metabolites and energy were characterized at 2 hours postexposure to Al-ZnONP20. Our findings were consistent with previous reports that ZnONPs induced cell death via apoptotic pathways 12,26 and alterations in the cell cycle. 27,28 The different biological processes activated in response to ZnONP20, ZnONP90, and especially Al-ZnONP20 could have resulted from particle-size and surface differences.",

            "text": "To determine the effects of the size and surface characteristics of ZnONPs on biological processes, protein-profile comparisons between ZnONP20 and ZnONP90 and between ZnONP20 and Al-ZnONP20 after a 2-hour or 4-hour exposure were performed. We found that the proteins of the cadherin signaling pathway, the circadian clock system, inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling, the p53 pathway, and the Wnt signaling pathway were present after a 2-hour exposure to ZnONP20. In contrast, proteins associated with the apoptosis signaling pathway and the blood-coagulation cascade were present after a 4-hour exposure. However, the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway was only identified after a 2-hour exposure to ZnONP90, whereas glycolysis, Huntington's disease, the integrin signaling pathway, and the p53 pathway were identified after a 4-hour exposure to ZnONP90. These findings suggest that smaller ZnONPs may have more acute toxic biological effects, such as activation of cell death, than do larger ZnONPs, but the results could also reflect the corresponding numbers of ZnONPs per unit mass. 29 Additionally, the cells showed activation of distinct biological pathways in response to ZnONPs of different sizes. The proteins of the Wnt signaling pathway, for example, were only expressed after exposure to ZnONP20, and the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway was only identified after exposure to ZnONP90. The p53-pathway proteins were present at 2 hours of ZnONP20 and 4 hours of ZnONP90 treatment, suggesting that the p53 pathway could be the core mechanism responsible for zinc-based NP-induced cell death. 26 We further showed that the WNT signaling pathway and the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway regulated different cellular fates in cells treated with ZnONP20 and ZnONP90, respectively. The Wnt and TGF\u03b2 pathways are crucial mechanisms for controlling cell differentiation and cell fate. Cho et al indicated that expression of TGF\u03b2 was associated with ZnONP exposure. 30 With regard to the differences in surface effects between ZnONP20 and Al-ZnONP20, our results demonstrated that the cadherin signaling pathway and the Wnt signaling pathway were active after a 2-hour ZnONP20 exposure and a 4-hour Al-ZnONP20 exposure. This result shows that cell fate and cell integration are important biological responses to smaller ZnONPs. Notably, the delayed biological effects could have resulted from the surface characteristics of the two ZnONPs. Therefore, an investigation of the correlations between the physicochemical parameters and cell death was conducted. Our results further showed that cytotoxicity might have been associated with zeta potential and pH. It is known that Al dopants in ZnO can significantly modify the electronic properties of the material. Xu et al reported that Al-ZnONP was more conductive than nondoped ZnO and that the electronic properties correlated with cytotoxicity. 31 Furthermore, the higher positive charge could be more toxic to cells. 5 The surface differences between ZnONP20 and Al-ZnONP20 were also related to the pH, which is supported by work from Chusuei et al. 32 Previous studies showed that Zn ion plays an important role in the regulation of ZnONP toxicity; 30,33 however this association was not observed in our study. The difference may be due to the leached Zn ion reaching a plateau for 0.5 hour, following a stable Zn ion level over 48 hours. Real-time alteration in cell viability caused by different concentrations of Zn ion should be investigated in future work.",

Notes: The index of cell viability increased between 0 and 2 hours of exposure to the ZnONPs, even at a relatively high mass concentration (500 \u03bcg/ml). Notably, cell death occurred after a 2-hour exposure, reducing the cell-viability index. Timedependent associations between cell viability and the physicochemistry of ZnONPs were determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Significant positive correlations were observed between cell viability and\\zeta potentials of ZnONP20 (r=0.89, P\ue02c0.01) and al-ZnONP20 (r=0.80, P\ue02c0.05). The alteration of cell viability by ZnONP20 was negatively correlated with ph (r=-0.83, P\ue02c0.05). statistical associations were not observed between cell viability and hydrodynamic diameter or zinc ion (zinc ion concentration).
