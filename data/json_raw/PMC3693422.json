Design: Longitudinal analysis of all 25(OH)D pathology tests in Australia. Setting: Primary and Tertiary Care. Measurements: The frequency of 25(OH)D testing between 1 April 2006 and 30 October 2010 coded for each individual by provider, state and month between 2006 and 2010. Rate of tests per 100 000 individuals and benefit for 25(OH)D, full blood count (FBC) and bone densitometry by state and quarter between 2000 and 2010. Results: 4.5 million tests were performed between 1 April 2006 and 30 October 2010. 42.9% of individuals had more than one test with some individuals having up to 79 tests in that period. Of these tests, 80% were ordered by general practitioners and 20% by specialists. The rate of 25(OH)D testing increased 94-fold from 2000 to 2010. Rate varied by state whereby the most southern state represented the highest increase and northern state the lowest increase. In contrast, the rate of a universal pathology test such as FBC remained relatively stable increasing 2.5-fold. Of concern, a 0.5-fold (50%) increase in bone densitometry was seen. Conclusions: The marked variation in the frequency of testing for vitamin D deficiency indicates that large sums of potentially unnecessary funds are being expended. The rate of 25(OH)D testing increased exponentially at an unsustainable rate. Consequences of such findings are widespread in terms of cost and effectiveness. Further research is required to determine the drivers and cost benefit of such expenditure. Our data indicate that adoption of specific guidelines may improve efficiency and effectiveness of 25(OH)D testing.",

            "text": "Concerns are increasingly being raised about the potential of medicine to harm the healthy. 1 Reports suggest that there is an increase in overscreening and overdiagnosis for conditions that would never cause symptoms, resulting in unnecessary labelling and overtreatment of healthy individuals. 1 Testing and diagnosis for 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D) are good examples. Testing and diagnosis has reached levels that raise serious questions as to the true prevalence of the disorder, the accuracy of testing methods, the cost benefit of diagnosis and treatment and whether this is being translated into improved health outcomes. In accordance with other Australian studies, 2 we recently reported that the prevalence 25 (OH)D deficiency in an Australian population was greater than expected, ranging from 33% in summer months to 58% in late winter and spring months. 3 In a separate study, we reported a massive increase in the frequency of testing for serum 25(OH)D levels over an 11-year period in Australia. 4 The rate of testing had increased from 40. 6  100 000 people) in the year 2000 to 3472.2 (tests/100 000 people) in 2011. As a result, the cost of testing for 25 (OH)D in Australia had increased from $1.0M in the year 2000 to $95.6M in the year 2010, or on average 59% each year. 4 Small reports from the USA and Canada have also indicated rising test trends and costs for 25(OH)D testing. 5 Similarly, the UK has seen a sixfold increase in 25(OH)D tests between 2007 and 2010. 6 The consequences of these findings are widespread in terms of better quantifying the magnitude of risk of 25 (OH)D deficiency for a given population as well as gaining a better understanding as to the best way of testing for the disorder to avoid unnecessary cost and the potential for overdiagnosis and overtesting. The aim of this study was to examine the pattern of 25(OH)D testing in individual patients over a 4.5-year period in Australia so as to inform the development of testing guidelines.",

Interestingly, the number of individuals who had one test in the third quarter was the lowest, yet the number of individuals who had two tests in that quarter was the highest, resembling the second quarter. When plotted as a whole, the seasonal periodicity showed that the highest number of tests was consistently performed in the third quarter ( June-August) and lowest number in the fourth quarter (September-November), which are in the winter and spring months, respectively (figure 1B). For the first quarter of each year, the proportion of individuals who had two tests increased approximately linearly from 2% in 2006 to 9% in 2010 (table 2). Similarly, for individuals tested in the second quarter, who had two tests, the proportion increased linearly from 9% to 22%; those tested in the third quarter increased from 20% to 39%; while those tested in the fourth quarter remained relatively stable from 2006 to 2010.

This improved access to testing alone has led to an increase in testing and subsequently, increased detection of vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <50 nmol/L). Hence, there has been an increasing number of studies which have been published showing a higher than expected prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency. 2 10 11 The common definition of vitamin D deficiency is a serum 25(OH)D concentration less than 50 nmol/L, 12 where the risk of adverse bone effects is well established. 13 A growing body of research suggests that 25(OH)D deficiency may also be involved in the development of numerous chronic conditions including cancer, 14 autoimmune disease, 15 cardiovascular disease 16 17 and diabetes, 18 as well as overall mortality 19 and adverse pregnancy outcomes, 20 other than its role in maintaining adequate bone density. However, most of these findings are from observational studies, for which the evidence is considered inadequate in comparison to randomised controlled trials, and therefore have not been formally accepted by review bodies. Conclusions from a 2011 consensus conference aimed at defining the term 'evidence-based nutrition,' suggests that when examining the effect of nutritional constituents on health outcomes, the totality of evidence be taken into account and it should be subject to it's own nutritional methodologies, as opposed to randomised trials which are required for pharmaceutical drugs. 21 Nevertheless, because of the new disease associations of 25 (OH)D deficiency, some have proposed raising the diagnostic threshold for 25(OH)D sufficiency to a level greater than 75 nmol/L.",

The greater rise in the rate of testing in states such as TAS suggests that awareness of the risk and implications of 25(OH)D deficiency is higher in these states as a consequence of TAS's high latitude relative to other Australian states and territories.

Drivers that may be relevant to the increase in 25(OH)D testing include the shifting threshold for adequate 25(OH)D levels, incidental diagnosis, failure to recognise normal fluctuations and poor timing of testing. 1 It has also been reported that industries that benefit from expanded markets or physicians wanting to increase their patient pool are major influencers on the rate of testing. 1 On the other hand, the increased rate of testing suggests that there may be value as a result of a greater awareness of the prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency. Further studies are required to determine whether this increased testing translates into improved 25(OH)D status of the population and subsequent health outcomes. A worrying trend, however, is that despite the magnitude of the rise in 25(OH)D testing this did not translate into increased testing for physiological endpoints associated with 25(OH)D deficiency, such as osteoporosis. 23 24 over the long term. 25 Our data showing marked variation in the frequency of testing in individuals further support calls for the adoption of more specific 25(OH)D testing guidelines internationally and in Australia. Implementation of clinical guidelines has been shown to improve the quality of healthcare by reducing morbidity, mortality and by increasing costeffectiveness. 26 27 A recent position statement advises against retesting before 3 months because it may take 2-5 months for serum levels of 25(OH)D to plateau. 28 Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to increase 25(OH)D levels by approximately 17 nmol/L for each 1000 IU each day, reaching a plateau around 8 weeks. 29 Simply advising against routine screening, as is the policy in Australia, is evidently inadequate in preventing excess testing. To illustrate by example, imposing guidelines to limit testing to three per annum: the first test to establish the diagnosis, the second to be performed 3 months after supplementation, and the third test 6 months after supplementation, to ensure that appropriate 25(OH)D concentrations are being maintained. If this approach was adopted, based on the current data, 552 509 tests would have not been undertaken at a saving of more than $20 million over the 4.5-year period. Still, others question the necessity of testing at all, and suggest that supplementation without testing in high-risk individuals is safe and effective. 30 This is also reflected in the endocrine society's recommendations to supplement the general population with 1000-2000 IU 25(OH)D. 12 Although, serum 25(OH)D has been shown to vary considerably among individuals following vitamin D supplementation, whereby one study has shown that 6100 IU vitamin D supplementation would be required to bring 97.5% of the population up to a serum 25(OH)D level of 74 nmol/L without evidence of toxicity. 31 Supplementation without 25(OH)D testing is linked to varying viewpoints; for instance, it has been postulated that blanket supplementation would result in substantial  NSW  58  120  120  157  219  294  544  967  1766  2684  3735  4233  VIC  69  144  144  200  345  480  891  1632  2804  4070  5195  5530  QLD  23  44  44  51  74  97  174  296  581  956  1435  1770  SA  19  84  84  143  224  321  521  871  1624  2383  3503  3769  WA  66  153  153  194  241  294  462  672  1082  1799  2702  3016  TAS  10  34  34  48  129  163  279  488  1048  2216  3576  4058  ACT  160  277  277  407  551  842  1446 2317  3178  4155  4798  5316  NT  18  reduction in global healthcare costs, [32][33][34] whereas others have shown that 25(OH)D deficiency, combined with lack of monitoring, predicted increased inpatient healthcare costs. 35 ",

Such guidelines would necessarily specify criteria for testing, such as diagnosis of 25 (OH)D deficiency disease or other indication of likely having low 25(OH)D levels, including many types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, dental caries, erectile dysfunction, obesity, osteoporosis, periodontal disease, respiratory infections, pregnant women and those admitted to the hospital for any reason. 15 As an alternative, current Australian vitamin D intake recommendations, which range from 200 to 800 IU, 28 39 could be increased in order to increase the number of people with serum 25(OH)D concentrations aimed at optimal health.",
