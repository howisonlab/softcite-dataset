            "text": "Despite the importance of airspace integrity in vertebrate gas exchange, the molecular pathways that instruct distal lung formation are poorly understood. Recently, we found that fibrillin-1 deficiency in mice impairs alveolar formation and recapitulates the pulmonary features of human Marfan syndrome. To further elucidate effectors involved in distal lung formation, we performed expression profiling analysis comparing the fibrillin-1-deficient and wild-type developing lung. NeuroD, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, fulfilled the expression criteria for a candidate mediator of distal lung development. We investigated its role in murine lung development using genetically targeted NeuroD-deficient mice. We found that NeuroD deficiency results in both impaired alveolar septation and altered morphology of the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells. NeuroD-deficient mice had enlarged alveoli associated with reduced epithelial proliferation in the airway and airspace compartments during development. Additionally, the neuroendocrine compartment in these mice manifested an increased number of neuroepithelial bodies but a reduced number of solitary pulmonary neuroendocrine cells in the neonatal lung. Overexpression of NeuroD in a murine lung epithelial cell line conferred a neuroendocrine phenotype characterized by the induction of neuroendocrine markers as well as increased proliferation. These results support an unanticipated role for NeuroD in the regulation of pulmonary neuroendocrine and alveolar morphogenesis and suggest an intimate connection between the neuroendocrine compartment and distal lung development."

MFS, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue caused by mutations in the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin-1, manifests with cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, ocular, and pulmonary abnormalities. We recently found that fibrillin-1-deficient mice display defects in airspace formation that mimic the lung phenotype observed in a subset of patients with MFS (1). Although MFS is a relatively uncommon disorder, we reasoned that the lung septation abnormalities seen in MFS might involve critically important molecular pathways that normally operate in the prealveolarization stage of distal lung morphogenesis. In this view, we investigated the role of NeuroD, a proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor as a leading candidate mediator of distal lung morphogenesis.",

            "text": "NeuroD is a member of a family of proneural bHLH proteins related by structural motifs that underscore concomitant roles in neural, endocrine, and neuroendocrine development (2). NeuroD family members function as differentiation genes, primarily serving to activate terminal differentiation of resident precursor cells (3). Although the lung exhibits many features of an endocrine/neuroendocrine organ, the role of proneural bHLH factors in lung differentiation and development has only recently been examined (4). Mice with a targeted deletion in Mash1, another proneural bHLH factor, do not develop pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) and die in the neonatal period secondary to respiratory failure. Unfortunately, because of early perinatal lethality, the distal lung phenotype cannot be fully characterized in this model. Gene targeting experiments have revealed critical roles for NeuroD in hippocampal, cere-bellar, retinal, and inner ear development (5)(6)(7), islet cell maturation in the pancreas, and enteroendocrine cell differentiation in the small intestine (8,9). Although targeted mice survive the neonatal period, a detailed examination of their lung phenotype has not been performed. Similarly, the role of other proneural bHLH factors (e.g. neurogenins and maths) in lung development is unknown.",

The reduction in solitary neuroendocrine cells and increase in neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) observed in NeuroD-deficient lung further implicate an important role for NeuroD in pulmonary neuroendocrine morphogenesis. Overexpression of NeuroD in lung epithelial cells imparts both a proliferative and neuroendocrine phenotype, suggesting a molecular link between neuroendocrine function and airspace morphogenesis.

In order to identify candidate mediators of distal lung development, whole organ gene expression profiling was performed on wild-type and fibrillin-1-deficient mice at PD1 and PD5. Upon pairwise comparison, we reasoned that candidate genes would be (a) down-regulated in the mutant lung compared with wild-type lung on PD5 and (b) increased in the wild-type PD5 lung compared with the wild-type PD1 lung (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, NeuroD, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, demonstrated a 25-fold induction in the wild-type PD5 lung compared with the wild-type PD1 lung and a 5-fold reduction in the fibrillin-1 PD5 lung compared with wild-type littermates. These results were confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR ( Fig. 1D). Since transforming growth factor-\u2424-neutralizing antibody restores normal septation in fibrillin-deficient mice, we determined whether NeuroD levels responded to this maneuver. We found a 10-fold induction of NeuroD expression in the wild-type lung upon treatment with antibody treatment but only a 1.5-fold induction in the mutant lung. This finding suggests that although NeuroD deficiency may contribute in a minor way to the lung phenotype in the fibrillin-1-deficient mouse, it is not a predominant mechanism. Since fibrillin-1 deficiency is associated with complex disturbances involving tissue structure, cytokine dysregulation, and recently angiotensin signaling, the lack of an intimate mechanistic association between NeuroD signaling and the fibrillin-1 phenotype is not unexpected (1, 16 -19). Nonetheless, we surmised, NeuroD might play a role in lung maturation distinct from the context of fibrillin-1 deficiency.",

In order to establish whether NeuroD is critically involved in distal lung morphogenesis, we examined the lung phenotype of mice deficient in NeuroD. These mice had known defects in pancreatic, enteroendocrine, cerebellar, and hippocampal morphogenesis, but their lung phenotype has not been examined. The homozygous mutant mice had a marked increase in distal airspace caliber at PD5 and PD10 compared with littermate controls, similar to our findings in fibrillin-1-deficient mice (Fig. 2, A and B). By adulthood, the airspace caliber remained significantly larger than the wild type controls but showed no progression compared with the PD10 mutant lung. Using markers of alveolar epithelial cells (TTF-1) and airway epithelial cells (CC10), we found preserved epithelial differentiation in the neonatal mutant lung (Fig. 2, C and D). Since airspace simplification can result from reduced proliferation or increased cell death in the lung parenchyma, we examined distal lung proliferation and apoptosis in the developing and adult lungs. We found a dramatic reduction (27%) in proliferation of airway and alveolar epithelial cells in the developing airspace and airway of the mutant lung (Fig. 3, A and B) but no difference in apoptosis by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling and active caspase 3 staining (data not shown). This profile contrasts with our finding of increased apoptosis but normal proliferation in fibrillin-1-deficient murine lungs. Importantly, the mitotic index falls to trivial levels in the mutant and wild-type lung by adulthood ( Fig. 3B) and is probably responsible for the inability to correct the airspace enlarge-ment after lung maturation. Taken together, these data suggest that the early airspace phenotype of these mice is not attributable to an altered epithelial differentiation program but rather to reduced epithelial proliferation.",

Since PD10 is beyond the point of expected pup loss but still within the terminal phase of lung alveolar development, our demonstration of persistent airspace enlargement suggests that the PD5 phenotype did not merely reflect mice that would ultimately die before adulthood (Fig. 2, A and B). However, in order to further establish that the PD5 and PD10 mice were comparable, we evaluated Mendelian ratios of respective genotypes.

Because neuroendocrine cells probably perform an endocrine function for the developing lung by secreting growth factors that are instructive for distal lung morphogenesis (10, 11), we considered whether NeuroD might be involved in neuroendocrine cell differentiation and function (21,22). We used the panneuroendocrine marker PGP9.5 to assess the morphology and abundance of neuroendocrine cells. Immunohistochemical studies employing antibodies against NeuroD and PGP9.5 revealed that NeuroD is expressed in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells within the distal airway (Fig. 4A). To explore the possibility that the reduction in NeuroD expression in the fibrillin-1-deficient lung was secondary to an abnormality in the neuroendocrine compartment, we examined the quotient of neuroendocrine cells in fibrillin-1-deficient lungs. We have previously reported that reduced neuroendocrine cell number and/or mass area correlate with altered neuroendocrine maturation (14). The total number of neuroendocrine foci (composed of NEBs and PNECs) was significantly higher in PD5 fibrillin-deficient mice compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 4B). However, the average size of NEBs in fibrillin-deficient animals was about 30% smaller than that in control mice (p \u03ed 0.056) (Fig. 4C). Thus, although there was a modest increase in neuroendocrine foci in the fibrillin-1-deficient lung (Fig. 4B), we found a trend toward reduction in the size of NEBs in the NeuroD mutant lung (Fig. 4C), consistent with impaired neuroendocrine maturation.",

Surprisingly, we found that neuroendocrine cells were present throughout airway and airspace development in the mutant lung ( Fig. 5A). Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells exist in two distinct morphologies: solitary PNECs and NEBs. The former subserves a primary secretory function, liberating mitogenic and vasoactive amines, and the latter is thought to act as a hypoxia and/or chemoreceptor (23,24). When we quantified the number of solitary PNECs versus NEBs in NeuroD-deficient mice, we found (a) a significant increase in the number of NEBs in the mutant lung, similar to the fibrillin-1 deficient lung, but (b) a striking reduction in solitary PNECs in the mutant lung (Fig. 5, B-D). Neuroendocrine hyperplasia attends several inflammatory and fibrotic lung disorders, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and cystic fibrosis, and is thought to contribute to these conditions via the liberation of profibrotic cytokines. Because solitary PNECs are thought to function primarily as endocrine cells without neural innervation, we considered whether the marked reduction in the number of these cells correlated with impaired liberation of mitogenic amines and reduced distal airspace cell proliferation.",

Although neuroendocrine cells are present in the primitive vertebrate lung, their resident precursor has not been identified. Notably, lineage tracing of surfactant protein C-expressing (SPC \u03e9 ) progenitors in the developing murine lung did not demonstrate CGRP \u03e9 neuroendocrine progeny in the perinatal period (25). By contrast, Wuenschell et al. (26) characterized a pluripotent cell type in the developing lung that expressed neuroendocrine, airway, and alveolar epithelial markers, suggesting that a common precursor might exist. In order to determine whether the overexpression of NeuroD in a nonneuroendocrine-derived cell line was sufficient to induce the neuroendocrine phenotype, we overexpressed a Myctagged NeuroD in a nonneuroendocrine mouse lung alveolar epithelial cell line (MLE12). Remarkably, NeuroD expression induced robust expression of chromogranin A and ACTH, both neuroendocrine markers and p21 expression ( Fig. 6A). We did not find repression of surfactant protein B or TTF-1, markers of lung epithelial cells (data not shown). Furthermore, using two different antibodies for NCAM detection, we found that Neu-roD expression induced high molecular weight NCAM140 expression ( Fig. 6B). Since Ito described opposing effects of  Mash1 and Hes-1 in neuroendocrine maturation, we surveyed both of these candidate mediators after NeuroD overexpression (27). Although we observed no change in the levels of Hes-1, we did see an induction of Mash1 at 24 h, consistent with its critical early role in neuroendocrine differentiation (Fig. S2). We also observed an induction of Gfi-1, a recently identified neuroendocrine determinant, in NeuroD-overexpressing cells (28). In summary, the whole cell studies suggest that NeuroD overexpression is sufficient to confer a neuroendocrine phenotype to lung epithelial cells.",

            "text": "Notably, we have recently shown that mice that are deficient in Gfi1, a determinant of neuroendocrine cell morphogenesis, display reduced airway cell proliferation after naphthalene injury (29). In order to connect the altered neuroendocrine developmental phenotype we observed in NeuroD deficient lungs with reduced epithelial proliferation, we examined whether overexpression of NeuroD in lung epithelial cells increased proliferation. We found a significant increase in proliferation in cells transfected with NeuroD compared with cells transfected with a control vector (Fig.  7A). Since we observed reduced proliferation in cells that did not express NeuroD in the airway and epithelium of the distal lung, we examined whether NeuroD-transfected cells secreted mitogenic factors (a known property of neuroendocrine cells) that induced proliferation in cells not expressing NeuroD. Conditioned medium from cells transfected with NeuroD promoted a \u03fe55% increase in proliferation compared with medium from vector-transfected cells (Fig.  7B). These data suggest that Neu-roD expression supports autocrine and paracrine proliferative signaling in lung epithelial cells. This mechanism may account for the widespread reduction in proliferation in the NeuroD-deficient lung.",

Additionally, the genetic and biochemical pathways that instruct neuroendocrine differentiation are unknown. Apart from the complete absence of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells in Mash1-deficient mice, no published genetically targeted model has shown alterations of neuroendocrine morphology using the most PNEC-inclusive marker, PGP9.5. Mice deficient for Gfi-1 have reduced CGRP-expressing solitary PNECs and NEBs but preserved abundance of PGP9.5-expressing cells (28). The combination of a marked reduction in solitary PNECs and expansion in NEBs that we show in the NeuroD-deficient lung supports integrative developmental regulation of these two structures. Two models reconcile this dual compartment mechanism. First, solitary PNECs may originate in the NEB niche, but at an early developmental time point, separate from the cluster. Accordingly, it remains possible that the lack of solitary PNECs in the NeuroDdeficient lung reflects an as yet undefined defect in the NEB niche. A second model is that solitary PNECs and NEBs may have a common resident precursor but develop as distinct, nonoverlapping entities, with only the former requiring NeuroD expression for terminal differentiation. The development of methods to reliably isolate these low abundance cells from rodent lungs would greatly facilitate our dissection of their differentiation programs.",

            "text": "The finding of impaired alveolar septation in the NeuroDdeficient lung seems discordant, given that NeuroD is not expressed in the airspace. The markedly reduced airway and airspace proliferation implicate a global perturbation in mitogenesis. Two mechanisms are plausible. First, since neuroendocrine cells liberate mitogenic amines that act in a local paracrine manner and which are known to be involved in lung morphogenesis, the reduced solitary neuroendocrine cell compartment might compromise the liberation of requisite promorphogenic factors during alveolar development. Our finding of NeuroD-induced proliferation in transfected MLE12 cells supports this mechanism. Second, the known diabetic  phenotype of these mice could exert antimorphogenic effects on the lung, an interaction that has been observed in human and animal models (38,39). Although the precise basis for the airspace phenotype is unclear, the finding supports an intimate interaction between lung morphogenesis and overall neuroendocrine function. Our induction of neuroendocrine marker expression in murine lung epithelial cells suggests that NeuroD expression is sufficient to confer a neuroendocrine phenotype. Leiter and co-workers (8) showed that NeuroD expression in HeLa cells promoted the expression of p21 and secretin. NeuroD overexpression in non-islet-derived pancreatic cell lines triggered a beta cell differentiation program exemplified by NKX2.2, pax4, and insulin induction (40,41). Our results demonstrate that nonneuroendocrine lung epithelial cells harbor the requisite machinery to drive differentiation into neuroendocrine cells upon overexpression of NeuroD. We observed that NeuroD induced a restricted repertoire of neuroendocrine markers. Therefore, multiple transcription factors may be required for the expression of the full repertoire of panneuroendocrine markers in a given lung epithelial cell. Alternatively, a given bHLH protein may activate the differentiation of a restricted subset of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells that express a defined repertoire of markers, a pattern observed in the enteroendocrine compartment (42,43). Ito et al. (27) demonstrated that NeuroD expression in the postnatal lung temporally coincided with Mash1 mediated neuroendocrine cell differentiation, suggesting some measure of cooperativity among these proneural factors.",

In fibrillin-1-deficient mice, the airspace lesion is progressive throughout postnatal life, whereas in the NeuroD-deficient lung, the airspace lesion improves but does not fully correct over time. These findings suggest that NeuroD may participate in the onset of alveolar septation but not the maintenance of the airspace architecture. By contrast, fibrillin-1 deficiency, in affecting the structural integrity of the airspace as well as the cytokine milieu, affects both the establishment and the maintenance of airspace architecture (1,17,19,44). We reported that not only does fibrillin-1 deficiency compromise airspace formation and maintenance, but it also contributes to late onset inflammatory emphysema that recapitulates acquired airspace enlargement. Simply stated, isolated NeuroD deficiency versus relative NeuroD deficiency in the context of fibrillin-1 deficiency leads to distinct airspace sequelae. In this view, our data suggest that NeuroD deficiency is not the sole or predominant determinant of the airspace enlargement observed in fibrillin-1-deficient mice; rather, primary structural distortions and secondary alterations in cytokines are the critical determinants of the more severe and sustained lesion evident in these mice.",

In keeping with this previously unrecognized capacity, we report increased proliferation in alveolar epithelial cells overexpressing NeuroD and in epithelial cells exposed to supernatants from NeuroD expressing cells. In the airway, NeuroD is a primary determinant of NE morphology, facilitating the generation of solitary PNECs plausibly from preexistent NEBs.
