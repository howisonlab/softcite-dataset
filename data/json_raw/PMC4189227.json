            "text": "Background: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac MRI (CMR) has been described as an independent predictive factor of cardiovascular events among patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). LGE and Q waves are considered as myocardial scar markers but their relation in the context of HCM is poorly established and has to be more supported. The objective of the study was to compare ECG findings in the presence or absence of LGE. Methods: 42 patients with HCM confirmed by CMR were included in the study. ECG abnormalities including abnormal Q waves and five ECG scores of left ventricular hypertrophy were assessed and compared according to LGE presence and its extension. Some CMR features, such as septal to posterior wall thickness ratio, were also studied according to the presence of LGE and the presence of abnormal Q waves. Results: Abnormal Q waves were more prevalent in the LGE (+) group (60% vs 12%; p=0.002), but there was no correlation between location of Q waves on ECG and territory of LGE on CMR. Among patients with LGE, quantitative analysis of LGE was not different in the presence or absence of Q waves. In contrast to the LGE mass, septal to posterior wall thickness was higher in patients with abnormal Q waves (2.3\u00b10.7 vs 1.6\u00b10.5; p=0.012). Conclusions: Although abnormal Q waves were more prevalent in the presence of LGE, no correlation was found with the LGE location and extent. These data suggest that abnormal electrical activation of the hypertrophied ventricular septum represented by a high septal to posterior wall thickness ratio seems to be an important mechanism of abnormal Q waves in HCM.",

This was again supported in a previous CMR study, but a key role was also given to the distribution of hypertrophy and particularly to the increase of the septal to posterior wall thickness ratio. 19 Indeed, abnormal electrical activation of the markedly hypertrophied septum compared to normal posterior wall thickness is another explanation to abnormal Q waves considering several echocardiographic, 17 38 ECG 39 and electrophysiological studies. 16 Consistent with this hypothesis, two studies exhibited a disappearance of abnormal Q waves after septal myectomy. 40 41 In our study, not only was the septal to posterior wall thickness ratio most common in patients with Q waves but also it presented with higher values, even among patients with LGE. This difference was present in segmental analysis considering DI-aVL Q waves, the most frequent Q wave location in our study. Thus, the hypertrophy pattern seems to be predominant in the pathophysiology of Q waves considering the lack of correlation of Q waves with the LGE location and its quantitative analysis. 19 The results of this study should be interpreted in the light of certain limitations. First, the retrospective nature of the study may have introduced selection biases. The number of patients is limited and in one single centre compared to some prospective or retrospective studies on HCM, 3 33 and hypertrophy was mildly severe considering a great number of focal and intermediate patterns as described by Maron et al and few massive septal hypertrophy (\u226530 mm) and few LV outflow tract obstructions \u226530 mm Hg. This limit could have biased the characteristics of these patients with HCM.",
