            "text": "Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of ultrasound, MRI and fluorine-18 fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18 F-FDG PET)/CT for the diagnosis of metastatic axillary lymph node (ALN) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and to find out histopathological factors affecting the diagnostic performance of these imaging modalities. Methods: From January 2012 to November 2014, 191 consecutive patients with breast cancer who underwent NAC before surgery were retrospectively reviewed. We included 139 patients with ALN metastasis that was confirmed on fine needle aspiration or core needle biopsy at initial diagnosis. Results: After NAC, 39 (28%) patients showed negative conversion of ALN on surgical specimens of sentinel lymph node (LN) or ALN. The sensitivity of ultrasound, MRI and PET/CT was 50% (48/96), 72% (70/97) and 22% (16/73), respectively. The specificity of ultrasound, MRI and PET/CT was 77% (30/39), 54% (21/39) and 85% (22/ 26), respectively. The Az value of combination of ultrasound and PET/CT was the highest (0.634) followed by ultrasound (0.626) and combination of ultrasound, MRI and PET/CT (0.617). The size of tumour deposit in LN and oestrogen receptor was significantly associated with the diagnostic performance of ultrasound (p , 0.001 and p 5 0.009, respectively) and MRI (p 5 0.045 and p 5 0.036, respectively). The percentage diameter decrease, size of tumour deposit in LN, progesterone receptor, HER2 and histological grade were significantly associated with the diagnostic performance of PET/CT (p 5 0.023, p 5 0.002, p 5 0.036, p 5 0.044 and p 5 0.008, respectively). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, size of tumour deposit within LN was identified as being independently associated with diagnostic performance of ultrasound [odds ratio, 13.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.95-57.96] and PET/CT (odds ratio, 6.47; 95% CI, 1.407-29.737). Conclusion: Combination of three imaging modalities showed the highest sensitivity, and PET/CT showed the highest specificity for the evaluation of ALN metastasis after NAC. Ultrasound alone or combination of ultrasound and PET/CT showed the highest positive-predictive value. The size of tumour deposit within ALN was significantly associated with diagnostic performance of ultrasound and PET/CT. Advances in knowledge: This study is about the diagnostic performance of ultrasound, MRI, PET/CT and combination of each imaging modality for the evaluation of metastatic ALN after NAC. Of many histopathological factors, only the size of tumour deposit within ALN was an independent factor associated with the diagnostic performance of ultrasound and PET/CT."

            "text": "Axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis is one of the most significant prognostic factors in patients with breast cancer. As the management of axillary lesions has been diverse, the detection of axillary nodal lesion has been more important. The diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and MRI for the detection of metastatic ALNs has been studied by many researchers. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for the detection of metastatic ALNs have been reported as 41.2-70.8% and 54.5-93.7%. [1][2][3][4] Sensitivity and specificity of MRI have been reported as 36-79% and 93-100%, respectively. [4][5][6] Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become the standard treatment not only in patients with locally advanced breast cancer but also in early invasive breast cancer in an attempt to downstage the primary cancer and to reduce micrometastasis. If the ALN metastasis is confirmed on fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) or core needle biopsy (CNB) at initial diagnosis, ALN dissection (ALND) is usually performed, regardless of the responsiveness of ALN. Residual metastatic lesion of ALNs after NAC is an important prognostic factor of disease-free survival. 7,8 In ACOSOG Z1071 trial, in patients with breast cancer with clinical N1 stage receiving NAC, if two or more sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were removed, the false-negative rate of SLN biopsy (SLNB) was relatively low, 12.6%. Therefore, the role of axillary imaging in NAC setting should be to find out metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) for surgeons to proceed directly to ALND. Another role could be to correctly diagnose negative LN to safely omit SLNB. Despite the importance of restaging of nodal status, there have been few studies about diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for detection of metastatic ALNs after NAC.",

All patients were instructed to rest comfortably for 60 min and to urinate before scanning. Wholebody PET-CT images were obtained with a Discovery ST scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Seven to eight frames (3 min per frame) of emission PET data were acquired in 3D mode after a non-contrast CT scan from the base of the skull to the upper thigh (tube rotation time of 1 s per revolution, 120 kV, 60 mA, 7.5 mm per rotation and an acquisition time of 60.9 s for a scan length of 867 mm). Emission PET images were reconstructed using an iterative method (ordered-subsets expectation maximization with 2 iterations and 30 subsets; field of view, 600 mm; slice thickness, 3.27 mm) and attenuation corrected with noncontrast CT. Two nuclear medicine physicians reviewed 18 F-FDG PET-CT images on an AW workstation (v. 4.4; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) by consensus. Focal 18 F-FDG uptake with intensity higher than that of normal background soft tissue on PET image was considered to be positive for metastasis. CT images were used for anatomic localization, but not for decision making. For the semi-quantitative analysis of 18 F-FDG uptake, standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated based on injected dose and body weight. Circular regions of interest were placed on the ALN and maximum SUVs (SUV max ) were recorded. When the lesion could not be visualized owing to a lack of 18 F-FDG uptake, an SUV of zero was recorded.",

A previous study reported that involvement of LNs at the time of surgery, not the initial axillary node stage, was significantly associated with distant disease-free survival. 11 In ACOSOG Z1071 trial, 12 in patients with breast cancer with clinical N1 stage receiving NAC, if two or more sentinel LNs were removed, the false-negative rate of sentinel node biopsy was 12.6%. The false-negative rate was significantly higher in patients with only one sentinel node dissection or when SLNs were mapped with a single agent (dye or isotope) than dual agents. In another prospective multicentre trial SENTINA, 13 the detection rate of SLNB before NAC was 99.1%. However, in patients with LN conversion after NAC, the detection rate of SLNB was 80.1% and the false-negative rate was 14.2%. Thus, the accuracy of SLNB was less favourable in patients after NAC than in patients who underwent SLNB without NAC. However, .50% of patients who had negative conversion after NAC could be spared from further ALND or regional treatment such as radiation therapy. 13 A previous study reported that sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of MRI for ALN evaluation after NAC were 85.7%, 89%, 92% and 80.9%, respectively. 14 In a recent study analysing the diagnostic performance of ultrasound, MRI and PET-CT for metastatic LN after NAC, 15 the sensitivity was 70%, 61% and 63% and the specificity was 58%, 59% and 85%, respectively. In a recent review article, 16 the sensitivity of ultrasound, MRI and PET-CT was 58-86%, 59% and 48-85%, respectively, for the detection of pathological complete remission of ALN.",

We think that the reason why MRI showed the highest sensitivity compared with ultrasound and PET-CT is that we could perform side-by-side analyses of the individual pairs of MR studies before and after NAC treatment concentrating on the changes of initially metastatic LNs. We could detect more remaining metastatic LNs with subtle eccentric cortical thickening of 3 mm on MRI than on ultrasound. Our results also revealed that the combination of ultrasound, MRI and PET/CT showed the highest sensitivity (81%) and PET/CT alone showed the highest specificity (85%)."

In the study of Kim et al, 18 SUV max on 18 F-FDG PET/CT was effective for the ALN evaluation in ER-positive/HER2-negative subtypes and in HER2positive subtypes. However, it was not effective in triple-negative subtypes. However, these studies are about the cases of primary surgery without NAC. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with biologically different phenotypes. Molecular subtype classification by gene expression profiling has led to a better understanding of tumour biology and behaviour. However, because of the high cost and technical complexity, IHC classification based on the expression of ER, PR and HER2 has been investigated as a substitute for the molecular gene profiling. This IHC classification showed good correlation with intrinsic molecular subtypes of luminal, HER2positive and basal-like forms. 19 Univariate analysis of our study demonstrated that the positive oestrogen receptor and positive progesterone receptor were associated with incorrect diagnosis rate of ultrasound, MRI and PET/ CT. This result is somewhat different from the previous study that demonstrated PET/CT was effective in ER-positive/HER2-negative subtype. 18 There have been many studies about the variable chemoresponsiveness according to the subtypes of breast cancers.",
