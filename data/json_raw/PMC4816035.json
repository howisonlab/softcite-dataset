            "text": "OBJECTIVES: Soluble CD163 (sCD163), a marker of Kupffer cell activation detectable in serum, correlates with inflammation and fibrosis in chronic viral hepatitis, but its role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is unknown. We hypothesized that sCD163 would correlate with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity and fibrosis. METHODS: Liver biopsies and serum were obtained from 145 obese subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Subjects were divided into four groups based on fibrosis stage and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS); Group 1: F0, NAS = 0; Group 2: Fo2, 0oNASo5; Group 3: NAS \u2265 5, Fo3; or Group 4: F \u2265 3, any NAS. Serum sCD163 and the monocyte/macrophage marker sCD14 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Relationships between sCD163, sCD14, fibrosis stage, and NAS were examined. Area under the receiver operating charateristic for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis based on the Clinical Research Network definition was calculated. RESULTS: sCD163 increased with progressive liver histology, with lowest values in normal histology and highest levels in those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis (Group 1: 552 ng/ml, Group 2: 721 ng/ml, Group 3: 803 ng/ml, and Group 4:1,031; P = 0.001). sCD14 also differed significantly across groups (Group 1: 1,877 ng/ml, Group 2: 1632 ng/ml, Group 3: 1,706 ng/ml, and Group 4: 2111; P = 0.008, respectively). sCD163 correlated with steatosis grade (Po0.001), lobular inflammation (P = 0.033), and hepatocyte ballooning (Po0.001). In a multivariable ordered logistic regression model, there was a significant association between every 100 ng/ml increase in sCD163 and higher fibrosis stage, with an odds ratio of 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.02-1.31), P = 0.020. The odds ratios of the association between every 100 ng/ml increase in sCD163 and higher NAS was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.32), P = 0.010. A sCD163-based predictive score demonstrated an area under the receiver operating charateristic of 0.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.82) for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Soluble CD14 did not correlate with fibrosis stage or NAS. CONCLUSIONS: In obese subjects, serum sCD163, but not sCD14, correlated with fibrosis stage and NAS. These data support a role for activated Kupffer cells in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis, and suggest potential clinical utility for assessment of sCD163 levels.",

            "text": "In the United States, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) afflicts~30% of the general population and is the leading cause of chronic liver disease. 1 NAFLD encompasses a broad spectrum of disorders, ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD that can lead to cirrhosis, 2 hepatocellular carcinoma, and the need for transplantation. [3][4][5] Distinguishing between simple steatosis and NASH, as well as the staging of NASH fibrosis requires histologic diagnosis via liver biopsy. Biopsies are invasive, expensive, and can result in serious complications. 6 Furthermore, they are subject to sampling error and interobserver variability. Therefore, there exists a need for accurate, non-invasive, and cost-effective testing to assist in risk stratification of NASH.",

            "text": "Although hepatic steatosis is a hallmark of NAFLD, hepatic inflammation has a key role in the pathophysiology of NASH and fibrosis. 7 The cause of this inflammation has long been debated, and may be directly due to free fatty acid or cholesterol accumulation within hepatocytes, 8 microbial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract leading to intrahepatic immune cell activation, 9 or alterations in gut microbiota. 10 The ability to detect hepatic inflammation and distinguish steatosis from NASH non-invasively would allow for rapid diagnosis of NASH and monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy without the need for serial liver biopsies. Circulating monocytemacrophage associated proteins might serve as biomarkers for NASH. CD163 is a hemoglobin scavenger receptor that is expressed by cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. 11 During cellular activation and inflammation, its soluble form (sCD163) is shed via proteolytic cleavage at the cell surface 12 and can be detected within serum or plasma. Kupffer cells, hepatic macrophages that have a key role in liver inflammation and fibrosis, express high levels of CD163 and represent over 80% of tissue macrophages, 13 raising the possibility that serum levels of sCD163 disproportionately reflect chronic hepatic inflammation. Indeed sCD163 has been examined in various liver conditions, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent work has shown sCD163 levels are elevated in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis compared with those with minimal or no fibrosis. 14 Soluble CD163 has also been shown to correlate with inflammation, specifically hepatic activity index, and fibrosis among patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. 15 In addition, in patients with cirrhosis of varying etiologies, elevated sCD163 levels are significantly associated with portal hypertension, Child-Pugh score, and model for endstage liver disease score. 16,17 There is a paucity of data on sCD163 in NAFLD. One study of liver biopsies from children with NAFLD found an association between CD163 staining and the severity of steatosis and fibrosis. 18 Soluble CD14 (sCD14) is another more general marker of monocyte activation, lipopolysaccharide, and bacterial translocation. CD14 is expressed on Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, 19,20 and serum sCD14 is elevated in cirrhotic subjects with ascites and evidence of bacterial translocation. 21 In a recent study of 113 subjects with NAFLD sCD14 correlated with histologic evidence of inflammation and fibrosis. 22 To our knowledge, the roles of sCD163 and sCD14 have not been compared in liver disease, and more specifically have not been explored in NASH. We hypothesized that both sCD163 and sCD14 would correlate with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, but sCD163 would have a stronger correlation with fibrosis and inflammation because of its relative specificity for the activation of Kupffer cells, which have a key role in liver injury and inflammation.",

First, the cohort of patients with NAS o5 (Group 2) had significantly higher sCD163 than controls (Group 1), suggesting that early hepatic lipid accumulation may be associated with Kupffer cell activation and inflammation, even potentially before it is visible histologically. Second, the level of sCD163 was even higher in those with NAS \u2265 5 and higher yet in those with advanced fibrosis, suggesting ongoing and increasing Kupffer cell/ macrophage activation throughout all stages of NAFLD. This activation persists even in those with advanced fibrosis. This confirms the recent study by Kazankov et al. 27 who also found sCD163 to be elevated in NAS \u2265 5 compared with those with NASo5 as well as in patients with bridging fibrosis compared with lower fibrosis stages. Therefore, preventing or inhibiting Kupffer cell activation may be a rational therapeutic strategy for all stages of NAFLD.",

Both are markers of macrophage activation, and both have been associated with tissue inflammation (e.g., carotid artery disease in HIV-HCV coinfection). 28 Although sCD14 has been associated with disease progression in HBV/HCV, 29 only sCD163 has been associated with fibrosis in HBV, HCV and HIV/HCV coinfection 14,15,30 as well as acute liver failure 31 and portal hypertension. 32 CD14 is a co-receptor for lipopolysaccharide along with toll-like receptor 4, and is expressed primarily on macrophages, but also neutrophils and dendritic cells. Its shed form, sCD14, appears to be a general marker of inflammation. In contrast, CD163 is highly expressed on Kupffer cells, and sCD163 is significantly higher in the hepatic veins compared with the portal veins. 17 Taken together these findings suggest that sCD163 is a marker of macrophage activation with a higher sensitivity for liver injury compared with other soluble markers. Soluble CD163 is not uniquely specific for the liver, however; elevated sCD163 is also associated with many conditions of immune activation: coronary plaque burden in HIV infection, 33 rheumatoid arthritis activity, 34 and, most interestingly in obesity. 35,36 The fact that in our study of obese patients sCD163 was further increased in those with significant liver disease demonstrates the potential utility of sCD163 in this population, and underlines the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.",

The data are crosssectional, and therefore exploratory, as individuals were not followed after gastric bypass surgery. Further longitudinal data are required to determine whether sCD163 levels change with disease regression or progression. Our cohort was limited to those with obesity warranting weight loss surgery and further exploration of the value of sCD163 in non-obese individuals with NAFLD as well as in the general NAFLD population is needed. Nonetheless, levels of serum sCD163 in those with NAS = 0 (Group 5) are similar to those reported in other \"healthy control\" groups, 39 supporting the role of sCD163 as a specific marker of hepatic inflammation. The use of obese controls in this study and including body mass index as a covariate aims to eliminate obesity as a potential confounder. Finally, only 10 subjects had advanced fibrosis, and 5 of these had NAS scores consistent with NASH, suggesting that the association of sCD163 and fibrosis scores may be confounded by concomitant steatohepatitis. However, previous studies 14,15 have reported a correlation between sCD163 and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.",
