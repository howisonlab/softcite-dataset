Materials and Methods: We investigated the effect of genetic variations of CDH13 (rs3865188) on blood chemistry and adiponectin levels in 345 CVD patients undergoing statin-free or statin treatment. Results: Genetic variation in CDH13 was significantly correlated with several clinical factors, including adiponectin, diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride (TG), and insulin levels. Subjects with the T allele (mutant form) had significantly lower adiponectin levels than those with the A allele. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), TG/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) ratio, and HDL3b subtype were markedly decreased in statin treated subjects regardless of having the A or T allele. TG and TG/HDL in the statin-free group with TT genotype of the rs3865188 was higher than in the others but they were not different in the statin-treated subjects. We observed a significant difference in adiponectin levels between patients with the A and T alleles in the statin-free group; meanwhile, no difference in adiponectin levels was noted in the statin group. Plasma levels of other cytokines, leptin, visfatin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), were not different among the CDH13 genotypes according to statin administration. Body mass index (BMI), TG, insulin, HDL3b, and TG/HDL ratio showed negative correlations with adiponectin levels. Conclusion: Plasma adiponectin levels and TG/HDL ratio were significantly different according to variants of CDH13 and statin administration in Korean patients with CVD.",

            "text": "increases anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression in monocytes and macrophages. Exogenous administration of adiponectin also decreases allergic airway inflammation in mice. 4 In spite of its anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects, adiponectin is potentially associated with adverse clinical outcomes, such as mortality. As plasma adiponectin levels are strongly influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the gene encoding T-cadherin [the cadherin 13 preprotein (CDH13)], several studies had been conducted to examine the possible associations between CDH13 genotype and plasma adiponectin levels. 5 CDH13, a 95 kd glycoprotein, is an atypical member of the cadherin family of cell adhesion molecules. 4 Unlike classical cadherins, it has low adhesive characters and is attached to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, as it lacks both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. 6 CDH13 functions as a negative regulating molecule during the development of the nervous system and is involved in migratory processes, tumorigenesis, and angiogenesis. 7,8 Moreover, CDH13 is involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. Several studies suggested CDH13 is upregulated in endothelial cells after induction of ER stress and protect these cells from apoptosis in reaction to the proapoptotic response. 9 Another report observed that GRP78, a molecular chaperone similar to CDH13, was involved in pro-survival responses to ER stress, as a signaling partner to CDH13, along to the surface of endothelial cells. 10 Recently, several CDH13 SNPs, such as rs3865188, have been reported to be determinants of blood adiponectin levels in Asians. The association of rs11646213 in CDH13 and blood pressure phenotype has also been investigated in European cohorts. Another SNP, rs4783244, was also shown to be associated with metabolic syndrome phenotype in Taiwanese. 11 However, the association between CDH13 variations and cardiometabolic disease is not completely clear.",

Subjects who exhibited positive results for dyslipidemia on three separate visits and patients who had taken anti-hyperlipidemic medications such as statins were also included. For further analysis of the association between genetic variants and other metabolic traits, the study population was divided into two groups: a statin-free group and a statin group. We analyzed the effects of CDH13 rs3865188 on blood chemistry with statin groups compared to the statin free groups.

In the additive model, adiponectin level was not associated with a decreased risk of dyslipidemia (OR=0.732, 95% CI, 0.349-1.545, p=0.406) (data not shown). Subjects with the A allele had higher adiponectin levels than those with the T allele in the statin-free group, but there were no differences in statin groups (Table 2). There was also a difference in TG/ HDL levels between subjects with the T allele and those with the A allele in the statin-free group. Moreover, there was no difference in TG/HDL and adiponectin levels in the statin group. The subjects with a minor T allele of rs3865188 had higher LDLc and MCP-1 levels, whereas those with rs3865188 had lower insulin levels in the statin group (p=0.003). Statin treatment strongly decreased TC, LDLc, TG/HDL ratio, and HDL3b subfractions regardless of having the A or T allele, respectively. In the statin-free group, subjects with the TT genotype of the rs3865188 SNP had lower adiponectin levels (p=0.032) and higher TG levels (p=0.025) (Fig. l). In the statin group, however, the TT genotype was strongly associated with reductions in TG levels and in TG/HDL. Plasma adiponectin levels were significantly increased for individuals with the AT genotype and those who underwent statin treatment.",

First, we found that plasma adiponectin levels decreased according to CDH13 genotypes, in order to from major AA to minor TT types. Although the mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of CDH13 is not clear, a nucleotide variant in the promoter region is asso-  Correlation of adiponectin and clinical variables according to genotype distribution of rs3865188. Body mass index (BMI) was negatively correlated with adiponectin in only the AA genotype (p=0.009) in contrast to the TT genotype in statin group; meanwhile, AT genotype can be offset by TT genotype, compared to AA and TT genotype (A and B). Plasma adiponectin was related with TG in A allele of patients taking statin (C and D), and it was related with TG/HDL ratio in the AT genotype in statin-free group. However, with statin treatment, the effect of AT genotype disappeared (E and F). TG, triglyceride; HDL, high-density lipoprotein. ciated with increased promoter activity, and also plays a crucial role in its expression. 18,19 Even though rs3865188 is not located in the promoter region of CDH13, we demonstrated in the present study that this variant is positively associated with adiponectin levels. 18 This is similar to the findings of previous studies, and our results suggest that the CDH13 variant rs3865188 may regulate adiponectin levels. The traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including age, sex, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and body mass index, have been reported. 20 Another study investigated the role of T-cadherin expression in regulating adiponectin levels, and the involvement of CDH13 or adiponectin levels in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. 11 Furthermore, several reports have found that CDH13 variants have modulating effects on metabolic traits, and they increase the risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic stroke. In contrast to these previous studies, rs3865188 variants were not associated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases including dyslipidemia in our study. However, TG, TG/HDL, and adiponectin levels according to CDH13 genotypes or allele types might be changed by statin administration. This suggests that increases in plasma adiponectin levels upon statin administration are strongly associated with particular genes. We also found that CDH13 SNP (rs3865188) is strongly associated with metabolic traits, including BP and plasma levels of FBS, insulin, and TG and that adiponectin levels are not negatively associated with dyslipidemia described by TG/HDL. Recently, an association between a CDH13 SNP and BP was identified in a subsequent genome-wide association study. In particular, carriers of the minor allele of CDH13 rs11646213 showed a decreased risk of hypertension, while carriers of rs3096277 and rs254340 (located in intron 11) showed an association with BP. 21 Evidence of the involvement of CDH13 in BP regulation was demonstrated in another population-based cohort (Framingham Heart Study). 21 In hypertension subjects, minor allele carriers of rs12444338 had a lower risk of hypertension, although the association was marginal after adjusting for confounders. In addition, the mean carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was significantly associated with rs12444338 (p=0.02) and rs1048612 (p=0.02). 22 In this study, genotypes of the SNP rs3865188 were also associated with DBP. Interestingly, we observed lower insulin levels with increased adiponectin levels in statin-treated subjects with the T allele, compared to statin-free groups with the A allele. CDH13 strongly influences circulating adiponectin levels and is associated with a beneficial metabolic profile: the positive relationship between adiponectin and insulin sensitivity in East Asian populations appears to be causal. 23 In the present study, plasma adiponectin levels were negatively associated with TG and TG/HDL ratio in patients with the AT genotype in the statinfree group. In the statin group, however, the effect of the AT genotype disappeared, because adiponectin levels was increased by statin administration. We found that statin treat-ment significantly decreased TC, LDLc, TG/HDL ratio, and HDL3b fraction, compared to statin-free individuals, and increased adiponectin in persons having mutant alleles of the CDH13 gene. In general, a shifting toward small-sized HDL was changed by serum TG or TC elevation. Besides, serum TG level is a more important factor to change the components of small HDL such as HDL3b or HDL3c, compared to serum TC level. 16 Even though we do not know whether adiponectin causes these lipid abnormalities and, thus, whether it is partly responsible for atherogenic risk, high TG/HDL is associated with low plasma adiponectin concentrations in nondiabetic women. 24 In our study, the interaction between CDH13 gene and statin may effect HDL subpopulations according to changing plasma TG and TC levels.",

The secretion of biologically active molecules including MCP-1 has an ominous impact on atherogenesis. Nevertheless, adiponectin has a protective effect against the development of cardiovascular disease, and its levels are reduced in metabolic syndrome. 27,28 The use of drugs such as statin for treating dyslipidemia and its modifying effects on lipid profiles has been the focus of recent studies, which suggest that therapeutic targeting of inflammation may be used as a strategy to decrease cardiovascular risk. 29 Some reports show that the use of rosuvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, leads to a significant reduction in cardiovascular events in individuals without dyslipidemia with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, a marker of systemic inflammation. 30 In the present study, statin did not affect inflammatory cytokines, such as MCP-1, leptin, visfatin, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. Meanwhile, patients in the statin group with the TT genotype exhibited higher MCP-1 levels than those in the statin-free group.

Other genes examined include only APOA5 or cholesterol 7-\u03b1 hydroxylase. One report detected a potential variant within the APOE/C1/C3 gene cluster that could influence statin treatment efficacy, and another pilot study suggested that the rs4149056 variant within the SL-CO1B1 gene had possible sex-dependent effects on statin treatment efficacy. 31 CDH13 is highly expressed in several tissues, including the heart, aortic wall, neurons of the brain cortex and spinal cord, and small blood vessels, as well as in a variety of cell types, such as vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, cardiomyocytes, and cancer cells. 11,32 Reports on cellular signaling have observed that both LDL and adiponectin are specific ligands for T-cadherin, a product of CDH13. The binding of LDL or adiponectin to T-cadherin stimulates the nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling pathway, which plays an important role in inflammation, and serves as a link between obesity and vascular disease. 19,33 In addition, T-cadherin might modulate vascular remodeling, neointima formation, inflammation-related phenomena, and atherosclerosis development by regulating the adiponectin levels in the blood and various tissues. 21 In the present study, we showed the contribution of variants of CDH13 to statin treatment efficacy.

First, we could not find any reports that provided an explanation of the association between the CDH13 polymorphism and statin treatment efficacy. There is abundant research demonstrating the association of adiponectin levels and the CDH13 gene in several populations. However, we observed that studies in which genes that affect statin treatment efficacy have been identified, including the APOE/C1/C3 gene cluster, do not provide sufficient data to demonstrate the association of CDH13 and statin treatment. A similar problem was encountered in our study. Second, only one variant of CDH13 (rs3865188) was examined in our study; this is not sufficient to effectively evaluate the association between the CDH13 gene and adiponectin levels. Third, we did not perform any analysis to predict the effects of pharmacotherapy, and the individual efficacy of a drug was determined through genetic analysis only.",

The results of genetic analyses conducted in the future may help clinicians select the most effective and safe treatment for each individual patient. Although the economical and health benefits of such approaches are evident, we are still at the early stages of this research and only beginning to understand the genetic factors that determine statin treatment efficacy. Nevertheless, the novel variations within CDH13 may be utilized for better clinical management of coronary artery diseases in the future.",
