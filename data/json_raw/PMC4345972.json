A total of 138 patients with schizophrenia were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression, and Global Assessment of Functioning. Based on the selected criteria, 94 patients were included in the treatmentresponsive and 44 in the treatment-resistant group. All subjects and 94 controls were genotyped for the 5-HT1A rs6295 and 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms. There were no statistically significant differences in the frequencies of these polymorphisms between the patients with schizophrenia and the control group and between the treatment-resistant and treatment-responsive group of schizophrenia patients. Polymorphisms rs6295 and 5-HTTLPR had an influence on the Global Assessment of Functioning scale score, while 5-HTTLPR also had an influence on the total score of the negative subscale within the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Although we found no effect on progression toward the treatment-resistant schizophrenia, our data suggest that the rs6295 and 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms can influence some clinical symptoms in schizophrenia."

            "text": "Treatment-resistant schizophrenia represents a significant public health problem. Studies have shown that one-fifth to one-third of patients with schizophrenia do not respond to treatment. 1 These patients have persistent positive psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations), more pronounced negative symptoms (apathy, blunted affect, lack of spontaneity, and emotional withdrawal) and more pronounced cognitive symptoms (memory and attention impairment) than treatment-responsive patients. 1 Furthermore, they stay in the hospital longer and have a very low level of functioning in the community. 2 A recent American study showed that schizophrenia is a group of heritable disorders caused by a moderate number of separate genotypic networks associated with several distinct clinical syndromes. 3 The serotonin system plays an important role in schizophrenia. The role of genetic variants of serotonin (5-HT) receptors in treatment-resistant schizophrenia has already been investigated. 4 The serotonergic system is involved in the pharmacological mechanisms of atypical antipsychotics, which are widely used for the treatment of schizophrenia. 5-HT1A is a subtype of the serotonergic receptor that has an important influence on dopamine release. 5 When serotonin acts on 5-HT1A receptors, it accelerates dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex and consequently improves the negative, cognitive and affective symptoms of schizophrenia. 5 5-HT1A receptors have an important role in the modulation of mood, cognition and motor behavior 6 and in the control of nonpsychotic symptoms, 7 which is an important clinical issue in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The main indication of clozapine is treatment-resistant schizophrenia, 8 in which it acts as a weak partial agonist at the level of 5-HT1A receptors. 9 In 1999, Wu and Comings reported a common polymorphism in the promoter region of the 5-HT1A gene, 10 which was later shown to have a significant association with schizophrenia. 11 The serotonin transporter (5-HTT), encoded by the SLC6A4 gene, is a major regulator of serotonin function. 12 5-HTT is specific for serotonin and helps to terminate its actions by pumping it out of the synapse. 5 5-HTTLPR is a 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of SLC6A4 that has been frequently studied in a number of psychiatric disorders. 13,14 It has also been shown to have an important association with schizophrenia. 15 Indeed, some previous studies examined the influence of 5-HTTLPR variants on the symptoms and treatment response in schizophrenia. 16,17 An early response to antipsychotic treatment is important for schizophrenia patients, as it predicts further treatment effectiveness. 18 Classification of the genes responsible for heritable components of various psychiatric disorders is crucial to the advancement of our understanding of the underlying neurobiology and pathology of complex psychiatric diseases. 19 As responses to psychotropic medication are complex, the identification of the key phenotypic measures for their definition is still a major issue in psychiatry and pharmacogenomics and has as yet been only partially implemented in the clinical setting. 20 The present study investigated the association between the genetic variants of the 5-HT1A and SLC6A4 genes and the clinical symptoms and development of treatment-resistant schizophrenia.",

Their psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), 21 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), 22 Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale, 23 and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). 24 The inclusion criteria for the treatment-resistant group were based on the definition of Conley and Kelly 1 and included patients who did not respond to treatment with at least two different antipsychotics (at least one being atypical) at doses equivalent to more than 400-600 mg chlorpromazine, for a period of 6 weeks. Furthermore, they showed a moderate item score (\ue0244) on at least two of four symptom items according to PANSS (P2, P3, P6, and G9) and at least moderately severe illness as rated by the total BPRS score (\ue02445), with no stable period of good social and/or occupational functioning within the last 5 years. 1 The inclusion criteria for the treatment-responsive group were based on those of Andreasen et al 25 and van Os et al. 26 Treatment responders had achieved remission and had an item score of \ue0233 on the selected symptom items according to PANSS (P1, P2, P3, P6, N1, N4, N6, G5, and G9). The exclusion criteria were the presence of another mental or somatic disorder, poor compliance to treatment, and the occurrence of important side effects during previous antipsychotic treatments. Healthy blood donors constituted the control group. The chlorpromazine-equivalent daily dose of antipsychotics administered to each patient was calculated according to the guidelines for atypical antipsychotics, 27 for fluphenasine decanoate, 28 and for classic antipsychotics. 29 The study was approved by The Slovenian Ethics Committee for Research in Medicine.

Blood samples (5 mL) were taken from patients, and cells from the blood donation were retrieved for the control group. Genotyping was performed blind to the patient clinical status and was carried out using fluorescence-based competitive allelespecific polymerase chain reaction (KASPar) assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (KBiosciences, Herts, UK). Two functional polymorphisms were studied, 5-HT1A rs6295 and 5-HTTLPR. The dominant allele model was followed and the CG and GG genotypes for 5-HT1A rs6295 were grouped. For the 5-HTTLPR genotypes, a two-stage genotyping approach was used, with the biallelic 5-HTTLPR genotypes (L and S alleles) determined first. The SS and SL genotypes were grouped as in previous studies. 12,16 In the second step, the A \u2192 G substitution within the L allele was identified, so that the L A represented the common allele and the L G the polymorphic allele. The L G allele can be considered similar to the S allele in terms of transcriptional efficiency. 30 The frequencies of the SL and L A L G S alleles for 5-HTTLPR were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P=0.94, P=0.24, respectively). The frequencies of HTR1A rs6295 were not in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P=0.012), but matched those found in the single-nucleotide polymorphism database. The frequencies of HTR1A rs6295 in the control group were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P=0.103).",

A PET (positron emission tomography) study reported that 5-HT1A receptor binding potential values were lower in all brain regions in subjects with 5-HTTLPR SS or SL genotypes than in those with LL genotypes. 33 The lower transcriptional efficiency associated with the S allele of the 5-HTTLPR may lead to decreased 5-HTT function, which in turn may lead to a lifelong increase in 5-HT tone, which may in turn desensitize and downregulate 5-HT1A receptors. 33 Our data showed no significant influence of the 5-HT1A rs6295 allelic variants on the occurrence of schizophrenia, although some studies have indicated this association. 11 Similarly, there was no increased risk for treatment-resistant schizophrenia in the 5-HT1A variants, although activation of these receptors can influence adult neurogenesis 34 and might therefore influence the clinical outcome of the disease.   The 5-HTTLPR allelic variants also had no influence on increased risk for schizophrenia, which is consistent with prior studies. 35 Furthermore, no association was found between 5-HTTLPR and treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, a Croatian study reported that 5-HTTLPR SS carriers were less likely to develop treatment-resistant schizophrenia compared to those with all other 5-HTTLPR genotypes and that L A S carriers were almost three times more likely to develop treatment-resistant schizophrenia compared to SS carriers. 36 Reduced function of the serotonin transporter means higher serotonin concentrations for downstream regulation of 5-HT receptors and could probably play a factor in creating more favorable conditions for antipsychotic treatment, with a reduced probability of developing treatment-resistant schizophrenia. 36 The difference from our study could be explained in the different sample size and different inclusion criteria for the treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In the Croatian study, there were 53.2% of treatment-resistant patients, 36 which is a considerably higher percentage than in our study.",

The GAF score was also shown to correlate with positive and negative symptoms, as well as with agitation levels. 37 Although no significant associations were found between the 5-HT1A rs6295 variants and the other clinical scores, it can be assumed that the CC genotype is associated with better patient functioning. These data are in agreement with the suggestion that the occurrence of a G allele at this locus prevents the binding of putative repressor proteins, which leads to enhanced gene expression and reduced serotonergic neurotransmission. 38 Other studies have reported similar data, with the G allele being involved in reduced serotonergic neurotransmission. Two studies described an association between the CC genotype of 5-HT1A rs6295 and greater improvement in negative symptoms following treatment, compared with the CG or GG genotypes. 39,40 An association was also found between the L G or S alleles and higher GAF scores or lower scores on the negative subscale of PANSS, while other studies have reported conflicting data regarding this association. An American study reported that the LL carriers had worse clinical schizophrenia outcomes when compared with the LS/SS carriers. 16 On the other hand, in a Korean population, the SS genotype of 5-HTTLPR was found to be connected to a higher negative symptom score and general psychopathology score, compared to the LS/LL carriers. 41 The S allele has even been associated with violent suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia. 42 A Slovenian study showed that the L G or S alleles of 5-HTTLPR are associated with lower improvement in schizophrenia symptoms during treatment. 43 In patients with depressive disorder, the L variants of 5-HTTLPR were associated with a higher probability of remission and response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 44 Theoretically, the L and S alleles can differentially modulate the transcription of the SLC6A4 gene. The S allele reduces the transcriptional efficiency of the gene, which results in reduced 5-HTT expression and serotonin uptake. 12 Evidence suggests that the L G allele might have a transcriptional activity similar to that of the S allele, while only the L A allele increases transcriptional activity. 45 However, it is possible that other mechanisms, such as regulatory posttranslational processing of 5-HTT, can influence receptor activity. 46 Our study had several limitations. Treatment resistance was defined retrospectively and a part of the initial group of patients could not be classified because of insufficient information. The criteria for treatment-resistant schizophrenia remain to be fully defined. A number of studies have proposed criteria for treatment resistance in patients with schizophrenia, 8,47 as well as the guidelines for their treatment. 48 Furthermore, the P-values were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The data should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size and borderline statistical significance, so there is a chance of false-positive findings.",

The 5-HT1A rs6295 and the 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms have an influence on global patient functioning, and the 5-HTTLPR has an influence on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, neither of the polymorphisms have any impact on the development of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Because a limited sample size was used, these findings should be replicated in larger data sets."
