The aim of this study was to assess the apoptotic effect of opium on Jurkat T lymphocyte cells. Methods: Different concentrations of opium (2.86 \u00d7 10-3 to 2.86 \u00d7 10-11 g/ml) were added to 24-well plates containing 5 \u00d7 10 5 Jurkat cells. Apoptotic events were assessed after 6, 24, and 72 hours by flow-cytometric detection of surface phosphatidylserine. Findings: Significant differences in apoptosis of Jurkat cells were seen at 24 and 72 hours in different concentrations of opium (P < 0.05). After 72 hours, significant increase in necrosis of Jurkat cells was seen in opium concentration of 2.85 \u00d7 10-3 g/ml compared to cells without opium (control) (P < 0.05). Conclusion: These results showed that opium directly increases apoptosis and necrosis of T lymphocytes. This effect may play a role in immune dysfunction in opium addicts."

            "text": "Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a natural process for removing damaged and aged cells. 1 Apoptosis is an essential physiological process in differentiation and development of normal brain. It also has an important role in a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. 2 Various internal and external stimuli can result in apoptosis. 1 Different studies have already been performed about the apoptotic cell death due to many chemical, synthetic, and natural compounds. The apoptotic effects of some alkaloids such as morphine, heroine, codeine, noscapine, and papaverine have been demonstrated. 3 Opium includes 8-17% morphine, 1-10% noscapine, 0.5-1.5% papaverine, and 0.7-5% codeine. 4 Our previous study showed that chronic opium treatment can induce brain and liver cell apoptosis in rats. It was, however, the only report on apoptotic effects of opium. 1 It has been reported that opiate addicts are vulnerable to common infections. 5 Morphine induces apoptotic pathways in Jurkat cells. 6 In addition, chronic use of morphine can inhibit the immune system by reducing both the spleen and inguinal lymph node volume, and white blood cells (B and T lymphocytes and plasmablasts). 7 Moreover, it has been reported that opioids modulate antibody and cytokine secretion and decrease the proliferation rate of multiple myeloma cells through opioid receptor activation. 8 The alteration of peripheral blood T and B lymphocyte proliferative responses were seen in heroin addicts. 9 According to another study, clinical concentration of morphine (10 -8 M) induces apoptosis in human leukemia (HL-60) and human alveolar epithelial (A549) cell lines and necrosis in breast cancer (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 or MCF7) cell line. 10 Contrary to the above results, Ohara et al. concluded that morphine does not induce apoptosis in lymphocytes. 11 Noscapine, an opium derivative, induces apoptosis via increasing the activity of caspase -2, -3, -6, -8 and -9 and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation in human myeloid leukemia cells (HL-60 cell line). 12 Apoptotic effect of papaverine, another opium derivative, on mouse aortic smooth muscle cells and coronary endothelial cells has also been recognized. 13 Codeine decreases proliferation, genotoxicity, and apoptosis in Ramos cells. 14 However, opium is a mixture of 20 different alkaloids 15 and 70 various compounds. 16 Its effects on cell functions can hence be different from pure morphine, noscapine, codeine, and papaverine. Since most of the studies on morphine and other opium derivatives have been performed on specific cells in culture medium, we decided to investigate the apoptotic effect of opium on Jurkat cells, as a T lymphocyte model, to evaluate the effects of opium on immune cells.",

            "text": "The results of the present study showed reductions in cell survival due to increased opium in the Addict Health      21 In spite of the widespread and long history of opium consumption, studies in this regard have been very limited. Despite the existence of several reports about the effects of the most important components of opium including morphine, codeine, noscapine, and papaverine on programmed cell death in various tissues and cells, these studies have specifically focused on effects of one derivative. 6,[12][13][14] Morphine increases the synthesis of regulating pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g. P53 and Bax) in the exposed cells. 22 It also induces apoptosis in Jurkat cell line. 6 Previous research has emphasized on the role of morphine in increasing DNA degradation in human peripheral blood cells. [19][20][21][22][23] It has been reported that morphine enhances apoptosis in murine macrophages 24 and reduces macrophages and B-cells in the spleen. 8 It has also been demonstrated that morphine induces macrophage apoptosis and thereby leads to bacterial infections in mice. 25 However, long-term and short-term effects of morphine are different. 26 In a study about the effects of morphine on cell proliferation, it was claimed that morphine at concentrations higher than 10 \u00b5mol inhibits tumor cells proliferation. Its concentrations of above 500 \u00b5mol were found to induce apoptosis. 27 In contrast to many researchers who have shown morphine-induced apoptosis in various cells including lymphocytes, some others have indicated that morphine does not have apoptotic effects on lymphocytes. 11 Suppressive effects of morphine on lymphocyte apoptosis via blocking P53-mediated death signals have also been suggested. 28 Apoptotic role of some other major derivatives of opium, such as noscapine and papaverine, has also been reported. One study showed that noscapine induces apoptosis through increasing the activity of caspase-2, -3, -6, -8 and -9 and DNA fragmentation in human myeloid leukemia cells and HL-60 cell line. 12 Moreover, pharmacologic doses of noscapine induce apoptosis of tumor cells in breast, lung, colon, and ovarian cancers. 29 It can act as an anti-tumor agent which arrests cell mitosis and induces apoptosis. Noscapine binds tubulin and alters its conformation. It arrests mitosis through affecting microtubules assembly in mammalian cells. 30 Papaverine, which is commonly used in the treatment of spinal vascular spasm, induces apoptosis in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscles. 13 Toxic effects of codeine on human cancer cells has been demonstrated in various studies. Codeine, at concentrations of 1-6 mM, dose-dependently decreases proliferation and causes genotoxicity and apoptosis in Ramos cells. 14 Codeinone, an oxidized derivative of codeine, dose-dependently induces apoptosis in HL-60 cell line through DNA fragmentation, cytochrome C release, and inducing caspase-3. 31,32 .",
