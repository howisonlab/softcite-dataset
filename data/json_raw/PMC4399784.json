            "text": "This study was conducted to identify predictors of self-reported academic performance in undergraduate medical students at Hawassa University. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study involving 592 undergraduate medical students was conducted in November 2012. The academic performance of the study subjects was measured by self-reported cumulative grade point average (GPA) using a self-administered questionnaire. Data were entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16 software. Pearson's bivariate correlations, multiple linear regression, and multiple logistic regression were used to identify predictors of academic performance. Results: The self-reported academic performance of students had been decreasing as the academic years progressed, with the highest and lowest performance being in the premedicine (mean GPA 3.47) and clinical I (mean GPA 2.71) years, respectively. One hundred and fifty-eight (26.7%) of the participants had ever been delayed, 37 (6.2%) had ever re-sat for examination, and two (0.3%) had ever been warned due to academic failure. The overall variation in selfreported academic performance of the students was 32.8%. Participant age alone explained 21.9% of the variation. On the other hand, university entrance examination results, substance use at university, and medicine as first choice by students were identified as predictors of variation in self-reported academic performance, accounting for 6.9%, 2.7%, and ,1% of the variation, respectively. Students who had never used tobacco, alcohol, or khat after starting university were twice as likely to score a self-reported cumulative GPA above 3.0 (adjusted odds ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.25-3.02) and less likely to be delayed, have to re-sit an examination, or be warned (adjusted odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.29-0.77). Conclusion: Only 32.8% of the variation in self-reported academic performance was explained by the studied variables. Hence, efficacious mechanisms should be designed to combat the intervenable determinants of self-reported academic performance, like substance use and a low medical school entrance examination result. Further studies should also be undertaken to gain a better understanding of other unstudied determinants, like personality, learning style, cognitive ability, and the system used for academic evaluation."

            "text": "Academic performance is a key component of medical education that is used by governing bodies like ministries of education and health and universities to assess whether a medical graduate is sufficiently competent and fit to practice medicine. 1,2 It is also used to identify students who are displaying the appropriate level of competence, to enable students to ascertain their own academic progress, and to predict the future performance of students. 1,3 The purpose of medical education is to ensure that students meet the ethical, clinical, technical, and scientific standards expected of a good physician. 4 Therefore, academic performance of medical students should be evaluated continuously. 5 In developed countries, various studies have revealed that a number of factors affect the academic performance of undergraduate medical students. Prior academic achievement, such as medical school entrance examination result, 6,7 cognitive ability, 8,9 personality, 10,11 learning style, 12 and stress at medical school 8 were among the identified factors. There is a scarcity of scientific evidence on determinants of academic performance among medical students in developing countries like Ethiopia. However, studies done on substance use among university students found that use of substances like khat and cigarettes negatively affected academic performance. 13,14 Khat is a stimulant drug derived from a shrub (Catha edulis) found in Eastern Africa and Southern Arabia. Leaves of the khat shrub are held in the cheek or chewed as gum, and release their stimulants cathinone and cathine. These chemicals are structurally similar to amphetamine and have a similar stimulant effect on the brain and body. 15 Ethiopia, one of the developing countries in Eastern Africa, suffers from a shortage of health professionals, particularly physicians. According to the 2011/2012 report of the Federal Ministry of Health, the physician to population ratio was 1:28,847. 16 This figure is far below the international standard recommendation of 1:10,000. 17 Recently, the Ministry of Education, as well as the Ministry of Health, in Ethiopia aimed to increase the number of physicians by opening new medical schools to increase the number of medical students. 18,19 Despite the increased intake of medical students each year, the number of students graduating from these schools is still not as high as needed, largely due to a high attrition rate. Attrition is of concern, because it is a waste not only of the students' time, effort, and money, but also for medical academic institutions and the government. 20 As it is normal for some students in an educational institution to perform well while others do poorly, even after receiving the same services, researchers are curious to know what makes some students perform poorly. The findings of the current study would help in assisting policy-makers and implementers to come up with policies and strategies that can be employed to improve academic performance, in addition to generating evidence about predictors of self-reported academic performance among medical students in Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed at identifying the predictors of academic performance in undergraduate medical students.",

The questionnaire was developed by the authors after reviewing the relevant literature on the subject. Based on their training background, students were divided into two main categories: preclinical (years 1 and 2) and clinical (years 3 and 4 and internship). To minimize the non-response rate, data were collected for each batch of students immediately after they finished written examinations or after bedside teaching; the data collection was conducted in lecture halls. Data collectors as well as the supervisors were trained assistant lecturers from other campuses at HU. Instructions on how to complete the questionnaire correctly, particularly on how to follow skip patterns, was given to the study subjects before embarking on completing the questionnaire. After the questionnaires were collected back from the students, the supervisors checked all questionnaires for completeness."

Regression diagnostics were done for the fitness of model. The correlation between each of the explanatory variables was less than 0.7, and the variance inflation factor was #5. Moreover, linearity and other assumptions were guided under the umbrella of central limit theory because the sample size was very large."

Those students whose university entrance examination result was 66%-70% (AOR 3.05, 95% CI 1.25-7.47) and 71%-75% (AOR 3.81, 95% CI 1.91-4.29) were more likely to have scored a self-reported cumulative GPA of 3.0 and above than students whose entrance examination result was #65% (Table 6). When the predictive validity of university entrance examination results as a predictor of self-reported academic performance was tested using a receiver operating characteristic curve, the point of the curve that was closer to the left  upper quadrant of the x-y axis yielded a sensitivity of 0.61 and 1 -specificity of 0.33. The threshold point that minimizes the trade-off between the sensitivity and specificity of the university entrance examination result was at 72.25%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was found to be 0.68 (95% CI 0.64-0.73). Although the university entrance examination result was associated with the student's self-reported academic performance, an area of 0.68 under the receiver operating characteristic curve implies that the university entrance examination result was poor in setting the threshold for a dependent variable, in this case self-reported academic performance. We also noted an association between participant age and academic performance, with the odds of having a self-reported cumulative GPA $3.0 being 70% less for students aged older than 22 years (AOR 0.30, 95% CI 0.20-0.44) when compared with their younger counterparts ( Table 5).",

However, the effect of student age on performance at medical school is a controversial issue. Older students in several studies did less well in scientific reasoning and tended to be graded with lower scores at the beginning of their courses, basically in the 1st year of their medical studies. [30][31][32] However, recent studies show that older and more mature medical students performed better than their younger counterparts. 33,34 Student age warrants very careful attention when interpreting the findings of the current study, given that this was at the point of data collection not the age of entry to medical school. It is very difficult to conclude that older students are performing less well than their younger counterparts, because being older could be due to academic delay, a longer time spent at medical school, or a difference in the nature of the academic years rather than age alone.",

Similar rates of khat use have been found in other studies in Ethiopian high schools (18.4%), 27 universities (19.6%), 28 and medical schools (14%-33.1%). 13,24 There was a significant difference in mean self-reported cumulative GPA between substance users and non-users. Substance use alone explained 2.7% of the variation in selfreported academic performance, and students who were not substance users were twice as likely to self-report a cumulative GPA $3.0 and less likely to be delayed, have to re-sit, or be warned than their counterparts. This finding is consistent with the findings of a study conducted among medical and health officer students at Jimma University. 13 Similar studies in Ethiopia 14 and Saudi Arabia 42 found that chewing khat is a risk factor for frequent absenteeism from class and poor academic performance in students. A recent study done in the same study area also found that absenteeism was higher among substance users, 43 indicating that substance use has a negative influence on academic performance, perhaps as a result of the waste of valuable time and energy spent chewing khat, absenteeism from class, and lack of concentration during class due to insomnia.",

It used self-administered questionnaires and instruments, so the reliability of the data could be questioned since bias might have been introduced, resulting in underreporting or overreporting. Further, there could have been some recall bias in students' self-reported GPAs. We recommend future studies designed with appropriate ethical considerations taken into account in order to be able to use students' academic records to assess their academic performance. The cross-sectional design of our study is also a limitation, because the presented associations lack cause-effect relationship. However, we included a representative sample of all undergraduate medical students from year 1 to internship, with a large sample size and a high response rate. Thus, it is possible to generalize the results internally for all medical students at HU. However, generalizability to medical students attending other medical schools might be limited."

Other factors known to influence academic performance, such as student motivation, personality, evaluation system, and learning style, should be studied in the future. It would be important to pay extra attention to students with a lower entrance examination result, substance users, and older students, particularly during the clinical years. More education to promote awareness of the harmful effects of substance use in medical schools is needed."
