The second-best electric vehicle purchase subsidy ranges from $2,785 in California to \u2212$4,964 in North Dakota, with a mean of \u2212$1,095. Ninety percent of local environmental externalities from driving electric vehicles in one state are exported to others, implying they may be subsidized locally, even when the environmental benefits are negative overall. Geographically differentiated subsidies can reduce deadweight loss, but only modestly.",

            "text": "Three main considerations motivate our analysis. First, prior studies of electric vehicles have focused on calculating the emissions of electric vehicles but have not had a conceptual framework for analyzing electric vehicle subsidies. 4 We analyze a model of vehicle choice, which gives us the theoretically sound and intuitive result that the subsidy should be equal to the difference in lifetime damages between an electric vehicle and a gasoline vehicle. Our theoretical framework also allows us to address additional policy questions regarding the best policies for different jurisdictional levels and the welfare gains from policy differentiation. 5 Second, despite being treated by regulators as \"zero emission vehicles,\" electric vehicles are not necessarily emissions free (see, for example, National Academy of Sciences 2010). In 2014, the US Department of Energy reported that nearly 70 percent of electricity generated in the United States is produced by burning coal and natural gas. In many locations, the comparison between a gasoline vehicle and an electric one is really a comparison between burning gasoline or a mix of coal and natural gas to move the vehicle. However, average emissions of regional power plants can be a misleading indicator of the environmental impact of electric cars because all power plants do not respond proportionally to an increase in electricity usage and because electricity flows do not respect regional (e.g., state) boundaries. 6 To assess the emissions from charging an electric vehicle, we use an econometric model to estimate the effect of charging an electric vehicle on the marginal emissions of multiple pollutants at each power plant. 7 Third, there are significant physical differences between emissions from gasoline and electric vehicles. This is due to the distributed nature of the electricity grid, the height at which emissions occur, and the chemistry of fuel combustion. As a result, pollutants and emissions rates may be spatially distinct even if gasoline and electric vehicles are driven in the same place. For local pollutants, an additional problem is that the same vehicle driven in different places leads to different damages. For this reason, many prior studies consider only carbon dioxide. 8 We use an integrated assessment model to value damages across local and global pollutants for both electric and gasoline vehicles. 9 3 http://energy.gov/eere/vehicles/ ev-everywhere-grand-challenge-does-10-year-vision-plug-electric-vehicles (accessed October 17, 2016).",

These benefits can be large and positive, large and negative, or negligible, depending on the location. For example, California has relatively large damages from gasoline vehicles and a relatively clean electric grid, which implies large positive environmental benefits of an electric vehicle. These conditions are reversed in North Dakota. The variation in the sign of the environmental benefits stems almost entirely from local air pollution. If we account only for greenhouse gases, then electric vehicles are superior to gasoline vehicles almost everywhere. Using our model, we determine the welfare maximizing subsidies on electric vehicle purchases. We refer to these subsidies as second-best, but we stress that they only account for the relative differences in environmental impacts from driving electric and gasoline vehicles in the short run. Even in locations like California, subsidy values are significantly less than the current federal subsidy. The national average subsidy for the purchase of an electric vehicle is estimated to be \u2212$1,095. Thus, on average in the United States, the second-best purchase policy is a tax, not a subsidy.",

At the state level, 91 percent of local pollution damages from driving an electric vehicle are exported to states other than the state in which the vehicle is driven. In contrast, only 19 percent of local pollution damages from driving a gasoline vehicle are exported to other states. This discrepancy casts doubt on the efficacy of policy selected by local regulators. It is not obvious whether a given state will consider full damages (damages across all states), or only native damages (those damages which actually occur in the given state) when setting policy. Moreover, state regulators face incentives in current air pollution policy that emphasize within-state consequences of emissions. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) emphasize compliance with ambient pollution limits within states. Although there are constraints on the extent of exported pollution, especially from power plants, the NAAQS clearly encourage local compliance. This leads state regulators to focus on in-state damage and hence prefer a technology that exports pollution to other regions. The difference between using full and native damages in determining the second-best subsidy may be considerable. Accounting for full damages, the second-best subsidy is positive in 11 states. Accounting for only native damages, the second-best subsidy is positive in 32 states.",

First, it only captures air pollution emissions associated with driving or charging the vehicles. It does not account for \"upstream\" environmental externalities associated with producing either fuels or vehicles. Second, it is based on the electricity grid in the years 2010-2012 and current gasoline vehicle technology. 11 Over time, both the grid and gasoline vehicles may become cleaner. Third, it depends on marginal emissions from an increase in the demand for electric power to charge electric vehicles. This may not be appropriate when electric vehicles comprise a substantial fraction of the vehicle fleet. Fourth, it ignores preexisting environmental polices such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards and cap-and-trade markets for various local pollutants. For each of these caveats, we consider the degree to which they affect our calculated environmental benefits. For example, accounting for CAFE standards leads to an additional environmental cost of $1,555 per vehicle, whereas if there were a binding cap on SO 2 the additional environmental benefit would be $2,280 per vehicle.",

Any such long-term benefits may be at least partially offset by the short-term costs associated with current electric vehicle use. Our analysis provides an estimate of these short-term costs. Moreover, by shedding light on issues related to differentiated regulation and pollution export, we provide a policy framework for subsequent analysis of long-term issues.",

These pollutants account for the majority of global and local air pollution damages and have been a major focus of public policy. 24 Our set of electric vehicles includes each of the 11 pure electric vehicles in the EPA fuel efficiency database for the 2014 model year. 25 Our set of gasoline vehicles is meant to capture the closest substitute in terms of non-price attributes to each electric vehicle. Wherever possible, we use the gasoline-powered version of the identical vehicle, e.g., the gasoline-powered Ford Focus for the electric Ford Focus. 26 To determine the emissions per mile for each gasoline vehicle, we integrate data from several sources. 27 For CO 2 and SO 2 , emissions are directly proportional to gasoline usage, so we use conversion factors in the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model scaled. 28 We differentiate urban and nonurban counties by using the EPA's city and highway mileage. 29 For NO x emissions, we use the Tier 2 emission standards for the vehicle \"bin.\" For PM 2.5 and VOCs, we combine the Tier 2 standards with GREET estimates of PM 2.5 emissions from tires and brakes and VOC emissions from evaporation. The implication of this procedure is that emissions per mile for each gasoline vehicle only differ across urban and nonurban counties. 30 24 We do not analyze emissions of CO and toxics like mercury.

The algorithm used to compute damages per ton herein has been used in prior research (Muller and Mendelsohn 2009;Muller, Mendelsohn, and Nordhaus 2011). Briefly, this entails the following steps. With all sources in the United States emitting at their reported level in 2011, exposures, physical effects, and monetary damages are computed. Then, for an emission from a particular power plant, AP2 adds one ton of SO 2 , for example, to reported emissions for 2011. Exposures, physical effects, and monetary damage are re-computed. The incremental damages per-unit mass is tabulated as the difference in monetary damage between the baseline case and the add-one-ton case.",

As discussed above, local governments may be more concerned about native damages rather than full damages. We use the AP2 model in a novel way to determine both types of damages. To determine full damages, we follow the usual procedure and aggregate damages at all receptors. To determine native damages, we only consider damages that occur at receptors within the state or county of interest. For example, driving a gasoline vehicle in Fulton County, Georgia, creates a plume of pollution concentrated in a few counties. Gasoline native damages for Fulton County correspond to the portion of the plume that harms Fulton County. Driving an electric car in Fulton County leads to an increase in emissions from various power plants, as specified by the econometric model. The resulting plumes of pollution cover a number of counties. Electric native damages for Fulton County correspond to the portions of the plumes that harm Fulton County.",

These regional differences in emissions reflect the pollution intensity of the fuels used in each region's generating capacity as well as its electricity imports from other regions. There is some variation in damages across the charging profiles. Our baseline results are based on the EPRI charging profile, in which most electric vehicle charging occurs at night. However, damages could be reduced in the Midwest (MISO and MRO) by over 1.5 cents per mile by charging between 1 pm and 4 pm, for example.

The top panel of Figure 1 illustrates the damages (in cents per mile) for the gasoline Ford Focus by county. 42 All results are in 2014$ and all summary statistics are weighted by VMT. The counties with large damages correspond to major population centers because air pollution damages are mostly comprised of premature mortality risks. These damages are summarized in the middle columns of panel A in Table 2. For the gasoline Ford Focus, mean damages are 1.86 cents per mile (the equivalent of $0.51 per gallon) but range from about $0.01 per mile to over $0.04 per mile. 43 Notice that there is substantial overlap in the distributions of damages from gasoline and electric vehicles. If these damages were highly correlated, then the environmental benefits of an electric vehicle would be small in most counties. In fact, the damages are not highly correlated (the correlation is 0.07). As a result, the environmental benefits vary substantially, as shown in the right columns of panel A in Table 2. For example, gasoline vehicle damages are large in Los Angeles (due to the large population and properties of the airshed) but electric vehicle damages are small (due to the clean Western power grid). In this situation, the environmental benefits are almost equal to gasoline damages (i.e., $0.03 to $0.04 per mile) and hence electric vehicles have substantial environmental benefits. The opposite occurs in the upper Midwest where gasoline vehicle damages are small (due to low 43 Mean damages per gallon of gasoline range from $0.48 to $0.62 across the vehicles. For the Ford Focus, damages across counties range from $0.37 to $1.12 per gallon. population densities) but electric vehicle damages are large (due to the prevalence of coal-fired generation in the region and the temperature adjustment to electric vehicle range). Here the environmental benefits of an electric vehicle are negative, and are almost equal to the electric vehicle damages. Overall, the environmental benefits are negative on average for each of the electric vehicles in Table 2, panel A. 44 The electric Ford Focus is the median electric vehicle in terms of environmental benefits, and we focus on it throughout the results section. Panel B in Table 2 decomposes the environmental benefits into global benefits and local benefits. Just about every electric vehicle, in just about every place, creates global environmental benefits relative to gasoline vehicles. In contrast, the local environmental benefits from electric vehicles can be positive or negative depending on the place. But on average, for all electric vehicles, the negative local environmental benefits outweighs the positive global environmental benefits. Focusing solely on global environmental benefits provides a misleading impression of the environmental consequences of electric vehicles. 45 Using Proposition 2, we can convert the environmental benefits into the second-best purchase subsidy by assuming that both the electric vehicle and the gasoline vehicle are driven 150,000 miles. 46  Figure 2 shows the second-best subsidies by county. Except for a few counties around New York City and Atlanta, the subsidy is negative throughout the eastern part of the country (i.e., it is a tax on the purchase 44 This is due in large part to the fact that only 30 percent of the VMT occurs in the three regions with the lowest marginal damages from electricity (see the last column of Table 1). 45 Several prominent online sites that compare gasoline and electric vehicles (EPA, Union of Concerned Scientists) only consider global environmental benefits. 46 We assume both vehicles have ten year lifetimes, regardless of the number of miles driven, and that both are driven 15,000 miles a year in the absence of any taxes on miles. In practice, vehicle life depends on both years and miles driven. Moreover, it is not clear whether electric vehicles will be driven more (due to lower costs per mile) or less (due to the inconvenience of charging) than gasoline vehicles. of electric vehicles). The subsidy is large and negative in the upper Midwest. On the other hand, it is positive in most places in the West, and quite large in many counties in California. Overall, the second-best subsidy ranges from about positive $5,000 to negative $5,000.",

The MSAs with the highest environmental benefits are all in California because electricity generation in the West does not produce much air pollution. In these MSAs, the environmental benefits are about $0.02 to $0.03 per mile (a second-best subsidy of up to $5,000). The MSAs with the lowest environmental benefits are all in the upper Midwest, again because of the prevalence of coal-fired power stations. Here the environmental benefits are \u2212$0.03 per mile (a second-best purchase tax of about $4,000). Other large MSAs can have either positive or negative environmental benefits. New York and Chicago have some of the largest damages from gasoline vehicles, but environmental benefits from electric vehicles are small or negative due to the large damages from electric vehicles. Electric vehicles have substantial environmental benefits in the major Texas MSAs, due to relatively low electric vehicle damages in Texas. However, for nonurban regions as well as for MSAs in the Southeast, Northeast, and Midwest, the benefits from electric vehicles are negative. Table 4 contains a similar analysis at the state level. Compared to MSAs, the environmental benefits of electric vehicles are smaller at the state level because of negative benefits in nonurban areas. The largest environmental benefits are in California (a second-best subsidy of $3,000) and other Western states. The lowest benefits are in the upper Midwest (a second-best tax of almost $5,000 in North Dakota). There are only 11 states in which the environmental benefits are positive, and Texas is the only high VMT state outside the Western interconnection in which the environmental benefits are positive. The top panel of Figure 3 shows the second-best purchase subsidy by state. When driven in the average state, a 2014 electric Ford Focus causes $1,095 more environmental damages over its driving lifetime than the equivalent gasoline Ford Focus. 47",

In contrast, at the upper tail of the distribution, electric vehicle damages were already low, so accounting for native damages has a smaller impact on the environmental benefits.

County-specific taxes on electric miles and gasoline miles set at the Pigovian levels t ei = \u03b4 ei and t gi = \u03b4 gi have zero deadweight loss. To calculate deadweight losses of other policies, we need to specify the share of new vehicle purchases that would be electric under a default policy in which there is no subsidy at all (or business as usual). If the share would be 2 percent, we refer to this as the 2 percent BAU EV share case. We consider 1 percent, 2 percent, and 5 percent shares. Even at a 5 percent share, the electricity used to charge the vehicles is a small percentage of the overall variation in electricity load (see online Appendix M). Given a 2 percent BAU EV share, state-specific taxes have a deadweight loss of $92 million per year, and uniform federal taxes have a deadweight loss of $191 million per year. 52 This implies a gain from differentiation of $100 million (moving from federal to state) and of $191 million (moving from federal to county). The middle and right columns of panel A in Table 6 show differentiated policies in which there is only a single tax on one of the fuels. The second-best single tax is smaller than the Pigovian tax, because consumers can avoid taxation by substituting into the untaxed vehicle (see online Appendix L). For single tax policies, the gains from differentiation are on the order of $25-$200 million. However, the deadweight losses are large particularly for taxes on electric miles only ($1.7 billion). The last three rows of panel A in Table 6 show differentiated taxes based on native damages. The gains from differentiation are small or even negative. These policies lead to large deadweight losses ($0.7-$1.5 billion), because taxes based on native damages are much too low.",

This procedure implies that the replacement plants would be in the same locations and would be dispatched identically to the old coal-fired plants. 55 Turning to the gasoline vehicle fleet, our baseline uses the gasoline Ford Focus as the comparison vehicle to the electric Ford Focus. New regulations on gasoline vehicles will likely lead to lower emissions in the future. For a rough estimate of these effects, we use the Toyota Prius as a proxy for the vehicle of the future. The effect of these changes on the environmental benefits of electric vehicles is given by the \"Future grid and vehicle\" row in Table 7. Damages from both vehicles are lower, and damages from electric vehicles are much lower. However the mean environmental benefits of 0.56 cents per mile implies an electric vehicle subsidy of $840, which is still substantially less than current subsidies.",

In practice, these regulations may impact the market for vehicles and/or the electricity market, and hence have an effect on the environmental benefits of electric vehicles. 58 Some regulations will have a negative effect on the environmental benefits of electric vehicles. Consider the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. CAFE stipulates that the sales-weighted harmonic mean of mpg for a given manufacturer's fleet of vehicles must meet a certain requirement. Electric vehicles are assigned a mpg value for this calculation. These values are much larger than any existing gasoline vehicle. Assuming that the CAFE requirement is initially binding, selling an electric vehicle enables manufacturers to meet a lower standard for the rest of their fleet. Let the CAFE-induced environmental cost of an electric vehicle be defined as the increase in environmental damage from the rest of the fleet when an electric vehicle is sold. In online Appendix N, we determine the CAFE-induced environmental cost and show that the second-best subsidy on the purchase of an electric vehicle is decreased by the amount of the CAFE-induced environmental cost. Applying our baseline values for the Ford Focus, the CAFE-induced environmental cost is $1,555 per vehicle. 59 This value is significant in comparison with even the largest second-best subsidy for an electric vehicle found in our study ($2,785, in California). 56 These include emissions from making vehicles and batteries, extracting oil, refining gasoline, transporting gasoline to retail stations, mining coal and natural gas, and transporting these resources to electric plants.",

In our model of the electricity market, we determine the marginal increase in emissions due to an increase in electricity consumption. We do not model the constraint that power plant emissions are capped. During the period of our analysis, permit prices were exceedingly low in many markets, especially those for SO 2 . In all permit markets, the stock of banked allowances was increasing significantly despite low prices. This suggests that the cap may not have been binding in these markets. 60 Nevertheless, in online Appendix P, we perform calculations to approximate the effect of binding caps. Under the assumption that caps on NO x , SO x , and CO 2 are all binding, damages from an electric vehicle decrease from 2.59 cents per mile to 0.94 cents per mile (with 92 percent of this decrease due to the cap on SO 2 ). Equivalently, the second-best subsidy increases from \u2212$1,095 to $1,380. Turning to RPS, these programs require a fixed percentage of electricity be produced by low emission technologies such as solar and wind. In a region with a RPS, an increase in the electricity load will result in a increase in low emission generation. Therefore, electric vehicle damages can be scaled by 1 \u2212 R , where R is the RPS share, if the renewables operate at the same time and location as EV charging.",

However, in all but 11 states, this purchase makes society as a whole worse off because electric vehicles tend to export air pollution to other states more than gasoline vehicles.
