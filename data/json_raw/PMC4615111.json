While transformed cells largely maintain the competence to recover from a cell cycle arrest, untransformed cells past the G1/S transition lose mitotic inducers, and thus the ability to resume cell division. This permanent cell cycle exit depends on p21, p53, and APC/C Cdh1. However, when and how permanent cell cycle exit occurs remains unclear. Here, we have investigated the cell cycle response to DNA damage in single cells that express Cyclin B1 fused to eYFP at the endogenous locus. We find that upon DNA damage Cyclin B1-eYFP continues to accumulate up to a threshold level, which is reached only in G2 phase. Above this threshold, a p21 and p53-dependent nuclear translocation required for APC/C Cdh1-mediated Cyclin B1-eYFP degradation is initiated. Thus, cell cycle exit is decoupled from activation of the DNA damage response in a manner that correlates to Cyclin B1 levels, suggesting that G2 activities directly feed into the decision for cell cycle exit. Once Cyclin B1-eYFP nuclear translocation occurs, checkpoint inhibition can no longer promote mitotic entry or re-expression of mitotic inducers, suggesting that nuclear translocation of Cyclin B1 marks the restriction point for permanent cell cycle exit in G2 phase.",

            "text": "Preserving the integrity of the genome and preventing cell division in the presence of DNA damage are critical tasks for cell and organism survival. Consequently, eukaryotic cells possess complex networks for surveillance of DNA integrity, checkpoint activation, and DNA repair. Upon a DNA damage insult the DDR kinases ATM, ATR and DNA-PK are activated. Early on, the downstream activated effector kinases MK2, Chk1 and Chk2 mediate a checkpoint response that converges in inactivation of Cdc25s, which results in persistent inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdks. [1][2][3] In addition, the DDR kinases target p53 and Mdm2, resulting in the activation of a p53-dependent transcriptional program including the upregulation of the Cdk inhibitor p21 and the p53-dependent transcriptional repression of cell cycle-promoting factors. 4,5 Together these pathways enforce a checkpoint that allows time for repair and eventual reentry into the cell cycle. However, not all cells recover from a DNA damage arrest, but instead terminally exit the cell cycle.",

            "text": "Terminal cell cycle exit is presumably a mean to prevent propagation of mutations when damage cannot be repaired. In G2 phase it strictly depends on p53-and p21-dependent APC/C Cdh1 activation and subsequent degradation of cell cycle proteins. [6][7][8][9][10][11] A key target for APC/C Cdh1 is Cyclin B1, which in complex with Cdk1 acts as a master regulator of mitotic entry in an unperturbed cell cycle. 12,13 Indeed, we have previously found that upon DNA damage the levels of Cyclin B1 function as a marker for whether G2 cells are still competent to resume cell division. 14 Interestingly, in cancer cell lines with compromised p21 function APC/C-dependent degradation pathways are activated, but cells avoid degradation of Cyclin B1 as well as other mitotic proteins and do not terminally exit the cell cycle. 9,15 Traditionally, DNA damage checkpoint activation and DNA repair were seen as a molecular cascade directly activated downstream of the recognition of DNA damage. Recently however, a growing number of studies indicate that DNA-damage signaling and checkpoint activation have more integrated roles that rely not only on the type of damage, but also on the region in the genome 16 and the cell cycle phase 17 when the damage occurs. However, the timing and coordination of the checkpoint response and terminal cell cycle exit could not be conclusively addressed, as available studies depend largely on population averages and cell synchronization. How single cells decide between checkpoint recovery and terminal cell cycle exit remains currently unclear.",

We first analyzed an ongoing DNA-damage checkpoint response in hTERT-immortalized RPE cells and compared it to transformed U2OS cells. When continuously exposed to low concentration of the topoisomerase II-inhibitor Etoposide, U2OS cells retain expression of G2 specific markers, with the exception of Plk1. 15 In contrast, RPE cells lose the expression of Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, Plk1, Cdk1, and Cdk2, all key regulators of S and G2 phase, indicating a cell cycle exit ( Fig. 1A). 6 We next established a U2OS 18 and an RPE ( Fig. S1A) cell line encoding a Cyclin B1-eYFP fusion protein at the endogenous CCNB1 locus, which allowed us to directly monitor Cyclin B1 protein dynamics in single live cells. We have previously shown that expression levels of Cyclin B1, a key regulator of mitotic entry, correlate closely with the competence to recover from a DNA damage checkpoint. 14 Furthermore, the decrease in Cyclin B1 levels after DNA damage correlates with cellular senescence. 19,20 We monitored Cyclin B1-eYFP levels using time-lapse microscopy ( Fig. 1B) and quantified the total fluorescence of multiple positions after careful subtraction of background fluorescence (materials and methods), allowing a time-resolved readout of Cyclin B1-eYFP levels in a population. At the same time, we monitored a checkpoint arrest by scoring whether cells could enter mitosis. We find that Cyclin B1-eYFP levels increase over a range of Etoposide and NCS concentrations in U2OS cells (Fig. 1C and E). In fact, the increase in Cyclin B1-eYFP levels is more pronounced at Etoposide and NCS concentrations that block mitotic entry. In accordance, FACS analysis shows an accumulation of 4n U2OS cells containing high levels of Cyclin B1 (Fig. 1G). Thus, U2OS cells block in G2 phase without impairing the ability to retain Cyclin B1.",

Moreover, siRNA-mediated depletion of Cdh1, but not of Cdc20, NIPA, or b-TrCP, stabilized Cyclin B1-eYFP after Etoposide addition in a similar way as the APC/C inhibitor proTAME ( Fig. 2B and  C). This indicates that in RPE cells APC/C Cdh1 targets Cyclin B1-eYFP for degradation after DNA damage.",

Whereas Cyclin B1-eYFP stays almost exclusively cytoplasmic in U2OS cells, the majority of RPE cells translocate Cyclin B1-eYFP to the cell nucleus 1 to 2 hours before degradation commences ( Fig. 3A and B). In fact, we found that nuclear translocation of Cyclin B1-eYFP in RPE cells appeared to be highly predictive for the initiation of Cyclin B1-eYFP degradation (Fig. 3C). Nuclear translocation of Cyclin B1-eYFP is not dependent on active APC/C Cdh1 , as addition of MG-132, proTAME, or depletion of Cdh1 rather increased the amount of cells with nuclear Cyclin B1-eYFP. However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 or p21 abolished both nuclear translocation and degradation of Cyclin B1-eYFP ( Fig. 3D). This suggests that although controlled by the same pathways, nuclear translocation of Cyclin B1 is independent of its degradation.",

Indeed, we find that addition of the Exportin 1 inhibitor LMB to Etoposide-treated U2OS cells leads to nuclear accumulation of Cyclin B1-eYFP and subsequent degradation in more than half of the cells (Fig. 3E, G and H). Interestingly, addition of LMB also induced mitotic entry in a subset of cells ( Fig. 3F and H). However, in a small fraction of RPE cells Cyclin B1-eYFP degradation occurred without an apparent nuclear translocation ( Fig. 3C), indicating either that ubiquitination and degradation can also occur in the cytoplasm, or that nuclear translocation is rate-limiting in some cells. We therefore added Importazole, an inhibitor of Importin b to Etoposide-treated cells. 23 Addition of Importazole effectively blocked nuclear translocation, indicating that Cyclin B1 translocation during a DDR depends on active transport by Importin b (Fig. 3I). Strikingly, when tracking single cells most cells did not show signs of Cyclin B1-eYFP degradation and only one cell lost Cyclin B1-eYFP during the time-course of the experiment ( Fig. 3I and J). This indicates that nuclear import is crucial for effective Cyclin B1 degradation after DNA-damage checkpoint activation.",

Furthermore, we never detected recurrence of Cyclin B1-eYFP expression or mitosis when following cells for up to 5 d after damage (Fig. 4A). Moreover, whereas the G2 population of U2OS cells retains both Cyclin B1-eYFP and checkpoint recovery competence, RPE cells lose Cyclin B1-eYFP over time and do not enter mitosis after combined treatment with the checkpoint kinase inhibitors KU60019 and UCN-01 once Cyclin B1-eYFP is degraded (Fig. 4B).

Addition of caffeine shortly after damage stimulated mitotic entry and sustained Cyclin B1-eYFP expression over time. In contrast, caffeine had limited effect on both Cyclin B1-eYFP levels and forced mitotic entry when added 6 hours after Etoposide ( Fig. 4C and D). When analyzing single cells we found that addition of caffeine 1 hour after Etoposide had a dramatic effect on both mitotic entry and timing of Cyclin B1-eYFP degradation, showing that ATM/ATR activity initiates these events ( Fig. 4E). However, when added 4 or 6 hours after Etoposide, at a time when nuclear translocation of Cyclin B1-eYFP had occurred in most cells, forced mitotic entry was only apparent in cells where no signs of nuclear translocation or degradation of Cyclin B1-eYFP were present ( Fig. 4E and F). Moreover, we never observed mitotic entry for cells that had already translocated Cyclin B1-eYFP to the nucleus at the time of caffeine addition ( Fig. 4G).",

As Cyclin B1-eYFP levels are a direct readout of cell cycle progression, we grew cells on fibronectin-coated micropatterns, which enabled us to accurately quantify fluorescence in single U2OS or RPE cells over long periods of time. 18 Whereas on Western blot, U2OS cells reach a steady state of Cyclin B1 after DNA damage, Cyclin B1-eYFP levels vary dramatically over time in individual cells ( Fig. 5B and C). In fact, a majority of U2OS cells continuously increase Cyclin B1-eYFP to protein levels that are higher compared to what is observed during unperturbed growth. Similar to U2OS cells, no RPE cell sustains a steady-state of Cyclin B1-eYFP over time (Fig. 5C). After an initial increase, RPE cells degrade Cyclin B1-eYFP over a 15-hour time-period. Interestingly, the time point of degradation  correlates with the Cyclin B1-eYFP level at the time point of the DNA damage insult, that is cells with high Cyclin B1-eYFP level initiate degradation earlier than cells with low Cyclin B1-eYFP level (Fig. 5D). As a consequence, Cyclin B1-eYFP levels are prevented from exceeding the levels observed during mitotic entry. Thus, Cyclin B1-eYFP degradation is temporally decoupled from initiation of the DDR in a manner that correlates with the initial levels of Cyclin B1-eYFP, indicating a cell cycle-dependent control of Cyclin B1 degradation.",

When synchronizing unperturbed cells in mitosis, both RPE and U2OS cells showed similar dynamics and similar levels of Cyclin B1-eYFP (Fig. 5E). However, in U2OS cells Cyclin B1-eYFP accumulation starts earlier and with larger variability between individual cells (Fig. 5E), and we note that nuclear translocation of Cyclin B1-eYFP is less apparent compared to RPE cells both in unperturbed and DNA damage conditions ( Fig. 5F and G). We next focused on cells with a low level of Cyclin B1-eYFP at the time of Etoposide addition. U2OS cells required approximately 30 hours before reaching similar Cyclin B1-eYFP level as during unperturbed mitotic entry, suggesting that Cyclin B1 accumulation is slower after initiation of a DDR (Fig. 5H). When synchronizing RPE cells with initially low levels of Cyclin B1-eYFP at their maximal level of fluorescence, we note that degradation is initiated at similar Cyclin B1-eYFP levels in all cells (Fig. 5H). Thus, indicating that in RPE cells Cyclin B1 is allowed to accumulate up to a distinct threshold before degradation is initiated. As this threshold corresponds to Cyclin B1 levels at the S/G2 transition in unperturbed growth (Fig. 5E and H) we reasoned that Cyclin B1 degradation is initiated when cells exit S phase. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the cell cycle timing of Cyclin B1 nuclear translocation during DNA damage by sorting single RPE cells according to their DNA content and determined Cyclin B1 localization by immunofluorescence. Strikingly, we find that Cyclin B1 nuclear localization occurs only in cells in G2 phase (Fig. 5I). Thus, Cyclin B1 accumulation continues after DNA damage and Cyclin B1 nuclear translocation and subsequent degradation is only initiated when Cyclin B1 has reached a distinct threshold level in G2 phase.",

By examining Cyclin B1 dynamics in single RPE cells we show that APC/ C Cdh1 activation is temporally decoupled from the DNA damage insult. While at a population level Cyclin B1 expression remains stable during the first hours after DNA damage, we find that no single cell maintains steady Cyclin B1 levels over time. Rather Cyclin B1 levels continue to rise and degradation is only initiated once a certain threshold is reached. Cells containing very low levels of Cyclin B1-eYFP initially accumulate it to levels indicative of entering G2 phase. At the same time, only cells with 4n DNA content initiate Cyclin B1 degradation, showing that terminal cell cycle exit occurs in G2 phase, but not in S phase.",

Several studies show that this permanent cell cycle exit depends on APC/C Cdh1 activation. [6][7][8][9] Indeed, chicken DT40 Cdh1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells fail to maintain a DNA damage-induced G2 arrest. 24 However, we find that the actual point-of-noreturn occurs already earlier. Once all damaged DNA is repaired, the upstream ATM and ATR kinases lose their activating stimuli, which will lead to their eventual inactivation. We show that simulating repair by blocking ATM/ATR activity can induce recovery only in cells that had not previously translocated Cyclin B1 to the cell nucleus. Thus, after Cyclin B1 nuclear translocation, cell cycle exit is no longer dependent on the presence of DNA damage signaling. As a consequence, depending on its initial cell cycle state, a cell has a set time to repair damaged DNA, before Cyclin B1 nuclear translocation in G2 phase marks the restriction point for terminal cell cycle exit.",

In fact, transformed cells exclude Cyclin B1 from the nucleus 26 and accumulate it to high levels during ongoing DNA damage. 27 Under these conditions forced nuclear translocation of Cyclin B1 actually induces checkpoint override or Cyclin B1 degradation. 8 Notably, this data highlights an intriguing analogy to the unperturbed cell cycle, where Cyclin B1 nuclear translocation leads to a restriction point for mitotic entry.

Once a certain threshold level is reached in G2 phase Cyclin B1 nuclear translocation occurs and cell fate becomes determined toward permanent cell cycle exit.",

The targeting construct was designed to contain 959 bp of homology with the CCNB1 locus in the 5 0 of the STOP codon and 1253 bp 3 0 of the STOP codon. The construct was cloned into a rAAV backbone and the resulting clones were verified by test digest prior to transfection of HEK293T cells to produce viral particles. Transduced and control U2OS and RPE cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA 96 h after transduction, washed, resuspended in PBS, and filtered through a cell strainer to avoid cell aggregates (BD Falcon). Positive clones were obtained by sorting cells in a FACSAria III (Becton Dickinson) sorter as described previously by Mata and colleagues. 32 Flow cytometry Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, resuspended and fixed with 70% ethanol.
