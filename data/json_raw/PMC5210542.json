            "text": "R-loopDB (http://rloop.bii.a-star.edu.sg) was originally constructed as a collection of computationally predicted R-loop forming sequences (RLFSs) in the human genic regions. The renewed R-loopDB provides updates, improvements and new options, including access to recent experimental data. It includes genome-scale prediction of RLFSs for humans, six other animals and yeast. Using the extended quantitative model of RLFSs (QmRLFS), we significantly increased the number of RLFSs predicted in the human genes and identified RLFSs in other organism genomes. R-loopDB allows searching of RLFSs in the genes and in the 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking sequences of any gene. R-loopDB exploits the Ensembl gene annotation system, providing users with chromosome coordinates, sequences, gene and genomic data of the 1 565 795 RLFSs distributed in 121 056 genic or proximal gene regions of the covered organisms. It provides a comprehensive annotation of Ensembl RLFS-positive genes including 93 454 protein coding genes, 12 480 long non-coding RNA and 7 568 small non-coding RNA genes and 7 554 pseudogenes. Using new interface and genome viewers of R-loopDB, users can search the gene(s) in multiple species with keywords in a single query. R-loopDB provides tools to carry out comparative evolution and genome-scale analyses in R-loop biology.",

R-loops are often formed during transcription. Both in vitro and in vivo, a few short guanine clusters and further G-rich DNA segment in non-template DNA strand, as well as its sequence length, can provide important determinants of the initiation of R-loop formation and its stabilization (1)(2)(3)(4). R-loop formation has been observed from bacteria to mammalian species (5,6). In cells these structures have long been considered to result from rare or accidental RNA with DNA hybrids detected in a few specific loci. However, their functional importance was poor understood.",

R-loop models collected in R-loopDB had a number of important features, including genic strand RLFS directionality, CpG island abundance, preferential location of the RLFSs in the open chromatin and highly regulated genic regions (e.g. in the vicinity of alternative transcription start sites, RNA polymerase II pause sites, splicing regions, the first exon and first intron), activationinduced cytidine deaminase target sequences, fragile regions and disease critical loci (18). In silico analysis of the human genome identified a high number of RLFS (245 181) in 59% well-annotated genes (18). Consistent with these D120 Nucleic Acids Research, 2017, Vol. 45, Database issue predictions, several recent genome-wide experimental studies mapped thousands of RNA:DNA hybridization signals distributed along human and mouse genomes and demonstrated that R-loops can be formed not only in the gene body but also in the upstream promoter regions (9-11) and transcription pause sites located downstream of the poly(A) signal (9,10,12,13,19). Formation of these R-loops in proximal promoter regions was shown to be involved in transcription initiation or elongation (9) and the recruitment of key pluripotency regulators (11). R-loops forming in transcription termination sites could promote termination by slowing down the advance of the RNA polymerase II and allowing the recruitment of termination factors (13). Interestingly, such co-localization of R-loops with key regulatory regions was not limited to humans but also found or predicted in many other species (7,20,21).",

We updated the identification of RLFSs in the human genome and provided for the first time the genome-scale prediction of RLFSs in seven additional organisms. The updated R-loopDB allows the user to search for gene(s) containing RLFSs not only in genic regions but also in 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking sequence of the gene, termed 'RLFS-positive genes'. Compared to the previous R-loopDB version, we now use Ensembl gene annotation system that contains information on protein coding genes, pseudogenes, long noncoding RNA genes and short noncoding RNA genes (25). Mapping of RLFSs and other genomic regulatory sequences is graphically visualized in Gbrowse2 (26) and UCSC genome browser (27). In the case of the human and mouse genomes, the experimentally detected RNA:DNA hybrid data (9,12,14,24) on the genome scale were integrated into the genomics viewers. That allows users to carry out comprehensive compar-ative analyses of the predicted and experimentally detected RLFSs. Based on the provided results, users can narrow down their target and pick the most plausible sequence of the R-loop forming region.",

            "text": "The 'Gene Overview' provides detailed information of the Ensembl gene ( Figure 1C.i) and RLFS-merged regions within proximal gene regions ( Figure 1C.ii). Here, NEAT1 gene encodes a nuclear long non-coding RNA. According to its annotation, NEAT1 RNA is essential for the formation and maintenance of nuclear structures called paraspeckles and is involved in cell malignancy. The gene information panel ( Figure 1C.i) shows the gene annotation of a given Ensembl gene ID retrieved from the BioMart database (build 75), i.e. gene description, gene biotype, chromosome location, Ensembl transcript ID, Entrez ID and RefSeq ID, while gene synonyms were retrieved from the Ensembl database (build 84). In RLFS-merged region information ( Figure 1C.ii; also see Figure 2a), this table provides a list of RLFS-merged regions located in the genic region and 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking regions of the particular gene. Each RLFS-merged region has useful information for supporting the R-loop forming potential, such as (i) the number of RLFSs, and (ii) strand and (iii) statistics of the GC skew value. To find RLFS candidates for experimental validation, we recommend that users consider the information in the RLFS-merged region table ( Figure 1C.ii). The first one is the 'number of RLFSs'. A higher number of RLFSs in the RLFS-merged region implies a higher propensity of R-loop initiation and formation in a given locus. The second one is 'strand'. According to the R-loop definition where a nascent RNA is hybridized with a DNA template, predicted RLFS are located on the same strand as the transcribed gene ( Supplementary Figure S1). The third one is 'statistics of GC skew value'. GC skew value was calculated at the whole genomic scale, as shown in Figure 2c. The 'statistics of GC skew value' show statistics of GC skew value in each RLFS-merged region including minimum, maximum, mean and median. GC skew maximum values > 0.1 (for plus strand) or GC skew minimum values < \u22120.1 (for minus strand) are considered Grich regions (21). The more G-rich an RLFS-merged region is, the more likely it is to increase the thermodynamic stability of R-loop formation (24). In the case of the human and mouse genomes, 'DRIP/RDIP support' and 'DRIPc support' columns, which indicate the number of RNA:DNA hybrid detection experiments for each RLFS-merged region, are provided. There are at least nine RNA:DNA hybrid detection experiments including four DRIP-seq studies in Ntera2, one DRIP-seq in K562, one DRIP-seq in primary fibroblast cells (9,12,14), two RDIP-seq studies in IMR-90 and HEK293T cells (24) and one DRIPc-seq in Ntera2. Individually, these experiments showed variations in the sequence overlap region boundaries, their locations and the sequence cluster overlap peak heights, however, collectively they often demonstrate the patterns converged on the theoretical predictions. A combination of computational predictions and biological data sets suggests a role of NEAT1-associated R-loops in an aberrant NEAT1 transcription initiation and/or 3-end elongation isoform syntheses, leading to modulation of the paraspeckle formation and cell malignancy.",

According to the updated R-loopDB, the upstream and downstream proximal gene regions are highly enriched with unique RLFSs, the boundaries of which can either overlap or not overlap with gene starts (or transcription start sites), gene body and the gene ends. Such data could provide the targets for detailed characterization in future experimental studies. The Venn diagrams of Supplementary Figure S4A and S4B shows these values for the RLFS overlapped with the human genes and transcripts, respectively.  Figure S5A). For illustration purposes, glycine dehydrogenase (GLDC) gene was used as a query. GLDC protein is a member of the multiple-enzyme glycine cleavage system involved in the degradation of glycine. The deletion in GLDC is a major cause of nonketotic hyperglycinemia, an inborn error of metabolism characterized by the accumulation of glycine in body fluids and various neurological symptoms (29). In the previous paper, we have shown that RLFSs are located at the deleted regions of the human GLDC and may contribute to recombination of this gene (18). In this work, the updated R-loopDB result page shows that five of the eight organisms, including human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat and chicken, contain at least one RLFS in GLDC gene. Supplementary Figure S5B shows the search result of GLDC containing RLFS in five analyzed organisms. Figure 3 illustrates the relative RLFS positions in GLDC gene of the organisms. Interestingly, RLFSs have relative positions within the first exon of GLDC gene between all five organisms (green color box in Figure 3). In addition, there are several other RLFSs showing relative positions within an intron of the GLDC gene, which may characterize the commonness and uniqueness of the human and chimpanzee intron sequences (blue color boxes in Figure 3). These RLFS clusters (in blue color boxes in Figure 3) are not computationally identified in other (non-primate) organisms. This example allows users to investigate several hypotheses regarding the functional roles of the sequence structure and genome location of the predicted RLFSs. Many aspects of comparative evolution and evolutional conservation of RLFSs and the disease-associated functions of the R-loops in GLDC and other genic regions annotated in the R-loopDB may be investigated using the R-loopDB.",
