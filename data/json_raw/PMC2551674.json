Altered endogenous glucocorticoid metabolism, including 11\u2424-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u2424-HSD1), which generates active cortisol from cortisone, and 5\u2423-reductase (5\u2423R), which inactivates cortisol, has been implicated. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-A total of 101 obese patients (mean age 48 \u03ee 7 years, BMI 34.4 \u03ee 4.3 kg/m 2 , 66 women, 35 men) underwent 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), body composition analysis (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), assessment of glucocorticoid metabolism (24-h urine steroid metabolite analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies. RESULTS-A total of 22.7% of women had IGT compared with 34.2% of men. Two women and five men were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. In women, adipose 11\u2424-HSD1 expression was increased in patients with IGT and correlated with glucose levels across the OGTT (R \u03ed 0.44, P \u03fd 0.001) but was independent of fat mass. Total glucocorticoid secretion was higher in men with and without IGT (normal 13,743 \u03ee 863 vs. 7,453 \u03ee 469 g/24 h,"

            "text": "espite the severe health consequences of obesity (1) and the alarming rate at which its prevalence is increasing (2), many questions remain unanswered with regard to its pathogenesis and etiology. Insulin resistance and obesity are tightly associated, yet the molecular mechanisms that underpin this relationship are unknown. Insulin resistance has been implicated as central not only to the development of obesity itself but also its complications, including dyslipidemia, thromboembolic disease, and hypertension (3). Furthermore, it is a feature of many other clinical conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where the degree of insulin resistance exceeds that observed in body composition-matched control subjects (4). The association between insulin resistance and obesity almost certainly explains the dramatic relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes (5,6). Type 2 diabetes evolves from a state of insulin resistance with hyperinsulinema necessary to maintain glucose tolerance. Type 2 diabetes is manifest when insulin secretion fails to meet demands, with consequent hyperglycemia and eventual pancreatic \u2424-cell failure. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), defined as a 2-h glucose concentration \u03fe7.8 mmol/l but \u03fd11.1 mmol/l after 75-g oral glucose testing (OGTT), significantly increases the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes (7), and although rates of progression to type 2 diabetes are variable, they may exceed 10% per year (8,9). Although the benefits of lifestyle intervention are clear (9), the molecular mechanisms that cause IGT and, similarly, the mechanisms by which IGT progresses to type 2 diabetes are largely unknown.",

            "text": "The role of endogenous glucocorticoids in the development of obesity and insulin resistance has been widely speculated on based upon observation in patients with glucocorticoid excess (Cushing's syndrome). These patients develop a classical phenotype including central obesity, insulin resistance, and in some cases type 2 diabetes. However, simple obesity and insulin resistance are not caused by subclinical endogenous glucocorticoid excess; circulating cortisol levels in obese patients are not elevated (10). Tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism, however, may be important. The enzyme 11\u2424-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u2424-HSD1) is highly expressed in liver, adipose tissue, and muscle and generates the active glucocorticoid cortisol from inactive cortisone and therefore amplifies local glucocorticoid action (11). However, 11\u2424-HSD1 is a bidirectional enzyme and is capable of inactivating cortisol to cortisone. Critically, the directionality of 11\u2424-HSD1 activity is cofactor (NADPH) dependent, which is supplied by a tightly associated endolumenal enzyme, hexose-6-phopshate dehydrogenase (H6PDH). Decreases in H6PDH expression and activity decrease oxoreductase and increase dehydrogenase activity (12,13). Recently, much attention has focused on pharmacological manipulation of cortisol metabolism as a therapeutic strategy. Selective 11\u2424-HSD1 inhibitors administered to rodents and primates decrease local glucocorticoid generation, improve glucose tolerance, increase insulin sensitivity, and may promote weight loss (14 -17). In contrast to the action of 11\u2424-HSD1, the A-ring reductases (5\u2423-reductase type 1 [5\u2423R1] and type 2 [5\u2423R2] and 5\u2424-reductase) inactivate cortisol, decreasing local glucocorticoid availability to bind and activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). 5\u2423R1 is expressed in skin and adipose tissue (18,19) and 5\u2423R2 in prostate, epididymis, and seminal vesicles; both isozymes are expressed in the liver (18).",

We have hypothesized that decreased local glucocorticoid availability (through decreased 11\u2424-HSD1 and/or increased A-ring reductase activity) will represent a novel physiological adaptive response to preserve insulin sensitivity in a cohort of patients predisposed to the development of insulin resistance, IGT, and type 2 diabetes."

Body composition analysis was performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) with a total body scanner (QDR 45OO; Hologic, Bedford, MA). Coefficients of variation (CVs) for multiple scans were \u03fd3%. Regional fat mass (trunk and leg) was analyzed as previously described (21). Biochemical assays. Blood counts, urea, creatinine and electrolytes, cholesterol, triglycerides, liver chemistry, glucose, and A1C were measured using standard laboratory methods (Roche Modular system; Roche, Lewes, U.K.). Insulin was measured using a commercially available colorimetric ELISA (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden) with an in-house CV of \u03fd5%. Cortisol was measured using a coat-a-count radioimmunoassay (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA) as per the manufacturer's guidelines. Cortisone was assayed after extraction from serum followed by radioimmunoassay of the extract with 125 I-cortisone and Sac-Cel (IDS, Tyne and Weir, U.K.) second antibody separation (22). The CV for 10 consecutive assays was \u03fd15% for values between 50 and 100 nmol/l and \u03fd10% for values over 100 nmol/l. Calculated measures of pancreatic \u2424-cell function and insulin resistance were made using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) 2 model (23). The HOMA of \u2424-cell function (HOMA %B) values provide an index of pancreatic islet \u2424-cell function relative to a normal individual with a value set at 100%. Similarly, HOMA of insulin sensitivity (HOMA %S) values represent a measure of insulin sensitivity relative to a normal individual, again with a value of 100%. The HOMA of insulin resistance is a reciprocal measure of the %S values. Urinary corticosteroid metabolites. Urinary corticosteroid metabolite analysis was performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as described previously (20). The sum of total cortisol metabolites (tetrahydrocortisol [THF ], tetrahydrocortisone [THE], 5\u2423-THF, \u2423-cortolone, cortisone [E], cortisol [F], \u2424-cortolone, \u2424-cortol, and \u2423-cortol) provides a reflection of cortisol secretion rate. The ratio of tetrahydrometabolites of cortisol (THF \u03e9 5\u2423THF) to those of cortisone (THE) provides a reflection of 11\u2424-HSD1 activity when considered with the ratio of urinary free cortisol to cortisone, which more accurately reflects renal 11\u2424-HSD2 activity (20). The ratios of cortols to cortolones and of 11\u2424-hydroxy-etiocholanolone and 11\u2424-hydroxy-androsterone combined to 11oxo-etiocholanolone also reflect 11\u2424-HSD1 activity (24). The activities of 5\u2423-and 5\u2424-reductases can be inferred from measuring the ratio of 5\u2423 THF to THF and androsterone to etiocholanolone. RNA extraction and reverse transcription. Following subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy, total RNA was extracted using a single-step extraction method (Magmax 96; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as per the manufacturer's guidelines. RNA integrity and quantity were assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Wilmington, DE).",

Regression analyses. Univariate regression analysis revealed positive relationships between 5\u2423R activity (as measured by both the urinary androsterone-to-etiocholanolone and 5\u2423THF-to-THF ratios) and markers of insulin resistance. In women, significant correlations were observed with fasting insulin, 2-h insulin levels after 75 g oral glucose, AUC insulin across the OGTT, and HOMA-R (Table 3 and Fig. 2A-D). In men, a similar pattern was observed (Table 3; Fig. 2A-D), but in addition, increased 5\u2423R activity was associated with decreased pancreatic \u2424-cell function as calculated from the HOMA-%B ( Table 3). Activity of 5\u2423R increased with increasing total and regional fat and fat-free mass in men but not in women (Table 3). While these relationships remained significant, they were weaker than those observed with markers of insulin resistance.

Previous studies have examined 11\u2424-HSD1 mRNA expression and activity in adipose tissue in the context of fat mass with variable results. Within the subcutaneous depot, most studies, although not all, have suggested increased expression with indexes of obesity (25)(26)(27)(28)(29), but relative expression within the intra-abdominal depot remains controversial. Importantly, the expression of 11\u2424-HSD1 in adipose tissue and its relationship with insulin resistance and glucose tolerance has not been examined before. While expression studies were only performed in subcutaneous adipose tissue, enhanced cortisol generation through increased 11\u2424-HSD1 mRNA expression may contribute to glucose intolerance through increased lipolysis (30,31) and generation of free fatty acids, which impair peripheral glucose uptake (32). However, due to the small volumes of tissue obtained, activity studies were not performed and it is possible that decreased H6PDH expression that we also observed in the IGT group may decrease 11\u2424-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity by limiting cofactor supply. Sexually dimorphic activity and expression of 11\u2424-HSD1 has been described in some studies (33) but not all (34). In our cohort, urinary GC/MS analysis was similar in men and women. Studies examining sex-specific regulation of expression within adipose tissue are lacking. In nonadipose tissue, estradiol has been shown to regulate expression levels, and it is possible that this may contribute to our observations; however, the published data are often contradictory with studies showing both increased and decreased expression (35)(36)(37)(38). With the exception of dehydroepiandrosterone (39), there is little evidence to support a role for regulation by androgens (35,38). Sexually dimorphic expression of H6PDH has not been described previously, and the observed increase in expression in men will need to be endorsed with dedicated activity studies to see if changes in H6PDH expression translate into alterations in glucocorticoid availability. However, it is possible that this could contribute to differences in fat distribution between men and women, with the consequent increase in cardiovascular risk (40).",

            "text": "In our study, in both sexes, 5\u2423R activity as measured by urinary glucocorticoid metabolite ratios increased with indexes of insulin resistance, an observation that was independent of fat mass. The role of 5\u2423R in the control of body composition and insulin sensitivity has not been explored in detail in the published literature. The global measures of activity that we have used in this study do not allow us to distinguish between 5\u2423R1 and 5\u2423R2, and whereas patients with 5\u2423R2 mutations have clear evidence of abnormal hepatic cortisol metabolism (41), the contribution of 5\u2423R1 is yet to be clarified. Sexual dimorphism of 5\u2423R activity has been described with increased activity in male subjects (10,34). In our study, absolute levels of 5\u2423and 5\u2424-reduced metabolites were higher in men (as was total glucocorticoid production rate), but the relative balance of 5\u2423R and 5\u2424R activity was not different. Furthermore, 5\u2423R1 mRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue was similar in men and women. Studies in small cohorts of patients have shown enhanced 5\u2423R activity with obesity (42) and type 2 diabetes (43) and regulation of 5\u2423R and 5\u2424R activity by dietary macronutrient composition; high-fat, low-carbohydrate and moderate-fat, moderate-carbohydrate diets decrease 5\u2423R and 5\u2424R activity in the context of weight loss (44). Thiazolidinedione treatment of obese Z\u00fc cker rats decreases 5\u2423R1 expression in the liver (45), but similar experiments in humans have not been performed. However, we have recently shown that following weight loss with consequent insulin sensitization, 5\u2423R activity decreased (46). 5\u2423R has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the insulin resistance associated with PCOS, in that patients with PCOS are more insulin resistant compared with body composition-matched control subjects (4) and have increased 5\u2423R activity (47). Moreover, within a cohort of patients with PCOS, 5\u2423R activity correlates with insulin resistance (48). Our findings are consistent with these data and extend this observation to healthy obese women and men, as well as demonstrate that the relationship (in both sexes) is independent of fat mass. In the context of insulin resistance, we postulate that increased 5\u2423R activity represents a compensatory mechanism to decrease local glucocorticoid availability and occurs in conjunction with the decrease in 11\u2424-HSD1 activity (as evidenced by reduced cortisol generation following oral cortisone administration and decreased urinary 5\u2423-\u03e9 THF-to-THE ratios) that we and others have previously described in obesity (22,26). These processes act together (decreased generation of cortisol through a reduction in 11\u2424-HSD1 and increased inactivation of cortisol through enhanced 5\u2423R activity) to decrease local glucocorticoid availability and decrease GR activation specifically within the liver, with the aim of maintenance of hepatic insulin sensitivity. A further impact of these changes will be to drive the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in order to maintain circulating cortisol levels. While we believe that the changes that we have observed largely reflect hepatic glucocorticoid metabolism, a direct effect upon insulin secretion cannot be excluded. However, this remains highly speculative, bearing in mind that evidence of A-ring reductase expression in human pancreatic islets is lacking. Pharmacological manipulation of glucocorticoid availability through prereceptor metabolism adds credence to our observations. Selective 11\u2424-HSD1 inhibitors that decrease local glucocorticoid availability remain an exciting therapeutic prospect. Significant improvements in insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and lipid profiles following short-term administration in rodents and primates have been observed. Human clinical studies are still eagerly awaited. Conversely, Finasteride (5\u2423R2 inhibitor) and Dutasteride (combined 5\u2423R1 and 5\u2423R2 inhibitor) are widely used in the treatment of prostatic hypertrophy (49) based upon their action upon androgen metabolism. However, by decreasing glucocorticoid inactivation, they may have a detrimental impact upon insulin sensitivity, but the studies to address this question have not been performed.",

While little is currently known about the regulation of 5\u2423R activity, limiting local glucocorticoid availability through enhanced 5\u2423R and/or inhibition of 11\u2424-HSD1 activity may have significant clinical benefits. Finally, prospective studies examining the changes in activity and expression of these enzymes over time may begin to shed light on their potential role in the development of IGT and type 2 diabetes.
