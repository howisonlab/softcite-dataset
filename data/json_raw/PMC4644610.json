Objectives: This study aimed to audit nursing care based on a nursing process model. Patients and Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study in which a nursing audit checklist was designed and validated for assessing nurses' compliance with nursing process. A total of 300 nurses from various clinical settings of Tehran university of medical sciences were selected. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, including frequencies, Pearson correlation coefficient and independent samples t-tests. Results: The compliance rate of nursing process indicators was 79.71 \u00b1 0.87. Mean compliance scores did not significantly differ by education level and gender. However, overall compliance scores were correlated with nurses' age (r = 0.26, P = 0.001) and work experience (r = 0.273, P = 0.001). Conclusions: Nursing process indicators can be used to audit nursing care. Such audits can be used as quality assurance tools.",

It not only improves care quality but also helps nurses to acquire and use the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for creating a meaningful, productive, and satisfying working environment (2). The first step in operationalizing the clinical audit is to identify specified indicators of the domain. The nursing process can be used as a framework for developing auditing indicators.",

Two auditors, who were trained in auditing, performed the audit by using a guide designed before the audit process was started. To determine the rate of compliance with indicators, all of the nursing activities were observed during a single work shift and nursing documents were evaluated. Furthermore, in some cases, interviews were conducted with nurses as explained in detail in the audit guide. Nurses' performance was assessed using the audit checklist during a single work shift. Some indicators needed to be assessed through a review of documents and nursing notes (e.g., recording and reporting). Some indicators had to be assessed through observation (e.g., collaborating with the client/family in decision making for clinical practice). A few indicators were assessed through interviews of patients and their families (e.g., education about the home care plan).",

This is somewhat consistent with a previous study by Sorensen, where assessment and care planning were introduced as the main indicators of healthcare system accreditation (3). However, Adib-Hajbaghery and Safa investigated nurses' evaluation of their use and mastery of health assessment skills and reported that nurses use these skills below the desired level (14). Nurses' adherence to the nursing process differs across settings. Although the nursing culture differs across hospitals, previous findings may have been influenced by managerial factors or the instruments used. However, Munroe et al. found that using a framework for assessment by nurses improved clinical practice and patient care outcomes (4).",

This suggests that nurses with more clinical experience are more likely to use the nursing process model to provide care and are more committed to it. This differs from Perez Rivas et al.'s findings that younger nurses had better adherence to the nursing process than older nurses did (12). In contrast, Akbari Kaji found that neither age nor experience was significantly associated with commitment to the nursing process (13). We did not find a significant association between level of education and compliance with the nursing process. This is consistent with the findings of Rivas et al. and Akbari Kaji (12,13).",
