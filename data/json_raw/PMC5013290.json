            "text": "Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the major pathogen of tuberculosis, which affects approximately one-third of the world's population. The 6 kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT6) and the 10 kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP10), which are secreted by the ESX-1 system in M. tuberculosis, can contribute to mycobacterial virulence. Objectives: The aim of this study was to research the effects of M. tuberculosis ESAT6-CFP10 protein on macrophages during a host's was first and second exposures to M. tuberculosis. Materials and Methods: In this study, the ESAT6 and CFP10 genes were amplified to create a fusion gene (ESAT6-CFP10) and cloned into the pET-32a(+) and pEGFP-N1 expression vectors, respectively. The recombinant pET-32a(+)-ESAT6-CFP10 plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli Origami strain, and the fusion protein was expressed and confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The recombinant pEGFP-N1-ESAT6-CFP10 plasmid was transfected into rat alveolar macrophage cells (NR8383). The cell line expressing the ESAT6-CFP10 protein was selected with RT-PCR and designated as NR8383-EC. Finally, the effects of the ESAT6-CFP10 fusion protein on the NR8383 cell line, as well as on the newly constructed NR8383-EC cells, were further assessed. Results: The recombinant ESAT6-CFP10 protein was expressed in E. coli and in NR8383 rat alveolar macrophages. This protein affected the proliferation and nitric oxide (NO) generation of the NR8383 and NR8383-EC cells. Although NO generation was inhibited in both cell lines, proliferation was inhibited in NR8383 while it was increased NR8383-EC. Conclusions: The data indicate that ESAT6-CFP10 could support the survival of M. tuberculosis in the host through altering the host immune response. It also indicates that the host may gain some level of protection from a second exposure to M. tuberculosis, as evidenced by increased proliferation of NR8383-EC.",

            "text": "Previous research showed that vaccines constructed based on ESAT6 and CFP10 could reduce the M. tuberculosis burden in guinea pigs and non-human primates (2,3). However, substantial evidence indicates that ESAT6 and CFP10 are also virulence factors. The Rv3875 gene that encodes ESAT6 is located within the region of difference 1 (RD1), which is present in all pathogenic mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, but not in attenuated M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Gue'rin (BCG) (4). ESAT6 and CFP10 are secreted as 1:1 dimers through a specific secretion system, ESX-1 (5)(6)(7). Studies of M. bovis BCG and RD1complemented M. bovis BCG have demonstrated that the secretion of ESAT6 and CFP10 are required for the virulence, pathogenicity, and growth of M. bovis in macrophages and in mice (8,9). In addition, ESAT6 and CFP10 are produced in the lungs of infected mice (10). The mechanisms by which ESAT6 and CFP10 contribute to virulence are not fully defined, but are believed to be involved in the cytolysis of alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages (11), favoring the intercellular spread of M. tuberculosis (12). centrations killed more than 99% of the bacteria in culture (16), indicating that NO may induce macrophage apoptosis. In a TB-infection murine model, NO played an essential role in the mononuclear phagocyte killing of M. tuberculosis (17).",

M. tuberculosis is a typical intracellular pathogen that resides within the host macrophages and dendritic cells. Invasion of macrophages by M. tuberculosis is a critical step in the establishment of tuberculosis (TB) infections. Macrophage apoptosis is a host defense mechanism against M. tuberculosis infection (18,19). On the other hand, M. tuberculosis could survive in the host macrophages by inhibiting their apoptosis. Some researchers have indicated that avirulent mycobacterial species, such as the attenuated M. bovis BCG, cause considerably higher rates of macrophage apoptosis than do the virulent M. tuberculosis species (20). Comparative analyses of the genomic sequences of M. tuberculosis (21) and M. bovis (22) with that of the attenuated M. bovis BCG strain have identified a number of proteins deleted in BCG. These include the small secreted ESAT6 and CFP10, which are known to contribute to microbial virulence. Therefore, the effects of ESAT6 and CFP10 on macrophage apoptosis are very important for studying and understanding the mechanisms of tuberculosis.",

This was evidenced by differences in proliferation between the NR8383-EC cell line, which carried the ESAT6-CFP10 fusion protein, and NR8383, which did not.
