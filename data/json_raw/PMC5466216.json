            "text": "The retrospective study aimed to investigate the indication for hypertrophy posterior longitudinal ligament (HPLL) removal in anterior decompression for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). A total of 138 consecutive patients with CSM were divided into 2 groups with developmental cervical stenosis (DCS) (group S) and non-DCS (group N), according to the Pavlov ratio. These 2 groups were subdivided into 2 further subgroups, according to whether HPLL was removed or preserved: group SR (49 patients) and group SP (32 patients) in group S, group NR (21 patients) and group NP (36 patients) in group N. The modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score (mJOA), the modified recovery rate (mRR), quality of life (QoL), and relevant clinical data were used for clinical and radiological evaluation. The mJOA scores improved from 7.3 \u00b1 2.2 to 15.0 \u00b1 1.8 in the SR group and from 7.9 \u00b1 2.3 to 14.2 \u00b1 1.5 in the SP group (P = .036), with postoperative QoL significantly higher in the SR group than the SP group. A reduction in the diameter of enlarged spinal canals occurred at a significantly faster rate in the SP group compared with the SR group (P = .002). Multivariate regression analyses showed removal of HPLL correlated with mJOA scores (coefficient = 7.337, P = .002), mRR (%) (coefficient = 9.117, P = .005), PCS (coefficient = 12.129, P < .001), and MCS (coefficient = 14.31, P < .001) in the S group at 24 months postoperatively, while removal of HPLL did not correlate with clinical outcomes in the N group. The HPLL should, therefore, be removed when mobility was reduced and the spinal cord remained compressed after anterior decompression procedures in the patients with DCS. However, in non-DCS patients, it remains unclear as to whether removal of HPLL provides any clinical benefit, thus, HPLL removal may not be necessary.

            "text": "Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), described by Cloward in 1958, [1] is the most commonly utilized technique for the treatment of compressive cervical myelo-radiculopathy. Since the initial application of this procedure, ACDF has been increasingly applied for the treatment of cervical spinal disorders following improvements in surgical techniques and instrumentation. However, controversy still exists as to whether hypertrophy posterior longitudinal ligaments (HPLLs) should be removed or preserved in ACDF procedures. [2] This debate has primarily arisen due to differences in management and that posterior longitudinal ligaments (PLL) are associated with complications in some patients. Specifically, the specific clinical indications for HPLL removal are still unknown during ACDF procedures. To date, studies are limited regarding the indication for the removal of HPLL in ACDF procedures for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) in patients with developmental cervical stenosis (DCS) or without DCS, which indicates congenital cervical vertebral canal stenosis. Therefore, in our retrospective study, the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients who underwent HPLL preservation were compared with patients with HPLL removal in order to elucidate the clinical indications for removal during ACDF procedures and to provide a standardized protocol based on HPLL mobility.",

In our study, HPLL was defined as the abnormal thickening of PLL greater than 3.5 mm and less than 5 mm without any ossified or calcified fragments. The presence of thickened HPLL was confirmed by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, demonstrating the presence of compressed segmental epidural bursa that is composed of dura mater, spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with spondylotic amyotrophy, tumors, rheumatoid arthritis, pyogenic spondylitis and comorbidities, central nerve system disorders, peripheral neuropathy, known psychiatric illnesses, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy or facet hypertrophy, ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament or calcification of posterior longitudinal ligament, and a history of previous cervical spine surgery or injury; patients with a spinal cord compressing rate greater than 30% measured by MRI according to the Takahashi classification system. [3] We set criteria for DCS patients, defined as a Pavlov ratio [4,5] <0.75. The Pavlov ratio was defined as the ratio between the sagittal diameter of spinal canal and the diameter of the vertebral body in the same segment measured in T2-weighted MRI scanning. [5,6] According to the aforementioned criteria, the patients were divided into 2 groups accordingly: DCS (group S) and non-DCS (group N). In anterior decompression procedures based on the mobility of HPLL, the 2 groups of patients were subdivided into 2 further subgroups according to whether the HPLL was removed or retained, which was detected under the operating microscope and head lamp. By the judgment of the relative position between the HPLL and adjacent upper and lower vertebral posterior edge attachment line, we made a decision to remove or preserve the PLL: if the HPLL showed insufficient mobility and the spinal cord remained compressed by the HPLL after decompression procedures behind the adjacent upper and lower vertebral posterior edge attachment line, then the HPLL was removed. Otherwise, the HPLL was preserved, as shown in Fig. 1. A total of 21 patients (13.2%) were lost to follow-up (9 due to noncompliance, 7 due to relocation, and 5 due to unknown whereabouts). Follow-up information was available for 138 out of the 159 patients (86.8%). Consequently, patients included were divided into 4 groups: group SR (HPLL removal n = 49, 32 males, 17 females, 58.4 \u00b1 9.5 years), group SP (HPLL preserved n = 32, 20 males, 12 females, 54.8 \u00b1 8.2 years) (Table 1), group NR (HPLL removal n = 21, 13 males, 8 females, 61.5 \u00b1 11.8 years), and group NP (HPLL preserved n = 36, 18 males, 18 females, 58.8 \u00b1 11.0 years) ( Table 1). The data of clinical demographics showed that there were no statistical differences (P > .05) between group SR and group SP, and group NR and group NP ( Table 1).",

In the removal group, the HPLL was separated from the dura mater and meticulously resected. In the preserved group, the HPLL was preserved without specific management. The spinal cord was free of compression after the procedures in all patients. During the discectomy procedure, the cartilage endplates were removed with curettage, and avoiding any additional damage to the endplate. The Caspar distractor was placed between adjacent vertebral bodies to perform distraction approximately 2 to 3 mm. A trial spacer was used to determine the appropriate implant size and type; a suitable polyether-ether-ketone cage (  (Fig. 2) was fixed onto the adjacent vertebrae with screws. Postoperatively, the patients were allowed to mobilize with a soft neck collar after bed rest for several days. Collar supports were removed after 4 to 6 weeks in all patients. All patients were followed up at 1, 6, 12, 24 months postoperatively. ",

The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey is a health status questionnaire that was developed 2 decades ago to assess functional status and well-being, [11] which has since been applied in a variety of clinical settings. [13][14][15] The mean operating time, blood loss, and any associated complications were also evaluated and compared between groups. Radiological examinations (MRI, CT, and X-rays) were performed preoperatively. X-rays were performed every 3 months, and MRI and CT scans were performed every 12 months postoperatively for all patients. To determine intra-and interobserver variability, radiological measurements were carried out by 2 senior radiologists, who performed radiological evaluations independently for each patient. The anteroposterior median sagittal diameter of the cervical spinal canal was measured at the most stenotic operating vertebral level ( Fig. 3) on sagittal T2-weighted MRI.

[2,19] However, Loughenbury et al [20] and Chen et al [21] demonstrated that the PLL also prevents protrusion of disc tissue into the spinal canal. PLL removal may lead to instability of the cervical spine and increase the risk of damage to the anatomical components of the cervical canal including the dura mater, spinal cord, nerve roots, and epidural vascular plexus. [12] Nevertheless, a clinical study conducted by Bai et al [17] has described the benefit of degenerative PLL removal in ACDF procedures for CSM. However, no definite indication was identified. Therefore, our study sought to identify the clinical indication for HPLL removal and to provide standardized removal in advance, based on HPLL mobility detected in ACDF for CSM patients.",

However, postoperative reduction in spinal canal diameter in the group SP was significantly faster than that in the group SR in DCS patients, which may reduce the long-term beneficial therapeutic effects of anterior decompression. However, no significant difference was found between the NR and NP groups in non-DCS patients (Table 2). Similarly, our data from DCS patients demonstrated that postoperative mJOA scores and neurological mRR scores in the SR group were significantly higher than those found in the SP group. These findings were in accordance with previously published studies. [18,22] Sagittal T2-weighted MRI scans showed that the mean median sagittal diameter of the cervical spinal canal was significantly wider in the SR group compared with the SP group. These results indicated that decompression was more effective after removal of HPLL in DCS patients. Improved mJOA and mRR (Table 2)    cervical spinal canal between the NR and NP groups at postoperative 24-month follow-up in non-DCS patients. In conclusion, mJOA and mRR scores, as well as the cervical spinal canal, did not benefit from removal of the HPLL in non-DCS patients ( Table 2). Postoperative recovery following ACDF procedures is affected by the presence of DCS. [23] In our study, diagnosis of DCS was based on the Pavlov ratio, which is a reliable determinant, instead of the true diameter of the cervical spinal canal. [24] A Pavlov ratio value less than 0.75 indicates cervical canal stenosis. [4,5] After multivariate adjustment for other covariates in DCS patients, removal of HPLL also correlated with higher mJOA scores, mRR and improved PCS and MCS (P < .05) representing an improved QoL. These findings suggest that HPLL removal correlated with positive clinical outcomes in DCS patients (Tables 3-6) at 24-month follow-up. However, removal of HPLL did not correlate with outcomes in non-DCS patients, which indicated that the removal of HPLL did not influence mJOA and mRR scores or PCS and MCS at 24-month follow-up.",

A small piece of muscle and fibrin glue, or the dura, was sutured directly onto the defect. Our study showed that removal of HPLL did not significantly increase the incidence of CSF leakage, with this procedure being safe, and effective for the management of CSF leakage. Iatrogenic neurological injury is a concern for spinal surgeons. Preoperative planning and proper surgical technique helps minimize potential injury. Seven cases in DCS patients and 5 cases in non-DCS patients were found to have transient postoperative muscle weakness. This may have arisen due to C5 nerve root withdrawal, [27] which may not be caused by nerve injury and has no definite associations with HPLL removal. Fortunately, these symptoms resolved gradually over a few weeks, and no significant difference was observed between the removal and retaining groups, both in DCS and non-DCS group. Additionally, due to epidural vascular plexus injury, postoperative hematomas have been occasionally described, [28] and these were consistent with the findings in our study. Although no serious compressive spinal cord symptoms in our study were observed, attention should be paid in order to avoid epidural vascular plexus injury, as such complications are often serious.",
