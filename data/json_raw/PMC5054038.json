A major challenge in exploiting these heterogeneous datasets is how to normalize the expression profiles by inter-assay methods. Different non-linear and linear normalization methods have been developed, which essentially rely on the hypothesis that the true or perceived logarithmic fold-change distributions between two different assays are symmetric in nature. However, asymmetric gene expression changes are frequently observed, leading to suboptimal normalization results and in consequence potentially to thousands of false calls. Therefore, we have specifically investigated asymmetric comparative transcriptome profiles and developed the normalization using weighted negative second order exponential error functions (NeONORM) for robust and global inter-assay normalization. NeONORM efficiently damps true gene regulatory events in order to minimize their misleading impact on the normalization process. We evaluated NeONORM's applicability using artificial and true experimental datasets, both of which demonstrated that NeONORM could be systematically applied to inter-assay and inter-condition comparisons.",

Microarray technology has seen considerable advances in the number of transcripts that can be detected simultaneously as well as the precision of the measurement. Several all-in-one commercial solutions and a multitude of array scanner systems in the public domain have emerged. However, these technologic solutions often diverge in the design of the probes and the method of transcript detection, making the statistical analysis of transcriptome data challenging and non-uniform ( 6 , 7). Microarray technology cannot be used for absolute but only relative *Corresponding author. Email: arndtQihes.fr quantification of the abundance of individual transcripts (8). Obviously, this fact greatly complicates the successful analysis of microarray experiments. As for inter-assay comparisons, which hence need to be carried out for relative quantification between two different biologic samples, efficient and accurate normalization methods have to be developed (9)(10)(11).",

Note that normalization methods are based solely on control probes for which synthetic transcripts are added at different moments during the experimentation, assuming analogously invariance and symmetry of the control signals. Since solely internal control based normalization fails to capture sample related technical variation and is not very robust, it is rarely used by itself. The first invariance assumption for the majority of probes, in the limit of large probe sets, seems to hold and can be biologically justified. Furthermore, this assumption is necessarily required for the principle of inter-assay normalization based on probe signals to be meaningful. The second assumption about symmetry of the probe variation distribution, which is exploited in non-discriminant averaging normalizations, cannot be justified from a biological point of view. This assumption only holds true for technical replicates generated from a single biologic sample.",

When comparing distinct physiologic situations, the symmetry assumption seems to be poorly reflecting biological reality. A multitude of biologic processes can be cited that will consequently lead to asymmetric changes in the expression profile of a cell. For instance, inherently asymmetric processes such as apoptosis or mitotic repression will lead to a majority of genes being down-regulated and only a comparatively small fraction being induced (17,18). Furthermore, due to their very different mechanistic nature, transcription activation and repression mechanisms follow distinct dynamics. Consequently, such asymmetries are frequently observed in \"real world\" data ( 19,20). Since these asymmetries are not corrected in technical and/or biological replicates, they reflect true biological variations. Most inter-assay normakmtion Geno. Prot. Bioinfo. methods do not account for such asymmetries and use non-discriminant averaging (mean, median) for normalization of these data. It is obvious that averaging methods, provided the asymmetry is of sufficient significance to exceed numerical precision, will lead to suboptimal normalization factor estimation. Such considerations, especially in the case of the so-called boutique arrays where the invariance assumption cannot be made, have lead to the development of discriminant normalization methods (21,22). Here, only either pre-defined or conditionally determined subsets of probes are used for the normalization process. For the former, either the so-called house-keeping genes that are thought to be invariant in their expression across a large number of cellular conditions, or external and synthetic probe/target pairs are added to the experimental pipeline at different points in time, and then are considered for normalization. However, such methods have significant disadvantages. The notion of a house-keeping gene is at best empiric and often circumstantial (23). Dynamic determination (no a priori assumptions made) of the probes to be considered for normalization could be a solution to this problem. Unfortunately, few methods exist for such a type of inter-assay normalization (22,24 ). Those methods, however, are either expression rank-based (22,(25)(26)(27), or depend on Statistical tests that are performed after inter-assay comparison/subtraction profiles have been calculated (14 ). Especially in view of the increasing sensitivity of some microarray solutions, analysis methods that do not or only partially consider information on individual signal variance, will lead to suboptimal statistical interpretation of the transcriptome data (9).",

Our central assumption in the reasoning leading up to the NeONORM method is that except for technical replicates, the common hypothesis of symmetry of fold-change distributions is not well founded for inter-assay comparisons. In order to avoid implementing several different methods specifically tailored to and distinguishing explicitly between technical replicates, biological replicates, and comparisons of truly different conditions, ideally, this novel method would also intrinsically adapt according to the nature of the inter-assay comparison. Therefore, the method would behave in the limit of technical replicates and highly symmetric fold-change distributions, which is closely similar to the existing, averaging, and linear methods such as Median normalization.",

For illustration, we have sketched the product of two between the contributions of both functions, and can hence not be used. The NeONORM error function, however, approximates the multiplicative functions in the bounds of 1x1 <EP, and for 1x1 >EP, the error becomes essentially invariant (Figure 2A).

We have furthermore contended that the NeONORM error function at k10.20 still closely resembles the quadratic error function in case of symmetric fold-change distributions ( Figure 5A). We find this assumption confirmed using the technical HT29 replicates since the normalization factors a are virtually identical for both methods (a~=0.0000, a~=-0.0045). Note that the small differences of both curves in the frequency plot are rather due to rounding differences in the bin- however, NeONORM clearly much better normalizes this dataset as well ( Figure 7A3: a~=-0.1672, a~=-0.0038). The fact that Median normalization does not lead to identical results here is due to the successively random choosing of probe subsets for modification, which, as can be easily shown, highly unlikely leads to perfectly symmetric data. Together with the initial unmodified data shown in Figure  7A1, this experiment demonstrates that NeONORM is insensitive to the presence of asymmetric heavy tails in the fold-change distributions, whereas averaging normalization methods for obvious reasons fail to correctly normalize the datasets. In Figure 7B, we look at Median ( Figure 7B1) vs. NeONORM (Figure 7B2) normalization performance on the remaining nine artificial datasets shown in Figure 5B. As before, NeONORM correctly normalizes the different datasets such that the maxima of the increasingly perturbed datasets all superimpose at logQ=O. Median normalization, in contrast, leads to maxima being gradually (as a function of the perturbation of the artificial dataset) shifted towards negative logQ values ( Figure 7B1). Figure 7B3 summarizes these -0.00601. In conclusion, the NeONORM method performs very well even on highly asymmetric data, and is robust with respect to the grade of the asymmetry [the range covered is from near zero (technical replicates shown in Figure 7A1) to a point that certainly exceeds any natural occurring gene regulatory event ( Figure 7B3)].",

In this case, we additionally compared NeONORM performance relative to an implementation of the LOWESS algorithm (32-34). LOWFSS is a very well performing non-linear normalization method widely used for intra-and inter-assay normalization ( Ref. 12,32; see Materials and Methods). The results of the direct comparisons are summarized in Figure 8A. The three panels show histogram plots for the logQ distributions of the second artificial dataset (Table 1; see Materials and Methods) as functions of the normalization methods. As was true for the previous dataset, Median normalization results in successive \"migration\" of the distribution maximum towards negative logQ values as a function of the severity of the perturbation ( Figure 8A1). The LOWESS method seems to perform much better than Median normalization, as much as the maximum of the distribution is more stable around the logQ=O point. However, when the perturbations of the original dataset become more and more severe (here especially evident for f =1/8 and f=1/4), the maximum of the distribution also shifts towards negative logQ values, indicating that the LOWESS method cannot correct for the asymmetries in the logQ distribution. Furthermore, due to the nature of the non-linear approach, the relative stability of LOWESS at low f values is counterbalanced by a significant distortion of the data (compare characteristic peaks at the maximum or the heavy tails between all distributions and with respect to the normalization methods). By contrast, NeONORM again performs equally well on all eight conditions, with the maxima of the distributions perfectly superimposed at logQ=O. Note that due to the linear nature of the normalization operation, no distortion of the distributions occurs. In order to demonstrate the significance of the differences in normalization factor ai over this experimental series, we have generated a probe call table using arbitrary thresholds for logQ (as the nature and absolute I/* 1.5 f 0.15 VS. HT29(2); UM=-0.4774, UN= value of the thresholds do not matter), and compared the differences in logQ calls (Table 2). It is apparent from this table that NeONORM, due to more accurate normalization, is the only method that shows constant logQ< -1 calls [see column with relative values, note that variation (negative values) is due to the normal distribution properties of the random drawing of factors during the perturbation of the data]. f i rthermore, the logQ> 1 calls are proportional to the severity of the perturbation. Median normalized data, as expected by the nature of the operation, almost \"grow\" symmetrically over both thresholds, whereas LOWESS normalization generates satisfactory results for slightly biased test data and just starts to diverge significantly from NeONORM at f > 1/32. The distortion of the dataset also becomes apparent when comparing the total numbers of probe calls beyond the two thresholds.",

Since those synthetic data were generated from the HT29(1) dataset (see Materials and Methods), we can calculate the number of probe calls that should occur in a comparison with HT29(1) using the correct normalization factor a,=O. Any deviation from this calculated number is to be considered an error introduced through the normalization method that was applied. According to the nature of the false call (false positive or false negative), we can determine the type of error [incorrect rejection of a true null-hypothesis (I) or failure to reject a false zero hypothesis (11) of non-change]. Table 3 lists the results where the two types of errors were calculated as percent false calls when subtracting the four increasingly asymmetric synthetic datasets from the original HT29(1) dataset. We thereby investigated the 99% confidence interval for our zerohypothesis and set a cut-off for determining the number of probe calls at IlogQI > 1.00. Note that due to the use of random number generators when creating the synthetic files, the calculated expected probe calls are associated with a variance. Thus, only errors superior to 0.038% are significant (bold-face).

When very significant asymmetries are introduced (up to a quarter of all probe signals being modified), NeONORM starts to gener-ate some Type I1 errors; however, the values are still well below the Type I1 errors observed with Median normalization. NeONORM thus indeed significantly reduces the number of false calls due to inadequate or inefficient inter-assay normalization. Most importantly, NeONORM avoids Type I errors.",

Median normalization leads to a very significantly shifted maximum (blue curve); LOWESS shows intermediate performance with respect to positioning of the maximum, but distorts the distribution (grey curve) when compared to NeONORM. Since these are non-controlled data (in the sense that we have not generated the asymmetry ourselves), we can only judge the relative performance. On the other hand, since the data are individually (intra-assay) median pre-normalized, the fact that the NeONORM normalization factor is close to zero [a~=-0.4106, aN=0.0000, note that aL (given the non-linear nature) cannot be directly determined, and can only be estimated by renormalizing these data with NeONORM and determining the required normalization factor aaNL, which repositions the LOWESS maximum back to superimpose exactly with the NeONORM value UUNL=-0.0399] indicates that NeONORM here again performs close to optimum. As for the artificial data in Figure 8A, we also performed the probe call test (Table 4) to demonstrate the significant impact of choice of inter-assay normal-ization on potential results of comparative studies. Interestingly, due to the compression of the data during the LOWESS normalization, this method performs most poorly on the dataset (highest number of potentially false \"down-regulated\" calls, and lowest number of \"up-regulated\" calls) when compared to the other two methods. These results clearly can only be an indication of the relative performance of the three methods, as at present we can neither establish this dataset as representative for transcriptome studies, nor estimate the number of \"down-\" and \"up-regulated\" calls we should expect. However, given the detailed analysis we have performed above using artificially (in a well-controlled manner) modified data, NeONORM is the only method that shows robustness towards asymmetric logQ distributions. Given the fact that our two distinct strategies for generating these test datasets largely cover what could be expected to occur in real biologic samples as maximal asymmetry, and show that NeONORM scales very well with the degree of asymmetry and performs perfectly well in the limit of maximal symmetric data, we can draw the conclusion that NeONORM overcomes the problems associated with the standard symmetry hypothesis in linear inter-assay normalization.",

It seems obvious from the sign plots presented in Figures 4 and 5 that k for practical reasons should be sufficiently large to assure that the error function is not estimated within the multiple bifurcation region where individual or small group of co-varying probes attain significant influence. On the other hand, k should be chosen as small as possible in order to ascertain maximum sensitivity of the NeONORM method with respect to asymmetric logQ distributions. While other methods such as LOWESS normalization sometimes also possess even several \"free\" parameters (32,33), and much effort has been devoted to identify empirical optimal parameter ranges ( l a ) , we feel that in the case of NeONORM, a formal way of definition might be possible as parameter k directly reflects an inherent property of the analyzed data. To derive a formal way of selecting parameter k will thus represent a major challenge towards the perfection of the NeONORM method. We specifically invite suggestions or ideas towards such a formal derivation of k. At the same time, we have taken great care in the empiric derivation of a suitable k as demonstrated during the evaluation of the overall performance of the NeONORM method. The range of possible asymmetries covered through our artificial test datasets should assure that NeONORM performs in a robust fashion with respect to true physiologic datasets.",
