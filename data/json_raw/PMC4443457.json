The orthosis reduces activation and force production of the calf muscles while it permits full gravitational loading of the lower leg. MRI measurements of the knee and ankle were taken before the intervention, during the intervention (on day 49), and 14 days after the end of the intervention. Cartilage segmentation was conducted semiautomatically for the knee joint (4 segments) and for the upper (tibio-talar) and lower (subtalar) ankle joints (2 segments each). Linear mixed-effects (LME) models were used for statistical analysis."

Reduced GAG content may be interpreted as an early sign of cartilage degeneration (Bashir et al. 1996).

It substantially reduces plantar flexor torque and muscle activation (measured by electromyography), and it affects arterial diameter (measured by ultrasound) (Weber et al. 2013a(Weber et al. , b,2014. When the orthosis is worn, normal movement in the knee joint is possible. Flexion and extension are limited in the upper ankle joint, while supination and pronation of the lower ankle joint are not possible. Tibio-talar forces are reduced by three-quarters, while femoro-tibial forces are unaltered when wearing HEPHAISTOS. Force development of the gastrocne-mius muscle and its pull on the calcaneus through the Achilles tendon are reduced by the absence of counter-forces on the forefoot (unpublished observations). The mechanical role of the ankle during walking is taken over by a metallic joint below the foot with an integrated spring that replaces the role of the calf muscle. To investigate the influence of the orthosis on joint cartilage, we analyzed the knee joint and the upper (tibiotalar) and lower (subtalar) ankle joints. The orthosis was manufactured individually for each subject by ORTEMA GmbH (Markgr\u00f6ningen, Germany).

            "text": "Observations in the literature The dGEMRIC protocol was initially developed to assess the glycosaminoglycan content of knee joint cartilage (Bashir et al. 1996, 1997, 1999, Burstein et al. 2001. The dGEM-RIC method was recently applied to the upper ankle joint (Domayer et al. 2010, Wiewiorski et al. 2013. To our knowledge, the dGEMRIC method has not been applied to the lower ankle joint before, probably because the cartilage is thin and segmentation is technically difficult. We found that the dGEMRIC protocol can be used to assess relative changes in the GAG content of the lower ankle joint, which may be of interest for research in foot and ankle surgery as well as for rheumatology. Unloading has been shown to reduce cartilage thickness (Eckstein et al. 2014). By analyzing MRI images taken before and after 14 days of 6\u00b0 head down tilt bed rest in human subjects, Liphardt et al. (2009) showed that the articular knee cartilage thickness is sensitive to unloading. They found a substantial decrease in thickness of the tibial knee joint cartilage but not in the thickness of femoral knee joint cartilage. Wang et al. (2010) performed a 4-week tail suspension study on rats and found decreases in cartilage thickness of the patella and the medial femoral condyle. Vanwanseele et al. (2002a, b) found progressive thinning of the knee cartilage in patients with spinal cord injuries. Hinterwimmer et al. (2004) showed thinning of articular cartilage already after 7 weeks of par-tial load bearing. Regarding cartilage thickness, changes were usually found to occur throughout unloading and not after reloading. Mayerhoefer et al. (2010) analyzed the effect of 15 min of unloading of the knee joint on T1-Gd with the dGEMRIC method and found that there was no statistically significant effect on T1-Gd relaxation times. Long-term unloading of human joint cartilage has not, however, been investigated previously with this method. The effects of selective muscular unloading on joint cartilage during normal weight bearing had also not been investigated before our study. One might think that the GAG content decreases during unloading, just as cartilage thickness has been shown to decrease. Our results, however, indicate that a decrease in glycosaminoglycan content may occur after reloading following muscular inactivation, depending on the joint location and the type of immobilization. It remains unclear, however, whether reloading causes remodeling or whether remodeling is just delayed and takes a while to occur. Other studies have shown changes in GAG content in cartilage tissue to occur within a few weeks (Roos et al. 2005, Van Ginckel et al. 2010. However, the timing of changes in joint cartilage GAG content remains unclear. Increased \u0394T 1 is thought to be correlated with reduced glycosaminoglycan content, and it is usually interpreted as a sign of early degeneration (Bashir et al. 1996(Bashir et al. , 1999. Our findings indicate that degeneration of joint cartilage might in some cases follow reloading after a longer period of unloading. Future studies in this field should therefore include a followup period after reambulation.",

When the orthosis is worn, normal movement is possible in the knee joint while flexion and extension are limited in the upper ankle joint and supination and pronation are not possible in the lower ankle joint. The subtalar joint has an angle of 30-40\u00b0 to the horizontal line. Supination and pronation are the possible movements of the subtalar joint, and both are made impossible while wearing HEPHAISTOS. The subtalar joint is therefore almost completely immobilized by the orthosis, while the upper ankle joint is only partially restricted (extension and flexion of the ankle) and the knee joint is not restricted at all. Furthermore, tibial forces are known to load eccentrically on the calcaneus, leading to torque and shear stresses in the joint. Forces are not distributed homogenously throughout the articular surface of the subtalar joint (Mueller et al. 2014). In cases in which the stabilizing muscles were atrophied after the intervention, shear stresses may have exceeded their normal extent and led to cartilage impairment.",

The findings may fuel the ongoing discussions for or against nonoperative and operative treatment options in a number of conditions (Cohen andBalcom 2003, Jiang et al. 2012). For these considerations, it would be of interest to know how long the reduction in GAGs lasts, how its timely development takes place, and the degree to which it is reversible.
