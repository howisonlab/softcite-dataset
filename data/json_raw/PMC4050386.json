            "text": "The concurrence of tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) with the spread of its vector Bemisia tabaci Q rather than B in China suggests a more mutualistic relationship between TYLCV and Q. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that viruliferous B and Q have different effects on plant defenses. We found the fecundity of nonviruliferous B, nonviruliferous Q, viruliferous Q and viruliferous B was 11.080, 12.060, 10.760, and 11.220 respectively on plants previously attacked by the other biotype, however, on their respective noninfested control leaves fecundity was 12.000, 10.880, 9.760, and 8.020 respectively. Only viruliferous B had higher fecundity on viruliferous Q-infested plants than on control plants. The longevity of viruliferous B showed the same phenomenon. At 1 d infestion, the jasmonic acid content in leaves noninfested and in leaves infested with nonviruliferous B, nonviruliferous Q, viruliferous B and viruliferous Q was 407.000, 281.333, 301.333, 266.667 and 134.000 ng/g FW, respectively. The JA content was lowest in viruliferous Q-infested leaves. The proteinase inhibitor activity and expression of JA-related upstream gene LOX and downstream gene PI II showed the same trend. The substantial suppression of host defenses by Q carrying TYLCV probably enhances the spread of Q and TYLCV in China. A bout 80% of plant viruses depend on insect vectors for their transmission 1,2 , and recent research showed that plant viruses, like other pathogens and parasites, can induce changes in their hosts or vectors that can enhance their transmission 3,4. The three-way interaction between virus, plant, and insect vector is complex. Plant viruses can directly and indirectly (via the host plant) modify the growth and development of their vectors. At the same time, feeding by viruliferous vectors can affect plant defense responses, inverse, plant also affects viruliferous vectors 5,6. Both the plant virus and the vector may benefit from such changes from plants. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is a phloem-feeding pest that causes serious damage by its direct feeding and by its transmission of plant viruses 7. B. tabaci is a species complex consisting of morphologically indistinguishable biotypes that differ in feeding behavior, endosymbiont communities, insecticide resistance, virus transmission, or other properties 8-12. B. tabaci B and Q are the two most invasive and harmful whiteflies; they have invaded nearly 60 countries and have caused massive agricultural losses during the past two decades 13. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a single-stranded DNA plant virus in the genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae. It is transmitted by B. tabaci in a persistent and circulative manner. TYLCV has recently become a serious threat to tomato production in many countries 14-16. In China, TYLCV was not detected until B. tabaci Q became established in 2005, even though B. tabaci B is an important vector of TYLCV and has been found in China since the mid-1990's 10,17. The concurrence of the spread of TYLCV with the invasion of B. tabaci Q rather than B suggests that the relationship between TYLCV and B. tabaci is more mutualistic for Q than B 6,10,12,18. Our recent research showed that TYLCV indirectly benefits B. tabaci Q 6,18 but directly and indirectly harms B. tabaci B 6. In this context, indirect benefit or harm is mediated by the host plant. Plant-mediated interactions between plant pathogens and herbivorous arthropods are potentially important determinants of the population dynamics of both the pathogens and the arthropods in managed and natural ecosystems 19. Plant defenses including those involving jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) play key regulatory roles in the interaction of insects and their vectored viruses 20. Proteinase inhibitor (PI) and other defense-related proteins are also inducible during insect feeding 21,22 , and their related gene expression such as PI II in resisting insect herbivores have been well demonstrated 23-25. Zhang et al. (2004) 24 showed that the expression of PI II gene is caused"

The prevailing view is that the SA pathway induces resistance against biotrophic pathogens and some phloem feeders, whereas the JA pathway induces resistance against chewing herbivores, some phloem-feeding insects, and necrotrophic pathogens 26 . Few studies, however, have investigated the role of JA or SA when a plant is simultaneously inoculated with an insect vector and virus 5,27 . Our latest study showed that SA content was always higher in leaves infested with viruliferous B than with viruliferous Q 5 . Furthermore, the relative gene expression associated with SA signaling was increased by the feeding of viruliferous B but not by the feeding of viruliferous Q 5 . Zhang et al. (2012)  27 demonstrated that co-infection of the begomovirus tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) and its betasatellite can repress JA-regulated defenses of tobacco against invasive whiteflies and accelerate population increases of the insects. Our recent study also showed that the interactions between tomato plant, TYLCV, and B. tabaci Q can reduce JA-and PI-associated plant defense 28 . However, the comprehensive understanding of plantmediated interaction between viruliferous B and Q is still limited.",

The indirect losses resulting from virus transmission far surpass the direct losses resulting from feeding. In recent years, B. tabaci Q has invaded China 34 and has now displaced B as the predominant B. tabaci in most parts of the country 17 . Concurrent with the spread of B. tabaci Q, TYLCV outbreaks have caused great damage to tomato production in many provinces in China 10 . In this study, we determined how the interaction between B. tabaci B and Q is affected by their virus status. The results showed that when plants were first damaged by nonviruliferous B and Q, the performance of the B. tabaci that subsequently infested the plants was not affected. However, the fecundity and longevity of viruliferous B were significantly higher on plants that had been previously infested by viruliferous Q than on noninfested plants. The fecundity and longevity of viruliferous Q were not affected on plants that were previously attacked by viruliferous B and on noninfested plants. In other words, the feeding by nonviruliferous B. tabaci did not affect the performance of B. tabaci that followed, but the feeding of viruliferous Q enhanced the performance of viruliferous B that followed. In addition, the viral load was significantly higher in viruliferous Q-infected leaves than in viruliferous Binfected leaves at 7 days after the initial inoculation. We concluded that the interactions between B. tabaci B and Q were differentially altered by TYLCV depending on which biotypes of B. tabaci initially infested the host plant. Most importantly, the results indicated that infestation by viruliferous B. tabaci Q reduced the plant's defense against subsequent infestation by B. tabaci.",

Our recent study also showed that viruliferous Q reduced the JA content to a lower level than nonviruliferous Q 28 . Furthermore, our study determined that the endogenous JA content of leaves was greatly reduced by infestation with viruliferous Q but only moderately reduced by infestation with nonviruliferous Q, nonviruliferous B, or viruliferous B.

Our results showed that LOX was induced and PI II was reduced, which are consistent with previous study indicating that the upstream gene LOX2 was induced, whereas the downstream gene VSP1 was reduced after B. tabaci nymph infestion 45 . For example, LOX2 transcript was significantly induced by B. tabaci nymph feeding at 14 d but not at 7 d after infestation 45 . In our study, the gene expression of LOX was induced at 1 d after infestation, so we speculate that there may be a different process of gene response in tomato and Arabidopsis. Besides, the JA-related defense response induced by adults may be different from nymphs because nymphs have a long-term interaction with plants whereas adults may induce a transient response. Furthermore, our data indicated that JA pathway was differently manipulated by nonviruliferous and viruliferous B. tabaci B and Q. The gene expression was always reduced to a lower level by infestion of viruliferous Q than by infestion of nonviruliferous Q, nonviruliferous B, and viruliferous B, regardless of LOX or PI II.",

            "text": "The effects of viruliferous B. tabaci Q can be explained in several related ways. First, TYLCV infection may reduce levels of carbohydrates and amino acids in leaves and in the phloem in ways that reduce plant quality for viruliferous B but not for viruliferous Q. Second, the feeding behaviors of B. tabaci B and Q may differ. Our recent study showed that when nonviruliferous whiteflies fed on healthy and TYLCV-infected tomato plants, B. tabaci Q engaged in more phloem salivation and phloem sap ingestion than B. tabaci B 12 . Third, virus infection could change the primary and secondary compounds produced by the host plant, which in turn could differ-entially affect the performance of B. tabaci B and Q. Further experiments are needed to investigate the biochemical and physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of TYLCV on B. tabaci B and Q.",

These different responses to TYLCVcarrying B and Q are likely to favor the spread of Q and TYLCV in China. More research is needed to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which viruliferous B. tabaci Q suppresses plant defense."

In other words, each tomato plant was inoculated by 300 viruliferous or nonviruliferous whiteflies for seven days. Control plants with the same size were placed in five clip cages per plant without whiteflies. There were each of 10 plants with nonviruliferous B, nonviruliferous Q, viruliferous B, viruliferous Q respectively, and 40 noninfested control plants. After seven days, all whiteflies adults, instars and eggs were removed gently with a brush from the clip cages, and the control plants were also treated with a brush, and then one adult female (two days since eclosion) was placed in one of five clip cages on each plant. The adult females were either B or Q. For example, one viruliferous Q was added to one of five leaves on each of 10 plants previously exposed to viruliferous B and to one of five leaves on 10 non-infested control plants. Similarly, one viruliferous B was added to one of five leaves on each of 10 plants that had been previously exposed to viruliferous Q and to 10 non-infested control plants. After one day, the whitefly on one leave was replaced with another leave of the five leaves. The same was done with nonviruliferous B and Q. The new eggs deposited on the leaves during the first 5 days were counted. The mean longevity of B. tabaci was calculated after all whiteflies had died."
