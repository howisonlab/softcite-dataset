However, clinical trials testing anti-FOLR1 therapies in OvCa show mixed results and require better understanding of the prognostic relevance of FOLR1 expression. We conducted a large study evaluating FOLR1 expression with survival in different histological types of OvCa.",

FOLR1 has high affinity for binding folic acid (Parker et al, 2005). Because folate is essential for DNA synthesis and one-carbon transfer, it has been hypothesised that FOLR1 might confer a growth advantage to the tumour by modulating folate uptake (Kane et al, 1988) or generating regulatory signals (Miotti et al, 2000). However, others showed that FOLR1 was not the major transport route for intracellular accumulation of physiological folates or anti-folates in various cell lines including the IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cells (Kamen and Smith, 2012), thereby disputing the theory of FOLR1medicated tumour uptake of folate for proliferation.",

FOLR1 selectivity, affinity and restricted tissue distribution has christened it as a universal target for exploitation (van Dam et al, 2011) for therapy or imaging of solid tumours (Leamon and Reddy, 2004) or circulating tumour cells (He et al, 2008). Different treatment modalities have been proposed including folic acid-conjugated toxins that bind FOLR1 and release the toxin upon internalisation to kill tumour cells (Kelemen, 2006), and antitumour immune-based therapies that enhance the body's natural immunity against tumour cells (Knutson et al, 2006). However, clinical trials testing therapies against FOLR1 in ovarian carcinoma have produced mixed results. For example, farletuzumab (Konner et al, 2010;Spannuth et al, 2010;Armstrong et al, 2013) is a humanised monoclonal antibody against FOLR1, which was shown to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity and to inhibit cell growth of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with FOLR1 when grown in low-folate medium (Ebel et al, 2007), although subsequent studies showed it minimally altered cell growth in cell lines naturally expressing FOLR1, including IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cells (Kamen and Smith, 2012). The results from a phase III clinical trial (NCT00849667) found that farletuzumab in combination with carboplatin and taxane did not meet the study's primary end point of progression-free survival (PFS), and analyses are ongoing in patient subsets (Walters et al, 2013). More recently, a phase II clinical trial reported longer median PFS among 100 selected patients with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma who were treated with a combination of vintafolide, a folic acid-desacetylvinblastine conjugate that binds to the folate receptor, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) compared with 49 patients who received PLD alone (5.0 vs 2.7 months PFS, respectively; P \u00bc 0.03) (Naumann et al, 2013). The drug was particularly effective in patients diffusely positive for FOLR1. No difference in overall survival (OS) was detected, although the trial was not powered to detect a statistical difference (Naumann et al, 2013).",

In the OTTA consortium, OS was defined as death from any cause after ovarian carcinoma diagnosis and PFS was defined as survival without disease progression or recurrence determined by radiological, serological or clinical evidence or death from any cause, whichever came first. Stage at diagnosis was determined using the cancer registry and/or FIGO stage information from each site (SEER guidelines: http://seer.cancer.gov/) and categorised as FIGO stage I/II (localised and regional) and FIGO stage III/IV (distant). Because time from diagnosis to study entry was variable, we allowed for left truncation with time at risk starting on the date of diagnosis and time under observation beginning at the time of study entry. Analyses were right censored at 5 years after ovarian carcinoma diagnosis in order to reduce the number of non-ovarian carcinoma-related deaths. The proportional hazard assumption was evaluated with standard diagnostic methods, including likelihood ratio tests comparing models with and without terms that modelled covariates as a function of followup time on the natural logarithmic scale (Hosmer and Lameshow, 1999). Final models were fitted using Cox regression stratified by study to correct for violations of the proportional hazard assumption and adjusted for potential confounding with age at diagnosis (o70 or X70 years), FIGO tumour stage (I/II, III/IV or missing) and presence of residual disease at primary surgery (macroscopic, no macroscopic or missing). An interaction term between the aforementioned covariates and follow-up time was included, where necessary, to improve model fit. In addition, we considered models separately by the FIGO tumour stage. Data for regression analyses were available for 2636 patients following the exclusion of patients with missing vital status (N \u00bc 13), missing time from diagnosis to study entry (N \u00bc 66), missing follow-up time (N \u00bc 43), missing FIGO stage (N \u00bc 84, excluded for stagestratified analyses only) and patients with study entry 45 years from diagnosis (N \u00bc 43).",

Both findings were more pronounced among patients with FIGO stage I/II tumours. Both our OTTA data and those we analysed from TCGA provide evidence, for the first time, that the association between FOLR1 expression and OS in HGSC changes with the duration of follow-up regardless of whether FOLR1 was measured as protein or mRNA. Previous studies reported either unfavourable prognosis    All models except FIGO stage I/II model additionally adjusted for platinum sensitivity (resistant, sensitive, too early or missing) and treatment response (complete response, partial response, progressive disease, stable disease or missing). (Chen et al, 2012) or no adverse association (Kalli et al, 2008;Crane et al, 2012) between FOLR1 protein or mRNA and OS. Time following diagnosis in those studies ranged from B6.5 years (Chen et al, 2012) to 15 years (Kalli et al, 2008) and an average of the HR would obscure the modifying effect of follow-up time, as observed in the current investigation when we did not stratify by follow-up time. The change in association between FOLR1 expression and OS was more evident among FIGO stage I/II tumours in OTTA, whereas TCGA was composed mainly of FIGO stage III/IV tumours. For HGSC that did not express FOLR1, patients were observed to have an increased rate of death within 2 years after diagnosis, which attenuated with follow-up time. We speculated whether the absence of FOLR1 expression in the primary HGSC tumour was an indicator of tumours that responded poorly to standard platinum chemotherapy. Inclusion of treatment response indicators in statistical models that were available in the TCGA data analysis, however, did not weaken the associations with OS and did not support this hypothesis. Although it is possible that FOLR1 expression itself may have changed with follow-up time to explain our observations, this is not supported by studies that showed no significant change in FOLR1 expression following chemotherapy in patients with HGSC-matched tumour from primary surgery and either interval debulking surgery or surgery for recurrent disease (Crane et al, 2012;Despierre et al, 2013). It is possible, therefore, that differences between patients with FOLR1negative poor-prognosis HGSC and FOLR1-positive tumours, which showed a survival advantage, may be from differences in intrinsic tumour biology.  The association between FOLR1 protein expression and decrease in PFS interval in patients with CCC and, specifically FIGO stage I/II tumours, is potentially interesting and will require independent confirmation. FIGO stage I/II tumours comprise the majority of CCC (almost 80% of CCC and 12% of all patients in our study) and their optimal management represents a clinical dilemma, because B20% of patients relapse and are resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy (Kobel et al, 2010a;Anglesio et al, 2011). Existing clinical trials that are testing therapies to FOLR1 expression in ovarian carcinoma are comprised mostly of HGSC and one reported a favourable outcome among patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian carcinoma (Naumann et al, 2013), which is a clinical profile similar to CCC. Interestingly, that study (Naumann et al, 2013) included eight patients with CCC (seven in the vintafolide arm). It remains to be evaluated whether targeting therapies specifically to FOLR1 in patients with CCC and FIGO stage I/II tumours improves their survival.",

Further, only B30% of CCC and EC, and 11% of MC were positive for FOLR1. These estimates are lower than those reported previously and may be from the much smaller sample sizes evaluated in studies of HGSC (N \u00bc 36-73) (Kelemen et al, 2005;Despierre et al, 2013;O'Shannessy et al, 2013) and of other histological types (Kalli et al, 2008;Crane et al, 2012). We also observed FOLR1 expression in normal fallopian tube tissue samples, which is increasingly accepted as the cell of origin for most HGSC (Piek et al, 2001;Crum et al, 2007). Others also reported strong FOLR1 expression in normal fallopian tube (Veggian et al, 1989;O'Shannessy et al, 2013), postulating that FOLR1 tumour expression is maintained from cell type-oforigin (O'Shannessy et al, 2013). However, at least two previous studies found strong FOLR1 expression in normal ovarian surface epithelium (Wu et al, 1999;Kelemen et al, 2005), including one that prospectively collected ovarian surface epithelial samples from healthy postmenopausal women undergoing oophorectomy (Kelemen et al, 2005). Given the difficulty to obtain viable normal ovarian surface epithelium, we question whether earlier studies (Veggian et al, 1989;Ross et al, 1994;Parker et al, 2005) found low expression in ovarian stroma rather than epithelium.",
