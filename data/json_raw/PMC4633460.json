            "text": "Original article Objective(s): N-myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is a candidate gene for tumor suppression. The expression of NDRG2 is down-regulated in several tumors including lung cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of NDRG2 overexpression on invasion, migration, and enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and-9 (MMP-9) in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Materials and Methods: A recombinant plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged NDRG2 (pCMV6-AC-NDRG2-GFP) was used to overexpress GFP-tagged NDRG2 in A549 cells. The cells in the experimental group and those in the control group were transfected with pCMV6-AC-NDRG2-GFP and a control plasmid without NDRG2 (pCMV6-AC-GFP), respectively. Fluorescent microscopy and flowcytometry analysis of GFP expression were used to evaluate the cellular expression of GFP-tagged NDRG2 and the efficiency of transfection. The effects of NDRG2 expression on cell invasion and migration were evaluated using transwell filter migration assay. The gelatinase activity of secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9 was measured by gelatin zymography. Results: Our results demonstrated the expression of GFP-tagged NDRG2 in the cytoplasm and nucleus of A549 cells. The findings of transwell assay showed that NDRG2 overexpression reduced migration and invasion of A549 cells compared to control cells. Gelatin zymography analyses revealed that NDRG2 overexpression decreased the gelatinase activity of secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9. Conclusion: These findings suggest that NDRG2 may be a new anti-invasion factor in lung cancer that inhibits MMPs activities."

            "text": "Lung cancer is one of the major causes of cancer related death in the world (1). The incidence and mortality rate of this malignancy is increasing annually. Lung cancer is often diagnosed in the late stages, when the tumor cells have been metastasized (2,3). Currently, platin-based cytotoxic chemotherapy and removal of metastatic tumors by surgery are available therapeutic options. Resistance to chemotherapy and recurrence of metastatic tumors are major limitations of these treatments. Metastasis is a complex and multistep process which includes degradation of the extracellular matrix, migration of tumor cells into blood or lymph circulation, and invasion to other tissues (4). Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes is very crucial because it could lead to development of new therapeutic strategies. N-myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) belongs to NDRG family and encodes a 41KD cytoplasmic protein (5). It is normally expressed in several tissues and involved in multiple biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (5)(6)(7). Increasing evidence indicates the role of NDRG2 as a tumor suppressor in the control of cell growth and metastasis of tumor cells (5,8,9). Reduced expression of NDRG2 has been shown in several cancers including breast (10), colon (11), renal cell carcinoma (12), glioblastom (13), liver (14), and lung (15). On the other hand, overexpression of NDRG2 leads to inhibition of proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cell lines (16)(17)(18)(19). Li et al (15) has recently reported down-regulation of NDRG2 gene in human lung cancer which was negatively correlated with the stage of tumor and survival time of the patients.",

Our data showed that NDRG2 was increased significantly in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the cells. In vitro invasion and migration assays showed that NDRG2 inhibited migration and invasion of A549 cells. Moreover, the activities of the secreted form of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were decreased, upon overexpression of NDRG2. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study about the effect of NDRG2 on invasion of the lung tumor cell line, suggesting that NDRG2 may act as an anti-invasion factor in lung cancer.",

When the cells are activated by stimulation factors, such as ischemia or hypoxia, NDRG2 is overexpressed and translocated to the nucleus. Thus, it appears that nucleolar localization of NDRG2 observed in our study may be related to the overexpression of NDRG2. This finding is consistent with the results of previous studies which showed the presence of NDRG2 in the cytoplasm and nucleus of other cells (7,12). The presence of nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence is required for translocation of many proteins to the nucleus. NLS sequence has not been shown in the primary structure of NDRG2 and it has been suggested that helix \u03b16 in the structure of NDRG2 may be responsible for its translocation to the nucleus (5).",

The findings of our study revealed that NDRG2 significantly suppressed migration and invasion of A549 cells. Similar results have been reported about the effects of NDRG2 on invasion and migration of prostate (16), breast (25), and hepatocarcinoma (19) cancer cell lines, suggesting the role of NDRG2 as an anti-invasion factor. Degradation of the extracellular matrix by MMPs is required for cancer cell invasion. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are among the most important MMPs which are highly expressed in the lung tumor cells and its expression is correlated with invasiveness of these cells (20). The synthesis and secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 from A549 cells have been previously reported (18). We used SDS-PAGE gelatin zymography to measure the activities of MMP-9 and MMP-2. This technique is based on degradation of gelatin by MMP-9 and MMP-2. It is a repeatable and sensitive method that can detect picogram levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2. Furthermore, it can discriminate between MMP-2 and MMP-9 and their respective pro-enzymes (pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9). Here, we showed a decreased level of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities upon NDRG2 overexpression, suggesting that NDRG2 probably affects cell invasion via inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9. The activities of MMPs can be influenced by several factors including the rate of their expression. We did not evaluate the effect of NDRG2 on MMPs gene expression. It is a limitation of our study; thus, our results should be reconfirmed in studies employing real time PCR in order to define the effect of NDRG2 on MMPs gene expression. Despite this limitation, our results indicate that NDRG2 inhibited the invasion and reduced the activities of MMP-2 and -9.",
