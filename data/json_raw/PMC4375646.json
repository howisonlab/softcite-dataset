            "text": "Objectives: Simultaneous scalp EEG-fMRI can identify hemodynamic changes associated with the generation of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), and it has the potential of becoming a standard, non-invasive technique for pre-surgical assessment of patients with medically intractable epilepsy. This study was designed to assess the BOLD response to focal IEDs recorded via simultaneous intracranial EEG-functional MRI (iEEG-fMRI). Methods: Twelve consecutive patients undergoing intracranial video EEG monitoring were recruited for iEEG-fMRI studies at 3 T. Depth, subdural strip, or grid electrodes were implanted according to our standard clinical protocol. Subjects underwent 10-60 min of continuous iEEG-fMRI scanning. IEDs were marked, and the most statistically significant clusters of BOLD signal were identified (Z-score 2.3, p value b 0.05). We assessed the concordance between the locations of the BOLD response and the IED. Concordance was defined as a distance b1.0 cm between the IED and BOLD response location. Negative BOLD responses were not studied in this project. Results: Nine patients (7 females) with a mean age of 31 years (range 22-56) had 11 different types of IEDs during fMR scanning. The IEDs were divided based on the location of the active electrode contact into mesial temporal, lateral temporal, and extra-temporal. Seven (5 left) mesial temporal IED types were recorded in 5 patients (110-2092 IEDs per spike location). Six of these IEDs had concordant BOLD response in the ipsilateral mesial temporal structures, b1 cm from the most active contact. One of the two subjects with left lateral temporal IEDs had BOLD responses concordant with the location of the most active contact, as well other ipsilateral and contralateral sites. Notably, the remaining two subjects with extratemporal discharges showed no BOLD signal near the active electrode contact. Conclusions: iEEG-fMRI is a feasible and low-risk method for assessment of hemodynamic changes of very focal IEDs that may not be recorded by scalp EEG. A high concordance rate between the location of the BOLD response and IEDs was seen for mesial temporal (6/7) IEDs. Significant BOLD activation was also seen in areas distant from the active electrode and these sites exhibited maximal BOLD activation in the majority of cases. This implies that iEEG-fMRI may further describe the areas involved in the generation of IEDs beyond the vicinity of the electrode(s)."

            "text": "Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) is widely regarded as an effective method for recording epileptic discharges, and is a mainstay in a typical epilepsy unit. Despite its widespread use, however, there are inherent limitations. Scalp EEG primarily records activity of pyramidal neurons near the surface of the brain. Thus, epileptiform activity originating from deep sources is not recorded. In addition, a minimum of 10-20 cm 2 of synchronous, or nearly synchronous activity is required for the detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) with scalp EEG (Tao et al., 2005). Hence, IEDs originating from small regions of epileptogenic cortex are not recorded. Finally, the spatial resolution of scalp EEG is only 22-37 cm 3 when using a routine set of 19 electrodes, and improves to only 6-8 cm 3 when using up to 128 electrodes (Ferree et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The poor spatial resolution of scalp EEG can be mitigated by combining EEG with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Simultaneous EEG-fMRI can also noninvasively evaluate the hemodynamic changes associated with IEDs and has been used successfully for presurgical assessment of patients with medically intractable epilepsy (An et al., 2013;Gotman and Pittau, 2011;Laufs and Duncan, 2007;Moeller et al., 2009;Thornton et al., 2010;Zijlmans et al., 2007). For example, an EEG-fMRI study of 29 patients initially rejected for epilepsy surgery due to inaccurate localization of the seizure focus through standard clinical investigations, identified focal and significant blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses in 15 subjects (Zijlmans et al., 2007). Eight of these 15 subjects had a BOLD response concordant with IED localization. Furthermore, two patients subsequently underwent intracranial EEG (iEEG) monitoring; the BOLD response showed concordance with the ictal onset zone determined by iEEG. One of these patients underwent surgical resection and had a good post-surgical outcome (Engel class II). In another EEG-fMRI study, the BOLD signal from nine non-lesional frontal lobe epilepsy patients was compared to the topography of spikes, and to positron emission tomography and single photon emission computerized tomography results, when available (Moeller et al., 2009). Concordance between IED localization and the location of BOLD response was demonstrated in 8 of the 9 patients. In two cases, reviewing the structural MRI guided by EEG-fMRI data resulted in the consideration of a suspicious, deep sulcus as potential pathology. These two patients subsequently underwent surgical resection and histology confirmed cortical dysplasia in one and microdysgenesis in the other. The EEG-fMRI data had shown activation just adjacent to the resected pathologic area. These studies suggest that scalp EEG-fMRI provides added value as a pre-surgical tool; however, the limitations of scalp EEG3s insensitivity to deep structures and to small regions of epileptogenic cortex remain.",

In combination with fMRI, iEEG thus possesses great clinical potential. With this in mind, our research group recently assessed the risk and feasibility of simultaneous iEEG-fMRI at 3 T in phantoms and epilepsy patients (Boucousis et al., 2012;Cunningham et al., 2012). We found that standard gradient-echo based structural and functional MR protocols did not induce any clinically significant electrode heating, electrode movement, or electrical currents. As such, simultaneous iEEG-fMRI was deemed low-risk by our local ethics and safety committee. Since then, we have been actively using simultaneous iEEG-fMRI for the study of epilepsy patients. In the present study, we assessed the concordance between the location of focal IEDs and the associated BOLD responses recorded with simultaneous iEEG-fMRI.",

Gradient switching artifact was removed using average artifact subtraction, which uses the regularity of the gradient switching induced waveform to generate a moving average artifact that can be successfully removed from the baseline EEG (Allen et al., 2000). Cardioballistic artifact is commonly seen in routine scalp EEG recordings. It is greatly amplified when EEG is recorded in the MR environment because movement of electrically conductive material in a static field results in electromagnetic induction. In contrast, cardioballistic artifact is not seen in routine clinical intracranial EEG records, nor was it seen in our intracranial EEG recordings in the MR environment. Therefore, removal of this artifact was not necessary. The reason why this artifact is not seen in clinical intracranial EEG recordings or in our iEEG-fMRI recordings is that intracranial electrodes (depth or subdural electrodes) are less prone to movement with cardiac pulsations because they are fixed to the skull or dura. Additionally, the distance between the active and reference electrodes is smaller for iEEG than scalp EEG, which further reduces the amplitude of cardioballistic artifact.",

The generated model was imported into FEAT where a time-series statistical analysis was carried out using FILM (FMRIB3s Improved Linear Model) with local autocorrelation correction for each run (Woolrich et al., 2001). Higher-level analyses were performed using a fixed effects model, by forcing the random effects variance to zero in FLAME (FMRIB3s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) (Beckmann et al., 2003;Woolrich et al., 2004;Woolrich, 2008), generating a statistical average of all runs. To account for the increased probability of Type 1 error through the use of multiple HRFs, data were corrected using AlphaSim of the AFNI analysis package http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/AlphaSim.html that performs both probability and cluster-based thresholding at a significance level of p b 0.05, as determined by Monte Carlo simulations (Ward, 2000). Locations of the strongest activation were identified as the cluster (as determined by AlphaSim) with maximum peak response (Z-score). The gamma function time-to-peak for each subject3s maximal response was used. Parametric maps were overlaid onto highresolution structural images that were registered to MNI standard space.",

            "text": "Second, significant BOLD activation was seen in all 9 (out of a total of 12) patients in whom interpretable EEG was obtained. Previous scalp EEG-fMRI studies detected BOLD responses associated with IEDs in 50-60% and 60-70% of patients studied with spike-triggered or continuous EEG-fMRI, respectively (Mulert and Lemieux, 2009). Other research groups have shown that the yield of scalp EEG-fMRI can be increased to 80-100% by performing convolutions using multiple hemodynamic response functions peaking at 3, 5, 7, and 9 s (Kobayashi et al., 2006a;Kobayashi et al., 2006b;Pittau et al., 2012). Following the success of this analytical approach, we employed a multiple HRF model for our analyses that may in part, explain the high yield from the present study. Another possible explanation may be the high number of epileptiform discharges that were analyzed in our subjects (range 37-2611, mean 857 \u00b1 286). The nature of intracranial EEG also offers the advantage of recording of epileptiform activity without attenuation by the dura, skull, and scalp, which has been theorized to act as a physiological signal filter that allows only the IEDs of the greatest amplitude, which recruit large areas of the cortex, to be visible on scalp EEG (Tao et al., 2005). Additionally, seemingly spike-free periods seen on scalp EEG-fMRI may have IEDs that cannot be detected by scalp EEG. The presence of these unrecorded discharges could contaminate the baseline BOLD signal used for statistical comparison to the periods of spiking by the fMRI general linear model (GLM). Intracranial EEG-fMRI circumvents this limitation; however, it offers limited sampling of the brain that is dependent on the placement of intracranial EEG electrodes. Three EEG datasets, performed early in this project, were deemed uninterpretable due to persistent artifact, attributed to insufficient grounding of the EEG signal by the 20-electrode connector, and a lack of synchronization between the internal clocks of the MRI and EEG systems. We have experienced no further losses of data (2011 to present) since subsequently using a new 64-electrode connector and an MRIto-EEG clock synchronizer (Compumedics NeuroScan).",

The highest concordance was seen with mesial temporal lobe epileptiform discharges, with 6 of the 7 patients (86%) showing good concordance. The remaining patient (subject 5) with mesial temporal discharges had an ipsilateral occipital BOLD response without any temporal BOLD signal. Interestingly, this patient had a poor postsurgical outcome. It would therefore be tempting to speculate that the lack of a significant BOLD response in the intended surgical target should prompt a search for an ictal onset zone elsewhere in the brain, particularly where the BOLD response was seen, which in this case, was not covered by intracranial EEG electrodes. However, the poor concordance in this case may also be partly related to significant BOLD signal loss in the temporal region due to susceptibility artifact resulting from a combination of a high number of temporal electrodes and a large amount of patient motion (N20 mm) during the scanning session limiting the amount of analyzable data collected."

Furthermore, the criteria used to measure concordance in the present study, b1.0 cm between the IED and BOLD response location, is stricter than previously published work that used b2.0 cm between area of interest (resection margin) and BOLD response as selection for good concordance (An et al., 2013).",

The lack of concordance in the extra temporal patients may also highlight an inability to fully localize the ictal onset zone using clinical data (iEEG VEM, MR, positron emission tomography, single photon emission computerized tomography, etc.) as can occur in focal cortical dysplasia, for example (Cendes, 2013). Indeed, it is possible that the intracranial EEG electrodes were not placed at the center of the irritative zone, but instead were placed at the edge. Thus, the site of maximum BOLD activation seen in these subjects may in fact be the center of the irritative zone, where electrodes were not placed, and possibly, should have been placed. Consistent with our findings, the subjects with extratemporal IEDs were not offered surgery since ictal iEEG recordings failed to identify the seizure onset zone. As previous work has shown, scalp EEG-fMRI may sometimes provide additional data to direct subsequent clinical investigations that can improve patient post-surgical outcomes (Zijlmans et al., 2007). We feel that iEEG-fMRI may have a similar function.",

In fact, the cluster with maximum BOLD response was found to be distant rather than adjacent to the active electrode in 8 out of 11 datasets (contralateral in 3). We hypothesize that this may be a result of EPI signal loss due to the susceptibility artifact associated with the intracranial electrodes. Indeed, as discussed in our previous work detailing the susceptibility artifact associated with iEEG-fMRI (Boucousis et al., 2012), T2* signal intensity can be decreased up to 40% within 1.5 cm of the intracranial electrode; at a distance 2.0 cm from the electrode, signal loss is negligible. This decrease in signal-to-noise ratio may have negatively impacted the statistical analyses performed on these data (Parrish et al., 2000), leading to an underestimation of the strength of activation immediately adjacent to the site of the active intracranial electrode contact.",

Unilateral temporal discharges (mesial and neocortical) were associated with BOLD activation in ipsilateral mesial temporal structures, ipsilateral basal ganglia, bilateral neocortical temporal regions and in the contralateral temporal lobe. The observed patterns of BOLD activation did not show a correlation with the location of the discharges or with the presence or absence of a lesion. Comparison of this study to ours is challenging, especially for our mesial temporal subjects, since strictly mesial temporal discharges cannot be recorded on scalp EEG; instead, these discharges reflect simultaneous involvement of the mesial and neocortical temporal lobes. Despite this, we observed similar widespread patterns of BOLD activation involving mesial and neocortical temporal and extra-temporal sites. The small number of patients in our study, combined with patient heterogeneity does not allow any conclusions or associations to be made between the underlying lesion type or location of discharge with the pattern of BOLD activation. One notable exception, however, was subject 2, who had nonlesional independent bitemporal lobe seizures and independent mesial temporal lobe discharges. This subject, unlike all the other patients in our study, had very focal BOLD signal increases that were maximal and adjacent to the active electrode. The reasons for this unique pattern of BOLD activation are unclear as there appear to be no clear clinical, EEG, or MR imaging characteristics that differentiate this subject from the others in our study.",

This may also apply to extra-temporal epileptiform discharges, explaining the BOLD responses in distant areas. In our study, 3 patients had a maximum BOLD response near the location of the active electrode. In the remaining, the maximum BOLD response was distant to the active electrode even though a significant BOLD response was seen at the active electrode. This might suggest that the spike generator is distant from the active electrode. However, we feel that this is not the case for several reasons: First, the limited intracranial electrode recording field makes it very unlikely that recorded spikes originated from a distant active electrode. Second, clinical recordings of seizures confirmed that the ictal onset zone included the active electrodes used in our iEEG-fMRI analyses (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, three of our subjects had resections that included the active electrode contact and they are now seizure-free. Lastly, susceptibility artifact is present in the immediate vicinity of intracranial EEG electrodes (Table 2) which results in attenuation of the BOLD signal in up to 20 mm of cortex adjacent to the active electrode(s) (Boucousis et al., 2012;Cunningham et al., 2012).

These include the ability to study very focal or low amplitude epileptiform discharges not recordable by scalp EEG (e.g., IEDs that do not require N10 cm 2 of cortical surface activity) or discharges originating from deep structures such as mesial temporal structures or the cingulate gyrus. More importantly, iEEG-fMRI opens a new avenue for a better understanding of the hemodynamic response to epileptiform discharges by affording the opportunity to study very focal discharges with great precision or for further mapping the seizure network by providing information that could be complementary to routine clinical investigations such as EEG, structural MRI, PET, and SPECT (An et al., 2013;Gotman and Pittau, 2011;Laufs and Duncan, 2007;Moeller et al., 2009;Thornton et al., 2010;Zijlmans et al., 2007). Although ictal EEG and high frequency oscillations are better markers of the epileptogenic zone than IEDs, IEDs still provide useful clinical information about the irritative zone, which often includes the ictal onset zone. Therefore, iEEG-fMRI may provide a better understanding of the irritative zone and consequently the ictal onset zone because it can delineate the irritative zone with greater spatial resolution than iEEG alone, which provides limited sampling of the brain. Lastly, intracranial EEG-fMRI may allow the study of the hemodynamic response to high frequency oscillations.",

We also demonstrated high yield and concordance rates of BOLD responses to interictal epileptiform discharges of mesial temporal discharges. Notably, however, most datasets (8/11) showed maximal BOLD signal at locations distant to the most active electrode contact. Intracranial EEG-fMRI may provide useful data to help better understand the functional networks generating interictal discharges in focal epilepsy."
