From an RBC model with recursive utility, I show that it is not the degree of relative risk aversion, but the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), that governs the movements of the variables of the model in the log linearized environment. The Bayesian estimation results based on Korean data from the period 1987 to 2013 suggest that there are some elements of success in describing the Korean economy based on the simple RBC model both with the EIS larger than one and with an error term for the real interest rate equation. An EIS larger than one improves the performance of the simple RBC model mainly in the direction of raising the volatility of consumption relative to output. Simulation results show that the error term for the real interest rate process mostly reflects the endogenous channel of financial frictions where the domestic real interest rate depends negatively on the expected (transitory) productivity shock.",

It is well known that the degree of relative risk aversion equals the inverse of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS hereafter) in the CRRA utility function, and they are not disentangled. If we stick to the conventional interpretation of the CRRA utility function, and if we set the degree of relative risk aversion at two to four, commonly used in the literature, we have a situation where the discount factor is greater than one in the Korean data. Specifically, as I show in Section 3, the CRRA utility function implies that the real interest rate (1 + r) in the steady state equals g \u03b3 /\u03b2, where \u03b3 denotes the degree of relative risk aversion, and g represents the steady state value of the (gross) growth rate. Put differently, \u03b2 = g \u03b3 /(1 + r). Unless the mean growth rate is far less than the steady state value of the real interest rate, \u03b2 (the discount factor) is greater than one. Unfortunately in the Korean data, the mean growth rate of real GDP is slightly less than the highest measure of the mean real interest rate for the sample period. 2 Therefore, we should fix \u03b3 at one in order to have \u03b2 less than one, if we stick to the conventional interpretation of the CRRA utility function. Even in this case, \u03b2 turns out to be 0.9985 in the Korean data, which is virtually one.",

Log linearization of the model with recursive utility shows that it is not the degree of relative risk aversion but the elasticity of intertemporal substitution that governs the movements of the log linearized system of the model. It is the EIS that governs the movements of the stochastic discount factor. The steady state value of the real interest rate and all the log linearized equations are governed by the EIS-not by the measure of relative risk aversion. This means that the RBC model with recursive utility is seemingly equivalent to the same model with the CRRA utility function in the log linearized environment. However, the interpretation of the model parameter \u03b3 , the degree of relative risk aversion in the CRRA utility function, might be different: it represents not the degree of relative risk aversion but the inverse of the EIS. This allows us to set \u03b3 , conventionally interpreted as the meaure of relative risk aversion, to a value less than one, implying an EIS greater than one. 3 I calibrate a model based on Korean data for the period 1987-2013 and do a Bayesian estimation of the model. The estimation and simulation results suggest that it is fair to say that a simple RBC model both with the EIS greater than one and with an error term for the real interest rate equation can reasonably explain the business cycle stylized facts in the Korean economy despite its simplicity. It explains the excess volatility of consumption relative to output. The simulated volatility of consumption relative to output is 1.22, and close to the actual number from the data, 1.25. It also shows a weak countercyclicality (or acyclicality) of the real interest rate.",

For example, AG's Table 2B reports that the volatility of consumption relative to output is 1.23 in the case of Korea. However, it is worthwhile to note that consumption is not always more volatile than output throughout the AG's sample period (79:IV-03:II). The excess volatility of consumption relative to output is due to the fact that consumption is more volatile than output only for the latter part of the sample, the 1990s and 2000s. More specifically, the volatility of consumption relative to output is 0.82 (0.85) for the sample period between 79:IV and 86:IV (95:IV). It increases and becomes higher than one as the latter part of the sample is included. 4 Figure 1 shows log GDP per capita and log consumption per capita in Korea for the period 1970:I-2013:IV, for which official GDP data published by the Bank of Korea are available. The source of the data will be discussed in Subsection 4.1. Log GDP per capita and log consumption per capita are HP-filtered with a smoothing parameter of 1600. One thing we have to note in Figure 1 is that consumption is no longer more volatile than output for the sample period as a whole. The volatility of consumption relative to output is 0.88. However, when the sample covers the period between 87:I (93:I) and 13:IV, it rises to 1.25 (1.33). 5 This fact suggests that we would best use a shorter sample rather than the whole sample as far as the Korean data are concerned in examining whether RBC models can explain the stylized facts in emerging-economy business cycles such as excess volatility of consumption relative to output. Another reason we should use a shorter rather than the whole sample is that we have little official data on interest rates, reflecting market conditions until the 1990s. Almost no official interest rate data are available for the earlier part of the sample. The Bank of Korea does not publish interest rate data for the earlier period, mainly because both deposit and lending interest rates were controlled by the government and do not reflect market conditions. One interest rate that provides the longest series and, at the same time, reflects market conditions is the rate for AA-rated corporate bonds [CB(AA-)], and data on this interest rate are available only since 1987.",

Figure 2 shows the growth rates of total factor productivity (TFP) for the period 1971-2011 and the averages of TFP growth rates for each business cycle reported in Table 1. Growth rates of TFP fluctuate a lot and the average of TFP growth rates falls below zero during the second (75:II-80:III) and sixth (93:I-98:III) business cycles. The fall in the second business cycle seems to be related to the first and second oil shocks and the fall in the sixth business cycle seems to be related to the occurrence of the Asian currency crisis in 1997. After the first fall, the average TFP growth rate goes up and fluctuates around 0.26% during the third to fifth business cycles. After the second fall, it continuously increases from 0.17% during the seventh cycle to 0.44% during the tenth business cycle. Thus, there appear to be about five trend cycles for the whole sample for which official national accounting data are available and three trend cycles for the shorter sample (87:I-11:IV) in terms of the average growth rates of TFP. 6",

Other things equal, the lower the steady state value of the real interest rate, the higher the discount factor. Thus we need a measure of the real interest rate that is large relative to the steady state value of the mean (gross) growth rate, g, in order to avoid a situation where the discount factor \u03b2 is larger than one. Figure 3 plots the real interest rate in Korea for the sample period 1987:I-2013:IV. In the figure, the real interest rate is calculated as the difference between the nominal interest rate for AA-rated corporate bonds [CB(AA-)] and the four-quarter moving average of the GDP deflator inflation rates. This choice is restricted by the availability of data for the sample and the representativeness of market conditions. This measure of the real interest rate fluctuates between 6% and 13% during the first half of the sample and peaks in the second quarter of 1998, during which time the IMF and the Korean government agreed to switch from a high-interest-rate policy to a more modest interest-rate policy. After that it tends to go down and stays below 4% for most of the period, except for the credit crunch in 2002 and the initial stage of the financial crisis in 2008. The average annual real interest rate is 5.47% for the sample period.",

The most commonly accepted values for \u03b3 range from two to four in the business cycle research. It is thought to be much larger than that if our main focus is on explaining movements in financial variables. The fact that the sample mean of the real interest rate is relatively low in Korea restricts the choice of the value for \u03b3 to one or less. More specifically, the average quarterly (gross) growth rate of GDP per capita, g, for the sample is 1.0122, and the average quarterly gross real interest rate, 1 +r, is 1.0137. If the exponent of the preference, \u03b3 , equals two, then the discount factor (\u03b2) calculated from equation 18is 1.01 and is larger than one. Thus, I need to fix the parameter \u03b3 at one or a value less than one in order not to have the discount factor be larger than one and to let \u03b2 be determined at the level that satisfies the steady state equilibrium condition (18). Even in the case of \u03b3 = 1, \u03b2 turns out to be 0.9985. This is virtually one.",

The reason I do not consider the labor market in this paper is that it is known that the simple RBC model with a growth shock presented in Subsection 3.1 does not satisfactorily explain the stylized facts in emerging-economy labor markets: large fluctuations in wages and subdued fluctuations in employment. Refer to Bahng (2012) and Boz et al. (2012) for the detailed discussions and references therein. Another reason I do not include work hours in the utility function is to remove the interaction between consumption and labor. If the period utility depends nonseparably on both consumption and labor, the marginal utility of consumption depends on labor. Furthermore, even if consumption and labor are separable in the period utility, the stochastic discount factor is affected by labor through the value function for the next period, V t+1 , as noted in Dew-Becker (2014).",

First, the excess volatility of consumption relative to output is not a prominent phenomenon in Korean business cycles before the Asian currency crisis of 1997. The volatility of consumption relative to output for the period 1970-1995 is just 0.51. Consumption was much smoother than output for the period, as it is in advanced economies. Second, the Korean government liberalized the financial market in the early 1990s and has let the interest rate be determined in the market step by step since 1992. Before then, interest rates were controlled by the government. The longest market interest rate series that the Bank of Korea officially publishes is the rate for AA-rated corporate bonds; this series has been available since January 1987. Third, the period includes two crises: the Asian currency crisis in 1997 and the global financial crisis in 2008. The two crises contributed to the excess volatility of consumption relative to output. 7 For the sample period, the average quarterly growth rate (g) of real GDP net of government spending in Korea is set to 1.2%. The average quarterly net real interest rate (r) for the sample period is set to 1.4%. Real interest rates are constructed as the difference between the AA-corporate bond yields (series 4.2.2.1) and the four-quarter moving average of the GDP deflator inflation rate (series 10.4.3.2). I set the capital coefficient at \u03b1 = 0.4, based on the fact that the labor income share (series 10.1.1) in the Korean economy, measured as the ratio of compensation for employees to GDP for the period 1987 to 2013, fluctuates around 60%. I set the depreciation rate at \u03b4 = 0.025, implying an annual depreciation rate of 10%, which is commonly used in the literature. I set the steady state value of the trade balance (tb)-to-GDP ratio (tby) to 0%, which is based on the sample mean of \u22120.03%.",

I set the prior distribution for the AR(1) parameters for the shock process as a beta distribution, and the parameters with positive values as a gamma distribution. 8 I set the prior distribution for the standard deviation of shock processes and the measurement errors for g Y , g C , g I , TBY, and r as an inverse gamma distribution. I set the prior mean of the EIS at 2.3, which is close to the values used in the literature. For example, Tallarini (2000) and Piazzesi and Schneider (2006) set \u03c8 at 1, and Bansal and Yaron (2004) set it at 1.5. Chen et al. (2013) estimate it to be \u2248 2, and Binsbergen et al. (2012) estimate it to be 1.72. Table 3 reports the key moments simulated from the estimation. In Table 2, I set the prior mean of the EIS (\u03c8) at 2.3 in the case of the model with RU, whereas I implicitly set it to unity in the case of the model with the CRRA utility function, because it equals the inverse of \u03b3 . The log data density from the model with the CRRA utility function is 1,454 and that from the model with RU is 1,386. This implies that the overall performance of the model with the CRRA utility function is slightly better than that of the model with RU. However, the adoption of an EIS greater than one improves the performance of the simple RBC model at least in one important direction. It primarily raises the volatility of consumption relative to output. A higher EIS implies larger fluctuations in expected consumption growth given fluctuations in real interest rates. As far as the other second-order moments are concerned, the model with an EIS of unity performs better in explaining the correlations of investment with output, and both the autocorrelations of the trade balance and the real interest rate. 9 Having an EIS greater than one is a controversial issue in macroeconomics. The 90% confidence interval of the EIS, \u03c8, ranges from 2.28 to 2.32. This interval does not include one. If the 90% confidence interval includes one, we cannot strongly exclude the possibility of the EIS being one. This is indirect evidence that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the EIS should be greater than one in order to explain Korean business cycles. In sum, we can say that there are, to say the least, some elements of success in describing the Korean economy based on the simple RBC model both with EIS larger than one and with an error term for the interest rate process. It explains the relative volatility between consumption (investment) and output rather well. In addition, it can explain the acyclicality or the weak countercyclicality of the real interest rate.",

This means that the trend component explains a small fraction (about 6% ) of the movements of output. Table 4 reports the variance decomposition of the RBC model with RU. From the variance decomposition, we can confirm that most fluctuations of output are due to the transitory technology shock. However, fluctuations in consumption and investment are affected by both transitory and growth components. It is also noticeable that most of the fluctuations in the trade balance and the real interest rates are due to the error term for the interest rate process, \u03b5 r . Thus, we can say that different shocks are responsible for the movements of different variables. Then what is the error term for the interest rate process, \u03b5 r ? In order to answer this question, I turn to discussions of models with financial frictions. Neumeyer and Perri (2005), Yue (2006), Garcia-Cicco et al. (2010), and Chang and Fernandez (2013), among others, argue that the AG-type model supplemented with financial frictions does a better job of explaining the stylized facts in emerging-economy business cycles.

It may stem from financial imperfections, which lead to stochastic shifts in the country premium that are uncorrelated with the state of domestic fundamentals such as a t and g t . Among the various types of financial frictions, I report only the case of the endogenous risk premium channel in Table 5. The exogenous risk premium channel cannot be differentiated from the baseline model with an error term for the real interest rate process, so the estimation results turn out not to be qualitatively different. Table 5 reports the log data density, the key moments simulated from the estimation, and the variance decompositon of the RBC model with the endogenous risk premium channel. 11 The log data density is 1,430, which is in between the model with the CRRA utility function and the model with RU. Compared with the RBC model with RU, the RBC model with the endogenous risk premium channel better explains the autocorrelations of each variable and the correlations of each variable with output except the correlation of r and y. The RBC model with the endogenous risk premium channel implies a too strong countercyclicality of the real interest rate. If we compare the variance decompostions reported in Tables 4 and 5, the contribution of \u03b5 r in explaining the movements of each variable becomes significantly smaller in Table 5, where I take the endogenous risk premium channel into consideration. It is almost negligible except the case of r, where \u03b5 r still explains about 38% of the movements in r. Table 5 implies that \u03b5 r represents mostly the endogenous risk premium channel reflected in equation 30. As a result, the contribution of the transitory productivity shock, \u03b5 A , in explaining the movements of each variable significantly increases.",

They do not use the real interest rate data in the estimation, whereas I use them as one of the observed variables in the estimation of the Korean economy. It is because the original motivation of this paper is to explain the excess volatility of consumption relative to output combined with both a relatively large mean growth rate of output and low real interest rates in Korea.

Table 6 reports the key second moments simulated from the estimation. As the EIS becomes larger, or equivalently, the parameter \u03b3 becomes smaller, the correlation between the output growth and the trade balance to output ratio (tby) becomes more negative, the volatility of tby becomes smaller, and the correlation between consumption (investment) growth and tby becomes more negative. There are no significant changes in the volatilities and autocorrelations of variables: g Y , g C , g I . This can be explained as follows: As the EIS becomes larger, consumption fluctuates more to smooth consumption, and the trade balance tends to move more in the direction opposite to output. This makes both the correlation between output growth and tby and the correlation between consumption (investment) growth and tby more negative. However, a higher EIS does not lead to the increased volatility  Tables 2 and 3 of Garcia-Cicco et al. (2010).",

(2011) show that taking the stochastic steady state into consideration may improve the performance of a model, especially in welfare and/or portfolio decision analyses. They explicitly define the risky steady state as \"the point where agents choose to stay at a given date if they expect future risk and if the realizations of shocks is zero at this date.\" Thus, I examine whether considering the risky steady state can be an alternative to the EIS being larger than one in the log linearized model with the CRRA utility function in explaining the excess volatility of consumption relative to output in emerging-economy business cycles. 12 It is not clear whether taking the risky steady state into account will increase the volatility of consumption relative to output. Let us suppose that there is a positive income shock. The more persistent the shock is, the more consumption will increase. It will exacerbate the trade balance and increase foreign borrowing and the risk premium. A higher risk premium will then discourage foreign borrowing and stabilize consumption. At the same time, the risky steady state leads to a precautionary motive for savings. The precautionary motive for savings will reduce consumption in the risky steady state. Thus, it is difficult to say a priori whether considering the risky steady state will increase the volatility of consumption relative to output.",

However, their main focus is on Latin American economies such as Mexico and Argentina. This paper explicitly focuses on describing and estimating the Korean economy. In order to do that, I incorporated a recursive utility into an AG-type RBC model in order to circumvent a situation where the discount factor becomes larger than one when the Korean economy is calibrated. This situation is due to the fact that the sample mean of the real interest rate is relatively low and the sample mean growth rate is relatively large. Recursive utility allows us to separate the degree of relative risk aversion from the EIS. The log linearization of the model with recursive utility shows that it is not the degree of relative risk aversion but the EIS that governs the movements of the variables in the model. This makes room for setting \u03b3 , conventionally interpreted as the degree of relative risk aversion in the case of the CRRA utility function, to be less than one, because it can be now interpreted as the inverse of the EIS. It also suggests that the model with the CRRA utility function, combined with \u03b3 less than one, can produce the same results as the model with recursive utility where the EIS is larger than one.",

It also shows acyclicality or a weak countercyclicality of the real interest rate observed in the Korean data.

I call this the endogenous risk premium channel. Simulation results suggest that the error term for the real interest rate process mostly reflects the endogenous risk premium channel.

Unfortunately, the results are not encouraging. A higher EIS does not lead to the increased volatility of consumption relative to output (or the volatility of consumption growth) in the Argentine data. It may be because Garcia-Cicco et al. (2010)'s parameterization and estimation are best suited to explaining the second moments of the growth variables. The volatility of consumption relative to output depends not only on the EIS but also on the other parameters such as \u03c1 A , \u03c1 g , and \u03c6. Another possibility is that the estimation does not include the real interest rate data as one of the observed variables, whereas I include it as one of the observed variables in the case of Korea. Or it may be because of something else. Unfortunately, I do not have the answer to this issue and leave it for future research.",
