We use Bayesian statistical techniques that allow one to select from a large set of candidates those variables most likely to be determinants of FDI activity. The variables with consistently high inclusion probabilities include traditional gravity variables, cultural distance factors, relative labour endowments and trade agreements. There is little support for multilateral trade openness, most host-country business costs, host-country infrastructure and host-country institutions.

Many previous studies of cross-country FDI activity have used a gravity equation, which controls mainly for the economic size of the parent and host countries, the geographic distance separating the countries and proxies for certain economic frictions. Like trade flows, this specification does a reasonably good job of fitting the observed data, but leaves one wondering if such a parsimonious specification captures all relevant factors.",

These studies point out a number of modifications to a standard gravity model that may be necessary to accurately explain FDI patterns. First, while gravity variables may adequately capture \"horizontal\" motivations for FDI, where firms look to replicate their operations in other countries to be more proximate to consumers in those markets, additional controls are necessary to allow for \"vertical\" motivations of FDI, where firms look for low-cost locations for labour-intensive production. For example, these studies introduce measures of relative labour endowments in the host country with the expectation that countries with relatively high shares of unskilled labour will be attractive locations for MNEs due to lower wages. In addition, these studies show that FDI decisions by MNEs are complex enough that interactions between key variables (e.g., GDP and skilled labour endowments) may be necessary to account for nonlinear effects of these variables on FDI patterns. Head and Ries (2008) differs from these previous studies by modelling FDI as arising from decisions by firms to acquire and control foreign assets (i.e., cross-border mergers and acquisitions), rather than development of new (or greenfield) plants. Their analysis of FDI patterns highlights the potential role of common culture and language between countries.",

From a Bayesian perspective, incorporating such uncertainty is conceptually straightforward. The choice of covariates, or \"model,\" is treated as an additional parameter that lies in the space of potential models, which allows us to compute the posterior probability that each potential model is the true model that generated the data. Posterior distributions for objects of interest, such as the effect of a particular covariate, are then averaged across alternative models, using the posterior model probabilities as weights. This procedure, known as Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), produces inferences that are not conditioned on a particular model.",

In our application, we have a large set of potential covariates, which yields an extremely large set of possible models (> 7 \u00d7 10 16 ). To sidestep this difficulty, we use techniques designed to obtain random draws of models from the probability distribution defined by the posterior model probabilities. Such draws are made possible even when the posterior model probabilities are unknown by using the MC 3 algorithm of Madigan and York (1995). These random model draws are then used to construct estimates of the posterior model probabilities. 2 Our set of potential FDI determinants is meant to be comprehensive and includes a combination of covariates proposed by the previously mentioned studies, as well as other prior literature on FDI. We examine mainly crosssectional patterns for the year 2000. 2 We examine both levels and log-linear regressions, placing more weight on our results for the log-linear regressions because most previous studies have used a logarithmic transformation to address skewness in the FDI variable. We also examine three measures of FDI-FDI stock, affiliate sales and cross-border mergers and acquisitions activity-in order to better compare with a broader set of prior studies. At the end, we also explore a specification that first differences observations across the years 1990 and 2000 to control for bilateral country-pair fixed effects as well as a negative binomial specification to better model the nature of our dependent variable.",

However, there are a number of major differences. Both of these prior papers focus on determinants of FDI flows, whereas our focus is on the (static) cross-country distribution of FDI, typically measured by FDI stock or affiliate sales. This is an important distinction. Examination of FDI flows has been the purview of primarily the international finance literature, where the role of exchange rates, capital market shocks and short-run changes to other financial variables are the focus. In contrast, we wish to inform the empirical FDI literature that has focused on stock measures of FDI in order to directly assess the main general equilibrium theories of the long-run factors that explain the distribution FDI across countries. General equilibrium predictions are static in nature and therefore pertain to levels, not (short-run) changes, of the variables of interest. An additional focus of these papers is on modeling the selection issue of whether there is any FDI activity between bilateral country pairs in the first place. Since almost all prior empirical FDI studies do not address this issue, and our primary focus is on comparing our BMA results directly with these prior studies, we do not explore this issue either.",

In words, the marginal likelihood function is the likelihood function integrated with respect to the researcher's prior density function. It thus has the interpretation of the average value of the likelihood function, and therefore the average fit of the model, over different parameter values, where the averaging is done with respect to the prior density of model parameters. The posterior model probabilities in (2) can be used to confront the model uncertainty present in the FDI determinants regression. One approach for using Pr M j |Y is to select the model with highest posterior probability and then make inferences about the effects of alternative FDI determinants based on this \"best\" model alone. However, this focus on one chosen model (which mimics much of the model selection literature based on hypothesis tests and information criteria) ignores information in models other than the chosen model and thus does not yield inferences that fully incorporate model uncertainty.

From (2) and(3), calculation of these probabilities requires a choice for both the prior density function for the parameters of M j , p \u03b1, \u03b2 j , \u03c3 |M j and the prior model probability, Pr M j , j = 1, ..., R. In this section, we describe how each of these priors are set in our study of FDI determinants. In BMA applications, specification of the prior parameter densities poses a significant challenge. One approach is to elicit prior densities for the parameters of each model individually. However, this becomes intractable when the space of potential models is large, as will be true for the FDI determinants model. In such cases, it is useful to use prior parameter densities that are \"automatic,\" in that they are set in a formulaic way across alternative models. One simple, and seemingly attractive, way to do this is to use non-informative priors for the parameters of all models under consideration. Unfortunately, the use of non-informative priors for those parameters not common to all models will yield posterior model probabilities that mechanically favour models with fewer parameters over those with more. For our application, the slope parameters \u03b2 j are not common to all models, as they depend on the set of variables included in X j . Thus, using noninformative priors for \u03b2 j is not an option, as it will paradoxically generate model comparison results that are solely a consequence of the prior. This is not the case for parameters that are common to all models, for which non-informative priors yield posterior model probabilities that are not a function of the prior but only of sample information. For this reason, non-informative priors are a popular choice for parameters common to all models.",

This approach relies on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which can be used to provide random samples from any probability distribution provided it is known up to a proportionality constant, which, by inspection of (2), is true for Pr M j |Y . MC 3 was implemented by Raftery, Madigan and Hoeting (1997) for BMA in linear regression models and has been used in a number of economic applications involving linear regression (e.g., Fernandez, Ley andSteel 2001a, 2001b). 9 The MC 3 algorithm requires an arbitrary model to initialize the sequence of model draws. Given this initial model, model draws obtained from the algorithm form a Markov chain that converges to draws from Pr M j |Y . An important issue with such Markov-chain based samplers is assessing the convergence of the chain. In producing the results described in section 5 below, we assume that 200,000 draws is sufficient to ensure convergence and then base our estimates of posterior model probabilities on 1 million additional draws. We performed three checks to ensure convergence of the sampling procedure. First, results from an independent simulation using a longer convergence sample of 400,000 draws were very similar to those based on the shorter convergence sample. Second, our results are insensitive to two widely dispersed initial models: one with no FDI determinants and one with all possible FDI determinants. This insensitivity of results to the size of the convergence sample and the initialization of the chain suggests the sampler has converged. Finally, FLS suggest using the correlation between the probability estimates based on (11) and (12) as a check on the convergence of the sampler. For all results we present, this correlation was above 0.99.",

In addition, there is no common source for FDI data; prior studies have therefore employed a number of different measures of FDI. As we wish to compare our results to these prior studies, we have collected data on three different FDI measures typically used. Our first source of cross-country FDI activity is bilateral FDI stocks reported by members of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is the most comprehensive source of reliable data on total FDI stocks that we are aware of. 10 OECD provides excellent coverage of FDI activity between OECD countries. It also has some coverage of FDI between OECD and non-OECD countries, though many transactions with small non-OECD countries are missing. OECD does not report any observations of FDI between countries where they are both non-OECD. The FDI stock data will be the benchmark measure of FDI used in our study, but we will also compare and contrast our results when using two alternative measures of FDI activity, described next.",

Unfortunately, affiliate sales data are much less available than FDI stock data. To our knowledge, Braconier, Norback and Urban (2005;BNU) have collected the most extensive database of cross-country affiliate sales and have graciously provided it to us. Their database provides information on outward affiliate sales involving 56 parent countries and 85 host countries over roughly four years from the late 1980s to 1998. Despite this, the number of observations is much smaller than with the FDI stock data. 11 Finally, we employ data on cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that have been used in such studies as Rossi and Volpin (2004) and Head and Ries (2008). These data come from Thomsen's SDC Platinum database on M&A activity, meant to be a comprehensive census of worldwide M&A above the $1 million threshold since the early 1990s. While this level of country coverage in the M&A data clearly dominates the other two measures of FDI activity, the M&A measure also has relative disadvantages. First, it measures only one type of FDI, though M&A does account for the majority of worldwide FDI activity. Second, because many of the transactions are between private firms, over half of the M&A in the database do not have any recorded value. Thus, we rely on counts of the number of M&A occurring between country pairs. 12 More specifically, we use cumulated sums of counts of prior and current-year M&A by country pair to create a measure analogous to cross-country FDI stocks. Head and Ries (2008) also use cumulated measures of M&A activity and find a quite high correlation (greater than 0.80) between the FDI stock and M&A measures of FDI activity.",

To account for such spatial features of the data to some extent, we include a remoteness variable for both the host and parent country, constructed as the distance-weighted average of all other countries' GDP. Possible agglomeration effects within countries also led us to add a measure of urban concentration for both the host and parent country. Previous studies have hypothesized that endowments may matter, particularly if FDI is motivated to find lower cost locations (i.e., vertically motivated FDI). However, these studies have included only measures of relative labour and capital endowments. We include measures of land and oil as well. Business costs in the host country have been included in some previous studies, but they often use proxies that have limited country coverage, which we found significantly reduces the potential sample. Thus, we rely on relatively recent measures of host-country business costs collected by the World Bank that measure the average time it takes to enforce a contract, register property, start a business and resolve an insolvency.

Note that interactive variables drop out of the log-levels specifications as they generate perfect collinearity in the regression upon taking logarithms. For each potential covariate, table 3 reports the posterior inclusion probability and the mean of the BMA posterior density for the covariate's slope coefficient for both the levels (columns 1 and 2) and log-levels (columns 3 and 4) specifications using our sample of 2000 data. Again, the posterior inclusion probability and mean of the BMA posterior distribution are computed as in equations (13) and (14), respectively. One striking similarity between the levels and log-levels specifications is the relatively small set of variables out of the 56 potential covariates that have high inclusion probabilities. Only seven variables have inclusion probabilities at or above 50% in the levels specification, while the analogous number of variables is 16 in the log-levels specification.

In addition, the trade openness variables indicating the presence of a custom union, the presence of a regional trade agreement and host-country country openness, all have inclusion values above 90%. There is also evidence that endowment differences across the host and parent country may matter, as predicted by some models of FDI, such as the knowledge-capital model of CMM (2001). The host-country skill level and the squared skill difference between the host and parent country have high inclusion probabilities, though all other endowment variables (including those capturing capital and land differences) have very low inclusion probabilities. 14 In general, other broad categories of variables receive little statistical support, particularly those related to business costs, infrastructure and institutions in the host country. The exception is some support for legal institutions (85%) and the corporate tax level (67%) in the host country. On the other hand, there are a few variables not typically included in empirical FDI studies that have very high inclusion probability in our log-levels specification. These are real GDP per capita in the parent country (100%), remoteness of the host country (100%) and, to a lesser extent, urban concentration of the host country (52%). Our results to this point use FDI stock as our measure of cross-country FDI activity. Table 4 next compares results when we use two other measures of FDI that have been used by prior studies-affiliate sales and cross-border M&A activity. The table displays all variables that receive at least 50% in one of our three specifications (FDI stock, affiliate sales or M&A). For ease in reading the table, we bold the instances where the inclusion probability is 50% or higher. For comparison sake, we report only the results for the log-levels specification, and, for the M&A sample, we use only observations for the 1,066 country pairs for which we observe the FDI stock variable. (We have many more country-pair observations for the M&A sample that we will analyze and discuss below.) We use all observations available for affiliate sales, but this provides just 395 observations.",

First, the traditional gravity variables (real GDP of both countries and distance) all have inclusion probabilities of 100% across all three specifications. Parent-country real GDP per capita also has at least a 99% inclusion probability across all three, suggesting that the wealth of the source country is a key determinant of FDI. Interestingly, host country real GDP per capita does not have similarly high inclusion probabilities. There is a similar asymmetry in that host country remoteness generally garners high inclusion probabilities across all the measures of FDI activity, whereas parent country remoteness does not. It has a high inclusion probability only in the cross-border M&A specification. These asymmetric results are an example of empirical patterns our analysis finds that have not been examined by prior theory or empirical studies of FDI to our knowledge.",

On the one hand, this selection may not be a significant issue because the vast majority of FDI in the world economy is between the developed economies, which are well represented in our sample. On the other hand, it is useful to know how FDI determinants may differ when a more representative sample of countries is examined. Our M&A data source has the ability to address this as it is a census of worldwide M&A activity. Table 5 lists all variables with inclusion variables above 50% for three specifications using logged data for the year 2000. The first two columns of inclusion probabilities are for comparison purposes and are for the FDI stock specification and the M&A specification when limited to the same observations as the FDI stock sample. The third column is the M&A specification when we use all observations for which we have available data (we call this the \"worldwide\" sample), as opposed to the restricted sample (we call this the \"OECD\" sample). This more than triples the sample size over the other two listed specifications to 3,429 observations, adding many more observations involving non-OECD countries. 15 The results from the worldwide M&A sample show a lot of commonalities with the previous results. Gravity variables, cultural distance and relative skilled labour variables all show very high inclusion probabilities. In fact, all of the variables that have high inclusion probabilities in the OECD M&A sample specification (column 2) also have high inclusion probabilities in the worldwide M&A sample specification. However, the worldwide M&A sample also shows high inclusion probabilities for a number of additional variables. These include a few more endowment variables (education levels in both the host and parent country as well as the squared difference in education levels between the two countries), as one might expect when one includes many more observations between relatively poor non-OECD countries and OECD countries. It also includes variables connected with bilateral treaties (bilateral investment treaty, double taxation treaty and service sector agreements) as well as the presence of a contiguous border. This suggests that these bilateral treaties may be much more important for spurring FDI into non-OECD countries than into OECD ones.",

Virtually all of the prior studies include gravity-related variables, and, thus, our results confirm the inclusion of such variables. Common official language also finds robust support in our analysis and is included in five of the prior eight studies in table 1. Beyond this small set of variables, however, prior studies vary significantly in what they include, and what they include does not necessarily match very well with the variables our analysis finds to have high inclusion probabilities. For example, our analysis finds that parent country wealth (real per capita GDP) has strong and robust support, yet only one study (Head and Ries 2008) of the eight studies in table 1 includes this variable. In contrast, four of the studies in table 1 include host country wealth, yet we find this variable does not have strong support for inclusion. The reason for this asymmetry in wealth effects on FDI is also something that past theoretical papers, to our knowledge, do not address. Only four of the prior eight studies include variables related to relative skilled-labour endowment levels or differences, whereas our analysis finds that such variables should be included. There is little evidence that other relative endowments matter besides the presence of oil in the host country. Colonial relationships, host country remoteness, trade agreements and customs unions are additional variables that find strong support in our analysis but are rarely included in prior studies. On the other hand, a number of the prior studies include variables connected to host country business costs, infrastructure and institutions, but these do not find robust support in our analysis. Finally, the studies in table 1 whose main focus is on a particular hypothesized relationship between a potential covariate and FDI generally do not fare very well in terms of the inclusion probabilities we estimate for the same covariate. This includes Wei (2000), whose focus is on corruption; Stein and Daude (2007), whose focus is on time zone differences; and di Giovanni (2005), whose partial focus is on financial market institutions.",

This includes the gravity variables, cultural distance variables and bilateral trade openness variables. For many of the coefficients, the magnitude of the effect is smaller in the worldwide M&A sample than for the OECD sample, which suggests that FDI responds much less to economic forces for host countries that are less developed. A few of the coefficients have unexpected signs. One of the more intriguing results is that while the bilateral distance between country pairs lowers FDI (as expected), the remoteness of both the parent and host countries (that is, how far they are from the entire world's markets, not just the other country in the country pair) has positive coefficients. This distinction has not been made before to our knowledge but certainly deserves future investigation. Another surprising result is that the presence of oil in the host country is associated with lower FDI, as is the strength of host country legal institutions. The posterior mean and variance of the slope coefficients can also be used to construct a \"pseudo t-ratio\" by dividing the posterior mean by the posterior standard deviation. This statistic is a natural candidate as a measure of the relative importance of potential covariates in a linear regression setting and is sometimes reported along with BMA inclusion probabilities. In our application, the pseudo t-ratios (not reported) provide very similar conclusions to those reached from the BMA inclusion probabilities regarding the relative importance of the candidate FDI determinants. As a specific example, for the log-levels specification using FDI stocks as the dependent variable, the ranking of FDI determinants by the two metrics is nearly identical, with the Spearman rank correlation statistic between the pseudo t-ratio and the BMA inclusion probability equal to 0.98.",

First-differencing in this manner eliminates a number of timeinvariant variables, as is typical. It unfortunately also eliminates a very large portion of the observations, due to many more missing values for variables in 1990. This may be why the FDI stock and OECD M&A samples have only one variable between them that comes in with an inclusion probability over 50%, though a possible alternative explanation is that bilateral FDI patterns are largely driven by slow-moving or time-invariant factors that are then differenced out of these regressions. However, the worldwide M&A sample still has over 1,200 observations and finds 12 variables to have inclusion probabilities over 50%.

To verify this, we also present results from an alternative prior specification known as the Unit Information Prior (UIP). The UIP is designed to contain roughly the same amount of information as a typical single observation (Kass and Wasserman 1995). EPR (2011) argue for the UIP as a reasonable \"default\" prior based on evidence that it outperforms the prior of FLS for prediction. As discussed in Kass and Wasserman (1995) and Raftery (1995), the UIP suggests a convenient approximation to the marginal likelihood based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which makes this prior simple to implement.

In the results presented above, we retained these observations in the sample by adding a small constant to each FDI measure before taking logarithms. Alternatively, we could have eliminated these observations from the sample.

Also, the negative binomial distribution is a discrete distribution with a natural interpretation for count data. 16 Extending the MC 3 algorithm discussed in section 3 for linear regression models to conduct BMA for negative binomial regressions is conceptually straightforward. Specifically, the only change is that the marginal likelihood in (3) is replaced by the marginal likelihood for the negative binomial model. Unfortunately, unlike the case of the linear regression model with natural conjugate priors, the marginal likelihood for the negative binomial model is not available analytically and needs to be approximated. One approach would be to compute a simulation-consistent estimate of the marginal likelihood using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. However, when incorporated inside of the large number of simulations necessary for the MC 3 algorithm, this would be very computationally demanding. Instead, we use an asymptotic approximation to the marginal likelihood based on the BIC. This requires only the maximum likelihood estimates of the negative binomial regression and can be computed relatively quickly. 17 Table 9 shows the posterior inclusion probabilities computed for the log-level linear regression model, along with those based on the negative binomial model, when we use the sample of cross-border M&A counts across OECD countries, i.e., the sample identical to the one used in the last column of table 4. We use the sample of OECD countries, rather than the larger worldwide sample, to reduce the computational time needed to calculate the SIC for the negative binomial specification. Results across the linear and negative binomial models are very similar, suggesting model misspecification bias from running linear models in this setting is small. Out of 52 potential covariates, there are only four instances where the inclusion probability of a covariate is very high in one specification but close to zero in the other. In particular, urban concentration of the parent country and host country oil production have very high inclusion probabilities in the linear specification but inclusion probabilities near zero in the negative binomial specification, while GDP similarity and host country political rights are estimated to have high inclusion probabilities in the negative binomial specification but inclusion probabilities near zero in the linear model. Three other variables, the squared education difference, host country trade openness and host country legal institutions, receive more support in the negative binomial specification, with inclusion probabilities roughly 50 percentage points above those for the linear model. Outside of these seven exceptions, which is less than 15% of the covariates we consider, the average absolute difference in inclusion probabilities across the linear and negative binomial models is just 2.6 percentage points. Also, it is notable that of the five variables for which the negative binomial model provides more support than the linear model, four have high inclusion probabilities for the linear model applied to the FDI stock or worldwide sample M&A count data. Thus, the negative binomial specification is not revealing a substantial number of additional relevant covariates beyond those identified elsewhere in our analysis.",

This is an interesting litmus test for the BMA procedure, as we would be concerned, for example, if standard gravity variables did not have high inclusion probabilities for trade flows using our BMA methods. The analysis also provides a comparison of the determinants of FDI and trade flows within the same framework. We gather data on bilateral trade flows from the dataset connected with Rose and Spiegel (2011) and made available online by Andrew Rose at faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/arose/RecRes.htm#Software. Specifically, the data are CIF imports measured in US$, taken from International Financial Statistics' Direction of Trade CD-ROM, deflated by U.S. CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), all items, 1982 to 1984 = 100. For comparison purposes, we sample the year 2000 for the same observations we use for our cross-border M&A results, which yielded the largest sample size out of all the FDI measures. Table 10 provides inclusion probabilities for our BMA analysis of trade flows, as well as repeats the cross-border M&A inclusion probabilities for comparison purposes. The table displays all variables that receive a 50% or higher inclusion probability for explaining at least one of either trade flows or M&A counts. Reassuringly, our BMA analysis of trade flows yields results that are quite in line with accepted practice on how to specify trade flows. The gravity variables and typical frictions (including trade and FDI agreements) show very strong support. This also means that our analysis suggests very similar determinants for trade and cross-border M&A, though there is much less support generally for endowment terms with trade than for cross-border M&A. The biggest differences between the two come in which business cost, infrastructure and other host-country attributes matter for trade versus cross-border M&A. For example, the number of Internet users, legal institutions and domestic credit have high inclusion probabilities for trade but not for cross-border M&A. This is not the first BMA analysis of trade flows. Eicher, Henn and Papageorgiou (2012) use BMA methods to examine the impact of preferential trade agreements on trade flows. They estimate very similar inclusion probabilities for the common overlap of variables between their study and ours, including strong support for GDP terms, geographic features (such as distance) and cultural distance terms.",

This suggests significant uncertainty in the true model of bilateral cross-country FDI patterns. Our approach is to provide some needed systematic investigation of the determinants of FDI by using Bayesian Model Averaging. Our analysis does not support the inclusion of many variables found in prior FDI studies and suggests that the statistical importance of the main focus variables in many prior studies is not robust to considering a much wider set of covariates. The results also suggest a fairly parsimonious FDI specification comprised of mainly gravity variables, cultural distance factors, parent-country per capita GDP, relative labour endowments and trade agreements.",

There are some obvious advantages and disadvantages with using M&A count versus (non-missing) value data. One clear disadvantage for our purposes was how many missing observations are created when using the value data-many of the bilateral country pairings show M&A activity, but the value data for all the M&A transactions for that pairing are missing. For this reason, and because the correlation between the M&A counts and values by bilateral-country pairs is 0.96, we use the M&A count data.",

However, our sample of M&A count data has sample variance far greater than sample mean, suggesting a model that incorporates this overdispersion is better suited for M&A counts. The negative binomial regression model, which arises from a natural extension of the Poisson regression, is a popular choice for overdispersed count data in the applied literature. Indeed, we experienced substantial convergence issues when estimating a simple Poisson specification, which further indicated that it is important to model overdispersion in these data. 17 The BIC approximation to the marginal likelihood is a common choice in applied work. See, for example,Brock, Durlauf and West (2003) andDoppelhofer, Miller and Sala-i-Martin (2004). For additional discussion of the BIC-based approach to model averaging, seeRaftery (1995).",
