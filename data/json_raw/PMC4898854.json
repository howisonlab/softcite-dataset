According to this, it is important to use more effective technologies and methods in health system in order to reach more effectiveness and saving in costs. This study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the technology of regional sterilization centers. Methods: This study was done in four steps. At the first step, safety and effectiveness of technology was studied via systematic study of evidence. The next step was done to evaluate the economical aspect of off-site sterilization technology using gathered data from systematic review of the texts which were related to the technology and costs of off-site and in-site hospital sterilization. Third step was conducted to collect experiences of using technology in some selected hospitals around the world. And in the last step different aspects of acceptance and use of this technology in Iran were evaluated. Results: Review of the selected articles indicated that efficacy and effectiveness of this technology is Confirmed. The results also showed that using this method is not economical in Iran. Conclusion: According to the revealed evidences and also cost analysis, due to shortage of necessary substructures and economical aspect, installing the off-site sterilization health technology in hospitals is not possible currently. But this method can be used to provide sterilization services for clinics and outpatients centers.",

Due to increasing number of hospitals, the rise of new and emerging diseases, increasing microbial resistance and need for various medical services, incidence of health care associated infections has become inevitable (1).In addition to death and complications, hospital infections increase the hospitalization period and consequently increase the cost of medical services and patients' dissatisfaction. Of course applying effective methods of sterilization will decline hospital infections and consequently the infections caused by it (2). In fact, sterilization means applying physical and chemical methods to destruction and disruption of all germs Endospore-resistant microbes (3).",

Health technology assessment is a technique which can help to answer the raised questions about off-site sterilization centers and to provide scientific evidence based on evidences related to this technology for policy maker to decision making. In this study of health technology assessment, researchers tried to compare new off-site sterilization technology with the common in-house sterilization method.",

It is obvious that after entrance of newer technologies and equipment to reduce the sterilization costs, facilitation of transporting the sterile equipment to the hospitals, appropriate training for the staff, and foundation of sterilization major in medical science universities in the future, off-site sterilization method can be revised. However, off-site sterilization method is acceptable for clinics and outpatient centres.",
