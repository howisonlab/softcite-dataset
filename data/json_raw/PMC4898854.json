According to this, it is important to use more effective technologies and methods in health system in order to reach more effectiveness and saving in costs. This study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the technology of regional sterilization centers. Methods: This study was done in four steps. At the first step, safety and effectiveness of technology was studied via systematic study of evidence. The next step was done to evaluate the economical aspect of off-site sterilization technology using gathered data from systematic review of the texts which were related to the technology and costs of off-site and in-site hospital sterilization. Third step was conducted to collect experiences of using technology in some selected hospitals around the world. And in the last step different aspects of acceptance and use of this technology in Iran were evaluated. Results: Review of the selected articles indicated that efficacy and effectiveness of this technology is Confirmed. The results also showed that using this method is not economical in Iran. Conclusion: According to the revealed evidences and also cost analysis, due to shortage of necessary substructures and economical aspect, installing the off-site sterilization health technology in hospitals is not possible currently. But this method can be used to provide sterilization services for clinics and outpatients centers.",

Due to increasing number of hospitals, the rise of new and emerging diseases, increasing microbial resistance and need for various medical services, incidence of health care associated infections has become inevitable (1).In addition to death and complications, hospital infections increase the hospitalization period and consequently increase the cost of medical services and patients' dissatisfaction. Of course applying effective methods of sterilization will decline hospital infections and consequently the infections caused by it (2). In fact, sterilization means applying physical and chemical methods to destruction and disruption of all germs Endospore-resistant microbes (3).",

These questions are about efficacy, efficacy costs and possibility of applying this method for instrument sterilization in the service provider centers in Iran. Health technology assessment is a technique which can help to answer the raised questions about off-site sterilization centers and to provide scientific evidence based on evidences related to this technology for policy maker to decision making. In this study of health technology assessment, researchers tried to compare new off-site sterilization technology with the common in-house sterilization method.",

For example, contractors may not be able to understand the organization's culture and the hospital's conditions (27). Always there is a risk of contractors' entrance to the market as the organization's competitor (28). Some studies have reported that delivering vital services out of the hospitals reduces the hospital's ability to meet urgent needs in times of crisis. If the contractor does not adhere to its obligations on the quantity and quality of services, due to the specialized nature of services and need for considerable investment, changing the contractor will be really difficult for the hospitals (29). So, monopoly on the important issue of providing hospital sterile equipment of a city in the hands of a company can be a serious threat (30).",

However, off-site sterilization method is acceptable for clinics and outpatient centres.",
