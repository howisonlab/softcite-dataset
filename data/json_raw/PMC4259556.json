            "text": "Network meta-analysis (NMA) has emerged as a useful analytical tool allowing comparison of multiple treatments based on direct and indirect evidence. Commonly, a hierarchical Bayesian NMA model is used, which allows rank probabilities (the probability that each treatment is best, second best, and so on) to be calculated for decision making. However, the statistical properties of rank probabilities are not well understood. This study investigates how rank probabilities are affected by various factors such as unequal number of studies per comparison in the network, the sample size of individual studies, the network configuration, and effect sizes between treatments. In order to explore these factors, a simulation study of four treatments (three equally effective treatments and one less effective reference) was conducted. The simulation illustrated that estimates of rank probabilities are highly sensitive to both the number of studies per comparison and the overall network configuration. An unequal number of studies per comparison resulted in biased estimates of treatment rank probabilities for every network considered. The rank probability for the treatment that was included in the fewest number of studies was biased upward. Conversely, the rank of the treatment included in the most number of studies was consistently underestimated. When the simulation was altered to include three equally effective treatments and one superior treatment, the hierarchical Bayesian NMA model correctly identified the most effective treatment, regardless of all factors varied. The results of this study offer important insight into the ability of NMA models to rank treatments accurately under several scenarios. The authors recommend that health researchers use rank probabilities cautiously in making important decisions.",

NMA enables researchers to obtain the relative efficacy of a particular intervention versus any competing intervention even when direct evidence is not present, via a common comparator. 8 NMA yields more precise estimates by combining direct and indirect evidence versus direct evidence alone. 4,6,7,9,10 In addition to relative effects, when conducted in a Bayesian framework, NMA generates the probability that each treatment is ranked first, second, and so on. 11,12 It has been applied in clinical research areas such as diabetes, 13 cardiovascular safety, 14 cancer, 15 anatomy, [16][17][18][19][20] and drug development, 21 and is gaining considerable favor among clinicians, guideline decision makers, and health technology agencies. [22][23][24] Considerable research focused on methodological issues of NMA has been published in recent years; however, a limited number of simulation studies have been conducted. In particular, few simulations have explored the operating characteristics of rank probabilities obtained from an NMA. Some concern has been raised about the use of rank probabilities in decision making. Researchers argue that rank probability is sensitive to various factors and it is biased when there is a paucity of direct comparisons. Because of this fragility, researchers claim that decisions based on rank probabilities should not be trusted unless accompanied with effect sizes of pairwise comparisons, such as means and their credible intervals, as in some cases individual treatments may be disqualified on the basis of cost or clinical contraindication. 11,[24][25][26] If there are few trials per comparison, as in the study by Haas et al 27 for neonatal mortality outcome, it may lead to the problem of overestimating rates, suggesting extra caution should be exercised when interpreting the treatment rankings. This study aims to investigate how rank probabilities obtained from a Bayesian NMA are affected by characteristics of the network, including network configuration, number of studies per comparison, individual study sample sizes, and effect sizes. The simulation was conducted for a binary outcome.",

The amount of available information is often represented in network plots by varying the sizes of nodes and thickness of edges. The visual depiction of a network can reveal that some treatments are included in significantly more studies than others. This disparity may come from comparator preference bias, sponsorship bias, selective reporting bias, and time lag bias. 4 Network geometries range from simple (a network with only three treatments) to very complex (a network with multiple treatments). 34 In this simulation study, graphical networks that often result from systematic reviews were considered: star, 35,36 loop, one closed loop, 25,36,37 and ladder (linear) 25,36,37  (Figure 2). All of the four network patterns also exist together in the paper published by Lu and Ades. 23 Each network comprises four nodes representing four interventions (treatments one to four labeled T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , and T 4 ).

The aggregate input data might be available in two formats: arm-level summaries (eg, odds, absolute risk, hazard, mean) or contrast-level summaries (eg, odds ratio, risk ratio, hazard ratio, mean difference). Arm-level data, which is modeled with the exact likelihood rather than its normal approximation, 6 were adopted in this simulation study. Both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks can suitably fit models for either of the two data formats. 38 Although inference based on NMA can be made in both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks, Bayesian NMA is more common and provides two advantages. First, it allows researchers to incorporate prior knowledge for parameters of interest and a rich and flexible family of models can be fitted. Second, treatment rank probabilities can be calculated easily. Employing a Bayesian framework requires the calculation of posterior distributions using MCMC methods. Procedures are described in detail by Salanti et al. 11 Furthermore, Bayesian inferences are exact for finite samples when appropriate priors are used (unlike frequentist inference, which relies on a normality assumption) and, hence, are more appealing, especially with small samples.",

While the MCMC method provides a convenient way to draw inference from complicated statistical models, there are some problems associated with this method. One of these problems is that convergence in MCMC sampler is a complex issue. It usually needs a large number of iterations to reach convergence. In addition, early MCMC iterations are highly sensitive to starting values of parameters and do not provide good information about the target distribution and, hence, are required to be thinned. The basic idea is that although the chains look divergent at early iterations due to different starting points, when the MCMC algorithm is converged, the chains should mix together and become indistinguishable from each other as they converge to the same posterior distribution. In this study, the package gemtc (http://cran.r-proct.org/web/packages/gemtc/index.html) from the R library, was used to implement the Bayesian NMA through MCMC simulation nicely, and is compatible with other packages that can conduct convergence diagnostics.",

Then, the hierarchical Bayesian NMA model was fitted to perform statistical inference. In each MCMC simulation, the first 5,000 iterations were discarded as a burn-in to minimize the effect of initial values on the posterior distribution. Moreover, to minimize poor mixing (or slow convergence), chains were thinned by keeping every tenth simulated draw from each MCMC sequence. After burn-in and thinning, 2,000 iterations were used to estimate posterior distributions and make inferences about rank probabilities. For each simulation setting, this process was repeated 1,000 times. Convergence was assessed using the Brooks-Rubin diagnostic test where a potential scale reduction factor of 1.05 or lower was considered sufficient for convergence. 41 The first rank probability estimates yielded from the MCMC process were averaged over the 1,000 simulations for each setting to create mean first rank probabilities. Two measures of performance, the bias for estimates of first rank probabilities and the standard deviation of the estimates over 1,000 samples, were calculated. In this section, estimates of the mean, bias, and standard deviation of first rank probabilities for each simulation setting are given. For the first two sets of success probabilities, no difference between the average first rank probabilities of T 2 , T 3 , and T 4 were expected. Table 4 shows results for a star geometry. For an equal number of studies per comparison, the star geometry identified treatments as expected with minimal bias. However, with an unequal number of studies per comparison, the star geometry showed large bias and large standard deviation. The upward bias of the first rank probability corresponds to the treatment with the smallest number of studies in the network. All possible permutations of the unbalanced number of studies were checked and showed that the overestimation of the first rank probability always aligns with the treatment used in the fewest number of studies. Table 5 shows results for the loop geometry. Here, T 3 was consistently underestimated, albeit slightly, though it was expected to be equivalent in efficacy with T 2 and T 4 .",

The impact of the number of studies on the rank probability was negligible. In this scenario, bias and standard deviations were generally very small in all cases.

Treatments that are compared directly with inferior treatments yield ranks that are overestimated, while treatments that are exclusively compared with equal or superior treatments yield ranks that are underestimated. When there is an unequal number of studies per comparison for a given network structure, the model overestimated the rank probability of the treatment associated with smaller number of studies. The first rank probability's overestimation when it is the least-studied treatment is an artifact of a larger estimated variance for that treatment. The rank probabilities obtained from Bayesian NMA for loop, one closed loop, and ladder geometry can be reliable only when there is direct evidence for every treatment involved in the analysis or when there is an obvious superiority in efficacy. In other words, rank estimates for treatments that have never been directly compared should not be trusted. The position of the reference treatment in the network may affect conclusions from rank probabilities. Increasing the sample size of individual studies did not help to adjust the over/underestimation of the rank probabilities.

In practice, multi-arm studies in NMA are often encountered where correlation is induced among contrasts that involve a common comparator and must be modeled. 38,42 Furthermore, this study only focused on the rank probabilities that each treatment is best, but the authors might be interested in investigating all of the ranks of available treatments.

            "text": "This simulation study revealed several occasions of bias of rank probabilities obtained from a Bayesian NMA. For example, for an unequal number of studies per comparison, the rank probability of the treatment with more studies was underestimated. In addition, the rank probability of the treatment that was directly compared with the placebo and an equivalent treatment simultaneously (eg, T 2 and T 4 in loop, ladder, and one closed loop geometries) gained spurious rank probabilities, whereas the rank probability of a treatment that was compared with two equivalent treatments (eg, T 3 in loop, ladder, and one closed loop) was underestimated. In summary, decisions should not be made based on rank probabilities especially when treatments are not directly compared (ie, ladder, one closed loop, star) as they may be ill-informed. ",
