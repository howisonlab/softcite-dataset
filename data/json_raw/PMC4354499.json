            "text": "Gene targeting refers to the precise modification of a genetic locus using homologous recombination. The generation of novel cell lines and transgenic mouse models using this method necessitates the construction of a 'targeting' vector, which contains homologous DNA sequences to the target gene, and has for many years been a limiting step in the process. Vector construction can be performed in vivo in Escherichia coli cells using homologous recombination mediated by phage recombinases using a technique termed recombineering. Recombineering is the preferred technique to subclone the long homology sequences (>4kb) and various targeting elements including selection markers that are required to mediate efficient allelic exchange between a targeting vector and its cognate genomic locus. Typical recombineering protocols follow an iterative scheme of step-wise integration of the targeting elements and require intermediate purification and transformation steps. Here, we present a novel recombineering methodology of vector assembly using a multiplex approach. Plasmid gap repair is performed by the simultaneous capture of genomic sequence from mouse Bacterial Artificial Chromosome libraries and the insertion of dual bacterial and mammalian selection markers. This subcloning plus insertion method is highly efficient and yields a majority of correct recombinants. We present data for the construction of different types of conditional gene knockout, or knock-in, vectors and BAC reporter vectors that have been constructed using this method. SPI vector construction greatly extends the repertoire of the recombineering toolbox and provides a simple, rapid and cost-effective method of constructing these highly complex vectors.",

Precise gene modification is achieved by the introduction of the targeting vector into embryonic stem (ES) cells 6 or somatic cells 7 , whereby homologous recombination between identical stretches of DNA sequence on the targeting vector and the genomic locus results in the transfer of the intended modification to the genome by gene conversion 8 . Such modified ES cells can be injected into mouse blastocysts to produce offspring (chimaeras) that can then transmit these modified alleles via the germline 9 . An alternate route to produce transgenic mice involves the microinjection of a gene expression vector into single celled mouse zygotes, which leads to the random integration of the vector in the mouse genome 10 . Traditional methods of vector construction have relied on conventional 'cut and paste' cloning using restriction enzymes and DNA ligases to clone the different selection marker and genomic fragments into a vector backbone. However, an inherent limiting factor of traditional cloning is the positioning and choice of restriction sites, especially with longer DNA sequences. This often necessitates multiple subcloning steps and also introduces extraneous DNA sequences into the vector, which often leads to a lower efficiency of gene targeting.",

Subcloning plus insertion (SPI) is a novel recombineering technique that combines beta recombination and gap repair cloning into a single process (Figure 1). SPI vector assembly is simple, quick and flexible and offers significant improvement on standard recombineering approaches ( Table 1). Here, we demonstrate the ease and utility of using SPI for different vector construction applications with a particular emphasis on constructing non-standard and challenging vector designs. Test cases included the construction of a fluorescent reporter knockin vector, a dual tagged protein expression knockin vector, a BAC fluorescent reporter vector and a conditional knockout vector. These examined variously the requirement to localize a cell surface receptor, purify a nuclear protein complex or conditionally ablate the expression of a gene.",

NOTE: Homology arms should not contain any repetitive elements, presence of repetitive elements will result in incorrect targeting and subcloning. Repetitive elements can be detected by using web based tools such as the ''Repeat Masker''. 2. Include a unique restriction enzyme (RE) site on one of the vector oligos to linearize the gene targeting vector for ES cell targeting (Figure 2). 3. Check oligo parameters using an oligo analyzer program. Take care to avoid secondary structures in the priming regions. 4. Shorter HA (50 bp) of the insertion cassette is tolerated and yields lower number of recombinants but ensure that the subcloning plasmid HA is always longer (180 bp). 5. Determine the orientation of the genomic DNA insert of the particular BAC clone using web based tools like ''cloneDB''. Establish the direction of replication from OriS by checking the map of the BAC plasmid backbone used in the BAC library construction. NOTE: OriS is usually opposite to the transcriptional direction of the Chloramphenicol (Chl) marker for all commonly used BAC plasmids. 6. Add two terminal phosphorothioate (PTO) bonds to the 5' end of the oligo that is opposite to the direction of replication on the BAC clone. Add a 5' phosphate modification to the reverse oligo ( Figure 2). NOTE: The asymmetric phosphorothioated PCR cassette upon Red digestion generates an ssDNA intermediate that can prime the lagging strand of the replication fork. NOTE: Maximal multiplex recombination frequency is observed with the lagging strand protected cassettes. Leading strand protected or dual protected cassettes may not produce equivalent recombination efficiencies at some loci. 7. Order oligos with PAGE or HPLC purification. ",

To test the application of SPI in knockin vector construction strategies, two different test cases were examined. Dnttip1 encodes the deoxynucleotidyltransferase, terminal, interacting protein 1A (TDIF1) that together with class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) form a mitotic deacetylase complex (MiDAC)",

Previous attempts to subclone a portion of the Dnttip1 gene using a p15A vector containing long homology regions resulted in low gap repair efficiency and frequent aberrant recombination products (data not shown). Thus, the construction of a knockin vector at the Dnttip1 locus provided a challenging recombineering exercise. A SPI strategy was designed to subclone a 12 kb section of the Dnttip1 gene spanning the last exon (exon 13) into a low copy p15A vector and to simultaneously insert a dual affinity tag selection cassette into exon 13, replacing the stop codon ( Figure 3A). The 2X FLAG-calmodulin binding protein (CBP) linked FRT-PGK-em7-Neomycin (Neo)-BGhpA-FRT cassette (2.0 kb) was amplified from an RE linearized plasmid using dual PTO modified oligos that contained 120 bp HA flanking the Dnttip1 stop codon. A p15A zeoDnttip1 subcloning vector (1.7 kb) was constructed that contained 200 bp regions homologous to the ends of the Dnttip1 sequence to be subcloned. The Dnttip1 subcloning plasmid was RE linearized and PCR amplified using 20 bp modified oligos that generated a leading strand protected vector. The PCR products were DpnI treated, purified and co-electroporated into recombineering competent Dnttip1 BAC E. coli cells as well as uninduced control cells. The SPI reactions were plated on Zeocin (Zeo) and Kanamycin (Kan) containing agar plates ( Figure 3B). SPI produced the correctly modified Dnttip1 knockin vector in all of the 12 recombinants analysed (Figure 3C). DNA sequencing verified the absence of any errors resulting from oligo synthesis or PCR amplification.",

            "text": "Another example of SPI involved the in-frame insertion of an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) linked selection cassette at the P2rx1 gene. The P2rx1 gene encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor that functions as an ATP-gated ion channel 29 . Linkage to YFP fluorescence permits the tracking of the P2x1 receptor on the cell surface in various functional assays. P2rx1 is another difficult locus that has presented significant problems with conventional recombineering methodologies (data not shown). Using SPI, a 12 kb segment of the P2rx1 gene encompassing the terminal exon (exon 12) was subcloned into a p15A zeo vector and modified with the concerted insertion of an eYFP-LoxP flanked Neo cassette replacing the stop codon in exon 12 to construct the P2rx1-eYFP knockin vector ( Figure 3D). In this example, the lagging strand protected p15A vector (1.7 kb) contained 230 bp HA and the eYFP cassette contained 50 bp HA and was also left unmodified. The eYFP insertion cassette (2.7 kb) was assembled by splicing overlap PCR of the eYFP gene, PCR amplified from pEYFP-C1, and the LoxP-PGK-em7-Neo-BGhpA-LoxP cassette, PCR amplified from pL452 (NCI, Frederick). The SPI reaction produced hundreds of colonies (data not shown). RE analysis of DNA minipreps prepared from 11 clones showed the majority contained the correctly assembled P2rx1-eYFP knockin vector ( Figure 3E). Additional validation by DNA sequencing showed error free insertion of the eYFP cassette. However, some of the clones showed profiles of the untagged gap repaired and the tagged gap repaired plasmids in the same cell (lanes 6-9). A few samples also contained incorrectly gap repaired (lane 2) or mistargeted plasmids (lanes 4 and 5). The failure of concurrent subcloning and targeting in some SPI recombinants highlights the limits of efficient SPI cloning when using large cassettes (> 3 kb), which arise from the constraints on Red processivity of long DNA fragments 30 , or if using short HA. Indeed, increasing the HA of the eYFP cassette to 200 bp increased SPI efficiency and the correct targeting of the cassette (data not shown). Gene targeting with the P2rx1-eYFP knockin vector in JM8.N4 mouse ES cells (C57BL/6 strain) generated 6 positive clones out of 96, which contained the correctly targeted P2rx1-eYFP sequence (Figure 3F).",

            "text": "Construction of ES cell lines and mouse models has historically involved gene targeting using plasmid constructs that contained the modified allele 4 . However, the construction of these complex gene targeting vectors has proved to be a significant bottleneck in the timely production of such models. The development of recombineering based vector construction strategies has allowed improved vector designs and more efficient vector assembly. Nonetheless, current recombineering protocols still involve multiple steps, require intermediate plasmid purification and use different bacterial strains. Subcloning plus insertion offers a novel approach to vector construction that can be performed in one electroporation event in the resident BAC host strain. The utility of SPI in gene targeting was tested here in a variety of vector construction applications. In all instances examined here, SPI proved to be efficient and the correct recombinant plasmid was produced. In the majority of the cases, the multiple different cassettes were correctly inserted in the targeting vector. Large DNA cassettes and vectors were easily accommodated in the SPI protocol and demonstrated the flexibility of this system. SPI relies on the use of long homology sequences and phosphorothioate (PTO) protection of the linear DNA cassettes. PTO modification confers protection against exonucleases to the linear DNA 20,21 and the long HA increases recombination efficiency to permit multiplexing. However, synthesis of longer oligo sequences increases the chances of accumulating errors especially deletions. Mutations in the oligo can be particularly detrimental if they cover protein coding regions. DNA sequencing across the HA and covering the full-length of the inserted cassette is highly recommended to eliminate clones with any sequence alterations. Use of a high-fidelity DNA polymerase system is also suggested to avoid introduction of any PCR errors. The length and composition of the HA of the subcloning plasmid is more critical relative to that of the insertion cassette (data not shown). For particularly sensitive applications like construction of knockin vectors, where any mutations in exon regions are not tolerated, the HA of the insertion cassette can be shortened (50-120 bp) to avoid problems associated with long oligos. The insertion cassette can also be left unmodified or dual phosphorothioated (where knowledge of the direction of replication is not available). But multiplexing in these cases still requires long protected HA subcloning plasmids. A caveat of this particular strategy is the lowering of multiplexing efficiency that can potentially impact SPI cloning at different loci.",

Up to four small cassettes (< 1.5 kb) can be inserted simultaneously with the SPI process, though the multiplexing efficiency decreases with each additional cassette (data not shown).

Resuspend the cells in a total volume of 50 \u03bcl of 10% glycerol and add 10-200 ng of the pSC101 BADgbaA recombineering plasmid.Obtain a single cell suspension by pipetting up and down several times and then transfer the cells to a pre-chilled 1 mm gap electroporation cuvette. 7. Electroporate the cells with a setting of 1.8 kv, 25 \u03bcF and 200 \u03a9.NOTE: Check the correct settings for each brand of electroporator. A time constant of electroporation less than 4 indicates the presence of salt and other impurities. 8. Immediately recover the cells in 1 ml of LB and transfer the cells to a 50 ml centrifuge tube. 9. Grow the BAC gbaA culture at 30 \u00b0C for 2 hr shaking at 200 rpm. NOTE: The pSC101 BADgbaA plasmid is lost when cells are grown at 37 \u00b0C due to inactivation of the temperature sensitive RepE replication factor. Grow gbaA cells at 30 \u00b0C to maintain the recombineering functions. 10. Add 9 ml of LB containing 12.5 \u03bcg ml-1  Chl and 4 \u03bcg ml -1 Tetracycline (Tet) to the recovered BAC gbaA culture.

Identify positive clones by the presence of a bright band at the expected size. NOTE: The high efficiency of the SPI cloning process generates mostly correct recombinants.2. Pick colonies into 5 ml LB pH 8 containing the selective antibiotic and grow O/N at 37 \u00b0C . 3. Prepare DNA minipreps using a column purification kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. 4. Prepare BAC miniprep DNA using standard phenol-chloroform isolation or a similar protocol. 5. Perform RE digests on the miniprep DNA. Separate DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis. Analyze RE patterns to identify the clones containing the expected fragments sizes of the correct targeting vector. Choose an RE that clearly discriminates between the vector lacking insert(s) and the vector containing the insert(s). 6. Optional: to obtain cells that are devoid of the BAC, which is still present in the E. coli after recombineering, use the miniprep plasmid DNA to transform DH5alpha or DH10B E. coli cells. 7. Perform DNA sequencing across the HA and insertion cassette to check oligo synthesis errors.",
