Here, we describe a method for targeted DNA cleavage that requires only the presence of an A nucleotide at the target position. The procedure involves hybridization of a complementary oligonucleotide probe to the target sequence. The probe is designed to create a deliberate G:A mismatch at the desired position of cleavage. The DNA repair enzyme MutY glycosylase recognizes the mismatch structure and selectively removes the mispaired A from the duplex to create an abasic site in the target strand. Addition of an AP-endonuclease, such as Endonuclease IV, subsequently cleaves the backbone dividing the DNA strand into two fragments. With an appropriate choice of an AP-cleaving enzyme, the 3 0-and 5 0-ends of the cleaved DNA are suitable to take part in subsequent enzymatic reactions such as priming for polymerization or joining by DNA ligation. We define suitable standard reaction conditions for glycosylase/AP-cleaving enzyme (G/AP) cleavage, and demonstrate the use of the method in an improved scheme for in situ detection using target-primed rolling-circle amplification of padlock probes.",

            "text": "Many of our successes in genetic research stem from the ability to manipulate DNA molecules in a highly precise manner. Amidst the current molecular tools, only a small subset has been developed for targeted cleavage of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A common route towards cleavage of synthetic ssDNA as well as genomic targets that have been rendered single-stranded (1) is by hybridization of an oligonucleotide probe to the desired site of cleavage. The probe and target form a short doublestranded (ds) DNA segment that can be targeted by a larger assortment of traditional cleavage strategies. Restriction endonucleases (2,3), for example, can be directed to cleave at the duplex structure if the duplex contains an appropriate recognition sequence. Although there are over 600 of these enzymatic scissors available commercially (4), the dependence on a multi-nucleotide recognition sequence can hamper the choice of exactly where the cut should occur. This is an important concern when targeting specific genomic sequences/ duplexes, as the desired site of cleavage may not coincide with the natural distribution of the recognition sequence within the genome. Also, each additional sequence to be cleaved requires a different restriction enzyme which can dramatically increase costs. There exist a few nicking enzymes (4) (http://www.neb.com/ nebecomm/tech_reference/restriction_enzymes/feature_ article_nicking.asp) that cleave just one strand of the duplex, however these enzymes suffer the same limitation of recognition sequence dependence as any other restriction enzyme.",

            "text": "To circumvent some of these problems, a cleavage strategy involving targeting oligonucleotides has been developed (5). In this approach, oligonucleotides are engineered to contain two parts; a sequence that base pairs with the target of interest, and a sequence that folds into a hairpin loop and forms the recognition sequence for FokI endonuclease. Hybridization of the probe targets the desired sequence, and cleavage of the probe-target hybrid is mediated by FokI bound in the hairpin loop (5). Optimal performance is observed when the probe-target duplex is formed first followed by addition of the restriction enzyme (5). Inherent to this method is the use of restriction enzymes that cleave outside of their recognition sequence. In general, these type IIS enzymes are thought to bind to DNA as monomers for the most part, but tend to involve dimerization of the cleavage domains of adjacent enzyme molecules for DNA cleavage (6,7). For this reason, many type IIS enzymes are much more active on DNA molecules that contain multiple recognition sites. We propose an alternative approach that combines the targeting accuracy of probe hybridization, while avoiding the potential limitations of type IIS restriction enzymes.",

            "text": "Cleavage of the target strand can then be mediated by a pair of DNA repair enzymes ( Figure 1) (8). Addition of the DNA repair enzyme MutY glycosylase (9,10), which specifically recognizes G-A mismatches, selectively removes the adenine from the G:A duplex (11) creating an apurinic (AP) site in the target DNA strand. Next, the abasic site can be severed using an enzyme with AP-cleaving activity such as Endonuclease IV. As there are several enzymes used here that recognize and cleave AP sites through different chemical mechanisms (12), we will refer to them collectively as AP-cleaving enzymes. The combined glycosylase/AP-cleaving (G/AP) reactions thus cleave the target strand while preserving the probe molecule intact; a critical feature in some probe-directed analyses as exemplified by the padlock probe application described here. Briefly, padlock probes are linear oligonucleotides which can be circularized by DNA ligase when correctly hybridized to target DNA sequences (13). If the padlock probe hybridizes close to the 3 0 -end of the target DNA fragment, the target itself can serve as the primer for the rolling circle amplification (RCA). This target-primed RCA enables intracellular localization of sequences for in situ analyses of cells and tissues (14). The approach is effective; however, RCA is inhibited in cases where the padlock probe hybridizes away from the 3 0 -end of the target (15). Here, we show that simple integration of a single nucleotide mismatch in the padlock probe is sufficient to direct G/AP cleavage of the target DNA, thus producing the primer for the RCA reaction. In addition, with an appropriate selection of AP-cleaving enzyme the cleaved fragments are suitable to participate in polymerization, ligation, or other further enzymatic reaction steps.",

In the presence of duplex DNA structures containing G:A or OG:A mismatched base pairs, MutY glycosylase selectively removes the undamaged A from the structure. Although seemingly counter-intuitive, the mechanism compensates for the cell's replication machinery which frequently mis-incorporates A residues across from oxidized G (25).

Several methods in molecular biology have further adapted the use of G/AP-cleaving enzymes for the modification of synthetic and amplified DNA molecules (28). For example, the USER TM cloning kit (New England Biolabs) uses a combination of UDG and Endo VIII for digestion of uracil containing PCR products for subsequent cloning (29). The procedure does not require in vitro ligation as the bacterial host repair mechanism is employed to join the nick sites upon transformation. In mutation detection or allele discrimination, the presence of a mutation results in cleavage of a mismatched probe molecule (30). The cleavage event is subsequently detected as a reduction in probe length or loss of energy transfer between donor and acceptor fluorophores located on opposing sides of the cleavage site. The purpose of this work is to expand the use of these DNA repair enzymes, beyond applications on synthetic or amplified DNA molecules, for modification of non-amplified DNA for subsequent manipulation of the generated DNA fragments. However, the combinations of enzymes as well as the cleavage conditions defined herein are also useful for manipulation of synthetic oligonucleotides.",

As an initial step, an internally labeled tracking oligo was created by ligating a 5 0 -32 P labeled oligonucleotide with an adjacently hybridized oligonucleotide. The resultant 34 nt tracking oligo formed an imperfect duplex with the ligation template, resulting in a G:A mismatch. Following MutY glycosylase treatment, the abasic sites were cleaved with AP-cleaving enzyme Endonuclease IV which reduced the length of the tracking probe to 17 nt. Then, a 23 nt oligonucleotide was added to anneal immediately 5 0 to the nick site. Successful ligation by T4 ligase thus resulted in increasing the length of the tracking oligo to 40 nt. Since the tracking oligo was radio-labeled, changes in the oligonucleotides length were detectable by PAGE ( Figure 3B). Well over 75% of the oligonucleotides underwent both cleavage in the G/AP reaction and ligation at the cleaved site. Interestingly, as can be seen in Figure 2B, Endonuclease IV leaves a sugar at the 5 0 side of the lesion after lysis of abasic sites. The presence of the deoxyribose-5 0 -phosphate (dR5P) should inhibit ligation, however, Endonuclease IV proved to be one of the better AP-cleaving enzymes to use in this configuration. This is probably due to the spontaneous loss of extremely labile 5 0 -terminal dR5P (31) in aqueous solutions.",

The design of such experiments involves cleavage of the mitochondrial genomes with restriction enzymes, followed by 5 0 exonucleolytic degradation of one of the genome strands. The 5 0 exonuclease serves to expose a single-stranded target sequence for hybridization of the padlock probe. Padlock probes are hybridized, ligated and amplified by RCA, where the cleaved genomic fragment serves as the primer for the \u00c829 DNA polymerase. In cases where the DNA target extends a few nucleotides beyond the hybridization site of the padlock probe, the inherent 3 0 exonucleolytic activity of \u00c829 effectively digests the extension to initiate RCA. RCPs are subsequently detected using fluorescence microscopy.",

            "text": "One consistent observation has been that the reaction is more efficient when the restriction site is closer to the padlock probe hybridization site. This could be attributed to either inefficiencies in the genome preparation step (14), inhibition of \u00c829's exonucleolytic activity, or a combination thereof. A plausible explanation for the reduction in single-stranded exonucleolytic activity may be that longer fragments are more likely to form secondary structures. Additionally, 3 0 -ends involved in hairpins could act as a primer for 'fold-back' synthesis using the target strand as a template instead of the circularized padlock probe. Figure 5A outlines the strategy taken to test if G/ AP-mediated cleavage of mismatched sequences could increase the efficiency of the target-primed in situ RCA of padlock probes. Similar to previous experiments, restriction enzymes were first used to cut the genome, and an exonuclease was applied to prepare the singlestranded target for probe hybridization. Following ligation, samples were digested with G/AP enzymes, amplified by RCA, and exposed to fluorescence labeled detection probes. The cells were finally studied using an epifluorescence microscope. Two series of experiments were the initial restriction digestion of the genome occurred at different nucleotide distances from the padlock hybridization position. One set of experiments used the restriction enzyme BsmI which cleaved the target roughly 40 nt from the padlock probe hybridization site, and a second set of experiments used BtsI which cleaved 400 nt from the padlock site. As Figure 5B demonstrates, addition of the G/AP step results in a notable increase in the number of RCPs detected compared to reactions where the G/AP step was omitted. For both the 40 and 400 nucleotide overhangs, roughly 2.5-3.5 times more RCPs were observed compared to negative controls (no G/AP). Thus, addition of the G/AP treatment step in the target-primed RCA method enables some relaxation of assay design criteria.",

            "text": "Along with serving vital functions in maintaining healthy genomes, glycosylases and AP-cleaving enzymes are effective and versatile biotechnology tools for in vitro manipulation of nucleic acids. Cleavage of DNA fragments basically follows a two-step mechanism. First, MutY glycosylase disunites the base from the sugar-phosphate backbone. Scission of the target DNA strand is the consequence of subsequent hydrolysis of the apurinic site with Figure 5. In situ detection of mitochondrial DNA using padlock probes and RCA. (A) (i) Genomic DNA is made single-stranded by restriction enzyme digestion and exonucleolytic digestion of one of the genomic DNA strands. This step generates a single-stranded DNA segment at the desired target site. (ii) Hybridization and ligation of a padlock probe. The resulting probe/target duplex contains a G:A mispair, respectively. The target strand is then cleaved at the mismatch site by MutY/Endo IV. (iii) The padlock probe is amplified by RCA followed by detection probe hybridization to the RCPs. (B) The effect of MutY/Endo IV when applied in situ on fixed cells detecting mitochondrial DNA. For comparison, the mitochondrial genome was cleaved at two different distances from hybridization site of the padlock probe. (i) Cleavage using restriction enzyme BsmI with a restriction site $40 bp 3 0 from padlock target site without and (ii) with an addition of MutY/Endo IV. (iii) Cleavage using restriction enzyme BtsI $400 bp 3 0 from padlock probe site without and (iv) with addition of MutY/Endo IV. The average number of RCPs per cell, as determined by the BlobFinder program, is displayed in the upper right corner of each picture. Cell nuclei were stained blue using DAPI and RCPs were stained using fluorescence labeled oligonucleotides and are shown in purple. Scale bar, 20 mm. one of several enzymes exhibiting AP-cleaving activity. The purpose of this work has been to optimize and demonstrate the use of G/AP as a general tool for probedirected cleavage of single-stranded DNA sequences. For the in situ padlock probe application described here, G/AP-mediated cleavage effectively prepares the target to serve as a primer for the subsequent rolling circle reaction. Resulting RCPs remain localized and can reveal the cellular location of the target sequences.",

Standard nucleotides are used in the probes, avoiding the need for expensive synthesis of oligonucleotides with exotic modifications such as OG. With proper oligonucleotide design, multiple sequences could be targeted simultaneously with a common pair of G/AP enzymes and reaction conditions. It is furthermore of particular importance in the padlock probe application that the probe that directs the cleavage reaction remains intact. Thus, in our application, the site-directed cleavage can be directed by the padlock probe sequence without destroying the padlock probe itself. The approach is directly applicable to synthetic and single-stranded DNA species such as cDNA, however as demonstrated herein, the approach can also be used for cleavage of genomes if the target sequence is first rendered single-stranded.",

For example, in our hands the best combination for cleavage of single-stranded U-containing fragments is UDG and Fpg ( Supplementary Figure 1). In addition, many enzymes have more than one catalytic activity and DNA repair enzymes are no exception. We noticed that quite a few of the AP-cleaving enzymes tested herein also show weak to moderate exonuclease activity (data not shown). The exonuclease activity is dependent on Mg++ concentration (33), so for in vitro use, simply omitting MgCl 2 from buffer systems helped to reduce undesired exonuclease activity while leaving the AP-cleaving activity intact. Regarding the extensive debate in the scientific literature about the classification of MutY glycosylases (11,24), the enzyme as provided by the two commercial sources and used here appears to harbor both glycosylase and partial lyase activity. In our hands, MutY glycosylase thus exhibits bifunctional properties rather than behaving strictly as a monofunctional glycosylase. That being said, many of the AP-cleaving enzymes described here showed much higher cleaving efficiencies than MutY glycosylase on its own.",
