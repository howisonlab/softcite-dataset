A common problem when developing new image analysis algorithms is the need of large datasets with ground truth on which the algorithms can be tested and optimized. Generating such datasets is often tedious and introduces subjectivity and interindividual and intraindividual variations. An alternative to manually created ground-truth data is to generate synthetic images where the ground truth is known. The challenge then is to make the images sufficiently similar to the real ones to be useful in algorithm development. One of the first and most widely studied medical image analysis tasks is to automate screening for cervical cancer through Pap-smear analysis. As part of an effort to develop a new generation cervical cancer screening system, we have developed a framework for the creation of realistic synthetic bright-field microscopy images that can be used for algorithm development and benchmarking. The resulting framework has been assessed through a visual evaluation by experts with extensive experience of Pap-smear images. The results show that images produced using our described methods are realistic enough to be mistaken for real microscopy images. The developed simulation framework is very flexible and can be modified to mimic many other types of bright-field microscopy images.",

This development has rendered manual analysis of all the resulting data to no longer being a feasible approach. Therefore, computer-based evaluations using advanced image analysis have become an integral part of many research projects, for example, in (1). A good example of a field where research on the use of image analysis as a diagnostic tool has been ongoing for many years is that of Papanicolaou (Pap) test analysis. Attempts at the creation of automated systems have been made since 1950s, and the problem is still subject to active research (2).",

This is used to measure the performance and robustness of developed algorithms. Acquiring this ground-truth data can, however, in many cases be a very difficult prospect. Aside from issues such as obscuring biological material, the image will have been subjected to aberrations linked to the modality of the acquisition technique (3). The process of dealing with these degenerative effects can often become very complicated. When working with images acquired from a microscope, one may have to deal with issues such as uneven illumination, detector noise, and compression artefacts (4,5). These errors are added to already existing aberrations related to the physical limitations of the optics (6).",

Regions with well distributed and mainly free-lying cells on conventional smears look similar to LBC:s and those are reasonably well represented by our simulator. By increasing the object distribution density, the generated images will become more similar to dense regions on smears. But, the conventional smears also contain highly dense regions with many layers of cells, mucus, and other obscuring structures.

To overcome some of these problems, so-called LBC preparation methods have been developed. Using LBC, the sample is immersed in a solution that is then subjected to a number of processes that work to homogenize the sample, remove unwanted components (e.g., red blood cells) and finally deposit a suitable mono-layer sample on a glass slide (13). These samples are considerably less cluttered and while thickness of the cells distribution still varies, it is overall far less than for the conventional smear. However, the types of debris objects described in the Problem Statement section earlier will still be present in samples prepared using an LBC protocol.",

The database contains specimen prepared using both the conventional method as well as the LBC method. Image acquisition was performed using an Olympus BX51 bright-field microscope equipped with a 403, 0.95 NA lens and a Hamamatsu ORCA-05G 1.4 Mpx monochrome camera, giving a pixel size of 0.25 mm. The microscope light path was filtered using a 570-nm bandpass filter, a wavelength previously shown to maximize the contrast of nuclei in Pap-smears (14). The microscope was fitted with an E-662 Piezo server controller (Physik Instrumente GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany). This allowed for z-axis step control with a 0.1 mm resolution during image acquisition.",

These objects include cell nuclei, cell cytoplasms, bacilli, WBC, OOF objects, and speckles. Once the primitives are created they are distributed over the image using a weighted distribution model. Also, each object is given a depth coordinate. In the second phase image degradation similar t p , the one seen in bright-field microscopes is simulated. Finally, in phase 3, sensor noise is simulated according to the characteristics of a CCD sensor. To add randomness to the nucleus texture generation, each new texture is generated from three different sample nuclei randomly selected from the database. This significantly reduces the risk of recurring texture details. Furthermore, we have added weighting to the patch selection so that patches that are to be placed close to the center of the phantom are more likely to be found in central parts of the sample images. An example of a generated nucleus can be seen in Figure 5.",

            "text": "The cytoplasm texture is difficult to define as it is mainly a result of which deformations it has been exposed to. To that end, a cloth simulation algorithm (25) has been used to simulate cytoplasm deformations. The cloth simulator starts with a circular mesh, that is, a grid-like structure consisting of a number of points (vertices), x5\u00f0x; y; z\u00de, connected by edges. This mesh is then deformed using a force-field that gradually shrinks to the generated shape's outer boundary and pushing on vertices that it touches on the way. The deformation of the cloth takes place in 3D with a ground plane limiting movements in a negative z-direction. In the end, the cloth object will have an outer boundary that corresponds to the generated shape, but the vertices that make up the central part of the mesh will be pushed to produced wrinkles and folds. The cloth simulation is an iterative physics simulation where each vertex in the cloth mesh is given acceleration depending on outer forces that affect it as well as inner forces decided by the distances to its neighbors. One iteration of the simulation is called a time-step. The index t gives the time that has passed as the initiation of the simulation, and Dt is used to indicate how much time is increased between iterations. At each iteration, a vertex's new position, x t1Dt , is calculated using the Verlet integration (26),",

The first level is a low frequency Gaussian noise that adds intensity variations to the texture. The second level is composed of thresholded Brownian noise, which is a correlated noise whose power spectrum decreases as a function of f 2 . This noise appears as clouds of small flecks that are unevenly distributed over the cytoplasm, which corresponds to, for superficial squamous cells, fairly commonly seen keratin precursors. The final level of detail entails the simulation of a cytoskeleton structure. The skeleton is generated by first generating a random Voronoi diagram by randomly placing points in an image. The diagram is relaxed using Lloyd's algorithm (27) to get a more evenly spaced point distribution. A radial distance transform is generated from the edge of the image to create a downward slope from the middle of the image to the edges. Random vertices of the Voronoi diagram are then selected and a line is created by following the edges of the diagram by steepest descent according to the distance transform. A random chance of branching at each vertex results in a random tree structure that is very similar in appearance to cytoskeletons observed in reference images. In Figure 7, the three levels of details that can be added to the cytoplasm base texture have been illustrated as well as an example of a finished textured cytoplasm.",

Objects in bio-logical samples tend to end up in more concentrated groups (28). The problem of population generation has previously been studied as described in (4) and (29) showing meaningful results. For this study, we have instead chosen to use a different approach, a method known as rejection sampling (30), in computer graphics also known as Russian Roulette Monte Carlo sampling (31), to generate our distributions. The basic concept behind rejection sampling is that a coordinate pair drawn from a uniform distribution is accepted with a probability W x,y , where W 5\u00bdw i;j M3N ; w i;j 2 \u00bd0; 1. We call W a weight-map and a distribution created using W a weighted distribution. New coordinate pairs are drawn until a specified number of coordinates have been accepted. This approach is simple to use and produce good results as long as W contains large enough areas with a relatively high probability score. For weight-maps, where all positions have a low probability the algorithm will take a long time to execute as the rejection rate will be high. However, with proper understanding of the method's limitations the approach works exceedingly well.",

Sometimes it is biological material such as cells, WBC clusters or mucus. Other times, the cause is dirt on the cover glass of the samples or air bubbles in the fixation liquid. These artifacts can take on many forms, and it is an ambitious task to try to simulate all of them. However, because they generally are placed so far outside the focus plane, their appearance is very blurred. To that end, we have created an out of focus (OOF) debris group where an object is created using the same parametric model and textured the same way as the WBC described in White Blood Cells section. These objects are then taken to be placed at a focus plane well outside the defined space and blurred accordingly (see Impulse response section).",

We can then compare each offset step in the focus stack to a Gaussian blurred version of the focused image, allowing us to decide which sigma yields a degradation that lies closest to the observed one. The quantification is achieved by taking the sum of the intensity difference for each pixel of the nucleus. In Figure 10, a plot showing the optimal ratio r/mm, relative to each focus level offset can be seen for a sample cell. The same experiment was carried out for a representative population of 10 different cells. For small focus offsets, it is, due to discretization issues, hard to get reliable measurements.

Under normal operating conditions, this noise is Poisson distributed and quite easy to simulate. A second type of sensor noise significant enough to be added to the simulation is called readout noise that is a product of phenomena related to the A/D converter and amplification circuits.

Before showing the image to the user, a pixel-wise Gaussian noise (r 5 0.7 graylevels) was added. This was done to make the variations in background intensity and smoothness between different real images less visually disturbing, making it easier to focus on the details in the images.

Based on these values, the sensitivity, TP/(TP1FN), and specificity, TN/(TN1FP), for each user was also calculated. In this setting, the sensitivity value relates to the ability to accurately detect real images as being real and the specificity the ability to accurately detect synthetic images as synthetic. The sensitivity for the six human test subjects is not consistent with a random result (Mean: 0.7667, 95% confidence interval [0.671, 0.863]), but it is still low enough to indicate that experienced individuals had a difficult time separating real images from synthetic ones under these experimental conditions. The random assignment, \"subject x,\" achieved almost as good results as the actual persons, it deviated somewhat from the expected 0.50 in sensitivity and specificity as the population size was rather small. A different experimental design may have given different results. It is usually possible to tell the difference if you are given unlimited time and can zoom and scroll the image arbitrarily. But in routine cytology screening, the time available for this analysis is extremely limited so our conclusion is that our synthetic images are visually quite similar to real ones when studied under realistic conditions.",

However, the angle of the linear dependency shows that the real data have a wider distribution than the synthetic data. This, again, is not surprising as each synthetic nucleus texture represents a combination of data from three real nuclei. The choice of using three nuclei as a sampling base stems from an effort to make the texture of the synthetic nuclei more general and not a scrambled copy of a single. This had the side effect of making the variation in the synthesized textures somewhat smaller than in the real ones. This effect would be reduced if we used a single real nucleus as a model for the texture of a synthetic one.",

The quantile-quantile plot illustrate whether the acquired measurements belong to the same distribution. A linear relationship indicates that points belong to the same probability distribution. When the trend is steeper than 45 degrees, which is the case in the plots above, it is an indication that the data plotted on the y-axis, which refers to real data in this figure, has a larger dispersion than the x-axis data. this article. As an example, the addition of other common cervical epithelial cell types, for example, parabasal cells or squamous superficial cells, can be achieved by creating small databases of primitives that can then be used as the basis for shape and texture generation. To illustrate this, a dataset of cells, expert classified to exhibit signs conforming to high grade intraepithelial lesions, were collected and added to the simulation pipeline. A resulting image can be seen in Figure  13. This flexibility indicates that the synthesis process could be adapted to mimic other types of cellular material commonly analyzed using bright-field microscopy, for example, lung or oral cavity smears.",

Because synthetic images are the result of their defining parameters, there exists a limitation in the variation present in the images. Good design can, to a certain extent, alleviate the problem, but the fact remains that real data remains a necessity in the creation of any image processing algorithm aimed at real world applications. However, one can compare the risk of overfitting synthetic data with the risks of overfitting when tuning algorithms with the help of small amounts of real ground truth data. We can benefit from the great flexibility of synthetic data, while at the same time guarantee an estimate on real data if proper cross-validation is performed for the final parameter tuning using real expert annotated data.",
