These alterations relate particularly to an absolute and re lative accumulation of collage n types I a nd III in Disordered MMP activity could theoretically contribute to such pathological states as progressive hepatic fibros is and cirrhosis. Advanced hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis are generally considered to be irreversible conditions even after removal of the injurious agent. Moreover, the development of cirrhosis is characterized by a diminution of liver MMPs activity, implying that the capacity of the diseased liver to remodel the fibrotic matrix is cortically reduced. In studies undertaken to measure MMPs activity in hepatic fibrosis, a general pattern emerges. Initially there is a reversible phase with active ECM remodelling and detectable MMPs activity. In late disease, fibrosis becomes irreversible and, at this point, MMPs activity falls 2 2 -2 5 ) .",
