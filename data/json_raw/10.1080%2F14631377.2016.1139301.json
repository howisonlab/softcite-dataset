However, the defence economic dimension of the Ukraine crisis has been relatively neglected.",

What have been the unique defence economic institutions and policies that have enabled the USSR and Russia to produce military capabilities that have appeared to be more substantial than warranted by their economic power? Did the policies of national governments in Europe to achieve financial 'peace dividends' in the post-Cold War period adversely affect NATO's conventional military capabilities and thereby its deterrence of Russian actions related to Ukraine? Have the dynamics of economic, technological and military balances influenced the general developments in security in Europe and the genesis of the Ukraine conflict? Did Western economic warfare and sanctions directed at the USSR/ Russia over the period 1917-2013 achieve established goals concerning the alteration of economic and military power balances? What have been the economic and military impacts on Russia of Ukraine-related economic sanctions during 2014-2016?",

The first is concerned with the assessment of: the organisation and performance of the defence sectors in the economies of the USSR and Russia; trends in defence capabilities, economic and military balances, and conventional deterrence in Europe; the adequacy of resources allocated to support NATO, including its expansion in the 2000s; and comparison of the economic power and military capabilities of Russia and Ukraine in 2013-2016. The second section evaluates the causes and features of Western economic warfare directed at the USSR/Russia, as well as Russian responses and economic results in the periods 1917-1945, 1945-1991 and 1992-2013. it then describes Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia in connection with the Ukraine conflict and assesses their economic, military and political impacts. The remainder of this introduction reviews concepts related to these main sections.",

Economic power is produced by an economic system that is governed by economic policies and functions in a multi-dimensional economic environment (Gregory & Stuart, 1999). OECD/NATO countries have had competitive and open market economies, which over time have performed well at macro and micro levels in the generation of economic power. in contrast, the USSR/CMEA countries had centralised, state-owned, planned and closed economies. These developed the characteristics of a 'shortage economy' , which generated rapid extensive economic growth but inhibited efficiency and technological progress (Davis & Charemza, 1989;Kornai, 1980Kornai, , 1992. Following the collapse of the communist/ command systems in Europe, all countries engaged in the processes of economic transition. Those in East Europe and the Baltic region made rapid progress to market economies and joined the EU. But Russia, Ukraine and other states that emerged from the USSR developed hybrid economic systems (part market, part state) that performed poorly in the 1990s.",

The adverse impacts of a sustained heavy defence burden on the USSR are evaluated in Davis (1990a).",

Following the victory Lenin recognised the economic weakness of the revolutionary nation and introduced the New Economic Policy in the 1920s to stimulate an economic recovery and ease domestic political tensions. Although the large Red Army was demobilised and much of the defence industry was converted to civilian production, the government understood the importance of providing a strong economic foundation for the military power of the socialist state in a threatening world (Davis, 1991a;Erickson, 1962;Pozharov, 1981). The adoption of the Stalinist economic programme, including the high priority status of defence, generated rapid industrialisation in the 1930s (Davis, 1996). This enabled the USSR to shift economic and military balances in its favour in peacetime and to convert quickly to a militarised economy during World War ii (Harrison, 1985).",

Microeconomic processes were dominated by barter between firms, build-ups of informal inter-enterprise debt, pervasive second economy activity and corruption (HP 2), ineffective privatisation, limited industrial restructuring, and little FDi (see Note 10). By the mid-1990s Russia had a 'virtual economy' in which the state pretended to promote market-oriented reform while using the RMS to transfer value from the energy sector to negative value-added industries (HP 1, HP 3) in order to avoid mass bankruptcies and political unrest (Gaddy & ickes, 1998(Gaddy & ickes, , 2005. 7 in 1998 Russia experienced a new financial crisis due to its large budget deficits and debt (GKO) levels and a 50% drop in the price of oil to $11 per barrel.",

Despite slow progress with economic reforms in Russia, GDP grew by an average of 7% during 2000-2008 due to increases in earnings from energy exports (the oil price rose to a peak of $145 per barrel in 2008) and in consumption and investment. The greater resource rents available to the government through the RMS (HP 4) enabled it to support welfare programmes, subsidise negative-value added and loss-making industries (HP 3), and reduce domestic and international debt (Connolly, 2015a;Gaddy & ickes, 2010). However, the RMS continued to allow substantial informal siphoning off of rents and the second economy (HP 2), with its related corruption networks, remained an important component of the Russian economy (Kim & Kang, 2009). The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) caused temporary negative growth, but the population and economy in Russia were protected by stabilisation funds built up prudently by imposing high taxes on energy exports. During 2010-2013 GDP growth was a healthy 3.4%, inflation remained low, and surpluses were achieved in the state budget and current account (see Table 3 for 2012-2013). Russia's high growth rates enabled it to reduce the economic power gap in Europe.",

By 2013 the USA had only 53 MB tanks and 48 helicopters in the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) zone. National armies were reduced. Germany cut the size of its armed forces from 321,000 to 186,450 and the number of MB tanks from 2815 to 322 (Table 2). From 1993 to 2013 the number of combat aircraft in France was cut from 630 to 290. NATO defence spending rose after 11 September 2001, but most of the increment was devoted to War on Terror operations outside of Europe (iraq, Afghanistan). Defence expenditure was reduced significantly in most European countries after the GFC and by 2013 their average defence share of GDP was 1.6% (Table 4)  (iiSS, 2014).",

NATO Europe per capita defence expenditure in real terms ($2005) dropped from $715 in 1990 to $515 in 2000 to $401 in 2013 (Table 4)  Figure 2. the organisation of the Russian defence sector in the early 2000s. source: Davis (2002, p. 161). Since spending by European countries after 2001 included significant 'out-of-area' components, per capita expenditure of relevance to the defence of Europe was lower during the 2000s than is suggested by aggregate defence spending figures. NATO also proceeded with the development of a missile defence system in Europe. This was strongly opposed by Russia, which withdrew from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty in 2007 in retaliation. Overall, the sustained reductions in military expenditure and armed forces by NATO countries during 1991-2013 undermined conventional deterrence in Europe. 11 Over this period NATO countries also significantly scaled back intelligence efforts focussed on Russia (CiA/DiA in the USA and Mi6/Ministry of Defence in the UK), and redeployed experienced analysts with Russia/Ukraine area knowledge and language capabilities to the War on Terror in the Middle East and South Asia. in 2011-2012 the USA announced that it would be making a major shift in its strategic focus away from peaceful Europe to the Asia-Pacific region to deal with new threats.",

This section focuses on the interconnections between economic and military developments in Ukraine and Russia. The crisis grew out of the need by Ukraine to obtain external support for its faltering economy either from the EU/iMF (requiring wide-ranging reforms and a Greece-style austerity programme) or from Russia as a reward for participating in the new EEU. The decision by President Yanukovich in Autumn 2013 to pursue the latter course provoked the Maidan protest movement (Gaddy & ickes, 2014a). The government found that it had to rely primarily upon the highly-paid riot police (Berkut) in controlling the increasingly violent political dispute because the ordinary police had divided loyalties and the underfunded armed forces made it clear that they would not get involved in an armed conflict involving Ukrainian citizens. Following the overthrow of the President in February 2014, the interim government reversed foreign economic policies to favour the EU and expressed an interest in joining NATO (Gaddy & ickes, 2014c). in response to these political changes and the growing problems in the economy, the iMF (international Monetary Fund), EC (European Commission) and USA have been providing Ukraine with substantial financial assistance, which is linked to economic reform and austerity programmes. 12 Russia disapproved of the revolutionary changes in Ukraine and perceived a risk that it would lose its important military bases in Crimea, which give it access through the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea (e.g. for naval transport of weapons systems and ammunition to Syria). Since the bilateral economic and military balances were in Russia's favour (Table 5) and conventional deterrence of NATO had degraded (Table 2), it implemented a covert operation to take control of Crimea that was effective because competent non-violent actions by pro-Russia units and Russian special forces were backed by the implicit threat of decisive military intervention by Russia.",

The poor performances of the Ukraine armed forces in the two active phases of the war reflected the sustained neglect of them by successive governments. Some pro-Ukraine politicians and security analysts in the West argued in favour of such supplies in order to turn the tide of battle. However, the prevailing opinion was that the current imbalance of military power in Ukraine in favour of the insurgents in the eastern regions and Russia could not be changed in the short-term by foreign powers providing more sophisticated weapons to Ukraine. Evidence was provided earlier in this article concerning the record of the repeated failures of the USA in supplying weapons to weak governments with poorly performing armies (see pp. 7 and 12). it has been clear that the armed forces of Ukraine would require extended intensive training before they could handle some of the systems (e.g. the AN/TPQ-53 mobile anti-artillery radar system) being proposed by supporters of arms supplies. Other drawbacks to this interventionist policy were the comprehensive penetration of Ukraine government organisations by Russian intelligence and Russian escalation dominance in conventional weapons (Allison & Simes, 2015). Taking these factors into account, NATO probably was correct in deciding to not provide weapons directly to Ukraine during 2014-2015 (Monaghan, 2015).",

The features of Western economic warfare and Soviet counter-measures during 1917-1945 are described in Table 6. 13 However, participation in anti-USSR economic warfare was uneven (EWF 5 Comprehensiveness) due to competition between the leading capitalist nations in military and economic spheres. Germany covertly provided the USSR armed forces and defence industry with assistance in the 1920s (D'yakov & Bushueva, 1992;Nekrich, Ulam, & Freeze, 1997). Western firms, notably American ones, exported large quantities of machinery and equipment to Stalin's USSR in the 1930s, which assisted its rapid industrialisation (Sutton, 1971). Germany exported manufactured goods to the USSR during 1939-1941 in return for supplies of energy and raw materials needed to wage its war in the West, whereas the USA and Britain provided the Soviet Union with substantial economic and military assistance to fight Germany in the years 1941-1945 (Ericson, 1999;Nekrich et al., 1997).",

The first case illustrates the problem of ending sanctions (EWF 3). in 1974 the US Congress adopted the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act that imposed the sanction of not offering MFN status to any country with a non-market economy that restricted freedom of emigration and human rights (verona, 2012). This was a response to Table 6. Western economic warfare and sanctions against the ussR: 1917-1945. sources: Author's calculations, 2015.

(1997 and Ericson (1999);1941-1945: Harrison (1985. for discussions of its continuation in the post-communist period). The second case relates to the comprehensiveness of participation in sanctions (EWF 5) and to divisions between the USA and Europe. in response to the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 by the USSR and the adoption of martial law in Poland in 1981, the USA imposed draconian controls on the export to the USSR of energy-related technologies (as well as a 1980 grain embargo) and asked its NATO partners to participate. However, West Europe decided to ignore the US sanctions and instead to cooperate with the USSR in building the 4500 km natural gas pipeline from the Urengoi gas fields to Ukraine during 1982-1984(CiA, 1981.",

The world community was appalled and additional sanctions were imposed on the USSR in response (Goodrich, 1988). But after 1985 the Western powers quietly removed them in order to work constructively with the new reformist Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.

By the 1960s the USSR had a well-organised and effective Spetsinformatsiya (special information) system that involved the intelligence services (KGB (Komitet Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti), GRU (Glavnoe Razvedyvatel'noe Upravlenie)) covertly collecting restricted Western technologies on a large scale in accordance with detailed plans produced by the Military-Industrial Commission and KGB Directorate T (HP 6).

Two features of anti-Russia economic sanctions have undermined their effectiveness: participation and outsourcing. The sanctions have had the support of important countries with a collective GDP of US$42.5 trillion. However, Table 9 shows that seven major industrial countries (Brazil, China, india, indonesia, iran, South Korea and Turkey) with collective GDP of US$31.5 trillion declined to participate. This indicates that there is a major problem with EWF 5 (Comprehensiveness) in that current sanctions are much leakier than the marginally effective ones of the Cold War CoCom period. 17 The second problem is that NATO countries have transferred much of their electronic and high-technology production to lower wage non-participating countries, unlike in the more controlled Cold War period. 18 This globalisation of defence production and procurement has facilitated Russian trade diversion and covert acquisition of technology (EWF 7, HP 6).",

This external shock lowered Russia's dollar earnings from energy exports, which weakened the financial positions of its banks, businesses and government. Russia has been able to use its RMS (HP 4) and substantial stabilisation funds (the Reserve Fund and Sovereign Wealth Fund), that were developed from past high taxation on energy exports, to buffer the adverse impacts of sanctions on the population, corporations and the financial sector. But the lower oil price has reduced revenue flows through the RMS and prevented the replenishment of the stabilisation funds.",

With respect to Ukraine, it imposed restrictions on exports of agricultural and industrial goods to Russia, cut energy subsidies and demanded pre-payment of gas supplies. 19 it banned imports of food from the countries imposing sanctions and made efforts to find alternative suppliers in non-participating nations. in March 2015 Russia prohibited Western iT firms based in Russia from bidding for state contracts (about 70% of their in-country revenue) if they are observing Western restrictions on doing business in Crimea. in November 2015 the Russian government required all state agencies to purchase Russian-sourced software (e.g. for spreadsheets) instead of foreign products (e.g. Excel) from the start of 2016. in an unrelated action, but one relevant to this article, Russia imposed economic sanctions on Turkey (restrictions of charter flights for tourists, removal of visa-free travel, suspension of investment projects, a ban on hiring Turkish citizens) in late November 2015 in response to the Turkish air force using a US-supplied F-16 to shoot down a Russian bomber engaged in ground attacks against Turkomen insurgents in north Syria (BBC, 2015). Several Russian government import-substitution policies have been supported by large budget allocations. Russia proceeded with the formation of the EEU in January 2015 with the other member states of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Russian institutions have explored options for obtaining substitute finance in alternative financial centres in Asia (Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai). However, according to Connolly (2015b) Asia was the source of only 10% of loans to Russian businesses in 2015. in light of the Western embargo on exports of military equipment (e.g. helicopter carriers from France), Russia has been moving back toward self-sufficiency in defence. it has revived aspects of the priority protection system in the economy, as indicated by President Putin becoming Head of the State Commission for Military-Industrial Issues in September 2014 (see Figure 2). Russia has re-energised its Spetsinformatsiya system and relevant institutions are engaged in trade diversion and in the covert acquisition of banned technologies and finance (EWF 7).",

However, it is almost impossible to measure the economic impacts of sanctions because of the disruption caused by the drop in oil prices and lack of information of the effectiveness of Russian counter-measures. The World Bank (2015b) presented an interesting analysis of this topic, but it had weaknesses concerning sources and methods, and almost every tentative conclusion had several qualifications following it. 21 in assessing the macroeconomic impacts of sanctions on Russia, the counter-factual of the oil price not falling should be considered. if Russia had continued to receive payments of $115 per barrel from June 2014, then it is likely that many of the negative phenomena in the Russian economy (capital outflows, exchange rate depreciation, low FDi, negative growth, diminished stabilisation funds) would not have developed, even with sanctions. in reality the oil price did drop, so sanctions must be assessed in conjunction with the decline in Russia's hard-currency energy earnings.

These have had significant direct and indirect negative local effects, in that companies have withdrawn from Crimea (e.g. McDonalds of Ukraine), avoided investment there, and have suspended services (e.g. licences for computer games and software). However, the experienced and pervasive Russian/Ukrainian 'second economy' (HP 2) has provided substitutes ('pirate' copies) for some withdrawn goods and services that cannot be measured by international organisations or US government analysts in Washington, DC. Furthermore, countries not participating in sanctions, such as Turkey up to November 2015, have been active in capital investment projects in Crimea. However, the Russian government has been forced to make investments in Crimea or related to it (e.g. infrastructure, tourist facilities) that might have been financed externally in the absence of sanctions. 22 The embargo on exports to Russia of weapons and military equipment has been effective in the official sphere. This has reduced Russia's spending on imports (e.g. warships from France), but has increased its investment in import substitution. Russia probably has acquired some smaller items of banned military equipment through trade diversion and military technologies (e.g. blueprints for reverse engineering) through economic espionage (EWF 7, HP 6). The sanctions have disrupted supply and production plans in the defence sector. The main political impact of these sanctions has been to encourage Russia to return to self-sufficiency in the defence field. Several assessments suggest that these compensatory efforts (e.g. substitution of defence-related imports from Ukraine) will meet with limited success in the short-term, but could pay off in the medium/long-term.",

By 2015 there was some evidence that economic sanctions were disrupting general scientific R&D in Russia (e.g. Western firms refusing to export scientific equipment out of concern that it might be used in the military sphere), although most of the problems were caused by the depreciation of the ruble and international organisations responding of new Russian legislation restricting the activities of NGOs (Dezhina, 2015).",

These restrictions have generated capital outflows because Russian firms have needed to convert ruble funds to cover foreign obligations and have reduced FDi in Russia (see Note 10). Some defence-related firms have found it impossible to pursue planned projects with foreign partners. However, the Russian government has assisted targets of sanctions and, in any event, much of Russian external debt obligations are with Russian entities (about one-half of repayments in 2015-2016) and can therefore be easily re-scheduled (Connolly, 2015b). Furthermore, informal channels (the well-documented Russian second economy) (HP 2) have been used to obtain financing in the complicated global financial system that has demonstrated clearly over the past five years that it cannot be regulated effectively by USA/ UK government agencies (e.g. uncontrolled sub-prime lending, tolerance of incompetent borrowing strategies of banks, fraudulent derivatives, cheating on LiBOR, swindling the population through unnecessary loan insurance, money laundering for drug cartels). it will be challenging for the hastily organised EU/USA compliance teams to ensure that financial sanctions are not comprehensively subverted by talented Russians working in the global financial sector and intelligence agencies. The most important impact of these Western financial sanctions probably has been to make the most market-oriented of Russian firms and banks become more dependent on the Russian state (Gaddy & ickes, 2014b).",

The loss of Russian subsidies (HP 5) has been offset by the iMF/EU/USA, which have taken on long-term financial responsibility for propping up the malfunctioning economy of Ukraine on the condition of adherence to a package of deep reforms and restructuring and financial austerity similar to the one developed to deal with the debt crisis in Greece. it is possible, though, that a new round of bilateral sanctions in late 2015-early 2016 could cause greater problems for Ukraine in the future. These include Ukraine cutting off electricity supplies to Crimea, banning Russian airlines from flying through its airspace and restricting exports to Russia. in response Russia has banned additional Ukrainian imports, reduced deliveries of coal and natural gas, and refused to re-schedule bond repayments.",

Due to the traumatic experiences of World War ii, NATO countries and the USSR were committed to converting economic power into military capabilities and to maintaining combat readiness. These policies resulted in the USSR devoting around 15% of GDP to defence in the mid-1980s and in the leading NATO countries accepting relatively heavy defence burdens for democracies in peacetime: USA 6%, UK 5%, France 4% and Germany 3%. Although these military efforts strained economies (especially that of the USSR) and entailed significant opportunity costs, they contributed to peace in Europe, stability of borders, and nuclear and conventional deterrence.",

However, the Soviet Union developed a unique, insulated military economic system (central planning and rationing, high priority, technological espionage) that enabled it to mobilise its limited resources to become the dominant European industrial and military power (Figure 1, Table 2). However, the exceptionally heavy defence burden and well-known flaws in the general economic and political systems contributed to the collapse of the USSR. Most institutional features of the Soviet defence sector were carried over to the Russian Federation (Figure 2). However, in the 1990s the priority of the military-industrial complex declined and the armed forces, defence industry and military R&D experienced severe economic difficulties. The situation changed for the better in the 2000s as a result of economic recovery and the raised priority of national security programmes. As in the past, the top leadership is closely involved in managing the military-industrial complex (e.g. President Putin is head of both the Security Council and the State Commission for Military-Industrial Issues). The conflicts during 2013-2016 in Ukraine and Syria demonstrate that the Russian economy can generate necessary military capabilities and that the leadership has the will to employ them.",

The drastic cuts in defence spending, down to an average of 1.6% of GDP in NATO Europe, adversely affected NATO's conventional military capabilities and deterrence. This meant that Russia did not need to take NATO into account when it was formulating its military strategy to deal with the Ukraine crisis. The efforts by NATO to move troops and military equipment closer to Eastern borders have been justified on the basis that they will deter Russia from future aggressive actions against NATO members. During 2014-2016 only the UK and Poland were meeting the agreed NATO defence burdens target of 2%, although several other countries (e.g. Estonia) made commitments to reach that target by 2020 (iiSS, 2015).",

The wide-ranging trade controls of CoCom achieved some successes. But the robust counter-measure Spetsinformatsiya system enabled the USSR to obtain controlled goods and secrets through trade diversion and technological espionage.

The assessments in Table 10 suggest that the sanctions imposed on Russia (bans on individuals, prohibitions of transactions in Crimea, embargoes on exports of military goods and some energy-related technologies, and restrictions on the availability of finance) have had relatively minor impacts. The effectiveness of economic sanctions has been undermined by the limited participation by major economies (Table 9), restraints on the rigour of measures in order to maintain the USA-EU alliance, and the usual covert counter-measures by Russia. if world market prices of oil had not dropped by over 60% during 2014-2016, it is likely that anti-Russia sanctions would have had negligible macroeconomic impacts. But given actual economic developments, it is reasonable to conclude both that economic sanctions have imposed marginal microeconomic and macroeconomic costs on Russia and that they have not influenced in a pro-Western manner either public opinion or the national security decision making of the elite in that country. Notes 1. The close relationships between economic power and national security are recognised both in the academic literature (see below) and by contemporary European leaders. When introducing the Strategic Defence and Security Review in November 2015, UK Prime Minister David Cameron wrote: 'Economic security and national security go hand in hand. So at the heart of our strategy is our decision to see through our long-term economic plan and use our renewed economic strength to invest further in our security' (Cameron, 2015). in April 2015 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble stated that 'in the long term, the conflict with Putin's Russia will be decided only on the basis of economic strength \u2026 European sanctions are definitely having an impact on Putin's Russia. But we can afford these sanctions only because -and as long as -we have a strong economy' (Brookings institution, 2015). 2. These hidden processes are described in more detail and evaluated by Davis (2014aDavis ( , 2016.",

            "text": "The latter paper shows the structural similarities in the mathematical equations representing the processes of Negative Value Added, Rent Extraction and Implicit Subsidisation of East Europe. 3. Kennedy (1988) evaluates the general dynamics of the Russian Empire and the USSR, as well as specific issues related to Ukraine, such as Russia's annexation of Crimea in 1783 and its relations with Ukraine and Poland (see map on p. 109). 4. Davis (1999) contains a comparative economic systems analysis of industrialisation and industrial policy in Russia/USSR, with sections on the Russian Empire, New Economic Policy, Stalin economy, Brezhnev period and the Russian Federation in the 1990s. 5. The low-key USA treatment of the annexation of the Baltic States by the USSR in 1940 contrasts with its more robust current policies toward Russia in connection with the annexation of Crimea in 2014. 6. The assessments of the ineffectiveness of arms transfers to weak governments by superpowers provides background evidence related to the debate over NATO arms supplies to Ukraine discussed on p.14. 7. Connolly (2015a) correctly points out that the Russian economy possessed not only the two sectors identified in the virtual economy model of negative value-added heavy industry (A) and the rent-generating energy sector (B), but also a growing competitive private sector (services and industries) (C) with hard budget constraints and profit orientation. 8. Huntington (1996, p. 165) claimed that Ukraine is a 'cleft country' that contains a 'civilizational fault line' between areas with backgrounds in Western empires and those rooted in Russian Orthodoxy and suggested that this could lead to the fragmentation of the country. See related maps on pp. 159 and 166. 9. Russian energy-related subsidies of Armenia, Belarus and Ukraine were continuations into the transition period of the Soviet practice of implicitly subsidising East European countries (Marrese & vanous, 1983) discussed above. 10. Cumulative FDi inflows per capita over 1989-2008 were $4492 for Central Europe and the Baltic States, but only $899 for Ukraine and $304 for Russia (EBRD, 2009, p. 27), so foreign finance was of limited significance to Russia. 11. Although in the period before the Ukraine crisis NATO would not accept the argument that the actions of its European member countries in reducing defence expenditures and military capabilities were undermining conventional deterrence, it is noticeable that since 2014 NATO has justified its redeployments of troops and weapon systems to East Europe and the Baltic states and calls for increased defence spending by claiming that these measures will help to deter future aggressive military moves by Russia. 12. iMF (2014) announced a $17 billion support package in April 2014, and subsequently dispersed $4.5 billion of it. in February 2015 a new $17.5 billion conditional loan was approved to replace the initial one (iMF, 2015b). The EC provided Ukraine with Macro-Financial Assistance loans of (in millions) \u20ac100 (May 2014), \u20ac500 (June 2014), \u20ac260 (November 2014), \u20ac500 (December 2014) and \u20ac250 (April 2015). it has approved an additional \u20ac1.5 billion in assistance for Ukraine (EC, 2015). 13. President Putin has a historical perspective on economic sanctions that has similarities with the one presented in this paper. in his 2014 State of the Nation speech he stated: 'Speaking of the sanctions, they are not just a knee-jerk reaction on behalf of the United States or its allies to our position regarding the events and the coup in Ukraine, or even the so-called Crimean Spring. i'm sure that if these events had never happened \u2026 they would have come up with some other excuse to try to contain Russia's growing capabilities, affect our country in some way, or even take advantage of it. The policy of containment was not invented yesterday. it has been carried out against our country for many years, always, for decades, if not centuries. in short, whenever someone thinks that Russia has become too strong or independent, these tools are quickly put into use' (Putin, 2014). 14.

Economic relations between Russia and Turkey deteriorated in November 2015 due to the latter shooting down a Sukhoi 24 bomber belonging to the former in Syrian airspace in November 2015. in response to this incident Russia imposed wide-ranging economic sanctions on Turkey, which shifted the latter country into the anti-Russia sanctions category identified in Table 9. 18. vernon and Kapstein (1991) edited a special issue of Daedalus that examined the break-down of the Cold War practice of maintaining national capabilities in defence industries as a result of the seemingly inexorable trend toward globalisation. Over the past 25 years no NATO defence sector has been able to sustain autonomous military R&D and production capabilities. instead, many critical components of weapons/sensor production have been out-sourced to low-cost high-tech countries, such as the People's Republic of China. Russia and China have established close links in the technological espionage and weapons production spheres. 19. Gaddy and ickes (2014a) point out that Russia is the sole market for many Ukrainian industrial goods because of historically-determined technological compatibilities and their uncompetitive characteristics. So Ukraine's embargo on exports of industrial products to Russia is likely to mean that its firms will not find alternative customers. Some Russian industrial firms face similar difficulties due to Ukrainian restrictions on imports. 20. All statistics for Russia and Ukraine for 2015-2016 are the best estimates as of January 2016. 21. in World Bank (2015b) Part 3. The Economic Impact of Sanctions the authors mention several quantitative methodologies that could be applied to study Russia sanctions, but are not used in the actual analysis. They attempt to draw out lessons for the current situation in Russia from the history of economic sanctions against South Africa in the 1980s. No references are made to the history of Western sanctions directed against the USSR and Russia or counter-measures (Tables 6, 7 and 8 of this article). No Russian language secondary or archive sources are cited in this study, which is typical for a product of an international organisation. 22. in March 2015 former Russia Finance Minister Kudrin estimated the direct costs to Russia to that date of the support of Crimea to be about $7 billion and that the combination of direct and indirect costs (some generated by sanctions) over three years would amount to around $150 billion (TASS, 2015). 23.
