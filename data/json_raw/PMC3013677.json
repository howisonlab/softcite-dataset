            "text": "Alternative splicing is emerging as a major mechanism for the expansion of the transcriptome and proteome diversity, particularly in human and other vertebrates. However, the proportion of alternative transcripts and proteins actually endowed with functional activity is currently highly debated. We present here a new release of ASPicDB which now provides a unique annotation resource of human protein variants generated by alternative splicing. A total of 256 939 protein variants from 17 191 multi-exon genes have been extensively annotated through state of the art machine learning tools providing information of the protein type (globular and transmembrane), localization, presence of PFAM domains, signal peptides, GPIanchor propeptides, transmembrane and coiledcoil segments. Furthermore, full-length variants can be now specifically selected based on the annotation of CAGE-tags and polyA signal and/or polyA sites, marking transcription initiation and termination sites, respectively. The retrieval can be carried out at gene, transcript, exon, protein or splice site level allowing the selection of data sets fulfilling one or more features settled by the user. The retrieval interface also enables the selection of protein variants showing specific differences in the annotated features. ASPicDB is available at http://www .caspur.it/ASPicDB/.",

In particular, it is now widely demonstrated that virtually all multi-exon genes may generate multiple transcripts and protein variants (3,4) and that the splicing process is tightly regulated in different physiological conditions, tissues or developmental stages (5). Furthermore, alterations of the splicing process can be observed in several genetic diseases and in cancer (6)(7)(8)(9)(10).",

The alternative splicing pattern of human multi-exon genes, determined by ASPIC, has been collected in ASPicDB, a database resource which presents some unique features with respect to other similar databases (15). The ASPIC algorithm implements an optimization strategy that, performing a multiple alignment of all available transcript data (including full-length cDNA and EST sequences) to the relevant genome sequence, detects the set of introns that minimizes the number of splicing sites. It also generates through a directed-acyclic graph combinatorial procedure the minimal set of non-mergeable transcript isoforms compatible with the detected splicing events (14). The reliability of splicing isoforms detected by ASPIC has been recently established through a comparative assessment (16).",

            "text": "The third layer of annotation results from the integration of several predictors based on machine learning tools, such as neural networks, hidden Markov models, support vector machines and conditional random fields. Since most of the methods take advantage of the evolutionary information encoded in sequence profiles, we compiled them starting from the similar sequences retrieved with two PSI-BLAST iterations (setting the E-value threshold to 10 \u00c03 ) from the UniRef90 data set consisting of 6 955 504 sequences (July 2010). The first predicted features are the presence of N-terminal signal peptide and of C-terminal GPI-anchor propeptides, with SPEPlip (32) and PredGPI (33), respectively. Both the methods are among the best available predictors, scoring with accuracy as high as 95% the former and 88% the latter. When present, the signal peptide and the propeptide are cleaved from the protein sequence. The presence of coiled-coil domains is predicted with CCHMM-PROF that is able to locate coiled-coil segments in protein sequences with 80% accuracy (34). a-Helical transmembrane domains are then predicted with ENSEMBLE (35), that discriminates transmembrane from globular proteins with false positive and false negative rates both equal to 3%. The same tool is adopted for predicting the number and the position of transmembrane segments along the sequence, with an accuracy of 90% on the protein base. The subcellular localization of globular proteins is predicted with BaCelLo (36), which discriminates four localizations in animals (secretory pathway, cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondrion) with 74% accuracy. Table 1 reports some statistics on the data contained in the current version of ASPicDB (version 2.0, August 2010) which refers only to human multi-exon genes annotated in NCBI Entrez Gene (37) with at least one RefSeq transcript (38) and the relevant Unigene cluster (39) collecting all available gene-specific cDNA and EST sequences.",

At the gene level, 30 and 92% of genes encode for transmembrane and globular proteins, respectively. Since the sum exceed 100%, it follows that 22% of the genes encode for both globular and transmembrane variants. The same consideration holds for the other annotations as reported in Table 4. The amount of genes predicted to encode for proteins with different subcellular localization achieves 56%. This is partially explained by the fact that BaCelLo scores with an accuracy equal to 74%, which is the lowest among the methods included in the pipeline. Indeed the discrimination between the 'cytoplasmic' and the 'nuclear' classes is still a difficult task for all subcellular localization predictors (40). When the two classes are merged together, the BaCelLo accuracy increases up to 91%, but the rate of genes encoding for proteins with different localizations is still as high as 44%, suggesting that localization diversity is inherent in the ASPicDB protein variants. The structure of PFAM annotations is also highly variable: 38% of genes encode for variants matching with different number and/or type of PFAM models. Altogether, results listed in Table 4 suggest that alternative transcripts can encode for proteins endowed with different structural and functional features. ASPicDB provides a unique resource reporting the annotation of alternative splicing variants at the protein level and an interface enabling the discovery of such differences.",

We also plan to update alternative splicing prediction by using the huge amount of RNA-Seq data which are now being produced by next generation sequencing, possibly annotating splicing events as constitutive or tissue-specific. Furthermore, literaturescreened splicing patterns related to diseases will be annotated as they represent potential molecular biomarkers and possible targets for therapy. Finally, the inclusion in the database of data related to other organisms will certainly favor a better understanding of the alternative splicing process through comparative analyses.  . 'Predicted proteins' panel for gene CSMD3 (CUB and Sushi multiple domains 3). The gene is predicted to encode for 12 transcripts and 7 different protein sequences. Variants labeled as PR1, PR2 and PR3 are identical to the isoforms reported in the CSMD3_HUMAN entry of SwissProt/UniprotKB. Two more variants are reported in that file, although lacking of experimental annotations. Several repetitions of Sushi and CUB domains are predicted with PFAM (25) and represented with symbols indicating whether the model is completely or partially mapped to the sequence. The two transmembrane helices are predicted with ENSEMBLE (35).",
