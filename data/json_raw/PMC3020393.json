The ROS levels, cytochrome C reductions, and intracellular ATP levels were measured. The coding region and the D-Loop region were amplified and sequenced. Results showed the ROS levels, cytochrome C reduction and mtDNA mutations were markedly increased and cell viability decreased after treatment with both Hp extracts, and 616 mutations were detected in D-Loop region and 3 heteroplasmic point mutations in the Cytb gene. No mutations were found in the coding region. The mutation rates of mtDNA D-Loop region were positively correlated with the ROS levels and negatively to the ATP levels.",

            "text": "Helicobacter pylori (Hp) are Gram-negative microaerophilic bacteria. Hp infection represents a key factor in the etiology of various gastrointestinal diseases, ranging from chronic active gastritis without clinical symptoms to peptic ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. H. pylori-positive patients have a 10 to 20% lifetime risk of developing ulcer disease and a 1 to 2% risk of developing distal gastric cancer [1]. The cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) protein and vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) protein are the main virulence factors of Hp and closely relevant with the occurrence of gastric ulcer and carcinoma [2]. Most H. pylori strains secrete VacA into the extracellular space. After exposure of VacA to acidic or basic pH, re-oligomerized VacA (mainly 6 monomeric units) at neutral pH is more toxic [3]. CagA (120-145 kDa protein) is a highly anti-genic protein that is associated with a prominent inflammatory response. It has a pathogenic effect on gastric and duodenal mucosa leading to the development of peptic ulcers [4].",

            "text": "Studies have shown that Hp can induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and programmed cell death in human gastric epithelial cells [5,6]. ROS are produced as a normal product of cellular metabolism and include superoxide anion (O 2 \u2022\u02c9), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), hydroxyl radical (HO\u2022), nitric oxide (NO\u2022), etc. They are highly reactive due to the presence of unpaired valence shell electrons and can diffuse only an extremely short distance before they dissipate. Elevated levels of ROS have been implicated in cellular physiological and pathological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, carcinogenesis, etc [7]. Mitochondria are the centre of energy metabolism in the cell and a major source of ROS. The proportion of oxygen converted into O 2 \u2022\u02c9accounts for about 1-2 % of the overall oxygen consumption [8]. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an extranuclear genetic material. mtDNA is particularly susceptible to ROS generated by the respiratory chain due to its close proximity and lack of protective histones, and inefficient DNA repair systems [9].",

In the study of Machado et al [12], they speculate, following Hp infection, the activity and expression of base excision repair and mismatch repair are down-regulated both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Hp induces genomic instability in nuclear CA repeats in mice and in mtDNA of AGS cells and chronic gastritis tissue, and this effect in mtDNA is associated with bacterial virulence. Furthermore, the DNA damage induced genetic exchange may facilitate spread of antibiotic resistance and selection of fitter variants through re-assortment of preexisting alleles in this important human pathogen [19].

Hp can induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from gastric epithelial cells resulting in the increased generation of ROS in gastric epithelial cells [24].

            "text": "In the present study, extract was obtained from VacA positive and VacA negative HP. The stimulation of ROS production by VacA, an important virulence factor of Hp, has been demonstrated in numerous studies. Kimura et al revealed VacA purified from Hp could cause mitochondrial damage (impair mitochondrial membrane potential followed by a decrease in energy metabolism) [11], which may be a cause of excessive production of ROS. This effect was confirmed by Kim et al [27]. Furthermore, VacA from Hp could also impaired glutathione metabolism which alleviates the anti-oxidative potency [28]. These effects result in excessive generation of ROS and compromised anti-oxidative potency. These effects may also explain why the ROS levels in AGS cells stimulated by Hp11638 extract were significantly higher than those in cells treated by Hp11638M extract at the corresponding concentrations. Therefore, Hp infection may involve in many gastrointestinal diseases through excessive ROS production in the mucosa, the pronounced membrane damage, and the depletion of gastric anti-oxidants [29]. The ROS not only causes damage to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, but compromises the DNA repair. The mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is an important mechanism involving in the DNA repair. Studies have shown Hp infection can down-regulate the expressions of MMR in vivo and in vitro [30]  [12]. ROS cause damage to not only nuclear DNA, but mtDNA. mtDNA mutations have been detected in Hp-infected chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer tissues, suggesting that Hp infection contributes to the accumulation of mutations in mtDNA at early steps of gastric cancer development [31]. In the study of Machado et al., their results showed Hp infection resulted in increased mutations in the non-coding D-loop as well as the coding genes ND1 and COI of mtDNA of gastric cells [12]. The increase in the number of mutations was mainly attributed to a rise of transitions, possibly a consequence of oxidative damage. The increase in mtDNA mutations was dependent on the bacterial virulence factors. The changes in mtDNA in peptic ulcer tissues may further impair the ATP synthesis and increase the mtDNA copy number to compensate for the deficiency in ATP. During this perturbation, mitochondria might produce a large amount of ROS, causing the vicious cycle in peptic ulcer disease [13].",

These findings further confirmed that the increased ROS levels and the elevated mutation rates as well as the decreased cell viability were caused by the Hp extracts.

Second, Machado et al compared the mtDNA sequence post-stimulation with that from database, while, in the present study, the mtDNA sequence of AGS cells after stimulation was compared with that at baseline which avoids the false increase in the mutation rate due to variance in certain loci of mtDNA between AGS cells and normal human cells.

            "text": "MtDNA contains several mono-and dinucleotide repeats. The ones most frequently used to test mtGI are a (CA)n microsatellite starting at 514 bp position of the D-loop [33] and a homopolymeric C tract extending from 16,184 to 16,193 bp of the D-loop, which is interrupted by a T at 16,189 bp position [34]. In human populations, the mtCA microsatellite shows seven different alleles varying in size by one repeat. On the other hand, the (16184)C homopolymer exhibits two forms: the stable one in which all mt-genomes of an individual have equal-length tracts (usually 10 bp long) and the unstable one in which the mt-genomes of a given individual are a mosaic of C tracts varying in length from 8 to 14 nucleotides. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the mechanism of length variation shows that a T\u2192C transition in the T nucleotide at 16189 bp position is the primary cause of instability [34]. In our study, mutations were found in 17 out of 20 samples after stimulation by Hp extracts and included C deletion in the 303PolyC region, CA deletion in the D514CA repeats and T\u2192C replacement at the 16189 bp position of 16184PolyC. Previous studies have found that most of mtDNA mutations are T\u2192C; G\u2192A replacement [32,35]. In this study, 616 mutations were identified in the D-Loop region of mtDNA, including 489 point mutations, 81 insertions and 46 deletions, and 89.4% of point mutations (437/489) were G \u2192 A; C\u2192T and A \u2192 G; T\u2192C conversion.",

In addition, mtDNA mutation results in the reduction of ATP synthesized in mitochondria and affect cell viability. Both the pathogenic factors of Hp (VacA and CagA), especially the VacA, play an important role in the Hp induced mtDNA mutation. We speculate that the accumulation of Hp induced mtDNA mutation is likely to be one of critical mechanisms underlying the carcinogenic effects of Hp.",
