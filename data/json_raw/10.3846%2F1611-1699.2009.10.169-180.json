The knowledge of the leadership and workers in OH&S is not suffi cient at present in Estonia, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises (the number is 60 000). The small (up to 50 workers) or medium-sized enterprises (up to 150 workers) have no possibility to hire the working environment specialist who would deal only with OH&S problems. Usually obligations in the fi eld of OH&S in small and medium-sized enterprises are delegated to one employee in addition to other responsibilities related to personnel, security, fi re protection and environmental problems. Therefore, the complex approach to management of OH&S issues is needed in order to create a good safety culture and to achieve positive results in company safety performance. The complex method consists of risk assessment and determination of safety level. The authors offer possible tools-simple computer applications which are available for managers, interviews with employers, employees and occupational health specialists for development and dissemination of safety culture. The opinion of workers and occupational health specialists has been taken into consideration in the planning of improvements of working conditions by the employers. The economic issues of safety and health improvement measures are presented.",

These processes may be studied at different levels of analyses and even at different levels of analyses simultaneously (Cheyne et al. 2008). Safety culture contains three interacting elements: risk controls, attitudes and behaviour, and its effective development depends on good cooperation and communications between employers, employees and Occupational Health Services (OHS). In Estonia, the services provided by an occupational health physician, an occupational health nurse, an occupational hygienist, a psychologist or a specialist of ergonomics are considered to be OHS. These service providers are all called 'occupational health specialists' (OHsp). According to the Estonian Act on Occupational Health and Safety, only entrepreneurs or private medical companies may provide the OHS.",

Ultimately, the formulation of policies on OHS must be both economically and ethically sound (Meng 2005;Grozdanovic 2001).",

Only an estimated 5-10% of the workers in developing countries and 20-50% of the workers in industrialized countries (85% in Finland, (Walters 1996) have access to adequate OHS. Relatively little information is available on the process and customers of OHS. The only indications of the coverage and contents of OHS are obtained indirectly form the information labour inspectors gather annually from employers. In addition, only a minority (22%) of workers is covered by the OHS and has access to the occupational health physician in Estonia (J\u00e4rvis and Tint 2007). Even in a developed country like the United States, approximately 70% of the 100 million workforce are not covered by OHS (Somavia 2005). The OHS have been endorsed by both the WHO and the ILO as a prescription for a healthier, happier, and more productive workforce.",

            "text": "Although a healthier workforce will almost certainly mean decreased absenteeism and increased workers' compensation claims, one must still weigh the benefi ts against the costs and seek the most cost-effective way of achieving the same results. In the estimation of the benefi ts, a monetary value is apportioned to the avoided consequences (for example costs of health care, rehabilitation, or workers' compensation). The analysis should also take into consideration the fact that costs and benefi ts may be generated over a period of time, the costs and benefi ts often occurring in different time periods. Because costs or benefi ts 10 years later are not directly comparable with their value today. The effects on productivity and reduced sickness absence can also be quantifi ed and refl ected as savings. More sophisticated forms of cost-benefi t analyses would factor other intangible benefi ts into the equation. Providing employees with on-site primary health care may give them a sense of loyalty to the company because the company is demonstrating that it cares for its employees. The full economic losses due to accidents are not demonstrated clearly in Estonia. Data from the Health Insurance Fund (responsible for public health care in Estonia) have been publicly ac-cessible only in two recent years. However, these data (Table 1) do not contain the indirect costs of accidents and diseases (the costs for hiring the substitute labour, training for the job, the lost or degraded production quality, etc.). At present, the coverage for occupational accidents and occupational diseases are integrated into the Estonian health insurance (temporary loss of work ability) and pension insurance (permanent loss of work ability) schemes. The system of occupational disability and occupational accidents insurance is voluntary in Estonia and not effective (J\u00e4rvis and Tint 2007).",

            "text": "Many companies have embarked on the road to establish safe working cultures in order to improve their safety performance. The so-called behaviour-based safety programs are the vehicles to achieve this desired outcome (Gadomski 2008). Indeed, some companies have experienced huge improvements in their safety performance while others, however, utterly failed (Pheiffer 2008). The behaviour-based safety program accepts that risk-taking is essential and fundamental to doing work and that no work at the workplace can ever be made risk-free. Therefore, the focus should be that employees become competent to identify and assess risks and act appropriately. This approach specifi cally targets the complacency factor, which is a natural result if people perceive their work environments and procedures to be safe. One of the tools in achieving safety is to focus on employees' behaviour and attitudes. In order to encourage the employees to achieve high safety standards the managers must lead by the models of the behaviour that include risk awareness tools, motivational tools and behaviour observations. Over the years companies have installed many programs and processes to prevent incidents and to control losses. According to Germain et al. (1998) some companies believe that the best way to achieve incident control is through additional regulations, focusing on prescriptive and technological approach, there is also a merging willingness by people in industry and business to try a new and complementary approach. This approach is then effective safety management through good management systems. It is clear that there is a direct link between good safety management systems and good business management (Wallace 1995). Organisations with high safety standards are those with high operational standards because the management actions necessary to achieve safety are the same which are required to achieve business effi ciency. Over time various safety approaches were indeed developed and implemented by companies to assist them in the managing of safety and include engineering design, legal approach, safety systems, risk management and more recently behaviour-based safety. The aim is to change employees' perception and attitudes (at all levels) toward s safety behaviour, so that they understand the role and impact of their own behaviours on safety. The way, in which employees understand risks, their attitudes towards safety and taking the responsibility of safety of the person himself and the others are important factors in good safety culture. There are three major factors which infl uence employee behaviour: the company safety culture, which should promote involvement and commitment to the company goals and standards; the job itself; the strengths and weaknesses of the employee, which include habits, attitudes, personality and current stresses (Wallace 1995). New demands from the companies' environment entail that work safety becomes strategically more important for management (J\u00e4rvis and Tint 2007;Reinhold and Tint 2007). The safety management system consists of the following elements (thematic areas): management and leadership, training of management and personnel, operations, maintenance, risk assessment, emergency planning, monitoring of performance and audit (Machaira et al. 2008).",

The objective of the questionnaire was to gather information about the workers' knowledge of the occupational risks connected with their occupation, possible work-related occupational hazards, and attitudes towards using personal protective equipment and safety routines. Ques-tions about the workers' opinions and their perceptions about the exposure to occupational risks (noise, chemicals, vibration, bad microclimate, insuffi cient lighting, and ergonomics), experienced health symptoms and their awareness of the Occupational Health and Safety Act were also asked. The workers were randomly selected from textile, printing, mechanical, plastic, food processing industries and offi ces. A questionnaire was distributed to 412 workers in investigated industries. The average age was 43.6 years. Confi dentiality of information was always maintained and only coded information was used in the analysis. Data collected on the questionnaire study was coded and then entered into the statistical software programme (Excel) for analyses. The investigation gave results as follows: 1. 65% of workers considered excessive exposure to noise, 60% bad microclimate (too cold workrooms), 54% bad lighting at workplaces; not-effective ventilation was the main occupational risk factor (75% of workplaces). 2. Only some of the workers (10%) answered that they know which information about the dangerousness of chemicals may be obtained from the chemical labels. Nobody of respondents pointed at the chemical safety data sheets as one of the important source of information. 3. Most of the workers (80%) reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) was accessible; however, the questionnaire did not show the attitudes towards using PPE. Some of the respondents (36%) pointed that the PPE disturbs the work; others mentioned (46%) that the quality of PPE is not very good. 4. In the present study, 63% of the workers reported that they were aware of the person who was the working environment specialist in their company. At the same time, only 20% of workers knew who was elected to be their working environment representative. 5. Different opinions were given on safety instructions and guidelines. In the present study, 25% of the workers reported that they had not received safety instructions and guidelines. The assessment of the safety instructions was made on a 6-point scale (from 0 to 5, where 0 was bad and 5 -very good). According to workers' opinion, the quality of accessed safety instruction was satisfactory (2.8 points). 6. The questionnaire revealed that only 25% were generally aware of the safety legislation.",

Psychological risk factors (also forced position, monotonous work) received the most negative assessment from different sides of working environment. It is understandable as the factor appears in the case of all fi elds of activities and different size of companies, when at the same time, for example, physical load of the job or its dangerousness appears only in the case of some fi eld of activities or occupations (printing, wood processing). Attitudes to working conditions, design/furniture of the workplace and work related daily living conditions received less negative assessments. Respondents were asked also to evaluate on a 10-point scale their employees' risk to impair their health at work. Two thirds of respondents consider the risk to their employees' health suffi ciently low (1-4 points). 15% of interviewed companies did not see any risk factors that would endanger employees' health. Industry managers mentioned as the main risk factors to the employees' health are noise (80%), vibration (70%), physical overload (50%), fl uctuation of temperature (50%) and work monotonousness (50%). Despite the fact that companies from different fi eld of activities evaluate risk factors to employees' health differently, there are no signifi cant differences in assessment of employees' sickness problems. Occupational diseases and the other health problems were bothering factors only for some (30%) of the companies. In order to assess the persons, who follow the situation of the working environment, companies' management was asked about the existence of different specialists like working environment representative or council in their companies. Only in a half of the companies the working environment representative was elected and working environment specialists were working in 30% of companies. Looking at the evaluations of different persons' effi ciency to the improvement of working environment, we can see that only some companies, where separately relevant persons exist, estimate their work as very effi cient and half up to 2/3 of interviewed companies as suffi cient. Therefore, the relevant specialists have not found suffi cient employment in their positions. In addition to specialists who work inside the company, there is a possibility to include the agreement for carrying out the working environment investigations externally. 100% of investigated companies (Cases I-VI) used the last possibility. The external specialist's help has been mainly used for conducting workplace risk assessment (including hazards' measurements) and consulting companies in the fi eld of OH&S.",

The study was carried out using a questionnaire designed for the occupational health and safety professionals. The target group for the survey were all the 103 OH&S professionals (occupational health physicians (OH physicians), OH nurses, hygienists, ergonomists, psychologists) who were practising as occupational health and safety professionals at the time of the data collection in Estonia (Kempinen and Sarap 2002). Although the response rate was low, 40%, the size of the study group was large enough to assess the major problems in the fi eld of occupational health and safety and to describe the occupational health and safety professionals' attitudes, level of education and knowledge. However, statistical analysis for the differences between the groups could not be done. The work experience in the fi eld of OH&S of the participants in the survey varied between the professional groups. OH physicians had longer work experience (the average 21.4 years) than other specialists. 60% of OH physicians and 80% of nurses worked in health care centres where they performed OHS besides other medical services. The main tasks of OH&S professionals consisted of risk assessments, workplace surveys, health examinations, advice related to work, but also health promotion activities. Most of the respondents were experienced professionals, with high level of training. The professionals stated that occupational diseases and work-related diseases (diagnostic and prevention), rehabilitation and/or promotion of work ability were the main subjects for need in further training. Also, a need for clarifying guidelines of Occupational Health and Safety, legislation and regulations in Estonia was identifi ed. 90% of OH physicians stated that they can understand Estonian, 42% of OH physicians can speak Russian; 27% can speak English and most of the physicians reported that they understand the Finnish language. Access to Internet was available for 82% of the respondents, and most of them used it for information search, on average 5 hours/week. All of the occupational health physicians and nurses answered that workers told them about work-related health problems at least weekly. Two thirds of the respondents considered, that the workers were not afraid of telling about these problems to them (Kempinen and Sarap 2002). According to OH&S professionals' responses, there are the following main priorities and major problems in the OH&S practice in Estonia: 1. The absence of Insurance Act of Occupational Accidents and Diseases. 2. The absence of the Governmental participation in the fi eld of occupational health and safety (Governmental fi nancial support). 3. It is impossible to analyse sensitive personal data. 4. The absence of an agreement between OH physicians and Health Insurance Fund in order to provide fi nancial support for the rehabilitation services. 5. There is a lack of OHS in Estonia (low coverage of the OHS services offered to employees). 6. There is insuffi cient work collaboration between Occupational Health and Safety Institutions in Estonia. 7. Lack of knowledge among employers and workers concerning the Estonian National Policy on the working environment and their awareness of OH&S is insuffi cient. 8. Lack of the OH&S professionals and of the research activities in Estonia (Kempinen and Sarap 2002).",

The most important issue at companies is the collective awareness of safety learning necessity (Kumpikait\u0117 2008;Kumpikait\u0117 and \u010ciarnien\u0117 2008). Instructions and rules are the key ways of achieving a healthy working environment and risk control. There is a concentration on observable action, both human and social. The machinery or the rules may not be fl exible when changes in production are required. It is likely that production would come out victorious in any such confl ict. The occupational disease develops by stages ( Fig. 1): some complaints, recoverable disease, non-recoverable disease. The cooperation between the employer, worker and occupational health physicians is urgent in order to achieve the positive safety culture and high safety performance at the enterprise. At present, most of the occupational diseases are diagnosed at the very last stage in Estonia. The diagnoses of occupational diseases as well as maintenance of work ability are still in the need for development in Estonian OH&S system.",
