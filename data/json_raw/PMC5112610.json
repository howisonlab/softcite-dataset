            "text": "Tubulin tyrosine ligase like 12 (TTLL12), a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTLL) family, has not been completely characterized to date. It is reported that histone methylation, tubulin modifications, mitotic duration and chromosome ploidy play crucial roles in a variety of cancers, and are related to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. A recent study showed that TTLL12 may be a pseudo-enzyme which has a SET-like domain and a TTL-like domain. In the present study, we first used 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'-RACE) to amplify the transcripts of the TTLL12 gene from a human lung cancer cell line H1299, and unexpectedly discovered a new transcript isoform characterized with an additional 108-bp nucleotide sequence inserted at the location from 902 to 903 bases of the TTLL12 coding sequence (CDS), where it also locates between exons 5 and 6. Next, utilizing RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing, we further confirmed the existence of such a new transcript isoform of TTLL12 in more human cancer cells including lung cancer cells and other cancer cells. Moreover, several lung cancer cell lines were found to display a much higher proportion of the new isoform compared with TTLL12 wild-type transcript. These results suggest that the new TTLL12 isoform may be of importance for proper maintenance of lung cancer cells. Therefore, the new isoform of TTLL12, with the inserted sequences probably acting as a disordered region, provides a novel perspective regarding TTLL12 functions in human cancers including lung cancer.",

            "text": "Tubulin tyrosine ligase like 12 (TTLL12) is the least characterized and the most divergent member of the TTLL family, which possesses catalytic functions in tubulin post-translational modifications (1)(2)(3). However, TTLL12 is said to be a pseudoenzyme having a phylogenetically conserved association of two nonfunctional domains including a SET-like domain and TTL-like domain, for which several differences exist in the structure, compared with other members of the TTLL family (4). These two domains are associated with histone methylation and tubulin modification, respectively. Recent studies have shown that TTLL12 could affect histone methylation, tubulin modification, mitotic duration and chromosome ploidy in human larynx cancer cells (5)(6)(7)(8). In addition, there are numerous studies that have revealed that the TTLL family is closely linked to human cancer, such as neuroblastomas (9)(10)(11). For example, the TTLL family is often suppressed in human cancer (10) and is positively correlated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer (11). In prostate cancer, the level of TTLL12 expression was found to be increased in the proliferating layer of benign tissue and during cancer progression to metastasis (12,13). These findings suggest that TTLL12 may display the same pattern in other types of cancers, and it could play a crucial role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression.",

The reverse transcriptase-PCR products were then used as the template for PCR. In PCR, the plasmids harboring the 36AA plus isoform and wild-type of the TTLL12 gene sequence were used as the positive templates for the 36AA plus isoform and wild-type, respectively. All the PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gel. We then located the position of the desired fragment under uv light and extracted the PCR products from the gel. Extracted PCR products were subsequently cloned into a pMD18-T Simple vector and transformed into chemically competent cells. All the plasmids from the positive clone were sequenced and aligned with the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform and TTLL12 wild-type. As a result, we found the product of the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform in all of the detected cell lines, and 3 lung cancer cell lines (H1299, H2170 and Hcc-827) showed the highest proportion of the 36AA plus isoform compared to the wild-type (Fig. 3). In addition, the sequencing results of the plasmids extracted from the positive clone were aligned, and demonstrated that the PCR products were from the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform (Fig. 4). Significantly, the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was expressed more abundantly than the wildtype in the human cancer cell lines, particularly in the human lung cancer cell lines, as compared with the human normal Figure 2. Diagrams for DNA sequences of the TTLL12 wild-type and the new TTLL12 36AA plus isoform. The new TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was found to contain an additional 108-bp nucleotide sequence which was located in the CDS from nucleotides 902 to 903, between exons 5 and 6, when aligned with the GenBank consensus Homo sapiens TTLL12 genomic sequence.

Next, we predicted the physicochemical properties by ProtParam and ProtScale. The properties of TTLL12 wild-type and 36AA plus isoform AA sequences were predicted (Table I) as follows: the total number of negatively charged residues (Asp + Glu) was 93 and 96; and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAvY) was -0.390 and -0.338. In addition, the total hydropathicities of the two types of TTLL12 proteins are displayed in diagram ( Fig. 5B and C).

TTLL12 is the least characterized and a most special member of the TTLL family, and it plays an important role in histone and tubulin modifications (14), mitotic duration and chromosome ploidy (5)(6)(7)(8). It is the only member of the TTLL family without an assigned enzymatic function (15)(16)(17), and is said to be a pseudo-enzyme that has a phylogenetically conserved association of two domains including the SET-like domain and TTL-like domain in the N-and C-terminal of TTLL12, respectively. These two domains are related to histone methylation (18)(19)(20)(21)(22) and tubulin modifications (23)(24)(25) and then may contribute to tumorigenesis (4). The TTLL family is often suppressed in human cancers (10) and is closely connected with the poor prognosis of breast cancer (11), suggesting that TTLL12 could also play roles in human cancers. It is reported that TTLL12 increases its expression in the proliferating layer of benign human prostate and more apparently during cancer progression to metastasis (12), suggesting that TTLL12 may be of importance in tumor progression.",

By the alternative splicing of precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), multiple mRNAs and proteins can be generated from a single gene, and then the coding capacity of genomes is expanded through such a major mechanism (27)(28)(29)(30)(31). Furthermore, it has been reported that aberrant alternative splicing underlies various pathological processes, in particular tumorigenesis and tumor progression (32)(33)(34). The new TTLL12 36AA plus isoform may be the result of aberrant alternative splicing. Analysis by bioinformatics software showed that there are some differences in peptide physicochemical properties and protein secondary structure between the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform and the TTLL12 wild-type, suggesting that the new 36AA plus isoform could add some distinguished functions to TTLL12.",

Proteins with disordered regions often go through disorder-to-order when binding to their partners and they can remain partially or fully flexible in their bound state, and form fuzzy complexes (37,(39)(40)(41). In contrast, proteins with disordered regions are mainly involved in enzymatic activity (37,42), including cell cycle regulation (43), cell division and differentiation (42,44), which play critical roles in different types of cancers (45). In the present study, we report that the additional 36AA in the newly found TTLL12 protein isoform is a part of the disordered region, with the identity of those disordered regions identified in other functional proteins. Whether the 36AA is the binding site for certain proteins, such as those participating in posttranslational modification of tubulin or other important cell process, still needs to be investigated. The TTLL family has been shown to be partially co-localized with vimentin and tubulin, which causes post-translational modifications of tubulin (5)(6)(7)(8). Tubulin is a well acknowledged and important target for tumor therapy (46), but the precise functions of TTLL12 in tubulin modification are still poorly understood. Proteins related to post-translational modification are targets for new cancer therapeutic agents (47,48), thus the new 36AA plus isoform of TTLL12 protein may have the potential to become a novel strategy for cancer treatment involving tubulin post-translational modifications. Therefore, the functions and molecular mechanisms of the new 36AA plus isoform in cancer development remain to be investigated.",
