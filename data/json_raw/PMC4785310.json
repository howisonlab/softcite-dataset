Methods: We conducted secondary analysis of patient experience survey data collected from 5870 patients across 25 English general practices. Mixed effect linear regression estimated the difference in composite general practitioner-patient communication scores between White British and South Asian patients, controlling for practice, patient demographics and patient language. Results: There was strong evidence of an association between doctor-patient communication scores and ethnicity. South Asian patients reported scores averaging 3.0 percentage points lower (scale of 0-100) than White British patients (95% CI \u22124.9 to \u22121.1, p=0.002). This difference reduced to 1.4 points (95% CI \u22123.1 to 0.4) after accounting for speaking a non-English language at home; respondents who spoke a non-English language at home reported lower scores than English-speakers (adjusted difference 3.3 points, 95% CI \u22126.4 to \u22120.2). Conclusions: South Asian patients rate communication lower than White British patients within the same practices and with similar demographics. Our analysis further shows that this disparity is largely mediated by language.",

            "text": "Feedback on patient experience is concerned with objective facts and subjective perceptions of the treatment process and patients' interface with the healthcare system. It reflects several domains including: patient understanding of their condition/s and treatment; involvement in decisionmaking processes; doctor-patient communication; access, support, timeliness, continuity and individual choice of care. 1 Patient experience has been increasingly valued as an important outcome for medical care, in part due to its association with other aspects of the quality of care. 1 2 Communication is an important component of patient experience, and has been shown to influence healthcare access, health outcomes and patient satisfaction. 3 Doctorpatient communication is key in either enabling or preventing the development of trusting, empathetic interpersonal relationships, the exchange of information and collaborative decision-making. 4 However, there are differences in doctor-patient communication across populations. A recent study in the UK found strong evidence to conclude that South Asian and Chinese patients report lower ratings of physician communication than White British patients in primary care",

The remaining difference may arise either because South Asian and Chinese patients rate the same care lower, or because they receive lower quality care: however, the effect of language on experiences of care was not explored. It is necessary to evaluate language with communication because communication includes and is highly influenced by language. In the healthcare field, the term 'language-concordance' describes patients and physicians sharing proficiency in the same language, and 'language-discordance' describes a lack of proficiency in a shared language. 6 Compared to White British patients, South Asian patients frequently report poorer doctor communication (regarding offering time, showing care and concern, questioning the patient, listening, explaining, and involving patient in decisionmaking); however, when language-concordant consultations are available to Bangladeshi or Pakistani patients, there is no longer a difference in these doctor-patient communication scores. 7 This suggests that languageconcordance influences patient perception of the quality of doctors' communication, possibly due to improved verbal and cultural understanding and trust. In the UK, immigration rates have risen to historically high levels, according to the Parliament's Migration Statistics report in 2015, thereby increasing the size of the population with limited English proficiency. 8 The 2011 Census noted that 11% of the non-UK born population in the UK report being unable to speak English well. 9 This population is of particular concern for language-discordant consultations, potentially inhibiting access to high-quality healthcare. 10 However, it is important to note that sizeable proportions of many minority ethnic groups-long established in their country of residence or not-report a lack of language proficiency in the official languages. 9 For example, among UK-born individuals identifying as Bangladeshi, Pakistani, or Indian, a respective 30%, 23% and 14% report not speaking English well or at all, despite the fact that 67%, 61%, and 54% of the respective populations have lived in the UK for at least 10 years. 11 Without substantial developments for incorporating culturally sensitive, multilingual healthcare training and delivery, this growing population faces major challenges accessing, navigating and utilising healthcare services.",

This inclusion criterion represented the largest ethnic groups-South Asian and White British-to provide the largest power to the study. Using univariable linear regression, we examined crude associations between each of the covariates and doctor-patient communication. We then modelled the composite communication score using three multivariable linear regression models. All models included a random effect for practice to account for the fact that South Asian patients may cluster in lower performing practices. The first model's variables included age, gender, self-rated health, and ethnicity, all previously shown to be associated with patient experience. Because the patient survey did not collect information on occupation, this could not be included in the model. The second model augmented this to include language spoken most often at home (hereafter referred to as 'language') to determine if the effect of ethnicity on the patient experience was partially attributed to language. Lastly, the third model included the model 1 variables, language and birthplace, dichotomised as UK or non-UK. Language (English vs non-English speaking) and birthplace (UK vs non-UK) were binary variables in order to maximise the power.

The first multivariable linear regression model investigated the association between doctor-patient communication and the exposure variables including practice, age, gender, self-reported health and ethnicity. There was strong evidence ( p=0.002) of an association between patient ethnicity and patient-reported doctor communication score. On average, South Asians rated doctorpatient communication 3.0 percentage points below (95% CI \u22124.9 to \u22121.1) White British patients (model 1). The second model additionally controlled for languages spoken at home. In model 2, there was some evidence ( p=0.04) of an association between language and doctor-patient communication ratings with non-English-speakers reporting doctor-patient communications scores 3.3 percentage points lower (95% CI \u22126.4 to \u22120.2) than English-speaking patients. By accounting for language, we also found the average difference between South Asian and White British scores of doctor-patient communication decreased from 3.0 percentage points (found in model 1) to 1.4 points (95% CI \u22123.1 to 0.4, p=0.13) found in model 2. Following this decrease, the difference was no longer statistically significant. This change would imply that language appears to account for around half of the observed difference between South Asian and White British patients' ratings of doctor communication. When ethnicity, language and birthplace were all included (model 3), there was only weak evidence of an association between language and doctor-patient communication rating ( p=0.07) with no evidence of an association with ethnicity or birthplace.",

            "text": "Our study's findings were consistent with previous studies showing that, in England, minority ethnic groups, particularly Asian populations, have poorer patient experiences. 5 14 Language may be a key driver of ethnic differences in patient-reported doctor communication, for minority ethnic groups with poor English proficiency often have less information provided to them and poorer information recall thereby influencing their experience, 15 and minority ethnic populations have higher ratings of physician communication when provided language-concordant consultations. 7 Additionally, physicians have been found to be less likely to respond to non-English speakers' comments and used less emotive communication when speaking to those with poor language proficiency, 15 16 which may help explain why we found that primarily non-English speakers report poorer doctor-patient communication. Studies found language, more than ethnicity, determined patient experience with doctor communication; however, this may have been partly attributed to reduced available time due to the time necessary for translation. 16 Strengths and limitations Lyratzopoulos' study analysed data from the national GP Patient Survey and found that South Asian and Chinese patients reported lower ratings of physician communication than White British patients in primary care settings. However, the survey did not gather any data on patients' language use or proficiency. Therefore, this study was able to build on Lyratzopoulos' study, for one remaining question posed by the authors was whether or not English-proficiency influences the association found in their study. 5 Questionnaires were in English, limiting respondents to those who were able to complete a written questionnaire in this language. The result of this exclusion is most likely a bias such that we underestimate the true difference in scores across ethnic and language groups. It is worth noting that while the national GP Patient Survey-on which this questionnaire was based-is available in 13 languages other than English, in 2014/2015 only 0.001% of respondents chose to complete the survey in an alternative language (Ipsos MORI January 2015 Report). Therefore, providing questionnaires in additional languages is unlikely to address these selection bias issues especially given this proportion electing to complete surveys in other languages is far less than the 1.3% of the entire population in England and Wales that reports not speaking English well and 0.3% that does not speak any English, according to the 2011 Census. Additionally, the language in which the consultation was conducted was not known. Therefore, we are unable to identify language-discordant consultations, which other studies have found to be associated with poorer patient ratings of doctor-patient communication. 7 Data protection issues meant sociodemographic data on non-responders were not available, so we were unable to assess the representativeness of our sample. However, by adjusting for age, gender and health status, we should account for major differences. Lastly, there was limited power to disentangle the relative effects of ethnicity, birthplace and language especially due to small sample numbers and collinearity between the three variables. Small samples also reduced the precision of the effect estimates.",

            "text": "Given that effective doctor communication has been associated with improved health outcomes, symptoms control, and patient adherence, this difference in ratings of doctor communication across ethnic and language groups likely parallels differences in health outcomes across these groups. 17 18 Our study shows that language, being a key driver of ethnic differences in patient experience with doctor communication, should be a focus of institutional change to best improve patient experience and outcomes. In order to develop effective measures to improve patient experience of physician communication, one must consider what our definition and measurement of 'language' within surveys, such as these, actually represents. Figure 2 summarises how language might represent a variety of different factors. By identifying these different manifestations of language, we may start to focus better on how to reduce differences in doctor-patient communication ratings across language groups. First, language spoken at home may represent a simple measure of the patient's level of English-proficiency or ability to communicate with the physician. Thus, poor patient satisfaction and experience are likely to be consequences of an inability to effectively articulate one's emotions and symptoms, as well as questions necessary to better understand medical conditions. In response, a possible solution is to increase the multilingual workforce, improve access and availability of interpreting services and refine interpreting techniques. Second, beyond basic language proficiency, language may be a marker of cultural differences in behaviour, including communication, information sharing and evaluation by the patient and the physician. Researchers hypothesise that cultural practices and behaviours can lead to differences in patient satisfaction and experience ratings, 15 19 20 and that physicians have implicit biases and differential attitudes that influence the evaluation and care for patients. 21 Furthermore, studies have found patients report greater satisfaction with languageconcordant consultations due to better ease of communication, greater empathy and higher probability of the physician having a basic understanding of their cultural health beliefs. 7 22 23 These cultural beliefs influence one's interaction with the healthcare system and therefore contribute to differences in experience. For example, some cultural groups show respect by refraining from asking questions, which can result in patients feeling that some of their concerns have not been addressed. 24 Additionally, cultural reporting tendencies affect a patient's evaluation of the healthcare experience. [24][25][26] For example, Chinese patients were found to mark moderate responses more frequently than extreme responses, 26 meaning differences in responses may not reflect actual differences in care. If language is a marker of cultural norms and expectations, patient experience could be improved by hiring minority ethnic physicians who could better understand these behavioural differences. Additionally, redesigning medical education and mid-career training would help to further develop intercultural communication skills and cultural competency to interact appropriately and communicate effectively with other ethnic groups. The term 'cultural competence' was developed recognising differences in patient experience across ethnic groups to define and refine medical practices tailored towards minority ethnic groups. Cultural competence requires career-long selfappraisal to reduce the imbalance of power between the patient and physician and develop and maintain mutually respectful partnerships. The process involves collaboration with patients, communities and colleagues.",

Inevitably, aspects of these would require major systemwide investment and overhaul, and would require sufficient evidence of effectiveness and acceptability. Additionally, all of these potential methods of improving patient experience are based on the assumption that there is thorough understanding of the number, characteristics, language proficiency, preferences, health needs, and expectations of minority ethnic groups and the interplay between these factors. Currently, not all of this information is well known. Further research is needed to study the complex interaction of ethnicity, language, religion and acculturation. As immigration rates continue to rise, it will be increasingly important for countries to actively collect more information on patient characteristics to better understand the range of their patients' cultural backgrounds to be able to deliver more patient-centred care. Only after doing so can we begin to develop effective policies and programmes to reduce these differences in patient experience.",
