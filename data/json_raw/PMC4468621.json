Aim: To investigation severity and distribution of musculoskeletal pain in MS patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 115 members of the Mazandaran MS Association with confirmed MS were randomly selected to participate in the study. The patients were asked to fill out Numerical Rating Score and Nodric questionnaires, respectively. The data was analyzed by SPSS ver. 16 software. Results: The mean age of the participants was 30.43\u00b15.86 years and 88 cases (76.5%) were female. The mean disease duration was 26.34\u00b124.32 months and 87.8% of the cases were experiencing pain at the time of study. The mean pain severity was 3.75\u00b12.25 and worst pain experienced was 5.73\u00b12.12. The most common pain sites were: the knees (55.7%), wrist (43.5%), and neck (41.7%). Women experience higher prevalence of shoulder, upper back, and ankle pain (P<0.05). In 62 cases (53.91%) MS interfered with daily functioning at least for a time. The prevalence of upper back and neck pain was higher in cases with a shorter disease duration (P<0.05). Conclusions: Pain was very common in patients with MS and not relevant to sex or age. In the majority of the cases more than 1 limb was involved and the prevalence of pain in the lower limbs was higher, especially in the knees. In females, the prevalence of pain in the shoulders, upper back, and ankle was higher compared to males. Also, neck and upper-back pain were found in the early stages of the disease.",

According to several other studies the prevalence of pain in MS ranges from 29 to 86 (8). It is reported that the difference between points of prevalence in the studies is due to differences in definitions of pain, type of pain, sample size, survey technique, and tools of data collection (17)(18)(19)(20)(21). According to the literature, pain interferes with MS patients\u00b4 daily functioning and dramatically affects patients\u00b4 quality of life (22,23).",

Pain prevalence is not correlated with sex and age, but there is a significant correlation between pain incidence and disease duration. In most patients, more than one limb are affected with pain simultaneously. Also, the point of prevalence of lower limb pain is higher, especially knee pain. The prevalence of shoulder, upper back and ankle pain was higher in females compared with males. Moreover, the prevalence of upper back pain and neck pain was higher in MS patients with a shorter disease duration.",
