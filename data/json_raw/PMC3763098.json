            "text": "The first major step towards indexing academic journals and helping libraries acquire the most influential sources was made by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) in Philadelphia, USA, in 1960. The idea behind indexing and distributing information on published articles was to facilitate scientific communication between authors and readers (2). In other words, indexing was proposed as a tool for finding relevant sources of interest to the consumers. The originator of the idea, Eugene Garfield, also the founder of the ISI, formulated several critical points in bibliometrics that have shaped citation indexes, for example, libraries with limited funding should be selective about the journals they acquire; most read and highly cited journals constitute 'quality' sources; highly cited articles influence science; citations from highly-cited journals are weighed more than those from low-cited ones; and a bibliography should selectively cover 'high quality' sources.",

Bibliographic databases may also use a specific set of keywords, or thesaurus, to better organise the indexing and to improve the retrievability of the indexed items. Prime examples are Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and EMtree collections of keywords utilised by Medical Literature Analysis and Retrie-val System Online (MEDLINE; US National Library of Medicine) and EMBASE (Elsevier), respectively.

Finally, there are databases requiring subscription and those free to all users. Many leading academic and research institutions worldwide secure paid access to subscription databases. The databases can also be accessed through digital search interfaces such as Ovid and EBSCO, and they can link the indexed items to the full-texts in digital search platforms (for example, Elsevier's ScienceDirect, Springer's SpringerLink, and Wiley Online Library) and free online libraries (for example, PubMed Central and SpringerOpen).",

Periodicals are required to meet certain technical standards to be readable by online software.

The title page of the item is an essential section, where the publication type, title, author names, affiliations, correspondence, copyright details, processing history (submission, revision, acceptance, and online availability dates), citation mode, digital access (DOI), abstract, and author keywords are usually displayed to correctly index the item in an abstracting database. Additional information on research funding needs to be disclosed in the footnotes, particularly for PubMed/MEDLINE. Critically important is the correctness of the references section, which http://dx.doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2013.28.9.1270 is processed by citation-tracking databases.",

Depending on the aims, professional scope, and indexed sources, the selection criteria may differ. Peer review and timeliness of publications are the main criteria which help choose quality periodicals with streamlined publishing. An editorial board with experts who are active in research and publishing and represent most geographic and professional areas of the journal is another critical criterion. It is highly desirable to have profiles of the editors visible in prestigious databases and research platforms. Selection committees of citation indexes (for example, Web of Science) pay special attention to citation profiles of editors and articles in their journals, giving priority to the journals with increasing citations in the target databases. More emphasis is now also placed on editorial credentials, which can be obtained from learned associations such as the European Association of Science Editors (EASE), Council of Science Editors (CSE), and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).",

Some of the old journals have full citation records in this database. For example, over 171,130 articles of the BMJ are indexed from the first issue in 1857, with over 155,900 items being linked to the related full-text articles in PubMed Central. With over 162,700 indexed items, complete PubMed coverage has also been achieved for the top journal Science.
