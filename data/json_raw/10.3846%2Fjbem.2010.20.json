Research included the following four stages: comparative description of the e-cities development in developed countries and in Vilnius, comparison and contrast of e-cities development in developed countries and in Vilnius, development of some of the general recommendations as how to improve the efficiency levels for e-Vilnius, submission of particular recommendations for e-Vilnius. In order to throw more light on the Model, a more detailed description of some above stages follows in the paper."

On that date the European Council of Lisbon decided that the EU should aim at turning by the year 2010 into the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. The aim of eEurope 2005 (Europe's Information \u2026 2005a) is to provide a favourable environment for private investment and for the creation of new jobs, to boost productivity, to modernise public services, and to give everyone the opportunity to participate in the global information society. European Information society in 2010 (\"i2010\") (Europe's Information \u2026 2005b) is an initiative which will provide an integrated approach to information society and audio-visual policies in the EU, covering regulation, research, and deployment and promoting cultural diversity. i2010 objective will be to ensure that Europe's citizens, businesses and governments make the best use of ICTs in order to improve industrial competitiveness, support growth and the creation of jobs and to help address key societal challenges."
