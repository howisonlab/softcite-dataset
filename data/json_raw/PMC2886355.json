How terminal differentiation controls the cell cycle machinery to maintain a stable postmitotic state remains unclear. Evidence from several model organisms suggests that inhibition of the E2F transcription factor and/or the G1-S cyclin, cyclin E (CycE), is a key event for coordinating cell cycle exit and differentiation (for reviews see Miller et al., 2007;Onoyama and Nakayama, 2008;Pajalunga et al., 2008;van den Heuvel and Dyson, 2008). Yet, activation of E2F or CycE in many contexts is insufficient to abrogate exit (Akli et al., 1999;Pajalunga et al., 1999;Latella et al., 2001;Camarda et al., 2004;Balsitis et al., 2006;Gibbs et al., 2008).",

            "text": "E2F transcription factors play key roles in regulating the cell cycle as many genes required for S, G2, and M phases are targets of E2F (Ishida et al., 2001;Polager et al., 2002;Ren et al., 2002;Dimova et al., 2003). Importantly, E2F complexes (made up of an E2F subunit and its dimerization partner [DP]) can act as both transcriptional activators and repressors of the same targets. Association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor proteins (RBs) can convert E2F-DP complexes to transcriptional repressors by recruiting repressive chromatin-modifying complexes (Dyson, 1998), whereas the G1 cyclin-Cdk complexes, CycD-Cdk4 and CycE-Cdk2, promote E2F activity by phosphorylating and inhibiting the association of RBs with E2F-DP complexes (Du and Pogoriler, 2006). CycE-Cdk2 activity is also directly essential for S-phase entry, as it regulates critical components to initiate S phase in both kinase-dependent T erminally differentiated cells in Drosophila melanogaster wings and eyes are largely resistant to proliferation upon deregulation of either E2F or cyclin E (CycE), but exogenous expression of both factors together can bypass cell cycle exit. In this study, we show this is the result of cooperation of cell cycle control mechanisms that limit E2F-CycE positive feedback and prevent cycling after terminal differentiation. Aberrant CycE activity after differentiation leads to the degradation of E2F activator complexes, which increases the proportion of CycE-resistant E2F repressor complexes, resulting in stable E2F target gene repression. If E2F-dependent repression is lost after differentiation, high anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activity degrades key E2F targets to limit cell cycle reentry. Providing both CycE and E2F activities bypasses exit by simultaneously inhibiting the APC/C and inducing a group of E2F target genes essential for cell cycle reentry after differentiation. These mechanisms are essential for proper development, as evading them leads to tissue outgrowths composed of dividing but terminally differentiated cells.",

E2F transcriptional activity was monitored in wings at stages after cell cycle exit, using a reporter containing an E2F-responsive proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) promoter fused to GFP (Thacker et al., 2003). In the absence of e2f2, CycE-Cdk2 was able to activate the E2F reporter in clones within the wing after terminal differentiation at 36 h after puparium formation (APF; Fig. 1 A), an effect absent in wild-type (WT) wings. However, the CycE-Cdk2-induced E2F activity in e2f2 mutant wings was temporary, as CycE-Cdk2 was unable to sustain E2F activity beyond 40 h APF in the absence of e2f2 (Fig. 1 B).",

GFP-marked e2f2-null mutant clones expressing CycE-Cdk2 were generated using the mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) system (Lee and Luo, 2001) and examined for ectopic mitoses after normal cell cycle exit in pupal eyes and wings by staining for phosphorylated Ser10 on histone H3 (PH3; Fig. 1, C-E). Ectopic mitoses were evident in e2f2 \ue032/\ue032 cells expressing CycE-Cdk2 in eyes from 24-44 h APF ( Fig. 1 C, 36 h APF shown), indicating a delay of cell cycle exit 8 h beyond the effect of CycE-Cdk2 expression alone in the eye. However, mitoses were no longer observed in e2f2 \ue032/\ue032 cells expressing CycE-Cdk2 after 44 h APF in eyes ( Fig. 1 D) or in wings after 36 h APF ( Fig. 1 E and  Table I). This reveals a cell cycle exit function for e2f2 in temporarily limiting CycE activation of E2F but also demonstrates that an e2f2-independent mechanism prevents E2F transcriptional activation after prolonged exit in eyes and wings.",

E2F1 is degraded each cell cycle during S phase in a PCNA interaction protein motif (PIP) box-dependent manner via a Cul4 ubiquitin ligase complex (Shibutani et al., 2007;2008). We considered whether ectopic CycE-Cdk2 activity could inhibit E2F activity after exit by promoting S-phase initiation and thereby E2F1 degradation. This idea was supported by our previous observation that CycE-Cdk2 expression correlated with low E2F1 protein levels in the wing . and -independent manners (Lukas et al., 1997;Mailand and Diffley, 2005;Geng et al., 2007).",

High CycE-Cdk2 activity normally promotes increased E2F activity via phosphorylation of RBs and cooperates with E2Fdependent induction of CycE and Cdk2 to establish a positive E2F-CycE feedback loop for cell cycle entry (Yung et al., 2007;Assoian and Yung, 2008), similar to that of Cln1 and -2 in yeast (Skotheim et al., 2008). However, we have found that E2F-CycE positive feedback appears to be limited after terminal differentiation to prevent ectopic cycling . In this study, we examine why both ectopic E2F and CycE activities must be provided to bypass cell cycle exit in Drosophila and uncover specific cell cycle control mechanisms that cooperate to limit E2F-CycE positive feedback and maintain a stable postmitotic state.",

            "text": "CycE induces E2F activity in proliferating and reversibly quiescent cells by preventing the formation of Rbf-E2F repressive complexes. However, our previous results indicated that CycE activity could not prevent repression of E2F target genes after cell cycle exit in terminally differentiated eye and wing cells . Rbf-E2F2-mediated repression is somehow resistant to G1 cyclin-Cdks despite G1 cyclin-Cdk phosphorylation of Rbf (Frolov et al., 2003). This makes E2F2 complexes prime candidates as factors limiting CycE-dependent activation of E2F after cell cycle exit in differentiated cells. Genetic studies of E2F2 have failed to demonstrate a role for E2F2 in cell cycle exit upon differentiation in vivo (Frolov et al., 2001;Weng et al., 2003). e2f2 mutant cells exit from the wing and eye. Levels of GFP-E2F1 were determined by detection of the GFP tag using an anti-GFP antibody and compared between GFP-E2F1 WT and GFP-E2F1 PIP3A (Fig. 1, F-H). We found that levels of GFP-E2F1 PIP3A in the presence of CycE-Cdk2 after To test whether CycE-Cdk2 activity affected degradation of E2F1 after cell cycle exit in a PIP box-dependent manner, we generated clones coexpressing either WT GFP-E2F1 WT or E2F with a mutated PIP box, GFP-E2F1 PIP3A with CycE-Cdk2 in the Figure 1. Degradation of E2F1 activator complexes and a switch to E2F2 repressor complexes contributes to the CycE-Cdk2-resistant repression of E2F activity after exit. Clones overexpressing CycE-Cdk2 and negatively marked by CD2 (A and B) were generated using hs-FLP act>Gal4/UAS in e2f2 76Q1/G5.1 mutant wings. E2F transcriptional activity was monitored at the indicated stages using the PCNA-GFP reporter (A\ue039 and B\ue039). CycE-Cdk2 activity is temporarily able to activate the E2F reporter in the absence of e2f2 (A) but is unable to sustain E2F activity after 40 h APF (B). (C-E) GFP-marked e2f2-null mutant clones expressing CycE-Cdk2 were generated using the MARCM system and examined for ectopic mitoses by staining for PH3. Neurons are marked by expression of Elav. Ectopic mitoses in e2f2 \ue032/\ue032 cells expressing CycE-Cdk2 are evident in Elav-negative cells in eyes from 24 to 40 h APF (36 h APF shown; C) but are no longer observed by 44 h APF (D). No ectopic mitoses are observed in e2f2 \ue032/\ue032 cells expressing CycE-Cdk2 in wings after 36 h APF (E). (F-H) Clones expressing either GFP-E2F1 WT or GFP-E2F1 PIP3A with CycE-Cdk2 were generated using hs-FLP act>Gal4/UAS in pupal wings (F-H) and eyes (H). Clones were negatively marked by CD2 (F and G), and levels of GFP-tagged E2F1 were compared at 44 h APF. All GFP measurements were acquired at the same gain and at roughly similar tissue sections. Several samples (n = 7) across three independent experiments were compared for GFP intensity using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), and representative examples are shown. Bars in H indicate the mean GFP intensity across all samples measured, and error bars indicate the standard deviation. GFP-E2F1 WT is destabilized in the presence of CycE-Cdk2 after exit in eyes and wings (F-H). Wings expressing either GFP-E2F1 WT or GFP-E2F1 PIP3A in the dorsal domain during pupal stages (under control of ap-Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS ) were assayed for PH3. (I and J) No ectopic mitoses were evident in wings expressing either the stabilized or WT forms of E2F1 after 36 h APF (44 h APF shown).

Expression of the G2-M regulators, CycA, Rca1 (regulator of CycA), and the Cdc25c phosphatase, String (Stg), all failed to bypass exit in Dp-null cells (Fig. S1). However, some Dp \ue032/\ue032 cells coexpressing CycE and the G2-M regulator Stg continued cycling at 40-44 h APF, as indicated by PH3 and MPM2, with a mitotic index of 0.9% and 3% in the wing and eye, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D, PH3 shown). Importantly, rare ectopic mitoses were also evident in some control WT wings and eyes expressing CycE and Stg (mitotic index up to 0.3% and 1.0% in some wing and eyes, respectively; Fig. 2, G and H). This suggests that some very low level of cycling, undetected by our previous clonal assays , continues in a small number of cells expressing CycE + Stg. This cycling is moderately increased threefold when all E2F-DP function is lost in Dp-null cells. Therefore, we questioned whether the loss of E2F2-DP repressive function was responsible for the increased cycling exit were higher in both pupal eyes and wings than GFP-E2F1 WT  (Fig. 1, F-H). This suggests that if CycE-Cdk2 is aberrantly activated after exit, it could induce S-phase initiation and PIP box-dependent E2F1 degradation to serve as a selfcorrecting mechanism to limit CycE-E2F positive feedback after exit.",

The failure of most Dp mutant cells to significantly bypass cell cycle exit, even in the presence of high CycE and Stg, suggests that E2F-DP activity is somehow required for ectopic proliferation of terminally differentiated cells, even though it is not required for proliferation earlier in development (Frolov et al., 2001(Frolov et al., , 2005. .

Proliferation of differentiated cells in the late wing generated that expressing CycE and Stg in rbf \ue032/\ue032 cells might completely bypass exit by providing the necessary G2-M activity and E2F activator function. To test this, we generated GFP-marked rbfnull mutant clones expressing CycE and Stg using the MARCM system and examined them for ectopic S phases (by BrdU incorporation) or mitoses (PH3). Ectopic cell cycles, including S phases and mitoses, were evident at very high levels (mitotic Figure 3.

            "text": "Our results with rbf \ue032/\ue032 cells indicate that some level of E2F activator, not simply E2F derepression, is required to bypass cell cycle exit upon terminal differentiation. This requirement is specific to the forced proliferation of terminally differentiating cells, as cells lacking all E2F-DP activity can proliferate during normal development (Frolov et al., 2001(Frolov et al., , 2003(Frolov et al., , 2005. This suggests that certain critical E2F targets may require the activator function of E2F for expression in differentiating cells. Therefore, we chose to compare gene expression changes caused by high E2F activity to those caused by the loss of all E2F-DP function in terminally differentiating cells. . E2F transcriptional activation and Dp loss are highly similar, except for specific genes that require E2F activity for expression after exit. Using microarrays, we compared gene expression in E2F1-DP-expressing wings (ap-Gal4/UAS-E2F1, UAS-DP, tub-Gal80 TS ) with controls (ap-Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS ) and Dp mutant wings (w;Dp a1/a2 ) with controls (w) at three time points. (A) Heat map of transcript changes (color range indicates the log 2 ratio of expression compared with controls). All transcripts with a fold change of 1.5 or more (>log 2 \u00b1 0.6) at one or more time points are shown. Gray bars indicate transcripts that were removed from analysis because of high variability among independently replicated experiments (n = 4 for E2F; n = 3 for Dp \ue032/\ue032 ). Transcripts were clustered using Genesis software for hierarchical clustering. Representative genes from each major cluster are listed on the right. Typical group transcripts are up-regulated in E2F-expressing and Dp \ue032/\ue032 wings at 24 and 36 h APF, whereas other transcripts are repressed or inversely regulated. Arrays for E2F and Dp \ue032/\ue032 at 24 and 36 h were highly similar with a correlation coefficient of 0.74. (B) A group of 162 genes was up-regulated >1.75-fold (>log 2 0.82) by E2F activity at one or both time points APF but was not significantly increased in Dp \ue032/\ue032 (change <1.3-fold; <log 2 0.4).

(B-I) GFP-marked clones expressing the indicated cell cycle regulators were generated using hs-FLP tub>Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS and examined for PH3 (B-I) or MPM2 (F). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue; G-I). PH3 is seen in clones expressing the APC/C inhibitor Rca1 at 24-36 h APF in the eye and wing (wing shown; B) but not the late wing and was only observed once in the eye at 40-44 h APF (C, arrow). When E2F1-DP and Rca1 are coexpressed, bypass of exit is observed as late as 60 h APF (D) without disrupting terminal differentiation of ommatidia or bristles (E). Yellow outline indicates clone boundary. Coexpression of E2F1-DP with Fzy RNAi or Fzr RNAi also led to ectopic mitoses in eyes (F and H) and wings (G and I) at 48 h APF, as shown by PH3 Mechanisms maintaining cell cycle exit \u2022 Buttitta et al.",

When arrays were compared, a correlation coefficient of 0.74 was found for E2F and Dp \ue032/\ue032 arrays at 24 and 36 h APF. Representative genes from each major cluster are listed in Fig. 4. The largest cluster consists of what we call typical transcripts, which represent many known E2F target genes, that are up-regulated in both E2F-expressing and Dp \ue032/\ue032 wings at 24 and 36 h APF. This group contains most of the 157 genes identified as Drosophila E2F targets in proliferating S2 cells by Dimova et al. (2003). This even includes genes in groups B and C from that study, which were unaffected by Dp loss in S2 cells (Dimova et al., 2003) but we find to be affected by Dp loss in wings in vivo. We also identified many additional E2F targets corroborated by other model system studies (for review see Bracken et al., 2004). Typical group transcripts were enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms involved in cell cycle (P < 6.84 \ue0329 ), DNA replication and repair (P < 2.56 \ue0328 ), microtubule cytoskeleton organization (P < 2.14 \ue0327 ), and DNA packaging (P < 2.84 \ue0324 ).",

Because E2F1-DP is thought to act as a transcriptional activator, this group of repressed genes is somewhat unexpected. These genes are not repressed indirectly by a delay in cell cycle exit, as they are similarly repressed in Dp mutants, which exit normally.

Relatively little attention, though, has focused on the mechanisms that ultimately act to establish in dacapo-null mutant cells overexpressing E2F1-DP . In our array analysis, we noted that E2F activity (or Dp loss) induced expression of several components of the APC/C and certain APC/C activators (Fig. 5 A).

We have confirmed that both Fzr transcript and protein also increase in wings after normal exit (Fig. S2 C). We speculated that an increase in APC/C activity after exit could limit E2F-induced bypass of exit by degrading the G2-M cyclin-Cdks and Stg, which are known APC/C targets. This could also raise the threshold for CycE after exit by requiring increased CycE-Cdk2 activity to inhibit the high levels of APC/C (Sigrist et al., 1995;Sigrist and Lehner, 1997;Reber et al., 2006). This idea is consistent with the finding that the loss of fzr or shattered delays cell cycle exit by one cycle in the embryo and larval eye (Sigrist and Lehner, 1997;Pimentel and Venkatesh, 2005;Tanaka-Matakatsu et al., 2007).

APC/C activity is dependent on sufficient levels of core components and the presence of the activators Cdc20 (Fzy in Drosophila) and Fzr. To directly reduce APC/C activity in cells overexpressing E2F, we coexpressed E2F with RNAis to core APC/C components (APC2 and -8) or the activators Fzy or Fzr in clones and examined late pupal eyes and wings after 48 h APF for ectopic cycling. We observed frequent mitoses, as assessed by both PH3 and MPM2 cytoplasmic staining in pupal eyes and wings at 56 h APF, when E2F was coexpressed with each RNAi (Fig. 5, F-I; and Fig. S2, E and F).

            "text": "Previous studies in Drosophila have suggested that cell cycle exit is normally triggered by a decrease in CycE-Cdk2 activity, through the cooperation of multiple CycE inhibitors such as Dacapo, the Figure 6. APC/C activity limits accumulation of E2F-induced cell cycle regulators. GFP-marked clones expressing the indicated cell cycle regulators were generated using hs-FLP tub>Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS and examined for CycA, CycB, or Gem (A, B, and E-J). Clones negatively marked by CD2, expressing the indicated regulators (C and D) were generated using hs-FLP act>Gal4/UAS and examined for Stg-GFP fusion protein. Cells expressing E2F1-DP in the wing and eye fail to accumulate CycA (A), Stg-GFP (C), Gem (E), and CycB (G) at 40-48 h APF. Cells coexpressing E2F1-DP + Rca1 accumulate CycA (B) and low levels of CycB in the wing (F), as well as Stg-GFP and Gem in the eye (D and H). Cells expressing CycE-Cdk2 accumulate Gem in the eye (I) and effect on the cell cycle after terminal differentiation? During proliferative stages, overexpression of CycE-Cdk2 does not arrest cells, and E2F1 is able to reaccumulate after S phase. In contrast, cells with high CycE-Cdk2 after differentiation fail to complete their final G1-S transition or arrest in S phase with low E2F1 protein levels , suggesting that the E2F1 degradation machinery remains active. This arrest may be partially caused by the depletion of E2F target genes critical for S-phase completion. But the arrest of rbf \ue032/\ue032 cells overexpressing CycE in the wing blade, which have high levels of E2F target gene expression from previous cell cycles, suggests that there may also be an activation of a checkpoint or inhibition of a key activity for S-phase completion independent of E2F transcriptional regulation after terminal differentiation. Although we do not know the specific mechanism for this arrest, the addition of Stg is able to restore cycling in rbf \ue032/\ue032 cells overexpressing CycE (Fig. 3 and Table I). This demonstrates that Stg or a target of Cdk1 activity is able to bypass the arrest of cells with high CycE-Cdk2 after terminal differentiation to allow E2F1 reaccumulation.",

            "text": "The data presented in this study demonstrate an important role for the APC/C in maintaining cell cycle exit in the face of aberrant E2F activity in terminally differentiated postmitotic tissues (Fig. 5). Interestingly, work in mammalian neurons has shown additional postmitotic functions for the APC/C in mature cells (Puram et al., 2010). Both the APC/C Fzr/Cdh1 and APC/C Cdc20 complexes carry out important nonmitotic functions in the control of axon and dendrite growth and patterning, synapse development, and neuron survival (Konishi et al., 2004;Li et al., 2008;Huynh et al., 2009;Kim et al., 2009;Yang et al., 2009). This suggests that the APC/C complexes in many terminally differentiated cells carry out previously unappreciated dual roles in promoting postmitotic cell maturation and protecting against aberrant cell cycle reentry. This is supported by the recent finding that Cdh1 is a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor in mice (Garc\u00eda-Higuera et al., 2008), although further studies will be required to determine whether the tumors in Cdh1 APC/C Fzr activity normally increases at G1 arrest, degrading G2 and mitotic cell cycle targets such as CycA, CycB, and Stg ( Fig. S2; Sigrist and Lehner, 1997;Pimentel and Venkatesh, 2005;Tanaka-Matakatsu et al., 2007;Zielke, 2007). This function of the APC/C is essential for timely exit, as loss of the APC/C is sufficient to cause an additional cell cycle, likely via unrestrained CycA activity (Table I;  Sigrist and Lehner, 1997;Jacobs et al., 2001;Tanaka-Matakatsu et al., 2007). The mammalian APC/C Fzr/Cdh1 has been shown to interact with RB to promote cell cycle exit via degradation of Skp2 and subsequent stabilization of p27 Kip1 (Binn\u00e9 et al., 2007). A similar mechanism may also act to promote exit in Drosophila via APC/C Fzr , Rbf, and Dacapo, but functions for a Drosophila Skp2 homologue in cell cycle control have not yet been examined.",

CycE-Cdk2 activity has been shown to inhibit APC/C (Sigrist and Lehner, 1997;Reber et al., 2006), and thus, the increased APC/C activity present in differentiating cells may raise the threshold levels of CycE required for APC/C suppression. Our data suggest that this may explain, at least in part, why supraphysiological levels of ectopic CycE are required to bypass cell cycle exit in differentiating wings and eyes (Fig. 7).",

In such cells, the S phase-dependent degradation of E2F1 protein by the Cul4 ubiquitin E3 ligase appears to remain on, leading to an increased ratio of repressive E2F2 to E2F1. This ultimately results in stable CycE-Cdk2-resistant repression of E2F target genes and cell cycle exit (Fig. 1). If E2F2 is absent, aberrant CycE-Cdk2 leads to S-phase initiation and PIP boxdependent Cul4-mediated destruction of E2F1, resulting in loss of both E2Fs and thereby loss of all E2F-DP function. This situation is similar to that in Dp mutants, which lack all E2F-dependent transcriptional function. In these mutants, critical cell cycle genes, including Stg and other cyclin-Cdk regulators, are protected from derepression (Fig. 4 B), and their expression remains low, ensuring a noncycling state.",

In some cases, this serves a beneficial regenerative function, as recently shown for terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes in the zebrafish heart (Jopling et al., 2010;Kikuchi et al., 2010). But in other cases, this ability seems to be a part of the normal tissue development, as shown for differentiated horizontal cells that reenter the cell cycle for their final division in the zebrafish retina before full maturation (Godinho et al., 2007). Proliferation of terminally differentiated mammalian cells has also been observed in monocytes and macrophages lacking the c-Maf and MafB transcription factors (Aziz et al., 2009). Strikingly, Maf double knockout macrophages appear to fully retain their differentiation-associated functions in vivo despite exhibiting continued cycling for months, demonstrating a clear independence of differentiation and cell cycle exit in these cells (Aziz et al., 2009).",

Evasion of the robust cell cycle exit mechanism by loss of the tumor suppressor rbf together with deregulation of CycE and Stg can lead to tumor-like overproliferation of differentiated tissues (Fig. 3). Our results may be relevant to specific cancers such as retinoblastoma, where aberrantly dividing differentiated cells have been proposed to be the cancer cell of origin (Chen et al., 2004;Ajioka et al., 2007;Xu et al., 2009). Aberrant division of differentiated cells could lead to genetic instability and acquisition of secondary mutations, leading to dedifferentiation and ultimately to metastatic cancer. Our data show that the robust exit mechanism is essential for proper tissue development and suggest that even terminally differentiated cells should not be excluded as a potential source of cancer.",

In addition to the analysis provided in the results section, we also examined the other clusters of transcripts affected by E2F activity in the wing. The second largest cluster of coregulated genes in E2F-overexpressing and Dp mutant wings was repressed in differentiating cells. Because E2F1-DP is thought to act as a transcriptional activator, this group of repressed genes is somewhat unexpected. These genes are not repressed indirectly by a delay in cell cycle exit, as they are similarly repressed in Dp mutants, which exit normally. We also do not believe that this group is caused by E2F1-DP repressive complexes blocking transcription, as such targets would be expected to increase rather than decrease in Dp mutants. One possibility suggested by Bracken et al. (2004) is that the extensive transcriptional up-regulation caused by E2F (or in Dp mutants) could cause some spurious antisense regulation of genes. Although we have not investigated this possibility, >0% of the transcriptional changes we observed in both genotypes are indeed increases in transcript levels. Overall, this group of repressed transcripts is significantly enriched for genes involved in monooxygenase activity (caused by six cytochromeP450 genes; P < 8.08 \ue0324 ) and genes with catalytic activity (P < 5.85 \ue0324 ), suggesting some functional significance for this group.",

            "text": "We were surprised to find that most transcripts were not affected by E2F overexpression or Dp loss at the proliferative L3 time point. This may be because E2F target gene expression is already high in controls during proliferation, as evident by the high activity of the E2F reporter construct (PCNA-GFP) and high levels of E2F target gene expression at this stage (Thacker et al., 2003). This is also supported by our finding that the few transcripts up-regulated by E2F and/or Dp loss at L3 are normally at low abundance in wings and were significantly (P < 0.009) enriched for genes with expression one standard deviation lower than the mean gene expression. These transcripts were also enriched for genes identified as group D or E germline/ differentiation genes specifically regulated by E2F2 in Dimova et al. (2003), which we find to be ectopically induced in nongermline tissues by E2F overexpression and Dp loss (examples include spn-E, nanos, BthD, CG6790, CG8316, and CG7628). Thus, the transcriptional activation of E2F targets at proliferative stages seems to be masked by the high levels of E2F activity already present in the controls. Interestingly, this also suggests that normal levels of E2F targets are somehow maintained in an E2F-DP-independent manner in proliferating Dp mutant cells.",
