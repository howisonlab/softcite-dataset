In our experimental games, players negotiate over the division of a surplus by claiming valuable objects that have payoff-irrelevant spatial locations. Negotiation occurs in continuous time, constrained by a deadline. In some games, spatial cues are opposed to principles of equality or efficiency. We find a strong tendency for players to agree on efficient and minimally unequal payoff divisions, even if spatial cues suggest otherwise. But if there are two such divisions, cues are often used to select between them, inducing distributional effects. (JEL C78, D63, D83)",

            "text": "In The Strategy of Conflict, Thomas C. Schelling (1960, pp. 53, 67-74) proposes the hypothesis that the outcomes of bargaining problems can be systematically influenced by \"incidental details\" or (as they would now be called) properties of framing or labeling. These labeling properties or cues have no direct relationship to payoffs and are not represented in standard game-theoretic models, but they nevertheless provide a means by which players can coordinate their expectations. Although much of his theoretical analysis and all of his informal experiments are concerned with simultaneous-move games without communication, Schelling claims that this hypothesis applies to \"explicit bargaining with full communication and enforcement.\" He acknowledges that communication provides mechanisms for coordination that are not present in his simple experiments, but still argues that framing properties can remain significant in explicit bargaining. Most subsequent bargaining theory has not used this idea. But if real-world bargaining is substantially affected by payoff-irrelevant cues, a satisfactory theory of bargaining needs to take account of that fact. Our paper reports experimental tests of Schelling's hypothesis in a range of different bargaining games.",

For games in which the players have a common interest in coordinating but have conflicting preferences between equilibria, the evidence is more mixed. Investigating matching games (that is, games in which each player sees the same set of labels and chooses one of them, with the aim of making the same choice as her coplayer(s)), Crawford, Gneezy, and Rottenstreich (2008) find a strong tendency for coordination on salient labels if the players' interests are fully aligned, but that these effects sometimes disappear when that alignment is less than perfect. In contrast, when mixed-motive games are framed as problems of tacit bargaining over the division of a stock of value, payoff-irrelevant cues have been found to have strong effects (Isoni et al. 2013). But it is still an open question whether conclusions about the role of payoff-irrelevant cues in tacit bargaining extend to explicit bargaining.",

By contrast, when bargainers can communicate with one another and make offers and counteroffers, additional mechanisms for the coordination of expectations are available, and payoff-based principles such as efficiency and equality might have more influence. Joseph Farrell's (1987) analysis of cheap talk shows that, for games with a Battle of the Sexes structure, preplay communication can facilitate agreement on one of the two pure-strategy equilibria; the symmetry between the two players is broken by their probabilistic choice of messages in the symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium, rather than by asymmetric cues. 2 These considerations might seem to support the intuition that payoff-irrelevant cues lose their power when bargaining is explicit.",

This argument applies to bargaining that takes place over a finite interval of time, ending at a fixed deadline or \"midnight bell.\" Because of the deadline, a \"perfectly move-symmetrical bargaining game\" must have a final round of simultaneous play. Thus, a game with communication \"necessarily gives way, at some definite penultimate moment, to a tacit (noncooperative) bargaining game.\" Schelling then argues: \"Each player must be assumed to know this and may, if he wishes, by simply avoiding overt agreement, elect to play the tacit game instead\" (1960, pp. 267-272, italics in original). If it is common knowledge that the tacit game, if reached, will be resolved in a particular way, then neither player will agree to an inferior payoff in the preceding negotiation. So if it is common knowledge that tacit bargaining problems are resolved by the use of payoff-irrelevant cues, explicit communication may be redundant.",

A payoff-irrelevant feature provides no additional information about the payoffs that are associated with given strategy profiles. However, it may influence players' strategy choices (and hence the actual payoffs they derive from playing the game). In a game with two or more equilibria, a payoff-irrelevant feature may make one equilibrium particularly salient, thus suggesting a solution to the problem of equilibrium selection. A commonly recognized solution to such a problem (whether suggested by payoff-irrelevant or payoff-based features of the game) is a focal point.",

In particular, since subjects might have preferences for equality in experimental earnings (as proposed by Schmidt 1999 andOckenfels 2000), those cues should not provide information about the distribution of material payoffs between subjects for given strategy profiles-even if that information is irrelevant from the perspective of axiomatic bargaining theory under the assumption of self-interest. Thus, the design developed by Roth and Malouf (1979) and by Roth and Murnighan (1982), which investigates the effects on the outcomes of explicit bargaining games of varying information about the distribution of material payoffs, would not be suitable for our purposes. Nor should the cues to be investigated provide information about the players which might suggest differences in their moral entitlements to rewards. Thus, it would not be appropriate for us to use a design such as that of G\u00e4chter and Riedl (2005), which tests whether bargaining outcomes are influenced by players' perceptions of \"moral property rights,\" induced by relative performance in a general knowledge quiz. We need an experimental environment in which the cues that discriminate between alternative bargaining outcomes are perceived by the players only as a device for selecting between equilibria, and not as a source of information about the subjective values of those equilibria. Our experiment is designed so that the relevant cues meet this requirement.",

We wanted a bargaining protocol which had the \"feel\" of a bargaining problem to the subjects who engaged in it. We wanted to allow bargainers to communicate with one another simply and freely, up to a fixed deadline, and to be able to make binding agreements during this period. We wanted to be able to introduce cues that were clearly payoff-irrelevant and yet would be perceived as a natural part of the bargaining problem, rather than merely as extraneous labels. And we wanted to use cues that were known to work as focal points in tacit bargaining and pure coordination games, so that if we were to find that those cues were ineffective in our explicit bargaining games, that finding could not be attributed to the cues being insufficiently salient. Figure 1 shows the displays used in the 30 bargaining games that featured in our main treatment, labeled G1 to G30. Each game used a bargaining table format, similar to that used by Isoni et al. (2013) to investigate tacit bargaining. Each bargaining table was a 9 \u00d7 9 grid on which were superimposed two colored squares, representing the players' respective \"bases,\" and a number of \"discs.\" On each disc there was a number, denoting its money value (in UK pounds). The players communicated anonymously with one another through computer terminals. Each player's screen showed the bargaining table, rotated so that her own base appeared at the bottom. On the screen, players were labeled as \"you\" (with a red base) and \"other\" (with a gray base) so that there was no commonly known asymmetry between their descriptions. (For purposes of exposition, we will refer to the player whose base is on the left in Figure 1 as L, and the player on the right as R.) The players were invited to negotiate an agreement on how to divide the discs between them. The full text of the instructions is reproduced in the online Appendix. 3 Negotiation took place continuously in real time, for a maximum of 90 seconds. At any time in this 90-second interval, either player could \"claim\" any disc by clicking on it with her mouse; any claim could be canceled at any time by a further click. Each player could claim as many discs as she wished. Discs could be claimed again",

On each player's screen, the discs she claimed turned red and were connected to her base by a red line; the discs claimed by the other player turned gray and were connected to the other person's base by a gray line. When a disc was claimed by both players, it turned yellow and started to blink, while still connected to both bases by colored lines. At any time, either player could report that she was willing to agree to the claims she and her coplayer currently made. This was done by ticking an \"accept box.\" Throughout the negotiation time, each player could see both her own box and her coplayer's. An \"accept\" tick could be canceled at any time prior to an actual agreement, and was automatically canceled if either player changed her claims. An agreement was sealed if and when there was a tick in each player's accept box. At this stage, if any disc was claimed by both players, each player's payoff from the game was zero; otherwise, each player's payoff was the total value of the discs she had claimed. If no agreement had been reached after 90 seconds, players' payoffs were calculated as if they had agreed to the set of claims that was current when the time allowed for bargaining expired. This design feature allows coplayers to maintain conflicting claims right up to the final seconds of the game, while keeping open the possibility of achieving positive payoffs through a very late change of claims by one player. Such a concession would typically require only a few mouse clicks. Notice also that this bargaining protocol allows players to agree to leave some discs unclaimed by either of them, or to agree that both payoffs be zero. 4 (A screenshot of the bargaining table is shown in the online Appendix.)",

Because these \"messages\" are sent by mouse clicks and are immediately displayed on players' screens in an intuitive way, they can be exchanged very quickly. A more important difference is that, in our protocol, players make claims on specific objects rather than proposing distributions of the total available payoff. One consequence of this feature is that a given profile of payoffs may be consistent with more than one set of claims, and so may set a coordination problem for two players who both want to arrive at those payoffs. 6 (In G1, for example, there are two distinct sets of claims which imply that each player receives \u00a35.) However, given the communication opportunities provided by our protocol, one might expect such coordination problems to be easily solved. For our purposes, the principal advantage of linking claims with objects is that it allows us to use the spatial layout of discs as an intuitively natural cue.",

We recognize that the layout of discs on the table could prompt mental associations with real-world situations in which there are transport costs that increase with distance, or in which taking closer rather than more distant objects is an apparently natural heuristic. But mental associations such as these are exactly what Schelling's theory is about. Discussing the role of focal points in bargaining, Schelling says that what is perceived as the \"obvious\" outcome depends \"on what analogies or precedents the definition of the bargaining issue calls to mind,\" and that the mechanism that lies behind focality is \"the power of suggestion\" (1960, pp. 69, 73, italics in original). From experiments on matching games, it is known that the labels which are focal are often those that are perceived as \"favorites\"-in other words, that prompt mental associations with subjective value (Bardsley et al. 2010). In the classic matching game of choosing a meeting place in New York City, the focality of Grand Central Station for Schelling's respondents surely has something to do with associations of ideas with travel costs; in the 1950s, for residents of New Haven, CT traveling to New York City by train, Grand Central Station was presumably a cost-minimizing meeting place. It seems unavoidable that, in any fair test of Schelling's theory, payoff-irrelevant cues will have associations with real-world concepts of value, or with real-world precedents or habits. What is required (and our design achieves) is that the experiment uses labels that are payoff-irrelevant: that is, they do not provide information about the actual payoffs of the game that subjects play, and that this fact is transparent.",

In any game in which there is at least one disc at each player's side of the table, we will say that the spatial cues pick out the solution in which each player takes the discs at her side of the table, and no others. Games in which all the discs are in the central column (spatially neutral games) will be used as controls. 7 In G4, for example, the spatial cues pick out the solution in which player L takes the \u00a36 disc and player R takes the \u00a35 disc. Notice that spatial cues may pick out solutions in which some discs are assigned to neither player. For example, the spatial cues of G21 pick out the solution in which each player takes the \u00a35 disc on her own side of the table, leaving the \u00a31 disc in the central column unclaimed. The idea that cues can work in this way is consistent with Schelling's (1960, pp. 295-297) discussion of games in which payoff-dominated equilibria are focal. It should also be remembered that if players have preferences for equality in money earnings, a solution that achieves equality by leaving some discs unclaimed can be non-dominated in utility.",

For example, G1 and G2 are both defined by D = {5, 5}. 8 The specification of D determines which combinations of payoffs are feasible. We define an allocation ( w L , w R ) as a pair of payoffs to L and R respectively. Notice that an allocation is defined in terms of payoffs; when we need to refer to players' final claims on the discs themselves, defined by their spatial locations, we will use the term assignment. An allocation is feasible if it would result from some assignment of discs to players that is consistent with the rules of the game. (Thus, if D = {5, 5}, the set of feasible allocations is {(0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 10), (5, 0), (5, 5), (10, 0)}.) Now consider any feasible allocation ( w L , w R ) in a game in which the total value of the discs is v. The efficiency of this allocation is ( w L + w R )/v; we will say the allocation is efficient if ( w L + w R )/v = 1, and inefficient otherwise. The allocation is equal if w L = w R . Its worse consequence is min( w L , w R ). It is least-unequal efficient (LUE) if it is efficient and if no efficient allocation has a strictly greater worse consequence. It is least-inefficient equal (LIE) if it is equal and if no equal allocation gives greater payoffs to both players. It is equal and efficient (EE) if it is both LUE and LIE. Intuition suggests that, in the absence of payoff-irrelevant cues, LUE and LIE allocations are particularly likely to be perceived as focal.

One constraint is that, for any payoffs x and y, (x, y) is feasible if and only if (y, x) is feasible; the payoff opportunities available to the players are always symmetrical. A second constraint is that if the LIE allocation is inefficient, it must be weakly dominated by each of the LUE allocations. For example, consider a game with v = 11 in which (4, 4) is LIE. Then there must be one or more discs worth three in total that are \"left on the table\" if (4, 4) is reached, which implies that (7, 4) and (4, 7) are also feasible. A third constraint is that if (x, y) and (y, x) are LUE with x > 2y, there must be a disc worth exactly x which is left on the table in any equal allocation, and so the LIE payoff to each player cannot be greater than y/2 (with the implication that the LIE allocation is strictly dominated by the LUE allocations). 9 Subject to these constraints, we investigate the effects of spatial cues in relation to a range of different efficiency/equality trade-offs.

A simple model of this kind, based on the asymmetric Hawk-Dove game (Smith and Parker 1976;Sugden 2005), is presented in the online Appendix. The essential idea behind the model is that players may be spatially aware or spatially blind. Spatially blind players follow strategies that are independent of cues. Such players are of two types-tough bargainers (\"hawks\") and soft bargainers (\"doves\"). Spatially aware players act as hawks when they are favored and as doves when they are not. Whatever the mix of these three types, provided that there are at least some spatially aware players, average payoffs are strictly higher for favored than for unfavored players.

This was known to the subject, but the matching sequence was varied so that subjects did not know which member of their group was their coplayer in any given game. Given the number of games to be played, it was infeasible to match subjects in a way that would allow each pair in any given game to be treated as an independent observation. Thus, to allow clean statistical tests with an acceptable degree of power, it was necessary to match subjects within small fixed groups and to use matching groups as the units of observation. Partner matching (i.e., a group size of two) would have introduced the possibility that pairs might try to equalize average payoffs over the 18 games, for example by alternating which player would get the larger share of the surplus. We judged that, with a group size of four and with no opportunities for free-form communication, group-level cooperation across games would be difficult to sustain. However, it is possible that the use of matching groups could have induced subjects to bargain less aggressively than they would have done in one-shot games.",

Two of these games (G4 and G6) appeared in both Set I and Set II. In each of these ten cases, the level of average efficiency and the proportion of pairs who settled on LUE allocations were similar to the values observed in the corresponding spatially neutral game. In each case, there is no significant difference in average group earnings between the spatially neutral game and the game in which spatial cues pick out one of the unequal LUE allocations. 16 For the reasons explained in Section II, the similarity in efficiency need not be interpreted as evidence against Schelling's hypothesis. It is more important to ask whether, as predicted by Hypothesis 2, payoffs were higher for favored than for unfavored players. For each of these ten cases, normalized payoff asymmetry is shown in the final column of Table 2A or 2B. NPA is positive in eight of these cases. To test for significant payoff asymmetry in the direction implied by Hypothesis 2, we use a one-tail Wilcoxon signed-rank test, comparing average payoffs to favored and unfavored players and using matching groups as the unit of observation. The results of this test are shown by the asterisks in the final columns of the tables.

For any given interaction, we define bargaining duration as the time that elapsed before an agreement was sealed, or as 90 seconds if no agreement was sealed before the deadline. For each game G1-G6 which appears in both Set I and Set II, there is no significant difference between the cumulative distributions of bargaining duration in the two cases. 18 More surprisingly, there is very little evidence that bargaining duration was affected by the presence or absence of spatial cues. 19 While bargaining duration is a convenient metric to use in conducting statistical tests, a plot of the cumulative distribution of bargaining duration does not allow us to see some interesting aspects of the bargaining process. Recall that our bargaining protocol did not require players to tick their accept boxes in order for their payoffs to be determined by the claims on the table at 90 seconds. In fact, it was not uncommon for interactions to end with no sealed agreement, but with claims that gave a nonzero payoff to one or both players. This was the case for 113 interactions (8.7 percent) in Set I and 336 interactions (22.2 percent) in Set II. Significantly, however, almost all of these interactions (103 in Set I, 310 in Set II) were ones in which at least one player changed her claims in the final five seconds of the interaction. It is natural to interpret these cases as ones in which the players had effectively agreed, but the change of claims that immediately preceded that agreement occurred so close to the deadline that the players did not have time to tick their accept boxes. (This interpretation is supported by the fact that, as we will show later, a high proportion of sealed agreements were reached in the final seconds.) Bargaining duration does not distinguish between these cases and interactions that ended with the players making conflicting claims.",

A (profitable) agreement was explicit if it was sealed within the 90 seconds available for bargaining, in which case the agreement time is the time, in seconds from the start of the interaction, when it was sealed. Thus, if an interaction ended without a sealed agreement but with a positive payoff for at least one player, this constitutes an implicit agreement.

Figures 2A and 2B report the cumulative distributions of agreement times for Sets I and II, respectively, averaging across games with the same disc collection. 20 Because of our conventions, the last point of each curve represents the net effect of implicit agreements, while the vertical distance between the last point and the 100 percent boundary represents the percentage of (0, 0) allocations (including the few cases in which such allocations resulted from sealed agreements).",

That most pairs were able to resolve this problem in a few seconds, even in the absence of spatial cues, is evidence of the transparency and flexibility of our bargaining protocol.

Cumulative percentage of agreements Third, and we suggest most important, all the graphs show the same three phases of agreement behavior, occurring in the same time intervals. The rate at which agreements are made is relatively high from 0 seconds to about 30 seconds. From then to about 80 seconds, this rate levels off, before increasing steeply in the final seconds of the interaction. Similar \"deadline effects\" have been found in other unstructured bargaining experiments (e.g., Roth, Murnighan, and Schoumaker 1988;Gneezy, Haruvy, and Roth 2003;Riedl 2005, 2006), and are consistent with the backward-induction logic of both Schelling's and Farrell's models of bargaining (see Introduction). The high rate of agreement in the first phase is more surprising, given that, in all phases of the game, most agreements were on one or other of the LUE allocations and that (as we will show later) failures to agree were usually the result of both players holding out for the higher LUE payoff. The implication is that any player could be reasonably certain of getting at least the lower LUE payoff by waiting until late in the game before conceding. Thus, a player who accepted the lower payoff early in the interaction passed up the chance of getting the higher payoff as a result of a concession by her opponent. 21",

            "text": "One might conjecture that players who are quicker at making claims in the first few seconds gain an advantage over their opponents. 22 We investigate this possibility by looking at the value of the discs that had been claimed by each player five seconds after the start of the game, excluding cases in which an agreement had already been sealed at that time. The value of the discs claimed by player L at five seconds minus the value of the discs claimed by R at five seconds provides a measure of the early claim advantage of L relative to R. By comparing this with the payoff difference in favor of L (that is, the final payoff to L minus the final payoff to R), we can ask whether players with a positive early claim advantage tended to achieve higher payoffs than their coplayers. However, in games with spatial cues, this comparison is subject to a potential confound. If players' first claims are of the discs closest to their bases, positive correlation between early claim advantage and final payoff asymmetry might indicate the effects of a common causal factor-the spatial layout of the discs. This problem can be avoided by confining the analysis to spatially neutral games. Regressing payoff difference in spatially neutral games against early claim advantage, we find a highly significant relationship ( p < 0.001) with a coefficient of 0.19 (implying that an early claim advantage of \u00a31 generates a payoff difference of \u00a30.19). 23 However, if data from early agreement interactions are excluded from this regression, the relationship between payoff difference and early claim advantage is much weaker, with a much smaller coefficient (0.08), which is only marginally significant ( p = 0.087). The implication is that early claim advantage had relatively little effect in the final phase of play. This perhaps reflects the fact that, as noted in Section VB, that phase typically began with both players maintaining claims with the same total value. In other words, any facts on the ground created by either player's early claim advantage had typically been erased before the final phase of play.",

Because of sampling variation in the formation of groups, one might expect heterogeneity at the individual level to induce some degree of heterogeneity at the group level. For each matching group and for each of the 18 games, we consider the number of agreements sealed by 60 seconds (an index of dovishness, i.e., the converse of hawkishness), and the number of interactions ending with the (0, 0) allocation (an index of hawkishness). For games with spatial cues, we also consider NPA (an index of spatial awareness). Using Kruskal-Wallis tests, we find strongly significant differences for the first two variables in both Set I and Set II, indicating substantial heterogeneity in hawkishness, but we find no evidence of heterogeneity in spatial awareness.",

We make such comparisons in respect of average efficiency, NPA (for games in which spatial cues suggest an unequal allocation), and bargaining duration. We find few cases of significant differences in efficiency between the two halves of either Set I or Set II sessions, and no overall pattern of increase or decrease. There is some evidence that NPA increased over the course of Set I sessions, suggesting that subjects were learning to make use of spatial cues, but there seems to be no trend (in either direction) in Set II sessions. Cumulative distributions of bargaining duration are sometimes significantly different between the first and second halves of sessions, but there is no overall pattern of increasing or decreasing duration. However, there seems to be some tendency for bargaining duration to increase in games in which the LUE allocation is very unequal (particularly in G28-G30), suggesting that subjects were learning to be more hawkish in such games.",

In most such agreements, one player accepted the lower LUE payoff and allowed the other player to take the higher payoff; in a small minority of cases, both players took the lower LUE payoff and some surplus was lost. This seems to indicate a dovish mode of bargaining-that is, a disinclination to contest for the larger share of the surplus-on the part of those players who accepted the lower LUE payoff early in the game. In contrast, the final 30 seconds of play seem to be best characterized as a contest between two hawkish players, both of whom were holding out for the higher payoff, postponing concession as long as they dared. Since the proportion of early agreement interactions is inversely related to the inequality of the LUE allocation, we know that subjects cannot be partitioned into unconditional hawks and unconditional doves. But the heterogeneity of hawkishness at the group level suggests some underlying heterogeneity at the individual level. The fact that the main effects of payoff-irrelevant cues were on early agreement interactions suggests, contrary to Schelling's \"midnight bell\" intuition, that those effects were mediated by the bargaining strategies of the more dovish players.",

Recall that if the LUE allocations are denoted by (x, y) and ( y, x), and the LIE allocation by (z, z), the design necessitates z \u2264 min(x, y). Nevertheless, the preponderance of LUE allocations in cases such as x = 7, y = 4, z = 4 (games G25-G27), and x = 10, y = 5, and z = 5 (games G28-G30), suggests a lack of concern by subjects about inequality. If subjects were averse to disadvantageous inequality, as hypothesized by Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and Bolton and Ockenfels (2000), player L in such a game would prefer (z, z) to ( y, x), and player R would prefer (z, z) to (x, y).

Thus, if the outcome of the game is unequal, its inequality may seem less objectionable because it has been reached by a procedure which respects equality of opportunity. This form of equality is particularly salient when, as was often the case in our experiment, the final stage of an interaction is a Chicken game in which the players maintain conflicting LUE claims as long as they individually dare. The hypothesis that people are more tolerant of ex post inequality if it is the result of a fair procedure has been proposed before, but fairness has usually been understood in terms of players' intentions (e.g., Falk, Fehr, and Fischbacher 2003;Bolton, Brandts, and Ockenfels 2005).

Nevertheless, spatial cues had some influence on players' payoffs. In games in which efficiency could be achieved only at the cost of an asymmetry in payoffs, players faced the problem of coordinating on which of them would take the larger share of the available surplus. In such games, payoff-irrelevant cues which favored one player relative to the other tended to skew the outcome of the game to the advantage of the former.

As shown byIsoni et al. (2013), games in which all discs are equidistant from the two bases have much weaker spatial cues than games in which discs are split between the two halves of the table. An alternative form of control, in which spatial neutrality is defined by the absence of bases, will be considered in Section VI.8 A \"collection,\" unlike a set, can contain two or more identical items. Thus, for example, {5, 5} and {5} are distinct collections.",

But if this disc is transferred from L to R, the resulting (efficient) allocation is less unequal than (x, y), contradicting the assumption that (x, y) is LUE. So there must be a disc worth exactly x. Since this disc is worth more than all the others combined, it must be left on the table in an equal allocation.",

This reduces the sample size to 36 and 42 observations for each comparison in Sets I and II, respectively, but ensures that each observation refers to the same group of individuals.19 Cross-game comparisons between cumulative distributions of bargaining durations are based on two-tail Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Significant differences in bargaining duration between games with spatial cues and corresponding spatially neutral games were found only for G8, G21, and G26. In all three cases, the presence of spatial cues shortened bargaining duration. For each game with spatial cues, we also compared the frequency of \"profitable agreements\" (i.e., interactions ending with a positive payoff for at least one player) with that in the corresponding spatially neutral game, and we found no significant difference.",
