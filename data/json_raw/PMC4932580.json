            "text": "This study investigated the degree to which instrumental measurements explain the variation in pork loin tenderness as assessed by the sensory evaluation of trained panelists. Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS) had a significant relationship with the sensory tenderness variables, such as softness, initial tenderness, chewiness, and rate of breakdown. In a regression analysis, WBS could account variations in these sensory variables, though only to a limited proportion of variation. On the other hand, three parameters from texture profile analysis (TPA)-hardness, gumminess, and chewiness-were significantly correlated with all sensory evaluation variables. In particular, from the result of stepwise regression analysis, TPA hardness alone explained over 15% of variation in all sensory evaluation variables, with the exception of perceptible residue. Based on these results, TPA analysis was found to be better than WBS measurement, with the TPA parameter hardness likely to prove particularly useful, in terms of predicting pork loin tenderness as rated by trained panelists. However, sensory evaluation should be conducted to investigate practical pork tenderness perceived by consumer, because both instrumental measurements could explain only a small portion (less than 20%) of the variability in sensory evaluation."

            "text": "Meat quality is defined by those traits that consumers perceive as desirable, such as visual appearance, edibility and credence quality (van der Wal et al., 1997;Warner et al., 2010;Lee et al., 2012). At the point of sale, visual traits such as color, leanness, amount and distribution of fat, and the absence of excess water in the tray influence consumer purchase decisions. At the point of consumption, consumer satisfaction is mainly determined by edibility (Becker, 2000;Glitsch, 2000). Consumer's eating satisfaction, which is primarily associated with tenderness, juiciness and flavor, subsequently influence the intention to repurchase (Maltin et al., 1997;Lee et al., 2012). In general, tenderness is considered the most important palatability trait (Warner et al., 2010). Many researchers have reported that the main source of consumer complaints and/or the most common cause of failure to repurchase is variation in tenderness, in particular the presence of toughness (Jeremiah, 1982;Tarrant, 1998;Bindon and Jones, 2001;Maltin et al., 2003). By the same token, consumers are willing to pay a premium for the meat that is guaranteed to be tender (Boleman et al., 1997). Thus, the production of consistently tender meat is of primary concern to meat science and the meat industry.",

            "text": "There are various methods available to measure meat tenderness, including instrumental, histological, and chemical evaluation; however, sensory evaluation is considered the ultimate method (Larmond, 1976). Sensory evaluation is the result of scoring done by trained or consumer panelists (Wood et al., 2004). The use of trained panelists is useful for comparing differences or investigating particular characteristics, but usually cannot provide information regarding the acceptability of or preference for one kind of meat over another to consumers (Wheeler et al., 1997;Destefanis et al., 2008;Warriss, 2010). On the other hand, sensory consumer opinion as measured by consumer panelists is a key factor in establishing the value of meat and predicting purchasing decisions (Destefanis et al., 2008). Despite its obvious benefit, sensory evaluation is expensive, difficult to organize, and time consuming, regardless of whether the panelists are trained professionals or consumers (Peachey et al., 2002;Platter et al., 2003;Destefanis et al., 2008). Consequently, many attempts have been made to develop instrumental methods that can accurately reflect the meat tenderness ratings generated by panels (Lawrie and Ledward, 2006;Destefanis et al., 2008). However, sensory evaluation and instrumental methods cannot measure the same physical properties of meat (Hansen et al., 2004). Sensory evaluation determine that meat tenderness is a result of the type and rate of deformation and the heterogeneity of the sample, whereas instrumental measured only a resistance of external physical force (Hansen et al., 2004). For instance, instrumental methods assess the force required to shear, compress, penetrate, bite, stretch, and mince the meat (Lawrie and Ledward, 2006).",

However, the correlation between WBS and sensory tenderness is known to vary considerably (Culioli, 1995;Caine et al., 2003;Platter et al., 2003;de Huidobro et al., 2005;Destefanis et al., 2008). Variability in the relationship between WBS and sensory tenderness depends in many factors including muscle type, sample preparation, cooking methods, shear apparatus, measurement procedure and panel type (Destefanis et al., 2008). Moreover, WBS measurement has a limitation to imitate fully the complexity of the chewing motion (Caine et al., 2003). Texture profile analysis (TPA) is another common method used to evaluate the texture of various food items, with one advantage to assess multiple variables at one time measurement. For meat, these variables include hardness, cohesiveness, springiness and chewiness (de Huidobro et al., 2005). The relationship between sensory evaluation and various instrumental measurements of beef tenderness has been investigated in previous researches, and it has been reported that TPA is a superior indicator of the beef tenderness assessed by panelists compared to WBS (Caine et al., 2003;de Huidobro et al., 2005). However, few studies have investigated the relationship between sensory and instrumental evaluation of pork tenderness, even though tenderness is an important quality for this meat (Jeremiah, 1982;Hansen et al., 2004). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the degree to which the two common instrumental measurements, WBS and TPA, can explain variation in pork tenderness as assessed by trained panelists.",

TPA measurement was performed using a texture analyzer (TA-XT2i, Stable Micro System, Surrey, England). Cube samples were placed under a 10 mm diameter cylindrical probe. The probe moved downwards at a constant speed of 3.0 mm/s (pre-test), 1.0 mm/s (test) and 3.0 mm/s (post-test). The probe continued downward until penetrating a predetermined percentage of the sample thickness (75%), retracted to the initial point of contact with the sample, and stopped for a set time period (2 s) before initiation of the second compression cycle. During the test, the force of the sample was recorded every 0.01 s and plotted on a forcetime plot (de Huidobro et al., 2005). The force-time data from each test were recorded, and at least 6 tests were used to calculate the mean values for the TPA parameters of each sample. Hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, gumminess and chewiness were calculated following the standard procedure (Bourne, 1978;Honikel, 1998).",

Of the sensory evaluation variables measured in this study, softness and initial tenderness were associated with the first aspect, chewiness and rate of breakdown with the second, and the amount of perceptible residue with the third. Juiciness and mouth coating were also assessed by the trained panelists, both of which could influence sensory tenderness by softening the meat during chewing (Aberle, 2001). In general, juiciness has two organoleptic components: i) the impression of wetness during initial chews due to the rapid release of meat fluid and ii) sustained juiciness due to the stimulatory effect of fat on salivation (Lawrie and Ledward, 2006).

Although the regression models were significant, their regression coefficients were remarkably low (from 0.031 for sensory softness to 0.072 for sensory chewiness). Stepwise analysis using the TPA parameters resulted in significant regression models for all sensory evaluation variables ( Table 5). The TPA-hardness, cohesiveness and springiness were selected to predict the sensory evaluation of pork loin tenderness; in particular, every regression model included hardness. These results were similar to the study on beef tenderness in which WBS predicted only those sensory variables directly related to beef tenderness (hardness and number of chewings), but TPA parameters predicted both the direct sensory tenderness variables and sensory juiciness (de Huidobro et al., 2005).  Stepwise regression analysis was also performed to estimate the proportion of variation in the sensory evaluation of pork loin tenderness explained by both WBS and TPA parameters ( Table 6). The TPA-hardness was selected in all regression models, accounting for over 15% of the variation in sensory softness, initial tenderness, chewiness, and rate of breakdown. However, the WBS and TPA parameters explained less 10% of variation in the amount of perceptible residue, juiciness, and mouth coating. Other studies have reported much stronger coefficients of correlation and regression between sensory evaluation variables and instrumental measurements (Caine et al., 2003;de Huidobro et al., 2005). For instance, WBS explained approximately 36% of the variation in initial tenderness and overall tenderness, and the TPA-hardness and adhesiveness accounted for over 46% of the variability in the sensory tenderness of beef rib steak (Caine et al., 2003). In another study, WBS and TPA parameters explained approximately 9% and 23%, respectively, of the variation in the sensory hardness of cooked beef loin, although the regression coefficients were relatively low (de Huidobro et al., 2005).",

There may be four possible reasons for this observation (Warriss, 2010). The first is the lack of precision arising from the use of sensory panelists because of the subjective nature of the measurements, e.g., differing scales of perception for tenderness. In this study, pork loin tenderness was assessed by trained panelists capable of producing consistent and reproducible data, and thus there were no significant differences between panelists when the same samples were assessed by trained panelists, and between the same sample when the same sample was assessed by the same panelists.",

            "text": "The second explanation is the confounding effect of juiciness on meat tenderness (Warriss, 2010). Perception of meat tenderness by consumers is a complex interaction of physical and sensory (e.g. juiciness) processing during mastication (Jeremiah, 1982;Caine et al., 2003;Warriss, 2010). But juiciness, regardless of whether it is the result of the release of meat fluid during chewing or the stimulatory effect of fat on salivation, is difficult to measure using instrumental methods. Although TPA parameters were associated with sensory juiciness both in this study and in another study (de Huidobro et al., 2005), difficulty to measure effect of the juiciness on meat tenderness may be the reason for the weak relationship between the sensory evaluation and instrumental measurement of pork loin  tenderness. The third reason for the weak relationship between sensory evaluation and instrumental measurements could be related to variation in the cooking methods, cooking temperature, and holding temperature before testing (Warriss, 2010). In the present study, the samples used for sensory evaluation were cooked in a humid oven at 180\u00b0C, whereas samples for the instrumental measurements were cooked in boiling water. Cooking methods using water exhibit higher cooking loss and WBS values compared to the other cooking methods (Dzudie et al., 2000;Huff-Lonergan et al., 2002;Obuz et al., 2003). Moreover, higher cooking temperatures are known to result in also higher cooking loss (less juiciness) and tougher meat (Aaslying et al., 2003;Obuz et al., 2003;Combes et al., 2004). In terms of holding temperature, it was reported that variation between sensory evaluation and objective measurements may be minimized if the instrumental measurements are performed immediately after cooking (Caine et al., 2003). For example, higher holding temperatures after cooking on a belt grill resulted in higher cooking loss and less tender beef (Obuz et al., 2003). That is, the cooking procedure may be related to the second explanation, with different cooking procedure resulting in different water loss and succulence. However, as mentioned above, instrumental methods cannot take into account succulence. This combine effect of cooking procedure and instrumental limitation may be account for low correlation between sensory and instrumental measurements in this study.",

To imitate the mastication process, the probe halts and retracts prior to penetrating the last 25% of the sample thickness during TPA measurement (de Huidobro et al., 2005). However, the shear device used to measure WBS completely severs each sample. That is why the data dispersion of the TPA parameters was lower than that of WBS, and similar to that of the sensory evaluation variables, an outcome that is in agreement with other studies (Caine et al., 2003;de Huidobro et al., 2005) and which may also explain the closer relationship between the TPA parameters and the sensory variables.",

However, neither WBS nor TPA measurements could explain a significant proportion of the variation in the sensory evaluation of pork loin tenderness. Therefore, sensory evaluation should be conducted to investigate practical pork tenderness perceived by consumer."
