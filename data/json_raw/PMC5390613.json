            "text": "Objective: To quantitatively measure hepatic fibrosis on gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and identify the correlations with aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) values. Materials and Methods: This study on gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3T MR imaging included 81 patients with CHB infection. To quantitatively measure hepatic fibrosis, MR images were analyzed with an aim to identify inhomogeneous signal intensities calculated from a coefficient of variation (CV) map in the liver parenchyma. We also carried out a comparative analysis between APRI and FIB-4 based on metaregression results. The diagnostic performance of the CV map was evaluated using a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: In the MR images, the mean CV values in control, groups I, II, and III based on APRI were 4.08 \u00b1 0.92, 4.24 \u00b1 0.80, 5.64 \u00b1 1.11, and 5.73 \u00b1 1.28, respectively (p < 0.001). In CHB patients grouped by FIB-4, the mean CV values of groups A, B, and C were 4.22 \u00b1 0.95, 5.40 \u00b1 1.19, and 5.71 \u00b1 1.17, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean CV values correlated well with APRI (r = 0.392, p < 0.001) and FIB-4 (r = 0.294, p < 0.001). In significant fibrosis group, ROC curve analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.875 using APRI and 0.831 using FIB-4 in HB, respectively. Conclusion: Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging for calculating a CV map showed moderate correlation with APRI and FIB-4 values and could be employed to quantitatively measure hepatic fibrosis in patients with CHB.",

            "text": "Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) has a high prevalence in Asia. If left untreated, it can lead to serious conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver cirrhosis (LC), esophageal varices, or hepatic encephalopathy. In Korea, hepatitis B was the most common cause of the underlying liver diseases in HCC patients (1)(2)(3)(4). The liver biopsy is a gold-standard modality for evaluating the hepatic fibrosis and its stage. However, repeated liver biopsy for fibrosis evaluation has several limitations, including sampling errors related to the sample size and complications such as pain and hemorrhage (5,6). As such, there is a need https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2017. 18 kjronline.org for a noninvasive evaluation of liver fibrosis. Noninvasive assessment methods of liver fibrosis can be divided into three categories: serological markers, fibrosis biomarkers, and imaging techniques. In many previous studies, multiple serological marker-based indices have been proposed, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, age-platelet count index, and AST/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, and these have exhibited good correlations with the pathology of liver fibrosis (7)(8)(9). These indices are inexpensive and simple, as they incorporate routine laboratory results that are readily available in most of the hospital laboratories. Of the above-mentioned indices, APRI and FIB-4 provide an accurate assessment of liver fibrosis in CHB patients and are used as reference modalities for liver fibrosis (10). Recently, from a meta-analysis study, Xiao et al. (11) reported that APRI and FIB-4 possess moderate diagnostic accuracy for predicting fibrosis in patients with CHB viral infection. Among the serological markers, the two indices still could be considered as options for predicting fibrosis from CHB infection in regions with limited healthcare resources.",

            "text": "Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid or gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) is an extracellular, hepatocyte-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent used to evaluate focal hepatic lesions such as HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, and hemangioma, as well as for liver perfusion, extracellular diffusion, and bile excretion analysis (11)(12)(13)(14). This contrast agent is absorbed by organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPB1/B3) and metabolized in hepatocytes during the hepatobiliary (HB) phase, which occurs approximately 15-20 minutes after injection (15)(16)(17). In LC, the expression level and activity of OATPB1/B3 are decreased, and the liver signal intensity in the HB phase is weaker in the cirrhotic portion relative to the normal liver parenchyma, yielding decreased signal intensity and inhomogeneous enhancement during the HB phase. In previous studies, the histogram in HB phase was well correlated with liver fibrosis grade and this notion was supported by the fact that heterogeneity in HB phase may be correlated with liver fibrosis grade (16)(17)(18)(19).",

The following procedure was used to calculate the CV map: bias correction of intensity inhomogeneity, followed by calculation of the CV map by dividing the CV value by each pixel value in the circular region of interest (ROI; diameter = 40 pixels) and, finally, calculating the mean value on the CV map ( Fig. 1). Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced axial images obtained during the HB phase MR image were obtained in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format and stored on console containing the MATLAB-based program. For quantitative measurements of liver parenchymal heterogeneity, two abdominal radiologists (with 24 years of experience and with 4 years of experience in abdominal imaging), blinded to clinical information and pathological fibrosis grades, performed the procedure by positioning separate circular ROIs (diameter = 40 pixels) on the selected MR images, which was bias-corrected. In all subjects, ROIs were placed on the anterior segment of the right hepatic lobe with no overlap over large vessels and focal lesions such as cysts or tumors (Fig. 2). Each radiologist measured ROIs 3 times in the selected MR images and calculated the mean.",

Progressive liver fibrosis has been reported to reduce OATPB1/B3 activity and features the activation of collagen-producing hepatic stellate cells, collagen deposition in the subendothelial space of Disse, and all of which may promote the development of a fibrotic barrier in the liver parenchyma and reduced Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake (27)(28)(29). It was also supported by another literature. In a study by Tsuda and Matsui (29), higher levels of MRP2 activity were observed in cirrhotic rats, indicating that advanced liver fibrosis may lead to earlier Gd-EOB-DTPA excretion. Therefore, the absence of even distribution of Gd-EOB-DTPA in all liver parenchymal compartments and hepatocytes has been observed after administration of the contrast agent to CHB patients, thus leading to inhomogeneous enhancement of the liver parenchyma.",

First, this type of liver fibrosis assessment is very simple and does not require new imaging equipment. Recently, MR elastography, ultrasonographic elastography, and fibroscan were developed for liver fibrosis evaluation. However, all of these techniques require new imaging equipment, thus placing a restriction on access (32,33). Second, CV mapping does not require any additional  kjronline.org MR scanning. This technique is mediated by software and objectively quantifies liver parenchymal heterogeneity. Third, heterogeneity measurements require only Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, which includes information about the liver function and simultaneously facilitates HCC screening. Fourth, measurement using CV mapping is highly reproducible, which is revealed by a high interobserver agreement of 0.947 between the most experienced radiologist and one with less experience. Any radiologist or clinician can use the CV value on HB phase MR image by following simple instructions using this software. Nowadays, Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI has become popular and has revealed high diagnostic accuracy for HCC surveillance. Based on our results, it is hypothesized that the CV values would impart an additional value for Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR in predicting advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, and a radiologist or clinician could pay attention to the patients with high CV values. Further study is needed for analyzing the correlation between CV values and pathologic fibrosis grades.",

As a result, we depended on clinical data to obtain a reference degree of liver fibrosis and evaluated the heterogeneity of liver enhancement effects based on APRI and FIB-4, rather than on the histological grading of fibrosis. Second, we positioned the ROI at the right anterior or posterior segment of the liver (segments 5/6 and 7/8) because this area does not contain major vessels and is far from the heart, thus reducing the incidence of cardiac motion artifacts. However, the CV of the ROI area is not representative of the whole liver, and thus some selection bias might have occurred. Third, this was a retrospective study and the APRI and FIB-4 values were used for a reference liver fibrosis assessment; accordingly, we included laboratory data obtained within 7 days from the Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI study date to minimize the influence of factors other than liver fibrosis on the AST and platelet levels.
