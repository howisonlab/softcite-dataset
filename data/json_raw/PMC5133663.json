Recent data obtained in bovine sperm showed that sperm capacitation is associated to the formation of oxysterols, oxidized products of cholesterol. The aim of this study was to profile oxysterol content in human semen, and to investigate their potential role in sperm pathophysiology. Among the 12 oxysterols analyzed, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) resulted the most represented in normozoospermic samples, and its concentration positively correlated with spermatozoa number. We detected Cholesterol 25hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for 25-HC production, in human spermatozoa at the level of the neck and the post acrosomal area. Upon incubation with spermatozoa, 25-HC induced calcium and cholesterol transients in connection with the acrosomal reaction. Our results support a role for 25-HC in sperm function.",

Fertilizing capacity of sperm cells is acquired during their passage through the epididymis [1]. Cholesterol, a main component of cell membrane system, affects sperm membrane fluidity, and promotes the complex mechanism leading to the evolution of a capacitated state, which is ultimately completed in the female reproductive tract. Cholesterol excreted from the epididymal epithelium contributes to the maturation of transiting sperm [2], and cholesterol content in sperm membrane is tight regulated during epididymal transit [1].",

            "text": "De Lamirande and Gagnon [8] highlighted the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration in sperm capacitation. Mild ROS formation would favor signaling events that are involved in sperm capacitation [9,10]; on the other hand, higher rates of ROS formation would result in irreversible deterioration of sperm cell function [11]. Concerning ROS-mediated mechanisms in sperm function, most attention has been reserved to phospholipid peroxidation [12]. Little attention has been devoted to cholesterol by-products generated by autoxidation, i.e. oxysterols, notwithstanding cholesterol is the most abundant lipid component of sperm cells, and is an excellent sensor of lipid peroxidation [13]. In addition, cholesterol can be transformed enzymatically into oxysterols that collectively are recognized as potent bioactive molecules [13]. Recently, Brouwers et al. [14] reported on the presence and formation of oxysterols in bovine sperm, and showed the formation of oxysterols during capacitation. These results represent a significant advance in our understanding of the redox regulation of sperm capacitation, opening new perspectives of study on the mechan-isms that regulate the male fertility physiology. Since oxysterols are more hydrophilic than cholesterol, they move more freely out of the membrane and may account for most of the actions currently attributed to cholesterol.",

Sperm cells were recovered from density gradient, as described above, and were rinsed with PBS Buffer. Cells (6\u00d710 5 ) were cytospun for 5 min at 100 x g onto a glass slide. Cells spot was fixed in PFA 4% for 15 min at RT. After the spots were incubated with PBS-NH 4 Cl 50 mM to quench PFA autofluorescence and permealized with Triton X100 0.5%. Cells were blocked with PBS-gelatin 0.2% for 45 min and incubated with primary antibody against Ch25H (1:50) in PBS-gelatin 0.2% o/n at 4\u00b0C in a wet chamber. After cells were incubated with anti-mouse 488 Alexafluor secondary antibody (1:500) for 45 min at RT in the dark. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1:1000) for 5 min. To exclude unspecific fluorescence signal, negative control experiments were carried out using the secondary antibody in the absence of the antibody against cholesterol 25-hydroxylase. As positive control for Ch25H detection we used THP-1 cell line (ATCC TIB-202), as they are known to express the enzyme. The slides were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM4000 B) with 1000X magnification.",

We found a positive correlation between 25-HC concentration and spermatozoa number. Even if 25-HC can be potentially formed by autoxidation mechanisms [23,24], it's produced almost entirely by the enzyme Cholesterol 25hydroxylase [22]. We showed that Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase protein is widely expressed in the seminiferous area of the testis, and perdured in matured spermatozoa, where the enzyme is located in the neck and the post acrosomal area. In addition, we provided evidence for a functional role of 25-HC in sperm male fertility. In fact, this oxysterol was able to induce calcium and cholesterol trafficking compatible with a capacitating activity. The most fully characterized biochemical event during capacitation is the modification of intracellular concentration of calcium ions (Ca ++ ). Increase in Ca ++ transients during capacitation has been reported in several mammalian species, including human [25]. The process of spermatogenesis is characterized by morphological transformation, which occurs in the testis where round germ cells undergo division, meiosis and differentiation to form haploid, elongated spermatids. During spermatogenesis, dynamic changes occur in membrane lipid composition, including a significant accumulation of cholesterol and its precursors as a result of stage-specific expression of cholesterol synthesis genes [26]. The functional role of sterols in sperm maturation is supported by changes in sterol composition in spermatozoa membranes during epididymal transit [1], which is also controlled by epididymal epithelium that possesses the ability to synthesize and extrude cholesterol [2,27]. Therefore, the role of cholesterol and related sterols in sperm maturation and male fertility has since long been recognized but the mechanism/s involved remains elusive. In particular, little is known about oxysterols, compounds derived from cholesterol transformation by enzymatic and autoxidation mechanisms. To date, these molecules have been identified only in animal models [2]. Spermatozoa complete their fertilizing capacity in the female reproductive tract by capacitation. During this process some of the major changes involve sterol oxidation and their efflux from the plasma membrane, changes in the surface expression of a variety of proteins and receptors for the zona pellucida, the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation, and the expression of hyper activated motility [28]. One of the first changes in spermatozoa capacitation process is a loss of cholesterol and related sterols from the sperm plasma membrane [29].",
