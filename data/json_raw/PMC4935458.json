            "text": "Hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum (LF) is one of the key pathomechanisms of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 is abundantly expressed in hypertrophied degenerative LF tissues from LSS. However, the molecular mechanisms underling the association between TGF-\u03b21 and LF hypertrophy have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the important role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the pathogenesis of LSS by analyzing the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and extracellular matrix (ECM) components (collagen I and collagen III) in TGF-\u03b21-treated LF cells. Cell growth assay revealed that TGF-\u03b21, in association with CTGF, enhanced the the proliferation of LF cells, and we found that TGF-\u03b21 also elevated CTGF expression and subsequently enhanced the mRNA expression of collagen I and collagen III. The increased mRNA expression levels of CTGF, collagen I and collagen III were abolished by p38 inhibitors. Both immunofluorescence imaging and western blot analysis of p38 and p-p38 revealed the increased expression and phosphorylation of p38. Silencing the expression of p38 by siRNA in LF cells decreased the protein expression of p38, p-p38 and CTGF, as well as the mRNA expression of CTGF, collagen I and collagen III. Taken together, our findings indicate that TGF-\u03b21, in association with the increased expression of CTGF, contribute to the homeostasis of the ECM and to the hypertrophy of LF through the p38 MAPK pathway."

Degenerative changes in the posterior structures of the lumbar spine, such as hypertrophy of the facet joints and ligamentum flavum (LF), in combination with degenerative spondylolisthesis, can contribute to the development of LSS (2). The hypertrophy of the LF has been described in anatomic studies to be 7-to 8-mm-thick in patients with central stenosis, as opposed to the usual 4 mm or less (2). Although it is agreed that spinal mechanical stress (3) and secreted cytokines (4) from the herniated disk accelerate the hypertrophy of the LF, which contributes to the development of LSS, the detailed underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood.",

Common pathological characteristics in the degenerated LF are the loss of elastic fibers and tissue fibrosis, and increased collagen in tissues (6)(7)(8). Mechanical stress increases the production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 in several cell lines, including LF cells isolated from surgically resected LF (9,10). TGF-\u03b21 is a key factor in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis (11) and is abundantly expressed in hypertrophied degenerative LF tissues from LSS (12)(13)(14). TGF-\u03b21 increases collagen expression in LF cells (15). These previous studies suggest that TGF-\u03b21 plays an important role in the hypertrophy of the LF and thus in the pathogenesis of LSS. However, the molecular mechanisms underling the association between TGF-\u03b21 and LF hypertrophy, particularly the mechanisms underlying the TGF-\u03b21-induced increase in collagen expression have not yet been fully elucidated.",

The association between TGF-\u03b21 and LF hypertrophy has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that TGF-\u03b21 enhanced the expression of CTGF at both the mRNA and protein level, further supporting the existence of an interaction between CTGF and TGF-\u03b21, as described in a previous study (27). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 elevated the mRNA expression of ECM components, including collagen I and III, and this effect was abolished by the CTGF NA, indicating that TGF-\u03b21 contributes to the hypertrophy of the LF in association with CTGF.

In this study, we found that TGF-\u03b21 enhanced the proliferation of LF cells, and this associated with an increase in CTGF expression. However, with the addition of CTGF NA, the promoting effects of TGF-\u03b21 on the proliferation of LF cells were abrogated (Fig. 3). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21, in association with CTGF, regulates the synthesis of ECM components (16,18). The increased synthesis of collagen is a major characteristic of LF hypertrophy (10). LF cells have a typical fibroblastlike phenotype, as they express type I and type III collagen and fibronectin, but do not stain positive for osteonectin (23). Normal cells do not synthesize type II collagen (23). Type I and type III collagen have been found to be predominant in human LF (28). In this study, we also observed that TGF-\u03b21 increased the mRNA expression of collagen I and collagen III, and this effect was abrogated by CTGF NA, indicating that the TGF-\u03b21-induced synthesis of ECM components is associated with CTGF. TGF-\u03b21 elevated the expression of CTGF at both the mRNA and protein level (Fig. 4). Therefore, TGF-\u03b21, in association with CTGF, contributed to the hypertrophy of the LF.",

In addition to the activation of Smad signaling, TGF-\u03b21 can activate members of the MAPK pathway, as well as other kinases (31,32). Upon stimulation with TGF-\u03b2, the crosstalk between the ERK, p38, JNK and Smad pathways is cell type-specific (33,34). Previous studies have shown the pro-fibrotic activities of p38 and ERK signaling, and the anti-fibrotic activities of JNK signaling (27). The pathway involved in the TGF-\u03b21-induced hypertrophy of the LF has not been addressed to date, to the best of our knowledge. In this study, among ERK, p38, and JNK, only the use of the p38 inhibitor abolished the mRNA expression of CTGF, and collagen I and III (Fig. 5), indicating the profibrotic activities of p38 signaling. We further observed that the expression and phosphorylation level of p38 were enhanced by TGF-\u03b21. Following the silencing of p38 MAPK (its efficiency over time was almost the same; data not shown), the expression and phosphorylation level of p38, as well as the mRNA expression of CTGF, collagen I and collagen III were attenuated correspondingly, as well as the expression of CTGF (Fig. 6). Apparently, the expression of p38 and p-p38 presented in Fig. 6A does not match that shown in Fig. 6B. It is worth noting that the immunofluorescence staining in this study was focused on the cell surface, that should limit the detection of intracellular signaling, but the western blot analysis included all the intracellular and cell surface information. These results further confirm that p38 MAPK is a key mediator of the effects of TGF-\u03b21, and the pro-fibrotic activities of p38 signaling.",

Degenerative changes in the posterior structures of the lumbar spine, such as the hypertrophy of the facet joints and LF, in combination with degenerative spondylolisthesis, contribute to the development of LSS (2). Patients with LSS usually present with the typical symptoms of neurogenic claudication and/or lumbar or sacral radiculopathy (35,36). Many patients may also complain of pain when performing activities requiring the extension of the spine. These symptoms may improve with appropriate conservative treatment, although 60-85% of patients undergo surgical treatments (35). Our observations appear to be important for evaluating the pathomechanisms of LSS, and may prove to be helpful in the diagnosis and prevention of LSS in the early stage, and may also provide an effective alternative to surgery.",
