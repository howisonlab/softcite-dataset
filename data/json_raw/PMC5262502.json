            "text": "Bisphosphonates (BPs) have recently been shown to have direct anti-tumor properties. Systemic treatment with BPs can have multiple adverse effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and BP induced bone fracturing and spine instability. While benefits of systemic BP treatments may outweigh risks, local treatment with BPs has been explored as an alternate strategy to reduce unwarranted risk. In the present study, we examined whether local delivery of BPs inhibits tumor-induced osteolysis and tumor growth more effectively than systemic treatment in an animal model of tumor-induced bone disease. Following establishment of an intra-tibial model of bone metastases in athymic mice, the experimental group was treated by local administration of zoledronate into the tibial lesion. A comparison of the effect of local versus systemic delivery of zoledronate on the formation of tumor-induced osteolysis was also carried out. A significant increase in mean bone volume/tissue volume % (BV/TV) of the locally treated group (12.30 \u00b1 2.80%) compared to the control group (7.13 \u00b1 1.22%) (P < 0.001). Additionally, there was a significant increase in the BV/TV (10.90 \u00b1 1.25%) in the locally treated group compared to the systemically treated group (7.53 \u00b1 0.75%) (P=0.005). These preliminary results suggest that local delivery of BPs outperforms both systemic and control treatments to inhibit tumor-induced osteolysis.",

            "text": "Bone metastases are the most common bone tumor, and they are often derived from solid tumours of the breast, prostate, lung and bladder [1]. Bone metastases are also the most common cause of cancer-related bone pain and often lead to additional complications such as pathological fracture and spine compressions, all of which can severely diminish patients' quality of life [2]. Treatment of bone metastases imposes a huge burden on the healthcare system, and with the advancement in healthcare and increase in cancer life expectancy, metastatic bone disease is projected to increase dramatically [3]. Current treatment options for bone metastases are surgical therapy, radiotherapy, anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) antibody, and systemic bisphosphonates (BPs).",

BPs have also been shown to elicit combinatorial effects with chemotherapeutic agents. They are often administered to breast or prostate cancer patients with metastatic bone disease as a single intravenous dose or course of treatment as part of the standard care regimen [7,8].

The increase in the apoptosis in the treated group was mirrored with decrease in the mean percentage of proliferation (29.4 \u00b1 14.4%) in the treatment group when compared to the control group (44.9 \u00b1 7.7%) (P = 0.10) (Fig. 3).",

Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of \u03bc-CT images, established using the coronal (midline) and axial cut (5 mm from the growth plate), further demonstrated an increase in trabecular bone volume in the locallytreated tibiae when compared to the systemically-treated group (Fig. 4B).

Gangi et al. reported the use of percutaneous alcohol injection directly into bone tumours in 25 patients with painful vertebral metastases, which resulted in effective pain reduction and improved quality of life [14]. On the other hand, several studies reported local delivery of BPs for treating multiple bone pathologies [19,20]. Local elution of zoledronate from titanium implants in animal studies showed to increase in the net bone formation with clear signs of improved vascularity, maturity, and remodelling [19]. Locally-delivered BP was also used to improve mechanical stability of implants [21] and to enhance bone formation in an osteoporotic model [22]. Nevertheless, this is the first study to examine the effect of direct delivery of BPs into the site of bone metastasis.",

We have used a high dose (2 \u03bc) of BP three times/week to simulate a sustained release of BP from an implant. Our results demonstrated that local delivery of BPs significantly inhibited tumor-induced osteolysis in the treatment group; in fact, it preserved the bone completely. We also observed a substantial effect of BPs on tumor-induced osteolysis, as well as a trend for inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. A comparison between the local and the systemic delivery of BPs demonstrated that the anti-osteolytic effect of local delivery of BPs in a model of tumorinduced bone disease exceeds that of the systemic effect. Several studies have investigated the effect of systemic zoledronate on tumorinduced osteolysis [23,[25][26][27]. Buijs et al.

In the present study, local delivery also likely blocked osteolysis by inhibiting osteoclast function. Despite using a relatively high dose of zoledronate (2 \u03bcg) directly at the site of bone tumor one week after cancer cell implantation, our results showed a trend that tumor growth was less in the treatment versus control groups. These results were somewhat consistent with what is reported in the literature [29,30]. Buijs et al. [23] demonstrated that zoledronate significantly inhibited tumor-induced bone resorption. However, it did not inhibit local tumor growth. In addition, Pluijm et al. [31] examined the effect of pamidronate and olpadronate in an intra-tibial model of bone metastases. Treatment regimen started at day three after cancer cell implantation. Their results showed that BPs inhibited osteolysis, yet it did not affect tumor growth. From the review of the literature, it seems that BPs treatment inhibits tumor growth in preclinical animal models only when treatment starts before the establishment of bone metastases. However, once the tumor reaches a certain size, it is difficult to control the tumor growth with just BPs administration [31]. Moreover, it has been suggested that the BPs' high affinity for bone minerals bound their direct anti-tumor effect on the tumor cells in vivo [32].",

To minimize bias, we divided the mice into two control groups, one for systemic and one for local drug delivery. The rationale behind this randomization is a hypothetical effect of the increase in bone formation in the local group due to the repeated micro-fractures caused by our injection. However, the comparison between the two controls revealed no significant statistical difference (P=0.30). On the other hand, we observed a significant increase in the BV/TV in the local group compared to the systemic group, with a net increase of 44.8%. These results showed that the effect of local delivery of zoledronate in bone metastases model is superior that of the systemic treatment. This has been explained by the fact that half the dose of systemic zoledronate reaches the bone with a short half-life of ten days [33]. Our results suggest that a larger percentage of the dose reaches the bone; however, to our knowledge, there are no studies on the pharmacokinetics of direct injection of zoledronate.",

            "text": "Two major factors favor the use of local over systemic delivery with BPs. Given the anti-osteolysis effect of zoledronate, it can be utilized in cases where complete resection of bone tumor is not possible due to vital structures invasion. It can be delivered by local elution from implants or by image guidance injections in case surgical intervention is not feasible. The effect on tumor growth, however, is still question-able and needs further investigation. On the other hand, high doses of systemic BP is required to achieve clinical efficacious concentration for neoplastic bone metastasis. This required high systemic BP route can cause severe renal toxicity, while oral administration is complicated by poor bioavailability ( < 1% in humans) and poor gastrointestinal tolerability. In addition, other side effects of systemic BPs treatment have been reported in the literature include joint pain, jaw osteonecrosis [10], ocular inflammation [34], and compromised bone growth in children [35]. Local delivery can provide direct delivery of zoledronate to the site of bone tumor without passing the systemic circulation, thus, avoiding undesirable side effects and ensuring better bioavailability.",

Additionally, the comparison between local and systemic delivery unexpectedly revealed that local delivery was more effective in osteolysis inhibition. Although tumor growth was not significantly inhibited, the noted effect on apoptosis of intra-tumor delivery of zoledronate triggers the need for further assessment of its anti-tumor properties. Also, further work needs to be performed to compare systemic effects of zoledronate in the non-affected skeleton as well as a dose reduction study to determine the minimum effective treatment for lysis inhibition.",
