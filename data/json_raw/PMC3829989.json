Recently C. tinctorius lignans arctigenin and trachelogenin but not matairesinol were described to interfere with the activity of tryptophan-degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. We examined a potential direct influence of compounds on IDO enzyme activity applying computational calculations based on 3D geometry of the compounds. The interaction pattern analysis and force field-based minimization was performed within LigandScout 3.03, the docking simulation with MOE 2011.10 using the X-ray crystal structure of IDO. Results confirm the possibility of an intense interaction of arctigenin and trachelogenin with the binding site of the enzyme, while matairesinol had no such effect.",

            "text": "The herbaceous Asteraceae plant Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to promote circulation and menstruation [ 1 ] and to treat neuropsychological disorders such as major depression [ 2 ]. In the Mediterranean area, C. tinctorius extracts play a role in the treatment of cancer and are known for antihelmintic, antiseptic, diuretic and febrifugal properties [ 3 ]. Most of the clinical conditions mentioned are associated with immune activation and inflammation which is characterized by specific biochemical alterations. Among them alterations of tryptophan metabolism appear to be most prominent. Tryptophan breakdown due to enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is involved in several physiological and pathophysiological conditions. IDO is an iso-enzyme of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), and both enzymes catalyze the first and rate limiting step of tryptophan catabolism namely the conversion of tryptophan to N -formyl kynurenine. Whereas TDO is mainly located in the liver, IDO is more widely distributed in the organism [ 4 ]. During immune activation and inflammation IDO is mainly up-regulated by Th1-type cytokine interferon\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), and this is detectable locally and systemically by an increased tryptophan breakdown rate as is indicated by an increased kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (Kyn / Trp) [ 5 ], whereas in healthy conditions, the expression and activity of IDO is low. In animal model systems and in vitro , increased tryptophan breakdown was found to lead to immune tolerance via the induction of regulatory T-cells (Treg) and dendritic cells [ 6 , 7 ].",

Arctigenin and also trachelogenin exerted a significant and dose-dependent effect to suppress tryptophan breakdown in the PBMC model, whereas matairesinol was only weakly effective [ 12 ]. Because of the relatively strong effect of compounds on tryptophan breakdown, we became interested to simulate possible direct interaction of the lignans with IDO, so a docking simulation was performed.",

A pharmacophore of the metal binding feature was generated within LigandScout 3.03 [ 17 ] based on the ligand (4-phenyl-imidazole) cocrystallized in the crystal structure and used as a constraint in the docking simulation. This means that the docked ligand must form a coordinated interaction with the heme iron ion from the IDO active site. For the docking, the A chain of 2d0t, which was crystallized as a dimer, was used. The original ligand 4-phenyl-imidazole, the two co-crystallized detergent molecules of 2-[ N -cyclohexylamino]ethane sulfonic acid, and water were removed. The binding site of the original ligand was chosen for the docking. The program defines the open space in the binding pocket with so called alpha spheres that represent available atom positions. Placement was done by the triangle matcher algorithm using standard settings. The triangle matcher algorithm generates poses by aligning triplets of ligand atoms with triplets of alpha spheres to find possible binding orientations of the ligand within the binding site.",

This pose was stabilized by two hydrogen bonds to Ser235 and Cys129 on each side of the molecule.

Thereby it is of particular interest to note that the dose-dependent suppressive effects which were observed in the in vitro test system of human PBMC were quite similar to the results of the calculations: also in PBMC arctigenin had the strongest influence on IDO activity followed by trachelogenin whereas matairesinol had no relevant effect.

Any effect of arctigenin and possibly also of trachelogenin to directly inhibit IDO activity would have several therapeutic consequences for antidepressant and immunomodulatory treatment strategies.

In most cases the suppression of tryptophan breakdown can be referred to an effect of compounds on IDO expression when the production of proinflammatory cytokines like IFN\u03b3 becomes diminished. Therefore in most studies also parallel suppression of neopterin production is demonstrable. From a structural perspective the lactone moiety can been observed in some other IDO inhibitory compounds, like warfarin, coumarin and garvin B [ 23 ]. The lignan scaffold itself was (to our knowledge and recent literature search) not known to act on IDO previously.",
