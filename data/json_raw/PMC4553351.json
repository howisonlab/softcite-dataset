The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features, radiologic findings, and treatment outcomes in patients of facial nerve paralysis with chronic ear infections. And we also aimed to evaluate for radiologic sensitivities on facial canal, labyrinth and cranial fossa dehiscences in middle ear cholesteatomas. Methods. A total of 13 patients were enrolled in this study. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for clinical features, radiologic findings, surgical findings, and recovery course. In addition, retrospective review of temporal bone computed tomography (CT) and operative records in 254 middle ear cholesteatoma patients were also performed. Results. Of the 13 patients, eight had cholesteatomas in the middle ear, while two patients exhibited external auditory canal cholesteatomas. Chronic suppurative otitis media, petrous apex cholesteatoma and tuberculous otitis media were also observed in some patients. The prevalence of facial paralysis in middle ear cholesteatoma patients was 3.5%. The most common involved site of the facial nerve was the tympanic segment. Labyrinthine fistulas and destruction of cranial bases were more frequently observed in facial paralysis patients than nonfacial paralysis patients. The radiologic sensitivity for facial canal dehiscence was 91%. The surgical outcomes for facial paralysis were relatively satisfactory in all patients except in two patients who had petrous apex cholesteatoma and requiring conservative management. Conclusion. Facial paralyses associated with chronic ear infections were observed in more advanced lesions and the surgical outcomes for facial paralysis were relatively satisfactory. Facial canal dehiscences can be anticipated preoperatively with high resolution CTs."

            "text": "Complications from chronic ear infections are decreasing because of earlier diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatments. However, chronic ear infections can still cause many intracranial and extracranial complications [1][2][3][4][5]. Among these complications, facial nerve paralysis is a potentially serious complication because it can result in facial asymmetry. In the litera-ture, the incidences of facial paralysis were reported to range from 1%-3% in patients with chronic otitis media [6][7][8]. Facial nerve paralysis was frequently observed in cholesteatoma patients and in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma [6,[8][9][10][11]. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical features, radiologic findings, and treatment outcomes in patients of facial nerve paralysis with chronic ear infections. And we also aimed to evaluate for radiologic sensitivities on facial canal, labyrinth and cranial fossa dehiscences in middle ear cholesteatomas. Our study includes a retrospective review of 13 patients with facial paralysis secondary to chronic ear infections. In addition, temporal bone computed tomographys (CTs) and operative reports of 254 cholesteatoma patients were reviewed to investigate for radiologic evidence of any fallopian canal, bony labyrinth and/or cranial base dehiscences.",

The duration of facial paralysis until surgery varied from 1 to 6 days except in two cases with complete paralysis. Many of the patients had a long history of ear disease. The onsets of facial nerve paralysis were sudden in 11 patients and gradual in one patient. Onset of paralysis was unknown in one patient who presented with complete paralysis. All patients presented with otorrhea and hearing loss, with five presenting with total deafness. Other frequently associated symptoms included otalgia in 10 patients and dizziness in four patients. The patient with petrous apex cholesteatoma also displayed signs of meningitis, but there were no other combined intracranial complications in other patients. The initial grades of facial paralysis according to the House-Brackmann grading system were II in one patient, III in nine patients, IV in one patient, and VI in two patients (Table 1).",

There were two patients that showed canal defects in both tympanic and mastoid segments. Two patients with complete facial paralysis showed that wide segments of the facial nerve were involved. Combined bony defects in the tegmen tympani were observed in eight patients, and three of them also revealed the defects in the posterior cranial fossa. Destruction of bony labyrinths was observed in six patients in the lateral semicircular canal, and there was one patient who had destruction of all semicircular canals and vestibules (Fig. 2). Four patients with bony labyrinth destruction showed total deafness during audiogram testing. Surgical interventions were performed as early as possible using the transmastoid approach in 12 patients except in one patient who had complete facial paralysis requiring conservative management. Among 12 patients, nine patients underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy, two patients underwent intact canal wall mastoidectomy, and one patient with a petrous apex cholesteatoma underwent a subtotal petrosectomy. Total removal of the cholesteatoma lesions or granulation tissues around the facial nerve was performed. The one patient with a petrous apex cholesteatoma underwent a subtotal petrosectomy without facial nerve repair. Only limited bony wall decompression was performed around the dehiscent area and incision of the epineural sheath was not performed in all surgical cases. Exposed facial nerves were covered by temporal muscle fascia.

It is generally surrounded by bony structures but can be exposed during the ossification process developmentally, during trauma,  during otologic surgery and in inflammatory diseases such as otitis media and cholesteatoma. In the medical literature, the incidence of facial canal dehiscence was reported to be between 20%-74% in temporal bone studies [12][13][14]. The most common location of dehiscence is known to be the tympanic segment of the fallopian canal because it is located in the floor of middle ear and has very thin bony coverage. The tympanic part of the fallopian canal developed anteroposteriorly from the geniculate fossa to enclose the facial nerve embryologically. Incomplete closure of facial sulcus could lead to congenital bony defects of the tympanic segment [15].",

According to Quaranta and colleagues, only 1.2% of more than 1,400 cholesteatomas showed facial paralysis and others reported less than approximately 3% of chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma [6][7][8][16][17][18]. In our series, 3.5% of cholesteatoma patients revealed facial paralysis and it was observed in around 1% of chronic infectious ear disease that underwent ear surgery.

Chronic suppurative otitis media and tuberculous otitis media were also observed. Although 52% of middle ear cholesteatoma patients exhibited facial canal dehiscences, only 6.8% of patients revealed facial paralysis. This result indicates that the facial nerve has a relatively high resistance to infection. Although there were no significant size differences in facial canal dehiscence between facial paralysis patients and nonparalysis patients, combined bony labyrinth destructions and cranial base defects were more frequently observed in facial paralysis patients. According to Ikeda et al. [16], 56% of facial paralysis patients with cholesteatoma had bony labyrinth destruction and 63% of those patients had cranial base destruction [16]. Those result coincided well with our results. In our series, 67% of facial paralysis patients with middle ear cholesteatoma showed bony labyrinth destruction and 78% of those patients also had cranial base destruction.

            "text": "The precise etiology of facial paralysis in chronic ear infection is not well known, but the direct inflammatory involvement of the facial nerve through fallopian canal dehiscence and compression resulting from edema is believed to be the involved pathophysiology. Some believe that the cholesteatoma itself could cause facial paralysis through neurotoxic substances that it might secrete and or cause bony destruction via various enzymatic activities [9,19]. There was also a histopathological study showing degenerative and inflammatory changes of the facial nerve in patients with facial paralysis due to chronic suppurative otitis media [20] Sometimes it may be difficult to visualize the facial canal dehiscence by temporal bone CT because the bone surrounding the tympanic segment can be very thin and soft tissue lesions such as a cholesteatoma or granulation tissues may be adjacent to the facial canal. However, diagnoses preoperatively can be more easily attained with high resolution CT, with its radiological sensitivity for facial canal dehiscence reported to be approximately 66% [21]. In our series, the radiologic sensitivity of facial canal dehiscence was approximately 91% with a specificity of 86%. These results reveal that preoperative high resolution CT is a useful diagnostic tool for facial canal dehiscence.",

Some authors postulated that a neural sheath incision should be performed for cases of complete paralysis, while there was reporting bony decompression from the geniculate ganglion to the stylomastoid foramen [8,22]. We did not perform any wide decompressions, with only limited bony decompressions around the dehiscences completed. None of the procedures had a neural sheath incision performed. All cholesteatomas and granulation tissues could be dissected relatively easily from the facial nerve under magnified view of the microscope. We thought that those infectious conditions should be regarded as different with other facial paralysis condition such as temporal bone fracture and idiopathic facial paralysis. We felt that the neural sheath might not only be a powerful barrier itself from infection, but that incision of the neural sheath could induce further nerve injury and possibly make the site more vulnerable for infection.",

The most common pathology involved a cholesteatoma affecting the middle ear, external auditory canal, and petrous apex. Tuberculous otitis media and noncholesteatomatous suppurative otitis media could also be the cause for facial paralysis. The prevalence of facial paralysis was about 1% in chronic ear infections and 3.5% in middle ear cholesteatomas. The tympanic segment was the most frequently affected location and patients with facial paralysis had more frequent destructions involving the bony labyrinth and cranial base. Facial canal dehiscences were observed in 52% of middle ear cholesteatoma patients. The radiologic sensitivity of facial canal dehiscence was 91% and careful preoperative examination will be helpful to anticipate the facial nerve exposure during surgery and the surgical outcomes for facial paralysis were relatively satisfactory."
