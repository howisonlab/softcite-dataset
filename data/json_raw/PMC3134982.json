Implants: Twenty TiAl6V4 rods (\u00d8 0.8 mm, length 10 mm) implanted in rat tibiae Methods: 10 rats underwent bilateral tibial implantation of titanium rods. At eight weeks, the animals were sacrificed and tibiae harvested for biomechanical testing. Eight tibiae were frozen and stored at-20\u00b0C for 14 days, the remaining eight were evaluated immediately post-harvest. Pull-out tests were used to determine maximum force and interfacial shear strength. Results: There were no significant differences between fresh and those of the frozen-thawed group in maximum force or in interfacial shear strength. Conclusion: Frozen Storage of rat tibiae containing implants at-20\u00b0 C has no effects on the biomechanical properties of Bone/ Implant interface.",

            "text": "Orthopaedic and Dental implants rely on osseointegration to achieve mechanical fixation to the host bone, which is a prerequisite for a good clinical outcome [1,2]. In the past, various approaches have been used to enhance peri-implant bone formation. Hydroxyapatite coatings [3], in combination with growth factors [4,5], bisphosphonates [6] or biomimetic surfaces [7] have been shown to improve osseointegration of titanium implants. Traditionally, large animal models have been used to study orthopaedic and dental implant fixation [5,[8][9][10]. More recently, rat models have generated an increased interest [6,11,12]. Molecular studies are easy to perform, care and handling of rodents is more manageable and overall costs are reduced. In the rat model a tibial or femoral implant is frequently used to assess osseointegration. The conditions and procedures for all parts of the trial, e. g. anaesthesia, implantation procedures [13], storage of tissue samples and mechanical testing must be defined and replicated at each stage.",

A medial incision to expose the knee joint in both hind limbs was made 5 mm longitudinally, and a pilot hole was marked at the intercondylar eminence.

Usually, mechanical properties of whole bone in 4-point bending tests [20,21,23,24] or of bone slices in compression tests [18,19] and indentations tests [19] are evaluated. Almost all of these studies have found no significant difference between fresh and frozen samples on mechanical testing [18-21, 23, 24]. Given the large difference in linear thermal expansion coefficients between fresh bone (89 \u00b1 2 x 10 -6/ K) [25] and titanium (8.5 x 10 -6/ K) [26], we hypothesized that a significant difference may exist between fresh and frozenthawed samples in mechanical testing of bone/implantinterfaces. Fig. (2). Mechanical pull out tests: The implant was fixed via a three jaw drill chuck to the testing system. We utilized an in vivo tibial implant model in rats to analyze the osseointegration of titanium alloy implants. The intramedullary implants are fixed by de novo bone formation. This thin bone/implant-interface, which had developed over the eight weeks, may be more susceptible to effects of tissue preservation.",
