This new method takes advantage of the X-ray structural information of the PDE-4 enzyme to characterize the small molecule inhibitors. It calculates molecular descriptors based on the matching of their pharmacophore feature pairs with those (the reference) of the target binding pocket. Since the reference is derived from the X-ray crystal structures of the target under study, these descriptors are target-specific and easy to interpret. We have analyzed 35 indole derivative-based PDE-4 inhibitors where Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis has been employed to obtain the predictive models. Compared to traditional QSAR methods such as CoMFA and CoMSIA, our models are more robust and predictive measured by statistics for both the training and test sets of molecules. Our method can also identify critical pharmacophore features that are responsible for the inhibitory potency of the small molecules. Thus, this structure-based QSAR method affords both descriptive and predictive models for phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors. The success of this study has also laid a solid foundation for systematic QSAR modeling of the PDE family of enzymes, which will ultimately contribute to chemical genomics research and drug discovery targeting the PDE enzymes."

PDE-4 selectively hydrolyzes cAMP and has been mostly targeted for the treatment of inflammation, and in particular chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) [5]. However, selective phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors have been demonstrated recently as novel agents to treat memory deficit [8] and neurodegeneration [9]. Preclinical studies indicate that these PDE-4 inhibitors can counteract deficits in long-term memory caused by pharmacological agents, aging or overexpression of mutant forms of human amyloid precursor proteins [9]. Although a number of major advances have been made with respect to PDE-4 inhibition, most of the PDE-4 inhibitors have unacceptable side effects, particularly nausea and emesis [10,11]. Thus, it is critically important to understand the structural determinants of potent and selective PDE-4 inhibitors, so that we can rationally design new molecules that minimize the undesirable side effects.",

Many investigators have tried to understand the structural basis for PDE-4 inhibition (both potency and selectivity) by constructing 3D QSAR (quantitative structureactivity relationship) models based on known PDE-4 inhibitors [12][13][14][15][16]. Even though these models provided preliminary pharmacophoric insights into PDE-4 inhibitors, the absence of the 3D structure of the target enzyme (i.e., PDE-4) in these models poses a major limitation on the reliability and interpretability of these models.

            "text": "This dataset covers a variety of molecules with various levels of inhibitory activities against PDE-4. Fig. (1) shows the activity distribution of the 35 indole derivatives. To develop and rigorously validate a QSAR model, 28 molecules were selected as the training set, and the remaining 7 molecules were held out as the test set. The specific selection of the training and test sets was determined by either randomly splitting or clustering-based splitting of the original dataset. The 3D conformations of all the inhibitors were generated using the OMEGA 2.0 program available from OpenEye Scientific (OMEGA 2.0, OE Scientific, NM, USA). In this study, only the best conformer of each molecule was used to generate the pharmacophore points. Fig. (2) depicts the overall work flow of the structurebased QSAR method employed in this study. The novel aspect of this method is the way by which it generates the molecular descriptors by the SB-PPK (Structure-based Pharmacophore Key) program. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D mo-lecular descriptor generation methods where ONLY the structural information of the inhibitor molecules is used to characterize the molecules, the SB-PPK program uses the structural information of the target binding site to measure the inhibitor molecules. Thus, target-specific molecular descriptors are generated, which reflects not only the inhibitor molecules but also the way these molecules interact with the binding site of the target. The general process of SB-PPK involves: 1) extraction of pharmacophore features from the target binding site; 2) perception of pharmacophore features of small molecules; and 3) generation of the structure-based pharmacophore key (SB-PPK) descriptors. Specifically, it derives the pharmacophoric centers from the 3D structure of a protein-ligand (R-L) complex, and uses them to generate the pharmacophore reference. It then generates structurebased pharmacophore key (SB-PPK) descriptors for the inhibitor molecules based on their pharmacophoric matching patterns with the above reference. Once molecular descriptors are generated, PLS (Partial Least Square) method is employed to establish the relationship between these molecular descriptors and the activity of the inhibitors. Details of the individual steps are described as follows. ",

The pharmacophore feature types used in this study include hydrogen bond donor (D), hydrogen bond acceptor (A), positively charged (P), negatively charged (N), and lipophilic (L) centers. Pharmacophore feature pairs are then generated by making all possible pair-wise combinations of the above pharmacophore centers. A specific pharmacophore feature pair is determined by both the feature types involved and the distance between the two centers. For example, AL in Fig. (3a) indicates a hydrogen bond acceptor (A) and lipophilic (L) feature pair; and the distance between them is 4.5 . Another example, AP, means a hydrogen bond acceptor (A) and a positive (P) feature pair and their inter-feature distance is 3.8",

Rational splitting of the dataset into training and test sets as well as obtaining the statistics for both the training set and test sets is critical in this model validation protocol. Thus, a given dataset is split into multiple pairs of training and test sets. Both random shuffling and clustering-based [27] splitting of the data set can be used for dataset partitioning. In the random shuffling approach, the first 7 molecules were held out as the test set after the order of molecules in the data set was randomly shuffled. In the clustering-based partitioning approach, the dataset was split in such a way that both the training set (28 molecules) and the test set (7 molecules) had the most coverage of the clusters. For each split, PLS was used to analyze the training set in order to build a PLS regression model. Regression coeffi-cients were then calculated for both the training set (r 2 ) and the test set (R 2 ). While the former reflects the model quality as measured on the training set, the latter (R 2 ) is a more robust indicator of the predictive power of the model. In the end, only those model(s) with both coefficients greater than set thresholds are retained as the final model(s). Fig. (4). Workflow for rigorous validation of QSAR models.",

The conventional correlation coefficient r 2 obtained for the training set monotonically increases while the predictive R 2 obtained for the testing set reaches a plateau before it starts to decrease. When the number of principle components (PC) is less than 3, the resulting QSAR models are not predictive for either the training set or the test set. When the number of principle components is over 8, the predictive ability for the test set starts to go down. This indicates potential over-training at higher number of principle components. According to our model validation protocol (Fig. 4), the models with the number of principle components between 5 and 8 are predictive for both the training and the test sets. The best models should be a trade-off between conventional r 2 and the predictive R 2 .

            "text": "To build high quality, predictive QSAR models, we systematically performed dataset splitting into training and test sets using both random shuffling and clustering-based splitting methods. For each partitioning approach, we obtained ten different training/test sets, and built 90 different QSAR models with the number of principal components ranging from 2 to 10. Of all 180 QSAR models, the conventional correlation coefficient r 2 ranges from 0.69 to 0.89, and the predictive R 2 values range from 0.05 to 0.75. The splitting which renders the highest r 2 and R 2 for corresponding models with number of principle components between 5 and 8 is selected as the partitioning of training and test sets to build the final QSAR models. Fig. (8a) and Fig. (8b) show the predictive quality of the best QSAR models for PDE-4 inhibitors built with the SB-PPK descriptors and PLS method. Table 3 present the comparison between our best models with those of other methods. We have compared the results obtained with CoMFA [15], CoMSIA [15], 2D QSAR (using MOE package) and SB-PPK (our own method). All methods use PLS as the modeling tool with number of principle components set at 6. Both CoMFA and CoMSIA afforded highly predictive models based on the training set; however, the predictive R 2 for the test set are both significantly lower than that for the training set. Our method, on the other hand, afforded much more balanced predictive quality, for both the training set and the test set. Thus, based on the reported correlation coefficients (for both training and test sets), we believe our method (SB-PPK plus the specific workflow process) afforded the best model both in terms of predictive ability for the training set and, more importantly, in terms of the predictive power on the test set.",

Fig. (9a) shows that descriptor LL1, AL12, AA6, AA1 and AL2 are relatively important in the QSAR models. These descriptors correspond to the pharmacophore feature pairs depicted in Fig.  (9b). Thus, the SB-PPK descriptor based QSAR analysis can reveal critical features that correspond to the pharmacophore features of the target binding pocket.

This new QSAR formalism describes molecular structures based on the matching of their pharmacophore feature pairs with those (the reference) of the target binding pocket. This reference is derived from the Xray crystal structures of the target under study. Thus, these descriptors are target-specific and easy to interpret. The PLS (partial least square) method is then employed to reveal the correlation between these target-specific descriptors and the biological activity, and help identify the critical pharmacophore features for PDE-4 inhibition."

Consequently, our models display highly balanced predictive ability for both the training and the test sets ( Table 3). In contrast, CoMFA and CoMSIA models have shown signs of over fitting, with high r 2 for the training set but much lower R 2 for the test set. Thus, this model validation protocol based on both training and test set statistics is critical for the success of this study.",
