            "text": "Normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) surrounding WMHs is associated with decreased structural integrity and perfusion, increased risk of WMH growth, and is referred to as the WMH penumbra. Studies comparing structural and cerebral blood flow (CBF) penumbras within the same individuals are lacking, however, and would facilitate our understanding of mechanisms resulting in WM damage. This study aimed to compare both CBF and structural WMH penumbras in non-demented aging. Eighty-two elderly volunteers underwent 3T-MRI including fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), pulsed arterial spin labeling and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). A NAWM layer mask was generated for periventricular and deep WMHs. Mean CBF, DTI-fractional anisotropy (DTI-FA), DTI-mean diffusivity (DTI-MD) and FLAIR intensity for WMHs and its corresponding NAWM layer masks were computed and compared against its mean within total brain NAWM using mixed effects models. For both periventricular and deep WMHs, DTI-FA, DTI-MD and FLAIR intensity changes extended 2-9 mm surrounding WMHs (p 0.05), while CBF changes extended 13-14 mm (p 0.05). The CBF penumbra is more extensive than structural penumbras in relation to WMHs and includes WM tissue both with and without microstructural changes. Findings implicate CBF as a potential target for the prevention of both micro and macro structural WM damage."

            "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2-weighted white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are commonly observed in aging brains, grow over time [1][2][3][4] and are associated with cognitive decline, [5][6][7][8][9][10] motor impairment, 8 stroke, 6,11,12 and mortality. 6 White matter hyperintensity (WMH) is characterized pathologically by demyelination, axonal loss, and rarefaction, 13 often attributed to vascular ischemia, [14][15][16][17] and associated with arteriolosclerosis. 4 It has been related to cerebral hypoperfusion or blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. 13,[18][19][20] Altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) and white matter (WM) integrity in WMHs has been widely reported. [21][22][23][24][25][26][27] There is increasing interest in the physiological changes not only within visible WM lesions but also in the surrounding normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), referred to as the WMH penumbra. This area demonstrates similar MRI characteristics as WM lesions, but to a lesser degree, and is at risk for further damage over time. 26 Previous studies have characterized WMH penumbras using either cerebral perfusion or structural changes. The WMH structural integrity penumbras defined by diffusion tensor imaging-fractional anisotropic (DTI-FA) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) intensity were approximately 3-8 mm around WMHs. 26,27 Others have similarly demonstrated low DTI-FA and high DTI-mean diffusivity (DTI-MD) in the NAWM immediately surrounding WMHs. 24 These findings demonstrating the presence of microstructural degeneration surrounding WMH lesions implicate visually observed white matter damage as being indicative of a much larger region of tissue disturbance. Longitudinal studies have further validated cross-sectional findings that altered DTI-FA and FLAIR signal in the tissue surrounding NAWM at baseline predict incident WMHs at follow-up. 28,29 Pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL) can quantify white matter (WM) and WMH CBF, which is comparable with what has been reported in others using different perfusion imaging techniques. 25,[30][31][32] A previous report from our laboratory has shown that lower ASL CBF in the NAWM surrounding WMH lesions extends approximately 12 mm from both periventricular (PVWMH) and deep WMHs (DWMH). This is more extensive compared with previously reported structural penumbras, defined by DTI and FLAIR data, suggesting that altered CBF may be a primary contributor to the formation of T2-weighted MRI WM lesions. Similar to structural WMH penumbras, the CBF penumbra has also been demonstrated to be associated with expansion of WMH lesions over time. 21,25 Studies comparing both structural and CBF penumbras within the same individuals are lacking. While structural penumbra identification provides insight into the full scope of microstructural white matter integrity disruption associated with WMHs, it does not clearly provide insight into its etiology. The CBF penumbra may provide insight into the etiological mechanisms underlying visible MRI WM lesion formation, but, in isolation, does not impart critical information regarding the degree of subtle microstructural WM integrity disruption surrounding such lesions.",

Based on previous studies demonstrating the likelihood that a major component of WMHs is vascular in origin and that altered perfusion should precede the WM integrity changes, we, therefore, hypothesized that penumbra area defined by CBF would cover a more extensive area from the WMHs than the penumbras defined by structural integrity measures."

A custom cluster-growing algorithm was used to expand each cluster. To ensure the accuracy of the WMH detection, the WMH clusters were visually examined and manually corrected. Last, WMH clusters contiguous with the ventricles were labeled periventricular WMHs (PVWMHs) and all others were considered deep WMHs (DWMH). To derive the subject-specific CBF map, each of the three runs of PASL images was inspected, and data found to have excessive head movement (!2 mm or 2 degrees) were discarded, and the three runs were concatenated. Quantitative CBF was then calculated on a voxel basis according to Wang et al. 37 Voxel-wise partial volume correction was performed. 38 DTI analysis comprised of registering raw DTI images to correct for eddy current distortions and applying ''dtifit'' command, a FSL subroutine, 39,40,41 to reconstruct diffusion tensors, including FA and MD images.

We created 15 dummy variables indicating each NAWM layer with total brain NAWM as a reference. The difference in coefficients between two adjacent layers were compared to examine the plateau phase. There is a ''location effect'' of white matter association and commissural fibers surrounding the ventricles resulting in high DTI-FA in NAWM surrounding PVWMH compared with the mean NAWM DTI-FA of the entire brain. 24 Because of this anatomical phenomenon, the plateau phase of this data was determined by comparing adjacent data points using paired t-tests. The first of two neighboring layers whose values were not significantly different from each other was defined as the outer boundary for the PVWMH DTI-FA penumbra. Significant difference was set at p < 0.05. The analysis was performed for PVWMH and DWMHs separately.",

Longitudinal analysis of these data is being conducted to more definitively address this question. The findings of decreased CBF and DTI-FA and increased DTI-MD and FLAIR intensity within the WMH and its surrounding NAWM areas are consistent with several previous reports. 21,22,[25][26][27][28][29]42,43 The low blood flow in WMHs provides further evidence that age-related white matter injury is likely attributed to vascular ischemia, [14][15][16] caused by arteriolosclerosis, 4,44,45 chronic hemodynamic insufficiency contributed by watershed blood  supply in the area adjacent to the ventricles, [14][15][16] and/or impaired BBB permeability, which leads to decreased fractional blood volume and increased fluid in the vessel wall, accompanied formation of WM injury. 46 It is uncertain if the blood flow reduction is causing the brain tissue damage or if it is a secondary mechanism in response to diminished tissue to supply.",

            "text": "DTI findings of decreased FA and increased MD indicate the presence of compromised microstructural WM integrity and altered water mobility in the interstitial space within WM lesions and their surrounding NAWM. 47 Clinically, this deterioration may affect the integrity of white matter tracts connecting cortical and subcortical areas, leading to a disconnection syndrome and may attribute to age-related cognitive decline. 48 The degree of sensitivity of the different DTI parameters used to investigate the structural WMH penumbra was different between PVWMH and DWMHs. Previous work has indicated that MD provides better differentiation of WMH associated integrity disruption within NAWM than FA, showing more alteration in surrounding NAWM from the WMH. 24 Our result shows this to be the case only for PVWMH. It is not clear whether previous work investigated only PVWMH or combined WMH subtypes, which may be mostly comprised of PVWMH. Our results may imply that mean water diffusivity is more sensitive in detecting the extent of periventricular WM integrity disruption than FA, with the opposite being true for the DWMH. Anatomical differences may explain the varying DTI penumbra characteristics between PVWMHs and DWMHs. PVWMHs are located near highly organized myelinated structures, such as the corpus callosum, where water diffusion will be highly restricted and dependent on fiber direction. As our result demonstrated, unlike the other parameters, DTI-FA of the PV NAWM layers did not plateau at the total brain NAWM DTI-FA mean. Instead, DTI-FA values of the inner PV WMH NAWM layers plateaued at a value greater than the mean (Figure 4(c)). Meanwhile, the location of DWMHs is more sporadic, do not abut the ventricle, and therefore are not inherently susceptible to systematic anatomical influences on MRI WM integrity measures. Thus, the location-independent aspect of DWMHs makes them important targets, in addition to PVWMHs, in investigations studying the etiology of age-related WMHs.",

Studies to assess relationships between WMH penumbras and cognitive and motor performance would shed further insight into the clinical implications of age-related WM degeneration. Future study should also focus on the rate of WMH growth and whether the CBF penumbra can predict the rate of WM integrity changes. Last, future studies including methods to examine the relationships between BBB permeability, hypometabolism, and cerebral perfusion in the WMH penumbra are needed.",

Decreased CBF and DTI-FA and increased DTI-MD and FLAIR intensity of the NAWM surrounding WMHs indicates that the scope of WM injury extends beyond visible lesions commonly observed on clinical MRI. CBF penumbra is more extensive than the DTI WM integrity and FLAIR intensity penumbras, suggesting that ASL CBF may provide information regarding ''at risk'' tissue preceding the occurrence of microstructural WM integrity disruption. Given these findings, the WMH CBF penumbra should be considered as a potentially modifiable biomarker in future studies aimed at preventing vascular cognitive impairment in the elderly."
