            "text": "Purpose: Korean red ginseng (KRG) is a potent antioxidant and a free radical scavenger. This study was designed to determine whether KRG could protect against dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by torsion-detorsion injury in rat testis. Materials and Methods: Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: a sham-operated control group (C), a sham-operated and KRG-treated group (K), a 2 hours torsion and detorsion group (T), and a 2 hours torsion and detorsion and KRG-treated group (T\uff0bK). We measured testis weight and hormone levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the left renal vein. Superoxide generation was measured on the basis of lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence in testis tissue. Results: Testicular weight was significantly higher in the T\uff0bK group than in the T group; however, there were no significant differences in hormone levels between the 4 groups. The mean level of ROS and superoxide production was significantly higher in the T group than in the C group, whereas administration of KRG attenuated this increase. Upon histologic evaluation, the T group was found to have cellular disarray, a lack of cellular cohesiveness, degenerative changes in the germinal cells, and less distinct changes in the seminiferous tubules, whereas the T\uff0bK group had a germinal epithelial layer that appeared nearly normal. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that KRG recovered the testis dysfunction in the rat testis by suppressing superoxide production."

            "text": "Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency. The testicular salvage rate following surgical detorsion has been reported to range from 42% to 88% [1,2], but it is unclear whether these testes were actually saved with respect to testicular spermatogenic function [3]. A testis injury produced by reperfusion can be more severe than that induced by ischemia [4]. This is because the reperfusion component typically involves the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the return of blood flow following a period of ischemia [5]. Panax ginseng (P. ginseng) C. A. Mayer has been used for thousands of years in Asia due to its wide spectrum of medicinal effects. This compound has a wide range of pharmacologic and physiologic actions, such as anti-aging, immunoenhancement, anti-stress, and anti-tumor activity [6][7][8]. It has long been known that P. ginseng has protective properties against free radical attack [9][10][11]. Indeed, P. ginseng administration to rats has been shown to prevent myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) damage induced by hyperbaric oxygen [11]. Protective effects of P. ginseng against hepatic oxidative stress induced by exhaustive exercise and against skeletal muscle injury caused by oxidative stress induced by acute exercise have also been reported [12,13]. Among the currently available P. ginseng products, Korean red ginseng (KRG, Ginseng Radix Rubra) has the most potent multiple pharmacologic actions for anticancer, antihypertension, antidiabetes, and anti-nociception effects and for improving weak body conditions [14]. Recently, KRG was also found to possess anti-stress and antioxidant activities [15]. Although KRG has been investigated for multiple purposes, its effect on I-R injury of the testes during testicular torsion and detorsion has not yet been evaluated. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of KRG on testicular damage in a rat testicular I-R injury model.",

The sham-operated group was used as the baseline group. All animals underwent an adaptation period of 1 week in cages under normal conditions before the surgical procedure. At the age of 7 weeks, the C and K groups underwent a sham operation and the T and T\uff0bK groups underwent testicular torsion followed by detorsion. The C and T groups were fed tap water, whereas the K and T\uff0bK groups were fed water with KRG for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the rats were anesthetized and the left testes were removed. After the testes were removed, they were dissected to remove the fat tissue and blood vessels, after which the tunica albuginea was eliminated. The testis was then weighed and longitudinally bisected. Half of the testes were immediately stored in organ baths to determine the superoxide level, whereas the remainder were fixed in Bouin's solution for histological examination. Fresh heparinized blood samples from the left renal vein were also obtained to assess the antioxidant enzyme, ROS, and hormonal levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone. The remainder of the testis was stored at \u221270 o C for biochemical assay."

All operations were conducted under sterile conditions. Throughout the anesthesia, body temperature was maintained by using a heating pad. In the sham-operated group, the left testis was removed through a midscrotal vertical incision. A 5-0 silk suture was then placed through the tunica albuginea, the left testis was placed into the scrotum, and the incision was closed. In the torsion and detorsion group, the left testis was exposed through the same incision. The left testis was rotated 720 o in a counterclockwise direction and maintained in this torsion position by fixing the testis to the scrotum with a 5-0 silk suture.

            "text": "Testicular torsion is the twisting of the spermatic cord, which cuts off the blood supply to the testicle and surrounding structures within the scrotum. Testicular torsion is a very common surgical emergency [18]. If surgery is performed within hours, most testicles can be saved, although there is an increased risk of decreased sperm production and fertility and atrophy of the testis [19,20]. Testicular torsion-detorsion is an I-R injury to the testis. In this study, we evaluated KRG treatment to determine whether it could protect the testis from injury associated with testicular torsion and detorsion. To accomplish this, we measured the superoxide level of the I-R damaged testis tissue with and without KRG treatment. This study is the first report to evaluate the effects of KRG, a potent an-tioxidant, on the formation of ROS in rat testis due to I-R injury. The results of the study demonstrated that KRG recovered the testis dysfunction caused by ischemia and subsequent reperfusion in the rat testis by suppressing superoxide production.",

Kitts et al reported that North American ginseng extract exhibits effective antioxidant activity in both lipid and aqueous media via the chelation of metal ions and scavenging of free radicals [24]. Kim et al reported that red ginseng aqueous extract had free radical scavenging activity [25]. Indeed, red ginseng extracts are known to scavenge hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. P. ginseng has been shown to have a remarkable capacity to protect brain tissue proteins from oxidative damage in vitro [26]. Furthermore, the crude saponin fraction of KRG was found to abrogate the generation of NADPH-driven superoxide in rats [15]. Overall, the aforementioned studies indicate that KRG is a useful adjuvant for the protection of I-R-induced oxidative injury. Therefore, it is likely that KRG also has protective effects against I-R-induced oxidative injury of the testis, which was confirmed in the present study.",

I-R injury is associated with the over-generation of ROS, such as hypochlorous acid, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radicals [3]. ROS cause damage to DNA and impair the protein function and peroxidation of lipids. Lipid peroxides rupture the membranes and cause structural and functional alterations in the testis. Reperfusion of the ischemic tissue promotes the generation of ROS, which arises from activation of the xanthine oxidase system in parenchymal cells or from leukocytes penetrating into interstitial tissue. These substances have destructive effects on various cellular functions and lead to increased microvascular permeability, interstitial edema, impaired vasoregulation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and parenchymal cell dysfunction and necrosis. Therefore, ROS may directly damage the seminiferous tubules in the testis. Free radical reduction for the treatment of I-R injury has been found to prevent post-ischemic testis dysfunction [27].",

Increases in FORT values most likely indicate an increase in the oxidation of lipids, which occurs in lipid bilayers and lipid particles [28]. This oxidative marker also reflects specific cel-lular oxidation events. Abramson et al suggested that oxidative stress, as measured by the free radical oxygen test, may be a determinant of C-reactive protein levels and promote pro-atherosclerotic inflammatory processes [29]. In the present study, the correlation between FORT and the acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein was evaluated and a significant positive correlation was found. Increasing FORT values also indicate inflammatory processes. I-R led to increased oxidative stress in the testis, but KRG had a protective effect against the oxidation of lipid bilayers and inflammatory processes.",
