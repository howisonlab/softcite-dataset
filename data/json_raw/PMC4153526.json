            "text": "Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is recommended as a promising technique for the management of the primary generalized dystonia (PGD) with DYT1 gene mutation. We present the first report of DBS results in Iranian patients with DYT1 positive PGD. Methods: Nine patients who suffered from severely disabling DYT1 positive PGD consecutively were recruited for the study between 2008 and 2010. The patients underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation of the GPi in a single procedure. The mean follow up duration was 8.8 \u00b1 2.2 months. The efficacy of the intervention was evaluated by comparing pre-and post operative scores of patients with Burke-Fahn-Marsden's dystonia Scale (BFMDS). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 11.0 software. Results: Of 9 patients six were female with the mean age of 15.2 \u00b1 5.5 years old (range: 8-25 years old). The mean for Burke-Fahn-Marsden's Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) score was 47.22 \u00b1 14.1 before surgery and 12.3 \u00b1 8.2 after follow up, which significantly improved (P=0.0001).The mean stimulation parameters at the last visit were at a frequency of 152.2 \u00b1 32.4 Hz (range 130-230 Hz), a voltage of 2.6 \u00b1 0.7 V (range 1.1-4), and a pulse width of 60 \u03bcsec. No complication was observed during follow up. Conclusion: Bilateral DBS of the GPi has an encouraging result for the management of DYT1 positive PGD and is recommended as a safe technique for the treatment of these patients. Shorter pulse width in stimulation parameters is suggested for DYT1 dystonia patients."

            "text": "Primary generalized dystonia (PGD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by involuntary, prolonged muscle contractions and abnormal twisting postures in young adults (1). The most frequent cause of early onset primary dystonia is an autosomal dominant disease due to mutation in DYT1 gene locus on chromosome 9q34, which encodes for an abnormal torsin A protein (2,3).Since pharmacotherapy usually has a limited efficacy in suppressing the disease progression, surgical approaches have been considered for the treatment of severe forms of PGD (4). Pallidotomy improves the symptoms, but it has severe side effects (5). Unilateral pallidotomy cannot adequately resolve generalized symptoms, and bilateral pallidotomy may cause serious complications such as cognitive impairment, dysarthria, dysphagia, and limb weakness (5,6). Other surgical tech-nique is a bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) by implanting electrodes in the Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi) which is particularly recommended for patients with DYT1positive dystonia (4,7).",

A frequency of 130 Hz is associated with the best clinical improvement in the patients. Higher voltage is also related to significant improvement of clinical symptoms (18). However, due to the risk of delivering excessive charge to the brain and decreasing battery life, voltage may have gradual decline (19). Most of recent studies used stimulation frequencies of 100 to 185 Hz (5,15,19). In our study, frequency and amplitude setting was similar to other studies.",

Among stimulation parameters, the pulse width setting in our patients was unique and considerably shorter than similar studies. The pulse width equal to 60 \u03bcsec besides a high frequency (150 Hz) had a reasonable clinical response in the patients. This setting has at least two prominent advantages for the patients: shorter pulse width could extend battery life and it may decrease the side effects. Regarding the tolerability of the setting and good clinical response in the patients, it is advisable to use pulse width of 60 \u03bcsec in DYT1 positive dytonia patients. Similar to other studies, we used deepest electrodes more commonly in our patients (15,18,19).",

In Borggrafe's study, adverse events occurred in 50% of patients and 13% of them underwent another surgery (14). Cubes reported one case of delayed unilateral infection of IPG after DBS which leaded to system removal (4). Hardware malfunction, including extension of cable disconnection and early IPG dysfunction, in addition to hardware infection were also observed in another study (15). Nonetheless, increasing rigidity, more cramping and development of diaphoresis were reported 4 years after DBS which led to revision of surgery to resolve symptoms (2). Despite these findings, we observed no complication among our study subjects. One probable cause of this difference could be our short term follow up of patients. This was a limitation in the present study which also made the durability of response to DBS in our DYT1 patients unclear. However, initial therapeutic response was favorable.",
