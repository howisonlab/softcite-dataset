            "text": "Background: Many patients suffering from trichotillomania (TTM) have never undergone treatment. Without treatment, TTM often presents with a chronic course. Characteristics of TTM individuals who have never been treated (untreated) remain largely unknown. Whether treatment history impacts Internet-based interventions has not yet been investigated. We aimed to answer whether Internet-based interventions can reach untreated individuals and whether treatment history is associated with certain characteristics and impacts on the outcome of an Internet-based intervention. Methods: We provided Internet-based interventions. Subjects were characterized at three time points using the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire. Results: Of 105 individuals, 34 were untreated. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was markedly impaired in untreated and treated individuals. Symptom severity did not differ between untreated and treated individuals. Nontreatment was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (P=0.002). Treatment history demonstrated no impact on the outcome of Internetbased interventions. Conclusion: Results demonstrate that Internet-based interventions can reach untreated TTM individuals. They show that untreated individuals benefit as much as treated individuals from such interventions. Future Internet-based interventions should focus on how to best reach/ support untreated individuals with TTM. Additionally, future studies may examine whether Internet-based interventions can reach and help untreated individuals suffering from other psychiatric disorders.",

            "text": "2 ). TTM is associated with significant distress and functional impairment (criterion C, DSM 5), and patients' attempts of reducing hairpulling are usually unsuccessful (criterion B, DSM 5). Most frequent locations of hairpulling are the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes. 3 Affected individuals tend to avoid group activities because they are worried about their appearance and that others may uncover their problem. 4,5 Approximately 86% of TTM individuals report a reduced quality of close friendships. 6 Additionally, TTM often interferes with work performance and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), 3,7 and it is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, mood, eating, 8,9 and personality disorders. 10 Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), including habit reversal training (HRT), 11 progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), 12 acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), 13 and decoupling (DC), 14,15 are effective treatments for TTM. However, individuals with TTM often report feelings of embarrassment and shame that have been shown to be significant barriers for them to access and seek treatment. 3,7,8,16 Therefore, in adult individuals with TTM, the estimated prevalence of treatment is only \u223c50%. 3 Treatment often begins \u223c9 years after the onset of hairpulling. 17 In addition to embarrassment and shamefulness, further possible reasons for nontreatment may include failure to recognize symptoms as a treatable problem and not knowing where to seek professional help. 18 Without proper treatment, TTM almost always leads to a chronic and often debilitating course. 19 Very few studies have investigated individual or illnessspecific characteristics, differentiating between individuals with and without previous treatment. In patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, studies have found no significant associations between gender and treatment history. [20][21][22] Results on age and treatment history in obsessive compulsive disorder studies have been inconsistent. [23][24][25] Whether individual characteristics (eg, age), illness characteristics (eg, severity of hairpulling), and/or impairment of HRQoL are associated with treatment history of TTM individuals is not yet known. Thus, learning more about the similarities and differences in the characteristics of treated and untreated TTM individuals may guide researchers and clinicians to find individualized approaches to access and support those who have never been treated or identified through the conventional therapeutic network. One approach to support untreated individuals may be via Internet/mobile-based interventions. 26,27 However, whether such interventions can access and benefit untreated individuals compared to previously treated individuals has never yet been investigated. Thus, the present study has mainly focused on the following hypotheses:",

The inclusion criteria were adult individuals who met the diagnostic criteria for TTM according to DSM-IV-TR. 28 Exclusion criteria were current suicidal ideations, dependency of alcohol or drugs, and/or current psychotic episodes. Other comorbid AXIS I disorders were assessed but were not considered as exclusion criteria due to the known high rate of psychiatric comorbidity in TTM. Individuals were excluded if they discontinued the pretreatment assessment (n=20). An additional 16 individuals were excluded because they were interested in the study but did not meet criteria for TTM (n=4), they could not be contacted for the telephone interview (n=6), they decided not to take part in the interview (n=1), and they met the exclusion criteria (four individuals with current suicidal ideations, one with current alcohol dependency; flow chart, Figure 1). With regard to treatment history, individuals were asked if they have ever received professional help (such as psychiatric, psychotherapeutic, and/or psychopharmacological treatment) and/or if they were currently treated for any mental health problem. This assessment did not refer to the specific and targeted treatment for TTM since we aimed to also include additional TTM-related mental health problems (such as depressive symptoms) in the study. Individuals who answered \"no\" for both questions were assigned to the \"never-treated/untreated\" group (N=34). If one or both questions were answered affirmatively, individuals were assigned to the \"previously treated/treated\" group (N=71).",

To test whether treatment history potentially affects the outcome of Internet-based intervention, an intention-totreat analysis (ITT) with first observations carried forward (FOCF) and a completer's analysis were conducted. In both analyses, a general linear model with repeated measures (GLM-RM) and repeated contrasts was conducted for the dependent variables (MGH-HPS, HDRS-17, WHOQOL-bref subscores [not WHO environment], and SCL-K-9). Group (treatment history: untreated vs previously treated) served as the between-subject variable, and time (pre, post, follow-up) as the within-subject factor. A significant impact of treatment history can be seen in a significant interaction between group and time. Variables (baseline HDRS-17 and baseline WHOglobal) that had demonstrated baseline differences between both groups (untreated/previously treated) were included as covariates into the analyses, also the variable intervention group (decoupling/PMR). Assumptions for all analyses with GLM-RM were checked in terms of Box's test of equality of covariance matrices, Mauchly's test of sphericity, and Levene's test of equality of error variances. All assumptions were met, with the exception of a significant Box's test for the HDRS-17 and a significant Mauchly's test for the GSI (ITT and completers' analysis), which was considered with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction. Effect sizes (partial \u03b7 2 ) were calculated (\ue0240.01 small effect, \ue0240.06 medium effect, and \ue0240.14 large effect size). 41 All statistical calculations were performed using the software package SPSS (Version 22.0).

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing clinical characteristics between untreated and previously treated individuals suffering from TTM and examining the potential effect of treatment history on the outcome of an Internet-based intervention. Both untreated and previously treated individuals with TTM demonstrated marked impairment in HRQoL compared with the general population. TTM individuals who have never received any previous treatment had significantly lower depressive symptoms, in addition to having significantly more hairpulling from other body areas      except from the scalp. Interestingly, treatment history did not affect the outcome of the Internet-based intervention and dropout rates did not differ between untreated and previously treated individuals. Before a detailed discussion of the present study, we would like to acknowledge several limitations. One of the main limitations of our study is that the majority of individuals were female. Therefore, it would be imprudent to apply our current results to males. However, previous TTM online studies have reported similar female predominance in their study sample. 3,16 Whether this reflects TTM as having a higher prevalence in females 1,42 or females with greater information-or help-seeking behavior 43 remains an important but yet unsolved question. 11,44 Although 32.4% of participants of the current sample were untreated individuals, this number appears to be considerably lower than the number of individuals not receiving treatment in the community and in other published epidemiological studies (\u223c50%, eg, the study of Woods et al 3 ). One reason for this discrepancy might be due to the assessment history. We inquired about the general psychiatric treatment history and did not explicitly seek treatment history specific to TTM. We also did not ask the participants about their reasons for not receiving any treatment. For those who have received treatment, we also did not inquire whether their treatment was perceived as helpful. In addition, we cannot exclude recall bias by participants who might have had difficulties to accurately recall therapy experiences from the past.",

Overall, both patient groups reported longstanding symptoms and considerable impairment of HRQoL. Nevertheless, global HRQoL and depressive symptoms were less severe in untreated individuals compared to those who have previously sought treatment. While these results implied that certain untreated individuals might not have sought treatment before due to a relatively lower functional impairment, severity of hairpulling, duration of hairpulling symptoms, and global severity did not differ between the groups. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the number of psychiatric comorbid disorders, and all participants were motivated enough to seek help in the current intervention study, indicating substantial amount of suffering in both groups of TTM participants (treated and untreated).",

For instance, lower depression scores have been reported in patients with social phobia who sought treatment for the first time compared to those with prior treatment history. 47 Among psychiatric patients, interference with daily living due to depressive symptoms is one of the major motivations for individuals to seek professional treatment. 20,23,48,49 3) Physicians are often more familiar and knowledgeable to manage depressive symptoms 50,51 than hairpulling symptoms, 44,52 this in turn may allow individuals to disclose their depressive symptoms more willingly to their physicians. Thus, individuals with more severe depressive symptoms may be identified and provided treatment more often than those who have fewer depressive symptoms. Taken together, 1) feeling less shameful to disclose depressive symptoms than hairpulling symptoms, 2) the negative impact of depressive symptoms as a significant motivation for individuals to disclose their symptoms and seek help, and 3) the higher rate of identifying individuals with more severe depressive symptoms might explain the association between depressive symptoms and previous treatment history.",

            "text": "In the following section, we would like to discuss possible reasons that may explain the present findings. 1) Even though TTM individuals with a previous treatment history might have benefited from their previous treatment, they did not report less hairpulling severity but instead reported more severe depressive symptoms at baseline than individuals without any prior treatment. Depressive symptoms have been shown consistently to be associated with cognitive impairments, 53 and these symptoms could impair learning and the application of new adaptive behaviors. However, the severity level of depression in both samples was relatively low and did not reach diagnostic thresholds for a current depressive episode in most individuals. 54 This might explain why potential cognitive effects of depression did not affect treatment outcome in this study. 2) While some studies reported that individuals with previous treatment are more likely to dropout from current therapies, 55 the dropout rates did not differ between our studied groups. This finding is supported by the abovementioned study in patients suffering from social phobia 47 -prior treatment was not associated with a change in dropout rates. A potential reason might be that prior treatment was less successful and/or less specific for TTM symptoms, and therefore, individuals attempting our new Internet-based intervention might be more motivated and desperate to complete the whole treatment program in order to learn new skills for reducing their TTM symptoms. 3) One might assume that individuals without previous treatment might, due to limited skills of reducing TTM symptoms compared with individuals with prior treatment, benefit to a lesser extent. However, previous treatment(s) might not be as comprehensive or successful, which might not have provided an additive improvement to our current Internet-based intervention(s). When interpreting our findings, it is important to keep in mind that the data were gathered and assessed via the Internet. Participants without previous treatment indeed sought help in our Internet-based intervention study. These individuals were actively searching for information and help related to TTM online; therefore, they might have at least some insights into their problems. Overall, the present study provided encouraging results and demonstrated that it is possible to access at least some of the \"hidden\" untreated individuals and that professional online information/ intervention might be important to successfully close the gap between being ill, having insight into symptoms and/or mental illness, seeking professional help, 56 and benefiting from the provided Internet-based intervention(s).",
