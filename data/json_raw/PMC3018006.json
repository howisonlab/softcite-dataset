TSLIM is an optimized version of a light-sheet fluorescent microscope that previously used a start/stop scanning procedure to move the specimen through the thinnest portion of a light-sheet and stitched the image columns together to produce a well-focused composite image. In this paper, hardware and software enhancements to TSLIM are described that allow for dual sided, dual illumination lasers, and continuous scanning of the specimen using either a full-frame CCD camera and a TDI line scan camera. These enhancements provided a ~70% reduction in the time required for composite image generation and a ~63% reduction in photobleaching of the specimen compared to the start/stop procedure.",

            "text": "A thin-sheet laser imaging microscope (TSLIM) is a device for nondestructive optical sectioning of organisms and thick tissues such as the mouse cochlea, zebrafish brain/inner ear and rat brain [1]. TSLIM is a modular device that can image transparent tissues such as zebrafish embryos or fixed and cleared transparent tissues that have been labeled with a fluorochrome. It is similar to other light sheet based microscopes in which specimens are illuminated by a light-sheet, and fluorescent tissue planes are recorded by a camera that is mounted orthogonal to the light-sheet. By moving in the z-axis, serial optical sections are obtained and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of structures can be generated for visualization and morphometry. However, since the light sheet is thinnest only in a narrow region (i.e., the beam waist) an x-axis scanning procedure was used to produce a well-focused composite image across the full width of the specimen. The original description of TSLIM [1] used a single green laser and a full-frame CCD camera in which the center 40 lines of the CCD array were collected using a start/stop procedure and an x-axis composite image was produced by stitching these image columns together. The present report describes hardware and software solutions that increase image quality and speed of optical sectioning, which also reduces photobleaching of the specimen. The use of a TDI line scan camera and our software and hardware features can also be used for other light-sheet based microscopes to reduce scanning times and specimen photobleaching.",

It is technologically a relatively simple procedure whereby a thin sheet of light illuminates a plane in a transparent volume and that plane, or optical section, is observed orthogonal to the light-sheet. It has been used to image organisms in a plane of water [5] but its most common application is to optically section thick tissues that have been labeled with a fluorochrome and made chemically transparent. Light-sheet microscopes have been developed by a number of different investigators [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] and this technology is rapidly evolving. TSLIM [1] was developed by optimizing components of previous light-sheet microscopes and this report describes software and hardware enhancements to TSLIM that significantly improve its capabilities. Specifically, TSLIM now features a line scan camera in addition to the full-frame CCD camera, hardware triggering of the cameras, and software that allows for continuous scanning of the image in the x-axis.",

In the present version of TSLIM a green solid-state laser with a wavelength of 532-nm (Optotronics, VAI50532) is used to produce a light-sheet and their light path is shown in Fig. 1. The laser beam is expanded and collimated using a 10X Galilean beam expander (Edmund Optics, NT55-579) and passed through, an f = 50.8 mm cylindrical lens (Newport CKX525-C). The light-sheet is rotated 90 degrees by passing through the image side of an NA = 0.14 EO infinity-corrected long working distance 5X Plan Apochromat microscopic objective (Edmund Optics, NT59-876). The light-sheet is projected through the side of an open top, glass or quartz specimen chamber (Starna, 3G20; DLC300Q20). The specimen is attached to a Delrin\u00ae (DuPont) rod that is suspended in the center of the chamber which contains either a clearing solution for fixed and cleared specimens or an aqueous solution for live specimen imaging. The illuminated plane within the tissue specimen is observed perpendicular to the light-sheet using either a 1X or 2X objective lens (NA = 0.25, NA = 0.50) on a horizontally mounted, Olympus micro MVX10 microscope. Images are captured using either a full-frame CCD digital camera (Retiga 2000R) or a TDI line scan camera (Dalsa, Piranha HS-40-04K40). Fig. 1. Top-view and side-view of TSLIM's light-sheet pathway. A solid state laser beam is converted in an optical assembly (beam expander, cylindrical lens and microscope objective) and passes through the specimen chamber containing the tissue. The thinnest portion of the light-sheet is at focal point of the microscope objective. The illuminated plane in the tissue is collected by a microscope objective and recorded using a digital camera.

However, in the x-and zaxes, Newport's computer guided ESP301 motion controller in combination with Newport's LTA-HS closed loop servomotors (with a typical bi-directional repeatability of 0.6 \u00b5m and velocity of 5 mm/s) are used to position the specimen. A LabVIEW program coordinates image acquisition and motor positioning simultaneously. The image acquisition routine consists of grabbing a column of image data from the camera and moving the specimen the width of that column and then collecting another column. These columns are stitched together to form a composite image across the full width of the specimen. Figure 2(a) shows the ROI (i.e., the confocal paramater) in an image of the mouse cochlea. The Rayleigh range x R was calculated [1] with the 5X Plan Apo microscopic objective to approximately 34 \u00b5m and thus the confocal parameter b is 68 \u00b5m. To the left and the right of the ROI, the image appears out-of-focus due to greater beam thickness and light scattering. In addition, a blur is present in the lower left of the image, which is due to the presence of a high density structure (i.e. bone) in the cochlea that lies between the optical section and collecting lens of the Olympus microscope. However, Fig  In order to produce a stitched image without columns artifacts like shown in Fig. 2(c), it is crucial to find a relationship between the moved distance m (\u00b5m) and the strip width w ROI (pixel). Since the magnification M of the microscope is the factor between its image and the original, it is also the major parameter in the relationship between m and w ROI . But because m is defined in \u00b5m and w ROI in pixels, the correction factor p, defined as the pixel size of the camera, is also included in Eq. (1).",

To produce a picture of 1200 pixels with 40 pixels per column, it takes ~60 seconds and 30 cycles of starting/stopping the servomotor to produce a composite image using a 15mW green laser. To optically section a whole mouse cochlea with approximate dimensions of 2 x 1.5 mm it took up to 5 hrs and 350 images with a 5 \u00b5m z-step size (distance between the pictures in zdirection). A consequence of this prolonged light exposure is a loss of fluorescence intensity in the specimen, i.e, photobleaching. This effect is increased by subsequent sections of the specimen that are exposed to the beam before being collected since the unfocused area of the beam is significantly larger than the z-step size. Our previous measurements indicated a loss of approximately 8.85% in fluorescence intensity to complete one composite image [1]. Although the effect is much less than wide-field or confocal microscopy it is detrimental and decreases the signal to noise ratio, contrast, and picture quality.",

The latter is due to a difference between the acquired slice width of 40 pixels (59.2 \u00b5m) and the distance moved by the motor, which exceeds the size of one pixel. Hence the ROI needs to include overlapping pixels to minimize the stitching artifacts. However, that procedure requires a significant image processing and the overlapping pixels are still visible in the final image. That is why the strip width w ROI has to be reduced in order to reduce the influence of that distance and improve the image acquisition. This strategy will also reduce the effect of the misalignment of the pixel array of the camera chip to the moving direction, which makes it even more crucial to consider this requirement for an improvement of the image acquisition. A similar optimization strategy for improving the image quality by reducing the strip width w ROI was previously described by Buytaert and Dirckx [8].",

But the advantage of more pixels can also be used to increase the magnification by a factor of ~2.5 X compared to the Retiga 2000R image. The resolution with the Dalsa camera increases while maintaining the same field of view as the Retiga 2000R. This is demonstrated in Fig. 4ab using a raw, unprocessed image of Claudius cells/basilar membrane taken from a low power image of the entire cochlea at a 5X magnification with the Retiga 2000R in Fig. 4(a) compared with a 10X magnification and the Dalsa in Fig. 4(b) (magnification increased by the factor of 2 leads to a comparable picture size). According to Eq. (1) we achieved a higher resolution and a lower confocal parameter limit of 11.2 \u00b5m with that system, compared to 59.2 \u00b5m for the Retiga, including a pixel size p = 7 \u00b5m for the Dalsa camera. Thus the confocal parameter limit was reduced to a significantly smaller confocal parameter than with a regular CCD camera while not only retaining but increasing the scanning speed. Fig. 4. Comparison between full frame (a) and line scan camera (b) with a higher magnification. Due to increased resolution by the line scan camera the image can be enlarged more without showing pixelation.

Combined with the technology of the TDI mode, it takes approximately 5 sec to scan a full-frame, high resolution image (4096x3000 pixels) of the entire cochlea with a 10x zoom and 32 integrations without any blur adjustments. That is not only significantly faster than the HROPFOS [8] scan but it also allows for greater enlargement of the image without pixelation.",

            "text": "Due to a decrease in the time that it takes to collect a composite image by continuous scanning, photobleaching of the fluorochrome within a specimen should also be reduced. To test that hypothesis, three 100 pixel square, similar homogenous regions (i.e., compact bone) within the mouse cochlea (prepared as described in previous publication [1]) at three different z-stack locations were imaged repeatedly for 50 times and the intensity measured after each composite was produced by the three methods described in this paper (start/stop, continuous CCD scan, and continuous line scan). Figure 5 shows that generation of 50 composite images that took 1550, 750, and 475 sec for each method respectively and fluorescence intensity was retained by 65, 80, 87% respectively. Thus, the line scan camera provided a ~70% reduction in the time required for composite image generation and a ~63% reduction (35%-13%/35%). in photobleaching of the specimen. Fig. 5. Photobleaching of a specimen following 50 repeated imaging of the same plane of an optical section. The start/stop procedure using the CCD camera takes 1550 sec to image 50 sections and retains 65% of the fluorescence. A continuous scan using the CCD takes only 750 sec and retains 80% of the fluorescence. A continuous scan with the line scan camera takes only 475 sec and retains 87% of the fluorescence making it the best choice for TSLIM imaging.",

            "text": "As far as we know this is the first description of the implementation of a line scan camera with the TDI technology for light-sheet microscopy. The Dalsa camera is well suited for imaging fluorescent specimens using scanned, thin-sheet laser microscopy. The TDI mode of the camera offers high sensitivity and sophisticated imaging technology to not only provide high resolution and low noise images, but also a fast scanning speed. This leads to a more efficient collection of the fluorescence and less photobleaching of the specimen. In the area mode, it also allows for alignment of the specimen and localization of the confocal region within the optical section. TSLIM has been enhanced with hardware and software additions that provide for high quality, rapid scans of large tissues such as the mouse cochlea. Due to the increased number of pixels in the line scan camera it is possible to image larger specimens within a single frame and to discriminate fine details in smaller specimens thanks to higher pixel density. This is important when one wants to contain the full height and width of a tissue or specimen within one picture of an image stack. In addition, TSLIM also allows us to decrease the beam waist and confocal parameter (above a limit of 11.2\u00b5m) and thus reveal",
