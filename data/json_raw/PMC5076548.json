Nutrition and particularly antioxidants could help to fight against skin degradation. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an oral supplement rich in specific antioxidants, SkinAx 2TM , on the improvement of the skin radiance in women. Methods: The open-label clinical study enrolled 35 women, aged 40-70, with facial dull complexion. Subjects were supplemented orally with a daily dosage of 150 mg of an antioxidant-rich formulation containing superoxide dismutase-rich melon concentrate, grape seed extract rich in monomers of flavanols, vitamin C, and zinc for 8 weeks. Each subject served as her own control. The C.L.B.T. \u2122 test has been used to evaluate facial skin coloring (C), luminosity (L), brightness (B), and transparency (T) involved in skin radiance. Facial skin imperfections have been assessed by clinical assessment. Firmness has been evaluated by clinical assessment and cutometer measurement. Finally, an auto-questionnaire has been carried out in order to evaluate the satisfaction of the subjects concerning different parameters involved in skin radiance and the global efficacy of the supplement. Results: Skin \"red pink\" and \"olive\" colors were significantly improved after supplementation (P<0.0001). Luminosity was increased by 25.9% (P<0.0001) whereas brightness and transparency were not affected by the supplementation. Facial skin imperfections were significantly reduced after the antioxidant-rich formulation intake (global reduction:-18.0%; P<0.0001). Indeed, dark circles, redness, and spots significantly diminished after oral treatment. Firmness and elasticity have been shown to be improved. Subjects were globally satisfied by the product (82.4%) and have found improvements on their facial skin. Furthermore, 64.7% reported to look better at the end of the supplementation. Conclusion: The oral supplement containing the antioxidant-rich formulation was found to improve skin radiance by reducing skin coloring, increasing face luminosity, reducing imperfections, and improving skin firmness in women with dull complexion.",

Indeed, skin protects the body from the outside which means from physical, chemical, and infectious attacks and plays a role in several biological and biochemical processes. 1 Visible skin appearance is an important moderator in human social interaction. It facilitates nonverbal communication. Humans attach great importance to a beautiful, healthy, and youthful-looking skin. Partly conveyed by the cosmetic industry, skin beauty includes a radiant complexion without imperfections. 2 There is no universal definition of skin radiance. The radiance of the complexion is multifactorial and it is difficult to list all the parameters that constitute it with their relative proportions. [3][4][5] The main characteristics are the skin contrast defined by the luminosity, brightness, and transparency; the skin color, mainly affected by the skin microcirculation; and the skin imperfections such as the homogeneity, dark circles, or spots. 3,4,6 The skin radiance is influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors which can modulate skin aging. [7][8][9][10] While the intrinsic aging is inevitable, extrinsic aging is the result of the interplay of external factors and human behaviors, such as tobacco, nutritional deficiencies, alcohol, stress, and ultraviolet (UV) exposure. Both of these factors impact the oxidative stress by an overproduction of reactive oxygen species. 7,9,10 Thus, with aging, the skin is potentially more exposed to oxidative stress, leading to exacerbated reactive oxygen species production. [11][12][13] This overproduction of free radicals, which plays an important role in skin aging, damages skin cells and in addition leads to a degradation of collagen and elastin. These fibers are responsible for the skin firmness and elasticity and the vessels integrity, and hence for the good skin vascularization. 9,10,14 Moreover, cell degradation and UV exposure will lead to a heterogeneous overproduction of melanin by melanocytes, which leads to facial spots and a heterogeneous complexion. 15 As the first line of cell defense against oxidative stress, primary antioxidants correspond to the endogenous system comprised of the only three antioxidant enzymes of the body: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. These enzymes contain trace elements in their active sites, such as copper, zinc, and selenium, supplied by food and essential for their enzymatic activity. 16 To avoid such cellular damages, a reduction of the amount of secondary oxidants is the complementary step to lower the oxidative stress. This occurs firstly by enhancing the synthesis of primary antioxidants and secondly by lowering their spreading thanks to secondary antioxidants. Secondary antioxidants, as the second level of antioxidant protection, also called scavengers, correspond to exogenous substances, including hydrosoluble antioxidants (vitamin C, glutathione, and polyphenols) and liposoluble antioxidants (vitamin E, carotenoids, and bilirubin), which allow the diminution of the amplification loop of skin cell damage. 11 Thus, nutrition and particularly dietary antioxidant active ingredients could help to protect skin from aging. First, they can act against the oxidative stress and secondly some of them are able to impact specific biological mechanisms enhancing the skin protection and repair.",

Skin  brightness corresponds to the uniformity of the skin in terms of coloring and texture. Skin transparency is the possibility of seeing the vessels beneath the skin reflecting the level of vascularization and the skin thickness. The evaluation of luminosity, brightness, and transparency has been performed visually using a scale ranging the parameters from \"no intensity\" (limit 0) to \"maximum\" (limit 10). In this way, L.B.T. parameters have been interpreted as follows: luminosity should increase (from dark skin to luminous skin); brightness should increase, when low, to have a more uniform and regular skin, or should decrease, when high, to have a balanced shiny skin; and transparency should increase if low to have a more transparent skin, thinner, and well vascularized or should decrease when high to avoid seeing too many vessels under the skin (Table 1). Facial skin imperfections have been evaluated through a clinical scoring reporting the color and relief of dark circles, redness/rosacea (color and surface), presence of spots (color and quantity), and heterogeneity of the skin imperfections.

The firmness evaluation was scored from \"Absent/Light\" to \"Moderate/ Important\" by an examiner. The cutometer measures the elasticity of the skin in vivo by a suction test. A probe of 6 mm diameter is applied to the skin and a temporary vacuum is created (400 mbars), thus deforming the skin (on time: 3 seconds; off time: 2 seconds; repetition: 5). Adhesive tape is attached to the probe and prevents the adjacent skin from being sucked into the chamber. The device holds a spring ensuring a constant application pressure (50 g/cm\u00b2). An optical system made of a light source and a receptor determines the skin deformation and its slackness. Different parameters are measured: immediate deformation Ue (U extensibility), delayed deformation Uv (U viscous), final deformation Uf (Uf = Ue + Uv), and deformation of immediate retraction Ur, when the vacuum is removed. The ratio Ur/Ue characterizes the elasticity of the skin and is independent of the thickness of the skin. 18 ",

Moreover, they play an important role in the vessels integrity and thus in the skin vascularization. 9,10,14 Furthermore, cell degradation and UV exposure results in a heterogeneous overproduction of melanin by melanocytes, which can cause the appearance of facial spots and a heterogeneous complexion. 15 Our results suggest a positive effect of oral supplementation rich in primary and secondary antioxidants on skin radiance.

            "text": "According to several authors, the skin radiance appears to be the combination of the light reflection within the skin (luminosity and brightness), level of skin imperfections, and skin color. 3,4,6 Complemented by appropriate techniques, sensory evaluation seems to be a good method to appreciate skin radiance as a whole. The skin aging process is influenced by genetic and environmental factors with consequent impact on the oxidative secondarily with the flavanol monomers from grape, vitamin C, and zinc. 16,19,20 Monomers of flavanols have been chosen instead of polymers because they are more bioavailable. Indeed, studies have shown that flavanol polymerization limits absorption in the gut. 21,22 Furthermore, a potential synergistic effect between vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and flavanol monomers has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. This synergistic effect has been observed on antioxidant capacities with catechin alone or in the presence of ascorbic acid. 23 The authors suggested that the higher radical-scavenging ability can be due to a regeneration process of catechin radical by ascorbic acid. Another synergistic potential has been confirmed in vivo where it has been shown that flavanols improved the vitamin C bioavailability. 24 The improvement of the firmness and the elasticity suggests that elastic fibers have been protected by the supplementation. Indeed, the firmness of the skin is mainly linked to collagen and elastin, which confer stability to the dermis and its elastic properties. 9 Furthermore, improvement of skin firmness also allows reduction of dark circles. The generation of reactive oxygen species, in particular by UV radiation, induces the production of collagenase and elastase, responsible for collagen and elastin degradation. Vitamin C stimulates collagen synthesis, acting as a cofactor in the hydroxylation of proline and lysine, essential amino acids in the formation of collagen fibers. 25,26 Flavanols, and in particular monomers, inhibit the degradation of collagen and elastin by fixation on fibers, which reduce the action of collagenase and elastase. Moreover, flavanols are known to stimulate the synthesis of amino acids precursors of collagen and elastin. [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38] This action on skin elastic fibers has a direct impact on the vascularization system acting on the capillary resistance. This effect on skin circulation has been observed through the skin color improvement after supplementation as the main pigments responsible for the different hues are melanin, bilirubin, and hemoglobin. 17 The reductions of redness/ rosacea and dark circles color are linked with these impacts on vascularization. Moreover, the vascularization improvement is also possible through the vasodilation and blood flow. First, it allows improving the nutrient circulation, and it is important for the bioavailability of the product. Blood flow also participates in the skin hydration. Thus, flavanol monomers from grape and SOD are known to improve the vasodilation increasing the nitroso species production. [39][40][41][42][43][44] A regulation of the age-related heterogeneous overproduction of melanin has been observed in particular with the reduction of facial spots. The improvement of skin color also reflects this impact as one of the main pigments responsible for skin hue is the melanin. 17 Flavanol monomers and vitamin C are known to reduce the tyrosinase activity necessary for the melanogenesis and, thus, they are able to regulate the melanin synthesis. 15,[45][46][47] The term \"radiance\" often refers to the shining and lightening aspect. Interestingly, in our study, luminosity, linking with the global skin color and skin homogeneity, was improved. However, a radiant complexion seems to be associated with several skin characteristics reflecting the physical and psychological health. 4,48 Thus, radiance evaluation remains at least in part subjective. The final auto-assessment of several parameters involved in skin radiance contributes to bringing more information concerning the effects of the oral supplementation. Tested women were satisfied concerning different specific points, such as their skin radiance, skin luminosity, or its hydration. They were also globally satisfied by the product, up to 82.4%. Finally, they felt they looked better after the supplementation.",
