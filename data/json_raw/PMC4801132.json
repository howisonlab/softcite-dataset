            "text": "Bufei Jianpi formula (BJF) has long been used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of COPD. Systems pharmacology identified 145 active compounds and 175 potential targets of BJF in a previous study. Additionally, BJF was previously shown to effectively prevent COPD and its comorbidities, such as ventricular hypertrophy, by inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production, matrix metalloproteinases expression, and other cytokine production, in vivo. However, the system-level mechanism of BJF for the treatment of COPD is still unclear. The aim of this study was to gain insight into its system-level mechanisms by integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics together with systems pharmacology datasets. Using molecular function, pathway, and network analyses, the genes and proteins regulated in COPD rats and BJF-treated rats could be mainly attributed to oxidoreductase activity, antioxidant activity, focal adhesion, tight junction, or adherens junction. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of systems pharmacology, transcript, protein, and metabolite datasets is performed. The results showed that a number of genes, proteins, metabolites regulated in BJF-treated rats and potential target proteins of BJF were involved in lipid metabolism, cell junction, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response, which might be the system-level therapeutic mechanism of BJF treatment.",

            "text": "Bufei Jianpi formula (BJF), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has provided effective relief of symptoms in patients with COPD. Our clinical study demonstrated that BJF had extensive pharmacological effects on patients with COPD, such as alleviating the clinical symptoms of stable COPD, reducing the exacerbation frequency, delaying acute exacerbation, and improving pulmonary function and exercise capacity. 4 Increasing evidences demonstrate that, in treating complex illnesses, including COPD, treatment formula containing multiple drugs with distinct but related mechanisms can usually exert synergistic therapeutic effects and amplify the therapeutic efficacies of each agent. 5,6 In the previous study, we constructed a systems pharmacological model by combining active compound prediction, target prediction, and network pharmacology to clarify the active compounds and therapeutic mechanism of BJF. Systems pharmacology successfully identified 145 bioactive ingredients from BJF and predicted 175 potential targets of the active components contained in BJF. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrated that BJF was effective for the treatment of COPD and ventricular hypertrophy due to its inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cytokine, and hypertrophic factors expression, protease-antiprotease imbalance, and collagen deposition, in vivo. 7 Systems pharmacology, as an understanding of the function of the biological system, provided a systemwide view of the therapeutic mechanism of BJF in treating COPD rats. However, we should provide more experimental evidences to validate the systems pharmacology predictions at system level.",

[8][9][10] Transcriptomics has been used in many in vivo studies to find the whole genome, which, however, cannot provide the details of the alternative splicing or even protein expression itself. Proteomics is a promising approach to directly study the expressed proteins and protein functions in a cellular context. Moreover, metabolomics provides the metabolic information, that is, the consequence of the transcriptome and proteome. 11 Thus, comprehensive analyses of the transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics datasets have the potential to provide a system view of the complex biological processes and function of herbal compounds. 12 We previously analyzed metabolite changes in lung tissues of COPD rats, and identified 30 strongly regulated metabolites resulting from intervention by BJF treatment. 13 In this study, we further analyzed the molecular effect of BJF on COPD rats using the datasets of transcripts and proteins derived from lung tissues. Finally, the aim of this study was to integrate systems pharmacology, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data streams, which provided a system picture of molecular mechanisms of BJF in treating COPD rats.",

            "text": "As discussed earlier, we constructed a system-level picture of the therapeutic mechanism of BJF by integrating systems pharmacology, transcript, protein, and metabolite datasets. As shown in Figure 7, the systems pharmacology targets and three-omics data were integrated, and the comprehensive picture was mainly consisted of four groups: lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, cell junction, and oxidative stress. In the previous study, we found that the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were significantly decreased by BJF treatment. In addition, ERK, p38, JNK, and NF-\u03baB were the potential targets of BJF. 7 These results implied that BJF could achieve its ameliorative effect on COPD rats by suppressing inflammatory responses. In this study, upon BJF treatment, arachidonic acid metabolism and linoleic acid metabolism were the significant deregulated pathways in lung tissues. In these pathways, the level of lecithin, linoleate, 9-OXOODE, \u03b3-linolenate, LXA4, LTB4, and PGE2 were suppressed by BJF treatment. Moreover, these metabolites, such as LXA4, LTB4, PGE2, and PGF2\u03b1, were involved in inflammatory processes in the airways of patients with COPD. [22][23][24][25] In addition, according to the systems pharmacology predictions, ALOX5 PTGS1/2, LTA4H, and AKR1C3, the important enzymes involved in these deregulated pathways were the potential targets of BJF. Therefore, the results indicated that BJF achieved its anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing the lipid metabolism and the production of pre-inflammatory cytokines.     The inflammatory responses associated with COPD are believed to be triggered by oxidative stress. 26,27 In this study, we detected eleven overlapping proteins between the targets of BJF and proteomic measurements of BJF-treated rats, which were mainly involved in oxidative stress. 28 For instance, the antioxidant proteins such as SOD1 and GSTP1 were involved in the pathogenesis of COPD, [29][30][31] which were upregulated by BJF treatment. Additionally, increased myeloperoxidase levels are associated with rapid lung function decline. 32,33 In proteomic study, we found that the expression levels of myeloperoxidase were decreased by BJF treatment. These results suggested that BJF achieved its anti-inflammatory activity by regulating the oxidative stress status.",
