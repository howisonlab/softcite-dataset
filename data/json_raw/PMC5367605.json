            "text": "Computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery was born in the 1990s. Nowadays, computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery is used for transpedicular screw fixation and for total knee arthroplasty. Patient-specific instrumentation is one type of computerassisted surgery based on volumetric images, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. In this article, possible applications of patient-specific instruments in paediatric orthopaedics are described. The use of patient-specific instrumentation for the correction of cubitus varus is given as an example with complex osteotomy. Another application for tarsal coalition resection is shown. A last example of using patient-specific instrumentation for both tumour resection and allograft reconstruction is illustrated. Patient-specific instruments based on computed tomography of the bone can increase peri-operative accuracy and decrease operative time. They are very helpful for the surgeon. Other applications are possible and will be probably developed in the future."

Salako et al used guided intrapedicular screws to decrease the rate of misplaced screws. 11 Leiggener et al 12 manufactured a guide by additive manufacturing using selective laser sintering (SLS) for mandible reconstruction with free fibula osseous flap. They were able to perform a complex reconstruction by choosing the best position on the donor (fibula) and recipient (mandible) sites, avoiding important structures like dental nerve and respecting vascular anatomy.

CAOS helps the surgeon to more accurately pinpoint anatomical landmarks, and guides the surgeon through different bone cuts. Three main advantages of CAOS and PSIs have been found. PSIs have been widely tested to assess their accuracy and impact on time during the surgery. The early reported results on accuracy of PSIs were encouraging. Positioning measurements have shown angulation error below 0.6\u00b0 in the spine and the tibia and 1\u00b0 in the femur. 14 Cadaveric experiments showed clinically acceptable results in the spine 15 with few errors above 2 mm when compared with the conventional method. On the question of time, studies have shown a shorter duration of surgery by using PSIs in three different applications. This improvement is easily understandable because of the 'plug and play' characteristic of the instrument. The user places the instrument in the correct position and connects standard devices to achieve the desired task. A cadaveric experiment has demonstrated that PSIs decreased the time to find the entry point for drilling in a vertebra pedicle. 15 For triple pelvic osteotomies on actual patients, the whole surgery time decreased by 23%, to gain 35 minutes. 16 The decrease of intra-operative irradiation thanks to a lesser use of fluoroscopy is also an added value of the technology. It has been shown that it is significantly decreased when using PSIs. 17 In this report we will demonstrate the use of PSI technology in paediatric orthopaedics by describing three possible clinical applications.",

It occurs with an incidence of about 1% of the general population and is bilateral in 50% of cases. 8,20 Talocalcaneal and calcaneonavicular coalitions are the most frequent forms. It is a frequent cause of foot and ankle pain, with onset during the second decade of life or later. Subtalar motion (inversion and eversion) may be impaired and iterative ankle sprain, flat-foot and tarsal tunnel syndrome may occur. Diagnosis is given by radiograph for calcaneonavicular coalition (AP, oblique and lateral views) and by CT for talocalcaneal coalition. Surgery is indicated only in cases of symptomatic tarsal coalition resistant to conservative management. One favoured technique is triple arthrodesis (talocalcaneal, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid), but long-term follow-up has shown onset of secondary tibiotarsal osteoarthritis in 58% to 77% of cases. 21,22 An alternative method consists of resecting the synostosis, providing good results in terms of pain alleviation and prevention of osteoarthritis, 23,24 although not in all reports. It is not always straightforward during actual surgery to determine precise location and orientation of the saw blade for bone bridge resection, and it is also difficult to stop sawing before breaching the healthy talocalcaneal joint. Fluoroscopy is often not useful for talocalcaneal coalition. Arthroscopic resection has also been reported, 24,25 but involves a long learning curve, 26 longer operating time, 27 , risk of posterior tibial pedicle neurovascular lesion 28 and difficulty in positioning. 29",

However, several studies suggest that limb-salvage surgery increases the local recurrence, in cases of inadequate margin excision. 30 To achieve local control of the disease and improve oncological results, wide resection margins are mandatory. This wide surgical excision results in a large residual bone defect that needs restoration. By using PSI the width of the margins may be decreased. 7 The resection is carefully planned before surgery, based on MRI and CT scans that are used to define the trajectories of the resection. Limb reconstruction for such large defects can be performed by different techniques, including: endoprosthetic reconstruction, osteoarticular allograft, vascularised autograft, bone transport with distraction osteogenesis or reimplantation of the tumour-bearing bone segment after devitalisation of the tumour cells (by heating, freezing or extracorporeal irradiation). Massive bone allografts present some drawbacks, including relatively long rehabilitation due to immobilisation and partial weight-bearing, difficulties in obtaining size-matched allografts for small patients, the absence of expandability, and the relatively high incidence of complications. 31 Despite these drawbacks, allografts offer several advantages, including the ability to re-attach host ligamentous and tendinous structures to the graft. Others advantages are the biological incorporation of the graft (at least partially) and the preservation of the joint, the juxta-articular bone and the growth-plates. 32 These advantages make massive bone allografts convenient for intercalary, osteoarticular or arthrodesis operations, and for allograft-prosthetic composite reconstruction in an extra-articular resection. Bone allograft is the most common option for intercalary reconstruction, with survival rates as high as 75% to 89% at ten years. 31,33,34 ",

Once the optimal allograft is chosen, the CT-to-CT registration permits the transfer of the cutting planes of the tumour resection to the co-ordinate system of the allograft's CT (Fig. 13). This procedure ensures that the target planes for the patient and allograft are identical. In this case, the patient was 11 years old. The allograft, being harvested from an adult donor, was over-sized. It had been planned to cut the superior iliac crest to adjust its size and to be able to close the surgical approach (Fig. 13).
