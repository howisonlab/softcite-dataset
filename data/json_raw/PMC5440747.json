            "text": "Mitochondria are the main consumers of molecular O 2 in a cell as well as an abundant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both, molecular oxygen and ROS are powerful regulators of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1subunit (HIF-\u03b1). While a number of mechanisms in the oxygen-dependent HIF-\u03b1 regulation are quite well known, the view with respect to mitochondria is less clear. Several approaches using pharmacological or genetic tools targeting the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) indicated that ROS, mainly formed at the Rieske cluster of complex III of the ETC, are drivers of HIF-1\u03b1 activation. However, studies investigating non-ETC located mitochondrial defects and their effects on HIF-1\u03b1 regulation are scarce, if at all existing. Thus, in the present study we examined three cell lines with non-ETC mitochondrial defects and focused on HIF-1\u03b1 degradation and transcription, target gene expression, as well as ROS levels. We found that cells lacking the key enzyme 2-enoyl thioester reductase/mitochondrial enoyl-CoA reductase (MECR), and cells lacking manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) showed a reduced induction of HIF-1\u03b1 under long-term (20 h) hypoxia. By contrast, cells lacking the mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome channel protein Mpv17 displayed enhanced levels of HIF-1\u03b1 already under normoxic conditions. Further, we show that ROS do not exert a uniform pattern when mediating their effects on HIF-1\u03b1, although all mitochondrial defects in the used cell types increased ROS formation. Moreover, all defects caused a different HIF-1\u03b1 regulation via promoting HIF-1\u03b1 degradation as well as via changes in HIF-1\u03b1 transcription. Thereby, MECR-and MnSOD-deficient cells showed a reduction in HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels whereas the Mpv17 lacking cells displayed enhanced HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels under normoxia and hypoxia. Altogether, our study shows for the first time that mitochondrial defects which are not related to the ETC and Krebs cycle contribute differently to HIF-1\u03b1 regulation by affecting HIF-1\u03b1 degradation and HIF-1\u03b1 transcription where ROS play not a major role."

            "text": "Oxygen homeostasis is essential for survival and normal function of all aerobic living cells and organisms. Adaptation to low oxygen levels involves a wide range of responses at different cellular levels. Among the first line responses to hypoxia is the reprogramming of gene expression by activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs are heterodimers, containing an oxygen-dependent \u03b1-subunit (HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1 and HIF-3\u03b1) and a constitutively expressed \u03b2-subunit (HIF-1\u03b2 or aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) [1]. From the three \u03b1-subunits known to date, HIF-1\u03b1 is the best characterized. Its regulation occurs primarily at the level of protein stability; under normal oxygen tension HIF-1\u03b1 is hydroxylated at two specific residues (P402 and P564) which allows binding of a VHL-containing ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates degradation via the ubiquitin/ proteasome pathway [2,3]. The hydroxylation is carried out by a family of proline hydroxylases which are dependent on the availability of molecular oxygen, Fe 2+ and \u03b1-ketoglutarate [4]. Under low oxygen levels the HIF-1\u03b1-subunit is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus where it regulates more than 800 target genes [5,6]. Interestingly, the levels of HIF-\u03b1 subunits are not only affected by oxygen, but also by reactive oxygen species (ROS). One major source of ROS are mitochondria which are important organelles involved in a variety of cellular processes, including ATP production, calcium homeostasis, as well as cell survival and cell death [7,8].",

The OXPHOS machinery consists of five multi-subunit enzyme complexes (complex I, II, III, IV and V), which are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane [9]. The electrons generated in the TCA cycle and which are donated by the coenzymes, NADH and FADH2 are passing through the electron transport chain (ETC) where oxygen functions as a final acceptor. However, if oxygen does not become fully reduced to water, ROS are generated as a byproduct of this electron transport process [10]. Several reports using pharmacological or genetic approaches targeting the ETC indicated that ROS, mainly formed at the Rieske cluster of complex III of the ETC, are drivers of HIF-1\u03b1 activation [11][12][13][14][15][16]. However, the approaches targeting the ETC are expected not only to interfere with ROS production, but also to interfere with mitochondrial oxygen consumption and thus, make it difficult to estimate to which extent ROS production or as proposed a shift in oxygen distribution [17] accounts for the effects on HIF-1\u03b1.",

Therefore, we investigated in the present work three cell lines with such mitochondrial defects with respect to HIF-1\u03b1 regulation, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS production, and HIF target gene expression ( Fig. 1). The first cell line under study was devoid of 2-enoyl thioester reductase/mitochondrial enoyl-CoA reductase (MECR). MECR is a component of the fatty acid synthesis type II (FAS II) complex and catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of trans-2-enoyl thioesters. Loss-of-function mutations in the MECR gene cause childhood-onset dystonia and optic atrophy [18]. The second cell line used was lacking Mpv17, a mitochondrial inner membrane channel forming protein whose dysfunction causes hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome including Navajo neurohepatopathy [19,20]. The third cell line under study was depleted of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). MnSOD is the second (SOD2) of three superoxide dismutases; in contrast to the cytosolic (SOD1), and the extracellular (SOD3), it is found in the mitochondrial matrix. All SODs are responsible for the dismutation of superoxide anion radicals to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Importantly, deficiency of MnSOD in several cell types and in organs of mice was shown to contribute to carcinogenesis [21,22].",

In the MECR-Scr and MECR-KD cells neither treatment with ascorbate nor with H 2 O 2 had an effect on HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels under both normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 5A). In Mpv17 +/+ cells treatment with ascorbate let to a slight reduction in the HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels by about 30% under hypoxia compared to the untreated cells under hypoxia, whereas treatment with H 2 O 2 induced the HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels by about 1.3-fold, but only under hypoxia (Fig. 5C). In contrast, ascorbate induced the HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels in Mpv17 -/cells only under normoxia. Treatment of the Mpv17 -/cells with H 2 O 2 had no effect on HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels under normoxic and hypoxic conditions compared to the untreated control ( Fig. 5C). In MnSOD-Scr cells ascorbate treatment induced HIF-1\u03b1 under normoxia by about 2-fold and under hypoxia by about 10-fold. Treatment with H 2 O 2 let to a reduction by about 50% under hypoxia (Fig. 5E). Importantly, knockdown of MnSOD abolished the hypoxiadependent HIF-1\u03b1 induction. Ascorbate treatment of the MnSOD-KD cells strongly increased the HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels by about 7-fold under both normoxia and hypoxia. Upon exposure of these cells to H 2 O 2 almost no HIF-1\u03b1 protein could be detected (Fig. 5E). Thus, these findings indicate that H 2 O 2 and ascorbate can influence the HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels differently in the used cells with non-ETC defects.

Accordingly, we analyzed HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The obtained data indicated that there were no significant changes in the HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels in MECR-Scr cells under hypoxia. However, HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels were reduced in MECR-KD cells by about 40% under both normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 7A). In Mpv17 +/+ cells hypoxia let to a reduction in the HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels by about 40%. In contrast, loss of Mpv17 let to an increase of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels by about 30% under normoxia and by about 25% under hypoxia (Fig. 7A). The MnSOD-Scr cells had about 30% induced HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels in response to hypoxia. In contrast, MnSOD-KD cells showed a significant reduction in HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels by about 60% under normoxia and by 20% under hypoxia (Fig. 7A).

Surprisingly, there were no significant changes detectable in the mRNA levels of GLUT1 under hypoxia in the MnSOD-Scr cells (Fig. 7B,C). In line with the reduced HIF-1\u03b1 levels, knockdown of MECR significantly reduced GLUT1 as well as LDHA mRNA levels under both normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 7B,C).

This is in part likely due to the fact that the majority of studies focused either on the depletion of mitochondrial DNA (rho(0)-cells), or on the inhibition of the ETC via pharmacological approaches as well as by using cells with major ETC defects (for review see [25][26][27][28]).

First, the data show that three different non-ETC and non-Krebs cycle mitochondrial defects contribute to HIF-1\u03b1 regulation in a different manner. Thereby, cells lacking the key enzyme of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis MECR, and cells lacking MnSOD showed a reduced induction of HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxia. By contrast, cells lacking the mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome channel protein Mpv17 displayed enhanced levels of HIF-1\u03b1 already under normoxic conditions. Second, our study shows that ROS do not exert a uniform pattern when mediating their effects on HIF-1\u03b1, although all mitochondrial defects in the used cell types increased ROS formation under normoxia. Third, the current data indicate that the mitochondrial defects cause the different HIF-1\u03b1 regulation via promoting HIF-1\u03b1 degradation as well as via changes in HIF-1\u03b1 transcription. Thereby, MECR-and MnSOD-deficient cells showed a reduction in HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels whereas the Mpv17 lacking cells displayed enhanced HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels under normoxia and hypoxia."

This is due to the fact that mtFAS is involved in the synthesis of lipoic acid (LA) which is as a covalently bound cofactor essential for the activity of the above mentioned enzymes. Hence, a loss of MECR leads to a loss of lipoylated proteins [29,30]. With respect to HIF\u03b1 regulation this may be especially relevant if considering KGD activity and the accumulation Fig. 6.

Moreover, the reduced HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels add to this effect and may be seen in conjunction with the role of MECR in the regulation of pentose metabolism. Together, the findings with respect to MECR and its effect on HIF-1\u03b1 regulation are in line with its role in causing an inborn error of metabolism which resembles typical mitochondrial disorders with the involvement of organs being susceptible to oxygen deficiency such as basal ganglia and the optic nerve [18].",

These rho(0)-Hep3B and HEK293 cells were earlier shown to fail to induce HIF-1\u03b1 and to generate ROS in response to hypoxia [12,15,31], hence, we expected that Mpv17 deficiency would abolish HIF-1\u03b1 induction. Although we observed the opposite on the overall level of HIF-1\u03b1, we do not believe that cell-type specific effects as previously discussed in a report investigating the rho(0) effect in a human rho(0) osteosarcoma cell line with normal induction of HIF-1\u03b1 [32] account for this regulation. We think that, in this particular case, the Mpv17 \u0394\u03c8mand ROS-modulating channel activity [20] and its subsequent, so far unknown, signaling account for these effects.",

The data of the current and other reports [33] support this view. In particular, we found that hypoxia decreases \u0394\u03c8 m in all cell types investigated. Uncoupling of the ETC by dinitrophenol (DNP) elicited the expected dye responses indicating that the observed changes mirror the activity of the respiratory chain, although TMRE was used in a quenching mode. Interestingly, lack of MECR and Mpv17 increased \u0394\u03c8 m likely due to enhanced ROS formation especially under normoxia and although to a lesser extent, under hypoxia; by contrast, MnSOD-deficient cells displayed reduced \u0394\u03c8 m but also enhanced ROS formation. Overall, these data suggest a mutual relation between \u0394\u03c8 m and ROS where ROS levels can change \u0394\u03c8 m and vice versa changes in \u0394\u03c8 m may affect ROS production. This may, to a certain extent reflect also the severity of the mitochondrial defect and in this regard, the total lack of channelforming activity in Mpv17 deficient cells causes mitophagy, a process ultimately linked to hypoxic cell death and autophagy [20]. Thus, the increase in HIF-1\u03b1 in Mpv17 lacking cells is in line with the findings showing that HIF-1\u03b1 acts as an inducer of the Bcl2 family members, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) or BINP3L which both promote mitochondrial elimination via autophagosome formation [34].",

However, our data also showed that H 2 O 2 or the ROS scavenger ascorbate contributed to HIF regulation, although with different effects with respect to cell type and mitochondrial defect. This is in particular evident in the MnSOD deficient cells which do not show an upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxia but where the ascorbate exposure strongly induces HIF-1\u03b1 under both normoxia and hypoxia. These findings fit with previous reports from MnSOD overexpressing human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells, where a highly increased MnSOD activity promoted HIF-1\u03b1 appearance and overexpression of H 2 O 2 metabolizing enzymes prevented HIF-1\u03b1 induction under hypoxia [22]. Since the efficacies of superoxide dismutase and ascorbic acid for catalyzing the decay of superoxide radicals in animal tissues are similar [36] our data fit with the proposal that an increase in HIF-1\u03b1 could be mediated by mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide. Our earlier findings [37,38] and reports from other groups [39][40][41] support that this may be partially the case and, as discussed earlier [26], depend on the cell type. Our data also support this, since addition of H 2 O 2 to Mpv17 +/+ cells increased HIF-1\u03b1 levels. However, when control and deficient MECR NIH 3T3 fibroblasts as well as MnSOD HepG2 cells were exposed to H 2 O 2 , HIF-1\u03b1 was not found to be induced, neither under normoxia nor under hypoxia. Although these data fit with the idea that ROS can regulate HIF-1\u03b1, they appear not to follow the same regulatory mechanism influencing PHD-mediated HIF-1\u03b1 degradation. This is based on the observation that the HIF-1\u03b1 half-life is decreased in all cells with mitochondrial defects investigated here, although they all displayed enhanced ROS levels. Thus, these findings prompted us to look into the HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA expression pattern. Importantly, we found that the HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels correlated with the protein levels; decreased HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA and protein levels in MECR-and MnSODdeficient cells and the opposite in Mpv17-lacking cells. Thus, these data suggest that, redox sensitive transcription factors could contribute to the changes in HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA. In particular, NF\u03baB [38,42] and Nrf2 [35] may account for an induction of HIF-1\u03b1 expression. However, it is unlikely that these factors also directly mediate the negative effects on HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA abundance. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that either other transcription factors or indirect regulators of NF\u03baB and Nrf2 may be involved.",

            "text": "In addition to other interacting transcription factors, indirect regulators may also be miRNAs. Indeed, previous reports suggested that several miRNAs, being regulated by hypoxia, ROS, or regulating antioxidant responses can contribute to the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, TCA cycle activity as well as transcription factors such as HIFs, NF\u03baB, and Nrf2 [43][44][45]. Thereby, miRNAs such as miR210, which during hypoxia represses the iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins ISCU1/2, affect TCA cycle activity and oxidative phosphorylation [46]. Further, miR9 that controls for example the NF\u03baB1/p50 subunit, or miR200a that affects the Nrf2 regulator Keap1, or miR126 [47] may affect HIF-1\u03b1 expression and stabilization. Again, cell-type specific effects may account for differences. For example, miR126 was found to be up-regulated by hypoxia and oxidative stress in nonmalignant mesothelial cell lines. By contrast, in malignant H28 mesothelioma cells the induction of miR126 by hypoxia and oxidative stress was lost [47]. Thus, certain miRNAs, identification of which was not the scope of this study, may serve in important feedback loops and future work will provide us with the details about those.",

            "text": "The survival of cells under hypoxia is also accompanied by active changes in mitochondrial function. For example, HIF-1\u03b1 directs processes leading to downregulation of complex I activity and complex IV activity [48][49][50]. In addition to limiting the entry of metabolites into the TCA cycle, the HIF system was also shown to shut down O 2demanding processes such as fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. Indeed, hypoxia reduced the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) [51], which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the mitochondrial import of fatty acids for \u03b2-oxidation. Moreover, hypoxia exposure reduced expression of the medium-and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (MCAD and LCAD) [52] and decreased ROS as well as an important regulator of \u03b2-oxidation proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1) protein levels [51,52]. These findings are concurrent with the present study. However, when PGC-1 expression was analyzed under normoxia we found that its expression was increased in all cells harboring a mitochondrial defect. Since PGC-1 is considered to be one of the most, if not the most, important driver of mitochondrial biosynthesis these effects constitute likely a feedback mechanism by which the cells aim to compensate for their respective deficit in mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial number and mtDNA, as well as mitochondrial protein composition can vary with the mutations and interventions, and PGC-1 variations support this. Further, this also correlates well with the enhanced ROS levels under normoxia which are known to be activators of PGC-1 [53].",
