We evaluated whether early elevated plasma level of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is useful for these purposes in patients with ST-elevation MI (STEMI). Methods and Results-We first studied MIF level in plasma and the myocardium in mice and determined infarct size. MI for 15 or 60 minutes resulted in 2.5-fold increase over control values in plasma MIF levels while MIF content in the ischemic myocardium reduced by 50% and plasma MIF levels correlated with myocardium-at-risk and infarct size at both time-points (P<0.01). In patients with STEMI, we obtained admission plasma samples and measured MIF, conventional troponins (TnI, TnT), high sensitive TnI (hsTnI), creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and myoglobin. Infarct size was assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Patients with chronic stable angina and healthy volunteers were studied as controls. Of 374 STEMI patients, 68% had elevated admission MIF levels above the highest value in healthy controls (>41.6 ng/mL), a proportion similar to hsTnI (75%) and TnI (50%), but greater than other biomarkers studied (20% to 31%, all P<0.05 versus MIF). Only admission MIF levels correlated with CMR-derived infarct size, ventricular volumes and ejection fraction (n=42, r=0.46 to 0.77, all P<0.01) at 3 day and 3 months post-MI. Conclusion-Plasma MIF levels are elevated in a high proportion of STEMI patients at the first obtainable sample and these levels are predictive of final infarct size and the extent of cardiac remodeling.",

We recruited consecutive patients with STEMI over 18 years of age who attended the Department of Cardiology, Third Hospital of Peking University during the period of 2008-2010. Patients with a diagnosis of STEMI (chest pain \u226530 minutes in duration, and electrocardiographic changes of new ischemia: ST elevation at the J point \u22650.1 mV in 2 contiguous leads) who underwent initial admission blood sampling within 6 hours after the onset of chest pain prior to any reperfusion interventions were eligible for inclusion. Patients having 1 or more of the following criteria were excluded: suspected or known previous MI in the same coronary artery territory as the current STEMI, rescue angioplasty, cardiogenic shock (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg), or renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate \u226430 mL/min). A total of 332 patients with STEMI meeting these inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in this report. We also recruited 58 healthy consecutive volunteers who had no evidence of cardiovascular and other systemic disease as determined on history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram from the Risk Assessment Clinic, the Third Hospital, and 26 patients with chronic stable angina who had evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) verified by chart review (prior coronary angiograms or history of MI) and by their treating physicians and in whom there had not been any recent deterioration of anginal symptoms or CCS (Canadian Cardiovascular Society) class within the previous 6 months. Plasma samples were used for assay of MIF, TnT, CK-MB, and other routine laboratory analyses (see below). We included both a healthy control group and patients with chronic stable angina in order to investigate differences in not only MIF but also each of the other biomarkers of cardiomyocyte necrosis in each of the groups. This would serve to provide evidence for changes in MIF or other biomarker status according to different health states and clinical presentation. Compared to an apparently healthy phenotype, those patients with documented CAD might be expected to exhibit a different biomarker profile. Thus, it would be important to have baseline knowledge of different biomarker profiles when comparing against patients with STEMI.",

LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated by volumetric analysis from a contiguous short axis FIESTA stack covering the LV and right ventricle using the summation of disc method 29 by 2 cardiologists. For determination of myocardium-at-risk, LV short-axis slices covering the whole LV using a T2-weighted triple-inversion recovery breathhold fast spinecho pulse sequence were obtained using a body coil. Myocardium-at-risk was quantified by manual delineation of myocardium with bright signal intensity 2 SD above the mean signal obtained in the remote, noninfarct myocardium and multiplying the slice thickness and the myocardial density of 1.05 g/mL, expressed as a percentage of LV mass. Late enhancement images covering the whole LV were acquired %15 minutes after intravenous administration of a bolus of gadolinium-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) to identify regional necrosis/fibrosis for infarct size quantification using an inversion recovery gradient echo technique. The area of hyperenhanced myocardium (bounded by endocardial and epicardial contours) on each of the shortaxis slice was manually traced then multiplied by the slice thickness and the myocardial density of 1.05 g/mL to obtain the infarct mass, and expressed as a percentage of LV mass (infarct size). 30 All analyses were performed offline on dedicated workstations running AW SDC 4.4 and IDL version 6.3 with ReportCARD version 3.6 by fully blinded observers with excellent reproducibility (r=0.98) for infarct size assessment. 26,29 ",

Admission plasma MIF levels correlated significantly with CMR-derived infarct size at day-3 post-MI whereas other biomarkers measured did not (Figure 3). Moreover, admission MIF levels also correlated with peak level and AUC for TnI (r=0.669 and 0.678, both P<0.001) and CK (r=0.513 and 0.695, both P<0.001). Day-3 infarct size closely correlated with peak level and AUC for CK (r=0.589 and 0.775, both P<0.001) and TnI (r=0.660 and 0.859, both P<0.001) as well, suggesting that MIF is a reliable marker for infarct size prediction. Importantly, admission MIF levels also correlated with myocardium-at-risk at day 3 ( Figure 4A) and chronic infarct size 3 months post-MI ( Figure 4B). Furthermore, standard multiple regression analysis revealed that among the 5 admission biomarkers tested (eg, MIF, hsTnI, CK, myoglobin, and hsCRP) only MIF emerged as a significant independent predictor of both day 3 and 3 months infarct size (data not shown). Notably, admission MIF levels also exhibited a significant relationship with CMRderived LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexed (LVEDVI, LVESVI) and LVEF determined at 3 days and 3 months post-MI (all P<0.01, Figure 4). All significant associations reported for admission MIF were still present and essentially unchanged when examined in regression analyses, which also included age, gender, and body mass index in addition to admission MIF as independent variables. In these analyses, age was significantly related to LVEF (r=0.048) and body mass index to LVEDVI (r=0.037) at day-3 post-MI, but there were no other significant associations with age, gender, or body mass index. hsCRP assay was also performed in patients with STEMI (the Melbourne cohort). Plasma hsCRP levels were unchanged at admission but increased by 10-fold at 48 hours post-MI. Furthermore, admission hsCRP levels neither correlated with admission MIF levels nor with infarct size measured by CMR at 3 days ( Figure 5), while hsCRP levels at 48 hours post-MI significantly correlated with admission MIF levels and day-3 infarct size (all P<0.05, Figure 5). However, there were no significant associations involving hsCRP at 48 hours post-MI when these were examined using log e transformed hsCRP values in regression analyses which also included age, gender, and body mass index.",

            "text": "Three important findings have been made in the present study. First, we demonstrated in the mouse MI model that there was a rapid increase in circulating MIF, which occurred earlier than that of TnI and was accompanied by a reciprocal reduction in myocardial MIF content suggesting release of MIF from the ischemic myocardium into circulation. Elevated plasma MIF levels correlated with the mass of ischemic and infarcted myocardium. Second, elevation of plasma MIF was observed in 68% of patients with STEMI at the earliest available samples after admission, and this proportion was similar to hsTnI or TnI, but significantly higher than other conventional cardiac biomarkers measured (19% to 30%) at the same time. Third, in patients with STEMI, admission levels of MIF, but not other biomarkers, correlated positively with infarct size and LV chamber size, and negatively with LVEF measured both acutely (day 3) and at 3 months. Our experimental and clinical findings indicate that a single MIF assay at admission could be a useful biomarker for early prediction of final infarct size and might have utility in the early detection of myocardial necrosis. Previous clinical studies reported an increase in plasma MIF levels in patients with acute MI 4 to 6 hours after admission, 22 which remained elevated over the next 2 weeks. 21 However, it remains unclear if MIF circulating levels might be detectable earlier than 4 to 6 hours after symptom onset in patients with acute MI (STEMI). Our findings from mice and patients with acute MI demonstrated a much earlier elevation of plasma MIF levels than previously reported. In mice, a brief period of ischemia (15 minutes) induced a significant increase in circulating MIF level. Specifically, admission plasma MIF levels determined at a median of 216 minutes (Beijing cohort) or 211 minutes (Melbourne cohort) of symptom-to-sampling time were already elevated in 68% to 71% of patients with STEMI compared to 19% to 50% for other biomarkers studied with the exception of hsTnI (75%). Although release of MIF by cardiac tissue or cardiomyocytes has been reported in in vitro settings of hypoxia, ischemia or oxidative stress, 18,21 our in vivo animal model further documented the cardiac source of circulating MIF manifested by reciprocal changes in plasma MIF levels and in the ischemic myocardium. A reduction of MIF density in the ischemic myocardium was observed by immunohistochemistry. There are several reasons why a biomarker that could predict final infarct size might be desirable in the clinical management of patients presenting with STEMI. Early changes in circulating levels of this biomarker would facilitate decision-making about the timeliness of reperfusion, particularly in regions of the world where healthcare resources are limited. It would also facilitate appropriate resource allocation for specific patients who are likely to need more intensive medical attention. Currently available biomarkers require serial assays to determine peak values and/or AUC for infarct size quantification. In contrast, MIF levels obtained from our experimental mouse MI model, correlated with ischemic and infarct mass at 15 and 60 minutes post-CAO, whereas TnI assay showed no such correlation, Similarly, in our clinical studies, while there was no predictive value for infarct size by CK, hsTnI, TnI, and myoglobin, at the time of hospital presentation, an impressive correlation between a single admission MIF level and infarct size determined by CMR either acutely or at 3 months was observed. These findings raise the prospect that MIF may prove to be useful in the clinical setting, especially in the emergency department or coronary care unit. Release of conventional biomarkers from  Figure 3. Admission (adm.) macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) levels, but not other cardiac biomarkers, for example, high sensitive troponin I (hsTnI), creatine kinase (CK), and myoglobin, correlated with cardiac magnetic resonance-derived infarct size determined at day 3 (d3) after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Data were from the Melbourne cohort. Pearson correlation for MIF and Spearman correlation for other biomarkers were performed to detect a correlation with infarct size.",

A recent study reported that the plasma level of CRP at 2 days after acute MI correlated with an inflammatory marker, interleukin-6, and infarct size. 35 We therefore elected to study the relationship between MIF and a surrogate marker of inflammation, hsCRP, in the Melbourne Cohort. Unlike MIF, plasma hsCRP level was not elevated at the time of admission but increased at 48 hours after STEMI and only hsCRP levels at 48 hours correlated with admission MIF levels and with day-3 infarct size, similar to the previous report. 35 The lack of a correlation between admission MIF and hsCRP levels suggests that a rapid release of cardiac MIF is a supra-acute reaction to the ischemic insult. However, it is possible that the subsequent sustained rise of circulating MIF reported previously 22,23 may be related to a systemic inflammation and this requires a further investigation.",

Plasma MIF in mice correlated with the extent of the ischemic myocardium. This observation implies that MIF is also released from ischemic-but-viable myocardium following severe ischemic stress. Although plasma TnI was also elevated at this timepoint, there was no correlation between TnI level and size of myocardium-at-risk. Similarly, both admission MIF and hsTnI levels were elevated in STEMI patients, but only MIF levels closely correlated with CMR-derived size of myocardium-atrisk. These results suggest a predictive value of early circulating MIF levels with the extent of ischemic myocardium. Therefore, we propose that MIF may represent a new class of biomarker that is released by the myocardium upon acute ischemic insult but without the necessity for tissue necrosis. Furthermore, the predictive value of admission MIF levels was not only limited to acute and final infarct size, but was also associated with parameters of cardiac remodeling and dysfunction.

However, we demonstrated that the very early rise in plasma MIF levels is most likely due to release of preformed cardiomyocyte stores providing a plausible biologic explanation that closely couples the early release of MIF, which might be of use in early detection of myocardial necrosis, with infarct size insofar as reflecting the magnitude of overall myocardial injury or necrosis that is subsequently quantified by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The possibility that MIF might be of utility in the early detection of myocardial necrosis needs to be investigated in future studies in patients who present with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, including unstable angina, to properly assess the diagnostic performance of MIF against other biomarkers. Second, our study was not designed to specifically compare the diagnostic performance of MIF versus established biomarkers. We acknowledge that hsTns, which have a lower limit of detection with higher sensitivity for early diagnosis than conventional troponin assays, need to be compared against MIF in future studies. While the diagnostic performance of hsTn in detecting myocardial necrosis is excellent with superior sensitivity and precision over conventional troponin assays, there are still well recognized challenges and limitations in adopting and implementing the use of hsTn in early diagnosis of acute MI. 36 For example, the appropriate reference (99th percentile) value to use clinically is different for men versus women (a situation that might be similar to observed differences in MIF levels between men and women and also with increasing age); solitary elevations of hsTn values (>99th percentile) is thought to be inadequate for clinical decision making and serial changes in hsTn values will still be required to determine acute myocardial injury. Thus, each biomarker has advantages and limitations depending on the pretest with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and correlation between hsCRP and migration inhibitory factor (MIF) or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-derived infarct size at 3 days post-MI. Plasma hsCRP was not elevated at admission (adm.) but was increased after 48 hours post-MI. Admission hsCRP correlated neither with admission MIF levels nor day 3 infarct size. However, plasma hsCRP at 48 hours post-MI correlated with admission MIF levels and infarct size. n=10, 9, 42 for healthy controls, CSA, and MI (both admission and 48 hours post-MI) groups, respectively. *P<0.01 vs other groups. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to detect significance in hsCRP between groups with Dunns post-hoc test. Spearman correlation was performed for correlation between MIF, hsCRP, or infarct size.",

In our study we did not use the MIF 99th percentile to define our upper reference limit but rather the highest value of healthy control participants. Although our study, to our knowledge, is the first study to publish the distribution of MIF levels in the largest sample of normal controls, the sample size of 50 (Melbourne cohort) and 58 (Beijing cohort) remains relatively small. We plan to undertake future studies involving larger numbers of normal controls in order to define the 99th MIF percentile. Third, MIF is not cardiac-specific, however, rapid rise of circulating MIF levels within a short time-window during the early phase post-MI period strongly supports a cardiac origin. Finally, we excluded patients with a prior infarct in order to minimize any confounding related to the interpretation of biomarker levels with myocardium-at-risk and infarct size. Patients with prior infarction are known to have a smaller myocardium-at-risk. Therefore, by only including patients without prior infarct, we believe this to be a more appropriate study design in our evaluation of the relationship between biomarkers (MIF) with myocardium-at-risk and infarct size. In addition, it is possible that patients with prior MI who present with their current MI might have a smaller rise in MIF levels as would be predicted by the size of MI imaged on CMR, which is a composite of old and new MI. Thus, by including only patients without prior MI this confounding effect could be minimized.",
