            "text": "The modal firm size in most developing countries is one worker, consisting of only the owner of the firm. Among the firms that do hire additional workers, most hire fewer than ten. Hsieh and Olken (2014, p. 93) report that in India and Indonesia \"the fraction of firms with less than 10 workers is almost visually indistinguishable from 100 percent.\" Likewise in Nigeria, survey data indicate that 99.6 percent of firms have fewer than ten workers. 1 This is in sharp contrast to the United States, where the modal manufacturing firm has 45 workers (Hsieh and Klenow 2014), and is a puzzle to standard models of the firm size distribution (Lucas 1978) unless the distribution of entrepreneurial talent is very limited in developing countries. The move away from self-employment toward wage employment in firms of larger sizes is a key aspect of the development process (e.g., Gollin 2002). This raises the key policy questions of whether there are constrained entrepreneurs in developing countries with the ability to grow a firm beyond this 10-worker threshold, and if so, whether policy can identify such individuals in advance and overcome their constraints to growth.",

The YouWiN! competition was launched in late 2011 by the president of Nigeria, and in its first year attracted almost 24,000 applications aiming to start a new business or expand an existing one. The top 6,000 applications were selected for a 4-day business plan training course, and then winners were chosen to receive awards averaging US$50,000 each, paid out in four tranche payments conditional on achieving basic milestones. The top-scoring plans overall and within region were chosen as winners automatically, and then 729 additional winners were randomly selected from a group of 1,841 semifinalists, providing experimental variation from US$34 million in grants that enables causal estimation of the program's impact. Three annual follow-up surveys enable tracking the trajectory of impacts, with the third survey occurring 27 months after winners received their first grant payment and 12 to 18 months after the last payment. A final survey round conducted during an economic crisis in 2016 enables examination of impacts three years after all payments."

            "text": "I find that winning this competition has large positive impacts on both applicants looking to start new firms as well as those aiming to expand existing firms. Three years after applying, new firm applicant winners were 37 percentage points more likely than the control group to be operating a business and 23 percentage points more likely to have a firm with ten or more workers (relative to a control mean of 11 percent), while existing firm winners were 20 percentage points more likely to have survived, and 21 percentage points more likely to have a firm with ten or more workers (relative to a control mean of 17 percent). The winners are also innovating more, and are earning higher sales and profits. There continue to be significant impacts more than three years after all payment, during an economic crisis, although the magnitudes are smaller. Examining the channels of impact, I find the grants enabled firms to purchase more capital and hire more labor, with no changes in business networks, mentors, self-efficacy, or uses of other sources of finance. The results show there is a group of constrained entrepreneurs with the ability to grow their businesses beyond a small scale, and that the business plan competition was successful in both attracting such individuals, and in helping them overcome their constraints."

The first addresses the sources and constraints to job growth, which is one of the most fundamental concerns of policymakers globally. An increasing body of work examines which types of firms create more jobs, with recent evidence highlighting the importance of business startups and young firms in job creation. 2 Related work has found that a small number of firms, variously termed \"gazelles,\" \"high-growth entrepreneurs,\" or \"high-impact firms\" represent a tiny fraction of the overall firm population, but make a disproportionately large contribution to job growth. 3 New job creation by firms is of particular importance in sub-Saharan Africa given that it currently has the lowest share of the labor force in wage work of any region in the world, and that demographic forces result in the working-age population growing 2.8 percent per year (ILO 2012). A long literature suggests that a perceived lack of high-growth entrepreneurship in many African countries (e.g., Elkan 1988; Omidyar Network 2013) may be in part due to multiple market failures that prevent individuals with good ideas from funding them. This paper provides empirical evidence that there are such potential high growth entrepreneurs who can grow rapidly if funded.",

While the first such competitions were held for business school students in the United States they are now increasingly being used in developing countries. 4 Examples include the MENA 100 business plan competition in 14 countries in the Middle East and North Africa since 2009, the GIST/I-Dare business plan competition for individuals from 28 developing countries, launched in 2011; and business plan competitions run by Technoserve throughout Central America since 2002 (Klinger and Sch\u00fcndeln 2011).

Many of the programs are small in nature, awarding fewer than ten prizes in any given year, limiting the sample size for evaluation. Programs explicitly try to select entrepreneurs with the best growth prospects, so that any comparison of winners and losers is likely to overstate the effects of the program due to selection bias. Klinger and Sch\u00fcndeln (2011) and Fafchamps and Quinn (forthcoming) attempt to address these issues by pooling together competitions run in multiple countries to get larger sample sizes of winners (although still fewer than 40 cash winners in either study), and use a regression-discontinuity approach to compare winners to those who just finished below them in rank. Both studies find impacts on business start-up or expansion, and Fafchamps and Quinn (forthcoming) also find increased job creation in the first six months. In the one experimental study we are aware of, Fafchamps and Woodruff (2016) run a small business plan competition in Ghana, in which winners are selected to receive individualized training, but not cash. They find no significant impact of this individualized training on firm growth. This paper builds on this literature through experimental evaluation of a much larger sample, with substantial prizes, detailed surveys, and a longer time period for tracking winners.",

This is the case with work testing small grants of US$100 to US$200 to existing businesses (e.g., De Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2008;McKenzie and Woodruff 2008;Fafchamps et al. 2014;Karlan, Knight, and Udry 2015); ultra-poor programs providing grants and training to get very poor people to start businesses (e.g., Banerjee et al. 2015;Bandiera et al. 2017); and business training programs for microenterprises (reviewed in McKenzie and Woodruff 2014). Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez (2014) considers a program in Uganda where groups received grants of approximately US$382 per member, and finds this generates increases in skilled self-employment and in incomes for the recipients, but only minor increases in employment in these firms. Fafchamps and Quinn (forthcoming) provide grants of US$1,000 to their 39 winners. The grants studied here of almost US$50,000 per recipient are 50 to 500 times as large as the grants in these earlier studies.",

First, even a standard concave production function with a low steady-state optimal size can exhibit high returns to capital for the first few dollars invested, so the fact that marginal returns from small grants have been high need not imply that capital is the constraint to growing larger firms who hire workers. Second, since the lending cost per dollar lent falls with loan size, credit market frictions are expected to be particularly binding for small loans, and one therefore might expect credit constraints to be less binding for larger investments. If credit constraints don't bind, then theory would predict the grants would merely supplement the wealth of business owners without changing their production decisions. Even with credit constraints, there is a question as to whether diminishing returns to capital results in grants of this size being far more than is needed to move businesses to their efficient size. The results in this paper show that the business plan competition is successful in identifying entrepreneurs with the potential to use these large amounts of capital, and that with this capital, they are able to generate enterprises that hire employees and exhibit rapid growth."

Only 6 of the 1,200 winners received no payment (due to being disqualified, or in one case, withdrawing). A total of 1,168 winners (97.3 percent), including 96.8 percent of the experimental winners, received all four tranche payments, but the length of time taken to receive all four tranches varied across firms: 748 of the firms received their last tranche payment in June or July 2013, while the last 33 recipients got their last tranche in January 2014. Table 1 presents summary statistics for the treatment and control groups according to assignment to treatment status for new and existing firms, as well as the characteristics of the non-experimental winners. The goal of the randomization is to ensure that the treatment and control groups are similar in terms of average characteristics. This is tested formally through an F-test of joint orthogonality, which tests whether the observable characteristics in Table 1 are jointly unrelated to treatment status. We cannot reject this null hypothesis, confirming that randomization has delivered balanced groups. In contrast the test rejects that the observable characteristics of the national and zonal winners are similar to those of the experimental sample, even when excluding the business plan scores used to separate the groups. Table 1 is also useful for showing some basic characteristics of the experimental sample. We see the average existing firm owner is male, aged 32, with 4 years of business experience and running a business with a median of 5 workers. Half are married, and 10 percent have previously worked or lived abroad, and 65 percent have university education. Only 7 percent have ever had a formal loan before for their business. New applicants are slightly younger, with an average age of 29, 70 percent have university education, and they have higher business plan scores than the existing firm applicants on average, reflecting the preference for existing firm applicants at each stage. We see they come from relatively well-off households, with 85 percent having a computer at home and two-thirds having a satellite dish. The most common business sectors are manufacturing and crop and animal production, sector is looked at in more detail below. The mean (median) annual turnover for existing businesses in the experimental sample is 5.6 million naira (1.5 million naira). The maximum grant of 10 million naira thus represents two years of turnover for the mean firm and more than six years for the median firm.",

This conditionality does not fundamentally change the equilibrium first-order conditions, but can be viewed as causing a temporary increase in the returns to capital and labor in the firm. Therefore we would predict a short-term increase in capital and labor, which would then dissipate once all the tranche payments have been received. Once the final payments are received, we should see no difference between treatment and control firms as the treated firms reduce capital and labor to get back to the equilibrium levels. 13 Case 3 (YouWiN! Program is More Than Just a Grant): It is possible that participating in, and especially winning, the YouWiN! program may also have other impacts on the productivity of the firm (A), and the skills of the owner (E ). The training offered could increase the entrepreneurial skills of the owner, although since the business plan training was also provided to the control group, this should change the first-order conditions similarly for both groups, and it would only be if the small amount of additional training increased skills that we should see a treatment effect. If winning enables firm owners to meet other business owners or gain mentors, this could increase A and E. Winning might also change the confidence and attitudes, spurring the self-belief of the owner in the business and causing them to work harder; or alternatively, may dent the confidence of the control group.

In online Appendix 10, I also provide sharpened q-values that hold constant the false discovery rate when reporting results for specific outcomes-all outcomes in Tables 2-8 that have p-values below 0.10 also have sharpened q-values below 0.05. Table 2 examines the impact of the competition on whether applicants for new enterprises set up a business and have it subsequently survive (panel A), and whether applicants with existing enterprises have these businesses survive (panel B). The first three columns show the extensive margin of whether a firm operates or not, while the remaining three columns combine the extensive and intensive margins to consider how many hours a week the owner works in his or her own firm.

Online Appendix 13 shows that the new applicants are innovating more in multiple dimensions, introducing new products, processes, pricing methods, quality control systems, using the internet, and using new channels for selling goods. As is standard in developing countries, most of this innovation involves moving toward the world frontier by introducing new products or processes that are new for the firm and often its city or neighborhood, but that are available elsewhere in the country or in the world. As such, they are similar to capital inputs, for which the alleviation of credit constraints allows more of these innovation inputs to be purchased.

The quantile treatment effects for the last survey round show positive and significant impacts on firm profits for all quantiles between the twentieth and the eighty-fourth for new firm applicants, and for all quantiles between the twelfth and the seventy-sixth for existing firm applicants.

Moreover, if conditionality were the reason for hiring, it would not explain why the majority of winners hire more workers than needed to be hired to receive the tranche payment. Seventy-eight percent of the winning firms have more employees than required at the time of the second survey, and 73 percent at the time of the third survey.

Online Appendix 15 provides results. There is no significant change in entrepreneurial self-efficacy, which measures the owner's self-confidence in their ability to carry out 12 business-related actions such as \"estimate customer demand for a new product,\" and \"identify good employees who can help the business grow.\" This also helps rule out the concern that the control group has become less self-confident as a result of not winning. There is also no change in the likelihood the firm owner has a business mentor, or in the number of other firm owner's they discuss business with. These suggest the main mechanisms are not through more confidence and connections. There is a minor improvement in business practices for the new firms operating, but the magnitude of the effect is likely to explain only a 0.2 percent increase in the likelihood of operating, and a 4 percent change in profits. There is no increase in business practices for existing firms. This set of results suggest that the impact is not coming through the mechanisms of increasing A and E. Table 5 examines how winning affected the firm's use of capital. The first two columns consider the use of outside finance in the form of formal loans and equity investment, respectively. The use of both forms of finance is very low, with fewer than 3 percent of the new firm applicants in the control group receiving either form of financing in a given year, and only 6 percent of existing firm applicants having received a formal loan in any given year, and fewer than 5 percent receiving equity investments. We see relatively little impact on crowd-in or crowd-out of these other sources of financing. New firm applicants were 2.6 percentage points more likely to receive equity financing in round 2, and existing firm applicants were 3.9 percentage points less likely to receive a formal loan in round 2. 17 The remaining columns of Table 5, in contrast, show that the grants greatly increased the amount of capital in the winning firms. Treated firms have higher inventory levels, are more likely to have made a purchase of business equipment, land, or buildings of over 100,000 naira, and have spent more on such purchases. The result is that the total capital stock of the treated firms is 3.5 million naira higher than the 800,000 naira control mean among new applicants at the time of round 3, and 4.3 million naira higher than the 2.5 million naira control mean among existing applicants.

In online Appendix 16, I examine two more pieces of evidence for capital being the main driver of impact. I use the heterogeneity in the amount of grant received among the experimental winners and find those winners who received larger grants were able to grow larger. 18 I also consider heterogeneity in impacts with respect to the potential importance of capital constraints to the firm at the time of application, finding modest evidence that more capital-constrained firms benefited more from the grants, but also that almost everyone says they are capital-constrained.",

As a comparison, real interest rates for SME finance are around 20 percent per annum. So the average return on capital is at the level needed to pay for a loan were credit available. However, these average returns will include higher returns for some firms and lower returns for others (including those whose businesses fail). Since loan financing does not allow banks to capture the high returns in the upside, but results in losses to the bank in the case of lower returns, in the absence of a way to distinguish well who is likely to succeed, banks will be reluctant to lend. Moreover, given this variability in returns, firms may be reluctant to borrow at prevailing interest rates. 20 This is seen in the data, with few control group firms receiving loans.",

The government imposed currency controls and import restrictions, which led to a parallel exchange rate and inflation reaching 18.5 percent, the highest in over a decade. In this difficult environment for firms, I went back and conducted a longer-term follow-up survey between July and November 2016. The survey was answered by 79.7 percent of treatment and 74.5 percent of control firms, and operating status was obtained for 92.5 percent of treatment and 90.9 percent of control firms. 21 Table 7 summarizes the impacts of the program during this time period, which is five years after applying and more than 3 years since all money has been received from the program. New firm applicants are still 24.1 percentage points more likely to be operating a firm, report 2.6 more workers, and are 11.1 percentage points more likely to have 10 or more workers than control firms. Existing firms are 9.5 percentage points more likely to be operating, have 3.0 more workers, and are 12.7 percentage points more likely to have 10 or more workers. These impacts are all significant at the 1 percent levels and large relative to the control means. The impact on the 21 A joint orthogonality test can not reject balance on baseline characteristics for the sample answering the survey for either new firms ( p = 0.857) or existing firms (0.985). level of profits is insignificant, but there is a positive and significant impact on the inverse hyperbolic sine of profits for both new and existing firms, and on the aggregate index of sales and profits for new firms. Online Appendix 19 shows the quantile treatment effect estimates are positive for profits in the middle of the distribution, but at the lower tail there is no impact with firms closed, and at the upper tail the variance is large. These results show that the program has continued to have positive impacts over a longer time horizon. However, the estimated impacts on firm operation and employment are smaller in magnitude than seen in round 3. This may reflect some of the additional firm growth achieved by treated firms being constrained by the weak economy.",

A first point to note is that administrative data on firms are rare in most developing countries, and there is a growing body of evidence to show that firms systematically misreport their revenues, costs, and wages to the authorities (Pomeranz 2015;Carrillo, Pomeranz, and Singhal 2017;Kumler, Verhoogen, and Fr\u00edas 2015), so that it is not clear that one should prefer administrative data over survey data even if it were available. Indeed the analysis in online Appendix 11 suggests that the administrative data on employment for the business plan competition winners is unreliable in our specific case. Second, the survey was designed and conducted in a manner to reduce reporting bias. It was conducted by a well-known independent market research company (TNS RMS Nigeria) and participants were told its \"purpose is to help better understand the growth process of enterprises being run by Nigerian youth, as well as the development process of youths thinking about starting a business,\" with participants told the results would be kept confidential and used for research purposes only. The first round survey asked about a variety of government programs, and not just YouWiN! Together these features are likely to make the survey responses less biased than if the data were collected in an official capacity by the government program implementers.

            "text": "Finally, although I need to rely on survey data for the majority of the analysis, there are a couple of checks of business size that are not based on self-reports. In the first and second round follow-ups, approximately 50 percent of the in-person surveys took place in the business (the rest taking place at the home or at a third location). In the third round, more emphasis was put on trying to interview at the business premises, and 90 percent of the in-person surveys of those operating businesses took place at the business. 23 Likewise, in the long-term follow-up round in 2016, 97 percent of the in-person surveys for those operating a business took place at the business location. For this subsample the interviewers physically counted how many employees they observed at the place of business. This is an undercount of true employment because it misses workers who are working in another location (e.g., in the homes of clients, in other stores, traveling, etc.) or who are temporarily absent. Nevertheless, it does provide a check of whether observed employment is larger for the treated firms. Second, throughout the survey rounds information was collected on whether the firms have a website, along with the URL. On October 4, 2015, and January 10, 2017 I tested to see whether each firm had a functioning URL. Having a functioning website is a proxy for being of a larger size three-and-a-half years and five years after winning. Table 8 reports the results of these checks. YouWiN! winners have significantly more observed workers and are more likely to have a functioning website for both new and existing applicants. This is true for both the third follow-up and the long-term survey round. At the time of the third follow-up, new firms have approximately three times as many employees observed at the premises among the experimental winners than the control group, and existing firms have almost twice as many employees observed. While the absolute levels are smaller, these ratios are similar to those in Table 3. Both new and existing firms are twice as likely to have a functioning website among the experimental winners as in the control group. While limited, these checks do help provide assurance that there is a genuine increase in firm sizes for the treated firms. 23 Those whose business had closed down or who had not started businesses were surveyed at their home or in a third location.

The first is a concern about internal validity: if the growth of the winners came at the expense of firms in the control group, the control group would no longer provide a valid counterfactual. This seems unlikely to be an important concern in our case, since the experimental sample is widely scattered over a country of 170 million people, and is not heavily concentrated in any single industry. As a check, online Appendix 20 shows that there is no heterogeneity in treatment effect, nor difference in control outcomes, with the number of other firms selected as winners in the same state and industry. As a result, the estimates should be internally valid, and are informative for showing the constraints facing individual businesses."

It seems unlikely that such a program would have the intensity randomized at the regional level as in the labor market intervention of Cr\u00e9pon et al. (2013), precluding a randomization approach to measuring these spillovers. Rotemberg (2015) uses detailed firm data from India and finds a small business subsidy program there did result in competitors losing market share, but not for those producing internationally traded markets. In the United States, Bronnenberg and Ellickson (2015) note that online sales have had a market expansion effect, by increasing convenience and product variety, so that gains to new entrants need not come from taking market share from incumbents, and they speculate that such channels may be more important in developing country markets.",

As an additional check on this, online Appendix 20 shows that winners were no more likely to reduce their product prices than the control group, suggesting that the channel for expansion was not taking market share through price competition.

The program studied here is a nationwide program to a large number of firms in Africa's largest country, and hence should be of intrinsic interest. Moreover, the competition has already been run in three more rounds in Nigeria. Nevertheless, there are reasons to believe the findings may generalize beyond Nigeria. As noted in the introduction, these types of business plan competitions have become increasingly common, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. While the amounts offered in Nigeria are high, they are far from unique-the average grant sizes in the Somalia business plan competition were $58,000 in round 1 and $67,000 in round 2, and awards of $25,000 were given in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The key difference here is the large number of winners and randomized selection provide the ability to evaluate and learn from this competition, which has not been possible in the other cases. It seems likely that these competitions in other countries are also inducing applications from entrepreneurs with high growth potential. Whether such entrepreneurs can be identified in alternative ways to business plan competitions and/or be supported through alternative policy instruments to grants are interesting questions for future research."

It has succeeded in generating more firms with ten or more employees, and provides the first experimental evidence of how direct policy action can spur the growth of such firms. The impacts are not consistent with a model of no market failures in which the grants would be predicted to increase the incomes of the business owners without changing their production decisions. Examination of the intermediate channels suggests that a main effect of the program has been to enable firms to buy more capital, innovate more, and hire more workers, with little impact on business practices, mentoring, or networking. The business plan competition seems an effective tool for identifying entrepreneurs with much greater scope for growth than the typical microenterprise."
