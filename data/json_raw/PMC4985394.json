            "text": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental endocrine disruptor that has been associated with cardiovascular outcomes in previous observational studies. We aimed to examine the relationships of urinary BPA levels with hypertension and early macrovascular diseases. This is a cross-sectional study. From June through August 2009, 3246 participants ages 40 years or older were enrolled from Baoshan District, Shanghai, China. Logistic regression modes were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for prevalent risk of hypertension, elevated carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), arterial stiffness, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) with multivariable adjustment. We also performed stratification analysis by age and sex. The median (interquartile range) for BPA was 0.81 (0.48, 1.45) ng/ mL, which is notably lower than previously reported in the United States and other Western countries. Urinary BPA concentrations were negatively associated with hypertension (multivariable-adjusted OR for the highest versus lowest BPA quartile \u00bc 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46, 0.80), elevated CIMT (OR \u00bc 0.64; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.87), and arterial stiffness (OR \u00bc 0.62; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.87). The corresponding OR for PAD (60 cases total) was not significant (OR \u00bc 0.89; 95% CI: 0.28, 2.80). The negative associations of BPA with hypertension, elevated CIMT, and arterial stiffness were consistent by age and sex stratifications, and were stronger among participants !60 versus <60 years of age, and among women than men. In contrast with previous investigations, our study suggests negative associations of BPA exposure with hypertension and early macrovascular diseases among middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Future investigations are needed to draw more definite conclusions and generalize to other populations.

            "text": "B isphenol A (BPA) is one of the world's most widely manufactured chemicals, with more than 2.2 million tons produced each year. 1,2 Human population is widely and continuously exposed to BPA through food, drinking water, dermal exposures and inhalation of dusts. Detectable urinary BPA levels have been found to be present in 93% to 95% of children and adults in national surveys conducted in United States. 3,4 BPA is considered as an environmental endocrine disruptor. [5][6][7] Experimental and epidemiological studies have suggested that BPA exposure may be related to diabetes, [7][8][9] cardiovascular disease, 8 thyroid disease, 10,11 obesity, and insulin resistance. 5,6,12,13 Hypertension is a major public health problem worldwide and is a core risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Macrovascular complications are major target organ damages in hypertension. 14 The markers of the deterioration of macrovascular structure and function, such as carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV), and Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI), are predictors for cardiovascular disease. [15][16][17] Recent epidemiological studies have reported that higher levels of urinary BPA were associated with hypertension, 18,19 cardiovascular disease, 8 coronary, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). 20,21 Urinary BPA levels in Chinese adults are notably lower than those reported in the United States. 4,9,22 Until recently, no previous study to our knowledge has examined the relationships of urinary BPA levels with hypertension and early macrovascular diseases in Chinese population. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between urinary BPA levels, a marker of BPA exposure, and hypertension and early macrovascular diseases in Chinese adults.",

The concentrations of urinary BPA (median value, 0.81 ng/mL; IQR, 0.48-1.45 ng/ mL) in the present study were low relative to concentrations in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort study (median value, 1.3 ng/mL), 20 which reported a positive association between BPA and coronary artery disease in a dose-response manner in a longitudinal analysis. Urinary BPA concentrations in our study population also were lower than concentrations reported for other recent study populations (available median values range from 1.20 to 2.30 ng/mL, available mean values range from 1.79 to 6.93 ng/mL). 8,[18][19][20][21]29 Different from the Korean study, in the present study, the associations between BPA and hypertension, elevated CIMT and arterial stiffness were negative and in doseresponse relationship. The most current study by Bae and Hong reported that consuming canned beverage and consequent increase of BPA exposure increased blood pressure acutely in 60 participants (56 women and 4 men) ages 60 years or older. It is an interesting study revealing a relationship between shortterm BPA exposure and acute effect on blood pressure. 30 The association of chronic BPA exposure with cardiovascular risk is still to be evaluated in further longitudinal study.",

[32][33][34] It is well-documented that estrogen improves vascular function and reduces atherosclerosis. 32 Experimental studies of mice have indicated that the atheroprotection is mediated by estrogen receptor-a and b, 35,36 which have important roles in repairing blood vessels and controlling blood pressure. 31,36 Estrogen is also important for maintaining and repairing the endothelium. This process appears to involve an estrogen mediated increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase. 34 In humans, the incidence of cardiovascular disease differs widely among men and women, partly because of the variations in hormones. 37 Studies have found that the incidence of cardiovascular disease is usually low in premenopausal women and tends to increase in postmenopausal women, however, in postmenopausal women who receive estrogen therapy, the incidence can be reduced to premenopausal levels. [37][38][39] Thus it is biologically possible that exogenous estrogen may have protective effects on hypertension and early macrovascular diseases.",

Firstly, due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, we cannot establish that BPA exposure precedes hypertension and early macrovascular diseases. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the chronic effect of BPA exposure on health outcomes. Secondly, we did not collect data on diet behavior, and the specific hypertension medication categories or dose. Thus, confounding by diet or medication cannot be ruled out. Thirdly, the BPA measures are from single spot urine samples, repeated measurements over weeks, months, or even years would improve the evaluation of a long-term exposure. Mahalingaiah et al 42 measured urinary BPA concentrations in 217 samples collected over weeks to months from 82 participants attending a fertility clinic in the United States. The authors reported that 63% of participants classified into the highest tertile of the geometric mean concentration of all samples would have been correctly classified based on a single urine sample. Fourthly, due to a generally lower level of BPA exposure in this population, it might be less likely to detect any possibly positive association between BPA and cardiovascular risk than in a population with a wider range of possible exposure levels. Fifthly, our study participants were restricted to middle-aged and elderly Chinese population. Therefore, age, race, and the BPA exposure levels should be considered when generalizing the findings to other populations. Further studies in prospective cohorts are warranted to verify our findings in other demographic or ethnic populations.",
