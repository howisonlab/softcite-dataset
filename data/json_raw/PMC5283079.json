We developed an ex vivo rabbit model and an in vivo mouse model of infectious keratitis. A bioluminescent strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used as the causative pathogen, allowing noninvasive monitoring of the extent of infection in real time via bioluminescence imaging. Quantitation of bacterial luminescence was correlated to colonyforming units (CFU). Using the ex vivo and in vivo models, the effectiveness of aBL (415 nm) for the treatment of keratitis was evaluated as a function of radiant exposure when aBL was delivered at 6 or 24 hours after bacterial inoculation. The aBL exposures calculated to reach the retina were compared to the American National Standards Institute standards to estimate aBL retinal safety. RESULTS. Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis fully developed in both the ex vivo and in vivo models at 24 hours post inoculation. Bacterial luminescence in the infected corneas correlated linearly to CFU (R 2 \u00bc 0.921). Bacterial burden in the infected corneas was rapidly and significantly reduced (>2-log 10) both ex vivo and in vivo after a single exposure of aBL. Recurrence of infection was observed in the aBL-treated mice at 24 hours after aBL exposure. The aBL toxicity to the retina is largely dependent on the aBL transmission of the cornea. CONCLUSIONS. Antimicrobial blue light is a potential alternative or adjunctive therapeutic for infectious keratitis. Further studies of corneal and retinal safety using large animal models, in which the ocular anatomies are similar to that of humans, are warranted.",

            "text": "I nfectious keratitis is a potentially blinding ocular condition of the cornea. According to a recent report released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), each year in the United States there are approximately 1 million clinical visits for keratitis, translating into an estimated total cost of $175 million per year. 1 The risk factors for infectious keratitis include ocular trauma, contact lens wear, recent ocular surgery, preexisting ocular surface disease, dry eyes, lid deformity, corneal sensational impairment, chronic use of topical steroids, and systemic immunosuppression. 2 The common causative pathogens of infectious keratitis are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, [2][3][4][5] Staphylococcus aureus, 2,[5][6][7] Streptococcus pneumonia, 8,9 and Fusarium solani. 10,11 Treatment of infectious keratitis must be rapidly instituted to minimize the destruction of corneal tissue, limit the extent of corneal scarring, and prevent vision loss. The current standard of care for the treatment of infectious keratitis is the use of topical or systemic antibiotics. 12,13 However, the clinical management of keratitis has been significantly complicated by the increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. [2][3][4][5][6][7][8]11,14 Pathogens replicate rapidly, and a mutation that helps a pathogen survive in the presence of antibiotic(s) will quickly become predominant throughout the microbial population, rendering infections that cannot be treated with available antibiotics. There is, consequently, a pressing need for the development of alternative treatment regimens to tackle drug resistance in infectious keratitis.",

The wavelengths in aBL are absorbed by the chromophores in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (e.g., proteins in photoreceptor cells, flavin proteins, heme proteins, melanosomes), and subsequently may produce both photothermal and photochemical damage. 25 Using the formula described by Delori et al., 26 we calculated the aBL exposures to reach the retina with the aBL treatment parameters that reduced the bacterial luminescence in the ex vivo rabbit model by approximately 3-log 10 (84 J/cm 2 for 6 hours post inoculation and 304 J/cm 2 for 24 hours post inoculation; see Fig. 3). The initial calculation assumed that the cornea was clear (100% transmission), and subsequent calculations assumed partial cloudiness that decreased the aBL transmission by 50% and 90%. The obtained aBL exposures to reach the retina were compared to the safety thresholds for photothermal and photochemical damage previously established by experimental studies. 19 The retinal aBL exposure was calculated for corneal irradiance \u00bc 100 mW/cm 2 and pupil diameter \u00bc 2 mm, and a 10-mm retinal image diameter was assumed. For a clear cornea (100% transmission), the retinal aBL exposure exceeds the retinal safety threshold (i.e., is unsafe) by factors of 1.43 and 5.13 for 84 and 304 J/cm 2 aBL, respectively. For a cloudy cornea that blocks 50% of the aBL, 84 J/cm 2 aBL delivered to the cornea is below the retina safety threshold by a factor of 1.4 (i.e., 1/1.4 \u00bc 0.71-fold of the retina safety threshold), but 304 J/cm 2 is above the threshold by a factor of 2.53. If a very cloudy cornea only transmits 10% of the aBL, 84 and 304 J/cm 2 aBL are below the limit by factors of 7.13 and 2.03, respectively.",

Our results demonstrated that a single exposure of aBL rapidly and significantly reduced bacterial burden in both the ex vivo and in vivo models. The infections treated at 24 hours post inoculation were more resistant to aBL than they were at 6 hours post inoculation. The possible reason is that, at 24 hours post inoculation, infections had fully established and bacteria existed predominantly as biofilms. 27 The biofilm matrix could block aBL and render bacterial cells less susceptible to aBL. Other investigators reported the effectiveness of aBL (420 nm) against bacterial biofilms. 28 Additionally, when infections had fully established, bacteria might have proliferated into the deeper layers of the corneal tissue (as shown in Fig. 2B), where the aBL transmission was further attenuated. In a previous study of aBL therapy for P. aeruginosa burn infection in mice, we observed that, when aBL was applied 30 minutes post inoculation, an average 3.5-log 10 inactivation of P. aeruginosa in mouse burns was achieved when an exposure of 55.8 J/cm 2 aBL had been delivered.",

One possible reason of infection recurrence is that bacteria in the infected corneas were not completely eradicated after aBL exposure even when bacterial luminescence was eliminated due to the sensitivity limitation of the bioluminescence imaging system (>10 2 CFU). Another possible reason is that part of the corneal area was shielded by eyelids and this prevented aBL from irradiating this area, rendering the shielded area actually untreated. The bacteria surviving from the aBL exposure subsequently induced recurrence of infection. This hypothesis was supported by the results obtained from the study using the ex vivo rabbit corneas. In the ex vivo study, the whole area of excised rabbit corneas was exposed to aBL and no bacterial regrowth was found in any aBL-treated cornea after aBL exposure. Several approaches could be considered to improve the effectiveness of aBL therapy, such as repeated aBL treatments (two or three times) and combined therapy using aBL and subtherapeutic dose of antibiotics (antimicrobial eye drops), which can reach the corneal area under the eyelids after topical application.",

The arrangement of corneal collagen and the properties of corneal epithelial cells also differ between mice and humans, 32,33 which could produce alternate reactions of the cornea to invading pathogens. Descemet's and Bowman's membranes are substantially thinner in mice than in humans, 32,34 and mouse corneas have a higher ratio of corneal epithelial cells to stroma than humans and more cell layers in the corneal epithelium. 31,32 All of these anatomic differences have an effect on aBL delivery, bacterial adherence and possible invasion, susceptibility to bacterial enzymes and other virulence factors, and availability of host defense molecules in the tear film.

(A) Time course for the bacterial luminescence intensity of ex vivo rabbit eyes infected with 2 3 10 6 CFU of P. aeruginosa (solid line; n \u00bc 6). Successive bacterial luminescence images are shown from a representative infected ex vivo rabbit eye. The pseudo-color scale bar indicates the bioluminescence intensity value of a single pixel in the bioluminescence images. (B) Gram-stained (320) and H&E-stained histologic sections (310) of representative ex vivo rabbit eyes infected with 2 3 10 6 CFU of P. aeruginosa and sampled at 3, 6, and 24 hours after bacterial inoculation. The Gram stain demonstrated the presence of P. aeruginosa in the corneal tissue, with bacteria invaded deeper into the corneal tissue over this time period. The areas in the depicted boxes in 310 H&E images are shown in 320 Gram images. The areas in the depicted boxes in 320 Gram images are illustrated in the insets of 3100 oil lens images. (C) Time course for the bacterial luminescence intensity of in vivo mouse eyes infected with 5 3 10 5 CFU of P. aeruginosa (solid line; n \u00bc 6). Bars: standard deviation. The inset shows the bacterial luminescence images and photographs taken at 0, 24, 36, and 72 hours post inoculation from a representative infected in vivo mouse eye. The pseudo-color scale bar indicates the bioluminescence intensity value of a single pixel in the bioluminescence images.",
