Materials and Methods: The modified method outlined by Puig et al. 2013 was used to conduct Calyculin A and Okadaic acid induced PCC assay in human blood lymphocytes. Chemical treatment was given for the last 1 h of a 48 h culture. The study was carried out in the dose range 2.5 to 20 Gy using 60 Co gamma rays and 8 MeV pulsed electron beam. Results and Conclusions: Results show a linear dose dependent increase with a slope of 0.047 \u00b1 0.001 from Calycalin A PCC and 0.048 \u00b1 0.002 form Okadaic acid PCC. The slope of the fragments curve was 0.327 \u00b1 0.006 from Calyculin A and 0.328 \u00b1 0.006 from Okadaic acid PCC. Further, dose calibration studies were carried out for 8 MeV electron using Calyculin A PCC assay and the obtained slope from ring yield was 0.054 \u00b1 0.002 and 0.427 \u00b1 0.009 from fragment yield.",

            "text": "The conventional cytogenetic dosimetry, the gold standard chromosomal aberration assay, fails to estimate high radiation dose exposure due to mitotic delay and severe leukopenia. Therefore, it is not always possible to make chromosome preparations containing a sufficient number of metaphase cells necessary for the dose estimation. Hence, there is a need to establish a reliable, easier, and quicker method for biodosimetry, which depends on interphase chromosomes. When cycling cells enter mitosis, the chromatin condenses into chromosomes. Techniques have been developed to cause chromatin to condense at earlier stages in the cell cycle (before mitosis) and dose estimation can be done by measuring ring frequency. The technique is termed as the Premature Chromosome Condensation (PCC) assay. The PCC assay was first reported by Johnson and Rao in 1970 1) . The premature condensation was induced by fusing the interphase cells to mitotic CHO or HeLa cells using Sendai virus or polyethylene glycol (PEG) as fusing agents. Fusion by means of Sendai virus requires cells with membranes, especially receptive to the virus particles. G0lymphocytes cannot be satisfactorily fused using Sendai virus. This difficulty was overcome for the purpose of biological dosimetry with the use of PEG for PCC induction. However, this fusion method has several disadvantages, such as complicated operation, low PCC index, and the requirement of mitotic and fusing cells. In 1993, Dyban et al. 2) reported that Okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A phosphoprotein phosphatases, induced PCC in mouse embryo cells. Furthermore, Gotoh et al. 3) reported that PCC was also inducible by the protein phosphatise Calyculin A in many types of cells with high efficiency. In addition, Kanda et al. 4 ) reported the dose response relationship of PCC rings in lymphocytes and proposed an easy method of scoring PCC rings in Giemsa stained PCC spreads induced by Okadaic acid (OA). They also estimated the doses in three Tokaimura criticality accident victims using this assay 5 ) . Recently, many groups used chemically induced PCC assay for dose estimation [6][7][8][9][10] . The present study deals with standardization of CalyculinA and Okadaic acid induced PCC assay, and dose response studies with 60 Co gamma rays in the dose range 0 to 20 Gy. The study also involves standardization CalyculinA induced PCC assay for 8 MeV pulsed electron beam.",

The peripheral blood lymphocytes were incubated for 2 h at 37 before and after irradiation for repair. Ficoll Histopaque density gradient method was used to separate lymphocytes from whole blood cells. Blood lymphocyte cultures were set up with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FCS and 0.2 ml of PHA (final concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml) and incubated 37 for 48 h. One hour before harvesting i.e., after 47 h of incubation, cultures were centrifuged, culture volume was adjusted to 2.5 cm 3 , and Calyculin A (50 nM) or Okadaic acid (500 nM) was added to the culture. After about 1 h of incubation with the drug, cultures were harvested and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 8 min to get a firm pellet with a clear supernatant. Supernatant was discarded and a pellet was disturbed and mixed thoroughly using a vertex. Pre-warmed (37 ) hypotonic solution (0.075 M KCl) was added to the pellet with constant vortex mixing. The pellets in the hypotonic solution were incubated at 37 for 6 min in a pre-warmed water bath and then centrifuged at 900 rpm for 8 min. The cells were fixed by cold fixative solution with 1: 3 mixtures of acetic acid and methanol after removing the supernatant and gentle agitation. To prepare the chromosome spread on slides, the cells were mixed thoroughly and dropped on a precleaned frozen slide from a certain height (~30 cm) followed by quick warm and air blow on the slide surface to get better spread of metaphase chromosomes. The slides were stained using giemsa stain for 10 to 12 min by dipping in staining solution and washing 3 to 4 times with a d.d.w. The slides were mounted with a cover slip using Deepex before scoring. PCC spreads were analyzed at 100X magnification with an Olympus BX 51 fluorescent microscope coupled to a Jenoptik C5 cooled CCD camera with ProgRes Capture Pro 2.8 software. 100rings per dose were scored. Two scoring criteria were used; one as suggested by Kanda et al. 4 ) , which includes all spherical shaped PCC rings, and another suggested by Lamadrid et al. 18) , which strictly limits ring evaluation to those which clearly defined open space. Extra fragments were recorded as those exceeding 46 pieces in G2/M PCC cells and 92 pieces in case of M/A PCC cells. For each ring, one fragment was not considered as extra fragment. For curve fitting, the minimum Chi-square method using Origin package was used. The distribution of PCC rings were analyzed by Papworth's u test 19 ) . The detailed statistical analysis is given elsewhere 20 ) . Briefly, the mean number of observed rings per cell (y) is given for each dose (D) along with relative variance (\u03c3 2 /y) and the dispersion index (u).

            "text": "The results show a linear dose dependent increase in centric rings, excess fragments frequency for gamma radiation in Calyculin A and Okadaic acid induced premature chromosomes. From Table 1 and 2, it may be noted that the u-values for the studied doses are between \u00b1 1.96, which confirms that the ring frequency follows a Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is a characteristic feature of low LET radiation exposure. Many investigators have reported perfect Poisson distribution of ring frequency for low LET radiation in vitro 6,7,9,10,21 ) . Since ring and fragment yield varies linearly with the dose, results were fit to a linear model and the coefficients of the linear model are shown in Table 3. The obtained \u03b1 value, when rings are considered, were found to be 0.047 \u00b1 0.001 Gy -1 from Calycalin A PCC and 0.048 \u00b1 0.002 Gy -1 form Okadaic acid PCC, which are comparable with the reported results. Recently, Romero et al. 9) obtained an \u03b1 value of 0.044 \u00b1 0.0012 Gy -1 from Calycalin A PCC, which is comparable with the present results. The \u03b1 value reported by Puig et al. 10 ) and Lindhom et al. 7) was 0.027 \u00b1 0.003 Gy -1 and 0.021 \u00b1 0.01 Gy -1 , respectively, which are lower  values compared to the present study. The less \u03b1 value in their case may be because of the combined treatment of colcemid and Calyculin A. In the present study, the obtained \u03b1 value from Okadaic acid PCC was 0.048 \u00b1 0.002 Gy -1 , which is comparable with the \u03b1 value reported by Daniela et al. 6 ) (0.0489 \u00b1 0.006 Gy -1 ), Lindhom et al. 7 ) (0.049 \u00b1 0.01 Gy -1 ) and Balakrishnan et al. 8) (0.054 \u00b1 0.01 Gy -1 ). From Fig. 1 and 2, it is clear that there is no significant difference between Calyculin A and Okadaic acid PCC curves. The slope of the fragments curve is 0.327 \u00b1 0.006 Gy -1 from Calyculin A and 0.328 \u00b1 0.006 Gy -1 from Okadaic acid PCC. The fragments curve slopes are slightly less compared to the reported results, 0.41 \u00b1 0.04 Gy -1 by Puig et al. 10) and 0.45 \u00b1 0.03 Gy -1 by Balakrishnan et al 8) . The fragments slope may be less because of more G2/M PCC cells observed in this study. The percentage of PCC spreads induced by Calyculin A and Okadaic acid at various doses of gamma radiation was calculated and presented in Table 4. The percentage of PCC spread was calculated using following equation. The observed PCC spread (%) was much higher in Calyculin A compared to Okadaic acid PCC assay. From Table 4, it may be noted that the increase in G2/M PCC spreads until 7.5 Gy followed by a plateau, whereas decrease in M/A PCC spreads with the radiation dose. A similar observation was reported by Miura et al. 22 ) , who observed an increase in G2/M PCC spread until 8 Gy and thereafter it attained a plateau and decrease in M/A PCC cells. A higher PCC index was observed for Calyculin A compare to Okadaic acid, which restricted 8 MeV electron studies on Calyculin A. The results show a linear dose dependent increase in centric rings and excess fragments frequency, and the ring distribution follows the Possion distribution ( Fig. 4 and 5). A similar dose response relation was observed in gamma radiation studies. The dose response relation can be represented as, Ycentric rings = (0.054 \u00b1 0.002) D (with R 2 = 0.99 and P <0.0001) and Yfragments = ( 0.427 \u00b1 0.009 ) D ( with R 2 = 0.99 and P <0.0001). From Fig. 4 and 5, it is clear that there is a significant difference in ring yield and fragment yield between 8 MeV electrons and 60 Co-gamma radiation. The obtained \u03b1 value for ring yield is 0.047 \u00b1 0.001 Gy -1 for gamma radiation and 0.054 \u00b1 0.002 Gy -1 for 8 MeV electrons. The \u03b1 values from fragment yield is 0.327 \u00b1 0.006 Gy -1 for gamma radiation and 0.427 \u00b1 0.009 Gy -1 for 8 MeV electrons. The obtained higher \u03b1 values for electron beam may be because of higher RBE value of the radiation. The higher RBE values of the 8 MeV electron beam have been reported elsewhere 15,20,23) .",
