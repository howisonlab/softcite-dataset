We find only 13 studies for seven countries published between 2000 and 2014 which assess the insurance impacts for children, controlling for self-selection and heterogeneity. Nine out of 10 studies reviewed provide consistent evidence that health insurance provides financial protection. The results are more mixed for health utilisation and health outcomes. Policy-makers would benefit from additional research on whether and how health insurance benefits children.",

            "text": "This review centres on the effects of health insurance programs in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) on the health and health-care outcomes for children. The health of children is widely understood as an inherently important component of their wellbeing and instrumental in promoting their productivity as adults (Behrman & Rosenzweig, 2004). Populations in many parts of the world are young, especially in LMICs. For instance, in Africa, children under age 15 account for 41 per cent of the population (United Nations, 2015). The health of children is therefore central to global human, economic and social development. This was reflected in the explicit identification of child health as a key component of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and in the more recent Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs; United Nations Development Programme, 2016).",

The rate of mortality for children under the age of 5 worldwide almost halved over the period 1990-2013 (Sepulveda & Murray, 2014;Wang et al., 2014). However, the reduction fell short of the targeted two-thirds in the MDGs. Progress on maternal health has been less impressive, with only one-third of the targeted reduction rate in maternal mortality rate achieved (26 per cent, compared to 75 per cent). Diseases remain a substantial cause of preventable child deaths. In 2013, malaria, lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea collectively accounted for approximately one-third of childhood deaths.

While UHC is currently very high on the global health agenda, the road to achieving it is far from straightforward. Currently little consensus exists on how LMICs should structure their reforms to move towards UHC (Lagomarsino et al., 2012). There are multiple ways to increase the funds available to health care, including taxation, health insurance, out-ofpocket payments and innovative mechanisms such as external donor assistance (WHO, 2010). In reality, countries employ a mix of these strategies. It is generally agreed that out-of-pocket payments are a regressive form of health financing with harmful consequences for the poor. WHO (2010) makes strong policy recommendations to reduce direct payments for health care through risk pooling and prepayment for people who can afford to pay, either through taxation and/or insurance contributions (WHO, 2010).",

            "text": "Health insurance has become an important mechanism through which many LMICs are committing to UHC. Systems typically comprise a collection of contributory and non-contributory schemes targeted to a range of population groups. Most systems include all or a combination of the following: a compulsory contributory scheme for civil servants and formal sector employees; a non-contributory scheme for social beneficiary groups such as the poor and persons with disabilities; and a voluntary contributory scheme for informal sector workers and anyone else willing to pay a private premium. In theory, through the collection of premiums from the non-poor, the system is able to subsidise premiums for the poor or nearpoor. However in practice, premiums collected from the formal sector in LMICs are insufficient and states commonly subsidise the premiums of voluntary schemes. Yet the take-up is often low, as demonstrated by the case of Vietnam where approximately 40 per cent of the population remains uninsured, the majority of whom are people working in the informal sector. 1 Thailand represents a unique case where since 2001, premiums for the informal sector have been paid fully out of the state budget with enrollees subject to a 30 baht co-payment, making it the first LMIC to achieve UHC. In most instances, schemes are publicly provided. India presents an exception, with significant efforts being made to expand the private insurance system alongside state governmentsponsored health insurance schemes (La Forgia & Nagpal, 2012). 2 Schemes may be provided at the national or community level, with the former seemingly most common.",

There are schemes that specifically target children and schemes for the general population under which children may become eligible, such as non-contributory schemes for the poor or as dependants of compulsory contributory schemes. Many countries have expanded health insurance coverage to school-aged children through targeted non-contributory programs. For instance, in 1992, Egypt introduced its School Health Insurance Programme, which provided free health insurance to children of primary school age (Yip & Berman, 2001). The Philippines expanded insurance coverage among school-age children seeking care in 30 randomly selected treatment sites (Quimbo et al., 2011). In Vietnam, by contrast, school-aged children were included among 'voluntary' insurance target groups yet were strongly encouraged by schools to pay the state-subsidised private premium. Later, in 2005, preschool-aged (<6 years) children in Vietnam became eligible for non-contributory health insurance. It is also common for children to be included in non-contributory health insurance programs targeted to mothers and their children. For example, Colombia created its Contributive and Subsidised Regimes of insurance coverage during the 1990s, which provided generous benefits to mothers and their newborns (Camacho & Conover, 2013). Bolivia established its National Maternal and Child Insurance before expanding it into a national public health insurance program. Similarly, Malawi introduced maternal and newborn health insurance in 2004 in response to the MDGs (Brenner et al., 2014).",

There is a clear need for a review of the impact of health insurance programs on children, given the central role of the health of children to human development, and because a number of countries have implemented reforms to expand health insurance coverage through programs targeted at children (e.g. Vietnam). The demand for health care for children may have a different price elasticity than that for adults (Leibowitz et al., 1985;Sauerborn et al., 1994;Ching, 1995), which may lead to different effects for children than for adults. To our knowledge, this article is the first systematic and comprehensive examination of the effect of health insurance on utilisation, financial protection and health outcomes for children in LMICs. It aims to inform future research and interventions related to UHC in general, and for children in particular. We limit our review to studies that apply rigorous impact evaluation methods as those that best inform evidence-based policy. Studies were identified based upon an extensive search of bibliographic databases covering published articles in health services research, medical and social sciences journals. We provide a theoretical and empirical background for the study, then organise and synthesise results before discussing the findings and their implications for future research.",

A simple comparison of means for the insured and the uninsured using observational data does not help, since health insurance coverage is not random, but rather the outcome of demand and supply factors, some of which are a function of health status and individual or household preferences. A simple comparison would give biased estimates: it would reflect the causal effect of health insurance combined with the effect of unmeasured characteristics that are correlated with health insurance coverage. The direction of the bias due to unobserved heterogeneity is unclear. It could be positive due to adverse selection. Children in worse health are more likely to demand health insurance, but also to demand more health care. The bias could be negative when health insurance programs are made available to children who are likely to be healthier, such as children enrolled in school. An additional challenge is that health insurance expansions could be part of broader health sector reforms that simultaneously affect the supply and demand side of health care, which makes it difficult to isolate the effect of health insurance.",

The study showed little difference in the health outcomes of participants who received free care compared to those who paid a share of their health care.

The characteristics of each of these programs are presented in Appendix Table A1. An overview of these articles is given in Table 1 and each of them is synthesised in Table 2. Results in Tables 2-4 are first listed for programs targeted at children and then for other programs. Seven out of 13 papers are concerned with health insurance expansion for the general population in Burkina Faso (Fink et al., 2013), China (Wagstaff & Yu, 2007;Chen & Jin, 2012), Colombia (Giedion & Uribe, 2009;Miller et al., 2013), Rwanda (Lu et al., 2012), and Thailand (Gruber et al., 2014). Five papers cover health insurance programs targeted at children in the Philippines (Kraft et al., 2009;Quimbo et al., 2011) and Vietnam (Wagstaff & Pradhan, 2005;Nguyen & Wang, 2013;Guindon, 2014;Palmer et al., 2015). It should be noted that one paper (Guindon, 2014) deals with both a program targeted at children and a program for a larger population. 4 With respect to methodology, three articles used a difference-in-difference design (Nguyen & Wang, 2013;Gruber et al., 2014;Guindon, 2014), one paper used propensity score matching (Lu et al., 2012), four papers used difference-indifference and propensity score matching combined (Wagstaff & Pradhan, 2005;Wagstaff & Yu, 2007;Giedion & Uribe, 2009;Chen & Jin, 2012), three papers used a randomised controlled trial (Kraft et al., 2009;Quimbo et al., 2011;Fink et al., 2013), and two papers used a regression discontinuity design (Miller et al., 2013;Palmer et al., 2015).     The studies use a variety of outcomes: ten studies have service utilisation outcomes, nine have financial protection outcomes, and ten have health outcomes. It should be noted that in these studies, utilisation and health outcomes are measured at the child level, while financial protection is typically measured at the household level. Only three studies pay attention to subgroups of children or their households: Giedion and Uribe (2009) among urban, rural, poorest and poor quintiles; Wagstaff and Pradhan (2005) and Wagstaff and Yu (2007) by income quintile.",

For instance, for Colombia, Giedion and Uribe (2009) find that the likelihood that a child gets immunised and that a child with a cough visits a health-care facility were 6.1 per cent and 10.7 per cent greater respectively for those under the insurance program (Giedion & Uribe, 2009). For Thailand, Gruber et al. (2014) show that the '30 Baht' program led to a 12 per cent increase in inpatient health service utilisation for the overall population during its first 4 years. For infants (0-1 years of age) and women of child-bearing age service utilisation grew 2.5 times faster. In the Philippines, Kraft et al. (2009) find that delays in seeking care were 5.3 per cent lower in health insurance intervention sites than compared to control sites.",

Wagstaff and Yu (2007) have mixed results on the impact of the World Bank's Health VIII project in Gansu province, China, on the use of health services. For instance, it leads to an increase in hepatitis B immunisation at the county level, but has a negative impact on immunisations overall at the village level (this latter result is sensitive to the econometric specification). For the case of Vietnam, Wagstaff and Pradhan (2005) find for the Voluntary Health Insurance program that the probability of contact with a health-care provider for a sick person increases for children 5 and over, but not for children under 5. Guindon (2014) finds that Vietnam's health insurance program for children under 6 increases outpatient visits by 17 per cent but has no significant effect on inpatient admissions, while Nguyen and Wang (2013) find for the very same program a significant increase in inpatient care but no significant change in outpatient care. Both Guindon (2014) and Nguyen and Wang (2013) use difference-indifference estimation strategies and the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey. However, they use different control groups, which may explain the difference in results. Using an alternative regression discontinuity design, Palmer et al. (2015) find a positive utilisation impact for both inpatient and outpatient services. Consistent with Guindon (2014), the authors find a larger impact on outpatient service utilisation.",

Financial protection is measured through catastrophic health spending and/or out-of-pocket health expenditures, and the variability of medical spending (Table 3). Catastrophic spending is understood as a level of health-care expenditures that exceeds a given threshold of income, which is typically proxied by consumption expenditures as a more permanent measure of income in LMICs settings. Thresholds and consumption expenditure types vary from study to study. For instance, Wagstaff and Yu (2007) define it as spending exceeding 10 per cent of total consumption expenditures, which is the most commonly used threshold when total expenditure is used as the denominator. In addition, one has to bear in mind that financial protection is usually measured at the household level. In the case of householdlevel outcomes, for insurance programs targeted at children, a lack of change in expenditures, for instance, could be due to a redistribution of expenditures towards uninsured individuals in the household. Results thus need to be interpreted with caution.",

Nine out of 10 studies reviewed in this paper provide consistent evidence that health insurance provides financial protection. The results are more mixed when it comes to health-care utilisation and health outcomes: a positive effect was found in six out of 10 studies for health-care utilisation and in four out of 10 studies for health outcomes.

The general synthesis of results for the 13 studies is that insurance helps with financial protection while providing mixed impact on utilisation and health outcomes for children. This stands in contrast to results of other reviews. For instance, Giedion et al. (2013), considering broadly universal health care, finds that insurance tends to increase levels of utilisation across all services but has little to no impact on financial protection. For the informal sector, Acharya et al. (2013) find no evidence that health insurance in the informal sector impacts utilisation, financial protection and health outcomes.",

Two studies in Vietnam found a larger impact of health insurance on the use of outpatient relative to inpatient care for children under the age of 6 (Nguyen et al., 2012;Palmer et al., 2015). This finding is consistent with the RAND experiment where co-payments did not affect the probability of an inpatient visit of children (Manning et al., 1987). Improved access to primary and preventative care such as immunisations through outpatient contacts may have led to a reduction in the probability of hospitalisation for insured younger children. These services are also typically better covered than inpatient services under insurance, which may explain negative impacts on the financial burden of accessing care.",

In addition, three studies assess Vietnam's health insurance program for children under age 6 using the same data but different methods. They return findings that are somewhat different on health-care utilisation and financial protection. For instance, Palmer et al.

These different results for Vietnam's programs contrast with those from a review of the literature in the United States where studies with different methods lead to similar results (Buchmueller et al., 2005).",

The greatest limitation relates to the small number of robust studies on the topic. More research is needed that evaluates the impact of health insurance programs on children in LMICs, as many countries are adopting or are considering adopting health insurance programs, or are broadly moving towards universal health care. The findings of the review are of course constrained by the limitations of the studies in the literature. Many studies on the impact of universal health insurance programs in LMICs do not present separate results for children and thus did not meet the search criteria of this review (e.g. Jowett et al., 2003;Axelson et al., 2009;Wagstaff, 2010;Nguyen, 2011). This represents a missed opportunity to understand the healthseeking behaviours and health outcomes of this important subpopulation. More research is needed that evaluates the impact of health insurance programs targeted at children, and studies that assess the impact of insurance programs for all ages need to separate out effects on children.",

In three studies, the comparison is not possible because different utilisation or health outcome indicators are used for children (e.g. immunisations completed). When generic indicators are used (e.g. number of inpatient or outpatient visits), studies should, when possible, break down results for adults and children due to potentially different health-careseeking behaviours as well as the inherent importance of child health to human development.",

Results suggest that supply-side considerations are important factors influencing the consequences of health insurance reforms on children. For instance, Gruber et al. (2014) find that increased funding of hospitals for the poor, and reduced copayments, increased health-care utilisation, especially among the poor and reduced infant mortality in poorer provinces in Thailand.

They tend to be short-term outcomes and come from general household survey data that are collected for purposes other than studying health care and health insurance. They often lack details on insurance plans, health-care services and health status. For instance, regarding inpatient care, we found several studies that examine the effects of insurance on any hospital utilisation by children. However, these studies do not differentiate between avoidable and unavoidable inpatient care, as has sometimes been done in the literature in high-income countries (Buchmueller et al., 2005). Some of the mixed results on the impact of health insurance on care utilisation and health outcomes are perhaps due to the limited information available in standard household surveys. For instance, measures of any contact with a health provider in the past year are crude measures of health-care utilisation, and these may explain the Wagstaff and Pradhan (2005) finding that availability of health care has no effect for children under 5. Mortality used in some studies may be too crude a measure of health to capture health improvements that may result from health insurance and may explain why Chen and Jin (2012) and Fink et al. (2013) find no effect on under-5 mortality.",
