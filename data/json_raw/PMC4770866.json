            "text": "Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), a widely used adult stem cell candidate for regenerative medicine, has been shown to exert some of its therapeutic effects through the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). These homogenously sized EVs of 100\u00c1150 hm exhibited many exosome-like biophysical and biochemical properties and carry both proteins and RNAs. Recently, exosome-associated proteins in this MSC EV preparation were found to segregate primarily to those EVs that bind cholera toxin B chain (CTB), a GM1 ganglioside-specific ligand, and pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that these EVs have endosomal origin and carried many of the exosome-associated markers. Here, we report that only a fraction of the MSC EV proteome was found in CTB-bound EVs. Using Annexin V (AV) and Shiga toxin B subunit (ST) with affinities for phosphatidylserine and globotriaosylceramide, respectively, AV-and a ST-binding EV were identified. CTB-, AV-and ST\u00c1binding EVs all carried actin. However, the AV-binding EVs carried low or undetectable levels of the exosome-associated proteins. Only the ST-binding EVs carried RNA and EDA-containing fibronectin. Proteins in AV-binding EVs were also different from those released by apoptotic MSCs. CTB-and AV-binding activities were localized to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of MSCs, while ST-binding activity was localized to the nucleus. Together, this study demonstrates that cells secrete many types of EVs. Specifically, MSCs secrete at least 3 types. They can be differentially isolated based on their affinities for membrane lipidbinding ligands. As the subcellular sites of the binding activities of these ligands and cargo load are different for each EV type, they are likely to have a different biogenesis pathway and possibly different functions.",

            "text": "esenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells that can be prepared from both adult and foetal tissues, or differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). They are the most widely used regenerative stem cell candidate with nearly 500 MSC clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov/; accessed May 2015). The advantages of MSCs are their ease of isolation from many adult tissues (1), prolific ex vivo expansion capacity and a diverse differentiation potential. MSC-based cell therapies have generally been proven to be clinically safe. The mechanism of action underpinning the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs remains controversial but has been increasingly attributed to their secretion, which is thought to reduce cellular injury and enhance repair.",

They carried exosome-associated proteins such as the tetraspanin proteins CD9 and CD81, ALIX, TSG101 and RNAs of less than 300 nt (4). Based on these characteristics, these particles were identified as exosomes, a specific type of extracellular vesicle (EV). Subsequent analysis including pulse-chase experiments confirmed that the tetraspanin proteins CD9 and CD81, and endosomal markers ALIX and TSG101, were associated primarily with EVs that bind cholera toxin B chain (CTB), and that these CTBbinding EVs were derived from endosomes. They were also enriched in GM1 gangliosides, which are the endogenous receptors for CTB (5).",

This suggests that the exosome preparation may contain other EV types. For clarity, our previously reported MSC exosome preparation will be referred to as an MSC EV preparation in this report. To isolate other EVs, we determined whether other membrane lipidbinding ligands could extract the remaining EVs from MSC secretion, and whether these extracted EVs contain unique cargos of proteins and RNA. The rationale for using lipid-binding ligands for EV isolation is that the lipid membrane is the defining and physically delimiting feature of EVs (6). By targeting membrane lipids, this isolation approach not only enriches for lipid membrane-bound entities, but also eliminates contaminating macromolecules.",

In our extraction protocol, CTB effectively extracts at least 96% of CD81 in the conditioned medium (5). Here, we determine the proteome of these CTB-EVs and CTB-EV depleted MSC EV preparation by mass spectrometry as previously described (10). 1,806 proteins were detected in the CTB-bound fraction and 1,547 were present in the CTB-depleted fraction (Supplementary File 1). 987 proteins were found in both fractions, suggesting that these 987 proteins are likely proteins commonly found in most EVs. The observation that 819 and 560 proteins were detected only in either CTB-bound or -depleted fraction respectively indicated that CTB-EVs represent a distinct class of EVs and that there were possibly other EV types beside the CTB-bound EVs (Fig. 1a). The proteins in the CTB-bound fraction and CTB-depleted fraction were functionally clustered into biological process, molecular functions and pathways by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis platform (Ingenuity Systems, Mountain View, CA). From the analysis of the CTB-bound fraction and CTB-depleted fraction, we respectively selected a set of 20 pathways that had the least likelihood of the clustered proteins being associated with a pathway due to random chance, that is, the lowest p value. There were many shared pathways in these 2 sets. There were also pathways that were unique to either the CTB-bound or depleted fractions (Fig. 1b).",

As these pathways essentially function to facilitate endocytosis, endosome-associated activities or exocytosis, their presence were consistent with our previous report that CTB-binding EVs from MSCs have an endosomal origin and were thus exosomes (5). Since endocytosis also plays a critical role in cell adhesion regulation by degrading and recycling cell adhesion molecules such as integrins (11) or ephrins (12), the dominance of celladhesion regulatory pathways such as Remodeling of Epithelial Adherens Junctions, Epithelial Adherens Junction Signaling, Germ Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling, Sertoli Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling, Ephrin Receptor Signaling and Integrin Signaling could be a coincidental presence in the proteome of endosomederived CTB-EVs (13\u00c115). However, we postulate that the dominating presence of both endocytosis-and celladhesion-associated pathways is not coincidental but rather integral to the biogenesis of exosome. Consistent with this hypothesis, many pathways regulating cytoskeletal biomechanics, which is critical to the membrane restructuring and intracellular membrane vesicle trafficking during endocytosis and cell adhesion, are also dominant in the proteome of CTB-EVs their significant clustering in Actin Cytoskeleton Signaling, and Actin Nucleation by ARP-WASP Complex pathways. Axonal Guidance Signaling, which involves cytoskeleton rearrangement and the modulation of cell-adhesion molecules (17), is also implicated by the CTB-EV proteome. Also, consistent with the central role of endocytosis in the biogenesis of exosomes, several of the cell signal transduction pathways featured in the functional clustering of the CTB-EV proteome shared a common regulatory function in endocytosis, namely 14-3-3-mediated Signaling, PI3K/AKT Signaling, Paxillin Signaling (18,19).",

After adaptor trimming and the elimination of reads with B18 nts, 117.76 million and 151.13 million reads remained for the ST-EV and unfractionated MSC EVs, respectively. Most of the reads were less than 100 nts, with most reads being less than 40 nt. These reads were then filtered to remove ribosomal RNA-like sequences before mapping to hg19 human genome; 19.9 million of the 35.71 million reads in ST-EV and 17.8 million of the 46.05 million reads in unfractionated MSC EVs were miscellaneous RNAs, that is, non-coding RNAs that cannot be categorized by ENSEMBL. The vast majority of miscellaneous RNA identified are a small non-coding RNA component of soluble ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) (Supplementary File 3). The top 5 expressed misc_RNA in both unfractionated MSC EVs and ST-EVs were Y RNAs. According to NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6084), Y RNAs are small non-coding RNAs that are the RNA component of soluble RNPs known as Ro RNPs. Ro RNPs have been associated with rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren syndrome. Qualitatively, the RNAs in ST-EV were different from those in unfractionated MSC EVs. The majority of RNAs in both ST-EV and the unfractionated MSC EVs is ribosomal RNAs. For the rest, the 5 most abundant classes of RNA in the ST-EVs were Y RNA, snRNA, miRNA, lincRNA and protein-coding RNA (Fig. 4a), while the 5 most abundant classes of RNA in the unfractionated MSC EVs were Y RNA, snoRNA, protein-coding RNA, snRNA and processed transcript (Fig. 4b). The top 5 most abundant miRNAs in both preparation are mir-191, mir-181, mir-22, mir-92 and mir-221 ( Supplementary Fig. 1, The TPM (tags per million) of miRNAs can be found in Supplementary File 2). Therefore, it is possible that ST-EVs are not the only RNA-containing EVs in the MSC EV preparation.",

However, during apoptosis, the level of CD9 relative to actin was elevated by 3.8 fold ( Fig. 5), suggesting that the composition of AV-EVs produced by healthy MSCs was different from that by apoptotic MSCs, and more exosome-associated markers were being secreted in AV-EVs during apoptosis.

However, this elucidation of the proteome of CTB-EVs by mass spectrometry also revealed that this proteome constituted only part of the MSC EV proteome, suggesting the presence of other EV types.

Although AV-EVs also contained very low levels of exosome-associated proteins, prior extraction with either CTB or AV did not reduce the level of exosome-associated CD81 in AV-or CTB-EVs, respectively. Therefore, AV-EVs cannot be extracted by CTB and vice versa, and AV and CTB extraction are mutually exclusive. In treating permeabilized MSCs with fluorescence-labelled CTB, the CTB-binding activity in MSCs was either confined to specific domains in the plasma membrane or in punctate cytoplasmic distribution in co-localization with CD81 (26), consistent with the biogenesis of endosomes. This cellular distribution of CTBbinding activity could be attributed to the cellular receptor for CTB, namely GM1 ganglioside. GM1 gangliosides are known to be enriched in lipid rafts, which are sites of active endocytosis, and are thus enriched in endosomes as well.",

            "text": "In contrast to CTB-binding activity, AV-binding activity was concentrated mainly in the cytoplasm and did not co-localize with CD81, suggesting that AV-EVs were derived from membrane organelles in the cytoplasm. In the presence of Ca 2 ' , AV is known to have a high specific affinity for phosphatidylserine but in the absence of Ca 2 ' , AV binds phosphatidylcholine (27). Therefore, the staining of the cytoplasm and not the phosphatidylcholine-rich plasma membrane by AV is not an artefact caused by a lack of Ca 2 ' . Although phosphatidylserine is better known as an extracellular cell surface marker for apoptosis, its main subcellular locations and functions are intracellular (review (28)). The organelles known to be most enriched in phosphatidylserine are the plasma membrane, endosomes and secretory vesicles. This subcellular distribution of PS is thus different from our observed subcellular locations of AV-binding activities. We postulate that one possible reason for this discrepancy is the context-dependent AV binding of PS, that is, the presence of other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine, could affect the binding of PS by AV (29). Hence, a low abundance PS in the right context may bind AV more efficiently than a high abundance PS in a poor context. Another possible reason is that unlike antibodies, all 3 ligands, that is, CTB, AV and ST, bind multiple copies of their lipid ligands. One AV molecule binds 4\u00c18 PS molecule (30,31), while both CTB and ST are pentamers in which one CTB monomer binds one GM1 (32), and one ST monomer binds one or more GB3 (33). As such, the cellular locations of CTB, AV and ST binding activity highlight only those locations in which their lipid ligands are highly enriched in sufficiently close physical proximity for polyvalent binding. As such, the efficacy or efficiency of CTB, AVor ST in extracting EVs is highly dependent on the spacing and density of their lipid ligands. It cannot be predicted simply by the presence or absence of the lipids in the EV membrane. Based on the cytoplasmic distribution of AV-binding sites, the biogenesis pathway of AV-EVs is likely to either physically or biochemically intersect with that of CTB-EVs, which would provide a rationale for some of the proteomic intersect of AV-and CTB-EVs, as evidenced by the low level of CD9, CD81, Alix Tsg101 and CD59 relative to actin Of the 3 EVs, ST-EVs were uniquely different not only in their cargo of RNA and EDA-fibronectin but also in the cellular distribution of their binding activity, which was restricted to the nucleus. We had previously reported that RNAs secreted by MSC were less than 300 nts and were encapsulated in cholesterol-rich phospholipid vesicles (4). These RNAs were susceptible to RNAse activity only after pre-treatment with detergent, phospholipase A2 or cyclodextrin a chelator of cholesterol. They also have a low EVlike buoyant density of 1.1 g/mL and this buoyant density could be increased towards a more RNA-like buoyant density by treatment with a combination of phospholipase A2 and cyclodextrin (1.13\u00c11.16 g/mL) or an SDS-based lysis buffer (1.15\u00c11.18 g/mL). This increase in apparent RNA density by lipid extraction treatments demonstrates that the RNA is in a lipid complex such that the removal of less dense lipids increase their apparent density. Until now, there are no evidence to suggest that RNA-containing EVs from MSCs were physically different from other EVs. ST-EVs carry at least 50% of the total MSC EV RNA, while both CTB-and AV-EVs each carry less than 0.5%. Therefore, any EV RNA-mediated biological activity is likely to reside with ST-EVs, and not CTB-and AV-EVs. Although this nuclear location of the binding site could provide a rationale for its RNA cargo, the biogenesis and the biological significance of ST-EVs, its cargo of relatively short and seemingly non-functional RNAs, and its cargo of fibronectin, an extracellular protein, are enigmatic from our present perspective of EV biogenesis and functions. To date, biogenesis of EVs from the nucleus has not been described and no currently known biological process or processes could provide a mechanistic model for the biogenesis of EVs that involves both nuclear materials and extracellular matrix proteins.",
