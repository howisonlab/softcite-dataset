Sixty male BALB/c mice, aged six to eight weeks-old, were divided into groups of 10 each; fifty were orally infected with 300 larvaed eggs of T. canis and grouped as follows, G I: infected untreated mice; G II: infected mice treated with MBZ (15 mg/kg/day) 10 days postinfection (dpi); G III: infected mice treated with NTZ (20 mg/kg/day) 10 dpi; G IV: infected mice treated with MBZ 60 dpi; G V: infected mice treated with NTZ 60 dpi; GVI: control group comprising uninfected mice. Mice were bled via retro-orbital plexus on four occasions between 30 and 120 dpi. Sera were processed using the ELISA technique to detect IgG anti-Toxocara antibodies. At 120 dpi, mice were sacrificed for larval recovery in the CNS, liver, lungs, kidneys, eyes and carcass. Results showed similar levels of anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies among mice infected but not submitted to treatment and groups treated with MBZ or NTZ, 10 and 60 dpi. Larval recovery showed similar values in groups treated with NTZ and MBZ 10 dpi. MBZ showed better efficacy 60 dpi, with a 72.6% reduction in the parasite load compared with NTZ, which showed only 46.5% reduction. We conclude that administration of these anthelmintics did not modify the humoral response in experimental infection by T. canis. No parasitological cure was observed with either drug; however, a greater reduction in parasite load was achieved following treatment with MBZ."

Previous studies indicated that mice and other murine behave like paratenic hosts when infected by larvae of T. canis 30 and are therefore suitable models for studying host-parasite relationships in the case of human infection with this nematode 4,11 . In C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice infected with T. canis and untreated, the larvae can be found in the brain and carcass, even up to a year after inoculation, with a slight reduction in the total larval count 17,20 . Various anthelmintics have been used in the treatment of murine toxocariasis, in order to evaluate their efficacy: mebendazole, albendazole, fenbendazole and thiabendazole. The first three, and diethylcarbamazine, were recommended by the WHO in 1995 as effective drugs against toxocariasis 20 . According to SMITH et al. 29 , mebendazole seems to be a good alternative for toxocariasis treatment in paratenic hosts. LESCANO et al. 21 also reported a significant decrease in the parasite load of mice experimentally infected by T. canis and treated with mebendazole, thiabendazole or ivermectin.",

However, at the end of the experiment, larval recovery was shown to be the most appropriate tool for evaluating drug efficacy in this experimental model.   Considering the larval recovery results, the relative ineffectiveness of mebendazole or nitazoxanide administration in the treatment of Toxocara infections in the murine model is evident and this is probably true in the case of human infections by T. canis, which would result in visceral larva migrans syndrome. Despite these fairly moderate results, the greater reduction observed in the parasite load following mebendazole administration, compared with the results achieved when nitazoxanide was used, deserves some attention."

Sessenta camundongos BALB/c machos, com idade entre seis e oito semanas foram divididos em grupos de 10 cada, 50 foram infectados oralmente com 300 ovos larvados de T. canis e agrupados a seguir: GI: camundongos infectados n\u00e3o tratados; GII: camundongos infectados tratados com MBZ (15 mg/kg/dia) 10 dias p\u00f3s-infec\u00e7\u00e3o (dpi); GIII: camundongos infectados tratados com NTZ (20 mg/kg/dia) 10 dpi, GIV: camundongos infectados tratados com MBZ 60 dpi; GV: camundongos infectados tratados com NTZ 60 dpi; GVI: controle n\u00e3o infectado. Os camundongos foram sangrados via plexo retro orbit\u00e1rio em quatro ocasi\u00f5es entre o 30\u00ba e 120\u00ba dpi. Os soros foram processados pela t\u00e9cnica de ELISA para detec\u00e7\u00e3o de anticorpos IgG anti-Toxocara. Aos 120 dpi, os animais foram sacrificados para a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o larv\u00e1ria do SNC, f\u00edgado, pulm\u00f5es, rins, olhos e carca\u00e7a.

Os valores da recupera\u00e7\u00e3o larval foram similares nos grupos tratados com NTZ e MBZ 10 dpi. MBZ mostrou melhor efic\u00e1cia aos 60 dpi, com redu\u00e7\u00e3o de 72,6% da carga parasit\u00e1ria comparada com NTZ, que mostrou redu\u00e7\u00e3o somente de 46,5%.

N\u00e3o foi observada cura parasitol\u00f3gica com nenhuma das drogas; por\u00e9m maior redu\u00e7\u00e3o na carga parasit\u00e1ria foi obtida ap\u00f3s o tratamento com MBZ."
