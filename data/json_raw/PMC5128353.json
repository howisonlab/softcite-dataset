No patient met the DSM-IV criteria for the specifier 'Severe with Psychotic Features' , and none had received psychotropic medication with the current episode. In addition, no patients had received psychotropic medication within 4 weeks. Twentytwo healthy volunteers without histories of psychiatric illness were recruited by advertisement. A psychiatrist screened the control group with an interview and then biochemical tests were administered. Volunteers with a family history of mood disorders or evidence of inflammatory illness (flu, allergic disease, or dermatitis) or immunopathies were not included. The protocol was approved by the ethics review board of Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.",

We evaluated the analytical performance of the commercially available assay kits, Human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel 1 and Human Neurodegenerative Disease Panel 1 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Seven cytokines (eotaxin, sCD40L, IL-8, MCP-1, TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, and MIP-1alpha) were finally selected in the consideration of precision, calibration range and the limit of quantification of the assay method. These inflammatory markers have been shown to be relevant in psychiatric diseases. 7,14,15,28,29 Venous blood was drawn at baseline and at week 6. After serum isolation by centrifugation, the samples were stored at -80\u00b0C.

            "text": "CD40 ligand (CD40L) is a transmembrane glycoprotein struc- The protein binds to the CD40 receptor and induces the production of cytokines, connective tissue degrading enzymes, and upregulates the inflammatory response. 32 This interaction between CD40 and CD40L is known to be an important step in the priming of helper T-cells. 33 Leo et al. 28 reported that sCD40L levels increased in patients with MDD compared with controls and also found a correlation between the level of sCD40L and the severity of depression as assessed by the HAM-D (Table 4). In addition, they reported that mood improvement with SSRI treatment was associated with a reduction in sCD40L. 28 Another study reported by Neubauer et al. 34 showed a concordant result, that CD40L was elevated in patients with depression as compared to controls. However, our results showed a diametrical association; the level of sCD40L in healthy controls was higher than that of depressive patients. We can speculate several reasons for the discrepancy. The first is the difference of the illness duration. Previous studies were conducted during the first episode of depression; however, in our study, depressive patients (72.7%) were experiencing their second or a later episode of MDD. It has been suggested that cytokine-induced neurochemical alterations might vary with the number of depressive episodes. 35 Griffiths et al. 36 suggested that the recurrence of depression might involve chronic cytokine activation. Further studies for CD40L in recurrent depression are needed. Another possible factor for such discrepancy is the proportion of old age patients. Previous studies that reported an elevated level of CD40L in depressive patients included mostly middle-aged patients. 28,34 Our patients were mostly elderly (age >60 years, 74.2%), and a large portion of them had late-onset illness (age of first onset >60 years, 45.5%). Several studies have suggested that the age at onset can vary in different subtypes of depression, especially in terms of heritability. 37,38 In addition, previous studies reported that proinflammatory cytokines increase in healthy elderly people, [39][40][41] although, we could not find a significant relationship between age, age on onset and sCD40L in our study subjects. Another consideration is that our study was conducted in Asian population. Further studies with clinically homogeneous samples in recurrent depression and in an elderly group or various ethnic groups will be required.",

            "text": "Relatively few studies have investigated the association between MCP-1 and depression. Lehto et al. 45 and Grassi-Oliveria et al. 47 found that depression was associated with lower MCP-1 concentrations compare to healthy controls, but others reported contrary results (Table 4). 42,48 Our results, finding lower levels of IL-8 and MCP-1, suggest a reduced level of chemokines in depression. The detailed mechanism for this association is unclear. The neuroprotective function of neuronal chemokines, 49,50 and their dopaminergic activity-enhancing effect in the central nervous system could be possible explanations. However, limitations to our interpretation should be noted because our results were obtained from peripheral blood.",

            "text": "Sutcigil et al. 48 reported that the level of MCP-1 decreased after sertraline treatment. However, we found an increase in MCP-1 levels following antidepressant treatment. The major difference between our result and the previous study is the number of episodes that patients experienced. Sutcigil et al. included only first episode patients in their study, but, as noted above, most of our study patients were recurrent depression. Although, we could not find a significant relationship between episode number and the level of MCP-1 in our study subjects, the difference in the antidepressants used may have also contributed to this discordance. Interestingly, the directions of change in both studies were toward those of the healthy controls. The study of Sutcigil et al. showed a higher level of MCP-1 in depressive patients compare to healthy controls, and the difference decreased after treatment. We found a decreased level of MCP-1 in depressive patients, and it was normalized toward the level of healthy controls after antidepressant treatment. The antidepressant effect of COX-2 inhibitors that block production of prostaglandin E and proinflammatory cytokines were investigated in several clinical trials. [51][52][53] In one study, combination therapy of COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) and sertraline reduced level of serum IL-6 levels in patients with MDD, and reduction of the severity of depressive symptoms and reduction of the level of serum IL-6 were significantly correlated. 53 Further studies that investigate the effect of the combination treatment with COX-2 inhibitor on the level of MCP-1 could be helpful. We found no association between the level of eotaxin or TNF-alpha and depression. These negative results were inconsistent with recent studies for eotaxin 47,54 and a meta-analysis of TNF-alpha. 7 However, our findings are in line with other reports conducted in elderly patients. [55][56][57] Additional studies adjusted for age with larger sample sizes are required. Several limitations were present in our study. Our sample was relatively small. The cross-sectional design for association between depression and cytokines precludes conclusions about causality. We could not consider potential variables, such as smoking, lifetime use of anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs, minor medical illness, and body mass index. Another consideration is that because our patients were mostly elderly due to the clinical setting of patient enrollment, the generalizability of our results to other age groups may be limited.",
