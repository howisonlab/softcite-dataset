            "text": "Epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (EITL, also known as type II enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma) is an aggressive intestinal disease with poor prognosis and its molecular alterations have not been comprehensively characterized. We aimed to identify actionable easy-to-screen alterations that would allow better diagnostics and/or treatment of this deadly disease. By performing whole-exome sequencing of four EITL tumor-normal pairs, followed by amplicon deep sequencing of 42 tumor samples, frequent alterations of the JAK-STAT and G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways were discovered in a large portion of samples. Specifically, STAT5B was mutated in a remarkable 63% of cases, JAK3 in 35% and GNAI2 in 24%, with the majority occurring at known activating hotspots in key functional domains. Moreover, STAT5B locus carried copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity resulting in the duplication of the mutant copy, suggesting the importance of mutant STAT5B dosage for the development of EITL. Dysregulation of the JAK-STAT and GPCR pathways was also supported by gene expression profiling and further verified in patient tumor samples. In vitro overexpression of GNAI2 mutants led to the upregulation of pERK1/2, a member of MEK-ERK pathway. Notably, inhibitors of both JAK-STAT and MEK-ERK pathways effectively reduced viability of patient-derived primary EITL cells, indicating potential therapeutic strategies for this neoplasm with no effective treatment currently available.",

[1][2][3] EATL was included into the World Health Organization classification of hematolymphoid neoplasms for the first time in 2008 and consists of type I and type II. 1 Classical or type I EATL is known to associate with celiac disease, HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes, and is the more common form in the West. 1,2,[4][5][6][7][8] On the contrary, type II EATL is more prevalent in Asia and multiple studies have failed to confirm an association with celiac disease. [9][10][11][12] Given the distinct clinicopathological features of type II EATL as described below and the lack of association with celiac disease, the term 'enteropathy-associated' in its nomenclature is not appropriate and various names including monomorphic intestinal T-cell lymphoma 11 and epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (EITL) 13 have been proposed. In this study, we will refer to this neoplasm as EITL henceforth.",

Together with others, we have comprehensively described the histology of this complex disease. 11,13 In short, EITL displays zonal variation featuring central invasive sheets of monomorphic neoplastic lymphocytes, a peripheral zone of mucosa infiltrated by morphologically atypical intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and a distant zone featuring mucosa with normal villous architecture but increased number of morphologically normal IELs. The putative cell of origin is an intestinal IEL and clonality analyses have shown that the IELs in the distant mucosal zone share clonal relationship with the invasive lymphoma. 13,14 The CD8+ CD56+ phenotype and extensive nuclear expression of megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase are features that are distinct from classical EATL, 13,15 with the majority of neoplastic cells expressing CD8\u03b1\u03b1 homodimers. 13 Opinion is still divided whether these cells display mainly T-cell receptor (TCR) \u03b1\u03b2 or \u03b3\u03b4 phenotypes. 11,13 Cytogenetic studies have demonstrated gains and translocations of MYC (8q24) 10,13,16 in EITL, although they may also be seen in classical EATL. 17 Conversely, gains of 1q32.2-q41 and 5q34-q35.2 are more common in EATL compared with EITL, whereas 9q31.3 gain and 16q21.1 loss can be observed in both classical EATL and EITL. 1,3 Recently, it was reported that an activating STAT5B p.N642H mutation is common in T-cell lymphoma derived from \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells, including some cases of EITL. 18 We used nextgeneration sequencing techniques in a multicenter study to describe the frequent genetic changes in EITL. We provide here the first whole-exome sequencing (WES) study of this disease and, in the largest series published to date, demonstrate that STAT5Bactivating mutations are found in EITL tumors of both TCR\u03b1\u03b2 and TCR\u03b3\u03b4 origin. We present multiple lines of evidence that JAK-STAT and G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways are highly activated in EITL, and, most importantly, inhibition of these pathways by targeted therapy effectively reduces the viability of primary EITL cells.",

Sanger validation of 296 candidate variants showed a false-positive rate of 3.72%. EITL samples presented a high mutation burden with an average of 85 mutations per sample (range 59-137). A total of 340 nonsynonymous somatic mutations were identified in 313 genes. Seven of those genes also harbored silent somatic mutations (Supplementary Table 5). The nonsynonymous variants comprised 284 missense and 16 nonsense mutations, 13 frameshift indels, 25 splice site mutations and 2 mutations resulting in loss of stop codon ( Supplementary Figure 1a). As observed in most other cancers, 27,28 EITL mutation spectrum was characterized by the predominance of C4T transitions ( Supplementary Figure 1b).",

Three samples possessed the common p.N642H mutation, whereas the fourth harbored a complex substitution event in the beginning of exon 17, resulting in two amino-acid changes-p.V712E and p.S715L (see Supplementary Note and Supplementary Figure 2). Both JAK3 and GNAI2 were mutated in a remarkable 2/4 cases.

            "text": "Prevalence screening of GNAI2, JAK3, STAT5B and CREBBP The high frequency of STAT5B, JAK3 and GNAI2 mutations in a small discovery cohort of only four samples was intriguing, prompting us to further analyze the prevalence of these mutations in a larger series of EITL samples. Forty-two additional EITL tumors (1 snap frozen and 41 archival samples) were screened for GNAI2, JAK3 and STAT5B mutations using amplicon deep sequencing. A total of 57 identified mutations were covered by an average of 20 004 reads (range 104-175 515; Supplementary Table 8). As the amplicons covered only common mutation hotspots reported in COSMIC v.72 and positions identified in the discovery cohort, it is likely that our results are lower-bound estimates of the true mutation frequency of these three genes. Figure 2 summarizes the results from both the discovery and prevalence cohorts. STAT5B mutations were detected in 25/42 (60%) cases, with 24/42 (57%) carrying known activating mutations (p.N642H) in the Src homology 2 dimerization domain (Figure 2b). JAK3 was mutated in 14/42 (33%) samples with 13/42 (31%) harboring activating mutations (p.M511I, p.A573V and p.V674A/F), the majority located in the pseudokinase domain (Figure 2c). We identified two samples carrying two separate JAK3activating mutations and a remarkable three activating mutations were identified in a third case indicating profound alteration of JAK3 function in these patients. Notably, none of these samples contained an activating STAT5B mutation (Figure 2a). Collectively, the JAK-STAT pathway was altered in 32/42 (76%) cases. It is remarkable that a large subset of tumors harbor co-occurring activating mutations in two members of the same pathway. A similar phenomenon was recently described for JAK1 and STAT3 in systemic ALK-negative anaplastic large T-cell lymphomas. 30 Moreover, these mutants were demonstrated to act in synergy to constitutively activate downstream STAT3 signaling. Further studies for mutated JAK3 and STAT5B are thus warranted and might shed light on EITL tumorigenesis.",

This phenomenon has previously been observed in JAK2 and JAK3 in other hematological neoplasms, 40,41 and is thought to arise from somatic recombination events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time acquired uniparental disomy has been described for STAT5B and further indicates the pivotal role played by this gene in the development of EITL. Consistent with this, immunohistochemical analysis of samples with mutated STAT5B revealed noticeable upregulation of phosphorylated STAT5 (Supplementary Table 12), an example of which is shown in Figure 3c. It would be interesting to see whether there exists a transition from heterozygosity to homozygosity either histologically from distant mucosa to central tumor zone or clinically from primary diagnosis to relapse representing clonal evolution as observed in other tumors. 41,42 We also identified two samples with amplification of the PIK3CG gene (five and four copies, respectively) that was also evident on protein level both for PIK3CG itself and downstream pAKT in one sample (Supplementary Figure 7). The prevalence of such amplification should be studied in a larger cohort as it might open up novel possibilities for targeted therapy. The first PI3K inhibitor is already in use for treatment of certain B-cell malignancies with many more currently in development. 43 Pathways and biological functions affected in EITL To identify key biological functions and signaling pathways affected in EITL, two different approaches were used-Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of mutated genes from WES and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) following gene expression profiling of EITL tumors.",

GSEA against Molecular Signatures Database gene sets 45 was used to identify deregulated pathways. The used gene sets and all statistics from GSEA are shown in Supplementary Table 17. It is noteworthy that GSEA independently confirmed the findings of IPA analysis using mutated genes from WES. Several aspects of GPCR signaling were found significantly enriched in EITL samples including GPCR ligand binding, signaling by GPCR and, importantly, G\u03b1 i signaling ( Supplementary Figure 8). These clearly suggest a marked deregulation of G\u03b1 i signaling in EITL and further indicate the functional importance of discovered GNAI2 mutations.",

More importantly, an outstanding association was identified with genes containing STAT5B binding sites in their promoters, both for the shorter and longer consensus motif. We further confirmed this by GSEA against publicly available gene set of STAT5 target genes. 46 There was a significant enrichment between STAT5 targets and genes upregulated in EITL (normalized enrichment score = 1.78, false discovery rate q-value o 0.001; Supplementary  Figure 8d). Gene expression profiling data was validated by real-time PCR of randomly selected genes (Supplementary Table 18). The values from the two experiments were consistent, although the correlation was not statistically significant because of the small sample size (Supplementary Figure 9).

A strong upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 level was detected in both mutant cells, whereas the total ERK1/2 protein levels remained unchanged (Figure 4a). The same observation was made in two independent cell lines. Consistent with this, immunohistochemical analysis of GNAI2 mutant cases also revealed upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Supplementary Table 12), examples of which are shown in Figure 4b, suggesting that the MEK-ERK signaling pathway is aberrantly activated in these EITL tumors.",

JAK3 and STAT5B are both directly targetable by small-molecule inhibitors, and because mutant GNAI2 activates the MEK-ERK pathway, MEK inhibitors may be effective for the treatment of EITL. To further confirm the involvement of JAK-STAT and GPCR signaling pathways in the survival of EITL, we evaluated the effect of two inhibitors of both pathways in primary EITL cells-Tofacitinib (pan-JAK inhibitor), Stattic (STAT3 inhibitor) and MEK inhibitors Trametinib and PD0325901. All four inhibitors reduced cell viability in a dosedependent manner compared with the vehicle-treated control (Figure 4c). Importantly, the primary cells were resistant to an inhibitor of a non-relevant pathway, the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib, suggesting that the observed effect was not because of general cytotoxicity. Moreover, all four drugs clearly inhibited the downstream signaling cascades as demonstrated by suppression of STAT3, STAT5 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 4d).",

Further supporting our data, JAK-STAT cascade inactivation either by knockdown of pathway members or targeted therapy also effectively reduces cell viability of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells that harbor an activating p. A573V JAK3 mutation. [49][50][51][52] Despite the lack of GNAI2 mutation in the primary EITL cells, several other members of the GPCR pathway-the GPCRs HTR1F, GRM5, MRGPRX3 and GPR179, and protein tyrosine phosphatase DUSP4 (Supplementary Table 5)are all altered in these cells potentially leading to downstream activation of the GPCR pathway. Importantly, DUSP4 is known to inactivate ERK1/2. 53 The p.R300W mutation identified in the primary EITL cells is positioned right in the middle of DUSP4 catalytic dual-specificity phosphatase domain. As commonly observed for mutations within the functional domains of enzymes, it is likely that the identified p.R300W mutation causes inactivation of the DUSP4 protein that leads to the activation of ERK proteins and might explain the effectiveness of MEK inhibition in these cells. In addition, GPCR, G\u03b1 i and MEK-ERK pathways are all significantly enriched in the original tumor sample ( Supplementary Figures 8a and c), further supporting the aberrant activation of these signaling pathways. Taken together, these results indicate that targeted therapy may be useful in the treatment of EITL patients.",

(a) Stable cell lines were created by overexpressing GNAI2 wild-type and mutants in HuT78 and Jurkat cells. The expression of relevant proteins was assessed by western blot. (b) Representative images of pERK1/2 immunohistochemical staining in GNAI2 wild-type and mutant tumors. Magnification \u00d7 400. (c) Representative ex vivo cell viability assay in primary EITL cells treated with PD0325901 and Stattic for 72 h, and Tofacitinib, Trametinib and Gefitinib for 96 h. All results are normalized to the control (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and presented as mean \u00b1 s.d. The experiment was repeated at least two times with each inhibitor. (d) Immunoblots of indicated proteins in primary EITL cells treated with PD0325901, Tofacitinib and Trametinib for two and Stattic for 24 h at indicated concentrations.",
