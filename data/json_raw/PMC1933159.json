It also employs a dynamic programming algorithm to minimize the free energy of the resulting joint structure of the two interacting RNAs. Lastly, pRuNA is an efficient database pruning service; which given a query RNA, eliminates a significant portion of an ncRNA database and returns only a few ncRNAs as potential regulators. taveRNA is available at http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/taverna.",

The discovery that RNA molecules can regulate gene expression completely altered this simplistic picture (1). This important discovery, in particular the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi), the post-transcriptional silencing of gene expression via interactions between mRNAs and their antisense RNAs (by A. Fire and C. Mello) was awarded with the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.",

Despite a 30-year-effort towards its solution, the best algorithms and software for RNA structure prediction are still far from perfect. The most common approach to the RNA secondary structure prediction problem is the standard thermodynamic approach. This general methodology suggests to compute the secondary structure of an RNA molecule by minimizing the total free energy of its substructures such as stems, loops and bulges. alteRNA is an alternative thermodynamic approach to the RNA secondary structure prediction problem, which aims to minimize a linear combination of total free energy and total energy density using the dynamic programming formulation proposed in (3), in contrast to the available alternatives such as Mfold (4), RNAscf (5) and alifold (6), which all employ the standard thermodynamic approach.",

However, until recently no such algorithm existed for reliably predicting the joint secondary structure of two interacting RNA molecules, or measuring the stability of such a joint structure. At SFU Lab for Computational Biology, we developed inteRNA the first program that aims to compute the joint structure prediction of two given RNA sequences through minimizing their total free energy, which is a function of the topology of the joint structure. The algorithmic foundations of inteRNA were introduced in (7). inteRNA aims to minimize the joint free energy under a number of energy models with growing complexity. Our default energy model is based mostly on stacked pair energies given by Mathews et al. (8)-the free energy model employed by Mfold. Because there is very little thermodynamic information on kissing loop sequences in the literature, inteRNA employs the approach used by Rivas and Eddy (9) to differentiate the thermodynamic parameters of 'external' bonds from the 'internal' bonds, i.e. we simply multiply the external parameters with a weight slightly smaller than 1. Note that the default algorithmic engine used by inteRNA requires substantial resources in terms of running time and memory which could be prohibitive for predicting joint structure of sufficiently long RNAs. Thus we made available an alternative heuristic engine that aims to capture the joint secondary structure of interacting RNAs. This heuristic approach is based on the observation that the substructures that are available independently in each RNA are mostly preserved in their joint secondary structure.",

As many novel regulatory RNA classes are being discovered, the determination of the exact functionality of all regulatory ncRNAs is one of the most significant scientific challenges to be tackled in the coming years. Our software tool pRuNA is developed for helping to address this challenge: it aims to identify all potential regulatory ncRNAs that can establish stable joint structures with a query mRNA (10). An important component of pRuNA is a sequence filter which eliminates a significant fraction of the available ncRNA collection and retains only the most likely ncRNA candidates for forming a stable joint structure with the query mRNA. We note that the majority of regulatory ncRNAs are only partially complementary to their target mRNA sequences. Typically these RNAs contain at least two short (5-7 nt) motifs on their loop structures that are complementary to the specific single-stranded locations in the target RNAs (11). Thus pRuNA first identifies all pairs of 5-mer motifs from the ncRNA loop sequences that are complementary to a pair of 5-mer motifs in the loop sequences of the query mRNA. The ncRNAs that include such 5-mer motif pairs are then tested against the query mRNA via the use of inteRNA and those which can establish stable joint structures are returned by the program.",

This alternative thermodynamic approach which we call Densityfold (3) aims to minimize the linear combination of the total free energy and total energy density of all substructures in the RNA molecule. Given an RNA secondary structure, the energy density of a basepair is defined as the free energy of the substructure that starts with the basepair, normalized by the length of the underlying sequence. The energy density of an unpaired base is then defined to be the energy density of the closest basepair that encloses it. Densityfold thus aims to minimize ED(n) \u00fe s\u00c1E(n), where ED(n) is the total energy density of paired and unpaired bases, E(n) is the total free energy and n is the length of the RNA sequence. Here s determines the weight of the contribution of the total free energy in the optimization function. As s approaches to 1, the predicted secondary structure gets closer to that implied by the standard thermodynamic approach (employed by Mfold). We have observed that s \u00bc 5 generally gives the most accurate prediction, in terms of structure edit distance (13), however in some RNA sequences, different s values can outperform s \u00bc 5.",

Interactions thus typically occur between kissing hairpin loops. The loop model first predicts the secondary structure of each RNA sequence independently using three different approaches: (i) through the standard thermodynamic model (Mfold Loop Model), (ii) through Stacked Pair Model using a single RNA sequence (Default Loop Model) and (iii) through alteRNA (alteRNA Loop Model). It then identifies all independent subsequences of each RNA structure: these are substructures (each implied by a basepair) whose sequence length is less than a specified value. It then computes the joint secondary structure that can be established between each pair of independent subsequences (one subsequence from each RNA) and the free energy of this joint structure. Finally, it finds the set of independent subsequence pairs which can co-exist and minimize the total free energy of the overall secondary structure.",

Each entry in the lookup table maintains a pointer to every occurrence of the respective 5-mer motif pair in the loop sequences of the ncRNA structures in the Rfam database. For querying the index, pRuNA first identifies the loop sequences from the mRNA, based on the given secondary structure information. It then extracts each pair of non-overlapping 5-mer motifs from the mRNA loop sequences and checks the lookup table for its reverse complement. The union of the set of ncRNAs that include each motif pair are retained by pRuNA, whereas the remainder of the ncRNAs in the database are eliminated. We have observed that many of the motif pairs in the lookup table occur very frequently in ncRNA sequences and thus have limited information content. We omitted the 5-mer pairs which occur in more than the number (14) of ncRNAs that include a 'typical' motif pair. This increased our pruning efficiency substantially yet had no effect on the quality of the results: we have tested pRuNA mRNAs that are known to be regulated by an ncRNA available through the NPInter database (15). For all 24 of these mRNAs, pRuNA was able to return the known regulatory ncRNA among the set of potential regulators, while achieving a pruning efficiency of 86% on the average. If the search is restricted to E. coli ncRNAs, the pruning efficiency for the 22 mRNAs regulated by these ncRNAs go up to 91% on the average. Further details on pRuNA (including the method and experimental results) can be found in (10).",

On an RNA sequence with length n, the running time of alteRNA is O(n 4 ) and the memory requirement is O(n 4 ). On two input RNA sequences S and R, where |S| \u00bc n and |R| \u00bc m, the running time of inteRNA is O(n 3 m 3 ) and the memory requirement is O(n 2 m 2 ). It is possible to improve the running time using the loop model to where k is the maximum independent structure size. The running time of pRuNA is linear with the input sequence length and the result set.
