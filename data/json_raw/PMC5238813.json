            "text": "The effects of different formulations and manufacturing process conditions on the physical properties of a solid dosage form are of importance to the pharmaceutical industry. It is vital to have in-depth understanding of the material properties and governing parameters of its processes in response to different formulations. Understanding the mentioned aspects will allow tighter control of the process, leading to implementation of quality-by-design (QbD) practices. Computational intelligence (CI) offers an opportunity to create empirical models that can be used to describe the system and predict future outcomes in silico. CI models can help explore the behavior of input parameters, unlocking deeper understanding of the system. This research endeavor presents CI models to predict the porosity of tablets created by roll-compacted binary mixtures, which were milled and compacted under systematically varying conditions. CI models were created using tree-based methods, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and symbolic regression trained on an experimental data set and screened using root-mean-square error (RMSE) scores. The experimental data were composed of proportion of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) (in percentage), granule size fraction (in micrometers), and die compaction force (in kilonewtons) as inputs and porosity as an output. The resulting models show impressive generalization ability, with ANNs (normalized root-mean-square error [NRMSE] =1%) and symbolic regression (NRMSE =4%) as the best-performing methods, also exhibiting reliable predictive behavior when presented with a challenging external validation data set (best achieved symbolic regression: NRMSE =3%). Symbolic regression demonstrates the transition from the black box modeling paradigm to more transparent predictive models. Predictive performance and feature selection behavior of CI models hints at the most important variables within this factor space."

Powder characteristics, manufacturing process parameters, and various other tangible entities have profound effects on the quality of a solid dosage form in a complex way. The quality of a solid dosage form, among other factors, can be assessed based on its hardness and porosity, which can be used as indirect measurements of its capability and rate to dissolve. 1 In most cases, the complexity of relationships among the possible material parameters and upstream processes diminishes the understanding of the system as a whole.",

            "text": "Porosity, known as the ratio of volume of void space to the bulk volume and generally represented as a percentage, is an important property that controls the microstructure of the tablet during compression. It can assist in the understanding of the dispersion mechanism, behavior after ingestion, moisture penetration, and with certain prerequisites, even bioavailability. Porosity measurements are also known to be relevant indicators of drug stability. 2 The effect of shape and porosity of granules has been studied by Johansson and Alderborn, 3 suggesting that stronger tablets are formed when granules with irregular porosity are compressed. Theoretically, the porosity of a tablet can be a predictor of its dissolution behavior as well. 4 Previous works on this topic have revealed that porosity influences tablet strength; lactose tablets with larger pores were weak [5][6][7] and similar relationships were observed with other excipients such as glucose and mannitol. 7,8 The importance of porosity as an indirect measurement of dissolution was demonstrated using rate of water uptake, and solvent penetration was studied in microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) tablets with different porosities. Results showed that tablets with 10% and 15% porosity take up water much faster (30 s) and expand by up to 50% of original thickness, while tablets with 5% porosity are much slower in water uptake behavior (148 s), in addition to showing less expansion. 9 The correlation of porosity with die compaction force has been well studied in the past. 10,11 It was explained that tablets made from pharmaceutical powders do not exhibit the quasi-exponential trend proposed by Heckel 12 for evolution of porosity against pressure. Pharmaceutical powders exhibit plastic deformation properties, while Heckel's model works well with metallic powders. 11 Tablet brittleness has been described as an exponential growth function of porosity using a diverse set of pharmaceutical tablets by Gong et al. 13 Data-driven empirical models established using computational intelligence (CI) methods can be used as surrogates to run in silico experiments to predict porosity. Use of CI offers reduction in experiments, leading to cost and time savings and broader understanding of the system. CI tools have been used in works addressing the pharmaceutical industry's various problems, including tensile strength, porosity, and dissolution problems. [14][15][16][17][18] Generally, modeling and simulation (M-and-S) is a huge area of science, in which various paradigms of modeling are used, mostly based on well-established theory. In pharmaceutical sciences, a broad area of molecular modeling, using ab initio techniques such as molecular docking offers profound examples of such an approach. [19][20][21] However, when no such theory is present, only empirical modeling is a suitable alternative, in particular with data-driven modeling in focus.",

Thus, rgp is an implementation of GP methods in the R environment. 29 Package rgp results are simple representations of the problem without being exposed to a priori information. rgp offers various options for initialization, variation, and selection procedures inherent in GP. GP implements a tree structure representation to show the mathematical equations. The tree structure is composed of two parts: function set (nodes) and a terminal set (leaves). 30 The function set can be chosen through the operators {+, -, *, /, sin, cos, log, abs}, mathematical functions, conditional statements, or even the user-defined operators. In addition, the terminal set includes constants and model variables. 31,32 To find the best solution, different runs were conducted by iterating over GP tuning parameters. The most important tuning parameters are maximum size of the chromosome, the number of generations, and population size. 30 The size of the chromosome, which governs the maximum length of the equation, was varied from 5 to 100. The population size was set to 1,000, and the number of generations was set to 500 million evolution steps divided into 100 stages.",

Hyperbolic tangent was used as the transfer function within the ANN (Figure 2). Recent works 39,40 demonstrate the ANN as a much coveted CI modeling tool. ANNs show plausible results in supervised learning, a behavior that can be attributed to the high generalization ability of the ANNs.

            "text": "Considering granule fraction range as a disposable input characteristic for the outcome of porosity is contrary to previous works, 43 but justified within the range of this training data set. 22 A comparison between the GP model and the ANN model shows that the average granule fraction size does not exercise significant effect on the outcome (Figure 5), also supported by MLR (Table 3). ANN model does not perform feature selection on its own and is bound to use all three inputs in the final model. Therefore, GP model discarding the average granule fraction size makes it less complex and improves performance on the external data set ( Table 2). Further RSM analysis based on the GP equation shows that variation in the amount of MCC does not have a profound effect on the porosity of the tablet, while an increase in the die compaction force considerably reduces the porosity of tablets ( Figure 6), a behavior that can be attributed to particle rearrangement followed by plastic deformation during the compression stage. 44 Feature selection on the external data set to establish the surplus of discarded variables Plausible performance of the trained CI models on a significantly different external data set could be an occurrence of chance. To study this in detail, important features from both the data sets were compared. Feature selection experiments using fscaret were run independently on the external data set. Confirmatory models were developed with a variation of input vectors using the tree-based learning method Cubist. The resulting top features of the external data set are in agreement with the features used to train the models. The results confirm that the die compaction force is the most important variable, with roll compaction force, roll compaction tooling,  percentage of material in the formulation, and granule fraction range displaying much lower ranking. Models developed without the information of roll compaction force, roll compaction tooling, and granule fraction range predict porosity of tablets accurately (Table 5: experiments with two and three inputs). The successful modeling shows that these variables do not contribute to the outcome within this design space. The results strongly suggest redundancies in the original data set, which, once removed, do not affect the prediction of porosity within the factor space. Correlation analysis of the original data set reveals that porosity is highly correlated to die compaction force (Figure 7).

The models exhibit reliable prediction behavior, with the best achieved 10cv-NRMSE of 1% on using ANNs. The models also exhibit understanding of the tableting process within the design space. The equation for porosity is presented as the result of symbolic regression models with 10cv-NRMSE of 4% and external validation NRMSE of 3%. Presentation of CI models in the form of an equation makes them transparent to scrutiny and shows how the input variables interact with each other plus contribute toward the specific outcome of porosity. Contrary to common knowledge, roll compaction parameters such as tooling and compression force do not influence the porosity of tablets. Such conclusions are confined to the local design space and cannot be treated as general rules governing the tableting process."
