            "text": "To report our intermediate experience in treating patients with severe incontinence using an adjustable perineal male sling with a tissue expander. Materials and Methods: An adjustable male sling procedure was performed on 21 patients with severe incontinence. The underlying etiology of urinary incontinence was radical prostatectomy in 13 patients, open prostatectomy in 5 patients and transurethral prostate resection in 3 patients. The difference between the classical and the adjustable sling is that in the latter there is a 25 mL tissue expander between the two layers of polypropylene mesh with an injection port. Adjustment of the sling was performed with saline via an inflation port, in case of recurrence or persistence of incontinence. Results: The mean age of the patients was 66.2\u00b17.3 (50-79) years and mean pad usage was 6.4\u00b10.6 per day. The mean follow-up time was 40.1\u00b123.2 (6-74) months. The balloon was postoperatively inflated on average with 11.6\u00b15.7 (5-25) mL. After the mean 40.1 months of follow-up, 16 of the 21 patients (76.2%) were dry (11 patients, 0 pads; 5 patients using safety pads), 3 patients (14%) had mild and 2 (9.8%) had moderate degree post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPI). The average maximum urine flow rate of the patients was 15.6\u00b14.7 (10-31) mL/s. No residual urine was found. In 2 patients, all parts of the device were removed due to infection and discomfort, and in 3 patients only the inflation component was removed due to local scrotal infection. Conclusions: Our results show that using an adjustable perineal male sling with a tissue expander seems to be an efficient, and safe surgical treatment option in patients with PPI."

            "text": "Male urinary incontinence is very distressing problem after prostatic surgery. It has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life (1). Post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPI) is a potential complication of prostate surgery and although it is more frequently seen after radical prostatectomy it can also occur after endoscopic or open surgery for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) (2). Initial management is usually conservative and includes the use of diapers or pads, penile clamps, or various collecting systems (such as a condom catheter). Mild degrees of PPI in the early postoperative period may be improved by pelvic muscle exercises, physiotherapy, and pharmacotherapy (3). However, for most patients who have moderate to severe PPI, conservative methods are not sufficient to return to their normal lives. Surgery is usually necessary to treat the more severe cases.",

After the insertion of a urethral catheter, a midline perineal incision of 40 to 50 mm was made. The critical point is not to remove periurethral fat tissues from urethra. Both sides of urethra were dissected down to the lower border of the pubic bone (Figure-1a). A Eurosilicone\u2122 (Laboratoires Eurosilicone, France) tissue expander device was used with an adjustable male sling in our patients.

During this procedure, attention must be paid not to damage the filled balloon. After the pocket was created, the balloon was evacuated. Third, the mesh was stapled on both sides of the lower border of the pubic bone using an Autosuture Stat TackTM (Tyco Healthcare, UK) stapler (Figure-1d). The original surgical method defined by Inci, et al. (5) used a polypropylene mesh that was fixed on the pubic bone with non-absorbable sutures.

The rising elderly population and the increasing number of surgical interventions for prostate cancer mean that the incidence of PPI will rise. Since its introduction in 1973, the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) has been considered the gold standard treatment for stress urinary incontinence after prostatectomy, offering the patient the greatest chance of a cure (6). The success rates of AUS range from 59 to 90% (7-9). Although, AUS is an effective and durable treatment, many patients are hesitant about implantation or refuse the procedure. Most patients could not manipulate the scrotal pump (10). Furthermore, AUS is expensive and requires a complex surgical procedure that is associated with significant rates of complications. A recent systematic review about AUS reported that infection or erosion occurred in 8.5% of cases (3.3-27.8%), mechanical failure in 6.2% (2-13.8%), and urethral atrophy in 7.9% (1.9-28.6%). Re-operation rate was reported to range from 14.8% to 44.8% (11).",

A bone anchored sling (BAS) compresses the bulbar urethra with a silicone-coated polypropylene mesh by attaching the sling to the inferior pubic ramus with bone screws. Following initial reports of degradation of organic materials, synthetic mesh (InVance\u2122, American Medical Systems, US) has become the most commonly utilized material with the BAS (17). Rajpurkar et al. (4) reported their results in 46 patients with PPI who undergo BAS implantation. In their study, the total cure rate was 37%. Furthermore, 37% of the patients significantly improved, and the treatment of 26% patients failed after an average of 24 months follow-up. They concluded that the male sling procedure is an effective and safe procedure for the management of stress urinary incontinence. However, it should not be considered as an alternative to AUS. Guimaraes et al. (18) reported their intermediate results of up to 4 years with the InVance\u2122 sling. Their cure rate was 65% and the improvement rate was 23% in 54 men with PPI after a mean follow-up of 28 months. The authors claimed that the InVance\u2122 sling offers a good intermediate cure and improvement rates with acceptably low rate of complications in patients suffering from PPI. Another study investigated the use of the InVance\u2122 sling in 40 patients with PPI (19). The cure rate was 55% at a mean follow-up of 35.2 months.

            "text": "The traditional BAS procedure does not provide for the adjustment of the tension of the sling material in the post-operative period and this can result in progressive failure over time. In a study by Castle et al. (1), 42 patients underwent the BAS procedure. Only 15.8% of the patients were completely dry and 39.5% were socially continent. Social continence was achieved in 67% 50% and 0% of mild, moderate and severe cases, respectively. Comiter (20) speculated that the surgeons left the fatty tissue over the bulbospongious intact, and additionally used a piece of porcine dermis between the urethra and the sling A combination of fat necrosis and absorption of the dermis over time likely contributes to diminution of the compression provided by the sling over the bulbar urethra. Onur et al. (21) reported a median time to recurrent incontinence as 3 months after BAS procedure. Similarly, Cespedes and Jacoby reported an early failure (within 6 months) in 5% of their patients (22). In another study (23), the authors retrospectively reported objective and subjective outcomes in 40 male patients who underwent BAS positioning for stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Patients with stress urinary incontinence due to radical retropubic prostatectomy (n=32), robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (n=3) and transurethral prostate resection (n=5) underwent the BAS procedure over a 5 years period. Previous anti-incontinence procedures, radiotherapy and transurethral procedures due to urethral stricture were performed in 5, 11 and 5 patients, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 35.2 months, 22 patients (55%) were cured, the condition of 5 patients (12.5%) improved and the treatment of 13 patients (32.5%) failed. The authors concluded that BAS is a simple and effective procedure that can produce immediate good results with low morbidity, especially when strictly selected patients are treated. Radiotherapy remains a strong predictor of failure.",

In that study an adjustable perineal male sling with a 10 mL tissue expander was implanted in 19 consecutive men with severe PPI. According to the results of that study, at a mean follow-up of 17.3 months 15 patients (78.9%) were completely dry and 2 (10.5%) improved significantly using only 1 to 2 pads per day. A total of 11 patients required volume adjustment injections. The average number of adjustments was 2 (range 1 to 3) and the average injected volume was 6.3 cc (range 5 to 10). Regarding the complications, 1 patient had a superficial wound infection, 1 patient required surgical revision due to infection and 8 patients reported mild to moderate perineal pain. The authors concluded that the short term results indicate that this minimally invasive technique seems to be safe and effective, and patient satisfaction appears to be high. The same group presented their long term results in the International Continence Society Annual Meeting 2013. In a study by Ergen and Ozdemir (24), 58 men underwent the same procedure as described above. The mean follow-up time was 52 months. The completely dry rate decreased from 78.9% to 58% in the long term period. The authors concluded that adjustable male sling using a 10 mL tissue expander is an effective method for severe PPI, in the early period, but the effectiveness gradually decreases in the long term.",

The success rate of the current study is better than that of the other studies mentioned above (5,24). A possible explanation for our high success rate may be associated with the high capacity of the silicone balloon. In our patients, we used a larger size of silicone balloon (25 mL) than the other two studies. Additionally, we used a stapler which allows the easier attachment of the polypropylene mesh on the lower border of the pubic bone in both sides. Although previous pelvic radiotherapy history has also been claimed to be a negative predictor of success rate in PPI surgery (19,23), 2 patients in current study whom had a previous history of pelvic radiotherapy were dry in the intermediate follow-up.",
