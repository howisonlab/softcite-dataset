A sample, however, may contain a number of distinct methylation patterns. For instance, cells of different types and in different developmental stages may have different methylation patterns. Alleles may be differentially methylated, which may partially explain that the large portions of epigenomes from single cell types are partially methylated, and may have major effects on transcriptional output. Approaches relying on DNA sequence polymorphism to identify individual patterns from a mixture of heterogeneous epigenomes are insufficient as methylcytosines occur at a much higher density than SNPs. Results: We have developed a mixture model-based approach for resolving distinct epigenomes from a heterogeneous sample. In particular, the model is applied to the detection of allele-specific methylation (ASM). The methods are tested on a synthetic methylome and applied to an Arabidopsis single root cell methylome.",

DNA methylation may repress or activate transcription, and is known to be involved in embryogenesis, genomic imprinting and tumorigenesis in mammals, and transposon silencing in plants (Bestor, 2000;Li et al., 1992;Lippman et al., 2004;Rhee et al., 2002;Zhang et al., 2006;Zilberman et al., 2007). To understand the regulation and dynamics of DNA methylation, the locations of the modified cytosines need to be identified. The first single-base resolution mappings of DNA methylation were produced for the whole Arabidopsis thaliana genome (Cokus et al., 2008;Lister et al., 2008) and for selected subsets of sites in the mouse genome (Meissner et al., 2008) using various bisulfite sequencing technologies. DNA methylation is the modification of DNA base cytosine (methylcytosine). A map of DNA methylation at single-base resolution is referred to as methylome or epigenome.",

A better understanding of methylation patterns in cancer genomes may lead to both new diagnostic markers and therapies based on the detection of methylation changes occurring early in tumorigenesis (Laird, 2003). In a tumor tissue particularly of an early stage, however, cancerous cells and normal cells are often mixed together. DNA methylation patterns can also act as markers for tracing stem cell expansion and tumor growth (Kim et al., 2005;Shibata and Tavar\u00e9, 2006;Yatabe et al., 2001). Making use of methylation patterns in this way requires determining methylation patterns associated with individual cells or cells from the same clone.",

Both IMR90 and H1 are of a single cell type. While it is expected that large portions (80%) of the X chromosome are partially methylated as the IMR90 cell line is from a female and the DNA methylation is known to play an important role in X chromosome inactivation (Riggs, 1975), it is unexpectedly observed that around 38% of IMR90 autosomes are identified as partially methylated domains (PMD). What is the nature of partial methylations in a single cell type? Might allelic differences contribute to the partial methylations? Answering these questions requires detecting allele-specific methylation (ASM) patterns.",

Applying methods for detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to methylation, however, may present difficulties. Methylcytosine is much more dynamic than nucleotides and observations generally suggest that methylation of a cytosine site is a statistical event. Unlike SNPs where a nucleotide occurs at a rate of 0, 50 or 100% in a diploid individual (if sequencing errors may be ignored), the methylation level at a particular site may fall anywhere in the range from 0% to 100%. Whether a methylcytosine is allele-specific therefore cannot be determined by the site alone. It needs supporting evidence from the neighboring nucleotides.",

            "text": "If a partially methylated cytosine is in the close vicinity of a SNP such that reads are long enough to cover both sites, then it is straightforward to determine from which allele the reads are originated thus determining the methylation level of the respective alleles. Some studies have shown that ASM is associated with SNPs (Kerkel et al., 2008;Shoemaker et al., 2010). The density of methylation across the whole genome, however, is much higher than that of DNA sequence polymorphism. For instance, while there are close to 3 million SNPs discovered in the human genome \u223c62 million and 45 million methylcytosines were detected in H1 and IMR90 cells . It has also been observed that changes in cytosine methylation occur at a frequency much greater than that of the DNA sequence mutations (Ossowski et al., 2010;Schmitz et al., 2011). As a result, SNPs are absent in large portions of the methylomes. We will describe a method in this article that detects ASM without the assistance of SNPs. In addition, even though the functionalities of ASM are not well understood except that they play an important role in imprinting (Hellman and Chess, 2007;Kerkel et al., 2008), it seems that the methylation level of an individual cytosine is less important than the overall levels of methylations within a region, which is also in contrast to the SNPs. We, therefore, focus our effort in detecting regions of ASM.",

The sequence of nucleotides (reads) in the converted fragments are subsequently determined by a sequencer. The reads produced by the sequencer are aligned to a reference genome. Usually only uniquely mapped reads are retained. As a result, what we have is a set of reads that are most similar in sequence to their respective mapped locations in the reference genome, which are presumably the genomic origins of the fragments that produced the reads. In addition, each cytosine on every mapped read is labeled as either methylated or unmethylated. The methylation level of a particular cytosine is computed as follows: if there are x reads that map to the position, and y out of the x reads have at this position a methylcytosine, then the methylation level is y/x. Note that if the read depth at a cytosine position is below a certain threshold, which is determined by the allowed false positive rate, the methylation is not called, i.e. y = 0. (Lister et al., 2008) If the original sample is composed of a mixture of epigenomes, be it from a set of different cell types, tissues or alleles, the mapped reads will reflect the mixture. Our goal is to infer the original makeup of the mixture from the mapped reads. It should be noted that the attainment of the goal depends on whether the original epigenomes are sufficiently heterogeneous so that we may distinguish them.",

It generally refers to a significant difference between the methylation levels of the two alleles. First, the methylome of a diploid individual is scanned for partially methylated regions (PMRs) as candidates for further analysis. Second, for each candidate region, the reads that align to this region are computationally assigned to the two alleles and the methylation levels of individual cytosines from each allele are estimated. Last, regions are classified to allele-specific or nonspecific methylated regions, based on read assignments and the predicted methylation levels from the previous step. A synthetic methylome is used to test the model and to illustrate the details of each step. We remark that determining whether a read along with its methylcytosines has a higher probability to originate from one allele or the other relies on the differences between the reads, i.e. the methylation states of the cytosines on the reads. The density of methylcytosines of a genome relative to the read length in a sequencing experiment is therefore critical. For instance, if, on average, a read covers at most one methylcytosine, then there is very little hope to deconvolve the allelic methylation states without additional information. While anticipating the rapid growth of the read length in high-throughput sequencing technology, we first tested our method on Arabidopsis thaliana, which has a reasonably high methylation density. The median genomic distance, for instance, between consecutive methylcytosines on Chromosome 1 of A. thaliana Col-0 is 15, while the typical read length of an Illumina sequencer is between 100 and 150 bp presently.",

Each CMR is scanned with a fixed-width sliding window where the window width is the number of methylcytosines. A fixed-width window inside a CMR is classified as a PMR if no fewer than 90% of the methylcytosines are at most 70% methylated . A PMR may be called with or without a specific lower bound for methylation levels. In the data we have analyzed, the average level of methylations in a CMR is at least 25%, due to that (i) the region has contiguous methylcytosines; (ii) the allowed false positive rate for calling a methylcytosine (Lister et al., 2008) in combination with the sequencing coverage dictates an implicit lower bound on the methylation levels.

Recall that we used a rather simplistic rule to automatically label the samples in the synthetic methylome when preparing the training and testing samples. The labels are derived from the knowledge of the two individual methylomes making up the synthetic methylome, and therefore are independent of the predictions made by the mixture model. One option is to use the same rule to classify a region from predicted methylation levels. We hope to capture more characteristics of the two classes, however, so multiple measures are employed for this task when it is applied to the real epigenome. We also use the synthetic methylome to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that is later used for a real single cell methylome. Notice that the value a rj gives the probability that the read r is from allele j. If a read needs to be assigned to a single allele, it should be assigned to the j that has the larger value of a rj , or formally, to cluster j r = argmax j (a rj ). The features for SVM are extracted from the estimated methylation levels (M ) and allele frequencies (C). A total of nine features are used (details omitted due to exigencies of space). Both linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels are tested; the latter yield better performance. Five-fold cross-validation is used to select the best parameters for the kernel function from each training set. The testing results are shown in Table 2. In some of the false positive (FP) samples, both cells have completely unmethylated reads and these reads are clustered together in the synthetic methylome, which are then classified as allele-specific (cell-specific).

In particular, we applied this model to identify allele-specific methylated regions. The reads from potentially multiple epigenomes are mapped to a common reference genome. The goal is essentially to infer the distinct methylation patterns from the mapped reads. Our approach is different from previous attempts in that it does not rely on SNPs, which are few and far between when compared with methylcytosines. The model was tested on a synthetic methylome. The classification based on the mixture model in conjunction with an SVM classifier yielded an accuracy of 87.5%. Even though the SVM approach is not always applicable to real methylomes, since all the features are derived from the predicted methylation levels and cluster frequencies, the test results reflect the reliability of the predictions made by the model. Additional multiple filters for ASMs may further reduce the number of false positives.",

By taking advantage of pair-end reads and other information, it will also be possible to do phasing and extend and connect the regions. Our model assumes that methylations are independent of each other. Methylations in some regions have a tendency to occur in clusters, which indicates a certain dependency. While our model gives a reasonably good first-order approximation, Markov chain-based models perhaps may be explored to take the dependency into consideration. Identifying ASM is still only at initial research stages. Another direction for future research is to focus on understanding the functionalities of ASM, for instance, how they are related to allele-specific expression.",
