Higher (p<0.05) superoxide dismutase activity and total reducing ability were maintained in VSP-MOMAP beef than in HOMAP beef. Lipid oxidation (2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) was significantly (p<0.05) retarded in MOMAP, VSP-MOMAP, and VSP-HOMAP beef compared with HOMAP beef. Production of nonheme iron content was lower (p<0.05) in VSP-MOMAP beef than in HOMAP beef. Red color (a*) was kept higher (p<0.05) in VSP-MOMAP beef compared with MOMAP, HOMAP, and VSP-HOMAP beef. However, VACP beef was found to have the most positive effects on the antioxidant activity, oxidation and red color stabilities among the various packaged beef. These findings suggested that VSP-MOMAP was second to VACP in improving oxidation and color stabilities in sliced beef loin during chill storage."

            "text": "The VACP, the most popular packaging system for aging of fresh meat, with little oxygen environment inside the pack, has a beneficial effect on prevention of oxidation, flavor preservation, and inhibition of microbial growth but gives rise to unacceptable color due to development of deoxymyoglobin and deformation of shape (Borch et al., 1996;Santos et al., 2005;Troy and Kerry, 2010;Avil\u00e9s et al., 2014). The VSP improves the appearance together with color stability and slows the growth rate of microorganisms compared to VACP (Barros-Vel\u00e1zquez et al., 2003;V\u00e1zquez et al., 2004). The MAP has the advantages of better color stability and microorganism control owing to filling with oxygen (O 2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) inside the pack (Lopez-Lorenzo et al., 1980;Gill and Harrison, 1989). In retail fresh meat, high oxygen-MAP (70% to 80% O 2 /20% to 30% CO 2 ; HOMAP) is the most effective in stabilizing color but entails the oxidative deterioration (Jakobsen and Bertelsen, 2000;Lund et al., 2007b). Recently, the more advanced type of HOMAP combined with VSP has been industrially developed for the purpose of extending shelflife of fresh meat as compared to HOMAP alone.",

During storage of meat, lipid oxidation, which is originated by contact with oxygen, creates free radicals contributing to the oxidation of myoglobin and protein (Xiong, 2000;Faustman et al., 2010). This oxidation process negatively affects the quality of meat. The accumulation of metmyoglobin on the surface of meat causes the consumer's refusal to purchase and economic loss of retail (Smith et al., 2000). The oxidation of meat protein incurs the development of carbonyls, hydroperoxides, and sulfoxides, deterioration of texture, and decline in water-holding capacity (Davies and Dean, 2003;Morzel et al., 2006). Thus, to keep the quality of the raw meat, a decrease in oxidation stability should be prevented as much as possible.",

Several studies have reported the inhibitory effect of the enzymatic antioxidant system, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), on the lipid oxidation of meat (Mei et al., 1994;Lee et al., 1996). The endogenous antioxidant enzymes in the meat are affected by various factors, such as feed, pre-slaughter stress, packaging and processing, etc. (Mercier et al., 2004;Chen et al., 2010;Gheisari and Motamedi, 2010;Kang et al., 2012). Particularly, in a previous study on the beef packaged with modified atmosphere, Kang et al. (2012) found that increasing O 2 concentration accelerated the lipid oxidation and browning of color due to a decrease in the activity of some antioxidant enzyme. However, there have been few researches reported on the comparison of antioxidant enzymes, lipid and protein oxidation, and color among VACP, O 2 -MAP alone, and O 2 -MAP combined with VSP during storage. This research was, therefore, conducted to estimate the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and oxidation and color stabilities in sliced Hanwoo (Korean cattle) beef loin in various packaging systems during chill storage.",

The sliced beef stored under VACP had higher (p<0.05) catalase activity  However, there were not significant differences for catalase activity by both O 2 concentration in MAP and combination with VSP. Whereas, the activities of GPx and SOD in the stored-sliced beef were influenced by both packaging system (p<0.05 and p = 0.001) and storage time (p<0.001), there were no significant (p>0.05) effects due to their interaction ( Table 1). The activity of GPx decreased (p<0.05) in the sliced beef stored under MOMAP, VSP-MOMAP, and HOMAP during storage (Figure 1). At d 14, the sliced beef stored under VACP had higher (p<0.05) GPx activity than the beef stored under HOMAP. A decrease (p<0.05) in SOD activity was indicated in the sliced beef stored under all packaging systems (Figure 1). Compared with the other packaging systems, the sliced beef stored under VACP had higher (p<0.05) SOD activity at d 14. At the same storage time, the sliced beef stored under both MOMAP and VSP-MOMAP had higher (p<0.05) SOD activity compared with the beef stored under both HOMAP and VSP-HOMAP. But combination with VSP did not influence GPx and SOD activities in the sliced beef at d 14 of storage. These results imply that higher O 2 atmosphere in a packaging system decreased the activities of antioxidant enzymes in the stored-sliced beef. Previously, Kang et al. (2012) reported a similar finding which the activity of some antioxidant enzyme in the chopped beef was decreased by an increase in O 2 concentration in MAP for 8 d. This phenomenon may be partially due to decomposed or denatured antioxidant enzymes by oxidation promoted by exposure to higher O 2 atmosphere.",

The sliced beef stored under VACP had higher (p<0.05) TRA than the beef stored under the other packaging systems for 14 d of storage. Combination with O 2 -MAP and VSP gave a tendency to maintain higher TRA in the stored-sliced beef than O 2 -MAP alone. However, the sliced beef stored under VSP-MOMAP had higher (p<0.05) TRA than the beef stored under HOMAP from 7 d and indicated higher (p<0.05) TRA than the beef stored under VSP-HOMAP at d 14. Liu et al. (2014) reported similar results where the beef steak stored under VACP or carbon monoxide-MAP had higher TRA compared with the steak stored under HOMAP for 14 d. The decreased TRA in the higher O 2 packaging system may be due to consumption of reducing components for oxymyoglobin stabilization (Seyfert et al., 2007) or destruction of endogenous antioxidants, such as vitamins, thiols, polyamines, and peptides, by oxidation process (Decker et al., 2000;Clausen et al., 2009).",

The sliced beef stored under VACP maintained lower (p<0.05) TBARS content for 14 d of storage compared with the beef stored under the other packaging systems. From 7 d, the sliced beef stored under MOMAP, VSP-MOMAP, and VSP-HOMAP had lower (p<0.05) TBARS content than the beef stored under HOMAP. This result is in agreement with a report of O'Grady et al. 2000who found that a higher O 2 packaging system increased the TBARS content in the minced beef for 10 d. In addition, Franco et al. (2012) also reported that the beef steak stored under VACP had lower TBARS content for 10 d compared with the steak stored under HOMAP. In the present study, packaging together with VSP delayed the development of TBARS in the sliced beef stored under O 2 atmosphere packaging. This could be attributed to the fact that VSP blocked the direct exposure of beef to O 2 atmosphere.",

Carbonyl content increased (p<0.05) in the sliced beef stored under all packaging systems during storage (Figure 4). In our results, the sliced beef stored under VACP, MOMAP, and VSP-MOMAP showed a tendency to have lower carbonyl content compared with the beef stored under HOMAP for 14 d. However, at only d 7 of storage, there were significant (p<0.05) differences in carbonyl content among the storage systems. The generation of protein carbonyls in the meat products is initiated and accelerated by lipid oxidation (Butterfield and Stadtman, 1997;Xiong, 2000). To explain in more detail, following the creation of radicals from protein or amino acids (arginine, cysteine, histidine, lysine, methionine, proline, serine, tryptophan, and valine) by attack of hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) produced during the oxidation process of unsaturated fatty acids, a peroxy radical product is created by reaction with former radicals and oxygen and then finally develops carbonyls through further oxidative processes with reactive oxygen species or metal ions. Thus, a rapid increase in lipid oxidation by higher O 2 packaging may promote the generation of carbonyls and this increase in carbonyl content with lipid oxidation appeared at d 7 of storage in our study. This is supported by a previous study of Lund et al. (2007a) who reported that beef patties stored under HOMAP had higher carbonyl and TBARS contents at 6 d compared with the patties stored under 100% N 2 -MAP. Furthermore, our result at d 14 of storage is similar with another finding of Lund et al. (2007b) who reported that the carbonyl content was not different between sliced meat stored under either HOMAP and VSP at d 14. They explained that this phenomenon is because of the advanced reaction of carbonyls. According to Xiong and Decker (1995), carbonyls cause the cross-linking of proteins, resulting in aggregation, polymerization, and insolubilization, via formation of Schiff base with free amino acids. Our result may be due to their proven mechanism and is also supported by a study of Lund et al. (2007b) who observed higher protein cross-linkage in HOMAP compared with VSP.",

During storage, the a* value rapidly decreased (p<0.05) in the sliced beef stored under Ox-MAP, but little changed in the beef stored under VACP (Figure 5). Compared with the sliced beef stored under the other packaging systems, the beef stored under VACP had lower (p<0.05) a* value up to 3 d of storage and further storage to 14 d resulted in higher (p<0.05) a* value. From 7 d of storage, the sliced beef stored under VSP-MOMAP presented a higher a* value than the beef stored under both HOMAP, and VSP-HOMAP. Moreover, it had higher (p<0.05) a* value than the beef stored under MOMAP from10 d of storage. The sliced beef stored under VSP-HOMAP indicated a tendency to have higher a* value than the beef stored under HOMAP during storage. Lindahl (2011) also observed the deterioration of red color in the beef steak stored under HOMAP. In a previous study by Li   2012, a similar finding of maintenance of red color in the sliced beef stored under VSP has been reported. In the stored fresh meat, the decrease of red color is caused by oxidation of oxymyoglobin to metmyoglobin and is elevated by lipid oxidation (Faustman et al., 2010). In the present study, higher O 2 packaging accelerated the deterioration of red color in the sliced beef but VSP retarded the decrease of red color by O 2 atmosphere. Thus, this result may be related with different developments of TBARS by packaging systems.",

Nonheme iron content increased (p<0.05) in the sliced beef stored under all packaging systems at d 14 of storage (Figure 6). At the same storage time, the sliced beef stored under VACP had lower (p<0.05) nonheme iron content compared with the beef stored under the other packaging systems. Moreover, the beef stored under VSP-MOMAP had lower (p<0.05) nonheme iron content than the beef stored under HOMAP. Nonheme iron, i.e. free ion, is created by reaction of metmyoglobin with lipid hydroperoxides or H 2 O 2 and has a direct relationship with lipid oxidation because of initiation and propagation by production of free radicals through Penton's reaction (Harel and Kanner, 1985;Reeder and Wilson, 1998;Min and Ahn, 2005;Muhlisin et al., 2013). Thus, based on our results with this mechanism, the nonheme iron content in the storedsliced beef may be highly correlated with activities of antioxidant enzymes, TRA, meat redness and degree of lipid oxidation as affected by packaging systems.",
