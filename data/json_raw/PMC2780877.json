As oxidative stress has been associated with microvascular complications, we evaluated the relationship between Hp genotype and microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and early renal function decline in type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Participants from the Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study with DNA available were studied for the incidence of microalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate [AER] 20-200 g/min), macroalbuminuria (AER \u03fe200 g/min), ESRD (renal dialysis or transplantation), and renal function decline (a decline \u054630 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 from baseline estimated [by the Cockcroft-Gault equation] glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] in those with baseline eGFR \u03fe60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). RESULTS-The proportions with the Hp 2/2, 2/1, and 1/1 genotype were 43.4, 44.4, and 12.1%, respectively. During 18 years of follow-up, the incidence of eGFR decline, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, and ESRD was 42.0, 40.5, 16.7, and 12.2%, respectively. No significant univariate differences were observed by Hp genotype. However, in multivariable Cox models, an \u03f3twofold increased risk was observed for the Hp 2/2 compared with the Hp 1/1 genotype for eGFR decline (hazard ratio 1.79 [95% CI 1.06-3.00]) and ESRD (2.74 [1.17-6.45]); no significant associations were observed for microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. CONCLUSIONS-These data suggest that although Hp genotype is not associated with albuminuria per se, it may be an independent determinant of early renal function decline and progression to ESRD. Understanding these apparent contradictory findings may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of renal disease in type 1 diabetes."

            "text": "It has recently been proposed that the effectiveness of an antioxidant regimen may be limited to susceptible subgroups, such as individuals with the haptoglobin (Hp) 2/2 genotype (3). Hp is an acute-phase plasma \u2423 2glycoprotein that, by binding to free Hb, inhibits Hbinduced oxidative tissue damage (4). Once bound to Hp, the Hp-Hb complex is cleared from circulation either at the liver hepatocyte or through the scavenger receptor CD163 present on monocytes and macrophages (5). In humans, two common allele classes (Hp 1 and Hp 2 ) at the Hp locus on chromosome 16q22 form three major genotypes: Hp 1/1, Hp 2/1, and Hp 2/2 (4). Substantial evidence supports a pathogenetic role of this polymorphism (6), with the Hp 1 protein allele being more efficient in preventing heme release from Hp-Hb complexes and promoting uptake by the CD163 macrophage receptor (7)(8)(9) as well as the antioxidant capacity of Hp 2 allele protein product being restricted by its greater molecular mass (5) and also associated with impaired reverse cholesterol transport (7,10). Moreover, although Hp allele distribution does not differ by diabetes status (6), the Hp 2 allele protein product increases susceptibility to vascular complications only in diabetes (11,12). Finally, daily vitamin E supplementation in type 2 diabetes with the Hp 2/2 genotype significantly reduced cardiovascular event risk (13,14).",

However, although not univariately significant, approximately a twofold increased risk emerged for outcomes assessing renal function decline and ESRD incidence after multivariable adjustments. Previous studies assessing the association between the Hp phenotype and the presence or incidence of renal disease have produced discrepant findings. In a small, cross-sectional study of normotensive subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes, none of those with the Hp 1/1 phenotype exhibited signs of nephropathy (0/18) compared with 27% (10/37) of those with Hp 2/1 and 34% (19/55) of those with Hp 2/2 (P \u03fd 0.02) (6,28). Similar results were reported from an Irish type 1 diabetes case-control study (29). Conversely, a Japanese study of individuals with a long duration (\u03fe10 years) of type 2 diabetes did not observe an increased risk associated with the common Hp phenotype (P \u03ed 0.43) (30). Similarly, we were also not able to detect an association for either microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria incidence in our cohort of individuals with a long duration of type 1 diabetes, perhaps suggesting that at a more advanced stage of diabetes, early Hp-susceptible cases of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria may have been excluded. Indeed, the cumulative incidence of microalbuminuria (including both prevalent cases at study entry and incident cases) appeared higher in our study among participants carrying the Hp 2 allele, although results did not reach statistical significance. However, analogous findings were not observed for the cumulative incidence of macroalbuminuria, suggesting that the Hp 2/2 genotype is not a strong determining factor for progression to macroalbuminuria.",

            "text": "Despite the null associations for the incidence of proteinuria, a strong relationship was noted between the Hp 2/2 genotype and the incidence of both an early decline in renal function and ESRD. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any published reports on the association between the Hp genotype and renal function decline among individuals with diabetes and thus cannot, at present, confirm these findings. However, the possibility of a factor affecting the incidence of renal dysfunction but not that of renal disease per se raises the hypothesis that these are two different disease entities, and thus factors contributing to their development may be distinct. Indeed, almost a decade ago, we suggested that in certain cases tubulopathy may precede glomerulopathy in type 1 diabetes and that even microalbuminuria may be secondary to impaired tubular reabsorption (31). More recently, research studies have shown that reductions in eGFR do occur without preceding microalbuminuria in those with diabetes (32)(33)(34). Importantly, a pathophysiological mechanism has been proposed that could account for the increased rate of renal function decline among individuals with diabetes and the 508.736 Model 1 allowed for diabetes duration, sex, smoking status, log AER, and eGFR Model 2 allowed for variables in model 1 in addition to HbA 1 , hypertension, and HDL and non-HDL cholesterol Model 3 allowed for variables in model 2 in addition to white blood cell count and fibrinogen Hp 2/2 genotype (7), based on the recognition that renal proximal tubule cells serve as a (secondary to CD163) default mechanism for clearance of the Hp-Hb complex. Because CD163-mediated clearance of the Hp-Hb complex is impaired in subjects with diabetes and the Hp 2/2 genotype, renal proximal tubule cells are used to a greater extent, resulting in a dramatic increase in iron deposition, oxidative stress, and hypertrophy. In fact, Hp 2/2 diabetic mice have been shown to display significantly increased glomerular and proximal tubular hypertrophy and greater deposition of collagen type IV, smooth muscle actin, and increased renal iron (35). Intriguingly, vitamin E administration was shown to slow diabetic renal disease progression among the Hp 2/2 but not the Hp 1/1 mice.",
