In this study, we investigated whether early structural and functional cardiac changes occur in patients with COPD devoid of manifest cardiovascular disease, and we assessed their associations with clinical and functional features. Methods: Forty-nine patients with COPD belonging to all Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classes were enrolled and compared with 36 controls. All subjects underwent clinical history assessment, lung function testing, blood pressure measurement, electrocardiography, and conventional and Doppler tissue echocardiography. Patients were also subjected to computed tomography to quantify emphysema score. Results: Patients with COPD had lower LV cavity associated with a marked increase in relative wall thickness (RWT), suggesting concentric remodeling without significant changes in LV mass. RWT was significantly associated with ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second to the forced vital capacity and emphysema score and was the only cardiac parameter that-after multivariate analysis-significantly correlated with COPD conditions in all individuals. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that RWT (with a cutoff point of 0.42) predicted the severity of COPD with 83% specificity and 56% sensitivity (area under the curve =0.69, 95% confidence interval =0.59-0.81). Patients with COPD showed right ventricular to be functional but no structural changes. Conclusion: Patients with COPD without evident cardiovascular disease exhibit significant changes in LV geometry, resulting in concentric remodeling. In all individuals, RWT was significantly and independently related to COPD. However, its prognostic role should be determined in future studies.",

            "text": "COPD is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. 1 Extrapulmonary alterations, notably cardiac complications such as cor pulmonale, can be frequently observed in patients with COPD. In addition, coronary artery disease and heart failure may play important roles in mortality and morbidity in patients with COPD. 2 Cardiovascular complications might not only be related to CODP itself but could also be due to a chronic systemic inflammatory condition, in which heart and lungs are differentially involved. 3 Interestingly, changes in left ventricle function and structure such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diastolic dysfunction, and reduction in cardiac chambers and stroke volume have been described but might not be exclusively due to COPD. [4][5][6] The lower preload caused by hyperinflation may be responsible for reduced left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) dimensions 4,5 yet, a causal link between COPD and increased LV mass (LVM) 6 has not been clearly established. Notably, these authors demonstrated a higher (30% versus 20% in controls) prevalence of LVH in normoxemic, normotensive patients with COPD, unrelated to forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ). In that study, relative wall thickness (RWT) value (an index of LV geometry) was similar between patients with COPD and controls. 6 Chronic inflammation or pronounced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system rather than airway obstruction could play major yet unclear roles.",

It is noteworthy that our results are in agreement with those previously reported by echocardiography 18 with the highly sophisticated technique -nuclear magnetic resonance. 4 Differences in the selection criteria may explain these discrepancies. For example, unlike the study by Anderson et al, 6 our patients belonged to all GOLD classes. Moreover, our population included only patients with grade 1 hypertension, treated mostly by monotherapy. We excluded hypertensive patients affected by grades 2 and 3 hypertension. A greater systolic BP in COPD versus controls, as demonstrated by the ambulatory and 24-hour monitoring and the number of antihypertensive-per-treated patients with COPD (median =2), has also been reported by Anderson et al. 6 In addition, the age differences in our cohort were low (mean difference ~3 years), albeit weakly statistically significant. By contrast, in the study by Anderson et al, 6 the COPD group was, on average, 10 years older than the controls. This ~10-year age difference between the two groups may be critical because population studies report that age is a strong determinant of LVM, independent of height, weight, and sex, both in Table 7 Multiple regression analysis of the predicting relationship of COPD status with the echocardiographic-based variables, ie, rWT, eDV, eDD, and sWT  childhood and in adults. 19,20 In turn, the previously observed differences in LVM between COPD and controls could be mainly related to the different ages of the two groups. Although we did not find any difference in LVH between the two groups, our patients with COPD exhibited a significant increase in RWT as compared with controls. This is crucial to stratify cardiovascular risk in the general population, as a concentric LV remodeling (normal LV mass with increased RWT) is a well-known negative prognostic factor. 7,17 As previously demonstrated by Barr et al, 16 the extent of emphysema on CT scanning was linearly related to cardiac dimensions expressed by EDD and EDV: a greater magnitude of emphysema corresponds to a greater reduction in LV cavity size. Several explanations have been proposed to explain the relationship between COPD and microcardia. First, there is a lower preload in left cardiac chambers mediated by an intrathoracic hypovolemia and a decrease of the pulmonary vascular bed caused by dynamic hyperinflation. 4 This mechanism may explain not only the reductions in LV diameters and volumes but also the lower stroke volumes 16 and the supposed LV diastolic dysfunction found at the transmitral Doppler analysis. 21 Indeed, the inflow pattern is not only an index of ventricular relaxation and compliance, but it is also influenced by others variables such as the preload and the HR. A lower preload can mimic an impaired LV relaxation in normal functioning heart. 22 More sophisticated techniques, such as DTE, which analyzes the contraction and relaxation velocities directly on the myocardium, are less influenced by ventricular loads and provide more sensitive indexes of diastolic function. [22][23][24] In our study, the E/A ratio from the mitral inflow pattern was significantly reduced in COPD, but the myocardial S-and E\u2032-waves were preserved, excluding an impairment in the LV systolic and diastolic function.",

Our findings are in agreement with previous studies 4,5 that found even smaller RV secondary to the hyperinflation and subsequent lower preload to both heart chambers. In addition, patients with COPD had impaired RV systolic and diastolic functions, as demonstrated by the significant reductions of S-and E\u2032-waves, which were significantly related only to pulmonary artery pressure but not to CT score or FEV 1 /FVC. In summary, we report structural and functional cardiac changes in COPD, but only RWT was independently related to the COPD condition (after multivariate analysis).",

The prognostic role of RWT was also assessed in relation to respiratory and cardiac hospitalizations: only after the univariate statistics, but not after multivariate Poisson analysis, cardiac geometry was significantly related to this event, with age and FEV 1 /FVC being the only strong predictors. These analyses did not show LV geometry as morbidity predictor, confirming the role of age and clinical variables; however, we speculate that, in a larger series of patients, this structural cardiac index may prove a useful marker of hospitalization risk. During the follow-up, seven deaths occurred, but, owing to the limited number of fatal events, overall patient survival was not considered in the statistical analysis. However, the comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors revealed that RWT was significantly higher (0.52 versus 0.42, P=0.014) in nonsurvivors, suggesting its potential prognostic value as mortality predictor, which has to be confirmed in the future with a greater number of fatal events.",
