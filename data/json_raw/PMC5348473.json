Methods: The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were utilized to measure the MAGI1 expression level in GC tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to ensure the MAGI1 expression in GC cell lines. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) was applied for knockdown of endogenous MAGI1 in GC cells. MTT assay and colony formation assay, scratch wounding migration assay and transwell chamber migration assay, as well as transwell chamber invasion assay were employed respectively to investigate the GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in MAGI1-knockdown and control GC cells. The potential molecular mechanism mediated by MAGI1 was studied using Western blotting and RT-PCR. Results: RT-PCR and IHC verified MAGI1 was frequently expressed in matched adjacent noncancerous mucosa compared with GC tissues and the expression of MAGI1 was related to clinical pathological parameters. Functional assays indicated that MAGI1 knockdown significantly promoted GC cell migration and invasion. Further mechanism investigation demonstrated that one pathway of MAGI1 inhibiting migration and invasion was mainly by altering the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)related molecules via inhibiting MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Conclusions: MAGI1 was associated with GC clinical pathological parameters and acted as a tumor suppressor via inhibiting of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in GC.",

            "text": "Gastric cancer (GC) remains one of the most common malignancies and is responsible for the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in China (1). Because the early Original Article stages of GC are normally asymptomatic and a majority of GC patients are often diagnosed in advanced stages, there is still high morbidity and mortality of GC patients (2). Metastasis is recognized as an essential factor that responsible for the poor prognosis in GC. However, it's most regrettable that so far no efficient target drug has been reported to directly inhibit the process of metastasis. Therefore, a better understanding of the clinical biomarkers and the molecular underpinnings involved in metastasis still remains challenging, and it is an urgent task for further GC therapy (3,4).",

            "text": "Membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted 1 (MAGI1) is a member that belongs to MAGI subfamily of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. MAGI2 and MAGI3 are two other close members in the MAGI subfamily, which contain similar molecular structures to MAGI1 (5). Previous reports have demonstrated that MAGI1 was down-regulated in diverse cancers and acted as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and cervical cancer (6)(7)(8). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of MAGI1 in inhibiting metastasis were disparate in different kinds of cancers. Zhang et al. demonstrated that MAGI1 inhibited cell migration and invasion by up-regulating the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in hepatocellular carcinoma, and a similar result was found by Hu et al. in the study of MAGI2, another MAGI family member in the same cancer (9,10). In addition, MAGI1 could also interact with some proteins by its different PDZ (PSD-95, DLG, ZO-1) domains to further alter the expression level of these proteins. The interacted proteins always have special functions in the biological process such as cell junction, adhesion and invasion. For instance, Dobrosotskaya et al. demonstrated that MAGI1 interacted with \u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin during the formation of cell-cell junctions in MDCK cells. Ridgway et al. also revealed that MAGI1 could also regulate the steady-stage of the surface BK(Ca) channels by the interaction with Slo1 (11,12). Other MAGI family members were also revealed to regulate cell migration and invasion via some signaling pathways such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and PI3K/PKB (13)(14)(15). Although metastasis is likely to be the main biological process regulated by MAGI1, the other biological occurrence and progression are also increasingly reported in recent years. Zaric et al. indicated that overexpression of MAGI1 repressed not only cell metastasis but the proliferation by inhibiting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in colorectal cancer, and in some cases, MAGI1 could also participate in the regulation of apoptosis (6,8). Ma et al. even suggested MAGI3 suppressed cell proliferation via up-regulating PTEN expression in galioma, a similar way of MAGI1 and MAGI2 inhibiting cell migration and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (16). Although previous reports have already revealed the role of MAGI and its family members in different tumor types, there were few reports to confirm the biological function of MAGI1 in GC. Hence, this study aims to clarify the biological role of MAGI1 in GC and to provide further understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediated by MAGI1 in GC.",

Though new drugs have emerged increasingly with the combination of the latest clinical researches and already been shown to alleviate the progression of GC, whereas they still fail to develop efficient target drugs that directly reduced the progression of metastasis in GC treatment because of the complexity in these series of biological processes (21). Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the GC metastasis is an urgent requirement to develop effective therapeutic drugs. From the outset of this study, we confirmed the downregulation of MAGI1 in GC tissues and GC cell lines. This is in agreement with the previous studies in colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and cervical cancer (6)(7)(8)(9). Further analysis on the relationship between MAGI1 expression and clinicalpathological parameters indicated that the MAGI1 expression was significantly associated with pathological typing, degree of differentiation and distant metastasis in GC patients. Pathological typing and differentiation are not only utilized to reflect the tumor biological behavior, but also important for the better evaluation of pathogenesis, potential characteristics of the related disease and even the patient prognosis (22,23). Our results found that MAGI1 was more frequently expressed in the moderately-well differentiated intestinal or mixed GC types than the poorly differentiated diffused ones. Because diffused GC always origins from gastric mucosa with poor differentiation and is especially characterized as absence of cell junction, our result was potentially consistent with the biological functions of MAGI1 that had been demonstrated by previous studies, such as the functions of maintaining cell-cell junctions and cell adhesion (11,12).",

MAGI1 knockdown promoted migration and invasion in GC cells, but its influence on the cell proliferation was limited. Our study was partially in agreement with the previous study which investigated MAGI1 in other kinds of cancer, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (10). Based on the functional analysis, we further investigated the potential molecular mechanism on metastasis progression that mediated by MAGI1. Our studies demonstrated that MAGI1 not only repressed the expression of MMPs, especially MMP7 and MMP9, but also altered the expression of typical EMT molecules (suppressed N-cadherin expression and enhanced E-cadherin expression), and then inhibited the migration and invasion of GC cells. MMPs and EMT are two types of essential pathways that commonly participate in metastasis progression in different tumor types (24)(25)(26). MMP family plays an important role in extracellular matrix remodeling, which is implicated to have the ability to accelerate tumor aggressiveness in various cancers (27,28). EMT is another key process along with cell phenotypic changes to achieve the migration and invasion ability, and thus finally promote the metastasis progression (29). However, the early initiations of these two essential pathways are always mediated by different signaling transduction pathways in different tumor types. MAPK is one of the important families that is always constitutively activated in cancers and mediates the signaling transduction pathways to regulate different biological processes such as proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis in various cancers, in addition, ERK, JNK and p38 are three main sub-members of MAPK (30)(31)(32). Previous studies revealed that the expression of MAGI family members was correlated with the further regulation of MAPK signaling pathways, whereas which MAPK family signaling pathway being specifically regulated was mainly depended on the MAGI family member types or tumor types. Zhang et al. indicated that silencing of MAGI3, another member of MAGI family with particular similar molecular structure to MAGI1, could inhibit LPA2-induced ERK signaling pathway in colon cancer cells (33). Besides, MAGI3 was also found to regulate ERK signaling pathway though \u03b22-adrenoreceptor (\u03b22AR) in COS-7 cell model and the inhibition of JNK signaling pathway by MAGI3 was demonstrated in HEK293 cell model (34,35). In this study, we detected these three main signaling pathways of MAPK family and revealed that knockdown of MAGI1 could only activate ERK signaling pathway, but not JNK or p38 signaling pathway in AGS GC cells, which was similar to the previous studies in colon cancer cells and COS-7 cell model. The role of ERK signaling pathway in regulating cell biological behavior was complicated, and ERK signaling pathway was reported that it functioned as a trigger signal to further accelerate some biological processes such as proliferation, migration and invasion. One way of ERK signaling pathway involved in invasion and metastasis is by up-regulating the expression of MMPs and EMT-related molecules (27,28,36). Therefore, our study preliminarily revealed that MAGI1 acted as a tumorsuppressor to inhibit the metastasis progression through the suppression of ERK signaling pathway, which further repressed the expression of MMPs and impaired EMT progression.",

Moreover, we also discovered that MAGI1 acted as a key regulator in repressing cell migration and invasion through blocking MAPK/ERK signaling mediated MMP expression and EMT progression. However, further studies are required to clarify the specific mechanisms involved in this process. A more comprehensive understanding of the role of MAGI1 in GC metastasis may contribute to the development of novel drugs and expand new horizon for the investigation on GC in clinical therapy.",
