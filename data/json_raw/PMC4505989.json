            "text": "Background: Pediatric obesity is one of the predisposing risk factors for many non-communicable diseases. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to estimate the national prevalence of general and abdominal obesity among Iranian children and adolescents. Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional nationwide study was performed in 30 provinces in Iran among 14880 school students aged 6-18 years, selected by multistage random cluster sampling. The World Health Organization growth curve was used to categorize Body Mass Index (BMI). Obesity was defined as BMI equal to or higher than the age-and gender-specific 95 th percentile; abdominal obesity was considered as waist-to-height ratio of more than 0.5. Results: Data of 13486 out of 14880 invited students were complete (response rate of 90.6%). They consisted of 6543 girls and 75.6% urban residents, and had a mean age of 12.45 (95% CI: 12.40-12.51) years. The prevalence rate of general and abdominal obesity was 11.89% (13.58% of boys vs. 10.15% of girls) and 19.12% (20.41% of boys vs. 17.79% of girls), respectively. The highest frequency of obesity was found in the middle school students (13.87% general and 20.84% abdominal obesity). The highest prevalence of general obesity was found in Boushehr (19%) followed by Guilan and Mazandaran (18.3%, 18.3%), while the lowest prevalence was observed in Hormozgan (2.6%). The highest frequency of abdominal obesity was found in Mazandaran (30.2%), Ardabil (29.2%) and Tehran (27.9%). Provinces such as Sistan-Baloochestan (8.4%), Hormozagan (7.4%), and Kerman (11.4%) had the lowest prevalence of abdominal obesity. The Southern and South Eastern provinces had the lowest prevalence of general obesity (2.6% and 5.6%) and abdominal obesity (7.4% and 8.8%). Moreover, the highest prevalence of obesity was found in North and North West Iran by maximum frequency of 18.3% general obesity and 30.2% of abdominal obesity. Conclusions: The results showed a high prevalence of general and abdominal obesity among boys living in the Northern provinces of Iran. The present study provides insights that policy makers should consider action-oriented interventions for prevention and control of childhood obesity at national and sub-national level.",

It is estimated that by 2030 up to 57.8% of the world's adults would suffer from being overweight or obese (2). Along with adulthood obesity, childhood obesity has also emerged as an epidemic health problem in both developed and developing countries (3,4). Increase in population size and age and urbanization and a noticeable change in lifestyle had led to an elevated overweight and obesity, especially in developing countries (2). Iran, as a developing country, has been undergoing a rapid phase of urbanization and lifestyle changing especially vis-a-vis nutrition transition in the past few decades, contribut-ing to increasing prevalence of obesity (5,6). The problem of obesity has not only effected the adults' life, but the health condition of children. Childhood abdominal obesity would lead not to only obstructive sleep apnea with subsequent increase in the accumulation of carbon dioxide, but an increase in the prevalence of high blood pressure and fatty liver (7,8). Central obesity could serve as a leading cause of type 1 diabetes and higher levels of LDL-cholesterol (7,9,10). Moreover, it can be associated with a low bone mass especially among adolescents and increased risk of allergic diseases in childhood (11)(12)(13).",

Stratification was executed in each province according to the residence area (urban/rural) and school grade (elementary/intermediate/high school). The sampling was proportional to size with equal sex ratio, namely, a selection of boys and girls from each province in equal numbers, and the ratios in urban and rural areas corresponded to the population of students in those related sites. In this way, the number of samples in rural/urban areas and in each school grade was divided equally to the population of students in each grade. Cluster sampling with equal clusters was used in each province to scope the required sample size. Clusters concluded the level of schools, including 10 sample units (students and their parents) in each cluster. The maximum sample size that could provide a proper estimate of all risk factors of interest was selected resulting in the sample size of 480 students in each province. Therefore, a total of 48 clusters of 10 subjects in each of the provinces, and a total of 14,880 students were selected.",

Considerable variations were documented in the prevalence of obesity across the country, the highest prevalence of general obesity was found in Boushehr (19%) followed by Guilan and Mazandaran (18.3%, 18.3%), while the lowest prevalence was observed in Hormozgan (2.6%). The highest frequency of abdominal obesity was found in Mazandaran (30.2%), Ardabil (29.2%) and Tehran (27.9%). Provinces such as Hormozagan (7.4%), Sistan-Baloochestan (8.4%) and Kerman (11.4%), however, showed the lowest prevalence of central adiposity. Across the country, the Southern and South Eastern provinces had the low-est prevalence of general obesity (2.6% and 5.6%) and abdominal adiposity (7.4% and 8.8%). Moreover, the highest prevalence of obesity was found in North and North West of Iran by maximum frequency of 18.3% general obesity and 30.2% of abdominal adiposity (Figures 2 and 3).",

The obesity prevalence in a study conducted by Ziaoddini et al. (18) illustrated that about 3.5% of 6-year-old children were affected by obesity. In the current study, the prevalence of general and abdominal obesity was higher among boys (13.58% and 20.41%, respectively) than girls (10.15% and 17.79%, respectively). In the present study the prevalence of abdominal and general adiposity in three levels of education was 19.36% and 11.97%, respectively with higher frequency of abdominal and general obesity in middle school students. The first national study on the obesity prevalence has illustrated the higher frequency of general obesity among boys than girls (national cut offs: 2.4% vs. 2.39%; CDC: 2.5% vs. 2% and IOTF criteria: 1.6% vs. 1.3%) and the rate of general obesity in three levels of Primordial, middle and high school was 4.4%, 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively with the higher prevalence among Primordial school students (17).",

In this regard, Primordial care providers can help preventing the obesity-associated disorders through comprehensive assessment and management of weight disorders among children at national level. The latest national data from the Middle-East region revealed that the obesity is epidemic in several Middle Eastern countries such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Oman, Turkey, Bahrain and Jordan. Moreover, the results showed that the obesity-associated co-morbidities in these countries are growing as well (22). A report from the United States published in 2012 highlighted that the prevalence of obesity among 2 -19 year-old boys and girls was 18.6% and 15.0% respectively. In addition, the report also illustrated the dramatic increment in the obesity prevalence from 14.0% to 18.6% among boys, and from 13.8% to 15.0% among girls in 1999 -2000 and from 2000 to 2009 (23). Among Canadian adolescents aged 12 -19, the rate of central obesity increased from 1.8% to 12.8% during 1981 -2009 (24). Similarly a review study by de Moraes et al. (2011) demonstrated that more than 10% of 10 -19 yearold adolescents suffered from abdominal obesity with its highest prevalence rate among boys (25). Furthermore, findings of a recent systematic review and meta-analysis study among Iranian children and adolescents revealed a lower prevalence of obesity and a higher frequency of overweight among girls with a higher rate of excess body weight among children aged 2 to11 compared to their older counterparts (26). According to the above-mentioned studies, along with the growing prevalence of general and abdominal obesity among Iranian children and adolescents, the similar results have also been observed in other parts of the world in recent years such as the USA, Canada and Middle-Eastern countries (22)(23)(24).",
