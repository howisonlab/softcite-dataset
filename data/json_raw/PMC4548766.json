Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched by two independent researchers through to March 31, 2015 to identify relevant studies. All the extracted literature were managed by Bibliographic citation management software. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale judgment. The data were analyzed using RevMan5.2 software. Results: Eight studies including a total of 761 patients with HCC and hypersplenism (360 in the HS group, 401 in the H group) were finally included in the analysis. Outcomes, including postoperative complications, perioperative mortality, operation time, 5-year survival rate, and need for blood transfusion did not differ significantly between the two groups. HS was associated with significantly more intraoperative bleeding (mean difference [MD] 57.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 18.83-95.46, P=0.003), and CD4/CD8 ratio (MD 0.69, 95% CI 0.61-0.77,",

Hypersplenism results in pancytopenia, and hepatectomy in patients with hypersplenic correspondence: shi-Qiang shen Department of general surgery, renmin hospital of Wuhan University, hubei Zhang  thrombocytopenia may cause a perioperative bleeding episode and sometimes liver failure. 2 Therefore, many surgeons hesitate to perform hepatectomy for patients with HCC and hypersplenism. Splenectomy is perceived as a good management technique for hypersplenism, as it helps to improve thrombocytopenia and leukopenia and decrease pressure in the portal veins. 3,4 In addition, some studies suggest that splenectomy may help to improve liver function, [5][6][7] nutritional metabolism, 6 and Child-Pugh scores. 8 However, whether patients with HCC and hypersplenism should undergo hepatectomy and a concomitant splenectomy remains controversial. To address these issues and provide more references on the treatment of HCC complicated by hypersplenism, we conducted an integrated quantitative evaluation using metaanalysis to compare the efficacy and safety of simultaneous hepatectomy and splenectomy (HS) or hepatectomy (H) alone in patients with HCC and hypersplenism.",

            "text": "In recent years, the 5-year survival rate has been reported to reach 50%-70% in strictly selected patients undergoing liver resection, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation, or liver transplantation for the treatment of early HCC. 26 Under current medical conditions, hepatectomy is still the primary treatment for HCC. Splenectomy has been suggested for the treatment of secondary hypersplenism and thrombocytopenia. 27 Sugawara et al 28 recommended splenectomy as an aid to extend the patient selection criteria for hepatectomy to patients with HCC and hypersplenism. Hypersplenism can lead to decreased WBC and platelet counts, which can lower the body's resistance to infection and cause coagulopathy, which is traditionally considered as a contraindication to HS for patients with HCC and hypersplenism. However, some patients have good hepatic reserve, and improvements in preoperative preparation, surgical  techniques, and postoperative care can raise the ability to tolerate HS. Two-stage hepatectomy and splenectomy may lead to complications and inevitably prolongs the overall treatment time. Hepatectomy conducted after splenectomy when WBC and platelet counts return to normal may reduce the surgical risk, but may increase the risks of tumor recurrence and metastasis. Hepatectomy before splenectomy may result in uncontrolled intraoperative and postoperative oozing of blood from surgical wounds and lead to further severe liver damage, uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock, and multiple organ failure due to factors such as coagulation disorder and thrombocytopenia. Simultaneous splenectomy can increase postoperative WBC and platelet counts significantly, improve blood coagulation, and reduce the incidence of postoperative bleeding. Therefore, some researchers [17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] have considered HS to be beneficial for patients with HCC and hypersplenism. However, their studies have been retrospective in nature and have included limited numbers of cases. There has been no convincing evidence for the efficacy and safety of simultaneous HS for patients with HCC and hypersplenism. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HS versus H alone in patients with HCC and hypersplenism by comparing the short-term and long-term results between the two groups.",

            "text": "In addition to complications related to technical errors and perioperative evaluation, portal vein thrombosis and uncontrolled infection are known to be life-threatening complications after simultaneous HS. [29][30][31] The results of our meta-analysis indicate that there is no significant difference in terms of perioperative mortality between simultaneous HS and H alone for patients with HCC and hypersplenism, and HS does not increase the risk of postoperative complications. Overwhelming infection is a well-known and much feared complication after splenectomy. The incidence is low, with a higher death rate in children. The interval between splenectomy and first infection ranges from 15 to 49.7 months. Theoretically, liver cirrhosis is an immunocompromised condition, but overwhelming sepsis has rarely been reported after splenectomy for hypersplenism in cirrhotic patients in other studies. 32,33 No overwhelming post splenectomy infection was reported over a long follow-up period in patients who underwent simultaneous HS in any of the included studies. Portal vein thrombosis refers to the complete or partial obstruction of blood flow in the portal vein due to the presence of a thrombus in the vasal lumen, and is a severe complication after splenectomy. In our study, only one patient was identified to have portal vein thrombus, which resolved on conservative treatment. Hepatectomy also raises the portal vein pressure, which increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Splenectomy reduces the portal vein inflow by 20%-30%, consequently decreasing portal vein pressure 34 and reducing the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.",

            "text": "Acknowledging that the spleen normally plays a key role in preventing infection, the changes in immune function caused by splenectomy is another concern. The spleen in a patient with HCC and hypersplenism often shows negative immune function. In addition, research has shown that the spleen in a tumor-burdened host attracts a large number of inhibitory macrophages; these cells change the structure and function of the TCR-CD3 complex, thus inhibiting the immune function of T lymphocytes. 35 The cellular response plays a central role in anti-tumor immunity. CD4 T lymphocytes mainly produce cytokines to regulate anti-tumor immunity, and CD8 T lymphocyte cells produce immunosuppressive cytokines. So, to a certain extent, determination of T lymphocyte subsets could reflect the body's immune function. Th1 cells produce IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 and promote a cellular immune response, so play an important role in antitumor immunity, whereas Th2 cells mainly produce IL-4 and IL-10 and inhibit secretion of Th1 cells. Splenectomy may reduce destruction and storage of platelets and WBCs in the spleen, and at the same time reduce platelet-related antibody levels in serum and increase platelet production by increasing the release of thrombopoietin. The results of our meta-analysis showed that after simultaneous HS, postoperative WBC and platelet counts return to normal, and T lymphocyte subsets such as CD4 and CD4/CD8 and levels of Th1 lymphocyte cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 increased, but T lymphocyte subsets such as CD8 and Th2 lymphocyte cytokines such as IL-10 decreased. These variations indicate, to some extent, that simultaneous HS reduced the risk of perioperative bleeding, avoided immunosuppression of the spleen, and enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, it created favorable conditions for subsequent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and adjuvant chemotherapy, hopefully improving the prognosis for patients. 36 The results of our meta-analysis indicate more intraoperative blood loss with simultaneous HS than with H alone. However, operation time and need for blood transfusion did not differ significantly between the two surgical approaches. Patients with HCC and hypersplenism often have severe cirrhosis, and simultaneous HS increased the surgical trauma. Therefore, reasonable perioperative management, and careful operation are helpful to decrease perioperative bleeding and are the key to successful surgery and an uneventful postoperative recovery.",

An increase in WBC and platelet counts after splenectomy will be favorable for postoperative chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the 5-year survival rates for the two treatment groups were not significantly different in our study; however, we could only find two relevant studies for inclusion in our meta-analysis, so more studies are needed in this area. The two studies 19,24 we identified had reported that 5-year relapse-free survival was better in patients who underwent simultaneous HS than in those who underwent H alone; however, we could not compare the relapse-free survival rate between the HS and H groups because only one study provided the data needed to do so.",

(if yes, one star); 2. Was the subject representative of the total population? (one star, if truly or obviously; no stars if subjects were selected group or not described). Comparability: 3. Did the study show no differences between HS and H in patients with HCC and hypersplenism? Five main factors were considered: positive node of primary tumor, disease-free interval, number of liver metastases, presence of liver tumor, carcinoembryonic antigen level. Other four factors: age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy were comparative (if yes, two stars; one star if there were no other differences between the two groups even if one or more of these five characteristics was not reported; no star was assigned if the two groups differed). Outcome assessment: 5. Clearly defined outcome of interest (if yes, one star); 5. Adequacy of follow-up (one star if less than 20% of patients lost to follow-up, otherwise no stars).",
