            "text": "Chimerism is the presence in a host of genetically distinct cells that originated from another individual. 1 Its existence has clearly been demonstrated in multiple fields such as hematopoietic stem cell 2 or solid organ transplantation, 3 non-depleted blood transfusions 4 and the most common form which is bidirectional maternal-fetal cell trafficking whereby cells from the fetus pass through the placenta and establish durable cell lineages within the mother. By delving a little deeper into this last topic, one can notice that normal fetal development directly correlates with previous and concomitant growth of the placenta. Placental development starts with trophoblast differentiation from trophoectoderm, a key factor for implantation (which begins from the sixth day after fertilization). 5 Extravillous cytotrophoblastic cells literally invade the decidua basalis to form the fetal-maternal interface. Trophoblastic-derived cells enzymatically digest the maternal endometrium and even myometrium in a hypoxia to normoxia gradient, 5 leading to constrained bleeding that forms numerous blood-filled lacunae. Extravillous infiltrating trophoblasts actively remodel maternal spiral afferent arteries resulting in a significant increase of vessel diameter (up to 10-fold) and a reduction of blood flow pressure, in order to assure enough blood provision for ongoing fetal requirements. 6 Villous trophoblasts are responsible for chorionic villi formation, which augment the surface of contact allowing for an extensive and controlled nutrient and gas exchange between oxygen's high-avidity fetal erythrocytes and maternal blood in the intervillous space. Taking into account all the above-mentioned characteristics, it is reasonable to conclude that allogeneic cells are in very close contact during the fetal development process. Many of the immunological hypo-reactivity mechanisms orchestrated in part by trophoblast and its derived cells have been described elsewhere, 7,8 even though this tolerant state must live with a certain degree of inflammatory responses, thus enabling both blood flow increase and trophoblast invasion. The maintenance of this acquired tolerance in both the mother and the progeny has been studied, and persistent microchimerism is common 9 in the context of autoimmune diseases 10,11 and even in tissue regeneration. 12 Our previous experimental background on the use of different stem cell sources 13,14 has focused on studying immunological reactivity of newly implanted allogeneic cells used to regenerate cardiac damaged tissue. In order to graphically illustrate an early natural allogeneic contact that initiates the journey of a child's cells (in this case a son's cells) within the mother's blood and other tissues, we used a new procedure in microscopy imaging generating large scale panoramic pictures (LSPP). Unique aspects of the LSPP technique are that it provides high definition pictures covering large areas and permits a global contextualization of targeted zones or cells.",

Surprisingly, autofluorescence of extra-cellular matrix components within red and green channels helped in imaging global tissue structures without interfering with expected FISH probes fluorescence. As expected, the decidua contained maternal cells organized within the endometrial tissue (XX, nuclei showing *Correspondence to: Antoni Bayes-Genis; Email: abayesgenis@gmail.com Submitted: 10/10/11; Revised: 01/04/12; Accepted: 01/20/12 http://dx.doi.org/10.4161/chim.19439 two green dots) surrounded by fetal structures (cells containing one green \"X\" dot and one red \"Y\" dot within the same nucleus in Fig. 1B and C), suggesting a maternal micro-septum (Fig. 1B). It is also frequent to find in the placenta, fetal-derived structures infiltrating maternal tissues as shown with white arrows in Figure 1B, and even at the cell level as shown in Figure 1D and E. Figure 1F illustrates the presence of two distinct adjacent allogeneic cells from the mother and the baby at the fetal-maternal interface. After observing the exposed LSPP, it is reasonable to consider that fetal cells can easily be transferred and circulate within maternal blood either because cells can migrate from villi or simply due to infiltrating cells. The question of how immunogenic processes of alloresponse have been altered can consequently be addressed. In other words, a deeper understanding of this \"nonaggression pact\" at the fetal-maternal interface, in which two genetically distinct cell lineages coexist, may improve the options to mimic this procedure in transplantation, autoimmunity and regenerative medicine using allogeneic sources.",
