            "text": "Sarcopenia corresponds to the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength associated with ageing and leads to a progressive impairment of mobility and quality of life. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this process are not completely understood. A hallmark of cellular and tissular ageing is the accumulation of oxidatively modified (carbonylated) proteins, leading to a decreased quality of the cellular proteome that could directly impact on normal cellular functions. Although increased oxidative stress has been reported during skeletal muscle ageing, the oxidized protein targets, also referred as to the 'oxi-proteome' or 'carbonylome', have not been characterized yet. To better understand the mechanisms by which these damaged proteins build up and potentially affect muscle function, proteins targeted by these modifications have been identified in human rectus abdominis muscle obtained from young and old healthy donors using a bi-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomic approach coupled with immunodetection of carbonylated proteins. Among evidenced protein spots, 17 were found as increased carbonylated in biopsies from old donors comparing to young counterparts. These proteins are involved in key cellular functions such as cellular morphology and transport, muscle contraction and energy metabolism. Importantly, impairment of these pathways has been described in skeletal muscle during ageing. Functional decline of these proteins due to irreversible oxidation may therefore impact directly on the above-mentioned pathways, hence contributing to the generation of the sarcopenic phenotype.",

Although physiological concentrations of ROS can function as signaling molecules that regulate proliferation, growth, differentiation, and apoptosis [1], when ROS levels overcome the capacity of cellular antioxidant systems, they become toxic, introducing oxidative modifications on cellular macromolecules such as nucleic acids, lipids and, in particular, proteins, inflicting alterations to normal cellular functions. In skeletal muscle, oxidative stress state has negative consequences on action-potential conduction, excitation-contraction coupling, satellite cell differentiation, muscle contraction and mitochondrial respiration [2].",

Oxidative stress contribute at least in part to muscle atrophy [3][4][5][6], and previous studies have addressed the extent of protein oxidative damage in the development of sarcopenia in mammalian models [7][8][9][10]. Although it is believed that oxidative stress contributes to skeletal muscle dysfunction Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/redox through macromolecular damage, the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Protein post-translational modifications induced by ROS are important features of oxidative stress [11]. Among them, protein carbonyl content is by far the most commonly used marker of protein oxidation [12,13]. In fact, protein carbonylation occurs when proteins directly react with ROS, leading to the formation carbonyl groups (aldehydes and ketones) for instance on such amino acids side chains as arginine, lysine, threonine and proline. Introduction of carbonyl groups on proteins can also occur through the reaction of aldehydic products of lipid peroxidation and of dicarbonyl compounds upon glycation and glycoxidation. Since it often leads to a loss of protein function and an increased thermosensitivity or hydrophobicity of the targeted protein [14,15], protein carbonylation has been considered as an indicator of protein damage.",

In fact, proteomics and in particular bi-dimensional (2D) gels represent appropriate tools for the detection and identification of specific carbonylated proteins in a complex mixture [2,13,20]. The identification of such oxidatively modified proteins (i.e. the oxi-proteome components), can give some insights into the mechanisms by which these damaged proteins accumulate and potentially affect cellular and/or tissular function during ageing or in disease conditions [21]. In this paper, the occurrence and characterization of carbonylated proteins was studied in human rectus abdominis muscle obtained from young and old healthy donors. Although no significant differences in global protein carbonylation was observed at the proteome level, we have used 2D gel electrophoresis based proteomic approaches to improve the resolution of individual proteins for the quantitative analysis of their carbonylation status and further identification of these major skeletal muscle proteins that are targeted by oxidative damage during human rectus abdominis skeletal muscle ageing.",

No significant differences at the global level in protein carbonyl content was detected between groups, in agreement with what was previously reported by Marzani et al. who did not find a statistical difference on protein carbonyl content during ageing in both rectus abdominis and vastus lateralis human muscles [18]. More recently, Fan\u00f2 et al., using skeletal muscle biopsy samples obtained from vastus lateralis, found that protein carbonyls, showed a significant increase during ageing. However, this difference was not significant after splitting by gender [27]. Importantly, immunodetection of carbonylated proteins after one-dimensional (1D) electrophoresis separation has serious limitations for the resolution of single protein bands and can provide only restricted information.",

After electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes total protein profiles were obtained by fast-green staining (Fig. 2). All the analyzed samples displayed a similar protein migration pattern, suggesting no drastic shifts in the protein profiles at the expression level (Fig. 2, right panels) between the two experimental groups. Immunodetection of carbonylated proteins was performed after their derivatization by DNPH as described in Material and methods. Interestingly, the pattern of the modified proteins was not superimposable with the pattern obtained for the total protein staining, indicating that certain proteins represent preferential targets for these deleterious oxidative modifications.

            "text": "The identified skeletal muscle proteins were then analyzed and grouped by metabolic pathways and cellular functions. Major biological functions include muscle contraction, energy transduction and energy metabolism (Fig. 4). Among proteins involved in muscle contraction, we have found that myosin 7, troponin T, myosin-binding protein C (MyBPC), and LIM domain-binding protein 3 (ZASP) are increasingly carbonylated in aged muscle. Interestingly, the decreased speed of contraction observed in old age at both the muscle and motor protein levels is a hallmark of skeletal muscle ageing [28][29][30][31]. Myosin is a highly conserved protein that converts chemical energy into mechanical force and a key protein for muscle contraction. Previous studies have shown increased glycation of myosin in both fiber types of aged rats [32]. In addition, the carbonylated residues have been identified [33]. Interactions of myosin with cytoskeletal proteins such as titin, myomesin/M protein and MyBPC play an important role in thick filaments physiology. MyBPC contributes to the assembly and stabilization of thick filaments and modulates the formation of actomyosin cross-bridges, via direct interactions with both thick myosin and thin actin filaments [34,35]. The importance of MyBPC to muscle contraction is further emphasized by the discovery that mutations in genes encoding MyBPC cause myopathies in both skeletal [36,37] and cardiac muscles [38][39][40]. Increased oxidation of MyBPC, together with the previously reported age-dependent decrease of myosin isoforms and regulatory proteins like myosin binding proteins C and H [41][42][43][44], may contribute to the destabilization of muscle fibers. In addition, perturbations in the thin sarcomere fillaments of muscle fibers have also been associated with differently expression of actin and its regulatory proteins such as troponin and tropomyosin [42,43,45,46]. Here we found increased carbonylation levels of troponin T in the elderly. Troponin inhibits the actomyosin Mg 2 \u00fe -ATPase and the Ca 2 \u00fe release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum inducing a change in the troponin-tropomyosin conformation that exposes myosin binding sites on the actin filament and activates the myosin ATPase, thereby allowing muscle contraction [47,48]. Since muscle contraction depends on myofibrillar thin filament interactions [49], the oxidative damage to these proteins may well compromise this interaction and hence muscle contraction.",

The renewal of ATP is achieved mainly by the phosphocreatine-creatine kinase (PCr-CK) system. Among the creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes, the muscle-type CK (MM-CK) specifically binds to the myofibril M-line and is associated with the action-activated myosin ATPase as an intramyofibrillar ATP regenerator [50][51][52]. Since this MM-CK was found irreversibly oxidized in old rectus abdominis muscle, this could alter muscle metabolism and compromise muscle contraction in the elderly. Besides the PCr-CK system, the glycolytic network and its closer interaction between mitochondria and organelles also provide energy within muscle cells [53]. In this study, 3 glycolytic enzymes appear as highly carbonylated in old slow oxidative skeletal rectus abdominis muscle: the fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A, the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1) and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) ( Table 2). Interestingly, several of these enzymes involved in anaerobic metabolism have been found decreased with age in murine and human skeletal muscle [54,55].",

For this reason, muscle metabolism and contraction in aged skeletal muscle would be affected by irreversible carbonylation on glycolytic proteins, as previously reported in certain diseases when these glycolytic enzymes are not functional [57][58][59][60][61][62]. Defects in the muscle form of glycogen phosphorylase, another protein found increased carbonylated in old rectus abdominis muscle, are involved in type 5 glycogen storage disease, also known as McArdle disease, a myopathy also characterized by exercise intolerance, such as easy fatigability, muscle cramps and contractures as well as muscle weakness [63,64]. Intramuscular glycogen acts as a readily available source of glucose-6-phosphate for glycolysis within skeletal muscle and glycogen phosphorylase catalyses the rate-limiting step in glycogenolysis [65]. Therefore, a deficiency in glycogen phosphorylase may result in the inability to mobilize muscle glycogen during anaerobic metabolism [66].",

Our results suggest that oxidative stress during skeletal muscle ageing targets the contractile machinery, but also structural and regulatory proteins. In addition, the main mechanism of energy production, the phosphocreatine kinase system was affected by carbonylation in the elderly while other energetic metabolic pathways such as glycolysis appear to be also affected. Finally, the heat shock 70 kDa protein (HSP70), a key player in protein quality control with different identified roles in skeletal muscle [67], such as protection against oxidative stress, was also found highly carbonylated in old skeletal muscle. Up-regulation of heat shock proteins is a well know feature of muscle ageing [46,68,69]. Further studies should address the functional status of the identified carbonylated proteins and related cellular pathways associated with muscle dysfunction in order to reveal their role in the development of the ageing phenotype.
