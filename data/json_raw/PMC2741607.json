Finally, 232 cervical samples from 135 women with previous cytological abnormalities were included in this study. Colposcopy studies and biopsies were performed. Haematoxylin-eosin stained slides were observed and detection of HPV DNA in cervical swabs was carried out with use of a polymerase chain reaction and microarrays technology. The relationship between the presence of HPV infection and diagnostic variables was evaluated. HPV 16 was the most common type followed by HPV 58, 51, 33 and 31. However, the two HPV types targeted in the prophylactic vaccines such as HPV type 16 and 18 were detected in only 37 (21.2%) and 2 (1.1%) cases respectively. Thirty-three (18.9%) of samples were infected with multiple types, the majority of them with two types. In addition, during the follow-up of patients many changes in type distribution were observed. Several studies will be necessary in order to evaluate the HPV type distribution for therapeutically and prophylactic purposes such as vaccine treatment. Also, because of the differences obtained depending of use of various DNA technologies, the performance of some comparative studies of the different methods from detection of HPV would be advisable in a high population of patients and with the most homogeneous conditions possible."

Firstly, HPV was recognized as the cause of cutaneous warts, although this infection is also related to focal epithelial hyperplasia of the oral cavity (Heck's disease), epidermodysplasia verruciformis, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and conjunctival papillomas and carcinomas [4]. Moreover, several epidemiological studies permit to conclude that certain HPV type infections are a necessary factor for the development to cervical cancer [5][6][7]. These kind of neoplasias represent the second most common cancer in women worldwide and contribute with approximately 10% of overall female cancers. Other tumours HPV-related are anal, vaginal, vulvar, penile, laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancer, so HPV is estimated responsible to 5% of all kind of neoplasias worldwide [8]. In fact, in 1990 was described the presence of HPV type 16 in laryngeal carcinomas [9].",

The population came from a health area of approximately 450,000 inhabitants corresponding to the North of the province of Granada (Andaluc\u00eda, Spain). From these, 250,000 are eligible women for participation in the ECCDP, but only 1,500 women were send from the health basic centres to the CCDU of our Hospital to complete the study. Finally, 232 samples for HPV typing and 173 biopsies corresponding to 135 women were included in this report. The main inclusion criterion was the presence of cytological alterations in the Pap smears and further remission to our hospital in order to complete the study. The only exclusion criteria were women who refusing to continue in follow up. The follow-up visits were established each 6 months during 3 years. The collected data were the patient age, HPV types and biopsy sample diagnosis. This histological diagnosis was classified in five categories as follows: inflammatory/reactive lesions, undetermined/not conclusive lesions such as atypia borderline, LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), HSIL (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), and invasive carcinoma."

Until now, the hybrid capture method (Digene \u00ae HPV test) is the only FDA  approved test to screen for the presence or absence of high/low-risk oncogenic HPV types [21]. However, several other technologies are being used for this purpose such as the in situ hybridization [22], polymerase chain reaction [23], real-time PCR [14] and new array methods [13]. It is apparent that there are substantial differences with respect to the sensitivity of the different diagnostic methods that should be assessed. In general in our study, the concordance with respect to the results obtained from both institutions was high, but some differences could be observed; real-time PCR (Roche) seems more sensitive than array method (Genomica). For example, in one case in which we did not found DNA, the use of a real-time PCR method in this sample led to obtain a positive result (three HPV types). For this reason, we believe that the performance of some comparative studies of the different methods from detection of HPV would be advisable in a high population of patients and with the most homogeneous conditions possible.",

Firstly, a higher percentage of infection with multiple types was obtained (33 samples/18.9%) with respect to other Spanish studies [10,17], and the majority of them were caused with two HPV types. In the majority of articles HPV types 16, 18, 31 were the most common HPV types obtained [3,15,17]. However, in our study HPV type 18 only was obtained in two samples (1.1%). These data are agreeing with other published studies in Spain [17,18], in which HPV type 18 does not appear as a common type in the general population in our country. Secondly, HPV type 16 was the most common type in all studies, but there was some differences with respect to the prevalence to the other HPV types. In our study, the prevalence of HPV type 16 was lower than those described in the medical literature (about 50%) [15]. HPV type 16 and 18 are the two main target of both vaccines, so the address of prevalence of these types is important. In the majority of studies, HPV 16 and 18 cause 70-80% of lesions [3,15,17]; however, in our study the prevalence of both types taken together was 22.3%. This fact is highlighted for the introduction of vaccines in a precise population. From an epidemiological point of view, the performance of these kind of works in a local level is important, because it is necessary to know the different epidemiological patterns to apply the correct diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutically measures in each area.",

In our opinion, this fact could be due to several reasons: the presence of high variability in harvesting samples (no clearly visible or established lesions, endocervical location, suboptimal collection of samples), the different sensitivity and specificity of our diagnosis method ( Table 2) with respect to other methods, the biological characteristics of the viruses and finally the variability in the interpretation of the histological features and absence of reliable criteria. This feature is an important issue because the histological diagnosis in cervical pathology is the \"gold standard\". The absence of complete reliability is a common problem in all kinds of biopsies come from different organs and tissues, above all in low-grade neoplastic lesions. Moreover, in spite of this inconvenient, microscopic evaluation of cervical biopsies has a high level of accuracy done by expert pathologists. Thus, the absence of concordance between HPV typing and the histological diagnosis means that HPV could be present in cervical epithelial cells without produce atypical changes or minimal cellular alterations identified by means of cytology. In fact, in our study 48 of 67 (71.6%) samples with reactive conditions were positive for HPV infection, although 9 of 14 (64.2%), 64 of 68 (94.1%) and 24 of 24 (100%) were also positive for HPV DNA and were diagnosed of atypia borderline, LSIL and HSIL respectively. In addition, another relevant aspect is the presence of 26 of 52 (50%) cases with HPV infection in patients without changes in colposcopic examination (no biopsies were taken by the gynaecologist).",

Epidemiologic studies clearly demonstrated that infection with HPV high-risk types is essential for the development of cervical cancer [24]. At the moment, the only two prophylactic vaccines available for clinical use are generated by recombinant technologies and are composed of viral-like particles. Cervarix produced by GlaxoSmithKline is a bivalent vaccine (HPV 16-18), while Gardasil produced by Merck is a quadrivalent vaccine (HPV 6-11-16-18). Until now, little is known about their comparative efficacy, safety and duration of protection. These data will be available in the future when these vaccines be widely worldwide applied.",

            "text": "However, after the analysis of the different epidemiological published studies, it can see that the epidemiological patterns of HPV types prevalence could be different depending of the region of origin. In many countries, these vaccines could prevent 50% of all HPV infections in women without cytological alterations [3], but also 70-80% of HPV infections caused in high-risk lesions or invasive carcinoma [15]. In our area, and taking into account the data shown in this paper, only approximately 30% of HPV infections that led to precursor neoplastic cervical lesions could be favoured with the introduction of the recently approved vaccines. In addition, it is necessary to study the prevalence of HPV types related to cervical carcinoma because we do not know the prevalence of HPV types that cause invasive carcinoma in our geographic area (the types that cause invasive cancer have a different distribution with respect those causing preneoplastic lesions) [15]. Thus, assessment of the distribution of HPV types in each health area will be a very important factor to indicate the vaccines. They imply that more epidemiological studies are necessary to know the HPV type prevalence in each area and regional variation in the distribution of certain HPV types should be taken into account in the future production of vaccines.",

            "text": "Regional variations in prevalence and distribution of HPV types have been demonstrated in several epidemiological studies. In some countries such as Spain, these changes could also be due to the increase of migrant women from Latin America [19], Eastern Europe [25] and North Africa [26] countries, so health service providers must establish continuous localized screening programs in order to identify the HPV infections. Moreover, apart of the change of the HPV types distribution pattern, an increase of the multiple infections can be observed. In our study, a higher percentage of infection with multiple types was obtained (33 samples/18.9%) with respect to other Spanish studies [10,17]. Also, in this study, the prevalence of HPV type 16 was lower than those described in the medical literature (about 50%) [15]. In the majority of women included in our study, HPV infections (high and low-risk types) disappeared promptly in the follow-up (6-12 months) and there was low correlation between the histological lesions and the HPV DNA detection for cervical samples, so further studies are neccesaries to address this fact.",
