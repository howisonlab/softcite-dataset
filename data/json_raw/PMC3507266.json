Obesity is prevalent in persons with HF and is also a likely contributor to cognitive function, as it has been independently linked to cognitive impairment in healthy individuals. The current study examined the association between obesity and cognitive performance among older adults with HF and whether obesity interacts with cerebral hypoperfusion to exacerbate cognitive impairment. Methods: Patients with HF (n = 99, 67.46 8 11.36 years of age) completed neuropsychological testing and impedance cardiography. Cerebral blood flow velocity (CBF-V) measured by transcranial Doppler sonography quantified cerebral perfusion and body mass index (BMI) operationalized obesity. Results: A hierarchical regression analysis showed that lower CBF-V was associated with reduced performance on tests of attention/executive function and memory. Elevated BMI was independently associated with reduced attention/executive function and language test performance. Notably, a significant interaction between CBF-V and BMI indicated that a combination of hypoperfusion and",

HF is also the most common reason for recurrent hospitalizations [2] and carries elevated risk of morality [3] , reduced functional independence [4] , and poor quality of life [5] . HF also increases risk for cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, and neuropathological insult [6][7][8] . Milder deficits in attention, executive function, memory, and language are also common and can be found in up to 75% of HF patients [9,10] . Although the mechanisms for cognitive impairment in HF are unclear, it is plausible that it stems from cerebral dysfunction predicated on deterioration of vascular health that causes cerebral hypoperfusion and subsequent ischemia [11] . Extant evidence also indicates that among HF patients, common vascular risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, depression, and obesity [12][13][14] , may exacerbate cognitive dysfunction.",

Participants were recruited from primary cardiology practices at Summa Health System in Akron, Ohio, and reflect the HF population receiving treatment at that facility. The inclusion criteria were age of 50-85 years, English as a primary language, and a diagnosis of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III at the time of enrollment. NYHA was confirmed by a medical record review. Potential participants were excluded for history of significant neurological disorder (e.g. dementia, stroke, multiple sclerosis, etc.), head injury with 1 10 min loss of con-sciousness, severe psychiatric disorder (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), past or current substance abuse/dependence, and renal failure.

The insonated arteries included the middle cerebral artery (MCA), the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), posterior cerebellar artery (PCA), intracranial vertebral arteries, basilar artery, terminal internal carotid artery, intracranial internal carotid artery, and ophthalmic artery. For each artery, the measurements provide several indices including mean flow velocity. As the index of global cerebral perfusion, we used the mean CBF-V in the ACA, MCA, and PCA. The CBF-V measures in each artery (i.e. ACA, MCA, and PCA) have high test-retest reliability (i.e. r = 0.90 to r = 0.95) [33] . HF Severity Cardiac output from a seated resting baseline estimated preservation of cardiac function. Impedance cardiography signals were recorded via a Hutcheson Impedance Cardiograph (Model HIC-3000, Bio-Impedance Technology, Chapel Hill, N.C., USA) using a tetrapolar band-electrode configuration. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded from the Hutcheson Impedance Cardiograph using disposable ECG electrodes. The basal thoracic impedance (Zo), the first derivative of the pulsatile impedance (dZ/dt) and the ECG waveforms were processed using specialized ensemble-averaging software (COP, BIT Inc., Chapel Hill, N.C., USA), which was used to derive stroke volume using the Kubicek equation. Following instrumentation, Impedance cardiographic signals were recorded for seven 40-second periods during a 10-min resting baseline. Finally, all cardiac output measurements were divided by body surface area, yielding cardiac index ( table 1 ).",

For all analyses, demographic and medical variables including age, gender, education, cardiac index, systolic and diastolic BP, and diagnostic history of diabetes, myocardial infarction, and depression were entered into the first block of the model. Medical history covariates were included in the model to account for the variance of common cardiovascular disease factors associated with obesity that influence cognitive function. BMI entered into the second block of the model and global CBF-V entered in the third block. Lastly, an interaction term consisting of the cross product of BMI and global CBF-V entered in the final block. Partial correlation analysis adjusting for medical and demographic characteristics was also conducted to clarify the association between BMI and global CBF-V. ",

Possible explanations include increased risk for vascular comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension [34,35] , or related vascular risk factors such as endothelial dysfunction, poor cardiovascular fitness, and systemic inflammation [36][37][38] , which are common in obese persons. Recent research also raises the possibility that circulating biomarkers, including \u2424 -amyloid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor [39,40] , might also influence neurocognitive outcomes in obese persons. These biomarkers are linked to cognitive performance in patient and healthy samples [41][42][43] .

In contrast, BMI was associated with performance on attention/executive function and a higher-order language measure but not on memory tasks. Notably, only attention/executive function evidenced a significant CBF-BMI interaction effect. Thus, attention/executive function appears to be vulnerable to both risk factors and to their combined influence. Such sensitivity may reflect the fact that prefrontal brain regions that mediate executive functions are particularly susceptible to adverse effects of ischemia and subsequent structural damage [49] . Similarly, both obesity and HF are associated with impairments on tests of attention and executive function [11,20,21] . In contrast, the literature regarding the effects of obesity on memory is inconsistent [21,50] .

First, the crosssectional design does not inform about the contribution of BMI or cerebral perfusion to cognitive outcomes over time. Similarly, although BMI is a practical and commonly used index of obesity, it is a coarse measure. Future studies employing more detailed assessments such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) may be beneficial through its ability to distinguish between fat and lean mass. More precise and detailed measures of cerebral perfusion (e.g. arterial spin labeling, positron emission tomography) may also provide details of regional variations in CBF that might not be detected using transcranial Doppler. Finally, future studies should also explore the influence of clinical comorbidities common to obese and HF patients (i.e. sleep apnea) on cognitive function, as such factors may also contribute to cerebral hypoperfusion and subsequent cognitive impairment in this population.",
