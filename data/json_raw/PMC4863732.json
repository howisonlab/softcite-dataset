The important potential confounding effect of dietary composition and intake used in many preclinical studies of cancer cachexia is frequently overlooked. Dietary designs applied in experimental studies should maximize the applicability to human cancer cachexia, meeting the essential requirements of the species used in the study, matched between treatment and control groups as well as also being generally similar to human consumption. Methods A literature review of scientific studies using animal models of cancer and cancer cachexia with dietary interventions was performed. Studies that investigated interventions using lipid sources were selected as the focus of discussion. Results The search revealed a number of nutrient intervention studies (n = 44), with the majority including n-3 fatty acids (n = 16), mainly eicosapentaenoic acid and/or docosahexaenoic acid. A review of the literature revealed that the majority of studies do not provide information about dietary design; food intake or pair-feeding is rarely reported. Further, there is a lack of standardization in dietary design, content, source, and overall composition in animal models of cancer cachexia. A model is proposed with the intent of guiding dietary design in preclinical studies to enable comparisons of dietary treatments within the same study, translation across different study designs, as well as application to human nutrient intakes. Conclusion The potential for experimental endpoints to be affected by variations in food intake, macronutrient content, and diet composition is likely. Diet content and composition should be reported, and food intake assessed. Minimum standards for diet definition in cachexia studies would improve reproducibility of pre-clinical studies and aid the interpretation and translation of results to humans with cancer.",

            "text": "Cancer cachexia is a wasting syndrome characterized by ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that leads to progressive functional impairment. 1 A global feature of cachexia is negative protein and energy balance driven by a variable combination of reduced food intake and abnormal metabolism. Experimental models are used extensively to study mechanisms underlying cachexia and to identify potential treatments. Preclinical studies enable control of many factors such as genetics, age, tumour type, and load that would be expected to influence the results of an intervention in a human population. Paradoxically, the important potential confounding effect of dietary intake and composition used in many pre-clinical studies of cancer cachexia is frequently overlooked. Where details of dietary intake in animal experiments of cancer cachexia have been included, the majority of animal diets are imbalanced or lack certain essential nutrients, and frequently bear no resemblance to those normally consumed by humans with respect to macronutrient and micronutrient levels. 2 Where nutrient interventions have been used for cancer cachexia studies, there is wide variation in timing and duration of supplementation, as well as route and frequency of administration of any given nutrient, making it difficult to compare results across different animal models, study designs, and laboratory groups. Key metabolic differences between rodents and humans are not widely appreciated. Moreover the importance of background diet is often ignored. Thus, animals fed nutrient-deficient diets may be particularly sensitive to nutritional stress induced by the cancer-bearing state, and demonstrate corresponding exaggerated beneficial responses to supplements containing the missing nutrients. Finally it can be argued that, to maximize the applicability to human cachexia, attention should be paid to making the composition of diets used for experimental animals both sufficient for essential baseline requirements for the species under study but also generally similar to human diets.",

            "text": "In humans, the mechanisms underlying cancer cachexia are complex, heterogeneous, and largely poorly defined. This complexity cannot be fully reproduced in animal models of cachexia, despite attempts to try and bridge the gap between human disease and animal models of cancer. A limited number of tumour cell types are used in rodent experiments [Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC); Colon 26 adenocarcinoma (C26)] but these are often chosen to be representative of tumourtypes (i.e. lung and colorectal cancers) which are more frequently associated with cachexia in humans. Tumour cell lines are typically implanted subcutaneously into experimental animal models, and are left to grow until the tumourburden induces cachexia symptoms. 3 Although tumour cell implantation induces cachexia, these tumours rarely metastasize, a key difference from cachexia-causing neoplasms in humans. 3 A variety of cachexia models are available, and methodological variations within models also make study comparisons difficult. 4 The majority of animal models for cancer and cancer cachexia use mice and each strain may have important differences relevant to their metabolic responses to cancer. Thus, some strains of in-bred animals are more susceptible to developing obesity and diabetes such as the C57BL/6J strain, 5 which can significantly affect study outcomes in cachexia. Furthermore, sex differences in growth responses are recognized in rodents, which may also limit generalizability of results to humans. Female rodents are preferred over male rodents in studies with endpoints involving body weight changes since females have a slower growth curve and are less susceptible to rapid changes in body weight. In contrast, studies attempting to limit hormonal fluctuations within an animal prefer male rodents. 6 In addition to metabolic and growth differences between sexes and strains of rodents, it is important to remember that there are also several important differences between human and rodent metabolism. Young and healthy rodents are commonly utilized in experimental studies; however young, healthy animals may not accurately reflect the manifestation of disease in adult or aging humans. For example, cancer patients may present with a number of comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and are typically over the age of 50 years old. 7 Furthermore, the progression and timeline of aging in humans are not equivalent to that in rodents. Quinn (2005) determined that the ratio of rat to human life span is 1 to 30, making the age of the host species an important factor to consider in the study design. 8 Moreover, rats reach mature skeletal size much earlier than humans. 9 Rodents also differ from humans in several aspects of metabolism. For example, rats have a higher activity of liver enzymes involved in altering the chemical structure of fats 10 and liver CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism. 11 Compared to human hepatocytes, rat hepatocytes are much less susceptible to carcinogenic factors and mutagenicity. 12 Absence of a gall bladder in rats enables certain fats to be secreted directly into the intestine; 13 thus, rats have an increased ability to eliminate cholesterol from the body. Unlike humans, rats are capable of liver vitamin C synthesis de novo, 14 resulting in 2.5-fold higher levels of vitamin C in their bodies compared to humans. 15 Rats also have a higher metabolic rate than other mammals and indeterminant growth, thus have a higher demand for energy relative to their small body size compared to human requirements. 16 In spite of all this, the similarities between rodents and humans are still sufficient to justify use of rodents as models of human disease, 8 but attention in design and interpretation of each experiment is required.",

Typical outcomes in cachexia studies include muscle mass and weight loss, both of which are intimately related to food intake. Regardless of the diet control, food intake is an essential measure particularly when nutrient intakes are associated with study outcomes.

            "text": "From the body of literature reviewed, it is clear that the majority of diets used are standard laboratory chow from commercial sources provided ab libitum (free access). Two of the most common laboratory rodent chows are the Standard Rat and Mouse Breeding Diet from Pilsbury (Birmingham, UK) and Panlab Laboratory Chow (Barcelona, Spain). Laboratory chow does not have a standard macronutrient composition, and is formulated from plant materials, meat meal, fishmeal, and fats that are rarely defined. 21 Standard laboratory chow diets vary from batch to batch, and individual ingredients may also vary over time. 22,23 Chows with closed formulas are incompletely characterized, making it nearly impossible to determine exactly what is in a particular batch. 21 These factors make it difficult to report the composition of lab chow, aside from the manufacturers name, since a batch fed five years ago will be different from a batch fed one year ago making results from individual studies difficult to replicate in future studies. Laboratory chow aims to meet the essential requirements for a rodent, but is delivered pre-mixed, making it difficult to modify. 21 Most laboratory chows provide the minimum requirement for essential fatty acids for rodents, usually 1.5% total diet, 24,25 and the primary source of fat in standard laboratory chow diet is most often corn oil. 26 Laboratory chow diets also contain micronutrients or compounds that are unknown to researchers and may impact study endpoints and results. For example, many commonly used natural-ingredient laboratory chows use soy as a protein source, inadvertently adding phytoestrogens to the diet in the form of isoflavones. 27 A number of studies have investigated the effects of using laboratory chow in animal models of breast cancer and endocrine/hormonal organ systems 28,29 have determined that the variability in commercial rodent chow diets interferes with the value of these animal models and experimental results. 27 The variation in isoflavone content between formulations of rodent chow and between batches of the same formulation has been shown to be several fold different. 27 A number of studies have also found chemicals present in rodent chow such as arsenic, 30 mercury, 31 and polychlorinated dioxins, 32 with these chemicals having the potential to exert effects on gene expression and phenotypic outcomes. Chow diets may significantly alter effects of experimental treatments, and in particular, affect gene and protein expression.",

The AIN first developed these diets to reduce the variance when researchers developed their own formulations. Results from studies prior to AIN-developed diets were difficult to compare across studies and nutrition disciplines. The original AIN diet was the AIN-76A formulation, which was later revised and replaced by AIN-93. 33 AIN-93 diets are offered in Growth (G) or Maintenance (M) forms, depending on the age of the animals being fed. AIN semi-purified diets are available without macronutrients and micronutrients, which enables researchers to formulate and alter the diet according to the particular study objectives. As opposed to corn oil, which was used in AIN diets prior to 1993, soybean oil has been used since 1993 which, compared to corn oil, has a more balanced fatty acid composition [15% saturated fat, 54% linoleic acid (n-6 fatty acid), 8% alpha linoleic acid (n-3 fatty acid), 23% oleic acid (n-9 fatty acid)].

When diet modifications occur in nutrient interventions, semi-purified diets provide a benefit over laboratory chow; if the nutrient intervention involves a modification of the fat source, semi-purified diets enable fats to be added and modified by the researcher. For example, corn oil can be substituted for olive oil, safflower oil, fish oil, or individual fatty acids of interest to determine effects of fatty acids or to enable matching of fatty acid composition between experimental groups. Furthermore, semi-purified diets allow researchers to modify fat quantity, and the proportion each type of fat contributes to the diet as a whole.",

Although studies may define dietary compositions in detail, fundamental matching of calories and nitrogen content between diets is often overlooked [34][35][36]  (Table 1).

Mice were randomized into diet groups containing 11.5% total energy from fat (source and composition unspecified by Beck and Tisdale, 1989 46 and Hudson and Tisdale, 1994; 41 palm oil used in control diet in by Tisdale, Brennan and Fearon, 1987 47 ). All three studies modified the control diet to consist of 80% of total energy from medium-chain triglycerides, and Hudson et al. 41 included a second treatment diet group, which consisted of 80% total energy from EPA ethyl esters. The proportions of fat in the diets within the same study are not similar to each other, nor are they congruent with human intakes. In another study, male Wistar rats bearing the Yoshida AH-130 ascites hepatoma, animals were randomized to receive resveratrol injections, or saline injections while consuming standard laboratory chow. 49 The diet consisted of 71% total kcal carbohydrates, 22% total kcal protein, and 7% total kcal fat. In contrast to the very high contribution of fat to the diets in Beck et al., 46 Hudson et al., 41 and Tisdale et al., 47 the macronutrient proportion of this diet compared to a typical human diet would be considered low in fat. Thus, results are difficult to extrapolate to humans, since the macronutrient imbalance results in either a high fat/low carbohydrate diets or low fat/high carbohydrate diets. These examples represent the majority of typical animal dietary designs in the preclinical cachexia literature, where the first criteria of matching kilocalories between diets are not met.",

            "text": "The following discussion will aim to provide a framework focused on fat content and composition of experimental diets. The principles and underlying considerations applied to fat as a macronutrient can also be applied to protein and carbohydrate quantity and composition. Fat content and composition are important to consider, especially in studies focused on 'tumour \u00d7 host \u00d7 nutrient' interactions. As a recommendation, it is important for fats included in the diet to first meet the nutrient requirements for the species being used, and second, for the composition and types of fat in the diet to be matched between diet treatments, and finally to represent what is commonly consumed by humans ( Figure 2). Most laboratory chow diets use corn oil as the only source of fat, 50 while fat blends that include more than one type of oil or fat source are used only in semipurified or nutritionally made diets. 21 A corn oil-based diet will result in a higher proportion of n-6 fatty acids and n-6/ n-3 fatty acid ratio than other oil types. In Wistar rats bearing the Walker 256 tumour, rats were fed high-fat diets (49% total kcals), low-fat diets (9% total kcals), or diets with fish oil and sunflower oil with varied ratios of n-6/n-3, 6:1; 30:1; and 60:1 (Table 1). 39,40 Pizato et al. 39,40 aimed to demonstrate that a lower n-6/n-3 ratio (6:1) was more effective in preventing cachexia compared to higher n-6/n-3 ratio diets; however the diets were not matched for calories. Higher ratios of n-6/n-3 fatty acids have been associated with greater inflammation and enhanced tumour growth, 51,52 emphasizing the importance of considering the n-6/n-3 ratio in dietary design. In addition to metabolic differences between n-6 and n-3 fatty acids, the length of fatty acid chains also has an impact on metabolism and energy expenditure. Compared to long chain fatty acids, medium chain fatty acids are absorbed more efficiently and have been associated with weight loss or reduced weight gain in long-term studies. Thus, fatty acid chain length is an additional factor to consider in dietary design given the differences in metabolism between long and medium chain fatty acids. 53 A number of studies to date have reported that promotion of mammary tumours in rodents fed a high-fat diet, compared with those fed a lowfat diet, may be due to specific metabolic activities of the type of fatty acids in the diet, independent of calories. 54 These findings reiterate the importance of designing macronutrient intakes to be representative of the research question at hand, and to further take into account the composition of the macronutrient class in addition to matching diets for kilocalories.",

The majority of studies that provide high-fat diets used sources of fat, with or without another nutrient, added to a background diet of standard laboratory chow. 37,43 These results should be interpreted cautiously since the capacity for chow diets to be modified is limited, and adding nutrients into the diet may reduce concentrations of the other nutrients. 23 This can result in a diet that is deficient for example, in protein per gram of chow. When animals are fed ad libitum, they will consume to a specific number of calories per day, therefore a high-fat diet, which is more calorie dense per gram of diet, also affects protein intake. The addition of nutrients to standard chow also makes it difficult to compare to the original lab chow. The control group may be receiving adequate proportions of macro-and micronutrients, whereas the experimental group may be deficient in certain nutrients.",

The effectiveness of long-chain fatty acids EPA and DHA on enhancing drug antitumour activity has been demonstrated in several rodent models of cancer. 55 Interestingly, a comparison of studies has shown that the effectiveness of EPA and DHA for antineoplastic activities depends on the background diet, with effects greatest in studies where control diets contain fat sources of palm or corn oil, and subsequently low levels of total polyunsaturated fatty acids. 56,57 Control diets with fat sources from safflower or sunflower oil, and therefore higher levels of total PUFA, do not give the same results. 21,55,58 N-3 fatty acids may exert different biological effects depending on the background diet fat composition, n-6/n-3 ratio, and polyunsaturated/saturated fat ratio. 39,59,60 Collectively, studies suggest that amount of total PUFA in the diet may be an important factor in determining efficacy of EPA and DHA on cancer-related outcomes.

While it is appreciated the high degree of variability in dietary consumption patterns of cancer patients over the disease trajectory, 61 it is still possible and probably advisable to use diets which are at least approximately in line with typical human diet macronutrient composition to facilitate interpretation between studies as well as translation to human populations. Cremades et al. 44 aimed to investigate whether a diet formulated with a crayfish enzymatic extract enriched in essential amino acids and n-3 fatty acids would be effective for the treatment of cancer-associated cachexia by decreasing mortality, morbidity and lengthened survival. A semi-purified diet using the AIN-76A Vitamin and Mineral mixture was developed with a macronutrient distribution of: 79% total kcal carbohydrates, 15% total kcal protein, and 6% total kcal fat. The source of fat in this diet was solely from olive oil, being high in n-9 fatty acids, and relatively low in n-6 and saturated fat, with minimal n-3 fatty acids. Although the fatty acid profile was not given much consideration, Cremades et al. 44 carefully considered the nitrogen balance of the diet. Since crayfish enzymatic extract is mainly protein and contains all essential amino acids, the casein from the standard diet was removed and replaced by the enzyme for the crayfish diet to achieve isonitrogenous diets. While the dietary design from this study includes a source of high quality protein, it would be considered low in fat compared to typical human intakes that fall in the range of 20-35% total kcal from fat. 62 Moreover, a low fat diet is not ideal in an experiment with weight gain or maintenance as a study endpoint.",

Since the route of administration was gavage, the addition of fat kilocalories on top of the background diet of standard laboratory would result in diets being dissimilar between control and treatment groups. Feeding coconut oil (>90% saturated fat) on top of laboratory chow (rich in n-6 fatty acids) does not achieve a dietary intake resembling a human diet, which consists of approximately 10% saturated fat. Moreover, the authors do not provide any information about the background diet, proportion of macronutrients, kcals consumed, or food intake, so it is not possible to determine the amount of fat consumed in total or the intake of other macronutrients in respect to the fat, such as the n-6/n-3 ratio.

The composition of the background diet of standard laboratory chow was not defined, and food intake was not reported. While EPA was administered in a consistent dose, food intake may have been reduced during the study period, which would change other source of nutrients during the study period that are known to interfere with EPA effectiveness such as the ratio of n-3/n-6 fatty acids. Several other studies have administered EPA/DHA interventions intragastrically 43  (Table 1), or by bolus micropipette dose, 45,42 with only one of these studies administering the background diet in a controlled daily amount and reporting food intake 18  (Table 1). In addition to the amount of n-6 fatty acids, research also suggests that the absorption of long chain n-3 fatty acids may be improved through the meat, fish, and poultry factor or when consumed with monounsaturated fatty acids. [63][64][65] Chow diets are high in n-6 fatty acids, and unbalanced for n-6/n-3 ratio which may alter the absorption of EPA and/or DHA.

A higher intake of n-3 fatty acids, therefore, may reduce pro-inflammatory mediators. 66 On the basis of this hypothesis, Griffini et al. 67 fed Wag-rij rats bearing CC531 colon carcinoma cells (i) low fat diet (11% total kcal fat), (ii) n-6 PUFA diet (38% total kcal from fat as safflower oil), or (iii) n-3 PUFA diet (38% total kcal from fat as fish oil). The sole source of fat in the n-6 and n-3 fatty acid treatment diets was safflower oil and fish oil respectively. When evaluating this diet, one must first consider that n-6 and n-3 fatty acids are dietary essential nutrients. When providing fat sources with minimal amounts of either n-6 or n-3 fatty acids, there is a risk of essential fatty acid deficiency. Results could be attributed to the deficiency, since the effects of n-3 fatty acids are being interpreted against a diet containing only n-6 fatty acids as the PUFA source, and additionally, results may be exaggerated when comparing treatment and control groups. 50,56 Further, diets are not matched for calories, and food intake was not reported.",

All three studies used the same dietary design. Animals were fed a standard diet of laboratory chow, containing 50% total kcal from carbohydrates, 20% total kcal from protein, and 11.5% total kcal from fat (Pilsbury's, Birmingham, United Kingdom), or semi-purified treatment diets with varying amounts of medium-chain triglycerides or fish oil supplemented up to 80% total kcal supplied as medium-chain triglycerides or 50% total kcal supplied as fish oil ( Table 1). The authors indicate that the treatment diets were developed to be isonitrogenous and isocaloric by reducing the carbohydrate content and supplementing the remaining energy from the fish oil or medium-chain triglycerides. However, this is not possible given the macronutrient composition as fat provides 9 kcal/g, whereas carbohydrates provide 4 kcal/g. Similar to Cremades et al., 44 the standard diet in both studies conducted by Tisdale et al. 25,47 and Dagnelie et al. 24 was low in fat, which is not ideal when the study endpoints involve weight loss or gain. Moreover, the proportion of fat in the high fat and fish-oil diets aforementioned, 68-80% medium chain triglycerides and 50% fish oil respectively, are not proportions that are applicable to human dietary intakes where very few medium-chain triglycerides or fish oil lipids are consumed in the daily diet. Similar to Griffini et al. 67 feeding fish oil as the sole source of fat eliminates n-6 fatty acids from the diet and places animals at a risk for essential fatty acid deficiency. Both studies fed a high dose of fish oil, accounting for 50% of total energy in the absence of n-6 fatty acids. Rats had free access to food throughout the study period. Dagnelie et al. 24 did report that the fish oil group had significantly lower food intake compared to control animals, however, this could be related to caloric density of the diets.",

The review of the literature revealed that there was only one other fat supplementation study that included a pair-fed group. 48 Dumas et al. 38 aimed to prevent severe cachexia by limiting a decline in food intake, weight loss, and by reducing the inflammatory marker, TNF-alpha in Berlin-Druckrey IX rats inoculated with DHD/K12 colon tumour cells. Animals were randomized to the semi-purified control diet or fish oil supplemented diet with free access (Table 1). Diets were matched for calories and nitrogen content, differing only in fatty acid composition. Dietary composition was defined in g/kg diet: casein (220 g), sucrose (187 g), cellulose (20 g), DL-methionine (1.6 g), mineral mixture (40 g), vitamin mixture (without vitamin E; 10 g), corn starch (371.4 g), and lipids (150 g). A variety of lipid sources were used to match diets for fat amount and composition. The lipid mixture in the control diet was composed of 12% peanut oil and 3% canola oil; lipid mixture in the fish oil diet was 8% peanut oil, 2% canola oil, and 5% fish oil. Peanut oil and canola oil are high in oleic acid (n-9 fatty acids) and linoleic acid (n-6 fatty acids), while peanut oil is also a major source of saturated fat. The main difference in composition of these diets is the EPA and DHA in the treatment diet, allowing researchers to attribute differences in the outcomes to the treatments. The lipid profile and major macronutrient proportions of the control diet are within the range of human dietary intakes, within a range of fish oil intake that would be achievable in humans, rendering these results applicable to human populations. Macronutrient proportions that are representative of typical human intakes, though rare in preclinical studies, remain advantageous in enabling translation of findings to human populations.",

            "text": "There is a lack of standardization in dietary design, content, source, and overall composition in animal studies of cancer cachexia. In many cases, information about the diet is not included. Standard lab chow may be easy and convenient to use, but the uncertainty about diet content when using a closed label diet is poorly appreciated. Knowledge that different groups of animals within the same experimental study are consuming diets divergent in nutrient content may be critical to fully interpret the effectiveness of a given intervention. Many studies using preclinical models frequently fail to report food intake, or total energy and protein content of the diet. The role of a variety of dietary and other interventions cannot be effectively evaluated without more detailed dietary disclosure and information about potential confounding effect of dietary factors. Correct interpretation of outcomes with a particular intervention is enabled when full dietary disclosure accompanies rigorous dietary designs. At minimum, diet content and composition should be reported and food intake assessed during the study. Figure 2 that meets minimum basic criteria of dietary design would facilitate comparison of preclinical studies and replication of studies between research groups. Standardizing dietary designs in studies that are using preclinical models to explore important questions regarding mechanisms and interventions for cancer cachexia would be an important step to moving preclinical findings to human application.",
