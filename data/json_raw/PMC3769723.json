The growth of these organisms is a consequence of the nutritional sources used as also of the physical conditions employed to cultivate them. In this work, the automated Bioscreen C system was used to evaluate the influence of different nutritional sources on the growth of Trichoderma strains (T. hamatum, T. harzianum, T. viride, and T. longibrachiatum) isolated from the soil in the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station (JIES), S\u00e3o Paulo State-Brazil. The cultures were grown in liquid culture media containing different carbon-(2%; w/v) and nitrogen (1%; w/v) sources at 28\u00baC, pH 6.5, and agitated at 150 rpm for 72 h. The results showed, as expected, that glucose is superior to sucrose as a growth-stimulating carbon source in the Trichoderma strains studied, while yeast extract and tryptone were good growth-stimulating nitrogen sources in the cultivation of T. hamatum and T. harzianum.",

Because of these properties, this genus has high biotechnological potential and is found in almost all ecosystems. Several studies have been carried out on Brazilian soil, such as in the Paranapiacaba Biological Reserve, SP (3). In order to improve knowledge of the biodiversity of soil microbiota, 112 fungi species were isolated and identified from the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station (JIES), S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil (31). These species are currently being studied with respect to their potential for producing macromolecules of interest to medicine and industry. The same authors determined that some of these strains are able to produce enzymes like xylanases and fatty acids including \u03b3-linolenic acid (GLA), and observed that the species of Trichoderma probably plays an important role in soil nutrient recycling (20,28).",

With regard to the differences among the average scores per period (Table 1), it can be seen when individually analyzed against the control that in T. hamatum vs. T. viride and in the strains of T. hamatum, T. harzianum, and T. longibrachiatum, all presented values of p<0.05 in most periods, and their growth rates were considered highly significant. Besides, T. hamatum differed not only from the control but also from T. viride, which did not happen with T. harzianum and T. longibrachiatum; whereas, growth rates of both T. harzianum and T. longibrachiatum differed only from the control, but not from each other. Thus, it can be concluded from these observations that T. hamatum presented the highest value of R and consequently higher growth in all periods (Table 2).

From this period, the strain started to differ significantly from both T. viride (in the cultivation with yeast extract and glucose) and T. longibrachiatum (when cultivated in yeast extract and sucrose) ( Table 1). Analyzing only the nitrogen sources in function of the carbon sources used, it was observed that the growth of T. harzianum was 30% higher with yeast extract plus glucose than with tryptone plus glucose (Figs. 1, 2). The same pattern was observed with regard to media with sucrose, where the growth with yeast extract was 65% higher than with tryptone (Figs. 1, 2). Thus, yeast extract appears to be the best nitrogen source for T. harzianum, compared to tryptone, apart from the carbon source used in this study. Studies involving xylanase production indicated that T. harzianum is a good producer of xylanases in media containing yeast extract (7). The comparative analysis of the carbon sources in function of the nitrogen sources showed that in the presence of tryptone, growth of T. harzianum in the cultures with glucose was 15% higher than that in sucrose (Fig.  1), while in presence of yeast extract the growth was 10% higher in the cultures with sucrose than in those with glucose (Fig. 2).",

Considering only the influence of sugar, it can be seen that growth of T. hamatum was 40% higher in glucose than in sucrose in presence of tryptone as nitrogen source (Fig. 1). Likewise, the growth of T. hamatum was 45% higher in glucose than in sucrose in the medium with yeast extract (Fig. 2). These results indicate that for T. hamatum cultivation, glucose is better than sucrose as carbon source, irrespective of the nitrogen source used. Analyzing influence of the nitrogen source on the growth rate of T. hamatum, a slightly higher growth (20%) could be observed in yeast extract than in tryptone, when glucose was present in the medium (Figs.  1, 2). Almost the same result was detected when sucrose was used as carbon source, in which growth of T. hamatum was 15% higher than in yeast extract, indicating that in this strain yeast extract induces a higher growth rate (Figs. 1, 2).",
