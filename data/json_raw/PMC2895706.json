            "text": "Although noodles occupy an important place in the dietary lives of Americans, up until the present time research and in-depth data on the noodle consumption patterns of the US population have been very limited. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the food consumption and diet patterns of noodle consumers and non-consumers according to age, gender, income, and ethnicity. The 2001-2002 NHANES databases were used. The NHANES 2001-2002 data showed that noodle consumers reporting noodle consumption in their 24-h recall were 2,035 individuals (23.3% of total subjects). According to the results, the mean noodle consumption was 304.1 g/day/person, with 334.3 g for males and 268.0 g for females. By age, the intake of those in the age range of 9-18 years old ranked highest at 353.0 g, followed by the order of 19-50 year-olds with 333.5 g, 51-70 year-olds with by 280.4 g, older than 71years old with 252.3 g, and 1-8 year-olds with 221.5 g. By gender, males consumed more noodles than females. Also, according to income, the intake amount for the middle-income level (PIR 1~1.85) of consumers was highest at 312.5 g. Noodle intake also showed different patterns by ethnicity in which the \"other\" ethnic group consumed the most noodles with 366.1 g, followed by, in order, Hispanics with 318.7 g, Whites with 298.6 g, and Blacks with 289.5 g. After comparing food consumption by dividing the subjects into noodle consumers and non-consumers, the former was more likely to consume milk, fish, citrus fruits, tomatoes, and alcoholic beverages while the latter preferred meat, poultry, bread, and non-alcohol beverages.",

Dietary patterns and food groups reflect different ethnic eating traditions [5]. Mediterranean and Asian diets are widely known to incorporate higher intakes of legumes, fish, vegetables, and fruits, contrasted with the American dietary pattern consisting of higher intakes of deep-fried fast foods, refined grains, processed meats, commercially baked products, and sweets. Understanding these ethnic differences in food group consumption becomes increasingly significant in the United States as the US Census Bureau has reported that, from 1990 to 2000, the foreign-born population increased by 57% to represent 13% of the total US population [6].",

This article provides information on current noodle consumption patterns in the United States and the dietary intake of noodles by consumers in general. It also offers analyses of noodle consumers by income, race, and ethnicity. The primary objective of the research was to gain a better understanding of noodle consumption in the United States and whether consuming noodles has a beneficial effect on total diet, in which they may play a role in healthful eating. The contribution of economic, social, and demographic factors related to noodle consumption were examined. The differences in noodle consumption by income level and ethnic background provide insights into the factors that affect food selection among these groups. The results provide useful information for designing food programs and planning national food supply strategies.",

Moreover, the noodle consumers differed from the non-noodle consumers in their food intake. When the two groups were compared, the noodle consumers showed food choices that contained more tomatoes and less beef, poultry, sandwiches, legumes, breads, ready-to-eat cereals, grain mixtures, white potatoes, and vegetable mixtures. While a causal relationship was not found, noodle consumption was associated with the choice of other food groups that were consumed with noodles.",

There were significant differences between ethnic groups in their rankings of the vast quantity intake foodstuffs as compared to other demographic factors such as gender, age, and PIR. Differences in noodle consumption among age and racial groups explain changes in both food preferences among the age groups and the different populations. In the case of the \"other\" ethnic group, including Asians, noodles and ready-toeat-cereals held especially high rankings in the vast quantity intake foodstuffs. These results are due to Asian culture where noodles are a staple food. There are, however, a number of problems that remain to be explored. In this study, the source of data lacked accurate demographic information. NHANES data make no distinction between \"other\" ethnic groups. Therefore, it is difficult to research the actual conditions of noodle intake in various racial and ethnic groups belonging to the \"other\" category. Another limitation of our analysis is there was no consideration for eating location (at home or away from home).",

It is probable that the major sources of noodles are pasta and spaghetti. On the other hand, the noodle consumers had a tendency of consuming less amounts of vegetables, beans and domestic fowl as compared to those of non-noodle consumers. The inclusion of noodles in planning menus for school lunch programs or food assistance programs may further encourage the consumption of a varied diet that contains more vegetables, legumes, poultry, and beef. In addition, noodle consumers may benefit from new recipes in which noodles, particularly nutrient fortified noodles, are used in combination with vegetables and legumes. Finally, further research is necessary to examine shifts in noodle consumption by passage of time and demographic factors.",
