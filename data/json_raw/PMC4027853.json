            "text": "Interleukin (IL)-17 has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and cancer. The IL-17A (-197G/A) and IL-17F (7488T/C) polymorphisms have been extensively investigated with cancer risk, but individually published results have been inconclusive. The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of the IL-17A (-197G/A) and IL-17F (7488T/C) polymorphisms on cancer risk in Asian populations. Relevant studies were identified by searching databases extensively. The association between the IL-17A (-197G/A) and IL-17F (7488T/C) polymorphisms and cancer risk was assessed by odds ratios (ORs) together with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 12 articles with adequate information satisfied our inclusion criteria; these included 12 studies, with 4,540 cases and 5,875 controls, of IL-17A (-197G/A) polymorphism and seven studies, with 1,960 cases and 3,226 controls, of IL-17F (7488T/C) polymorphism. In the overall analysis, the IL-17A (-197G/A) polymorphism was significantly associated with increased cancer risk (P,0.05), for all genetic models. However, there was no statistically significant association between IL-17F (7488T/C) and cancer risk (P.0.05), for any genetic models. Furthermore, stratification by cancer type revealed a significant correlation between the IL-17A (-197G/A) polymorphism and cancer risk for all cancer types. When stratified by source of controls, a significant correlation was observed between the IL-17A (-197G/A) polymorphism and cancer risk in the populationbased control subgroup but not in hospital-based control subgroup. In conclusion, our metaanalysis provides evidence that the IL-17A (-197G/A) polymorphism might be associated with cancer risk, while no evidence suggested a significant association between IL-17F (7488T/C) polymorphism and cancer risk."

            "text": "Interleukin (IL)-17A, initially termed as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA)-8, is the founding member of IL-17 cytokine family, consisting of six homologous proteins (from IL-17A to IL-17F). 1 IL-17 is a pleiotropic cytokine that acts on multiple cell types to enhance the production of proinflammatory molecules, including the induction of IL-6, IL-8, and prostaglandin E 2 , as well as enhancing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and CXC chemokine production. 2,3 In addition, IL-17 induces secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and stromelysin, by macrophages, 4,5 and activates the nuclear factor \u03baB and activator protein 1 transcription factors, which may explain its proinflammatory properties. 6,7 Recently, several studies have shown that IL-17 can have either a protumor or antitumor role in different cancer models. 8 Accumulating evidence indicates that IL-17 expression is aberrant in several human tumors, such as ovarian cancer, 9 cervical cancer, 10 breast cancer, 11 hepatocellular carcinoma, 12 esophageal cancer, 13 gastric cancer, 14 and colorectal cancer. 15 But the underlying mechanism of IL-17 in tumor initiation and progression is not yet completely clear. Of note, Kryczek et al suggested that endogenous IL-17 or/and T helper (Th)17 cells may play a protective role in tumor immunity. 16 Martin-Orozco et al reported that IL-17A-deficient mice were more susceptible to developing lung melanoma. 17 These studies showed an opposite role of IL-17; specifically, they suggest an antitumor effect, by promoting cytotoxic T lymphocyte generation.",

There are several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are reported for the IL-17 gene, and the IL-17A gene polymorphism IL-17A (-197G/A, rs2275913) and IL-17F gene polymorphism IL-17F (7488T/C, rs763780) are reported to be associated in gastric carcinogenesis. 18 IL-17A (-197G/A), located at a position -197 from the starting codon of the IL-17A gene, may regulate the expression of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). 19 Recently, Kawaguchi et al reported that IL-17F (7488T/C) causes a histidine (His)-to-arginine (Arg) substitution at amino acid 161 (H161R) variant. 20 To date, many studies have been published that assessed the association between the IL-17A (-197G/A) and IL-17F (7488T/C) polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility, but they have reported controversial results. A single case-control study may fail to completely demonstrate the complicated genetic relationship because of the small sample size. 21 In order to provide strong evidence of the effects of the IL-17A (-197G/A) and IL-17F (7488T/C) polymorphisms on cancer susceptibility, we performed a meta-analysis, by combining data from numerous published studies.",

Meta-analysis is considered a powerful tool for combining the contradicting results from different studies to achieve greater statistical power and obtain more reliable results than with a single study. 37 In this metaanalysis, we investigated the association between IL-17A (-197G/A) (rs2275913) and IL-17F (7488T/C) (rs763780) and cancer risk. Overall, our study provided evidence that IL-17A (-197G/A) polymorphism was associated with cancer susceptibility.

            "text": "IL-17 family members belong to a distinct category of cytokine and are involved in coordinating local tissue inflammation, through release of proinflammatory and neutrophil-mobilizing cytokines. 20 To date, investigation into the function of the IL-17 cytokine family has been extensive, but the majority of the effort has focused on the role of two members, IL-17A and IL-17F. The IL-17A and IL-17F genes are both located at 6p12. In addition, among the IL-17 family, from the alignment of the amino acid sequences, IL-17A and IL-17F have the highest overall amino acid sequence identity and share similar functions in terms of their ability to induce chemokines, which are important in neutrophil recruitment and activation. 31 IL-17A and IL-17F cytokines are both expressed by Th17 cells, which mediate chronic inflammation and cancer. 9 Although the significance of IL-17A and -17F in the pathogenesis of the cancer has still remained unclear, we hypothesized that both the cytokines may affect the development of chronic inflammation followed by malignancy, coordinately or independently. Over the last several years, many studies have identified a variety of environmental, host immune status, and host genetic factors that play important roles in carcinogenesis. Moreover, Espinoza et al reported that IL-17A (-197G/A) polymorphism influences the response of the IL-17 gene promoter to factors released in response to T cell activation, thus leading to a differential IL-17 production. 38 Kawaguchi et al revealed that IL-17F (7488T/C), which causes a His-to-Arg substitution at amino acid 161 (H161R) of IL-17F, lacked the ability to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, cytokine production, and chemokine production, and blocked induction of IL-8 expression by wild type IL-17F in in vitro functional experiments. 39 Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the polymorphisms of two cytokines on cancer risk. Our investigation suggests that IL-17A (-197G/A), but not IL-17F (7488T/C), contributes to cancer susceptibility.",

Moreover, stratified analysis by source of controls suggested that IL-17A (-197G/A) polymorphism was associated with increased risk of cancer in the population-based control subgroup, but not in the hospital-based control subgroup. This may have been due to some selection biases existing in the hospital-based studies because such controls may have come from a population with a related disease and may not have been representative of the general population. For IL-17F (7488T/C) polymorphism, we found little association between IL-17F (7488T/C) polymorphism and cancer risk in subgroups analysis.

Although two potential sources of the heterogeneity were investigated, including the source of controls and cancer types, neither of them sufficiently explained the between-study heterogeneity. Second, the sample size is not large enough, especially for subgroup analysis. Thus, we do not have adequate power to evaluate the possible association for both polymorphisms, and the observed significant associations in some subgroup analysis may be not accurate. Third, the lack of observations concerning gene-gene and gene-environment interactions could have influenced our results. Fourth, only published studies were included in the meta-analysis, and nonsignificant or negative findings may be unpublished. Hence, some inevitable publication biases might exist in the results."
