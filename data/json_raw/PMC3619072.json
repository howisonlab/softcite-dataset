            "text": "Background: Human papillomavirus 16 infection has been proven to be associated with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and is probably the main reason of the reported increase in the incidence. The role of high-risk (HR) HPV for carcinogenesis of other sites in the head and neck awaits confirmation. With the aim to evaluate the prevalence of HPV infection and the reliability of different diagnostic tools in SCCs of different sites, 109 consecutive untreated head and neck SCCs were enroled, and fresh tumour samples collected. Methods: Human papillomavirus DNA was detected by Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2). Human papillomavirus E6 and E7 mRNA were detected by NucliSENS EasyQ HPVv1. P16 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Results: In all, 12.84% of cases were infected by HR genotypes and 1.84% by low-risk genotypes. Human papillomavirus 16 accounted for 87% of HR infections. The overall agreement between DNA and RNA detection is 99.1%. Although p16 expression clearly correlates with HPV infection (P \u00bc 0.0051), the inter-rater agreement is poor (k \u00bc 0.27). The oropharynx showed the highest HR HPV infection rate (47.6%) and was also the only site in which p16 immunohistochemistry revealed to be a fair, but not excellent, diagnostic assay (k \u00bc 0.61). Conclusion: The prognostic role of HR HPV infection in oropharyngeal oncology, with its potential clinical applications, underscores the need for a consensus on the most appropriate detection methods. The present results suggest that viral mRNA detection could be the standard for fresh samples, whereas DNA detection could be routinely used in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples."

Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas grossly accounts for 3.5% of all malignant tumours in the United States (Siegel et al, 2011), although in other parts of the world, such as India, Southeast Asia and Brazil, these tumours are much more prevalent (Shah and Lydiatt, 1995).",

            "text": "The best established risk factors are cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse (Shah and Patel, 2003;De Vita et al, 2008), although infection with high-risk (HR) HPV, whose role in carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix has been extensively studied (De Vita et al, 2008), is another emerging risk factor. The emergence of HR HPV infection underlies the marked increase in oropharyngeal SCC incidence (Hammarstedt et al, 2006;Chaturvedi et al, 2011), especially in the young (Sturgis and Cinciripini, 2007). Nevertheless, HNSCCs are an extremely heterogeneous group of tumours both from a molecular (Huang et al, 2002;Bosch et al, 2004) and a clinical point of view (Shah and Patel, 2003). The main clinical heterogeneity factor is the site of origin, which correlates with specific risk factors, symptoms, stage at diagnosis, tendency to local and distant metastasis, chemo-and radiosensitivity and ultimately prognosis (Shah and Patel, 2003;De Vita et al, 2008). In this context, the role of HR HPV in oropharyngeal carcinogenesis is established, as HPV infection predicts chemo-radiosensitivity and better prognosis (Gillison et al, 2000;Gillison, 2009;Ang et al, 2010); on the other hand, evidence of its significance in other head and neck sites is definitely lacking (Gillison et al, 2000).",

Most of the acquired data on HPVdriven carcinogenesis comes from the uterine cervix model, although its validity in head and neck remains to be confirmed. For example, studies on the cervix model assigned the most significant role in the induction of malignant transformation to the E6 and E7 genes and their respective proteins (Munger et al, 1989;McDougall, 1994), showing that E7 interacts with and degrades RB, which then releases the transcription factor E2F from RB inhibition and upregulates p16 INK4A , providing the molecular basis for the typical p16 overexpression in cervical SCC (Dyson et al, 1989;Kiyono et al, 1998). Hence, detection of p16 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been proposed as a surrogate for HPV detection in the head and neck.",

The overall agreement between the HPV genomic DNA detection results and the mRNA detection was close to 100% (k \u00bc 0.96), being absolute in all sites except the glottic larynx, where the Digene test missed an unexpected positivity for the mRNA of HPV45, associated with HNSCC in only a few reports (Lindel et al, 2001).

The results of this study confirm the relevance of HPV infection as a risk factor for oropharyngeal SCC (Gillison et al, 2000;Gillison, 2009). However, the prevalence of HPV infection in SCC of other head and neck sites was found definitely lower than what was reported in recent studies (Sethi et al, 2011;Heath et al, 2012). Hence, the role of HPV as a risk factor for non-oropharyngeal sites remains to be fully evaluated, appearing certainly less relevant. The subsite with the highest prevalence (13.3%) outside the oropharynx was the supraglottic larynx, whose marginal region is contiguous with the oropharynx. This may explain the HR HPV infection rate reported in some studies on laryngeal SCCs (Almadori et al, 2001(Almadori et al, , 2002. Notably, our total (13%) and oropharyngeal (47.6%) positivity rates are very close to those from a recent study evaluating the overall genetic pattern of HNSCCs (Stransky et al, 2011) in a different population from a different geographic area (North America).",

In this study, viral genomic DNA detection shows 100% specificity (no falsepositive cases) when compared with the mRNA detection test. In addition, only the HPV45-positive case (sensitivity: 93%) was not detected by the genomic DNA technique used, which may therefore be considered a perfect surrogate of HPV16 mRNA detection in HNSCC samples. Such reliability of genomic DNA HPV-detecting techniques in HNSCCs seems confirmed also by the recent influential paper of Stransky and co-workers (2011), performing an accurate mutational profiling. Some authors (Smeets et al, 2007;Marur et al, 2010;El-Naggar and Westra, 2011;Harris et al, 2011) expressed concerns on the use of p16 IHC as a surrogate marker for the HPV infection in the head and neck. However, several groups, probably assuming that data acquired from the uterine cervix could be easily translated in other models, have considered for a long time p16 expression as equivalent to HPV infection in all head and neck sites, even those outside the oropharynx (Lassen et al, 2011), where the prevalence of proved HR HPV infection was markedly lower (Gillison et al, 2000;Stransky et al, 2011). These assumptions may have detracted from a thorough evaluation of diagnostic tools for HPV in head and neck oncology and may have led to an overestimation of the HPV infection relevance in head and neck carcinogenesis (Kaminagakura et al, 2011;Lassen et al, 2011). A recent study (Schlecht et al, 2011) compared p16 IHC with in situ hybridisation and concluded that the former is a better surrogate for HPV mRNA detection, despite the reported sensitivity of 69% in the oropharynx and only 52% in the head and neck as a whole. The overall low specificity of p16 IHC for the diagnosis of HR HPV In the left part of the table the agreement (j) of Digene (HPV DNA) and p16 IHC with the reference method (RNA), by site of origin is shown. In the right part, the results of the different detection methods are shown in detail for each subsite, evidencing that HPV16 is by far the most frequent genotype (12 out of 14 high-risk cases), and the only one in the oropharynx, and that most positive cases (10 out of 14) arose from the tonsil and from the base of the tongue. The only high-risk case missed by Digene was in the glottic larynx and was positive for HPV45 RNA.",

            "text": "infection in the present series is striking and is certainly very different to what was observed in the cervix, in which virtually all the SCCs are associated with HR HPV and p16 overexpression. In the head and neck, where causative factors, clinical behaviours and molecular profiles, are definitely more heterogeneous (Braakhuis et al, 2004;Agrawal et al, 2011;Stransky et al, 2011), p16 overexpression may derive from different mechanisms than HR HPV infection (El-Naggar and Westra, 2011), especially in mobile tongue SCC (53% of positivity without any demonstration of HR HPV infection in the present series). The present results undermine the usefulness of p16 as a diagnostic surrogate for HPV infection in sites outside the oropharynx. In the oropharynx, p16 overexpression is associated with HPV infection, and agreement can be considered fair (k \u00bc 0.61) but not excellent. A recent work demonstrated a low diagnostic value for p16 immunohistochemistry in oropharyngeal SCCs arising outside tonsils and base of tongue (Marklund et al, 2012). In our opinion, even in the oropharynx, there is no reason to prefer a surrogate, such as p16 IHC, to more reliable and direct diagnostic methods based on HPV nucleic acid detection, which are objective, as they do not require the reading of a trained histopathologist, and are becoming less expensive and widely available in the microbiology departments all over the world. Another option for the diagnosis of HPV infection in FFPE samples could be the algorithm proposed by Smeets et al (2007)), involving both p16 immunohistochemistry and GP5 \u00fe / 6 \u00fe PCR.",

            "text": "One of the main issues of head and neck oncology is that, despite the multiplicity of clinical prognosticators, the only consistent clinical predictors for disease control and diseasespecific survival of SCCs are T and, to a greater extent, N (Spector et al, 2001;Franchin et al, 2003;Licitra et al, 2003;Shah and Patel, 2003), and the stratification of patients remains often inadequate. This is probably due, in spite of the histological homogeneity (most head and neck malignancies are SCC), to the extreme biological heterogeneity, and contributes to a lack of consistency in treatment planning. The molecular characterisation is an attempt to define homogeneous groups of patients for prognosis as well as for responsiveness to treatments (Almadori et al, 2005). The growing body of evidence about the prognostic role of HR HPV infection in oropharyngeal oncology (Gillison et al, 2000;Kumar et al, 2008;Worden et al, 2008;Gillison, 2009;Ang et al, 2010), which is associated with a better prognosis and an increased radiosensitivity, suggests that it may be a useful molecular marker to be integrated in the clinical management of oropharyngeal SCCs. Nevertheless, the inconsistency of detection methods for the most studied molecular markers in head and neck oncology, and for HPV infection in particular, is probably one of the main obstacles to their employment in the clinic (Almadori et al, 2008;Bussu et al, 2012). For this reason, a consensus on the methods to be used for HR HPV detection in HNSCC is mandatory (Braakhuis et al, 2009), and this study provides useful indications. In fact, mRNA detection, considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of HPV infection (Braakhuis et al, 2004;Shi et al, 2009;Schlecht et al, 2011), could be performed when fresh tumour samples are available; on the other hand, genomic DNA-based methods, alone or combined with other assays in a diagnostic algorithm (Smeets et al, 2007), if the high specificity of new genomic DNA detecting techniques will be confirmed and validated, could be used on common FFPE samples.",
