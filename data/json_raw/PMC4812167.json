            "text": "Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive brain tumor in adults. The introduction of temozolomide (TMZ) has advanced chemotherapy for malignant gliomas, but it is not curative. The difficulties in treating glioblastoma may be as a result of the presence of glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are a source of relapse and chemoresistance. Another reason may be that endogenous Akt kinase activity may be activated in response to clinically relevant concentrations of TMZ. Akt activation is correlated with the increased tumorigenicity, invasiveness and stemness of cancer cells and overexpression of an active form of Akt increases glioma cell resistance to TMZ. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that cancer stem cells are preferentially sensitive to an inhibitor of Akt and down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway may enhance the cytotoxicity of TMZ. Metformin (MET), the first-line drug for treating diabetes, it has been proved that it reduces AKT activation and selectively kills cancer stem cells, but whether it can potentiate the cytotoxicity of TMZ for GSCs remains unknown. In the present study, the GSCs isolated from human glioma cell line U87 and Rat glioma cell line C6, in vitro treatment with TMZ either alone or with MET. The present study demonstrates that MET acts synergistically with TMZ in inhibiting GSCs proliferation and generating the highest apoptotic rates when compared to either drug alone. These findings implicate that GSCs cytotoxicity mediated by TMZ may be stimulated by MET, have a synergistic effect, but the definite mechanisms remain elusive.",

            "text": "Glioblastoma is the most common and devastating primary malignant intracranial tumor in adults (1). The current standard of care (SOC) for newly diagnosed glioblastomas is surgical resection followed by radiotherapy (RT) plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) (2). The prognosis remains relatively poor with a median overall survival of only 14.6 months, median progression free survival of 6.9 months and 5 year survival rate of only 9.8% following diagnosis (2,3). The fast recurrence and multi-drug resistance are some of the key challenges in combating brain tumors. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are considered to be a major source of relapse and chemoresistance (4), and are therefore an important therapeutic target for glioblastoma.",

At present, the most effective drug for the treatment of glioblastoma is TMZ, the primary path leading to glioma cell death is formation of O-6-methylguanine and apoptotic signalling triggered by O-6-methyl G:T mispairs, but apoptotic signalling goes through a step mediated by AMPK (12).

As shown in Fig. 4 and Table II, U87-GSCs cultured in NBM with B27, N2, glutaMAX, heparin and EGF+bFGF showed 62.79% G0/G1 cells, 18.3% G2/M cells and 18.91% S-phase cells, addition of TMZ or MET resulted in a reduction in G0/G1 cells (45.19 and 59.2%, respectively), a marked increase in G2/M cells (34.49 and 22.19%, respectively) and an increase in S-phase cells (20.32 and 18.61%, respectively). However, when U87-GSCs were treated with TMZ plus MET, a greater reduction in G0/G1 cells (22.67%; P<0.05), and a greater increase in G2/M and S-phase cells was observed (48.89 and 28.43%, respectively; P<0.05). This result indicates that the U87-GSC cells were arrested at the G2/M phase by TMZ or MET treatment, but TMZ plus MET induced cell cycle arrest at both the G2/M phase and S-phase; the effect was markedly better than treatment with a single agent, particularly for the G2/M phase arrest. C6-GSCs, cultured in NBM with B27, N2, glutaMAX, heparin and EGF+bFGF, were analyzed by flow cytometry and the result demonstrated that 66.43% cells were in G0/G1, 8.53% were in G2/M and 25.04% were in S-phase.

Fig. 6 demonstrates that when GSCs were treated with TMZ alone for 72 h, Akt phosphorylation is slightly enhanced. However, Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by MET, suggesting that Akt inhibition is required for MET antiproliferative activity in GSCs. Notably, the phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt) levels were markedly down-regulated compared with the control group and Table I. Combination treatments with TMZ and MET synergistically inhibit cell growth in U87-GSCs and C6-GSCs. Cells were treated with a 1:50 combination (ratio) of TMZ:MET at the indicated concentrations. Percentage growth inhibition of the combination treatments was calculated compared to untreated cells (DMSO). Calcusyn software was used to ascertain the combination index to determine whether combination treatments have an additive or synergistic effect. CI values <1.0, =1, and >1.0 indicates synergistic interaction (more than additive), summation (additive), and antagonistic interaction (less than additive), respectively. TMZ, temozolomid; MET, metformin; CI, Combination index. TMZ alone groups compared with treatment with TMZ and MET in combination. These results indicate that the potential mechanism of MET enhancing TMZ cytotoxicity may involve down-regulation of P-Akt.",

GSCs are a small population of cells that have self-renewal, transplantation, recurrence properties and multidrug resistance (26). The identification of stem-like cells in tumors and the proposed role for this subpopulation in drug resistance opened the search for targeted molecular therapies and novel drugs able to deplete this tumor cell subpopulation, either by activating differentiation or through selective toxicity that causes loss of self-renewal (19). However, in medicine, it is usually difficult to get agents with high target specificity; only a few of compounds have showed selective toxicity for cancer stem cells (27,28). However, certain drugs already used in the clinic that may have encouraging results, such as MET, may selectively kill cancer stem cells (16)(17)(18)(19) with minor adverse events (20).",

Instead, AMPK activation may be a response mechanism to counter stress induced by anticancer agents (30). It is possible that the growth-inhibiting effects are a combination of the AMPK-independent mTOR-dependent cellular and systemic effects of MET (30).

It has been proved that TMZ combined with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibits melanoma cell growth, survival and invasion (31); and similar results were observed in glioma cells (11). Akt activation has been reported to suppress activation of the G2 checkpoint in human colon carcinoma cells exposed to radiation (32), Akt activation has also been proven to suppresses TMZ-induced G2 arrest (5). However, in our trial, MET, through the inhibition of Akt activation, selectively killed cancer stem cells and acted synergetic with TMZ, enhancing TMZ-induced G2 arrest for U87-GSCs; however, in C6-GSCs, they just reinforced each other and induced cell cycle arrest at S phase. Based on the experimental results of the present study, MET may enhance the cytotoxicity of TMZ by down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, these results warrant further in vivo exploration.",

U87 and C6 gliospheres were cultured for 7 days, immunocytochemical staining of (A) the cancer stem cell marker, CD133, and (B) the neural progenitor marker, nestin, in U87-GSC and C6-GSC cells. (C) Following differentiation, the U87 and C6 glioma cells were immunostained with \u03b2-tubulin-III and GFAP. The fluorescent signals were detected and images were captured at x200 magnification. GSCs, glioma stem cells; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein. GSCs were treated with TMZ plus MET resulted in a greater reduction in the percentage of G0/G1 cells (43.09%; P<0.05) and a marked increase in the percentage of cells in S-phase (31.92%; P<0.05). These results indicated that the C6-GSCs cycles were arrested at S phase following treatment with TMZ plus MET; however, little difference was observed in the percentage of C6-GSCs in G2/M arrest when treated with TMZ plus MET compared with either single agent. These results suggest that TMZ plus MET treatment regulates cell cycle progression of GSCs in culture and using the agents together enhances the effects.TMZ plus MET significantly induced apoptosis in GSCs. The present study also aimed to determine whether the TMZ or",
