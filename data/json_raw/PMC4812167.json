            "text": "Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive brain tumor in adults. The introduction of temozolomide (TMZ) has advanced chemotherapy for malignant gliomas, but it is not curative. The difficulties in treating glioblastoma may be as a result of the presence of glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are a source of relapse and chemoresistance. Another reason may be that endogenous Akt kinase activity may be activated in response to clinically relevant concentrations of TMZ. Akt activation is correlated with the increased tumorigenicity, invasiveness and stemness of cancer cells and overexpression of an active form of Akt increases glioma cell resistance to TMZ. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that cancer stem cells are preferentially sensitive to an inhibitor of Akt and down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway may enhance the cytotoxicity of TMZ. Metformin (MET), the first-line drug for treating diabetes, it has been proved that it reduces AKT activation and selectively kills cancer stem cells, but whether it can potentiate the cytotoxicity of TMZ for GSCs remains unknown. In the present study, the GSCs isolated from human glioma cell line U87 and Rat glioma cell line C6, in vitro treatment with TMZ either alone or with MET. The present study demonstrates that MET acts synergistically with TMZ in inhibiting GSCs proliferation and generating the highest apoptotic rates when compared to either drug alone. These findings implicate that GSCs cytotoxicity mediated by TMZ may be stimulated by MET, have a synergistic effect, but the definite mechanisms remain elusive."

            "text": "Glioblastoma is the most common and devastating primary malignant intracranial tumor in adults (1). The current standard of care (SOC) for newly diagnosed glioblastomas is surgical resection followed by radiotherapy (RT) plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) (2). The prognosis remains relatively poor with a median overall survival of only 14.6 months, median progression free survival of 6.9 months and 5 year survival rate of only 9.8% following diagnosis (2,3). The fast recurrence and multi-drug resistance are some of the key challenges in combating brain tumors. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are considered to be a major source of relapse and chemoresistance (4), and are therefore an important therapeutic target for glioblastoma.",

Instead, AMPK activation may be a response mechanism to counter stress induced by anticancer agents (30). It is possible that the growth-inhibiting effects are a combination of the AMPK-independent mTOR-dependent cellular and systemic effects of MET (30). Gritti et al (16) determined that MET exhibits its selective antiproliferative effects in human GSCs via inhibition of the CLIC1-mediated ion current, although this requires further studies to confirm this observation.",

It has been proved that TMZ combined with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibits melanoma cell growth, survival and invasion (31); and similar results were observed in glioma cells (11). Akt activation has been reported to suppress activation of the G2 checkpoint in human colon carcinoma cells exposed to radiation (32), Akt activation has also been proven to suppresses TMZ-induced G2 arrest (5). However, in our trial, MET, through the inhibition of Akt activation, selectively killed cancer stem cells and acted synergetic with TMZ, enhancing TMZ-induced G2 arrest for U87-GSCs; however, in C6-GSCs, they just reinforced each other and induced cell cycle arrest at S phase. Based on the experimental results of the present study, MET may enhance the cytotoxicity of TMZ by down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, these results warrant further in vivo exploration.",
