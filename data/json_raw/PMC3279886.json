The present study was conducted to compare the parasitic fauna of Blicca bjeorkna, as an endemic fish and Hemiculter leucisculus, as an introduced fish to the lagoon. Methods: A parasitological investigation was done on 78 specimens of B. bjoerkna and 114 of H. leucisculus. The fishes were collected from August 2009 to April 2010 by the electro fishing from Anzali Lagoon. Results: Eleven parasites species were found in 192 fish samples. The prevalence and mean intensity of parasites in each host were as follows:",

            "text": "nzali Lagoon is a very important reservoir in the Caspian Sea Fauna Region (North of Iran), there are some fish parasites recorded from this area such as: Diplostomum spathaceum from Esox lucius, Perca fluviatilis, Carassius carassius, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Cyprinus carpio, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Tinca tinca, and Abramis brama; Raphidascaris acus from Esox lucius, Abramis brama, Tinca tinca, Carassius carassius and Perca fluviatilis. There some more parasites from different fishes such as: Tetraonchus menonteron and Gyrodactylus elegans, Eustrongilides excisus, Rhabdochona hellichi from Esox lucius, Chalcalburnus chalcoides and Cucullanus mulleri from Carassius carassius, Anisakis schupakovi from Silurus glanis, Argulus foliaceus from Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Piscicola geometra and Asymphylodora tincae from Tinca tinca (1). A number of exotic fish species were introduced in Iranian freshwaters. These species encompass 18.7% from the 81% of the fish inhabiting in south part of the Caspian Sea. Hemiculter leucisculus (Saw belly) is one of these species with low economic value. This species might be accidentally transferred to this region with fertilized egg and or larvae of Chinese carp for aquaculture, the place and origin of this fish is Yunnan, south-west of China (2)(3)(4)(5). None-indigenous fish may have undesirable effects on endemic fish species, including destruction of habitat and water quality, predation, aggressive behavior such as fin nipping, retardation of reproductive activity, food competition, and introduction of parasites and disease to the new environment. Levels of parasitism and parasite diversity were significantly greater in native fishes than in exotic species, and this may contribute to an enhanced demographic perform-ance and competitive ability in invading exotics. Levels of parasitism and parasite diversity in native fishes were negatively related to habitat disturbance, in particular to a suite of factors that indicate increased human use of the river and surrounding environment (6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11). Native parasites infecting exotic fish will increase their bio-potential through a vast host range. The exotic fish may play as a reservoir role for maintenance of parasite (8). The aims of this study were to survey the parasite fauna on Blicca bjeorkna, as a native fish, and Hemiculter leucisculus, as an exotic fish, and to compare the prevalence of parasitic infection in these two species.",

The live specimens were transferred to Iranian Aquaculture Research Center (Guilan, Anzali) and were kept in aquariums. Parasitological studies implemented for protozoa and Monogenea on fresh smears of gills, eyes, skin, and fins by stereo and light microscope. Examined fish were fixed in formalin (10%) and transferred to Aquatic Research Laboratory (Shahid Beheshti University) for further study of other metazoan parasites. The parasites were identified according to key of Moravec 1994, 1998, Bykhovskaya 1964, Shulman 1984 and Lom & Dykova 1992 (10,(12)(13)(14)(15)(16).",

The endemic fish was infected more than exotic fish and more parasites diversity was observed in endemic fish than exotic species. Some of parasitic species were seen in both fishes, but some others were only in B. bjoerkna or H. leucisculus. More specific parasites were found in B. bjoerkna whereas they were not identified in H. leucisculus.
