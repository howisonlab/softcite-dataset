            "text": "Background Ever since lipoabdominoplasty was first developed to achieve better aesthetic outcomes and less morbidity, the rate of seroma formation, especially in obese patients, has disturbed plastic surgeons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fibrin sealant in the prevention of seroma formation after lipoabdominoplasty in obese patients. Methods Sixty patients with a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 39.9 were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 groups (30 patients each). Group A underwent lipoabdominoplasty with fibrin glue, while group B underwent traditional lipoabdominoplasty; both had closed suction drainage applied to the abdomen. The patients' demographics and postoperative complications were recorded. Seroma was detected using abdominal ultrasound examinations at two postop erative periods: between postoperative days 10 and 12 and, between postoperative days 18 and 21. Results The age range was 31 to 55 years (38.5 \u00b1 9.5 years) in group A and 25 to 58 years (37.8 \u00b1 9.1 years) in group B, while the mean BMI was 31.4 to 39.9 kg/m 2 (32.6 kg/m 2) in group A and 32.7 to 37.4 kg/m 2 (31.5 kg/m 2) in group B. In group A, the patients had a complication rate of 10% in group A versus 43% in group B (P < 0.05). The incidence of seroma formation was 3% in the fibrin glue group but 37% in the lipoabdominoplastyalone group (P < 0.05). Conclusions Lipoabdominoplasty with the use of autologous fibrin sealant is a very effective method that significantly reduces the rate of postoperative seroma.",

However, postoperative seroma remains an ongoing problem, and the data on its incidence is inconsistent [4]. Some preventive measures have been recommended to reduce the incidence of postoperative seroma, including minimal handling of the skin flap, quilting sutures, use of drains, and the wearing of compression garments during the postoperative period [5,6]. Tissue adhesives have been used to provoke adhesion of the surfaces in many surgical situations and have assisted in reducing the need for drainage and minimizing the rate of postoperative seroma [7,8].",

Two oblique lines of 10 cm each were drawn in the direction of the iliac crest; then the liposuc-tion areas were marked. 2) Venous blood was drawn into a tube containing an anticoagulant (citrate dextrose) to avoid platelet activation and degranulation (50 mL). The first centrifugation, called the \"soft spin\" (3,600 rpm), allows blood separation into three layers, namely the bottom-most RBC layer (55% of total volume), topmost acellular plasma layer called platelet poor plasma (PPP) (40% of total volume), and an intermediate platelet-rich plasma (PRP) layer (5% of total volume) called the \"buffy coat\". This tube underwent a second centrifugation (2,400 rpm), called the \"hard spin\". This allowed the platelets (PRP) to settle at the bottom of the tube with a very few red blood cells. The acellular plasma, PPP (80% of the volume), was found at the top. Most of the PPP was removed with a syringe, and the remaining PRP was shaken well [11]. This PRP was then mixed with bovine thrombin (0.2 mL for every 1 mL of PRP) and 10% calcium chloride (0.1 mL) at the time of application in a petri dish.",

After dissection and trimming of the umbilicus stack; the dissection was continued superiorly to the xiphoid, with lateral dissection up to 7.5 cm from the midline. 5) Plication of the recti was completed in two layers, followed by removal of the excess infraumbilical skin. A V-shaped incision was made 2 cm above where the umbilical position was marked for exteriorization of the umbilicus; then a total of 20 mL of platelet gel was applied in group A patients starting from the xiphoid process to the incision, with continuous external pressure applied to the abdomen after application of every 5 mL until the end of the closure of the incision (Fig. 1). 6) Placement of 2 silicone suction drains was done in both groups, followed by closure of Scarpa's fascia using PDS (2-0) suture. The dermal and subcuticular layers were then sutured using PDS (3-0) suture. A non-adhesive dressing like Vaseline gauze was used.",
