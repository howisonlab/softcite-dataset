            "text": "Per World Health Organization (WHO), indolent lymphomas account for nearly onethird of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). These mainly include follicular lymphoma (FL), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SCL/CLL), and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. 1 Their natural history is characterized by a high initial response rate to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, often with transformation to a more aggressive histology, and followed invariably by disease recurrence. Finally, the patients usually die due to disease progression or treatment-induced toxicity. 2 Addition of rituximab to chemotherapy is associated with higher response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates; [3][4][5] but there is no clear evidence about which chemotherapy regimen should be the proper initial treatment Notes: *With or without rituximab 375 mg/m 2 as an iV infusion on day 0. The chOP arm consisted of \"chOP\" (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone), or \"CHOPE\" (CHOP plus etoposide).

In the late 1980s, the approval of nucleoside analogs such as fludarabine for the treatment of low-grade lymphomas brought significantly increased outcomes, [6][7][8][9] but the benefit with regards to PFS and OS is still under debate, as few trials compared the efficacy of a fludarabine-based regimen with the classical CHOP (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) regimen for NHL. [10][11][12][13] More recently, the use of fludarabine has also raised concerns due to its high toxicities, especially hematological toxicity and infectious complications. 14,15 The present study aimed to evaluate retrospectively both the efficacy and the potential toxicities of the two main regimens (fludarabine-based and CHOP-like regimens) in patients with previously untreated indolent lymphoma.",

It was found that the myelosuppression was mainly presented as neutropenia. No instance of grade 3-4 anemia or thrombocytopenia was recorded among the two treatment arms. In terms of neutropenia, the findings were comparable to those of the randomized FOLL05 trial comparing rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CVP), rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP), and rituximab plus fludarabine, and mitoxantrone for the initial treatment of advanced-stage FL. 13 However, Zinzani et al 10 and Leporrier et al 12 reported no difference in hematologic toxicity between the various treatment groups. 10,12 These differences could partly result from the different treatment regimens, histological subtypes, and patient characteristics. Karmali et al 18 hinted that the bone marrow involvement at presentation could also influence the pathogenesis of prolonged cytopenia in follicular or marginal zone lymphoma with rituximab, fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone (R-FND) followed by radioimmunotherapy consolidation, but the researchers did not give any detailed evidence. In the present study, the multi-factor regression showed no correlation between bone marrow involvement and myelosuppression, although the bone marrow involvement was higher in the FLU arm than the CHOP arm (19/54 [35.2%] vs 6/53 [11.9%]; P = 0.004).",
