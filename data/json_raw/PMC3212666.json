Materials and Methods: From July 2010 to December 2010, 709 persons who came to the hospital for a general checkup were tested. Multiplex PCR assays were done with first voided urine samples or endocervical swabs by use of the Seeplex \u24c7 STD6 ACE Detection kit. Results: The mean age in this study was 45.4\u00b18.1 years. Among the 709 persons, 229 (32.3%) had a positive result for at least one microorganism, 48 (6.8%) had two different species, 6 (0.8%) had three different species, and 1 person had four different species. The overall prevalence of asymptomatic STDs such as urethritis or cervicitis was 7.1% (50/709). The prevalence rates of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, and Trichomonas vaginalis infection in asymptomatic persons were 5.6% (40/709), 0.4% (3/709), 0.3% (2/709), 22.1% (157/709), 11.6% (82/709), and 1.1% (8/709), respectively. Conclusions: With only a single sample, we could identify the prevalence rates of six microorganisms and the overall proportion of urethritis or cervicitis in asymptomatic people. This proportion cannot be neglected; therefore, screening tests for sexually transmitted diseases such as urethritis or cervicitis should be recommended to asymptomatic people."

Chlamydia trachomatis is usually described as an obligate intracellular pathogen and accounts for 30% to 40% of the etiopathogenesis of urethritis [9]. However, about half of infected subjects are asymptomatic. Thus, there are many silent infections in the community. Mason et al showed that the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis in asymptomatic men was 4% (14/349) [10]. Takahashi et al reported that Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 6% of samples from healthy people [11]. Similarly, in our study, Chlamydia trachomatis was observed in 40 persons (5.6%). Unfortunately, it is usually not detected by routine microbiological diagnosis [1,12]. Thus, most asymptomatic patients are neglected unless they visit the clinic to be evaluated for STI by chance or face complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease.",

Our study showed a prevalence of this mycoplasma of 0.3% in asymptomatic people. Mycoplasma genitalium is difficult to identify by routine culture. Currently, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are usually recommended to detect this pathogen [1]. Wikstr\u00f6m and Jensen reported that Mycoplasma genitalium is a common cause of persistent or recurrent urethritis among men treated with doxycycline, and erythromycin appears to be less efficient than azithromycin in eradicating the infection [18].

            "text": "Screening for these pathogens is important not only to identify infected symptomatic individuals for the diagnosis and management of their infections but also to identify asymptomatic individuals who serve as reservoirs for infection [1][2][3][4]. In our study, there were 50 (7.1%) infected people among 709 asymptomatic people; thus, this proportion should not be neglected. Among the 50 infected patients, 37 with Chlamydia trachomatis, 1 with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 1 with Mycoplasma genitalium, 8 with Trichomonas vaginalis, 2 with Chlamydia trachomatis with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and 1 with Chlamydia trachomatis with Mycoplasma genitalium were confirmed. Thus, regardless of Chlamydia trachomatis, 13 patients should be considered as candidates for antimicrobial treatment. Moreover, there were 3 double-infections among the 709 asymptomatic people. These facts suggest the possibility of prescribing the wrong medicines if practitioners give symptomatic patients some regimens empirically. Therefore, the need to detect multiple species at once should be raised. In this sense, use of the multiplex PCR assay to screen asymptomatic people may be important because the treatment regimen could be optimized for people with positive results, especially for those with multiple organisms. This concept can be also applied to symptomatic patients. Ureaplasma urealyticum has been recognized as a pathogen for NGU since the 1950s [21]. However, Ureaplasma urealyticum is frequently isolated from the urethra of healthy men, and some studies have reported that there is no significant difference in its prevalence between men with NGU and men without NGU [22]. Nevertheless, there are some reports that Ureaplasma urealyticum serves as a cause of persistent NGU [23,24]. For that reason, Ureaplasma urealyticum is sometimes recognized as a pathogen and sometimes as a commensal organism. Therefore, Ureaplasma infection must be considered in patients with treatment failure for NGU or patients with multiple sexual partners. If no species except Ureaplasma are detected, symptoms and leukocyte numbers in first voided urine samples are helpful for clarifying the diagnosis of Ureaplasma infection [25].",

However, NAATs, such as PCR, are useful for the identification of microorganisms that are difficult to cultivate and for those that grow slowly [25]. In another recent study in Korea, the multiplex PCR kit (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) was used to detect causative microorganisms of STI in patients with chronic prostatitis and vaginitis [27]. In multiplex PCR, more than one target sequence can be amplified by including more than one pair of primers in the reaction. Multiplex PCR has the potential to produce considerable savings of time and effort within the laboratory without compromising test utility. Furthermore, when the clinical sample amount is limited, multiplexing allows more targets to be analyzed by using a single aliquot of sample material [28]. Although there are some worries that multiplex PCR in the clinical setting may have difficulties such as poor sensi-tivity or specificity, false-negative results, and nonspecific interactions, Horii et al showed that the multiplex PCR assay had an overall sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 100% compared with uniplex PCR assays. Furthermore, there was no cross-reaction with other microorganisms [29].",
