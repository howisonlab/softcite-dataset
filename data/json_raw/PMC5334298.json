Lung cancer has been associated with exposure to indoor smoky coal emissions that contain high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; however, the pathogenesis of lung cancer has not yet been fully elucidated. Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing with lung adenocarcinoma and corresponding non-tumor tissue to explore the genomic features of Xuanwei lung cancer. We used the Molecule Annotation System to determine and plot alterations in genes and signaling pathways. Results: A total of 3 428 060 and 3 416 989 single nucleotide variants were detected in tumor and normal genomes, respectively. After comparison of these two genomes, 977 high-confidence somatic single nucleotide variants were identified. We observed a remarkably high proportion of C\u00c1G-A\u00c1T transversions. HECTD4, RCBTB2, KLF15, and CACNA1C may be cancer-related genes. Nine copy number variations increased in chromosome 5 and one in chromosome 7. The novel junctions were detected via clustered discordant paired ends and 1955 structural variants were discovered. Among these, we found 44 novel chromosome structural variations. In addition, EGFR and CACNA1C in the mitogenactivated protein kinase signaling pathway were mutated or amplified in lung adenocarcinoma tumor tissue. Conclusion: We obtained a comprehensive view of somatic alterations of Xuanwei lung adenocarcinoma. These findings provide insight into the genomic landscape in order to further learn about the progress and development of Xuanwei lung adenocarcinoma."

            "text": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide, [1][2][3] more than 40% of which were lung adenocarcinomas. Despite improvement in molecular diagnosis and targeted therapies, most tumors are only discovered at advanced stage. The overall five-year survival rate is approximately 15% worldwide, mainly because of late-stage detection and a paucity of late-stage treatments. 4 In China, lung cancer is the fastest increasing cancer and the leading cause of all cancer death since 2004. In some regions, such as Xuanwei, the incidence of lung cancer is among the highest in China and the world. 5 Recently, a retrospective sampling survey reported mortality rates of lung cancer in Xuanwei of 98.10/10 5 in men and 83.21/10 5 in women. 6 Lung cancer in Xuanwei has four remarkable characteristics: higher incidence, higher mortality, adenocarcinoma is the major histological type, and similar incidence rates between men and women. Lan et al. 7 found that the higher incidence was most likely a result of the use of smoky coal in unvented stoves in this area. Despite large-scale improvement in stoves, the lung cancer mortality rate remains very high in Xuanwei (91/10 5 compared with China's average of 31/ 10 5 in 2004-2005). We believe that other factors may contribute to the mechanisms of lung cancer development and progress in this area. Thus, the molecular study of lung cancer, especially genetic mechanisms, is of great importance.",

Studies have validated the various genomic aberrations that may act as therapeutic targets. In recent years, new molecular targeted drugs in the pharmacological treatment of adenocarcinoma have been introduced, and their effectiveness is closely dependent on the presence of specific genetic mutations in the tumor. 12 Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are one of the most relevant targets for lung cancer treatment. 13,14 To date, research of next generation sequencing has discovered most of the relevant mutations that contribute to the pathogenesis of adenocarcinoma; however, there is limited genomic data of lung adenocarcinoma in Xuanwei. Therefore, we believe that unbiased whole genome sequencing (WGS) is required to screen more mutations of lung adenocarcinoma in Xuanwei.",

            "text": "Research has shown that lung cancer is caused by the accumulation of genomic alterations. Until recently, it has been difficult to interpret these various changes within a single tumor that may work together to fulfill the hallmark traits a b  of the malignant phenotype. The development of parallel sequencing technologies has provided a powerful tool for the study of lung cancer genomes. In this paper, we conducted high-depth coverage (~80\u00d7) and detailed analysis of the whole genome sequence to a case of lung adenocarcinoma in Xuanwei. The sequencing analysis proved that data quality was high (only 5% of the total sequence was filtered out) and the reads almost completely covered the reference human genome. Our results showed that Xuanwei lung adenocarcinoma could have a large number of new mutations, ranging from the single nucleotide to chromosome alterations. We also found that some of these mutation genes participated in several well-described pathways that were known to contribute to cancer pathogenesis; however, most genes were unknown in our current understanding of the development and progression of disease. Therefore, WGS facilitated the investigation of the biological and clinical implications of such variations. In this study, the SNVs exhibited a highly distinctive pattern, showing a high proportion of C\u00c1G-A\u00c1T transversions and a low fraction of A\u00c1T-C\u00c1G transversions. Studies have indicated that C\u00c1G to A\u00c1T transversions are the most common substitution in non-small cell lung cancer associated with smoking, and our experimental results were consistent with tobacco exposure-related mutation signatures. 15,16 Non-small cell lung tumors from nonsmokers are dominated by C\u00c1G-T\u00c1A transitions compared with C\u00c1G-A\u00c1T transversions in lung tumors from smokers. Lui et al. identified that C\u00c1G-T\u00c1A transitions were decreased in a progressive manner with cumulative exposure to tobacco. 17 Interestingly, our patient was a nonsmoker who had been exposed to coal smoke for 10 years, and the C\u00c1G-T\u00c1A transitions (12%) were of relatively lower frequency compared with C\u00c1G-A\u00c1T transversions (56%), which may be associated with the coal smoke. However, our hypothesis requires further study for confirmation.",

Lower rates of mutation have been found in a transcribed strand compared with a non-transcribed strand in a small cell cancer cell line. 15 We observed a similar trend, with a pattern that would result from transcriptioncoupled DNA repair processes. In addition to commonly mutated genes, we also identified distinct mutational signatures and signaling pathways in Xuanwei lung adenocarcinoma. Some somatic SNVs and CNVs have been already reported as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the COSMIC database, including EGFR and CACNA1C. In addition, we identified 13 lung adenocarcinoma specific genes in our study. Twelve nonsynonymous somatic mutations and two mutations known to be associated with lung adenocarcinoma were identified, including two SNVs located in exon 18 and exon 20 of the EGFR gene. EGFR, a cell surface protein, binds to the epidermal growth factor. Binding of the protein to a ligandinduced receptor dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation leads to cell proliferation. 14 Both of these mutations are common in lung cancers, and both were thought to contribute to progression and development of the disease. This cancer genome had few mutated genes in the lung adenocarcinoma pathway, but showed statistically meaningful genetic changes in the MAPK signaling pathways. MAPK signaling pathways can contribute to carcinogenesis in lung adenocarcinoma.",

Our study and other studies of individual cancer genomes have shown a trend in mutations, but identification of the recurrent driver mutations will require many more samples to sequence. Nevertheless, we believe the data provides a cornerstone for such studies and enriches the analysis of Xuanwei lung adenocarcinoma in genomic variation."
