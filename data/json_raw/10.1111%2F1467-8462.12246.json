The ABS also provides two TableBuilder products, online tools for creating tables, graphs and maps using ABS microdata. These microdata files are 'licensed', as opposed to 'public use', as each organisation, and its individual staff, is required to sign relevant undertakings assuring it will abide by prescribed conditions of use (under the Census and Statistics Act 1905 (Cwlth) and the Statistics Determination 1983). Recently the ABS has expanded its microdata product suite by offering the DataLab protected research environment, which for the first time allows researchers to have unparalleled access to protected ABS datasets.",

Users are at the core of this model, which is built on the value of partnerships, shared accountability and the mutual benefits that result from researcher access to data. By carefully assessing people, projects, settings, data and output, necessary controls can be put in place to increase public value from national statistics whilst protecting privacy and confidentiality.
