            "text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of worker's compensation (WC) patients to return to work without restrictions after hip arthroscopy. Twenty-nine WC patients along with age and gender matched controls who underwent hip arthroscopy were retrospectively reviewed after achieving maximum medical improvement (MMI) status at minimum 1 year postoperatively. Patient demographic factors were evaluated, along with the Hip Outcome Score Activities of Daily Living and Sports-Specific subscales, and the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS). The majority of WC patients were able to return to work without restrictions after reaching MMI (20/29, 69.0%). WC patients who failed to return to work without restrictions had a prolonged time from injury to surgery (3.01 6 2.16 months versus 6.36 6 4.16 months; P \u00bc 0.0079), more concomitant orthopedic injuries (4/20, 20.0% versus 9/9, 100%; P \u00bc 0.0001), and higher body mass index (BMI) (26.61 6 3.52 versus 29.54 6 3.43; P \u00bc 0.047) than those who returned to work without restrictions. WC patients had significant improvement of patient-reported outcome scores following hip arthroscopy (P < 0.0001), but WC patients who returned to work without restrictions had higher scores than those who failed to do so (HOD-ADL: P < 0.0001; HOS-SS: P \u00bc 0.004; mHHS: P \u00bc 0.009). The majority of WC patients are able to return to work without restrictions when they reach MMI status following hip arthroscopy. Factors associated with failure to return to work without restrictions include prolonged time course between injury and surgical treatment, concomitant orthopaedic injuries, and a higher BMI.

            "text": "Surgical results in workers' compensation (WC) patients have been consistently associated with inferior outcomes in the orthopaedic literature when compared with non-WC patients. Harris et al. [1] performed a meta-analysis on 129 studies analysing the relationship between compensation status and outcomes, suggesting that WC patients were three times more likely to receive an inferior outcome from surgery when compared with non-WC patients. Several studies evaluating knee and shoulder outcomes in the WC population exist in the literature, but there is a paucity of information examining this patient population in the context of hip arthroscopy [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. However, Lee et al. [10] recently performed one of the larger reviews, examining 268 cases of arthroscopic labral debridement and identified workers compensation status as one of five predictors of a longer recovery time in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy.",

Although it has been shown that patients in general perform well after hip arthroscopy, the subset of WC patients may be susceptible to worse outcomes. Recently, Stake et al. [17] performed a comparative analysis between WC and control patients, showing that WC patients undergoing arthroscopic hip surgery presented with lower pre-operative patient-reported outcome scores as compared with their non-WC counterparts. However, these patients still attained significant improvement from arthroscopic hip surgery. Salvo et al. [18] returned to work an average of 6.8 months after surgery with only 58% of patients currently working at time of most recent followup. They also demonstrated that WC patients had a significantly higher Hip Outcome Score compared with controls. Gigi et al. [19] also recently showed that patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for work-related injuries with active work claims had significantly lower patient reported outcomes scores at most recent follow-up compared with patients with sports related injuries, but interestingly not significantly higher than a group of non-sports-related injuries without pending active work claims. However, the work-related injuries were again able to demonstrate significant improvements in outcomes scores compared with baseline.",

After cannulation and introduction of the arthroscope through the AL portal, the AL portal was established under direct spinal needle localization. A transverse interportal capsulotomy measuring 4 cm in length was performed from 12 to 2 o'clock about 5-8 mm from the labrum. The capsule adjacent to the acetabulum was then reflected to expose the superior acetabular rim from the indirect head of the rectus femoris insertion (12 o'clock position) laterally to the iliopsoas tendon (3 o'clock position) anteriorly. Acetabular rim trimming and labral refixation with suture anchors was then performed as appropriate [29] using a distal anterolateral accessory (DALA) portal. Next, the traction was released and the hip was flexed roughly 30 . A T-capsulotomy was then performed using an arthroscopic scalpel through a 5.0-mm cannula in the DALA portal at the interval between the iliocapsularis and the gluteus minimus. The T-capsulotomy was performed perpendicular to the prior transverse capsulotomy along the length of the femoral neck distally to the capsular reflection at the intertrochanteric line in order to access the femoral head-neck junction in the peripheral compartment. All indicated procedures, including femoral osteochondroplasty between 12 and 6 o'clock, were then performed and the hip was taken through a dynamic fluoroscopic examination. The capsule then was closed arthroscopically and the portals were approximated in a layered fashion.",

            "text": "This study examines the ability of WC patients to return to work without restrictions after reaching MMI following hip arthroscopy and factors associated with failure to return to work without restrictions. We find that the majority (69.0%) of WC patients are able to return to work without restrictions after reaching MMI a minimum of 1-year following hip arthroscopy. The patients who were unable to  return to work without restrictions had higher BMI, higher rate of concurrent orthopaedic injuries, and longer time from injury to surgery. WC patients exhibit significant improvement in patient reported outcomes regardless of ability to return to work without restrictions, but scores remained lower than age and gender matched controls. The results of this study not only provide clinicians valuable information on the results of hip arthroscopy in WC patients compared with matched controls, but also identifies factors associated with failure to return to work without restrictions. WC status has been associated with inferior outcomes after orthopedic surgery in general and specifically for hip arthroscopy as well [1,10,31]. Potter et al. [3] followed a military cohort receiving arthroscopic acetabular labral debridement and showed that patients with disability status exhibited significantly lower post-operative mean mHHS (P < 0.0001), lower Short Form-36 subscale scores (P < 0.02), and lower satisfaction rates (P < 0.04) as compared with non-disability patients. Conversely, Byrd showed that successful outcomes could be achieved in a small number of workers' compensation patients undergoing hip arthroscopy, finding no significant differences in the Harris Hip Scale between WC patients and non-WC patients [32] Stake et al. [17] performed a case-control study and found that workers' compensation patients had lower pre-and post-operative patient-reported outcome scores than their non-WC counterparts, but experienced the same magnitude of improvement in outcome scores with surgery. Comparable outcomes have been achieved in shoulder surgery for WC patients. Nicholson studied a cohort of 40 WC patients undergoing arthroscopic acromioplasty and found that post-operative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (ASES), Simple Shoulder Test scores (SST) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores were not significantly different as compared with non-WC patients [9]. However, WC patients had a significantly longer average time period prior to returning to full-duty work (P \u00bc 0.0001) [9]. Bhatia et al. [27] found that 88.5% in a cohort of 69 WC patients returned to their preoperative level of work at a mean time to MMI of 7.6 months after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. These patients demonstrated improved outcomes using validated scoring scales at the time of follow-up, but outcomes remained inferior to non-WC patients as compared with a historical control group [27]. Cuff et al. [6] also found significantly lower ASES scores, SST scores, and VAS pain scores in a cohort of 50 WC patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair as compared with non-WC patients (P < 0.0001). Interestingly, this study also stratified and analysed WC patients based on differential outcomes, showing that those who were compliant with the prescribed post-operative rehabilitation protocol performed better on the ASES, SST and VAS pain score as compared with non-compliant patients (P < 0.0001) at follow-up [6]. These results reinforce the findings presented in our study, emphasizing that a spectrum of outcomes exist within the WC population.",

Nevertheless, we found that WC patients had significantly improved outcome scores following hip arthroscopy regardless of ability to return to work without restrictions. Even though WC patients started at lower baseline outcome scores and ended up having lower post-operative outcome scores, their magnitude of improvement was similar to the matched-controls. This may indicate that since WC patients start at a lower baseline, the expectations regarding their ultimate outcomes would need to be adjusted accordingly.",

BMI has been shown in other studies to be an independent predictor of post-operative complications and inferior clinical outcomes. Gupta et al. [33] performed a retrospective review of 119 primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasties and determined that BMI was the only significant determinant of overall complication rates and medical complication rates (P < 0.05). Similar conclusions  have been found in studies on total shoulder arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty [34][35][36][37][38]. Although the limited evidence exploring obesity in hip arthroscopy has not suggested significant impact on outcomes, Collins et al. argued that obesity significantly increases the risk of post-operative complications such as deep venous thrombosis and worsened hip pain [38,39]. The potential interaction of a higher BMI in an already vulnerable group, such as WC patients, may represent an additional barrier to satisfactory outcomes. Identification of these patients preoperatively may be of benefit to the surgeon, allowing them to either adjust the expectations of the patient or to potentially apply weight loss interventions before surgery if appropriate.",

The reason for association of longer time from injury to surgery with failure to return to work without restrictions is not clear, but could potentially relate to deconditioning from longer timeframe of hip pain and dysfunction. Additionally, patients with associated injuries might have undergone workup and treatment for these injuries prior to addressing their hip pathology, which would represent a confounding variable. The WC patients who failed to return to work without restrictions had a 100% rate of concurrent orthopaedic conditions, as opposed to 20% in the patients who returned to work without restrictions. In addition to a slowed recovery from hip arthroscopy, the management of these injuries may actually potentiate the pain experienced in the hip. The presence of associated injuries should alert the surgeon to adjust expectations for the patient, informing them of a potentially slower recovery period.",

The findings based on this case mix may therefore not be generalizable. Differing worker's compensation (WC) regulations in different states may affect outcomes as well and may be confounded by conflicting issues such as potential secondary gain. Additionally, the study is retrospective in nature using a prospectively collected database and may potentially be underpowered as there were a limited number of eligible WC patients that met our inclusion criteria to be included in the analysis. Our sample size only allowed for matching on a limited number of variables, potentially not taking into account other important confounding variables. The patients' psychological state was also another potential contributor to patient outcomes that was not explored in the current study. The addition of an outcomes survey with a psychological component such as the SF-12 or SF-36 would have been able to examine this component. Patients had follow-up for at a minimum of 1-year post-operative and until they obtained MMI status. This timeframe is relevant for treatment of a WC patient population regarding ability to return to work without restrictions and short-term patient reported outcomes, but longer followup would also provide valuable information about the durability of hip arthroscopy results in the WC patient population.",
