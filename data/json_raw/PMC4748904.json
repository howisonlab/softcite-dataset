However, other meta-analyses have found SES to be superior to PES. Therefore, to solve this issue, we aim to compare the clinical outcomes between SES and PES during a follow-up period of about 1 or more years. We have searched Medline and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SES with PES. These RCTs have been carefully analyzed and then different types of ST including ST defined by the Academic Research Consortium (ARC), acute ST, late and very late ST have all been considered as the clinical endpoints in this study. A follow-up period of about 1 year, between 1 and 2 years as well as a longer follow-up period between 1 and 5 years have been considered. Data were retrieved and combined by means of a fixed-effect model because of a lower heterogeneity observed among the results. Odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and the pooled analyses were performed with RevMan 5.3 software. Twenty-nine studies from 19 RCTs comprising of 16,724 patients (8115 patients in the SES group and 8609 patients in the PES group) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. No significant differences in ST have been observed between SES and",

A similar result was reported in another meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 1183 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 2 The result from the meta-analysis conducted by Zhang et al 3 in 2010 also showed no significant difference in ST among the 1173 patients analyzed. Moreover, the meta-analysis conducted by Kastrati et al 4 in 2005 including 3669 patients also showed a similar rate of ST between SES and PES in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

The Cochrane Q-statistic and the I2-statistic tests were used to assess heterogeneity among the studies whereby P 0.05 was considered statistically significant and P > 0.05 was considered statistically insignificant. I2 described the total variation (due to heterogeneity rather than chance) across studies in terms of percentages whereby a value of 0% indicated no heterogeneity, and larger values especially from 50% and above indicated increasing heterogeneity. A fixed effect model was used if I2 was <50% and a random effect model was used if I2 was >50%. Funnel plots were assessed for publication bias. Odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for categorical variables. RevMan 5.3 software was used for the statistical analysis. The authors had full access to and take full responsibility for the integrity of the data. All authors have read and agreed to the manuscript as written. Ethical approval was not required since this study is a systematic review and metaanalysis of RCTs. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of study selection.

However, it is a fact that most of the drugs which are currently approved to coat stents used in coronary angioplasty do not differentiate or simply do not recognize the difference between proliferative vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). 37 The specification of these antiproliferative drugs which is normally very important, is often lacking and therefore, the proliferation and migration of VSMCs and ECs in the vessel are affected. These antiproliferative drugs also cause the inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia and they also severely affect the endothelial regeneration which is very important for the healing of these injured vessels and finally resulting in an incomplete reendothelialization. Because of this insufficient reendothelialization, late/long-term ST often manifests. [38][39] Moreover, p27 is a component expressed by arteries. When arteries are injured, p27 is rapidly downregulated due to mechanisms initiated by activated VSMC triggering intimal hyperplasia which then results in arterial restenosis. Overexpression of exogenous p27 in VSMC results in mechanisms that led to the significant reduction in neointimal formation. Studies have shown sirolimus, which is the coating material of certain DES, would inhibit the breakdown of p27, as well as induce the increased production of p27 thus preventing the proliferation and migration of VSMC and could therefore inhibit reendothelialization of vessels by this way. [40][41] Also, overexpression of p27 without sparring ECs could prevent the normal physiological function of the injured blood vessels and this could further increase the risk of late ST among the several DES.",

Hence, incorporating the microRNA-based strategy in stents could increase the overexpression of p27 and at the same time protect ECs thus reducing ST in those patients treated with DES after PCI. Further studies should be conducted to confirm the effect of this microRNA-based strategy to make sure whether it truly protects ECs. 42 This will be a revolution in the field of Interventional Cardiology.",

Most of the RCTs had a follow-up period of at least 1 year; however, several other RCTs had a follow-up period of less or more than 1 year. Therefore, combing different follow-up periods that are almost of the same length, but not exactly the same, could affect the results in one way or the other. Moreover, our study included patients from different categories of diseases. For example, a few studies were conducted on the general population suffering from CAD; however, other studies were conducted on patients with long coronary lesions, ST elevated myocardial infarction or on patients suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus.
