            "text": "Nanostructured metals achieve extraordinary strength but suffer from low thermal stability, both a consequence of a high fraction of interfaces. Overcoming this tradeoff relies on making the interfaces themselves thermally stable. Here we show that the atomic structures of bi-metal interfaces in macroscale nanomaterials suitable for engineering structures can be significantly altered via changing the severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing pathway. Two types of interfaces are formed, both exhibiting a regular atomic structure and providing for excellent thermal stability, up to more than half the melting temperature of one of the constituents. Most importantly, the thermal stability of one is found to be significantly better than the other, indicating the exciting potential to control and optimize macroscale robustness via atomic-scale bimetal interface tuning. Taken together, these results demonstrate an innovative way to engineer pristine bimetal interfaces for a new class of simultaneously strong and thermally stable materials."

Nanocrystalline metals produced by top-down process, such as SPD, have high strength and are in bulk form, but they are thermally unstable even at slightly above room temperatures 13,14 . These mechanical methods produce nanocrystalline metals that contain a high density of crystallographically disordered, non-equilibrium grain boundaries (interfaces), which with minimal thermal stimulus promote grain coarsening [15][16][17] .

Prior work on PVD foils 23 has shown that highly ordered bimetal interfaces are much more robust against thermally-induced instabilities than ordinary grain boundaries. Accordingly, by virtue of the pristine interfaces induced in the SPD process, the SPD composites have proven remarkably strong 24 , thermally stable 21 , and radiation resistant 25 .

ARB material was made by maintaining the rolling direction in each step until individual Cu and Nb layer thicknesses (h) were reduced to 58 nm. As demonstrated in figure 1a, to synthesize the ARB-LR (longitudinally rolled) material with 20 nm average individual layer thickness, we continued to roll the h 5 58 nm ARB material while preserving the same rolling direction as used from the start of the process. In contrast, the ARB-CR (cross-rolled) material with 20 nm individual layer thickness was produced by rolling the 58 nm ARB material with a new rolling direction rotated 90u in-plane as shown in figure 1d. The two ARB materials experienced the same final total strain of 11.51. Using neutron diffraction, we found that the two processing pathways generate two completely different textures. The measured textures for the 20 nm composites are presented in the form of inverse pole figures (IPFs) in the rolling direction (RD), transverse direction (TD) and normal direction (ND) of the processed sheet. As an indication of their stability, the same textures are generated at 30 nm ARB-LR and 30 nm ARB-CR textures, respectively (supplementary figure 1). Analysis of these textures reveals that both deviate from conventional single phase Cu and Nb rolling textures 27 . In figure 1b, the 20 nm ARB-LR material contains a predominant {112},111. Cujj{112},110.Nb texture (where the crystal planes and directions are written parallel to the {rolling plane}-,rolling direction.), which is consistent with the texture of 58 nm ARB-LR material (Supplementary figure 2). Additionally, the minor texture component {551},1 1 10. of the Cu phase is due to interface-facilitated Cu twinning, which initiates when the individual layer thickness reduces below 50 nm 21,[27][28][29] . The change in processing pathway induced a completely different texture, as seen in figure 1e. Mean-field crystal plasticity simulations of the cross-rolling successfully predicted these textures, suggesting that this abrupt alteration is accommodated solely by crystallographic slip (see supplement and supplementary figure 3). Remarkably, the Cu and Nb textures of the ARB-CR material are exceptionally sharp (figure 1e), suggesting a preferential interface character of {110},111.Cujj{001},110.Nb. The stable and prevailing interfaces suggested by the texture in the ARB-LR and ARB-CR samples are illustrated in figures 1c and 1f.",

For all layers in both the ARB-LR (figure 2a) and ARB-CR (figure 2b) materials, only one crystal spanned the distance between two adjacent interfaces. Another notable feature of both materials is the planarity of the Cu-Nb interfaces and the regularity of layer thicknesses. Thus, changing the processing pathway on the nanomaterial to make the ARB-CR nanomaterial preserved the lamellar architecture without roughening or breaking up the layers. The TEM analysis also revealed that unlike the ARB-CR material, the ARB-LR material contains many deformation twins in the Cu layers (figure 2a), which leads to its distinct texture development, as mentioned above. Twinning occurs in the ARB-LR sample because its interfaces and grain orientations favor it, whereas those in the ARB-CR sample do not 29,30 .",

These prevailing interfaces are illustrated in figures 1c and 1f. The orientation relationships of these two interfaces are Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) and Nishiyama-Wasserman (N-W), respectively. Unlike the familiar K-S and N-W fcc/bcc interfaces that arise from thermodynamic processes 24 whose interface planes correspond to the closest packed planes, the {111}Cu and {110}Nb planes, the mechanically driven interfaces emerging in these samples join the fcc and bcc crystals at different interface planes, namely the {112}Cujj{112}Nb and {110}Cujj{001}Nb planes. Most intriguingly, both interfaces are found by HRTEM to be atomically ordered. While the former {112}Cujj{112}Nb K-S interface is comprised of a regular array of facets, the latter {110}Cujj{001}Nb N-W interface is atomically flat. Recent fundamental studies have shown that this difference profoundly affects the ability of the interface to act as a source for dislocations and deformation twins 29,31,32 , the two main carriers of plastic deformation.

Comparing the variation of hardness and average layer thickness reveals a significant dependence of strength on length scale. After annealing at 600uC for one hour, the average layer thickness of the ARB-LR materials doubled while the ARB-CR material only increased by 5%. In repeating the experimental analysis for higher temperatures, we find that the threshold of thermal stability for the ARB-CR material lies between 600uC and 700uC for one hour annealing (supplementary figures 4 h and 5 h).",

Remarkably, both interfaces after heating at 600uC were stable. Specifically many important structural properties, including the atomic scale features of facets or flatness, the chemical sharpness, and crystallography, were maintained. Second, in light of earlier reports that intra-layer grain boundaries are relatively unstable 23 , we considered possible differences in their grain boundary density. Using a unique, high-resolution ''wedge-mounting'' electron backscatter diffraction (WM-EBSD) 34 , we were able to correlate grain boundary density to the statistical distribution of grain sizes in the two in-plane directions, the TD and the RD. To ensure statistically significant and representative data, we confirmed that the textures from the WM-EBSD technique are consistent with those from neutron diffraction (supplementary figure 6).",

For the 58 nm ARB-LR material, on average the grains are shaped like ''planks'' with RD:ND:TD ratios of 335157 and 8351516 in the Cu and Nb, respectively. The analysis is repeated for the h 5 30 nm ARB-LR and ARB-CR samples since the h 5 20 nm materials are too fine for the WM-EBSD technique. However, it is reasonable to deduce that the trends in aspect ratios in the h 5 30 nm are consistent with those in the h 5 20 nm materials. The results show that the basic grain shapes in the h 5 58 nm are maintained in the h 5 30 nm ARB-LR material. In contrast, for the 30 nm ARB-CR material, we find 'pancake-shaped' grains, where the average length of the grains in the original RD has not changed, but the average length in the original TD has increased three-fold. Due to the extremely large aspect ratios, we conclude that the grain boundary fraction in both materials is exceedingly small. In the ARB-CR material this fraction is even smaller compared to the ARB-LR material. Evidently, the differences of grain boundary fraction seen in figure 4 lead to important differences in their thermal stabilities seen in figure 3. This suggests that controlled SPD processing is a profitable way to improve thermal stability of materials by simultaneously increasing the stable interface fraction and decreasing unstable grain boundary fraction."

All the sheets were 20 cm long and 6.5 cm wide. After a five-minute ultrasonic acetone bath followed by wire brushing to facilitate bonding, the Cu and Nb sheets were stacked in a sandwich-like structure (Cu-Nb-Cu) for the first roll-bonding step. A 2-high rolling mill (Waterbury-Farrel, Brampton, Ontario, Canada) was used in this roll-bonding step with an approximate 60% reduction in thickness. Following each roll-bonding step, a repeating sequence of halving, cleaning, restacking, and roll bonding was performed until the average layer thickness was 200 nm. From 200 nm, the samples were only subjected to conventional rolling with a 10% decrease in total sample thickness per rolling step. After individual Cu and Nb layer thicknesses were reduced to 58 nm, the material was cut into two pieces. One piece was rolled in the same rolling direction as used from the start of the process until the individual layer thickness reduced to 20 nm (ARB-LR). The other piece was rotated 90u in-plane and rolled in the new rolling direction to get the ARB-CR material with individual layer thickness of 20 nm. The whole ARB process was carried out at room temperature."
