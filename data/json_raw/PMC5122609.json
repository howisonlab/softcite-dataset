As people with dementia are particularly vulnerable to the effects of drugs, it is especially important to evaluate the dosages of renally cleared medications in this group. Objective The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of impaired renal function and inappropriate prescriptions on the basis of renal function among older patients with dementia or cognitive impairment. Methods The medical records of 428 patients aged C65 years who were admitted to two hospitals in northern Sweden were reviewed and renally cleared medications were identified. The Cockcroft-Gault equation was used to evaluate renal function. Doses were evaluated according to the Geriatric Dosage Handbook. Results Renal function was impaired (estimated glomerular filtration rate \\60 ml/min) in 65.4 % of the study population. Impaired renal function was associated with increasing age. Among 547 prescriptions identified as renally cleared medications, 9.1 % were inappropriate based on the patient's renal function; 13.5 % of the 326 patients prescribed renally cleared medications had inappropriate prescriptions. Inappropriate prescriptions were more common among patients living in nursing homes. Conclusions Impaired renal function is common and inappropriate prescription is prevalent among old people with cognitive impairment in northern Sweden. Continuous consideration of renal function is important when prescribing medications to this group.",

            "text": "Age-related physiological changes affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of a drug, and the elimination of drugs is particularly affected by impairment of renal function [1,2]. Renal mass declines with age as do the number and size of nephrons [6], and this process results in reduced glomerular and tubular filtration [2]. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\60 ml/min, is a common and growing problem in older populations [6][7][8]. Renally excreted drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, such as digoxin and lithium, can accumulate and concentrations can become toxic [9]. Drugs such as morphine and glibenclamide that have active metabolites may cause ADRs [10,11]. Estimation of renal function is thus important when prescribing renally excreted drugs to older people to avoid inappropriate prescribing, which is defined as ''a situation where risk from the adverse effects of a prescribed medication outweighs the desired clinical benefits of treating a particular condition'' [4].",

            "text": "eGFR is increasingly used in healthcare to estimate patients' renal function. The use of serum creatinine level alone as a measure of renal function is not reliable [12] because creatinine production, which is dependent on muscle mass, decreases with age; thus, the use of serum creatinine level alone leads to overestimation of renal function [1,6]. Two commonly used methods for calculating eGFR on the basis of serum creatinine level are the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation [2,13]. The CG equation calculates the absolute eGFR (ml/ min) [14]. Most recommendations published in dosage handbooks are based on renal function estimated by the CG equation [2,6]. The CKD-EPI equation calculates the relative eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) and is used to detect and characterise CKD [13][14][15]. Estimates of renal function obtained via creatinine-based equations are less accurate in certain patients such as those who are malnourished, amputees and the morbidly obese [2,12]. Debate concerning the most suitable equation for calculating eGFR is ongoing [6,13,16,17].",

All admissions were emergencies, except for one that was elective. The most common reasons for admission were fractures/falls, heart failure or pneumonia. A total of 460 people were randomised to the intervention and control groups. Eligible patients were those aged C65 years who had dementia or cognitive impairment. Dementia diagnoses were collected from medical records. Patients were considered to have cognitive impairment if sufficient information related to memory, orientation or executive function was noted in their medical records prior to the index hospitalization. In addition, patients in whom dementia was suspected and medical investigation had been or would be commenced were included. Ambiguous or uncertain cases were excluded. The procedure described was chosen to avoid the risk of including people without dementia who had developed a delirious or confused state during the hospital stay (Gustafsson M et al., 2016, unpublished observations). Each patient in the intervention group received an additional medication review by a clinical pharmacist, while the control group received standard care.",

The reported prevalence of impaired renal function among older people ranges from 12 to 66 % [15,17,27]. The wide variation in this parameter may be due to differences in study setting, individual parameters and the estimation equations used. The association between impaired renal function and advancing age found in the present study was expected and has been reported in several other studies [8,19,28,29]. The rate of decline in renal function has been found to be greater in people with concomitant diseases; diabetes, for example, is one of the most common diseases associated with impaired renal function [30,31]. In this study, no significant difference was seen between people with and without impaired renal function regarding degree of cognitive impairment. A similar result was seen in another study [27], which found no association between CKD and cognitive decline or the incidence of all-cause dementia. As the prevalence of impaired renal function in this group was high, and as impairment is often under-recognised among older people, routine monitoring to detect deteriorating renal function is important to avoid the consequences of inappropriate prescriptions [8].",

            "text": "In the present study, close to 10 % of the identified prescriptions were inappropriate when the CG equation was used to estimate renal function; one-third of these prescriptions had excessive doses given the patient's renal function and two-thirds were contraindicated. When the CKD-EPI equation was used, the prevalence of inappropriate prescriptions was between 5 and 6 %. These prevalence figures differ from those reported in previous studies of drug prescriptions that were inappropriate given impaired renal function. In one study of patients aged C70 years, 42.2 % of identified prescriptions had doses exceeding current guidelines [21]. Another study found 13 % of prescriptions to be potentially inappropriate [18], similar to our results. While the chosen renal function estimation method might have affected the end result, we also found that the CKD-EPI equation overestimates and the CG equation underestimates renal function, which may explain the differences in prevalence seen in the present study [13,15,16]. Differences in the reported prevalence of inappropriate prescriptions may also be because prescribers and researchers use different prescribing or dosage guidelines [4,6,8,[18][19][20][21]. For example, recommendations on dosage limits for metformin differ between guidelines [23,26,32]. In the present study, the majority of contraindicated prescriptions were for metformin, probably because it is commonly prescribed and considered contraindicated for patients with an eGFR \\ 60 ml/min, according to the GDH [23]. Other guidelines continue to recommend low-dose metformin in patients with eGFRs [ 30 ml/min, which would alter the prevalence of     inappropriate prescription of this drug [26]. When metformin was excluded from the analysis, the prevalence of inappropriate prescription was 7.4 %. Metformin is considered the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus, and monitoring of renal function is essential to avoid lactic acidosis in patients receiving this drug [26,32]. In addition to metformin and allopurinol, we also documented more than one inappropriate prescription each for alendronate, glibenclamide, hydrochlorothiazide, memantine, morphine, nitrofurantoin and spironolactone. In other studies, the most frequently inappropriately prescribed drugs were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, atenolol, gabapentin, glyburide, ranitidine and nitrofurantoin [6,8]. Glibenclamide has been associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia compared with other sulfonylureas, and other drugs in this class should be used for patients with impaired renal function [23,32]. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated because impaired renal function decreases its efficacy [23]. In general, patients with dementia or cognitive impairment are especially vulnerable to ADRs, and it  is essential to avoid adverse reactions [33]. Hypoglycaemia as an adverse reaction to glibenclamide or worsening symptoms of urinary infection due to decreased nitrofurantoin efficacy may have particularly harmful consequences in this group. Older people with dementia are, on average, prescribed more medicines than older people without dementia [34]. This means it is even more important and urgent to evaluate prescriptions of renally excreted drugs to ensure that the correct doses are used and further ADRs are avoided. In this study, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age, sex and living in a nursing home were not significantly associated with the record of one or more potentially inappropriate prescription. In contrast, other studies have found that inappropriate prescription in relation to renal function is more common in older people and among those living in nursing homes [6,22]. Our univariate model showed that living situation was associated with inappropriate prescription, but this association was not significant in the multivariable model. People who live in nursing homes may be older and have more concomitant diseases that affect renal function than older people living at home.",

Therefore, we could not determine whether patients' GFRs were stable because we analysed only one serum creatinine level measurement per patient [12]. Also, no other markers of kidney damage were collected. Only one patient was admitted to the acute internal medicine ward because of acute kidney injury (AKI), but more people could possibly have suffered from AKI even if the admission was classified otherwise. Serum creatinine level was recorded on the date of randomisation, which may have differed slightly from the date of hospital admission-from which the medication prescription data were taken. Actual body weight was also used for all patients, regardless of body composition, which may have affected eGFR values for patients with unusual muscle mass. Pro re nata drugs were not included in the analysis, which may have led to underestimation of the prevalence of inappropriate prescription; for example, pro re nata doses of morphine are often prescribed. Dosage guidelines may differ between different dosage references. The GDH was chosen because of its international application and because it specifically addresses recommended doses for older people. However, the ranges for renal function were quite narrow for some of the drug dosage guidelines, which may have led to significant confounding in the present study. The cross-sectional design of the study, which involved assessment of patients' prescriptions at the time of the medication record review, means we cannot comment on the appropriateness of medications when they were initially prescribed. Height data were lacking for six patients, which affected the absolute eGFR values calculated from the relative GFRs estimated using the CKD-EPI equation. MMSE test results were available for only 155 patients in the sample.",

Data such as serum creatinine level, weight and prescribed medications were current. The CG equation was used to estimate renal function for the purpose of estimating dosages in a medical care setting at the time the study was conducted [2]. However, only serum creatinine was reported in the medical records and prescribers then had to calculate the eGFR themselves. Subsequent to completion of the study, the CKD-EPI equation has become the current standard method used to calculate the eGFR in medical records. The results thus provide a representative picture of clinical reality at the time of the study [6,17,23,25].",
