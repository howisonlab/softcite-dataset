This study examined (1) correlations between depression and HRV indices; (2) group differences in HRV indices among a heroin-user group, a group with major depressive disorder but no heroin use, and healthy controls; and (3) the effects of heart-rate-variability-biofeedback on depressive symptoms, HRV indices, and respiratory rates within the heroin group. Methods: All participants completed a depression questionnaire and underwent electrocardiogram measurements, and group differences in baseline HRV indices were examined. The heroin group underwent electrocardiogram and respiration rate measurements at baseline, during a depressive condition, and during a happiness condition, before and after which they took part in the heart-rate-variability-biofeedback program. The effects of heart-rate-variability-biofeedback on depressive symptoms, HRV indices, and respiration rates were examined. Results: There was a negative correlation between depression and high frequency of HRV, and a positive correlation between depression and low frequency to high frequency ratio of HRV. The heroin group had a lower overall and high frequency of HRV, and a higher low frequency/high frequency ratio than healthy controls. The heart-rate-variability-biofeedback intervention increased HRV indices and decreased respiratory rates from pre-intervention to post-intervention. Conclusion: Reduced parasympathetic and increased sympathetic activations were found in heroin users. Heart-rate-variabilitybiofeedback was an effective non-pharmacological intervention to restore autonomic balance."

            "text": "The prevalence of heroin use has increased in recent years. [1][2][3] Heroin use can cause significant psychosocial problems such as unemployment and criminal activity, as well as compromising the user's functioning. 4) A high proportion of heroin users have comorbid psychiatric disorders. 1) The prevalence of major depressive episodes among heroin users has been found to be 25% to 26%. 1,5) Comorbidity with depression compromises the heroin user's prognosis, increasing the risk of relapsing into heroin use, and suicide. 6) Previous neurobiological research has found that heroin use may damage the user's limbic system and locus ceruleus, which causes neurotransmitter changes. 7) However, few studies have explored the relationships between psychophysiological responses and heroin use. Heroin withdrawal may accompany physiological responses, such as restlessness, cold sweats, cold flashes, goose bumps, an increased heart rate, an elevated temperature, an elevated pulse, a sharp elevation in blood pressure, sweating, shallow breathing, insomnia, muscle and bone pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. 8,9) Most of these heroin withdrawal symptoms involve increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation, decreased parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activation, and/or decreased cardiac vagal activity. 10) A meta-analysis of the cue-reactivity paradigm found that an increased heart rate, an increase in sweat gland activity, and a decreased skin temperature were the key physiological indicators of a craving for an addictive substance. 11) Yu et al. 12) also found that heroin-related imagery scripts and paraphernalia were able to induce cravings and changes in cardiovascular function, including an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and an increased heart rate.",

            "text": "The results of the previous studies described above indicate the importance of studying heart rate variability (HRV) among heroin users. HRV measures the variation in heart beat intervals, which is influenced by SNS and PNS input to the sino-atrial node of the heart. 13) Increased PNS activation (or vagal activity) increases HRV, while increased SNS activation (or sympatho-vagal imbalance) decreases HRV. 14) Regarding the interpretation of HRV indices, standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) and total power of HRV are indicated the overall HRV, low frequency (LF) is most likely affected both by cardiac SNS and PNS, and high frequency (HF) is an index of PNS activation. 13,14) HRV is related to an individual's overall physical condition 15,16) and/or his or her mental health. [17][18][19] Reduced HRV has been found in heroin users 10) and patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). 2,20) Lower SDNN and HF indices have been found to be related to emotional dysregulation and social disability among patients with MDD. [21][22][23] Compared with healthy controls, recently relapsed heroin users show lower heart rate variance, reduced total power, and a lower HF HRV. 10) However, few studies have examined the difference in HRV indices between heroin users with depressive symptoms and patients with MDD. Previous studies have found that methadone maintenance therapy is able to affect the HF index among heroin users, 10,24) and bring about an increase in total power and the LF index among heroin users with borderline and other personality patterns. 24) However, the effects of a non-pharmacological intervention model, such as HRVbiofeedback (HRV-BF), on HRV indices in heroin users has not been examined in detail. The protocol of HRV-BF was first described by Lehrer et al. 25) Its aim is to increase respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) amplitude by breathing at the resonance frequency, which is approximately 0.1 Hz or six breaths per minute. 26) Lin et al. 27) modified Lehrer et al.'s 25) HRV-BF protocol and successfully applied it to patients with coronary artery disease and MDD in Taiwanese populations. 27,28) Lin et al.'s 27) HRV-BF protocol followed the Lehrer et al.'s 25) protocol by determining the individual's resonance frequency in the first session, and then adjusting the respiration rate during the HRV-BF training by gradually stepping down to reach the participant's resonance frequency, by asking participants to breathe slowly and regularly. 27) Breathing at the resonance frequency has been found to cause resonance in the cardiovascular system, thereby increasing HRV and inducing a baroreflex gain. 16) Research has confirmed the effects of HRV-BF with respect to increasing cardiac vagal activity among patients with cardiovascular disease 15,29) and with respect to decreasing depressive symptoms among patients with MDD. 17) However, the effects of HRV-BF in increasing HRV indices and decreasing depressive symptoms among heroin users still needs to be explored.",

This result is consistent with the findings of Agelink et al., 32) and indicates that PNS withdrawal occurs in patients with MDD. The polyvagal theory 33) emphasizes the role of cardiovascular physiology in social behavior whereby the vagal brake regulates sympathetic activation. Individuals with substance addiction may use addictive drugs to reduce this negative effect or to modulate interpersonal conflicts. As a result, continued drug addiction may impair the vagal activity of drug users. 34,35) Regarding the effects of HRV-BF on HRV indices in heroin users, we found a significant increase in HRV indices from pre-to post-intervention, especially for SDNN, LF, and HF under recovery from depression, and HF under baseline and depressive induction. The increased SDNN and LF are consistent with the results of a previous study on the effects of HRV-BF among patients with MDD. 17,28) The effects of HRV-BF with respect to increasing HF observed in this study are also consistent with findings in patients with coronary artery disease. 36,37) The present study found that heroin users slowed their respiration rates from 18.60 to 13.17 breaths per minute after HRV-BF intervention. Slowing down the respiration rate is known to result in a significant increase in PNS activation. 23) The findings of this study support the hypothesis that HRV-BF is an effective non-pharmacological intervention that restores parasympathetic activation among heroin users.",

This result is consistent with a prior study wherein heroin users had a greater emotional response to neutral images than to pleasant images. 38) It is possible that this effect in heroin users is related to both impaired negative emotional processing 39) and to the compromising effect of heroin on the brain, such as an effect on amygdala activity. 40) Consequently, it may be difficult for heroin users to experience a positive emotion. The amygdala is thought to play an important role in processing anxiety and depression related to drug dependence via negative reinforcement. 40) This may explain why we were unable to find a significant improvement in HRV indices for happiness induction and happiness recovery, comparing pre-to post-intervention. Overall, heroin users have the difficulty to experience the positive emotion may relate to a reduction in PNS inhibition of SNS activity, blocking vagal inhibitory processes and baroreflex feedback.",

Although we screened 90 addicts from 354 clients whose depression total score exceeded 13, only nine heroin users participated and completed the 6-week HRV-BF. Numerous reasons may have limited participation in this study, such as the participant not using heroin, having a routine activity or other treatment program that was a contraindication for study participation, moving to another jail such that they could not complete the 6-week program, and a lack of motivation to participate in the study. Second, the diag-nosis of MDD was not confirmed by psychiatrists. Only one heroin user reported a previous MDD diagnosis by psychiatrist and a prior prescription for antidepressants. Third, there was no control group in Study 2, which limits the interpretation of the effects of HRV-BF."
