            "text": "Background: EGFR expression and pathway activation are common in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, anti-EGFR therapies have not been effective in these patients. We aimed to study the efficacy of targeting MET in overcoming resistance to EGFR therapy in TNBC cell lines. Methods: TNBC lines (MDA-MB-468, HCC-1395, and MDA-MB-231), and a hormone receptor-positive breast cancer line (T47D) were stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Lines were then treated with different concentrations of EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib or cetuximab), with or without a MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EMD 1214063). Proliferation was measured by MTS assay, in soft agar and with a matrigel assay. Synergy was measured with Calcusyn. Protein expression and signaling were examined with immunoblotting. Results: There was activation of ligand-receptor-downstream signaling pathways in MDA-MB-468 and HCC-1395 upon stimulation with EGF and HGF. In these cell lines, we observed synergism when combining EGFR and MET inhibitors. These results were observed across assays. In western blotting, combination therapy resulted in abrogation of pAKT and pMAPK while monotherapy did not. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that dual EGFR/MET inhibition is synergistic in TNBC. Targeting both EGFR and MET receptors may provide an effective therapeutic strategy in TNBC."

In western blotting, both gefitinib and cetuximab reduced pEGFR and EMD1214063 abrogated pMET, respectively in MDA-MB-468 as well as in HCC-1395. Either drug alone was insufficient to alter pAKT, pMAPK and pS6 levels. Strikingly, however the combination of these two drugs significantly reduced or abrogated the expression of downstream signaling molecules. These results suggest that each inhibitor has effects on their respective direct targets but that these effects are not translated into blocking of survival and proliferative pathways. However, the combination of EGFR and MET inhibition could abrogate the activation of essential molecules required for cell growth control. Interestingly, in MDA-MB-231 and T47D, there were no effects on PI3K or MAPK signaling not only after the single agent therapy but also even after combination treatment (Fig. 4). Next, we checked if we could reverse the inhibition of these drugs on downstream molecules when we transfect either AKT or MEK into the cells. As shown in Figure 5, transfection of wild type AKT and/or wild type MEK into MDA-MB-468 cells increased pAKT and pMEK respectively (Fig 5). Surprisingly, in transfected cells, the combination of EGFR or MET inhibition failed to decrease pAKT in AKT transfected cells and pMEK in MEK transfected cells. This effect was also seen when AKT and MEK were cotransfected (Fig. 5).",

MDA-MB-468 and HCC-1395 were responsive to both EGF and HGF stimulation consistent with the presence of functional cell surface receptors able to link to downstream signals including pMAPK and pAKT. However, MDA-MB-231 and T47D showed faint or negligible expression of pEGFR and pMET even after stimulation with growth factors and there were little changes in levels of downstream targets including pMAPK and pAKT (Fig. 6). Accordingly, we designated MDA-MB-468 and HCC-1395 as cell lines that have active EGFR and MET pathways and MDA-MB-231 and T47D as cell lines with inactive EGFR and MET pathways. These results are consistent with MDA-MB-468 and HCC-1395 responding to gefitinib and EMD 121463 and with MDA-MB-231 and T47D not responding or poorly responding.",

Constitutively activating mutations like EGFR in non-small cell lung cancer or V600K BRAF mutations in melanoma are rarely found in breast cancer [5,16,17] . In terms of MET, ligand-independent MET activation, by mutation or overexpression, has been detected in a minority of cancers. More commonly solid tumors are ligand-responsive and require either autocrine or paracrine HGF for malignant transfor-mation [18][19][20]. Therefore, it was assumed that auto/paracrine loop with the activating ligands such as EGF and HGF would play a greater role in TNBC in which both EGFR and MET amplifications occur [21] and where elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptors was found in reverse phase protein array [22]. However, the data demonstrate that EGF and HGF activated downstream signaling in MDA-MB-468 and HCC 1395 but not the other breast cancer cell lines assessed. Whether this represents the underlying genetic aberrations in the lines with for example MD MB 231 cells have both RAS and RAF mutations remains to be ascertained.",

Triple negative breast cancer is now considered to represent a heterogenous group of diseases based on gene expression profiles of TNBC cell lines [29]. MDA-MB-468 is categorized as Basal-Like subtype and MDA-MB-231 is grouped as Mesenchymal-Like subtype while HCC 1395 is regarded as Unclassified. Therefore, in order to develop biomarkers of the treatment of EGFR and MET inhibition, TNBC should not be studied as a whole entity, rather it should be studied based on biomarkers such as a presence of active EGFR and MET pathways. In contrast to oncogenic addictions like activating mutation or gene rearrangement followed by constitutive sig-naling, receptor overexpression can contribute to activation of additional receptors or so called receptor co-activation [13,30]. In this case, it would be desirable to block both pathways after identification of the active receptor co-activation processes in future clinical trials.",
