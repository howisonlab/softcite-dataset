This article looks more carefully at the dynamics of transition from a non-rule-of-law state. The article identifies a commitment problem as the critical feature inhibiting the transition: the inability, under a rule of law, to forgive theft. This can lead to the perpetuation of the non-rule-of-law state, even when it might seem that the alternative is Pareto-improving. Why do dysfunctional institutions persist? It is now well understood that they persist if there are politically powerful losers from reform and no way to promise them compensation credibly. There are two possible lines of attack on this problem. The first investigates whether the problem of commitment can be solved dynamically. The second asks how a society evolves when such commitment is not possible. We are concerned with the second question. The presumption has been that if a reform is \u00d4good enough\u00d5, then once a society understands the magnitude of its benefits, sufficient demand for the reform will emerge that it will occur. Creating the rule of law is an example of such a reform. The rule of law stops the few from stealing from the many. In this view, one would expect the rule of law to emerge. 1 Even though we believe that the rule of law creates a vast majority of winners, we see that many societies are not moving towards the rule of law. In Russia and many other post-communist countries, little progress towards either forming a strong constituency for the rule of law, or establishing the rule of law, has been made since the privatisation of most state enterprises. 2 Figure 1 presents the distribution, for the earliest and latest years available, of World Bank scores of adherence to the rule of law for 27 postcommunist countries and the world as a whole. 3 In 1996, the post-communist countries * We thank Mayuresh Kshetramade for outstanding research assistance.

He may repeatedly announce that he is going to create it. . . .These subjective intentions are irrelevant, however. The rule of law is going to emerge only if there are strong constituencies supporting it. (p. 87) One possible explanation for this puzzle is that the rule of law is not such a great thing. Perhaps we have overestimated its ability to increase income or underestimated its distributional consequences, in particular, those that cannot be undone by credible commitments to redistribute. For example, the traditional view of the enclosure of the commons in England was that it created large, dispersed benefits. Yet Weitzman (1974) showed that most people could be worse off under the efficient enclosure than under inefficient free access rights. 4 The establishment of the rule of law in a lawless state is a more compelling example of a reform that should engender widespread support, since it is a movement from the jungle to order. Political philosophers from Hobbes to Nozick clearly viewed this kind of reform as an improvement. Economists have argued that although private, relation-based governance may suffice for a middle-income country, the rule of law is necessary to make the transition to a high-income country (Rodrik, 2003, p. 17;Dixit, 2004, p. 82). Yet, as Figure 1 illustrates, many societies do not seem to be moving towards the rule of law.",

Given the static nature of that model, only those who choose to build value benefit from the rule of law. Thus, the probability distribution of the political outcome depends on the fraction of the population that chooses to build value, which itself depends on the probability distribution of the political outcome. We showed that self-fulfilling Pareto-inferior equilbria may exist in which few agents build value and thus few demand the rule of law. 6 [ A U G U S T 2008 ] 1475 E X I T I N G A L A W L E S S S T A T E 4 Subsequently, Allen (1982) challenged the view that the enclosure movement enhanced efficiency. 5 See Hoff and Stiglitz (2004a), which also provides a brief review of the transition from communism in Russia.

Our framework is Markov; i.e. current and future outcomes are conditioned only on the current state.

Our departure from the existing work on the problem of credible commitment to compensate losers from reform is that we treat individuals\u00d5 economic interests as endogenous, whereas existing work 11 treats them as parametric. That modelling approach is appropriate when economic institutions are stable with regard to the political transitions that the model tries to explain, e.g. the case of the transitions from authoritarianism of Latin America and Southern Europe (O'Donnell et al., 1986). What is historically distinct about the post-communist transitions is the possibility of simultaneous deep change in both the economy and the polity.

Studies of privatisation all over the world have concluded that privatisation is unlikely to improve performance when corporate governance institutions are weak. 12 While noting in that case the absence of any benefit from privatisation, these studies overlook a cost that we emphasise here: by widening the scope for asset stripping, privatisation may create political forces opposed to establishing the rule of law. Not surprisingly, scholars have enjoined developing countries before privatising firms to \u00d4embrace a corporate governance perspective. . .that can constrain the grabbing hands of public and private actors\u00d5 (Dyck, 2001, p. 59). In Section 3, we extend our model to consider two policies that affect the demand for the rule of law -the sequencing and pacing of the post-communist transition and macroeconomic policy.",

In our model, in contrast, the victims of the dysfunctional institutions include those who choose them. To illustrate this, we present a numerical example. In the example, we assume: (a) a transition probability equal to the squared demand for the rule of law: Figure 5(a) shows that the stable equilibria of x* are 0 and 0.75. In the first case, no one opposes the establishment of the rule of law, and reform occurs in period 1. In the second case, three-fourths of the agents oppose the rule of law, and reform is delayed on average for 16 periods. 24  Figure 5(b) depicts the growth paths of agents\u00d5 expected aggregate lifetime income in these two cases. 25 Expected aggregate income is 20% lower along the path of delayed reform. Every agent is strictly worse off. 20 As emphasised by Greif (1994), culture is an equilibrium selection device and so it is interesting to consider within this model the role that culture might have played in Russia. Two facts suggest that the \u00d4good\u00d5 corner equilibrium, with x \u00c3 \u00bc 0, would not be a focal point: (a) managers commonly engaged in asset stripping well before the mass privatisation of 1992-4 (Grigoriev, 1992) and (b) most beneficiaries of the mass privatisation of large state enterprises in Russia were the managers. For instance, Varese (2001, Appendix B), finds in his survey of one Russian city in 1993 that 51% of the 92 full-time officials of the Communist Party in 1988 were top managers of economic enterprises. 21 We discuss other comparative statics results in Hoff and Stiglitz (2004a). 22 Or, more accurately, if the intersection of h \u00c3 (x; k) and the stripping ability curve lies along h a , not h p . 23 f \u00bc 0.05, I L \u00bc 0.01, I N \u00bc 0.0475,g \u00bc 1:05,z \u00bc 0:9, k \u00bc 0.3, and d \u00bc 0.945. Using (4), these values imply h max \u00bc 0.8. The EXCEL program is available at http://www.econ.worldbank.org/staff/khoff. 24 One can show by standard methods that given a transition probability p per period, the expected number of periods before reform is 1/p. If x \u00c3 \u00bc 0.75, then p(x \u00c3 ) \u00bc 0.0625 and the expected delay is 16 periods.",

A third set of effects relates to the political dynamics. Creating better corporate governance institutions before privatising large state enterprises reduces the incentives and scope for asset stripping and so influences the constituency for reform. Thus, if one plots social welfare in (19) as a function of the speed of privatisation, it may be that some delay in official privatisation trades off optimally the agency costs of state ownership with the agency costs and political risks (given weak corporate governance) of private ownership.

That authority gave him the opportunity to change the political forces in place before implementing privatisation.

Two recent developments shed light on the importance of agency costs in privatised firms in Russia: (a) A study finds that oligarchs who controlled state enterprises reported twice as much income as those who controlled private enterprises, \u00d4presumably because it was more difficult to hide incomes in those businesses\u00d5 (Braguinsky, forthcoming). The less income that is hidden, the less income that is likely diverted, with consequent deadweight losses. (b) One can interpret actions of Putin to limit the ability of privatised Russian firms to sell reserves of natural resources as reflecting his belief that this will reduce the diversion of assets (see The Russia Journal, \u00d4Kremlin eyes Russia's natural resources,\u00d5 Aug.

He chose not to do this and to focus instead on economic reforms first. 31 A third view is that while gradualism was not politically feasible in Russia because it would have expropriated powerful stakeholders, Big Bang privatisation was both feasible and also favourable to the progress of Russia towards a free market economy because it would change the interests of the key political players. Fast privatisation, moreover, would constrain the policy options of future governments that might oppose capitalism (Boycko et al., 1995;Shleifer and Treisman, 2000). 32 History cannot readily resolve counterfactual questions. However, Poland provides an example where advocates of Big Bang privatisation had argued that gradualism was not politically feasible but privatisation was delayed and wealth within the state was preserved (the rate of wastage l was low). Given Poland's success in preserving wealth and in moving towards the rule of law, 33 there is a strong presumption that Big Bang privatisation would have been inferior to the gradual privatisation strategy that Poland adopted. It is also plausible that Russia could have preserved a large fraction of its principal assets, natural resources, within the public sector: In extractive industries, one can at worst steal the flow. If the right to sell assets does not exist, no one can steal the capital value.",

There is an equilibrium in which this is not believed and justifiably so, because it does not produce the promised results if it is not believed.

Moreover, as economic historians have established, high inequality is itself a key factor in the creation and persistence of dysfunctional institutions; see e.g. Sokoloff (1997, 2003) and Acemoglu et al.

Without change, the model can be applied to the problem of post-conflict states in which economic and political structures have collapsed.

To those currently in possession of assets, there is a risk that another claimant to the property will appear and have the backing of law. This lowers the relative return to investing (relative to asset stripping). Stripping affects the political dynamics. It creates an additional obstacle to the movement towards the rule of law based on any conceivable criteria of legitimacy of property rights.",

But because no one pays for the use of the field, no one takes this cost fully into account in deciding how to exploit the field. The problem disappears if one individual owns the whole field and charges each individual for his use (Libecap 1989). However, anticipation of delay in unitisation leads to individual drilling. Imagine that every period of individual drilling gives a leaseholder private information about the value of his lease. Then he may gain from a delay in unitisation if his private information is favourable. Delay, by making the information public and so increasing his rental share under unitisation, offsets the impact on him",
