            "text": "Pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) catalyzes the last step of glycolysis and plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation. Recent studies have reported that PKM2 also regulates apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying such a role of PKM2 remain elusive. Here we show that PKM2 translocates to mitochondria under oxidative stress. In the mitochondria, PKM2 interacts with and phosphorylates Bcl2 at threonine (T) 69. This phosphorylation prevents the binding of Cul3-based E3 ligase to Bcl2 and subsequent degradation of Bcl2. A chaperone protein, HSP90\u03b11, is required for this function of PKM2. HSP90\u03b11's ATPase activity launches a conformational change of PKM2 and facilitates interaction between PKM2 and Bcl2. Replacement of wild-type Bcl2 with phosphorylation-deficient Bcl2 T69A mutant sensitizes glioma cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and impairs brain tumor formation in an orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, a peptide that is composed of the amino acid residues from 389 to 405 of PKM2, through which PKM2 binds to Bcl2, disrupts PKM2-Bcl2 interaction, promotes Bcl2 degradation and impairs brain tumor growth. In addition, levels of Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation, conformation-altered PKM2 and Bcl2 protein correlate with one another in specimens of human glioblastoma patients. Moreover, levels of Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation and conformation-altered PKM2 correlate with both grades and prognosis of glioma malignancy. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism through which mitochondrial PKM2 phosphorylates Bcl2 and inhibits apoptosis directly, highlight the essential role of PKM2 in ROS adaptation of cancer cells, and implicate HSP90-PKM2-Bcl2 axis as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma."

            "text": "Cancer cells exhibit increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than normal cells partly due to oncogenic stimulation, increased metabolic activity and mitochondrial malfunction [1][2][3]. Under persistent oxidative stress, cancer cells become well-adapted to such stress through a set of mechanisms, which not only activate ROS-scavenging systems but also inhibit apoptosis [4]. A number of studies have suggested that such adaptation contributes to malignant transformation, metastasis and resistance to anticancer drugs [5][6][7]. Therefore, understanding mechanisms of ROS adaptation is important to efficiently kill cancer cells and overcome drug resistance.",

            "text": "Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the final step of glycolysis and is comprised of four isoenzymes encoded by two distinct genes in mammals, PKLR and PKM. Alternative splicing of PKM pre-mRNA results in the generation of pyruvate kinase M1 (PKM1) and M2 (PKM2) by the inclusion of exon 9 and exon 10, respectively [8,9]. PKM2, but not PKM1, is upregulated in most human cancers. Replacement of PKM2 with PKM1 in lung cancer cells inhibits aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth in nude mouse xenograft [10]. Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human glioma cells leads to increased glucose uptake and lactate production in a PKM2 expression-dependent manner [11]. Mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent phosphorylation, PKM2 is capable of translocating to the nucleus upon EGRF activation [12]. In the nucleus, PKM2 binds to c-Src-phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin and enhances \u03b2-catenin's transactivation activity, promoting the expression of downstream oncogene cyclin D1 and the progression of cell cycle [13]. Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl-hydroxylated PKM2 interacts with HIF1a to induce glycolytic gene expression, which in turn enhances glucose metabolism in cancer cells [14]. These findings demonstrate the crucial roles of PKM2 in tumor cell proliferation.",

It has been shown that depletion of PKM2 expression by small interfering RNAs specifically against PKM2 results in decreased viability and increased apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines [15]. Silencing of PKM2 in rat and human glioma spheroids enhances both apoptosis and differentiation [16]. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PKM2 deficiency enhances ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis and autophagy in vitro and in vivo [17]. In addition to its anti-apoptotic function, PKM2 has been reported to translocate to the nucleus and induce a caspase-independent cell death in response to TT-232 [18]. These results indicate that PKM2 also plays instrumental roles in cell survival. However, the mechanism underlying such roles of PKM2 remains elusive. B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family and is amplified in many human cancers [19]. The role of Bcl2 in ROS adaptation has been investigated in various laboratories. Ling et al. [20] demonstrated that ROS generation plays a vital role in the initiation of apoptotic cascade by proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Overexpression of Bcl2 in prostate carcinoma cells diminishes bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Hildeman et al. [21] found that superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic MnTBAP decreases intracellular ROS and prevents apoptosis of activated T cells in vitro. Their study showed that MnTBAP increases the expression of Bcl2, which is normally decreased by T-cell activation [21]. These findings indicate that Bcl2 plays an important role in ROS adaptation in different cell types. However, the mechanism through which Bcl2 is regulated during such adaptation is not well understood.",

After hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) or diamide (a thiol-oxidizing compound) treatment, U87 or U251 cells with PKM2 depletion (U87/shPKM2 or U251/shPKM2) had much more apoptotic cells than those cells expressing non-targeting shRNA (U87/shNT or U251/shNT), as determined by flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V-positive cells ( Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Figure S1B). Similarly, caspase 3 activity was much more robust in U87/shPKM2 or U251/shPKM2 cells than that in U87/ shNT or U251/shNT cells after H 2 O 2 treatment ( Figure  1B). Cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria to the cytosol, where it binds to Apaf1 to activate caspase cascades, during the early stage of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis [22]. Figure 1C showed that more cytochrome c was detected in cytosolic fraction in U87/ shPKM2 or U251/shPKM2 cells than that in the cells expressing shNT after H 2 O 2 treatment. Immune cells, such as Jurkat T cells, also express high levels of PKM2. To determine whether PKM2 has similar anti-apoptotic function in Jurkat T cells, we depleted endogenous PKM2 in Jurkat T cells and examined the effect of PKM2 depletion on H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis. PKM2 depletion did not significantly increase the percentage of apoptotic cells in Jurkat T cells after H 2 O 2 treatment (Supplementary information, Figure S1C), suggesting the cell-type specificity of PKM2 anti-apoptotic function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PKM2 is essential for the resistance of glioma cells to oxidative stress-induced and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.",

Immunofluorescent analysis with anti-PKM2 or anti-VDAC (ubiquitously expressed and located in the outer mitochondrial membrane) antibody showed that ~15% of PKM2 was translocated to the mitochondria in U87 cells upon H 2 O 2 treatment ( Figure 1D), which was supported by a subcellular fractionation analysis, showing that more PKM2 was detected in mitochondrial fraction of U87 or U251 cells after H 2 O 2 treatment ( Figure 1E). More thorough experiments of submitochondrial fractionation were also performed, showing that PKM2 was translocated to outer membrane of mitochondria upon H 2 O 2 treatment (Supplementary information, Figure S1D). Thus, we speculated that PKM2 might regulate apoptosis via modulation of mitochondrial proteins. To test this possibility, we performed a mass spectrometry analysis of proteins associated with mitochondrial PKM2. Among them, three Bcl2 family proteins, including Bcl2, Bcl-xl and Bax, were identified (Supplementary information, Table S1). These proteins have been reported to regulate apoptosis by controlling mitochondrial membrane permeability [19]. Interactions between PKM2 and these proteins were further validated by co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Both Bcl2 and Bax could interact with PKM2, whereas Bcl-xl failed to do so (Supplementary information, Figure S1E). However, only Bcl2 protein level was markedly decreased in H 2 O 2 -treated U87/shPKM2 cells, whereas levels of Bclxl or Bax proteins were not ( Figure 1F). mRNA levels of Bcl2 showed no significant difference between U87/ shNT and U87/shPKM2 cells with or without H 2 O 2 treatment, suggesting that PKM2 post-transcriptionally regulated Bcl2 ( Figure 1G). Furthermore, treatment of a potent proteasome inhibitor MG132 abrogated H 2 O 2 -induced decrease of Bcl2 protein level in U87/shPKM2 cells ( Figure 1H). These data confirmed that PKM2 depletion enhanced a proteasome-mediated degradation of Bcl2 induced by H 2 O 2 treatment. Consistently, H 2 O 2 induced more Bcl2 polyubiquitination in U87/shPKM2 cells than in U87/shNT cells ( Figure 1I). These findings demonstrate that PKM2 translocates to the mitochondria and sustains Bcl2 protein stability, therefore enhancing the resistance of tumor cells to oxidative stress.",

To narrow searching range for Bcl2-interacting region on PKM2, we tested whether PKM1 interacts with Bcl2. U87 cells were infected with a lentivirus expressing Flag-tagged PKM2 (Flag-PKM2) or Flag-PKM1. Immunoblotting analyses of immunoprecipitated Flag-PKM2 or Flag-PKM1 with an anti-Bcl2 antibody showed that PKM1, unlike PKM2, did not interact with Bcl2 after H 2 O 2 treatment ( Figure 2C), suggesting that PKM2 may interact with Bcl2 through the region encoded by exon 10 of PKM2. According to secondary structure of PKM2 exon 10, we constructed four S-Flag-Streptavidin-binding peptide (SFB)-tagged PKM2 mutants with the deletion of the indicated amino acid residues, including PKM2 \u0394370-388, PKM2 \u0394389-405, PKM2 \u0394406-423 and PKM2 \u0394424-435. Immunoblotting analyses of precipitated SFB-PKM2 proteins with anti-Bcl2 antibody showed that only PKM2 \u0394389-405 failed to bind to Bcl2 among PKM2 mutants ( Figure  2D). Bcl2 has been reported to interact with other proteins through hydrophobic or ionic bonds [23]. According to amino acid properties, we constructed two PKM2 mutants, PKM2 ILLL, in which hydrophobic amino acids (isoleucine 389, leucine 392, leucine 394 and leucine 398) were mutated to alanine, and PKM2 EERR, in which ionic amino acids (glutamic acid 396, glutamic acid 397, arginine 399, and arginine 400) were mutated to alanine. Both PKM2 WT and PKM2 EERR interacted with Bcl2, whereas PKM2 ILLL failed to do so ( Figure  2E and Supplementary information, Figure S2E).",

The data showed that similar glucose consumption and lactate production were detected in both PKM2 WT-and ILLL-reconstituted U87 cells (Supplementary information, Figure S2G). We previously reported that PKM2 could phosphorylate Histone H3 at threonine (T) 11 [24]. Thus, we examined the phosphorylation of Histone H3 T11 by PKM2 WT or ILLL. The data showed that both PKM2 WT and ILLL could phosphorylate Histone H3 T11 at similar levels (Supplementary information, Figure S2H). Together, these data suggested that PKM2 ILLL only lost the binding to Bcl2, but still reserved its pyruvate kinase and protein kinase activities.",

Recombinant His-Bcl2 and GST-PKM2 were purified from bacteria. Purities of two proteins were examined by gel staining with Coomassie Blue (Supplementary information, Figure S3A). GST pulldown assays were performed by mixing PKM2 and Bcl2 or PKM2 and commercial Histone H3 (NEB) that has been reported to interact with PKM2 in vitro [24]. The data showed that Bcl2 could not bind to PKM2 in vitro, whereas Histone H3 could do so ( Figure 3A). Analysis of PKM2 structure implied that PKM2 389-405 fragment, especially four hydrophobic amino acids (I389, L392, L394 and L398) of PKM2 that are essential for PKM2-Bcl2 interaction, are mostly buried inside (Supplementary information, Figure S3B). Thus, we proposed that PKM2 structure should be altered to expose those critical amino acids. To search for potential isomerase, we performed a mass spectrum analysis of proteins associated with total PKM2 after H 2 O 2 treatment. HSP90\u03b11 was identified to be the only associated protein that can alter protein conformation (Supplementary information, Table S2).",

            "text": "HSP90\u03b11, an isoform of HSP90, is a chaperone protein that assists other proteins to fold properly, stabilizes proteins against heat stress and aids in protein degradation. To determine whether HSP90\u03b11 is required for PKM2-Bcl2 interaction, we depleted HSP90\u03b11 in U87 cells with a shRNA against HSP90AA1 (Supplementary information, Figure S3C). Immunoblotting analyses of immunoprecipitated Bcl2 with anti-PKM2 antibody showed that HSP90\u03b11 depletion abrogated the interaction between PKM2 and Bcl2 ( Figure 3C). To map the interacting region of HSP90\u03b11 and PKM2, three deletion mutants of HSP90\u03b11 were constructed ( Figure 3D), including N-terminal deletion mutant (\u0394N), middle domain mutant (MD) and C-terminal deletion mutant (\u0394C). Among three HSP90\u03b11 mutants, only HSP90\u03b11 MD could bind to PKM2 ( Figure 3E). To further pinpoint the exact interacting region on HSP90\u03b11, three more deletion mutants of HSP90\u03b11 were constructed according to crystal structure of HSP90\u03b11 [25], including HSP90\u03b11 1-293, 1-360 and 1-469. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses of HSP90\u03b11 WT and mutants showed that only HSP90\u03b11 1-293 lost the binding to PKM2 among the mutants under H 2 O 2 treatment ( Figure 3F). The region spanning amino acids 327-340 of HSP90\u03b2, which is homologous to the region spanning amino acids 347-360 of HSP90\u03b11, has been reported to be involved in the binding to its client protein AKT [26]. Thus, we tested whether amino acids 347-360 of HSP90\u03b11 are required for its binding to PKM2. HSP90\u03b11 deletion mutant, HSP901 \u0394347-360 lost the binding to PKM2 after H 2 O 2 treatment ( Figure 3G). Meanwhile, we also mapped the region of HSP90\u03b11-PKM2 interaction on PKM2. Supplementary information, Figure S3D showed that both PKM2 \u0394389-405 and PKM2 \u0394406-423 lost their binding to HSP90\u03b11. Ionic bonds are often involved in HSP90 substrate binding [26]. Considering simultaneous surface exposure of the interacting amino acids of PKM2, four ionic amino acids (R399, R400, D407 and E410) of PKM2, which are located on the surface of PKM2 protein, were mutated to alanine (PKM2 RRDE). Co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that PKM2 WT interacted with HSP90\u03b11 upon H 2 O 2 treatment, whereas PKM2 RRDE mutant failed to do so (Supplementary information, Figure  S3E). Together, these results demonstrated that amino acids 347-360 of HSP90\u03b11 are involved in the binding to PKM2, and that PKM2 is likely a client protein of HSP90\u03b11.",

Immunoblotting analyses of precipitated GST-PKM2 with a PKM2-389 antibody, which specifically recognizes PKM2 389-405 fragment that is buried inside the protein before H 2 O 2 treatment, showed that GST-PKM2 could only be recognized by PKM2-389 antibody in the presence of HSP90\u03b11 WT, but not HSP90\u03b11 G97D ( Figure 3H), suggesting that PKM2 conformation was altered by HSP90\u03b11 to expose PKM2 389-405 fragment. We further examined this result in cells. U87 cells were depleted of endogenous HSP90\u03b11 and reconstituted with the expression of rHSP90\u03b11 WT or rHSP90\u03b11 G97D (Supplementary information, Figure S3F).

            "text": "To further explore the cellular functions of PKM2-dependent Bcl2 phosphorylation, apoptosis analyses were performed in U87 cells under various types of treatments. As shown in Supplementary information, Figure S5G and S5H, more apoptotic cells were observed in PKM2-depleted U87 cells with reconstituted expression of rPKM2 ILLL or Bcl2-depleted U87 cells with reconstituted expression of rBcl2 T69A than those in the cells expressing rPKM2 WT or rBcl2 WT after TNF\u03b1 or PTX treatment. It has been extensively reported that the treatment of TNF\u03b1 or PTX induces significant ROS production and ROS plays an essential role in TNF\u03b1-or PTX-induced apoptosis [30,31]. Thus, PKM2-dependent Bcl2 regulation induced by TNF\u03b1 or PTX is very likely mediated by increased ROS after the treatment. This hypothesis was simply tested by using the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) to decrease intracellular ROS levels. The data showed that NAC treatment significantly abrogated TNF\u03b1-or PTX-induced apoptosis in PKM2-depleted U87 cells, and that TNF\u03b1-or PTX-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation at T69 was also inhibited by NAC treatment (Supplementary information, Figure S5I and S5J). These results indicate that TNF\u03b1-or PTX-induced Bcl2 regulation by PKM2 was ROS dependent, suggesting a specific role of PKM2 under oxidative stress.",

After 15 days, 7 mice were sacrificed to examine tumor growth; the remaining mice were intratumorally injected with the lentivirus expressing to excess production of ROS [32][33][34]. Therefore, cancer cells are particularly challenged while dealing with oxidative stress [35,36]. To evaluate the contribution of PKM2-dependent Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation to brain tumor development, we intracranially injected (1) Bcl2-depleted U87 cells with reconstituted expression of rBcl2 WT or T69A, (2) PKM2-depleted U87 cells with reconstituted expression of rPKM2 WT or ILLL, or (3) Bcl2 WT-or T69E-expressing U87 cells that were depleted of PKM2 and reconstituted with the expression of rPKM2 ILLL (Supplementary information, Figure S5O) into randomized athymic nude mice. Analyses of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and tumor volume showed that cells expressing rPKM2 WT or rBcl2 WT elicited rapid tumorigenesis. In contrast, brain tumor development was markedly dampened by the expression of rPKM2 ILLL or rBcl2 T69A. Notably, rPKM2 ILLL expression-suppressed tumorigenesis was restored by Bcl2 T69E expression, but not Bcl2 WT expression ( Figure 6C and 6D). Clear boundaries between tumor cells and normal cells without obvious inflammatory lesions were observed in the brain sections from the mice inoculated with genetically-modified U87 cells ( Figure 6C and 6D, middle panel). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that mice injected with the cells expressing rBcl2 T69A or rPKM2 ILLL survived longer time than mice injected with the cells expressing rBcl2 WT or rPKM2 WT. Consistently, the expression of Bcl2 T69E, but not Bcl2 WT, could significantly shorten the survival time of the mice inoculated with PKM2 ILLL-reconstituted U87 cells ( Figure 6E).",

On day 40, analyses of H&E staining and tumor volume showed that expression of PKM2 389-405 peptide, but not Flag peptide, significantly impaired tumor growth ( Figure 6H). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed the mice injected with the lentivirus expressing PKM2 389-405 peptide had much longer survival time than the mice injected with the lentivirus expressing Flag peptides ( Figure 6I). Luciferase-labeled U87 cells were also used to evaluate therapeutic potential of PKM2 peptides.

On day 40, the mice injected with the lentivirus expressing PKM2 389-405 peptide bear much smaller tumor than the mice injected with the lentivirus expressing Flag peptides. Consistent results were obtained in mice implanted with U251 cells followed by the injection of the lentivirus expressing Flag peptide or PKM2 389-405 peptide, showing that the expression of PKM2 peptide markedly prolonged mouse survival (Supplementary information, Figure S5T). Immunoblotting analyses of the dissected tumor tissues showed decreased level of Bcl2 and increased level of cleaved caspase 3 in tumor tissues derived from the mice injected with the lentivirus expressing PKM2 389-405 peptide compared to those in the counterpart tissues derived from the mice injected with the lentivirus expressing Flag peptides ( Figure 6J). Together, these results demonstrate that PKM2 389-405 peptide could inhibit gliomagenesis effectively, highlighting therapeutic potential of PKM2 peptide as an anti-tumor drug.",

Mitochondrial PKM2 interacts with and phosphorylates Bcl2. PKM2-dependent Bcl2 phosphorylation prevents Bcl2 degradation and thereby inhibits ROS-induced apoptosis. In addition to apoptosis inhibition, cancer cells also activate ROS-scavenging systems to cope with increased ROS levels [4]. PKM2 is also involved in this process. Increased intracellular ROS level causes inhibition of glycolytic activity of PKM2 through oxidation of cysteine 358, which diverts glucose flux into the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby generating sufficient reducing potential for detoxification of ROS [39]. Thus, PKM2 can promote the adaptation of cancer cells to ROS at two levels, suggesting therapeutic potential of targeting PKM2.",

In the nucleus, PKM2 interacts with \u03b2-catenin and thereby enhances transactivation activity of \u03b2-catenin, which enhances downstream oncogene expression [13]. Nuclear translocation of PKM2 was also observed by Lv et al. [40], showing that PKM2 K433 acetylation that was mediated by the p300 acetyltransferase prevents the binding of FBP to PKM2 and thereby facilitates nuclear translocation of PKM2 and its switch from a cytoplasmic metabolic enzyme to a nuclear protein kinase. Both studies demonstrated nuclear localization and functions of PKM2. In this study, we showed for the first time that PKM2 translocates to the mitochondria under oxidative stress. Submitochondrial fractionation analyses showed that PKM2 translocated to outermembrane of mitochondria (Supplementary information, Figure S1D).

Bub3 and myosin light chain 2 are also phosphorylated by PKM2 to promote mitosis and cytokinesis in the context of cell cycle [42,43]. Moreover, protein kinase activity of PKM2 on Histone H3 can be enhanced by succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-ribose-5\u2032-phosphate (SAICAR) and over 100 proteins were identified to be phosphorylated by PKM2 [44]. Notably, protein kinase activity of PKM2 was further supported by two recent publications, showing (1) that yeast PKM2 homolog directly phosphorylates histone H3 at T11 both in vivo and in vitro, and (2) that nuclear PKM2 phosphorylates Stat3 and promotes proinflammatory phenotype of macrophages in coronary artery disease through boosting IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 production [45,46]. Together, these studies demonstrate the protein kinase activity of PKM2 in the nucleus.

SLAMF1 deficiency in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) increased ROS accumulation and induced Bcl2 phosphorylation, thereby promoting autophagic flux [31]. Flubendazole (a potent inducer of autophagy) activates JNK1, leading to Bcl2 phosphorylation at S70 and subsequent release of Beclin1 from Bcl2-Beclin1 complex for autophagy induction [30]. During mitotic arrest, sustained JNK activation dramatically increases Bcl2 phosphorylation, resulting in the inactivation of anti-apoptotic function of Bcl2 [47]. Mimicking phosphorylation of the putative mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase sites of Bcl2 protein (T56, T74 and S87) abolishes TN-F\u03b1-induced Bcl2 degradation and apoptosis [48]. Bcl2 phosphorylation (T69, S70 and S87) confers resistance of CLL cells to the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 by impeding direct binding [49]. Together, these studies elaborated that Bcl2 phosphorylation is a pivotal mechanism for the regulation of Bcl2 functions. However, role of the phos-phorylation in regulation of Bcl2 anti-apoptotic function is controversial and upstream kinase that phosphorylates Bcl2 at T69 remains elusive. In this study, we revealed that PKM2 phosphorylates Bcl2 at T69 in the mitochondria, which prevents the binding of Cul3-based E3 ligase to Bcl2 and stabilizes Bcl2, thereby inhibiting oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Notably, Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation by PKM2 has been confirmed by in vitro kinase assay and mass spectrometry analyses.",

In cancer cells, it can stabilize some proteins encoded by oncogenes, such as EGFR, PI3K and AKT [51][52][53]. HSP90 possesses ATPase activity and induces conformational changes in client proteins, thereby causing activation of such proteins [54]. In this study, we demonstrate that HSP90 interacts with and isomerizes PKM2 upon oxidative stress. Isomerized PKM2 is required for Bcl2 phosphorylation and the inhibition of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Our finding identifies PKM2 as a new substrate of HSP90 and uncovers a novel mechanism of HSP90 regulating apoptosis via modulation of PKM2.",

Intracranial injections were performed as described in a previous publication [59]. Seven mice per group in each experiment were included. Mice injected with U87 cells were sacrificed 40 days after implantation. U87 cells were intracranially injected into randomized athymic nude mice. After 15 days, 7 mice were sacrificed to examine tumor growth; the remaining mice were intracranially injected with the lentivirus-expressing Flag or PKM2 (389-405) peptides, and then sacrificed on day 40. The brain of each mouse was collected, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Tumor formation and phenotype were determined by histologic analysis of H&E-stained sections. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the mice intracranially injected with the indicated U87 or U251 cells were performed with ten mice per group. The use of mice was in compliance with ethical regulations and was approved by the institutional review board at the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology.",

Bioluminescence imaging with a CCD camera (IVIS, Xenogen) was initiated 10 min after injection with 2 min exposure time. Bioluminescence from the region of interest was defined manually. Background was defined using a region of interest from a mouse that was not given an intraperitoneal injection of D-luciferin. All bioluminescent data were collected and analyzed using IVIS."

We quantitatively scored the tissue sections according to the percentage of positive cells and staining intensity, as previously defined [60]. We rated the intensity of staining on a scale of 0-3: 0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong. We assigned the following proportion scores: 0 if 0% of the tumor cells showed positive staining, 1 if 0%-1% of cells were stained, 2 if 2%-10% were stained, 3 if 11%-30% were stained, 4 if 31%-70% were stained, and 5 if 71%-100% were stained. We then combined the proportion and intensity scores to obtain a total score (range, 0-8), as described previously [60]. Scores were compared with overall survival, defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to death or last known date of follow-up. All patients received standard adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery, followed by treatment with an alkylating agent (TMZ in most cases). The use of human brain tumor specimens and the database was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and the Institutional Review Board at First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Data represent the mean \u00b1 SD of 80 stained GBM specimens and 40 stained astrocytoma specimens.",
