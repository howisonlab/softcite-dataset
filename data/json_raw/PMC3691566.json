            "text": "Phagocytosis is crucial for triggering host defenses against invading pathogens in animals. However, the receptors on phagocyte surface required for phagocytosis of virus have not been extensively explored. This study demonstrated that white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), a major pathogen of shrimp, could be engulfed but not digested by Drosophila S2 cells, indicating that the virus was not recognized and taken up by a pathway that was silent and would not activate the phagosome maturation and digestion pathway. The results showed that the activation of receptors on S2 cell surface by lipopolysaccharide or peptidoglycan resulted in the phagocytosis of S2 cells against WSSV virions. Gene expression profiles revealed that the dally-mediated Wnt signaling pathway was involved in S2 phagocytosis. Further data showed that the Wnt signaling pathway played an essential role in phagocytosis. Therefore, our study contributed novel insight into the molecular mechanism of phagocytosis in animals. P hagocytosis, a highly conserved process, is crucial for the immune responses of animals and it allows for rapid engulfment of pathogens and apoptotic cells by specialized phagocytes 1-5. During phagocytosis, outer particles are recognized by binding to the surface of phagocytes, engulfed by cytoskeleton rearrangement to form the phagosome, and are then digested in a mature phagosome 4. Phagocytes discriminate among diverse particles through the array of receptors expressed on their surfaces 5. Receptors bound with particles trigger an orderly progression of cellular changes leading to rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling. Central to these processes is the generation of a phagosome 6. Once formed, the phagosome undergoes maturation by fission and limited fusion events with endosomes, lysosomes, or both to generate the mature phagolysosome 7,8. Pathogens inside the phagolysosome are destroyed by low pH, hydrolysis, and radicals. However, the receptors on phagocyte surface required for phagocytosis of virus have not been extensively explored. Generally, it is believed that the phagocytosis process is initiated by the ligation of cell surface receptors that either directly bind to the particles or the opsonins that are deposited on the particle's surface. To date, the Fc receptor of immunoglobulin (Ig) on phagocyte surface greatly contributes to our knowledge about receptors and their pathways responsible for phagocytosis 9,10,11,12. The in vitro studies have confirmed the roles of the Fc receptor in triggering effector responses such as macrophage phagocytosis 13,14. The receptor is relocated to phagolysosomes during phagocytosis of IgG opsonized bacteria 15. In invertebrates, the pattern recognition receptors play essential roles in the antibacterial immunity. The activated pattern recognition receptors trigger Imd and Toll pathways in fighting bacteria and fungi infections 16-19. The receptor, peptidoglycan (PG) recognition protein LC (PGRP-LC), induces phagocytosis of Gram-negative bacteria via activation of the Imd signaling pathway 16,17,20,21. The Toll pathway induced by PGRP-SA (SD) and Gram-negative-binding protein (GNBP1 or GNBP3) leads to the activation of the phagocytosis of Gram-positive bacteria and fungi 16,17,22. As reported, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria can activate the Imd signaling pathway. To date, however, no IgG-like receptor has ever been found on phagocytes from invertebrates due to the lack of the acquired immunity in invertebrates. Therefore, it is believed that there are some specific receptors and their corresponding signaling pathways in phagocytes of invertebrates that are comparable to the Ig receptors on invertebrate phagocytes. But this issue has not yet been addressed. We have found that white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), a major pathogen of shrimp, could be engulfed by Drosophila melanogaster Schneider line 2 cells (S2 cells), a phagocytic cell line. However, the WSSV virions were",

To observe the distribution of the virions within the cells, the WSSV-inoculated cells were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the WSSV virions were engulfed and enveloped by vesicles for 5 days (Fig. 1A). This phenomenon indicated that WSSV, as a non-pathogenic virus of Drosophila, could not be digested by S2 cells which have strong phagocytic activity. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) data showed that the viral copies did not change in S2 cells at 1-5 days after WSSV inoculation ( Fig. S1), suggesting that the WSSV virions were engulfed but did not replicate in S2 cells. These findings suggested that WSSV could be recognized and engulfed by S2 cells but not digested/degraded and this virus was not infectious since it could not replicate inside S2 cells and trigger its release from these S2 cells to further propagate and infect other cells.",

The TEM results showed that the inactivated E. coli and S. xiamenensis were engulfed in S2 cells at 1 hr after inoculation ( Fig. 1B). At day 1 after inoculation, they were completely digested in the S2 cells ( Fig. 1B). Because E. coli is a pathogenic bacterium of D. melanogaster, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) located on the outer membrane of E. coli can activate the Imd pathway via Drosophila peptidoglycan recognition protein LC (PGRP-LC), leading to the activation of phagocytes. Peptidoglycan (PG), which is distributed on the outer membrane of S. xiamenensis, a non-pathogenic bacterium of D. melanogaster, can initiate the Toll pathway via PGRP-SA (SD) and Gram-negative bacteria binding confocal microscopy (4003). The FITC-labeled inactivated Escherichia coli or non-inactivated WSSV virions [WSSV (live)] were inoculated into S2 cells. LPS or PG was included in the inoculation to activate the receptors recognizing LPS or PG. The cells were fixed at different time points after inoculation.

The array analysis showed that the gene expression profiles of S2 cells treated with inactivated or non-inactivated DCV or WSSV differed largely from those of the control (non-treated S2 cells) ( Fig. 3a). Compared with the control, 802, 737, 524, and 877 genes were altered by at least two fold for inactivated DCV, non-inactivated DCV [DCV (live)], inactivated WSSV, and non-inactivated WSSV [WSSV (live)], respectively (Fig. 3a). The results showed that 626 genes (250 up-regulated genes and 376 down-regulated genes) in S2 cells treated with inactivated or non-inactivated DCV had the same gene expression patterns, indicating that infection and phagocytosis of the pathogenic virus might share many same or similar pathways. However, the gene expression profiles of S2 cells treated with inactivated or non-inactivated WSSV differed largely ( Fig. 3a), suggesting that the live non-pathogenic virus activated different pathways than the non-pathogenic inactivated virus.

Among these genes, 53 genes were up-regulated and 67 genes were down-regulated.

            "text": "These down-regulated and up-regulated genes were further analyzed to investigate the cell receptors and receptor-mediated pathways involved in phagocytosis. Gene ontology and KEGG analysis revealed that the dally (division abnormally delayed) receptor and its corresponding Wnt pathway was involved in phagocytosis (Fig. 3C). The results showed that dally receptor, located on the cell surface, could interact with eight proteins including amphiphysin (Amph), glutactin (Glt), inscuteable (insc), pericardin (prc), heartless (htl), matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Mmp1), frizzled 2 (fz2) and disheveled associated activator of morphogenesis (DAAM) (Fig. 3c). Among the eight proteins, fz2 and DAAM were the components of the Wnt signaling pathway. We found that DAAM interacted with myosin 31DF (Myo31DF), a cytoskeletal protein that demonstrated actin binding and motor activities. These data suggested that the Wnt pathway may be involved in phagosome maturation (Fig. 3d). The analysis showed that Amph (required in endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and vesicle fission), Glt (acidic sulphated glycoprotein of basement membrane), and insc (a cytoskeletal adaptor) could interact with the dally receptor ( Fig. 3c). In this context, the interaction between the dally receptor and Amph, Glt, or insc led to the suggestion that the dally receptor played a key role in phagosome maturation through regulating cytoskeletal organization (Fig. 3d). The findings indicated that prc, htl, and Mmp1 might be related to phagosome maturation, but the corresponding pathways mediated by the three proteins were unknown. Taken together, the results suggested that the dally receptors on the cell surface might mediate Wnt signaling pathway that was involved in phagosome maturation.  Roles of the dally-mediated Wnt pathway in phagocytosis. In order to evaluate the roles of the dally-mediated pathways in phagocytosis, we examined the expression profiles of eight genes (Amph, Glt, insc, prc, htl, Mmp1, fz2, and DAAM) encoding proteins that interacted with dally, as well as dally and Myo31DF, using S2 cells in response to LPS or PG stimulation. The quantitative RT-PCR results indicated that the expressions of dally, Amph, Glt, prc, htl, fz2, DAAM, and Myo31DF were very significantly up-regulated (P , 0.01) compared to that of the control gene rp49 after LPS or PG stimulation (Fig. 4A). The results showed that the dally-mediated pathways (Fig. 3d) were involved in phagosome maturation. However, the expression profiles of insc and Mmp1 did not change after LPS or PG stimulation (Fig. 4A). Of the dally-mediated pathways (Fig. 3d), fz2 and DAAM belong to the Wnt pathway. To characterize the role of Wnt pathway in phagosome maturation, we detected the gene expression profiles of the Wnt pathway in response to LPS or PG stimulation. The results indicated that dally, wnt2, fz2, dsh, DAAM, sgg, and arm were very significantly up-regulated (P , 0.01) after LPS or PG stimulation ( Fig. 4A and B). The data suggested that the Wnt pathway may take great effects on phagosome maturation.",

We investigated the expression levels of wnt2, fz2, dsh, DAAM, sgg, and arm to reveal the effects of dally gene silencing on the expression of genes belonging to the Wnt pathway. The results showed that dsh and arm were very significantly downregulated (P , 0.01) whereas sgg and wnt2 were very significantly up-regulated (P , 0.01) when dally was knocked down (Fig. 4C). The silencing of dally gene expression led to up-regulation or down-regulation of seven genes (Amph, Glt, prc, htl, fz2, DAAM, and Myo31DF) that were involved in dally-mediated pathways ( Fig. 4D). However, insc and Mmp1 gene expressions were not affected largely. The data were consistent with the quantitative RT-PCR results. We found that Amph, prc, fz2, and Myo31DF were significantly up-regulated (P , 0.05) whereas Glt, htl, and DAAM were significantly down-regulated (P , 0.05) when dally was knocked down (Fig. 4D). The results showed that the phagocytic percentage of pHrodo-labeled inactivated WSSV in dally-siRNA-treated S2 cells was significantly decreased (P , 0.01) compared with that of the control at 1 hr after inoculation (Fig. 4E). LPS and PG could induce the uptake and digestion of live WSSV into a fully matured phagosome (Fig. 4E). The silencing of dally expression significantly inhibited the phagosome maturation process. These findings suggested that the dally-mediated Wnt pathway might be essential for phagocytosis (Fig. 4F).",

            "text": "Widespread evidence indicates that phagocytosis, an actin-dependent process involving the internalization of bacteria and viruses, represents an essential branch of the immune system of organisms 2,23 . The phagocytic process begins with particle recognition and binding with receptors on host cell surface, leading to the engulfment of particles into cell and subsequent formation of phagosomes to initiate the digestion of microbes. Phagocyte-microbe contact is accompanied by intracellular signals that trigger diverse cellular processes such as cytoskeletal rearrangement, alterations in membrane trafficking, and activation of microbial killing mechanisms 24 . It is believed that the engulfment of particles into cell represents the initiation of phagocysotis. In this study, the results showed that the non-pathogenic WSSV could be engulfed by phagocytes (S2 cells), but the WSSV virions were not digested in S2 cells, suggesting that the phagosome maturation might not occur. The findings indicated that the engulfed particles could be digested by phagocytes when the phagosome maturation was induced. Now that the engulfment of particles by phagocytes does not represent triggering the digestion of engulfed particles, the strategy used for the evaluation of phagocytosis with fluorescently labeled latex beads [25][26][27] needs to be improved. The fluorescently labeled latex beads may be used to assess the ability of phagocyte engulfment only. If they are used for examining the phagocytic activity of phagocytes, the beads can be coated with LPS or PG to induce the phagosome maturation leading to digestion/degradation of particles.",

            "text": "Our study demonstrated that the non-pathogenic virus WSSV would not be completely digested by phagocytes, although the WSSV virions were engulfed into S2 cells. Recently this similar phenomenon was observed in Ehrlichia chaffeensis, a member of the order Rickettsiales. It was found that Drosophila S2 cells were permissive for the growth of E. chaffeensis, and the cells could completely digested E. chaffeensis after LPS stimulation 23 . It is well documented that the recognition of bacterial and fungal pathogens by receptors on cell surface leads to activations of the Toll and Imd pathways in invertebrates 16,17,21 . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria, is one of the most powerful activators of macrophages via the Imd pathway, while peptidoglycan (PG), a major component of gram-positive bacterial cell walls, can activate macrophages via the Toll pathway 28,29 . Recent studies show that some microbes can be engulfed but not digested by the phagocytes of mammals and insects 20,30 . These findings suggest that some receptors, except for the known receptors, are essential for phagocytosing intracellular pathogens efficiently by host phagocytes. The present and previous studies show that activation of the LPS-or PG-induced Imd and Toll pathways favor the uptake and digestion of microbes into a fully matured phagosome 31,32 . Up to date, the well-documented receptor for phagocytosis is Fc receptor in vertebrates 32 . In this context, there must be some unrevealed receptors on invertebrate phagocyte surface to trigger the phagocytosis response, which may be comparable to the Fc receptor. In this study, based on the genome-wide microarray analysis of Drosophila, the results showed that the dally-mediated Wnt signaling pathway played important roles in phagocytosis. As reported, the Wnt pathway is highly conserved between flies and humans despite the evolutionary distance between the species 33 . The Wnt family of signaling proteins participates in multiple developmental events during embryogenesis, and Wnt signals are pleiotropic, with effects that include mitogenic stimulation, cell fate specification, and differentiation 34,35 . Recently, it is found that the Wnt-induced endocytosis can initiate synapse formation and endosomes may constitute a crucial signaling organelle [36][37][38] . In our study, the results indicated that the dally-mediated Wnt pathway took effects on phagocytosis. This finding contributed a novel aspect of Wnt pathway in immune responses of animals, and the dally-mediated pathways in phagocytosis merited to be further investigated.",

Non-treated S2 cells were used as a control. Red indicated the up-regulation and green showed the down-regulation. The differentially expressed genes were evaluated (down). The numbers represented the genes up-regulated or down-regulated (more than twofold) compared with the control. (b) The biological processes mediated by the differentially expressed genes. (c) The gene network of the dally mediated pathways. The green and blue lines indicated the GenMAPP and KEGG databases, respectively. The numbers indicated the times that two genes occurred in a pathway. (d) The model of the dally mediated pathways in phagocytosis. The dally receptor was distributed on the cell membrane.

To evaluate the involvement of dally in phagocytosis, expression of the dally gene in S2 cells was silenced using sequence-specific siRNA. The expression profiles of the genes related to the dally-mediated pathways were then examined using quantitative RT-PCR. The rp49 gene was used as a control.

The number of S2 cells phagocytosing the pHrodo-labeled WSSV virions was quantified using flow cytometry at 1 hr after virus inoculation. The inactivated WSSV (WSSV) and non-inactivated WSSV [WSSV (live)] were included in the experiments. Non-treated S2 cell was used as a control.
