The patients were screened from 4 clinical trials (12621, 12006, FASTACT-I, and FASTACT-II), and those who received chemotherapy plus target therapy or chemotherapy alone were eligible. Among the 59 enrolled patients, 29 received combination therapy, while the other 30 received chemotherapy only. In the combination therapy group, patients with PR or SD had longer overall survival (OS) than those with PD (P , 0.001 and P 5 0.002, respectively). However, in the chemotherapy alone group, compared with PD patients, either PR or SD group had no significant overall survival benefit (P 5 0.690 and P 5 0.528, respectively). In summary, for advanced NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy plus target therapy as first-line treatment and evaluated by RECIST criteria, SD has the same overall survival benefit as PR, suggesting that antitumor effective evaluation by RECIST criteria cannot be translated to overall survival benefit especially for this kind of patients. Therefore, developing a more comprehensive evaluation method to perfect RECIST criteria is thus warranted for patients received target therapy in NSCLC.",

Appropriately 25% of NSCLC patients possess local advanced disease, and 40% have metastatic disease at initial diagnosis; systemic chemotherapy has been the main therapeutic method for these patients 1 . However, the standard cytotoxic chemotherapy of platinum-based doublet has reached the therapeutic bottleneck, with an OS of about 10 months and one-year survival rate at 35% 2 . Recent successful development of targeted therapy has greatly improved the survival of NSCLC patient population and changed the therapeutic situation to a large extent. These agents include angiogenesis inhibitors, tumor cell apoptosis inducers, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) 3,4 , which have been widely used in advanced NSCLC.",

            "text": "In clinical trials and practice using chemotherapy, RECIST has been widely used to identify and quantify the antitumor activity of new agents, providing a relatively quick assessment of efficacy. The treatment effect was usually evaluated as PR ($30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesions), PD ($20% increase in the sum of diameter of target lesion), SD (,20% increase in the sum of diameter of target lesion or ,30% decrease in them). However, many anticancer drugs especially the target agents show their main antitumor effect as slowing down or inhibiting the growth of tumor volume rather than decreasing it; Therefore, it is uncommon to observe marked shrinkage of tumor on the imaging. It has been found that the objective response rate of target agents has not always been corresponding with the clinical benefit. For example, in a phase II clinical trials assessing the efficacy of bevacizumab for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, the response was only 10-13% 8 , but the subsequent phase III clinical trial demonstrated that the PFS in bevacizumab group was significant longer than that in placebo (4.8 months vs. 2.5 months, HR 5 0.39, P , 0.001) 9 . Moreover, our previous study indicated that although SD patients showed no significant difference from PR group (P 5 0.528), the PFS (5.56 months vs. 2.03 days, P , 0.001) and OS (12.2 months vs. 7.1 months, P , 0.001) of SD1 patients were significantly shorter than those of SD-/0 patients 10 . Hence, many specialists recommended the disease control rate (DCR), rather than response rate for clinical evaluation of target agent in research. However, there is still lack of special study on the assessment of combination of target therapy and chemotherapy.",

Among the total 59 patients evaluated, PR and SD groups had similar PFS and OS, which was consistent with the population receiving combination therapy. Based on this, our research firstly analyzed the correlation between objective response and survival after combination treatment of chemotherapy with target therapy. Target therapy aims to inhibit the growth of tumor, which is different from the killing-effect of cytotoxic drugs. The moleculartargeted therapies available for lung cancer are more likely to result in SD than to produce tumor regression. Our previous study 10 reported EGFR-TKI for advanced NSCLC, with survival benefit observed in patients with tumor stabilization. Kurata et al. 11 demonstrated that 1% increase in DCR would prolong the survival time by 0.0375 months in advanced NSCLC patients receiving EGFR-TKI as second-line therapy. About 67% phase II and phase III clinical trials for target therapy take DCR (CR 1 PR 1 SD), other than objective response rate, as primary objective 12 . We also found the same results in the chemo and target therapy queue, SD patients had no difference with PR patients in OS (P 5 0.440) and PFS (P 5 0.111). However, both PR and SD patients had better survival benefit than PD patients (P , 0.001 and P 5 0.028, respectively), indicating that the SD patients also obtained survival benefit from the combination of chemo and target therapy or target therapy only. This information suggested that DCR may be a better endpoint than response rate in this kind of clinical study, to avoid missing a good antitumor drug. Moreover, better criteria should be explored in the evaluation of combination of target and chemotherapy.",

All patients in this group had received chemotherapy, which enhanced the killing effect on tumor cells to certain extent. In terms of the killing-effect of chemotherapy, in the 22 patients evaluated with SD, only 1 patient had slight tumor enlargement, while the other 21 had tumor regression, which is different from the result of our previous report that 13 out of the 40 patients in SD group had slight tumor enlargement 10 . The median survival of chemotherapy group was 14.1 months, much longer than the result of other studies, possibly due to a subsequent treatment.  At present, OS is considered to be the most important indicator of clinical efficacy endpoints for therapy regimen, but it requires prolonged follow-up and is often affected significantly by other factors, such as subsequent treatment. Therefore, OS may lead to either a waste of the medical resources or a loss of the benefit from maintained therapy. Therefore, a more effective parameter is needed to guide the choice of treatment during the course of disease. In oncology, change in tumor size is linked to survival in some solid tumors. Bruno et al. suggested that change in tumor size can be used as a primary endpoint in the design and evaluation of phase II studies and in supporting go/no-go decisions and phase III study design 16 . Kris also indicated that any increase or decrease of tumor size should be taken as a surrogate endpoint for efficacy 17 . Many analyses showed that the change of tumor size was an independent prognostic factor. We also found that SD patients with tumor regression had significant survival benefit. He et al. suggested that initial PR and SD patients with advanced NSCLC enjoy similar PFS and OS 18 . These results suggest that response rate may be not a suitable indicator to define the evaluation of antitumor treatment.",

However, after 20 years of practice, we found that the criteria remained to be improved. The measurable, evaluable lesions were not defined, and estimating the tumor size by the product of the longest diameter and its vertical length caused inaccuracy of the result. Thus the EORTC, NCI, and NCIC put forward the RECIST, which was also based on the morphological features of tumor, but used the unidimensional lesion measurement, defining both the measurable lesions and the number of target lesions, making a great progress when compared to the WHO criteria 19,20 . Therefore, in both clinical trials and practice, the RECIST became a standard for evaluation of efficacy. However, limitations remained in RECIST criteria, which is especially true when dealing with the targeted therapy. Ours and several other studies have verified that patients with SD have been also benefited from the continuation of the original treatment 17 .",

Moreover, when compared with PD group, patients with disease control (PR 1 SD) had longer survival. However, in the chemotherapy alone group, there was no significant difference between disease control group and PD group. These findings indicated that RECIST criteria may not reflect the change of tumor cell viability timely to  fully reliably predict patient's prognosis, especially for advanced NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy plus target therapy as first-line treatment. Therefore, a more comprehensive evaluation method is thus needed to evaluate therapeutic efficacy in this population. Prospective randomized studies with advanced NSCLC patients are required to further validate the present results.",
