            "text": "Involvement of the left ventricular anterior wall in ST-elevation myocardial infarction has a worse prognosis compared with other regions. In non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, noninvasive methods of locating the ischemic myocardial territory have been limited. The objective of this report is therefore to determine what factors are predictive of the anterior location of the ischemic myocardial territory. METHODS: This study included 170 patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Clinical, echocardiographic, and laboratory characteristics, including B-type natriuretic peptide measured within 24 hours of hospitalization, and coronary angiographic features were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age was 64.5 \u00a1 12.3 years, and 112 of the patients were male (66%). The median follow-up was 23 months. The territory involved, as determined from the angiogram, was divided into anterior [n = 80 (47%)] regions and inferior and lateral [n = 90 (53%)] regions. Multivariate analysis showed that B-type natriuretic peptide was the only independent predictor of an anterior wall infarct [OR = 3.70 (95% CI: 1.61-8.53); P = 0.002] in non-STelevation myocardial infarction patients. Multivariate analysis also showed that B-type natriuretic peptide was an independent predictor of in-hospital cardiac events during index admission [OR = 5.05 (95% CI: 1.49-17.12); P = 0.009] and of cardiac events occurring during follow-up [HR = 1.79 (95% CI: 1.05-3.04); P = 0.032]. CONCLUSIONS: B-type natriuretic peptide was the only factor independently associated with anterior wall involvement in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and the peptide levels upon admission predicted in-hospital and subsequent cardiac events."

            "text": "Previous studies 1,2 have shown that involvement of the left ventricular (LV) anterior wall in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has a worse prognosis compared with involvement of other regions. STEMI of the anterior wall is associated with a larger infarction area, as determined by the enzyme peak and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), in comparison with other walls. 3 Also, the electrocardiogram (ECG) in STEMI is usually sufficient to diagnose which wall is affected. 4 The importance of the involvement of the anterior wall in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) has not been widely studied. In NSTEMI, the identification of involvement of the anterior wall on admission is not as obvious as in STEMI. Because anterior wall infarction may be associated with a poor prognosis, several studies [5][6][7][8] have been conducted to identify the ischemic LV wall in NSTEMI. These studies have used ECG to identify which wall was affected. However, ECG has limited ability to perform this function in NSTEMI because approximately 50% of patients have a normal or inconclusive pattern. 9 Other methods, such as stress echocardiography 10 and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, 11 can locate the infarction site in NSTEMI patients, but both methods demand more complex health services and higher costs. However, in a recent report by Sadanandan et al. 12 of patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI, coronary angiography showed an association between BNP levels and involvement of the anterior descending coronary artery.",

Variables associated with wall location and events in univariate analysis (P , 0.10) were included in the multivariate analyses.

A multiple logistic regression model was used for the selection of variables predictive of involvement of the anterior wall and for the occurrence of in-hospital events during index admission. Cox multivariate regression was used for the selection of independent prognostic factors of mortality and any follow-up events. Two-sided P values , 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Previous studies 5,6,17 have evaluated the location of the LV anterior wall in NSTEMI in relation to the prognosis, with most using ECG to identify the affected wall. For example, using electrocardiographic ST-segment and T-wave changes to categorize the patients, Kao et al. 5 studied 135 patients with NSTEMI and observed a higher rate of reinfarction and death in patients with involvement of the anterior wall in  comparison with the inferior and lateral walls. In addition, Schechtman et al. 17 analyzed data from 544 patients with NSTEMI, excluding patients in Killip class IV. Using ECG to categorize the infarct location, they identified 51% of patients as having anterior wall ischemia and did not find higher mortality in these patients compared with those who had ischemia of the inferior or lateral walls. They did not locate the wall affected in 20% of their patients. Compared with these studies, the infarct location was not categorized in a greater number of patients in the present study. This may be due to our use of the new definition of NSTEMI, which includes a smaller area of infarct or ischemia that may have a smaller representation on ECG. The presence of other factors, such as previous MI, cardiac surgery, or left bundle-branch block, can also influence the accuracy of ECG.",
