Materials and Methods: A total of 100 practicing general dentists were randomly chosen as per the list of practitioners available to local state association. The questionnaire was designed to cover general information of the participating dentist and concerning different aspects of devitalizing agents. The collected data was subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 17.0 (IBM Statistics, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Descriptive statistics was drawn with respective percentages to have a comparative overview. Results: The response rate was 97%, of which the effective and complete replies received were 77% (75). 56% respondents used paraformaldehyde containing pastes. Majority of general practitioners (61%) did not observe any post-operative complication following the use of devitalising agent. 33% (25) of the respondents were not aware of the complications of devitalizing agents. Conclusion: Thus, it can be concluded that general dental practitioners in Pune and Nashik district of Maharashtra, India do use pulp devitalizing agents in spite of possessing knowledge related to the complications.",

            "text": "Pain is an integral part of human pathosis. However, its intensity, nature, type, duration, and progress differ with the degree of pathology. Amongst the pain off hand reported by a majority of the population, one of the frequent is dental pain with higher intensity as comparable to other types of pain in account. 1 Etiological rationale for dental pain stands mostly for endodontic, periodontal or a combination. Dental caries sought as a common disease only second to common cold forms one of the bases for endodontic problems thereby leading to pain following extensive involvement. 2 Pulpal inflammation as the sequel of dental caries figures a significant component of endodontic diseases. Many general dental practitioners find management of the inflamed pulp challenging in their routine dental practice. To handle such challenges, clinicians use devitalizing agents where dental anesthesia fails to be effective. The devitalizing agents compose of formaldehyde, cresol, paraformaldehyde, and arsenic compounds. These agents are delineated as harmful to the patients posing facts being highly toxic, allergic, carcinogenic and mutagenic/genotoxic. 3,4 In addition, there are reported cases that support the verity and proves the detrimental effects of agents. The reports range from gingival to the alveolar necrosis. [5][6][7] In spite of the disadvantages noted, general dental clinicians are seen to use these products in their routine practice as per published literature from few countries. 8,9 With the advent of information being available at fingertips in today's era due to the accessibility of data on internet and online databases, it is very easy for a clinicians to keep themselves updated with the current concepts. Thus, it can be hypothesized that general dental practitioners are benefitting to update their knowledge with current technology in hand. The same also applies with updating of knowledge in respect to devitalizing agents since it forms a major part of dental practice. However, there is no latest reported literature available, which speaks about the behavior of general dental practitioners in relation to devitalizing agents considering the hypothesis aforementioned.",

The use of aldehyde containing agents was  more in the present study than other studies where they have used the recently available devitalizing agents like arsenic based compounds. This could be rationalized on the basis of dental education sought by the practitioners. Although, majority of practitioners belong to practice group of 1-5 years, the same could have confounding factors with respect to their education pursued till establishment of practice. The elimination of same was not possible within the aegis of the study. The reasons reported by the practitioners for use of agents as fore-stated is probably due to the fact that these agents are perceived to be quick and painless in action, eliminating the necessity of administration of local anesthesia thus saving time and maximising patient cooperation. For pediatric patients, reasons for use of such agents were the difficulty they face in managing behavior of a child in administering local anesthesia. This projects the use of devitalizing agents overruled the importance of local anesthesia in endodontic treatment.",
