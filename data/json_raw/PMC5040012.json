            "text": "Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) remains a major health problem worldwide. Several clinical trials have shown the superiority of the Traditional Chinese Medicine in delaying or reversing the development and progression of DM. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Jinlida (JLD) granule, a Chinese herbal recipe, in the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and its effect on the prevention of DM. Methods: Sixty-five IGT patients were randomized to receive one bag of JLD granules three times daily (JLD group, n = 34) or no drug intervention (control group, n = 31) for 12 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance test, glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c), body mass index, blood lipids levels, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance calculated using homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) of all the patients were observed and compared before and after the treatment. Results: Sixty-one participants completed the trial (32 in JLD group and 29 in the control group). There were statistically significant decreases in HbA 1c (P < 0.001), 2-h plasma glucose (P < 0.001), and HOMA-IR (P = 0.029) in JLD group compared with the control group after 12 weeks of treatment. After 12 weeks of treatment, two (6.9%) patients returned to normal blood glucose, and five (17.2%) patients turned into DM in control group, while in the JLD group, 14 (43.8%) returned to normal blood glucose and 2 (6.2%) turned into DM. There was a significant difference in the number of subjects who had normal glucose at the end of the study between two groups (P = 0.001). Conclusions: JLD granule effectively improved glucose control, increased the conversion of IGT to normal glucose, and improved the insulin resistance in patients with IGT. This Chinese herbal medicine may have a clinical value for IGT.",

            "text": "Type 2 diabetes is a growing public health challenge globally. In the year 2013, 382 million people had diabetes mellitus (DM), this number is expected to rise to 592 million by the year 2035. [1] An even larger segment of the world's population has impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). [2] IGT, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, [3,4] is characterized by an increase in the postprandial glucose levels [5] and considered as an intermediate metabolic state between normal blood glucose and DM. The overall prevalence of DM is estimated to be 11.6% in the Chinese adult population according to the recent national survey. [6] Some studies have discovered that about 5-10% of IGT will develop into DM within one year. [7] IGT could be reversed to normal blood glucose by timely and effective intervention. Therefore, effective interventions for patients with IGT are necessary, which can prevent and delay the development of DM. Several studies have shown that lifestyle or pharmacological therapy could delay the development of DM in patients with IGT, [8][9][10] and clinical research has shown the superiority of the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in this field. [11][12][13] Jinlida (JLD) granule, a TCM, is an herbal formula developed under the theory that Pi (Spleen)-deficiency appears in the onset of DM. By nourishing Pi and regulating body fluid of DM subjects, JLD granule was used for diabetes management with positive data from the animal and human studies. [14][15][16][17][18] However, the efficacy of JLD granule in the treatment of IGT patients and its effect on the prevention of DM have never been observed. This study therefore was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JLD granule for the IGT treatment and prevention of DM.",

However, lifestyle intervention is impractical to some extent as it could hardly be carried out by patients to achieve satisfactory improvement. There are also many disadvantages of the Western medicine listed above, such as costly price and AEs. In this field, TCM has been used in the prevention of diabetes and showed certain superiority. [11,12,[31][32][33][34] Several clinical trials have revealed that JLD granule can control blood glucose levels and have systemic benefits in patients with diabetes. [14][15][16][17][18] In an early clinical observational study of 186 patients with T2DM ineffectively managed by metformin monotherapy, 12 weeks of JLD granule treatment as add-on medication decreased HbA 1c by 0.92 \u00b11.09% and reduced FPG and 2-h PG levels. [18] Elevated HbA 1c levels that integrated PG overtime was now validated as another indicator of IGT. [5] Our study showed that patients in JLD group had significantly reduced FPG, 2-h PG, and HbA 1c after 12 weeks of treatment, and the levels of 2-h PG and HbA 1c were very significantly different between two groups after 12 weeks of treatment.

Many components of JLD granule, such as ginsenosides, puerarin, and C. chinensis, have been demonstrated to have a hypoglycemic effect. [37][38][39] Besides, Wang et al. [40] supposed that the mechanism underlying the antihyperglycemic effect of JLD granule might be associated with its protection of pancreatic \u03b2-cells through AMP-activated protein kinase activation. In the current study, no obvious AEs occurred, which suggested that this herbal drug was safe to use. Although the results of our study need to be confirmed by larger and longer clinical trials in the future, JLD granule had promising potential as an effective means in slowing the progression of IGT to T2DM.",
