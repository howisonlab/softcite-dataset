Recently, it has been shown that non-ER CRT regulates a wide array of cellular responses. We previously found that CRT was up-regulated during hypoxia/ reoxygenation (H/R) and this study was aimed to investigate whether CRT nuclear translocation aggravates ER stress (ERS)-associated apoptosis during H/R injury in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Methods: Apoptosis rate and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage in culture medium were measured as indices of cell injury. Immunofluorescence staining showed the morphological changes of ER and intracellular translocation of CRT. Western blotting or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of target molecules. Results: Compared with control, H/R increased apoptosis rate and LDH activity. The ER became condensed and bubbled, and CRT translocated to the nucleus. Western blotting showed up-regulation of CRT, Nrf2, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), CHOP and caspase-12 expression after H/R. Exogenous CRT overexpression induced by plasmid transfection before H/R increased cell apoptosis, LDH leakage, ER disorder, CRT nuclear translocation and the expression of ERS-associated molecules. However, administration of the ERS inhibitor, taurine, or CRT siRNA alleviated cell injury, ER disorder, and inhibited ERS-associated apoptosis. Conclusions: Our results indicated that during H/R stress, CRT translocation increases cell apoptosis and LDH leakage, aggravates ER disorder, up-regulates expression of nuclear transcription factors, Nrf2 and ATF4, and activates ERS-associated apoptosis.",

            "text": "Calreticulin (CRT) is a major calcium-binding chaperone that is highly concentrated in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is vital to the regulation of protein folding and Ca 2+ homeostasis in the ER. [1] Recent studies have shown that non-ER CRT located in the cytosol, cell membrane, and extracellular matrix, regulates a wide array of cellular responses, such as adhesion, migration, apoptosis, phagocytosis, and immunoregulation. [2] Calreticulin is essential for embryonic cardiac development with the absence being embryonically lethal. [3] After birth, CRT expression in the myocardium decreases; however, during cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, CRT expression is increased. [4] This profile suggests that CRT may play an important role in the generation of postnatal/adult cardiac pathology.",

Moderate expression of CRT induced by HPC can protect cardiomyocytes from oxidative damage, whereas CRT overexpression induced by H/R induces myocardial damage. Notably, there is a positive correlation between the amount of CRT and the cytoplasm calcium ion concentration. [5] The signaling cascades responsible for this CRT dichotomy have not yet been elucidated. It has been shown that either oxidative damage or a posttranslational modification of CRT can affect both its function and subcellular localization.

[14] The ER is an important sub-cellular organelle for protein folding, lipid synthesis, and calcium storage. Disturbance of ER homeostasis results in ERS, acting as a mediator between survival and apoptosis. This study demonstrates that CRT, a major ER Ca 2+ binding chaperone with multiple functions, translocates from the ER to the other parts of the cell during cardiomyocyte H/R, promotes ER dysfunction, and induces ERS-associated apoptosis.

            "text": "Calreticulin has long been known as an ER luminal protein, and previous reports mainly focused on its function as a calcium binding chaperone, regulating intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis and protein folding. However, it is difficult to explain the controversial effects of CRT during apoptosis induced by ischemia, hypoxia or oxidative stress in different cell types. In recent years, it has been found that CRT has multiple functions in the other intracellular compartments, cell surface, and extracellular matrix. [2,6] Agents that directly lower ER Ca 2+ levels can induce the rapid translocation of presynthesized CRT from the ER. [6] Once CRT translocates to the cytosol, it can be posttranslationally modified by arginyl transferase, which attaches an arginine residue to the N-terminal aspartic acid residue of the protein and localizes CRT to cytoplasmic stress granules. [15] It has also been reported that CRT can bind to the KxGFFKR sequence of many nuclear transcription factors, such as glucocorticoid receptor, regulating gene transcription. [16] Cardiomyocytes over-expressing CRT exhibit increased intracellular calcium as well as either an expression or activity of pro-apoptotic factors such as Bax, p53, caspase-8 and caspase-3, together with reduced antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2. [17] The direct inhibition of CRT overexpression induced by either I/R or H/R injury through the endogenous protective phenomena such as IPC or hypoxic preconditioning (HPC), alleviates cardiomyocyte apoptosis, [5] inhibits caspase-12 activation in vitro, limits myocardial infarct size, improves heart function in vivo, and is consistent with its effect in rat skeletal muscle cells. [18] Recently, we found that CRT inhibition by antisense oligonucleotides weakened hypoxic postconditioning protection, and at the same time, attenuated H/R injury. [5] Based on previous studies, this work focused on the changes of CRT subcellular localization induced by H/R and its effect on ERS-associated apoptosis. We further hypothesized that H/R injury may up-regulate CRT expression and affect its subcellular localization. Other than This study showed that hypoxia re-oxygenation increased cell apoptosis and the permeability of the cell membrane, the appearance of ER condensation, and the bubbling phenomena. Along with the nuclear translocation of CRT, the expression of transcription factors such as Nrf2 [19] and ATF4 in nuclear extracts also increased. The expression of ER-associated apoptosis markers, such as CHOP and caspase-12 increased, and the expression ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax decreased. Exogenous CRT overexpression aggravated cardiomyocyte H/R injury, causing cell apoptosis, and an increase in necrosis rate and cell membrane permeability. Additionally, the activity of LDH in the culture medium was increased, and ER morphology injury was aggravated. The nuclear translocation of CRT and the activation of ERS-associated apoptosis pathway further increased. There was a positive correlation between the over-expression of CRT induced by H/R and the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic molecules such as CHOP and caspase-12 associated with ERS. Taurine is a conditionally essential amino acid, which is high in the myocardium (10-40 mmol/L), playing cytoprotective role, including calcium modulation, membrane stabilization, osmoregulation, antioxidation, protein phosphorylation, and ion flux. Our previous work has confirmed that taurine inhibits ERS in the myocardium, [20] and in our in vitro experiment we used 40 mmol/L of taurine as an ERS inhibitor according to the dose reported in the literature. [21] This work showed that taurine and CRT siRNA interference both attenuated injuries induced by H/R, showing reversed damages to ER structure, decreased CRT distribution in ER and nucleus, and the expression of pro-apoptotic molecules. When ERS is overactive, as a multifunctional protein, CRT may retro-translocate to the other parts of the cell and no longer play a protective role, promoting ER dysfunction and participating in the activation of the ERS-associated apoptosis cascade. H/R induced CRT over-expression and translocation, aggravating ER dysfunction and activating the ERS-associated apoptosis pathway to enhance cardiomyocyte damage.",

Over the past decade, CRT has also been implicated into a variety of processes that occur outside of the ER lumen. From the results of the study, we speculated that CRT nuclear translocation might regulate the transcriptional activities of nuclear transcription factors such as Nrf2 and ATF4, affecting the transcription and translation of ERS-associated proteins and causing ER damage and subsequent apoptosis. references",

Along with the translocation of CRT from ER to nucleus, the expression of transcription factors such as Nrf2 and ATF4 in nuclear extracts increased [Figure 3a and 3b compared with control] (P < 0.05). H/R notably up-regulated the specific ERS markers, such as GRP78, CHOP and caspase-12 [Figure 4] (P < 0.05). It suggested that H/R induces ERS. Among these markers, GRP78 is a protective molecule and CRT overexpression, siRNA interference and taurine had no obvious effects on the up-regulation of GRP78 induced by H/R [Figure 4b] (P > 0.05). With regard to the pro-apoptotic molecules such as CHOP and caspase-12, CRT over-expression increased their expressions to a higher degree [Figure 4b] (P < 0.05); however, taurine administration and CRT siRNA interference decreased the expression of CHOP and caspase-12 [Figure 4b] (P < 0.05). CRT overexpression aggravated the apoptosis-promoting effect of H/R associated with ERS, while taurine and CRT siRNA alleviated ERS-associated apoptosis. In regard to general apoptosis-associated markers [Figure 5a], H/R up-regulated the pro-apoptotic molecules caspase-3 and Bax, while down-regulated the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 [Figure 5b] (P < 0.05). CRT over-expression exacerbated the H/R effect, and the expression of caspase-3 and Bax increased while Bcl-2 expression decreased [Figure 5b] (P < 0.05). Taurine and CRT siRNA inhibited the up-regulation of caspase-3 and Bax, and the down-regulation of Bcl-2 [Figure 5b] (P < 0.05), indicating that these treatments relieved apoptosis induced by H/R.",

During the resting state, the endoplasmic reticulum displayed a homogeneous faint green fluorescence, distributed around the nuclei. The red fluorescence representing CRT was mainly co-localized with concanavalin A, showing weak intensity in the nuclear area. After hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), the green fluorescence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) became condensed, grainy and bubbled. The fluorescence intensity of CRT increased, no longer overlapped with concanavalin A, and the low fluorescence area of the nuclei disappeared, suggesting that CRT translocated from ER to the nuclei. CRT overexpression aggravated the structural disorder of ER, and the CRT nuclear translocation became obvious. RNA interference knockeddown the total expression of CRT and the phenomena of ER bubbling and CRT nuclear translocation eventually decreased. The control plasmid (pCDB) or negative control siRNA (si-neg) transfection had no effect on ER disorder and CRT re-distribution induced by H/R.

Either brief ischemic or hypoxic stress lead to the induction of CRT as an ER chaperone, and further succeeds in re-establishing ER homeostasis, while prolonged ischemia or hypoxia may induce CRT overexpression and translocation from the ER to the cytosol and disturb the anti-and pro-apoptotic balance of unfolded protein response, leading to an apoptotic fate.",
