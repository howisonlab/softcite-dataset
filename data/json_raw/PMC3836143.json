Cross-sectional evidence indicates an inverse association among biomarkers of F&V intake, carotenoid and vitamin C status, fasting plasma glucose concentrations (4), fasting serum insulin concentrations (5), HbA 1c levels (6), and fasting and 2-h blood glucose levels (6). Furthermore, whole diet interventions using diets rich in F&Vs, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet (7,8) and the Mediterranean diet (9,10), have been shown to have beneficial effects on IR, features of the metabolic syndrome, and prevention of diabetes. Esposito et al. (9) reported a significant decrease in IR (assessed by homeostatic model assessment [HOMA]), and a reduction in the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, after a 2-year Mediterranean-style diet intervention in 180 patients with the metabolic syndrome. Evidence from observational studies and whole diet interventions rich in F&Vs therefore suggests that F&Vs may have a positive influence on IR and metabolic health. The low energy density and high dietary fiber, antioxidant, and bioactive content of F&Vs, and their potential to displace less desirable foods from the diet, have all been proposed as potential mediators of this association between F&Vs and IR (11).",

Serum concentrations of lutein, zeaxanthin, b-cryptoxanthin, a-carotene, b-carotene, and lycopene were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection, as described by Craft et al. (21). Assays were standardized against appropriate National Institute of Standards and Technology control materials. The fasting serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides) was assessed using enzymatic colorimetric assays (Roche Diagnostics Limited, West Sussex, U.K.) on the ILab-600 biochemical analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Warrington, U.K.). LDL cholesterol was calculated using a standard Friedewald equation (22). Plasma adiponectin (total, high-molecular weight, medium-molecular weight, and lowmolecular weight) were measured by ELISA (ALPCO diagnostics); low-molecular weight adiponectin was obtained by subtracting the combined concentration of medium-molecular weight and highmolecular weight adiponectin (measured directly) from the total adiponectin concentration. Serum insulin levels were measured by ELISA (Abbot IMx; Abbott Laboratories, Berkshire, U.K.). Plasma glucose levels were measured using an automated glucose oxidase method using a Beckman Glucose Analyzer 2. Fasting glucose and insulin levels were used to calculate the HOMA score (23). Commercial kits were used to measure C-peptide (Dako UK Ltd, Ely, U.K.) and nonesterified fatty acids (Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany) on the ILab-600 biochemical analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory).",

One-way ANOVA with linear trend test was used to examine differences in mean change (i.e., preintervention value minus postintervention value for a given continuous variable) between groups for the primary and secondary end points. Post hoc analyses were performed using the Dunnett test comparing the control group (one to two portions) with the intervention groups (four and seven portions). For each variable, intervention analysis was performed for all participants who had completed the study protocol according to randomization group. The test for linear trend (with changes in variable and portion allocation as the dependent and independent variables, respectively), analogous to linear regression, was incorporated in order to take account of the dose-response design. Variables that were not normally distributed were log-transformed prior to these analyses.

Recently, data regarding the precise nature of their biological effects have started to emerge from RCTs (24). Such studies in both healthy and clinical groups are important in order to inform public health messages and evidence-based clinical practice. The RCT described here is the first to examine the cause-effect plausibility of a dose-response relationship between F&V consumption and IR, assessed using the comprehensive glucose clamp technique, in people at high risk of CVD. Despite objective evidence of compliance with the intervention, increased F&V intake did not have a statistically significant effect on whole-body, peripheral, or hepatic IR or concentrations of adiponectin multimers. A favorable effect on microvascular function, assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography, has recently been demonstrated in another dose-response F&V intervention study (24). There is a recognized reciprocal relationship between IR and endothelial dysfunction (25), and it could be hypothesized that the beneficial effects of F&V on vascular function may be mediated by improvements in IR. The results of this RCT do not support this notion; furthermore, the change in vascular function in the aforementioned study did not correlate with the change in HOMA (26). Taken together, these results indicate that the beneficial effects of F&Vs in relation to cardiovascular health are not likely to be directly mediated by IR.",

In order to minimize confounding and allow the specific effect of these whole foods to be studied, this study protocol aimed to increase F&V intake while maintaining body weight, and this was achieved with no difference among groups in change in body weight. The lack of improvement in IR after increased F&V intake lends support to the idea that weight loss may be more important than dietary composition in terms of influencing IR. It is possible that, independent of potential effects on body weight, F&Vs may not have a direct effect on the risk of type 2 diabetes (29). However, it is also possible that F&Vs may have subtle effects on IR, which are only detectable in a normalweight insulin-resistant group, or in overweight or obese populations after substantial weight loss has occurred. Moreover, although this study was conducted in a population at high risk of CVD, the majority of participants did not have impaired fasting glucose levels, and the effects may be different in a group of participants with prediabetes.",

In this study, participants maintained their body weight, and this will have meant that they were substituting F&Vs for other foods in the diet rather than adding F&Vs to their usual dietary intake. The examination of overall dietary intake at weeks 4 and 16 indicated that the incorporation of F&Vs into the diet in increasing amounts was associated with a statistically significant linear decrease in fat intake and a statistically significant linear increase in total carbohydrate, sugar, and fiber intake amounts. F&Vs are high in fiber, and fruit contains natural sugars; hence, these dietary changes were expected. The reduction in fat intake was modest, and it is possible that the potential benefits of fat displacement on IR may have been negated by a more notable increase in sugar intake. However, our previous research does not indicate that sugar intake at these levels has a detrimental effect on IR (15). The stipulation to maintain weight during the study was implemented in order to minimize confounding and to allow the direct effects of F&V intake on IR to be studied. However, it means that this study cannot address the possibility that the incorporation of F&Vs into the diet when no restrictions are placed on weight status may have a more pronounced effect on overall dietary profile, which, in turn, may affect IR. Furthermore, findings from whole diet interventions support the notion that a combination of broad dietary changes may be an optimal approach (7-10). Furthermore, in order to be consistent with public health advice about F&Vs, this study did not restrict the types of F&Vs consumed, and participants were allowed a free choice as would happen in a real-life setting. Thus, a more prescriptive intervention that controls the types of F&Vs more tightly and minimizes within-group variation in chemical composition may provide a different answer. Indeed, it has recently emerged from the literature that the type of fruit or vegetable may be important when it comes to influencing the risk of type 2 diabetes. A recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies suggested that an increase of 1.15 servings a day of darkgreen leafy vegetables is associated with a 14% reduction in the risk of type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 0.86 [95% CI 0.77-0.97]) compared with only a trend toward a 7% reduction in risk for fruit intake (hazard ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.83-1.01]) (30). However, this suggestion is based on a limited number of studies that were heterogeneous in their reporting of the data (some reported F&Vs separately and combined, others only reported F&Vs separately; there was also heterogeneity among studies in how \"green leafy vegetables\" were defined). A further, similar, meta-analysis published in 2012 (31) included data from the EPIC-InterAct prospective study and reported estimates similar to those of Carter et al. (30)  ; however, this association was not evident in two other studies in the metaanalysis that examined this vegetable subgroup (32,33). Alongside these data, a recent report from the prospective Nurses Health and Health Professionals Follow-Up Studies reported a lower risk of type 2 diabetes with higher intakes of anthocyaninrich foods, particularly blueberries and apples/pears (34).",

Findings from a recent nested case-control study of the EPIC-Norfolk cohort have indicated that both total quantity of F&Vs and F&V variety (at least 12 different F&V items per week) are inversely and independently associated with risk of type 2 diabetes (11). It is possible that, although participants in this study were encouraged to eat a variety of F&Vs, in line with government advice, they did not achieve sufficient variety in their intake to influence metabolism. With regard to the idea that vegetables may have a greater effect on IR and diabetes risk, an examination of the contribution of fruit to total F&V intake in this study found that the percentage contribution made by fruit increased significantly across groups during the intervention (fruit intake comprised ;43% of total F&V intake for the group receiving two portions per day, rising to 64 and 69%, respectively, for the groups receiving four and seven portions per day). However, it was not possible to examine the response to intervention according to those who ate more fruit compared with those who Week 16",

With regard to the increase in fruit intake, it is important to note that, in line with current public health advice, participants were informed that fruit or vegetable juice could only count as one of their F&V portions daily, and so they were advised to limit their juice consumption accordingly and to increase their intake of F&Vs by consuming the intact food rather than relying on fruit or vegetable juice to boost their intake. Adherence to this advice was evident in the participant food diaries, and there were no high juice consumers in the study. As discussed above, because this study did not restrict the types or proportions of F&Vs consumed, there were significant differences among groups in change in sugar intake, and other factors such as glycemic index and glycemic load are also likely to have changed, although this has not been formally examined. Again, a more prescriptive intervention controlling for such variables may provide a different answer to the one found here. Because this study did not control for the type of F&V or the relative proportion of fruit versus vegetables to be consumed by participants, it cannot answer questions regarding the appropriateness of more specific guidance on F&V intake; rather, this study examined the implementation of the general message promoted in the U.K. and the U.S. to eat a variety of F&Vs each day, generally aiming for at least five servings a day. It is interesting to note that public health guidance in Australia advocates a twofruit-plus-five-vegetable approach in their guidance to consumers (35). It is likely that public health advice in other countries may, similarly, evolve over time to become more specific. However, there are a limited number of studies to date regarding the importance of F&V variety for health outcomes or examining the specific health effects of fruit versus vegetables (36). Apart from the current study, to our knowledge, no other study to date has specifically examined the effect of whole F&Vs on IR using the gold standard clamp methodology. A recent doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 32 obese, insulin-resistant men and women found that intake of 22.5 g of blueberry bioactives twice daily for 6 weeks enhanced insulin sensitivity, which was assessed using high-dose euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, compared with placebo, perhaps suggesting that the form in which F&Vs are consumed may be important in terms of antidiabetic effects (37). The latter study, however, does not help to inform public health messages about F&V consumption inasmuch as a freeze-dried blueberry powder was used rather than the whole food or juice. Allowing volunteers to make their own dietary choices, as was applied in this protocol, is closer to the current real-life scenario where people receive general advice to \"eat more F&Vs.\" A threshold effect beyond the maximum portion allocation used here (seven portions per day) is unlikely based on the existing literature (11) but cannot be excluded. However, even if such a threshold exists, an intake higher than seven portions per day would be unattainable for the vast majority of the population.",

This change in self-reported F&V intake was mirrored by a statistically significant dose-response increase in lutein status with increasing F&V intake and a trend for increasing vitamin C and b-carotene status, thus confirming that the volunteers did increase their F&V intake in a stepwise manner across groups. As indicated in our recent systematic review on this topic (38), a panel of biomarkers (notably aand b-carotene, vitamin C, lutein, zeaxanthin, and b-cryptoxanthin) should be measured as indicators of compliance in F&V intervention trials. The specific biomarker changes encountered will vary among studies that use a mixed F&V intervention, owing to differences in F&V selection when free choice is permitted.",
