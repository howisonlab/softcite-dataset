EPP 2009 required modifications to correctly adjust for the effects of ART on incidence and the resulting increases in HIV prevalence in populations with high ART coverage. Because changing incidence is a better indicator of program impact, the 2009 series of UNAIDS tools also focuses on calculating incidence alongside prevalence. Other changes made in EPP 2009 include: an improved procedure, incremental mixture importance sampling, for efficiently generating more accurate uncertainty estimates; provisions to vary the urban/rural population ratios in generalised epidemics over time; introduction of a modified epidemic model that accommodates behaviour change in low incidence settings; and improved procedures for calibrating models. This paper describes these changes in detail, and discusses anticipated future changes in the next version of EPP.",

            "text": "The most significant change in the global response to HIV has been the rapid expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) using drug combinations in developing countries. Since WHO and UNAIDS launched the '3 by 5' strategy in 2003, 1 the number of people on ART has grown to exceed 4 million people by the end of 2008. 2 High levels of ART in many countries are now having a major impact on HIV prevalence. Because survival of individuals on ART is greatly prolonged, HIV prevalence in the population as a whole will be higher than in the absence of ART. These increased prevalence effects are often reflected in surveillance data which the UNAIDS Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) fits to the model developed by the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling and Projections (hereafter, the Reference Group model). 3e6 EPP has been used extensively for modelling national epidemics. 7e10 The EPP model must incorporate these effects of ART on prevalence before fitting to the data. High levels of ART can also lower the HIV incidence for a given prevalence level through decreases in viral load reducing individuals' infectiousness. To respond to both sets of treatment-related effects, EPP 2009 now uses a modified Reference Group model that includes the impacts of ART on prevalence and incidence.",

However, a number of problems have been identified with the reliance on prevalence as an indicator for analysing the impact of HIV programs. During the early phases of an epidemic prevalence grows rapidly, but changes in the slope due to saturation and to program impact are difficult to separate. After several years HIV prevalence tends to plateau, with new infections and deaths balancing each other out. An effective program introduced as this plateau phase begins may induce a gradual decline in prevalence, but this decline may be difficult to distinguish from mortality-related declines. Several years ago, the global epidemic entered a plateau phase, with most countries in sub-Saharan Africadwhere the majority of people living with HIV residedshowing stable or only slowly declining HIV prevalence. As a result, in 2007 UNAIDS began to focus more attention on new infections, that is, incidence, as a more informative measure of global progress. 11 In response, the UNAIDS Reference Group recommended that the tools UNAIDS prepares to assist countries in analysing their epidemics, EPP and Spectrum, shift to a focus on incidence. 12 This change was made in the 2009 version of the software, which still fits prevalence data, but provides incidence from the model along with prevalence as outputs. Because incidence is derived by fitting prevalence, it reflects an averaged national trend in new infections and may not capture short-term rises and falls in incidence occurring in specific groups or geographical areas.",

EPP 2007's uncertainty estimation procedures evaluated 50 000e200 000 sets of Reference Group model parameters for their fit to the observed prevalence data, normally selecting out 50 or more that were close to the data (described in Brown et al 5 and Alkema et al 13 ). In a few countries, the defaults set in the uncertainty procedures produced relatively few unique curves, leading to inaccurate estimation of uncertainty. A new procedure, incremental mixture importance sampling (IMIS), has been introduced to solve this problem. In many African countries the population has been rapidly shifting from rural to urban areas, but earlier versions of EPP assumed fixed urban and rural population sizes. 12 EPP 2009 now allows the urban/rural proportions to vary over time. In a small number of countries, fits to the data in EPP 2007 produced zero incidence within a few years, a situation which has never been observed in any country. A modified Reference Group model was developed for use in these countries. Finally, user interface changes were introduced to allow user input of the data needed for ART calculations, improve overall calibration procedures, and support the shift to an incidence basis.",

People living with HIV who start ART have substantially increased survival. 14 As a result, HIV prevalence is higher than it would be otherwise. Figure 1 illustrates the impact that scaling up ART from 0% coverage among those in need in 2005 to 100% coverage by 2015 would have on an advanced epidemic. Prevalence increases slightly because fewer people are dying from HIV-related causes. At the same time, incidence declines because a substantial fraction of those living with HIV are now on ART, which substantially reduces their infectivity, that is, their ability to infect their partners. In EPP 2009, based on a review by Baggaley and colleagues (unpublished), the default value for the infectivity of those on ART is set at 0.11 of the infectivity of persons not on ART, but the user can change this value on the User Preferences page. This figure was based on an extensive review of the relative HIV transmission probability of treated individuals compared to people not eligible for ART, estimated from the best field data available at the time as 0.20, an 80% reduction in infectivity. This figure was then adjusted for the average duration and relative infectiousness of the stages of HIV infection to provide the 0.11 figure for relative infectiousness compared to all infected individuals, that is, both those eligible for and ineligible for ART. This value is similar to those in another literature review and a recent cohort study, both of which found a 92% reduction in heterosexual transmission among those on ART relative to those not on therapy. 15 16 Adding ART to EPP 2009 required substantial changes to both the internal Reference Group model and the user interface: < The underlying equations describing the Reference Group model were modified to include the effects of ART on survival and new infections (see the appendix). < The EPP interface added an ART Data page for the user to provide information about the CD4 eligibility criterion, HIV progression rate and numbers on firstand second-line ART. < The Results page added a button, labelled 'ART results' which brings up a table displaying the number of people on ART and estimated percentage of ART need met.",

While previous versions of EPP and Spectrum used a single Weibull survival function for time from infection to death, EPP 2009 and current versions of Spectrum replaced this single function with four functions: a Weibull curve describing progression from infection to eligibility for ART, a second Weibull curve describing progression from eligibility to death in the absence of ART (see figure 3), and simple survival functions for those on firstand second-line ART expressed as the percentage of those on each treatment surviving from year to year. The eligibility Weibull function is used to progress people from the infected at-risk compartment into the currently eligible compartment based on their time since infection. EPP 2009 then uses current numbers of people on firstand second-line ART supplied by the user to divide eligible individuals into those untreated, those on first-line ART and those on second-line ART. For persons remaining in the untreated category, survival will follow the Weibull distribution of time from eligibility to death based on the time at which they became eligible. For those on first-line ART, survival is determined by two values: (1) the percentage surviving the first year on first-line ART, and 2 years on first-line ART. By default these are set to 86% and 90%, respectively, but may be changed by the user. If a person fails first-line therapy and slots are open for second-line therapy, they are moved to second-line therapy and 90% survival per year is assumed in subsequent years. If no slots are open, they progress to death. By tracking people's evolution through these additional compartments, the outputs of EPP 2009 incorporate the impacts of ART on prevalence and incidence.

Fast and slow progression patterns address the wide variability in survival observed between African and Thai cohorts. 17 This modified model requires several decisions and numerical inputs from the user in order to fully calculate ART effects: < CD4 eligibility threshold. The user must select eligibility for ART as a CD4 count below 200 cells/mm 3 or a CD4 below 350 cells/mm 3 . < Progression pattern. The user must select a progression pattern with an overall survival in the absence of ART of 11 years (normal pattern) or one with survival of 9 years (fast pattern). < Year-by-year estimates of percentage survival in the 1st year of ART. By default this is set to 86% surviving the first year and is kept at this value throughout the projection.

The problem could be alleviated by generating more parameter combinations, but this was very computationally demanding and time-consuming. EPP 2009 replaced the simple random sampling of possible combinations of variables in the Bayesian melding module with a procedure known as incremental mixture importance sampling (IMIS). 21 22 In IMIS, a smaller initial set of (r, f 0 , t 0 and 4) combinations is generated. (Note: If one is using the 4-shift described later in this paper, this group is expanded by two variables, 4 9 and the year in which the shift begins, t 4eshift .)",

The algorithm is unbiased for any choice of these parameters, but they do affect its efficiency. After extensive experimentation, good results were found with N 0 \u00bc4000, B\u00bc400 and J\u00bc3000. For 3000 resamples, finding 1900 unique curves ensures the resampled curves will be a good approximation to the actual distribution, so this was set as the default for national projections. For training purposes the number of unique curves was set at 400, which allows fits to be generated in a few minutes during workshops. Figure 6B illustrates how this procedure has generated a much higher number of unique curves, making the uncertainty bounds more accurate.",

No national HIV epidemic has ever been observed that actually declined to zero incidence. The problem here is that epidemics are dynamic, that is, the behaviours that drive them can and do change over time. However, the Reference Group model is static, that is, the four parameters that define the model (r, f 0 , t 0 and 4) are fixed and do not vary over timedthey must fit both the early epidemic and the late epidemic. While the 4 parameter was introduced to represent increased or decreased levels of risk behaviour over the course of the epidemic, 6 it forces a particular behaviour change pattern on a projection that is  itself static. In the real world, behaviours change, the proportion of people at risk changes, and any model with static parameters will not be able to capture the full complexity. In fact, in a few epidemics incidence is once again rising, something that the original Reference Group model was never intended to reproduce and which cannot be fitted with the standard four-parameter model.",

One alternative allowed for a one-time change in r, which represents the rate at which new infections occur among the susceptible population. However, this approach was found to be insufficient, as the change in r often occurred when there were no susceptibles left in the population to become infected. Other alternatives were also explored, including variants in which both r and 4 were allowed to change, and in which r shifted gradually over some time frame; but neither of these resolved the zero incidence issues. The solution finally adopted was to allow a slow shift in 4 over some period before the end of the projection period. The interpretation of this scenario is that as prevalence declines from its peak, some individuals who had reduced their risk behaviours in response to the epidemic, might return to riskier behaviours, which would increase recruitment into the susceptible population. By allowing such changes and applying constraints on incidence, more reasonable incidence patterns could be produced while still fitting the data. This produced a six-parameter model with (r, f 0 , t 0 and 4) supplemented by a 4 9 and a year, t 4eshift in which 4 began a slow shift to 4 9 by the end of the projection period. Using this approach, it was possible to fit the more problematic data sets without having incidence drop to zero (see figure 7).",

These patterns almost certainly result from behavioural changes, where lower levels of risk behaviour in the past are giving way to higher levels today, producing higher incidence. Such changes may result from prevention fatigue, perceptions of lower HIV severity with the availability of ART, new generations of susceptibles, or newly emerging epidemics in populations previously unaffected. Addressing these will require a more complex model than the simple four-parameter (r, f 0 , t 0 and 4) Reference Group model or even the new six-parameter 4-shift model outlined above. Work is currently underway to develop models that allow r to vary smoothly over time (described in Hogan et al 27 and in Bao and Raftery 28 ), thus permitting the combined SpectrumeEPP package to better handle the more complex behavioural trends being observed as the global pandemic enters its fourth decade.",

Since incidence was calculated as the percentage of susceptible individuals contracting HIV, the variations in their underlying population models resulted in slightly different calculations of the number of new infections between EPP and Spectrum. In some countries, migration, which is included in Spectrum's demographic model but not in EPP's, made a substantial difference in incidence levels. In addition, it became clear that better incidence estimates would be obtained if the Reference Group model was adapted to use a population between 15 and 49 years of age and allowed ageing out at 50, instead of the current 15+ population. These factors also contributed to differing ART estimates between the two models, sometimes requiring countries to go through an iterative process to reach an acceptable result. These problems are being addressed in the next round of EPP and Spectrum by combining them into a more tightly integrated package. EPP will take its demographics directly from Spectrum and will pass its incidence calculations to Spectrum without direct user intervention, thus ensuring better consistency. The user will actually invoke EPP from within Spectrum, thus providing a more holistic user experience.",

The Reference Group also recognises that many countries rely on case reporting systems as opposed to cross-sectional serosurveillance and has begun to explore methodologies for estimating the levels of under-reporting in such systems as diagnoses increase, but these discussions are still at an early stage. In the future, as techniques for such estimation improve, their incorporation into the UNAIDS estimation and projection suite may be considered.

John Stover developed the Weibull distributions used to progress individuals from infection to eligibility for ART and from eligibility to death and also supervises Spectrum development. Josh Salomon first recognised the limitations of the Reference Group model and suggested approaches involving steps and shifts in the model parameters to better fit some epidemics. Patrick Gerland first suggested the approach for combining urban and rural populations, and he and his colleagues at the United Nations Population Division provided the trends in urban/rural proportions incorporated into the software. Tim Brown coded these features into the EPP package. All seven serve as members of the UNAIDS Reference Group on HIV Estimates, Modelling and Projections which advises UNAIDS on the techniques to be used in EPP and Spectrum.
