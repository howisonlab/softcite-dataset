            "text": "Preserving the chemical and structural integrity of therapeutic antibodies during manufacturing and storage is a major challenge during pharmaceutical development. Oxidation of Fc methionines Met252 and Met428 is frequently observed, which leads to reduced affinity to FcRn and faster plasma clearance if present at high levels. Because oxidation occurs in both positions simultaneously, their individual contribution to the concomitant changes in pharmacokinetic properties has not been clearly established. A novel pH-gradient FcRn affinity chromatography method was applied to isolate three antibody oxidation variants from an oxidized IgG1 preparation based on their FcRn binding properties. Physico-chemical characterization revealed that the three oxidation variants differed predominantly in the number of oxMet252 per IgG (0, 1, or 2), but not significantly in the content of oxMet428. Corresponding to the increase in oxMet252 content, stepwise reduction of FcRn affinity in vitro, as well as faster clearance and shorter terminal half-life, in huFcRn-transgenic mice were observed. A single Met252 oxidation per antibody had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics (PK) compared with unmodified IgG. Importantly, only molecules with both heavy chains oxidized at Met252 exhibited significantly faster clearance. In contrast, Met428 oxidation had no apparent negative effect on PK and even led to somewhat improved FcRn binding and slower clearance. This minor effect, however, seemed to be abrogated by the dominant effect of Met252 oxidation. The novel approach of functional chromatographic separation of IgG oxidation variants followed by physico-chemical and biological characterization has yielded the first experimentally-backed explanation for the unaltered PK properties of antibody preparations containing relatively high Met252 and Met428 oxidation levels.",

            "text": "The more than 30 approved therapeutic antibodies in clinical use and \u00bb350 in clinical development demonstrate the importance of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutic entities in numerous disease indications, such as oncology, inflammation, transplantation, infection and ophthalmology. 1,2 Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the class and format most widely adopted for therapeutic antibodies. 3 The two variable antigen-binding fragments (Fab) of IgG mediate its specificity for the target antigen, while the crystallizable fragment (Fc) is responsible for its effector functions via interaction with the Fcg receptor (FcgR) family, and for its long serum half-life via interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). 4,5 Maintaining the chemical and structural integrity of antibody therapeutics during manufacturing and shelf-life is a major challenge during pharmaceutical development. 6 In particular, the effect of chemical modifications in the Fc of therapeutic IgGs on FcRn-mediated pharmacokinetic (PK) properties has become the subject of increasing interest for pharmaceutical companies and scrutiny by health authorities. One of the most widely observed and discussed chemical degradation events in IgGs is the oxidation of methionine (Met) to methionine sulfoxide in two positions in the Fc, and understanding its effect on FcRn interaction and PK is crucial to antibody therapeutics development. [7][8][9] In contrast to other chemical degradation pathways, the activation energy of methionine oxidation is rather low, which explains the focus on its role as one of the main potential causes of protein degradation during refrigerated storage. 10,11 When investigating the potential effect of chemical modifications on PK properties in vitro, analysis of the FcRn/IgG interaction is of vital importance. FcRn is a heterodimeric receptor consisting of two polypeptides, a 48-52 kDa class I major histocompatibility complex-like protein (a-FcRn) and a 14 kDa b2microglobulin (b2 min). The FcRn/IgG interaction occurs in a strictly pH-dependent manner in the endosomes of vascular endothelial cells and bone marrow-derived cells and functions to salvage IgG from lysosomal degradation. 5 FcRn binds to the CH2-CH3 portion of the Fc domain of IgG with high affinity at acidic endosomal pH. 12,13 The receptor then facilitates the recycling of IgGs to the cell surface and the subsequent release into the blood stream upon exposure of the FcRn/IgG complex to the neutral extracellular pH environment. 14 Crystal structure data and in vitro binding experiments indicate that the receptor-antibody interaction can occur in 2:1 stoichiometry, with two FcRn molecules binding to the two heavy chains (HC) of an IgG. 12,15 However, this hypothesis remains to be confirmed in vivo.",

            "text": "The FcRn binding region in the CH2-CH3 interface of the Fc contains two methionine residues located at positions 252 in the CH2 domain and 428 in the CH3 domain (Eu numbering 16 ), which are highly conserved among IgG isotypes. 17 Both residues are surface exposed, structurally close to the FcRn-binding interface and susceptible to oxidation, with the oxidation rate of Met252 being approximately twice that of Met428. 7,9 A third Met residue at position 358 has been described in some IgG1 alleles and is present in all other IgG subclasses. 17 Its buried location in the CH3 domain at the CH3/CH3 interface between the two antibody HCs and its significant distance to the FcRn binding site renders the oxidation of Met358, and an effect on FcRn binding, unlikely. Most probably due to its structural position, Met358 is found to oxidize at a much slower rate compared with Met252 and Met428 if present. 7,18 It has been described that Met252 and Met428 oxidation is accompanied by conformational changes in the backbone between residues 242-252 (Eu numbering 16 ) of the FcRn binding region. [19][20][21] Analysis of a truncated antibody Fc demonstrated that the main structural changes upon oxidation occur in the CH2 domain whereas the CH3 is less compromised. 22 Oxidation of Met252 and Met428 was shown to impair affinity to FcRn and PK properties of monoclonal antibodies. [7][8][9] However, only IgG preparations with high oxidation levels (\u00bb80% oxMet252) exhibited significantly faster clearance compared with nondegraded batches. 8 As a consequence, it has been hypothesized that only molecules with both HCs oxidized at least in one position have markedly altered FcRn affinity and faster clearance in vivo. 8,23 During processing and storage of antibody preparations, oxidation of Met252 and Met428 occurs in parallel at both positions, albeit with different reaction rates. 9,11,24 Even under tailored oxidation stress conditions, it has not been possible to generate antibody samples selectively oxidized at one position only. [7][8][9]22,25 With the two methionines present in each HC, four oxidation sites exist in the IgG Fc, giving rise to a total of 10 Fc oxidation variants containing 0 to 4 Met oxidations per molecule ( Fig. 1). 8 This heterogeneity is the main reason for the current lack of understanding of the contribution of Met252 vs. Met428 oxidation to structural changes, FcRn binding affinity and in vivo clearance. Improved understanding of the FcRn affinities and PK properties of these 10 Fc methionine oxidation variants would be of considerable value for the development of antibody therapeutics. The prerequisite for this, however, is the ability to resolve and separate the oxidation variants in a preparative manner for in vitro and in vivo characterization. So far, attempts using common chromatographic purification techniques have not delivered samples enriched in certain IgG oxidation variants, but rather provided mixtures of antibody species oxidized at both positions, Met252 and Met428. 8,9 Furthermore, site-specific mutations of these two residues can have varying effect on FcRn binding, depending on the nature and size of the introduced amino acid. Mutation of Met252 can significantly increase or decrease the affinity to FcRn, whereas changing Met428 to another amino acid led to stronger affinity to the receptor and prolonged serum half-life in vivo. 26 Thus, mutant IgG models to study the consequences of Fc methionine oxidation need to be considered carefully. In the study presented here, we applied a novel pH-gradient FcRn affinity chromatography method that closely mimics the physiological conditions of interaction between FcRn and IgG to isolate three functionally distinct antibody oxidation variants from a hydrogen peroxide-treated IgG1 batch based on their different FcRn-binding properties. 27 The structure-function relationship of Fc methionine oxidation could be established, and the individual contribution of oxMet252 vs. oxMet428 to FcRn affinity loss and PK impairments could be clarified.",

After hydrogen peroxide treatment, the chromatogram of the antibody, now termed mAb1_Ox, exhibited three distinct peaks, whereby the retention time of the last eluting peak corresponds to the main peak in the untreated mAb1 sample (Fig. 2, gray curves). Two additional peaks, named prepeaks I and II, eluted earlier and at lower pH in the gradient than the main peak. Thus, the FcRn column resolved a total of 3 distinct antibody oxidation variants in the hydrogen peroxide-treated sample mAb1_Ox that differed in their affinity to FcRn, with the latest eluting variant (main peak) exhibiting the highest and the earliest eluting variant (prepeak II) the lowest FcRn binding properties.",

This oxidized material mAb1_Ox, exhibiting 3 peaks, was applied to the preparative FcRn affinity column and 10 mg of each peak were isolated for further in vitro and in vivo characterization ( Fig. 3C). Because the three peaks were not base-line resolved, the peak valleys were not included in the fraction pools in order to obtain the individual variants as pure as possible (Fig. 3C). The 3 fraction pools, original mAb1 and mAb1_Ox were dialyzed in formulation buffer containing 5 mM L-methionine to suppress further oxidation. The protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml in all samples and aliquots were stored frozen below -60 C to avoid any further degradation and modification.",

Surprisingly, a very strong and stepwise increase of oxMet252 from 3 to 50 to 90% was detected in mAb1_Ox_main peak, mAb1_Ox_prepeak I and mAb1_Ox_prepeak II, respectively. These increasing oxMet252 levels clearly correlate with the stepwise decrease in retention time and affinity on the FcRn column ( Fig. 4; Table 1). In contrast, oxidation levels at position Met428 showed no strict correlation with retention time and affinity on the column. They differed insignificantly between mAb1_Ox_main peak (20% oxMet428) and mAb1_Ox_prepeak I (23% oxMet428) and were only increased to 42% in mAb1_Ox_prepeak II.

Here, the observed steep and stepwise FcRn affinity reduction of the three isolated species from mAb1_Ox is accompanied by the equally stepwise increase in oxMet252 content ( Fig. 4; Table 1).

The plasmin digest indicates that the 20% oxMet428 found in this fraction are most probably distributed statistically. Apart from the dominant 0 oxMet signal, a significant 1 oxMet and a smaller 2 oxMet signal can be detected in the mass spectrum ( Fig. 5). In analogy, mAb1_Ox_prepeak II contains predominantly antibody variants that carry oxMet252 in both HCs (90% oxMet252 in total). This is confirmed by the detection of a minimum of 2 oxMet in the corresponding mass spectrum of the plasmin digested sample. The 42% of Met428 in this sample are most probably also distributed statistically due to the presence of a significant 3 oxMet signal and a less prominent 4 oxMet signal in the mass spectrum of the Fc. The intermediate fraction, mAb1_Ox_prepeak I Fc (50% oxMet252) exhibits a minimum of one oxidation (1 oxMet) in addition to a significant quantity of 2 oxMet and lower levels of 3 oxMet. The complete absence of 0 and 4 oxMet in this fraction, which would have been present if both, oxMet252 and oxMet428, were distributed statistically, demonstrate that all antibody variants in mAb1_Ox_prepeak I carry at least one oxMet252. Hence, the hypothesis that the affinity of mAb1 oxidation variants to FcRn in the pH-gradient of the FcRn chromatography predominantly depends on the total number of Met252 oxidations per antibody molecule-0, 1, or 2 oxMet252-but not on the oxidation status at position Met428, has been verified by the accumulated analytical data.

MAb1_Ox exhibited a significant decrease of 21% in total binding levels compared with mAb1. After fractionation, mAb1_Ox_main peak showed the highest overall binding and slowest off-rate of all five samples with the 6% improvement in total binding compared with mAb1 being significant. The binding properties of this variant are noteworthy considering the 20% oxMet428 (and 3% oxMet252) content of mAb1_Ox_main peak compared with baseline oxidation levels in mAb1 ( Table 1). These data suggest that oxMet428 does not impair the FcRn/IgG interactions and may even hint toward a positive effect on FcRn affinity. In comparison to mAb1 and mAb1_Ox_main peak, mAb1_Ox_prepeaks I and II show a significant and stepwise loss of binding levels and increased off-rates. The RU max. values of mAb1_Ox_pre peak I and mAb1_Ox_prepeak II are reduced by 33% and 67%, respectively, compared with mAb1.

To explore the effect of Met252 and Met428 oxidation on antibody clearance and terminal half-life, a PK study was performed in a human FcRn-transgenic mouse model. HuFcRn-transgenic mice were chosen to provide for the well-known species-specificity of the FcRn/IgG interaction. 29 Importantly, mAb1 does not bind to the murine target. HuFcRn transgenic mice were injected intravenously with a single dose of the five samples at a dose level of 10 mg/kg. The corresponding serum concentrations were analyzed over a time period of 28 d. Serum concentrations vs. time profiles of all samples exhibited a biphasic profile with an initial rapid decrease in antibody serum concentration within the first 24 h followed by a log-linear decline over time as shown in Figure 8A.

The rate of oxidation of Met252 is approximately twice that of Met428, leading to a higher oxMet252 than oxMet428 content after forced oxidation or real-time storage. [7][8][9]22,25 The use of point mutations to mimic or block oxidation either at Met252 or Met428 leads to considerable changes in the affinity to FcRn, likely due to structural distortions in the Fc. 26,33 Exchange of Met252 and Met428 has been shown to compromise or increase FcRn interactions. 26,34 Such mutational approaches are of value, but cannot simulate the situation of methionine oxidation exactly. They need to be designed with great care in order to enable conclusions relevant for the wild-type situation. Due to these reasons, a highly resolved structure-function relationship of the individual effect of oxMet252 and oxMet428 has not been established yet.",

Adjustment of the pH gradient allows optimal separation and characterization of antibody variants detected in a sample of interest. In comparison to common chromatographic methods (e.g., size exclusion or ion-exchange chromatography) that utilize artificial matrices and binding groups for separation, FcRn chromatography resolves molecule species based on their affinity to an immobilized physiological interaction partner. 21,30,31 Similar to these methods, FcRn chromatography can be scaled up to facilitate preparative isolation of variants. This enables secondary characterization strategies for the separated variants, such as physico-chemical analysis and PK assessment, and facilitates the establishment of structure-function relationships.",

Wang et al. 21 have previously indicated that oxidation of Met252 (CH2 domain) and Met428 (CH3 domain) is accompanied by subtle conformational changes in the FcRn binding region. Studies using a truncated antibody Fc demonstrated that the main structural changes upon oxidation occur in the CH2 domain, whereas the CH3 is less compromised. 22 The melting temperature (T m ) of the CH2 domain is markedly decreased upon oxidation while the T m of the CH3 only changes slightly. In support of these findings, the rates of deamidation of two CH2 asparagine residues were significantly increased upon oxidation, while those of other residues were not affected. These results are in excellent agreement with our melting temperature data of an oxidized full-length IgG1 (data not shown). The regions undergoing significant structural changes by oxidation of Met252 and Met428 were mapped to CH2 residues 243-247 using hydrogen/deuterium exchange LC-MS peptide mapping. 20 In the same report, a detailed molecular mechanism for the affinity reduction between FcRn and IgG induced by Met252 oxidation has been suggested. Impaired hydrophobic interactions between oxMet252 and Pro134 of FcRn and repulsion between oxMet252 and Glu135 seem to be responsible for the decrease in affinity. While Met252 oxidation directly affected FcRn/ IgG binding, Met428 oxidation is hypothesized to destabilize the CH2-CH3 hinge region, probably by disrupting the hydrophobic core formed between CH2 and CH3. 20 However, our results and the data reported by Hinton et al. 26 on Met428 oxidation and site-specific mutants, respectively, may suggest that molecular changes at this position may also lead to improved FcRn binding.",

According to these findings, a 1:1 stoichiometry for the FcRn/IgG1 interaction is sufficient in vivo. However, the \u00bb20% difference in the Met428 oxidation content between these two samples also has to be considered. Interestingly, antibody species with only increased Met428 oxidation levels (mAb1_Ox_main peak: 20% oxMet428), but baseline oxMet252 content (3%), exhibited increased affinity to FcRn in SPR analysis and significantly slower plasma clearance compared with mAb1 control. These surprising results, which may suggest a positive effect of Met428 oxidation on FcRn binding and PK, are in agreement with previous studies in which Met428Leu mutants were evaluated in rhesus monkeys. 26 This mutant showed an 11-fold increase in binding to human FcRn at pH 6.0 compared with the wild-type counterpart in a competitive FcRn binding assay. PK analysis in rhesus monkeys demonstrated an \u00bb2.3-fold lower mean clearance for a T250Q/M428L double mutant compared with wild-type IgG. 26 While the dominant negative impact of Met252 oxidation on FcRn/IgG interactions and in vivo clearance is apparent from our results, the potential positive effect of Met428 oxidation is less evident, but should at least be considered for data interpretation.",

However, coinciding observations have been reported previously by Wang et al. 8 and may be explained by interpretation of our data. MAb1_Ox is comprised of a mixture of three main mAb1 oxidation variants with each showing a distinctive PK profile in our study. The integration of the relative peak areas in the analytical FcRn chromatogram of mAb1_Ox yielded: 30% mAb1_Ox main peak with the slowest clearance of all five samples (even slower than mAb1), 20% mAb1_Ox_prepeak II with the fastest clearance (approx. twice the rate of mAb1), and 50% mAb1_Ox_prepeak I with a clearance that is slightly, but not significantly, faster than that of mAb1 ( Figs. 6 and 8B). This composition may help to explain the relatively indistinguishable PK profile of mAb1_Ox compared with mAb1. The fast clearance of 20% of the antibodies (mAb1_Ox_prepeak II) in the mixture seems to be partially compensated by 30% of molecules that exhibit a small, but significantly slower clearance (mAb1_Ox_main peak). From the relative quantities of the three variants in mAb1_Ox, obtained from the integrated peak areas, and from the clearance values of the three isolated variants, a theoretical clearance for mAb1_Ox can be calculated that corresponds accurately to the plasma clearance experimentally determined in the PK study (data not shown). Thus, the experimental data indeed support the hypothesis that oxidation at Met428 alone may lead to somewhat improved FcRn binding.",

On the contrary, the clearance of this sample is markedly faster than expected from the clearance slope between mAb1_Ox_main peak and prepeak I. It appears that Met428 oxidation can amplify the reduction in FcRn affinity and increase in clearance if it occurs in parallel to Met252 oxidation. Possibly, Met428 oxidation has an additional negative effect on FcRn binding only if co-located on the same HC with oxMet252. In this case, the higher oxMet428 levels in mAb1_Ox_prepeak II compared with the other two peaks may be the result of the fractionation procedure. In this sample, the early eluting flank of the peak was included, while it was omitted during fractionation of the two other peaks (Fig. 3C). For example, for mAb1_Ox_main peak, only the late eluting 2/3 of the peak were collected. In case there would be a gradient of oxidation sub-species within the three peaks, the variants containing both oxMet252 and oxMet428 on the same HCs would most probably exhibit the lowest affinity to the FcRn column, and thus elute in the front flank of the respective peaks. This hypothesis can be supported by the asymmetrical shape of mAb1_Ox_prepeak II that exhibits a small shoulder at lower retention times (Fig. 3C). Further studies of the distribution of oxMet428 and oxMet252 within the individual three peaks are required to investigate this.",

Using FcRn affinity chromatography, we could now determine the distribution of the three main Met252 oxidation variants in mAb1_Ox (Met252/ Met252, oxMet252/Met252, and oxMet252/oxMet252) experimentally.

Due to the homodimeric structure of IgG, the oxidation hotspots are present in duplicate. Relative values from the theoretical simulation are compared with experimentally derived values.

For example, for variant mAb1_Ox_main peak_oxMet428/Met428 (in bold): 2 (HC isomers, one oxMet428 on left or on right HC) x 0.2 (oxMet428 content in mAb1_Ox_main peak) x 0.8 (Met428 content in mAb1_Ox_main peak) x 0.3 (rel. peak area of mAb1_Ox_main peak in FcRn chromatogram) x 100 D \u00bb10%. these three peaks, the Met428/oxMet428 distribution can be easily calculated from the peptide map data assuming a binomial distribution (Scheme 1). Indeed, when comparing the relative quantities of the 10 oxidation variants of mAb1_Ox derived from our experimental data set with the simulation performed according to Ionescu et al., 23 a good agreement of the results is observed. The reaction rates for the oxidation used for this simulation were 0.19 h \u00a11 and 0.09 h \u00a11 for Met252 and Met428 oxidation, respectively. 9 Notable discrepancies between the experimental and simulated values were observed mainly for the three highly oxidized species containing three or four oxidized methionines. Discrepancies may be due to the negligence of structural changes induced by oxidation at one position that lead to altered reaction rates for the remaining three methionines in the simulation model.",

            "text": "Three main antibody oxidation variants were isolated from a hydrogen peroxide-treated IgG batch based on their different FcRn binding properties utilizing the novel pH gradient FcRn affinity chromatography as a preparative tool. By this approach we were able to isolate and characterize antibody oxidation variants differing in the content of oxMet252 and, to a lesser extent, oxMet428 for the first time. FcRn/IgG interaction characteristics in the FcRn chromatography were confirmed by SPR analysis and have been shown to be predictive of FcRn-mediated PK properties in vivo. Met252 oxidation was the dominant contributor to PK impairment observed in mice transgenic for the human FcRn receptor. Importantly, increased plasma clearance was only observed if both IgG HCs were oxidized at Met252. The effect of Met428 oxidation on FcRn binding is most probably subordinate to the dominant chemical/structural changes due to Met252 oxidation, but may amplify this negative effect if co-localized.",
