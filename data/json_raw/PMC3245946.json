            "text": "b-D-3 0-Azido-2 0 ,3 0-dideoxyguanosine (3 0-azido-ddG) is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication with a superior resistance profile to zidovudine. Recently, we identified five novel 6-modified-3 0-azido-ddG analogs that exhibit similar or superior anti-HIV-1 activity compared to 3 0-azido-ddG in primary cells. To gain insight into their structure-activity-resistance relationships, we synthesized their triphosphate (TP) forms and assessed their ability to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Steadystate and pre-steady-state kinetic experiments show that the 6-modified-3 0-azido-ddGTP analogs act as adenosine rather than guanosine mimetics in DNA synthesis reactions. The order of potency of the TP analogs against wild-type RT was: 3 0-azido-2,6-diaminopurine >3 0-azido-6-chloropurine; 3 0-azido-6-N-allylaminopurine > 2-amino-6-N,Ndimethylaminopurine; 2-amino-6-methoxypurine. Molecular modeling studies reveal unique hydrogen-bonding interactions between the nucleotide analogs and the template thymine base in the active site of RT. Surprisingly, the structure-activity relationship of the analogs differed in HIV-1 RT ATP-mediated excision assays of their monophosphate forms, suggesting that it may be possible to rationally design a modified base analog that is efficiently incorporated by RT but serves as a poor substrate for ATP-mediated excision reactions. Overall, these studies identify a promising strategy to design novel nucleoside analogs that exert profound antiviral activity against both WT and drugresistant HIV-1.",

            "text": "Most combination therapies used to treat antiretroviral-na\u0131\u00a8ve and -experienced HIV-1 infected patients include at least two nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTIs). NRTIs are analogs of 2 0 -deoxyribonucleosides that lack a 3 0 -OH group on the ribose sugar/pseudosugar. Once metabolized by host cell kinases to their active triphosphate (TP) forms, they inhibit viral reverse transcription by acting as chain terminators of HIV-1 RT DNA synthesis (1). Although combination therapies that contain two or more NRTIs have substantially reduced mortality from HIV-1 associated disease, the approved NRTIs have significant limitations that include acute and chronic toxicity, and the selection of drug-resistant variants of HIV-1 that exhibit cross-resistance to other NRTIs. Accordingly, there is a need to develop potent and safe NRTIs that demonstrate activity against a broad-range of drugresistant HIV-1.",

To specifically identify NRTIs that retain activity against a broad spectrum of drug-resistant HIV-1, our group adopted a rational discovery approach that utilized structure-activity-resistance relationships to identify NRTI base and sugar moieties that retain potent activity against drug-resistant HIV-1 (2,3). Importantly, this approach identified 3 0 -azido-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxyguanosine (3 0 -azido-ddG) as a lead compound (4) that exhibits potent activity against HIV-1 variants that contain the discrimination mutations K65R, L74V or M184V and against HIV-1 that contains multiple thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) that enhance nucleotide excision. Furthermore, 3 0 -azido-ddG does not exhibit cytotoxicity in primary lymphocytes or epithelial and T-cell lines, and does not decrease the mitochondrial DNA content of HepG2 cells (4).",

The RNA and DNA templates were prepared as described previously (3). Both the RNAand DNA-dependent DNA synthesis reactions were primed with the same 5 0 -end-32 P-labeled 18-nt DNA 6-methoxypurine (3 0 -azido-6-MX-P) and 3 0 -azido-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxy-2-amino-6-N-allylaminopurine (3 0 -azido-6-AA-P). The EC 50 values, adapted from Zhang et al. (5), are for WT HIV-1 and were determined in peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells. primer (5 0 -GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCA-3 0 ) that corresponds to the HIV-1 primer binding site. DNA synthesis reactions (20 ml) were carried out in a 50-mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer that contained 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 20 nM T/P, 0.5 mM of each dNTP and varying concentrations of the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analogs. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 200 nM WT HIV-1 RT, incubated at 37 C for 30 min (DNA-dependent DNA synthesis) or 60 min (RNA-dependent DNA synthesis) and then quenched by addition of 20 ml of gel loading buffer (98% deionized formamide containing 1 mg/ml each of bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol). Samples were then denatured at 95 C for 10 min and polymerization products were separated from substrates by denaturing gel electrophoresis using 14% acrylamide gels containing 7 M urea. DNA synthesis was analyzed by phosphorimaging using a GS-525 Molecular Imager and Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). (ii) Inhibition of HIV-1 RT DNA synthesis was also evaluated to determine IC 50 values using a 5 0 -end-32 P-labeled 19-nt DNA primer (5 0 -TTGTAG CACCATCCAAAGG-3 0 ) that was annealed to one of three 36-nt DNA templates that contained five consecutive thymine, cytosine or adenosine bases. In this regard, inhibition of HIV-1 RT DNA synthesis by analogs with adenine, guanine or thymine bases were evaluated using the templates (T1, 5 0 -CA GACTTTTTCAGACCTTTGGATGGTGCTACA AGCT-3 0 ), (T2, 5 0 -CAGAGCCCCCGAGACCTTT GGATGGTGCTACAAGCT-3 0 ), or (T3, 5 0 -CTGC TAAAAACTGCCCTTTGGATGGTGCTACAAG CT-3 0 ), respectively. The T1 template was used for inhibition of WT and mutant HIV-1 RT DNA synthesis by each of the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analogs. Reaction conditions and gel electrophoresis were identical to those described above except 100 nM of WT or mutant HIV-1 RT was used to initiate the reaction. Reactions were quenched following incubation at 37 C for 10 min. The amount of final product on the denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels was quantified by densiometric analysis using Quantity One Software. The concentration of each 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analog required to inhibit the formation of final product by 50% was calculated using nonlinear regression analyses (SigmaPlot Software Version 11, Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) from at least three independent experiments.

The 3 0 -OH of the primer strand as well as the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-2 0 ,3-ddGTP analogs and complementary bases in the template strand were built into the model to generate a pre-initiation complex, as described previously (11). Tautomerization and protonation potential of the entire system was calculated using the Generalized Born/Volume Integral (GB/VI) electrostatics method of Labute (12). Energy gradient minimization was carried out using MMFF94x force field in the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE 2008.02; Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Ligand interactions were quantified and images generated using the LigX interaction function in MOE. Structural models comparing incorporation and excision of specific nucleotide analogs used the PDB co-ordinates 3KLF and 3KLE that contain the excision product AZT adenosine dinucleoside tetraphosphate (AZTppppA) (13). To eliminate the potential force field bias from alignment of bases, empirically derived angle relations were used for all analogs tested. 3KLF and 3KLE were fit to the p66 subunit of 1RTD using the Matchmaker function in Chimera version 1.51 (UCSF Chimera, Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco). Aligned structures were opened in MOE and dihedral angles were measured from bases relative to the ribose ring O and C1 of both template and bound nucleotides for each complex. MOE's builder function was used to modify each template/bound nucleotide base pair retaining the experimental dihedrals. Hydrogen-bonding potential between the aligned base pairs was quantified using the 'FindHBond' function in Chimera with default settings. Parts of modeling workflow was automated using Pipeline Pilot 7.5 (Accelrys Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA)",

The sequences of the RNA and DNA templates correspond to the HIV-1 sequence used for (\u00c0) strong stop DNA synthesis, and both reactions were primed with the same 18-nt DNA primer that was complementary to the HIV-1 primer binding site (3). 3 0 -Azido-ddGTP, 3 0 -azido-ddATP, 3 0 -azido-ddCTP and ZDV-TP were included as controls in these experiments. Unexpectedly, we found that HIV-1 RT recognized all of the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP nucleotides as adenosine analogs and incorporated them opposite thymine in DNA (Figure 2A) or uracil in RNA ( Figure 2B). As anticipated, their incorporation resulted in chain-termination of DNA synthesis. Under the assay conditions described in Figure 2, the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP nucleotides were not incorporated into the nascent DNA opposite cytosine. However, if the dNTP concentration was lowered to 0.1 mM, chain termination opposite cytosine was observed (data not shown). We also determined the concentration of 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analog required to inhibit DNA synthesis (i.e. IC 50 ) using a different heteropolymeric DNA/DNA T/P substrate, as described in the 'Materials and Methods' section ( Table 2).

Because the 6-modified-3 0azido-ddGTP analogs behave as adenine nucleotide analogs, we included 3 0 -azido-ddATP as a control. The results (Table 1) show that the catalytic efficiency of incorporation (k pol /K d ) of 3 0 -azido-2,6-DA-P-TP was similar to that of dATP and 3 0 -azido-ddATP. Consistent with the steady-state kinetic experiments, 3 0 -azido-6-Cl-P-TP, 3 0 -azido-6-AA-P-TP and 3 0 -azido-6-MX-P-TP were all less efficiently incorporated by WT HIV-1 compared to dATP. The observed decreases in catalytic efficiency for each of these substrates was driven by both a decrease in the rate of nucleotide incorporation (i.e. k pol ) and a decrease in the affinity of the nucleotide for the polymerase active site (i.e. K d ). Due to limited quantities of the 3 0 -azido-6-DM-P-TP, we were unable to obtain pre-steady-state kinetic data for this analog. We also assessed the ability of the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analogs to be incorporated opposite cytosine ( Table 1). The data show that, in comparison to dGTP, the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analogs were inefficiently incorporated by HIV-1 RT. The only compound with reasonable activity as a G-analog was 3 0 -azido-6-Cl-P-TP; however, its selectivity value versus dGTP (254) was $7-fold less than its selectivity value versus dATP (35).",

These substitutions are typically referred to as NRTI discrimination mutations. To determine whether NRTI discrimination mutations impacted RTs' ability to recognize and incorporate the 6-modified-ddGTP analogs, we determined the concentration of nucleotide analog required to inhibit 50% of the DNA polymerase activity (i.e. IC 50 ) under steady-state assay conditions using the heteropolymeric DNA/DNA T/P substrates as described in the 'Materials and Methods' section ( Table 2). 3 0 -Azido-ddATP, 3 0 -azido-ddGTP and ZDV-TP were again included as controls.

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated that 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP nucleotides act as adenosine mimetics for DNA synthesis carried out by HIV-1 RT. Of the five analogs studied, 3 0 -azido-2,6-DA-P-TP, which has a 2,6-diaminopurine base, was found to be the most efficient substrate for incorporation by HIV-1 RT. In pre-steady-state kinetic experiments, 3 0 -azido-2,6-DA-P-TP was recognized and incorporated by WT HIV-1 RT as efficiently as dATP and 3 0 -azido-ddATP. The analogs that contain the 2-amino-6-N,N-dimethylaminopurine (3 0 -azido-6-DM-P-TP) or 2-amino-6-methoxypurine (3 0 -azido-6-MX-P-TP) bases, however, were poor substrates for incorporation by HIV-1 RT. Our molecular modeling studies suggest that 6-modifications with a branched side-chain (e.g. 3 0 -azido-6-DM-P-TP) or one with electronic incompatibility (e.g. 3 0 -azido-6-MX-P-TP) may alter the alignment of the bases and move their a-phosphate away from the primer 3 0 -OH, thus impairing nucleotide incorporation. In contrast, 3 0 -azido-2,6-DA-P-TP, 3 0 -azido-6-CL-P-TP and 3 0 -azido-6-AA-P-TP form relatively planar basepairing interactions with the template thymine that enhance their a-phosphate interaction with the 3 0 -OH of the primer. Compared to the canonical A:T base pair, the additional hydrogen bond achieved by the 3 0 -azido-2,6-DA-P:thymine base pair may further stabilize the a-phosphate, facilitating the favorable catalytic efficiency observed in pre-steady-state assays. In contrast, the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP nucleotide analogs are inefficiently incorporated by HIV-1 RT opposite cytosine bases. Taken together, these findings are consistent with those of Cheong et al. who reported that oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes containing 2,6-diaminopurine formed more stable base pairs opposite thymine than cytosine (16). The mutations K65R, L74V, Q151M (in complex with A62V, V75I, F77L and F116Y) or M184V in HIV-1 RT allow the enzyme to discriminate between the natural dNTP substrate and modified nucleotide analogs. In Table 2, we show that the K65R, L74V and Q151M mutations confer low levels of resistance to both 3 0 -azido-ddATP and 3 0 -azido-ddGTP at the enzyme level. Modification at the 6-position of the purine base does not appear to enhance this discrimination phenotype: the K65R, L74V or A62V/V75I/F77L/F116Y/Q151M HIV-1 RTs all exhibited fold-resistance changes to each of the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analogs that were largely similar (i.e. <2-fold) to the fold change in resistance values determined for 3 0 -azido-ddATP. Interestingly, the structure-activity relationship for the ATP-mediated excision of the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGMP analogs by WT or TAM-containing HIV-1 RT differed from the structure-activity relationship for their incorporation.",

            "text": "For example, whereas 3 0 -azido-6-CL-P-TP is a relatively good substrate for incorporation, it is not efficiently excised by either WT or TAM-containing HIV-1 RT. In this regard, our modeling data show that the hydrogenbonding patterns observed for this analog differs from that of 3 0 -azido-2,6-DA-P and 3 0 -azido-6-AA-P ( Figure 5). As such, it is possible that the change in transition state geometry required for excision is not sufficiently stabilized by the 6-Cl substituted guanine analog base-paired with thymine. Taken together, these data suggest that the optimal conformation of the HIV-1 RT active site differs for incorporation and excision and further suggests that 6-position modifications differentially effect these two reactions. This finding provides 'proof of concept' that modified base analogs can be identified that are efficiently incorporated by HIV-1 RT but serve as a poor substrate for HIV-1 ATP-mediated excision reactions. Further optimization of these Figure 5.

Intracellular pharmacology analyses, however, revealed that each of these compounds was efficiently metabolized by adenosine deaminase to 3 0 -azido-ddG in cells (5). Therefore, the observed anti-HIV-1 activity of each of these nucleoside analogs was not primarily due to incorporation of the ambiguous purine nucleotides described in this study. However, we recently identified RS-788, a 5 0 -monophosphate prodrug of 3 0 -azido-2,6-DA-P, as a potent and selective inhibitor of HIV-1 replication (Schinazi et al., 16th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (2009) Abstract 557). In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, RS-788 is metabolized $1:1 to both 3 0 -azido-2,6-DA-P-TP and 3 0 -azido-ddGTP. Consequently, RS-788 delivers two chemically distinct metabolites each of which are potent HIV-1 RT chain terminators that are incorporated opposite different complementary bases (cytosine for 3 0 -azido-ddGTP and thymine for 3 0 -azido-2,6-DA-P-TP). Therefore, our studies provide a promising new approach for the design and development of novel ambiguous NRTI that exert profound antiviral activity against WT and drug-resistant HIV-1.",
