The complete structural elucidation of GPI anchors is a complex process that requires relatively large amounts of starting material. In this paper, we assess the degree of structural information that can be obtained by applying electrospray mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry to permethylated GPI glycans prepared from a well-characterized GPIanchored glycoprotein, the variant surface glycoprotein from Trypanosoma brucei. All GPI glycans contain a non-N-acetylated glucosamine residue, and permethylation leads to the formation of a fixed positive charge on the glycans, in the form of a quaternary amine. The permethylated glycans were detected as [M + Na] 2+ ions, and tandem mass spectrometry of these ions produced substantial, albeit incomplete, structural information on the branching patterns and linkage types for various GPI glycoforms of the variant surface glycoprotein.",

            "text": "Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are ubiquitous among the eukaryotes and are of considerable biological interest, with functions in cell protection, cell signaling, cell-cell adhesion and host cell-pathogen interactions (Ferguson et al. 2008;Paulick and Bertozzi 2008). GPI anchors are preassembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and added to the C-termini of certain proteins in the ER in exchange for the C-terminal signal peptide via a transamidation reaction (Ferguson et al. 2008;Fujita and Kinoshita 2010). The GPI anchor may then be further processed via lipid remodeling and carbohydrate side-chain modifications, in a protein and cell type specific manner, as the GPI-AP transits the secretory pathway (Ferguson et al. 2008;Fujita and Kinoshita 2010). The final destination for most GPI-APs is the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or the topologically equivalent luminal surface of secretory granule membranes.",

            "text": "To elucidate the complete structure of a GPI anchor is a lengthy undertaking that requires relatively large amounts of native protein and techniques including 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based composition and methylation linkage analyses, for example (Fankhauser et al. 1993;Ferguson et al. 1988;Homans et al. 1988;Schneider et al. 1990). However, with one exception (from the highly divergent protist Entamoeba; Moody-Haupt et al. 2000), all GPI anchors determined thus far share the common core structure of: NH 2 CH 2 CH 2 PO 4 H-6Man\u03b11-2Man\u03b11-6Man\u03b11-4GlcN\u03b11-6D-myo-inositol-1-HPO 4 -lipid (EtN-P-Man 3 GlcN-PI), where the amine of the ethanolamine phosphate (EtN-P) group is the attachment point to the \u03b1-carboxyl group of the C-terminus of the protein (Ferguson et al. 2008). In this paper, we exploit the chemistry of GPI anchors by using (a) aqueous hydrogen fluoride (HF) dephosphorylation to liberate the GPI anchor glycan from the parent GPI-AP and (b) permethylation to convert the free amine of the single non-N-acetylated glucosamine residue to a quaternary amine carrying a fixed positive charge. The permethylated GPI glycans ionize well in positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS), thanks in part to this quaternary amine feature (Baldwyn 2005). We assess the scope and limitations of structural interpretation that can be obtained from collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass spectrometry (ES-MS/MS) of permethylated GPI glycans, using a series of well-characterized structures derived from a variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) from the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei.",

            "text": "In order to test the usefulness of electrospray tandem mass spectrometry for comprehensive GPI glycan characterization, the carbohydrate component of the sVSG121 GPI anchor was released from the GPI protein by aqueous HF treatment, permethylated and purified by solvent extraction (see Figure 1). The permethylated glycans were redissolved in 80% acetonitrile and 0.5 mM sodium acetate and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, revealing three major isobaric forms of GPI glycan. The permethylated glycans contained a fixed positive charge due to the quaternary amine formed during methylation of the glucosamine residue and ionized as sodium adducts, producing doubly charged [M + Na] 2+ ions at m/z 871.9, 973.9 and 1075.9 (see Figure 2). These m/z values were consistent with fully permethylated glycan ions of composition [Hex 6 -HexN (Me 3 ) + Ino + Na] 2+ , [Hex 7 -HexN(Me 3 ) + Ino + Na] 2+ and [Hex 8 -HexN(Me 3 ) + Ino + Na] 2+ . Based on the known structure of the sVSG121 GPI anchor (Strang et al. 1993) and of the closely related sVSG117 and sVSG221 anchors Mehlert et al. 1997), these ions can be further assigned to the compositions [Gal Mass spectrometry of GPI anchors a rough estimate of the relative amounts of the different species in the sample. Thus, according to the spectrum, the Gal 3 -and Gal 4 -glycoforms of sVSG121 were much more abundant than the Gal 5 -glycoform, in agreement with the relative abundances observed by gel filtration of fluorescently labeled GPI glycans from the same glycoprotein (Zitzmann et al. 2000). The doubly charged permethylated GPI glycoforms were selected for CID to provide structural information, in particular to define sequence, branching and linkage details. The precursor [M + Na] 2+ ions produced singly charged product ions arising predominantly from cleavage across the glycosidic bonds together with a number of additional product ions derived from cross-ring cleavages, as will be discussed later. The nomenclature used to define fragmentation is based on that introduced by Domon and Costello (1988). In this instance, an \u03b1 suffix is used to designate cleavages in the GPI anchor mannosyl core and a \u03b2 suffix for cleavages in the 3-linked alphagalactose branch attached to the GPI core. Fragments derived from cross-ring cleavages are A-type ions, where the superscript defines the position of the cleavage after the corresponding carbon atom of the sugar ring.",

Cross-ring cleavage ions at m/z 505.2, 533.2, 723.3 and 1349.5 could be identified, though they were relatively weak (see Figure 4, indicated with black arrows). The m/z 533.2 and m/z 505.2 ions, which were 88 and 60 amu above the glycosidic fragment ion at m/z 445.2, [Me (Hex) 2 + Na] + , indicated the Hex 2 moiety to be 6-linked (see Figure 5a). Thus, this ion is consistent with a 1\u21926 linkage in the trimannosyl GPI core (i.e., Man-Man1-6Man) and in the linear trigalactosyl side chain (i.e., Gal-Gal1-6Gal). The cross-ring fragment ion observed at m/z 1349.5 defined the trimannosyl core to be linked to the 4-position of the glucosamine, as it resided 88 amu above the B-type ion at m/z 1261.5, and a 60-amu increment could not be detected (see Figures 4 and 5b). This arrangement was further supported by an ambiguous A-type ion at m/z 723.3, which was 74 amu above the ion at m/z 635.3, [Me(Hex) 3 -14 + Na] + (see Figure 5c). Together, these results were consistent with the presence of the conserved sequence Man\u03b11-2Man\u03b11-6Man\u03b11-4GlcN, present in almost all GPI anchor structures characterized so far (Ferguson et al. 2008).",

The chromatogram (not shown) revealed the presence of a minimum of one terminal mannose, one terminal galactose, one 2-O-substituted mannose, one 2-O-substituted galactose, one 6-substituted galactose, one 2,3disubstituted mannose, one 3,6-disubstituted mannose and one 2,6-disubstituted galactose. Figure 9 shows the largest of the structures of the sVSG121 neutral glycans consistent with their GC-MS analysis and previous analyses of GPI anchors from other VSG variants (Ferguson et al. 1988;Mehlert et al. 1998). Sequence, branching and linkage types were consistent with the proposed structures of ions found by CID-MS. Since cross-ring rupture ions of permethylated glycans cannot provide structural information of 1\u21923 linkages (Reinhold et al. 1995), 3-substituted hexoses could not be detected by CID-MS. Cross-ring cleavage fragments of terminal hexoses were also absent in the CID-MS spectra, possibly due to the very weak signal of the [Me-Hex + Na] + -precursor ions. The anomeric configurations of the sugar residue that are given in Figure 9 are taken from the fully characterized sVSG221 GPI anchor (Mehlert et al. 1998) and cannot be determined by either GC-MS or CID-MS.",

Sequence information regarding the branching pattern of the GPI anchor galactose residues around the mannose core of the different glycoforms could also be obtained by ES-MS/MS. Double glycosidic cleavage ions revealed the presence of branched and linear galactose side chains from one up to five residues. However, due to the ambiguity of some glycosidic fragment ions, especially when analyzing more complex glycan structures (e.g. Gal 5 -glycoform of sVSG121), complementary analytical methods have to be taken into consideration. The data also provided an indication of hexose linkage composition by observing cross-ring fragment ions of the permethylated GPI glycans, which was consistent with results obtained by GC-MS analysis from the same material. Cross-ring cleavage ions defined the linkage types within the conserved Man\u03b11-2Man\u03b11-6Man\u03b11-4GlcN core, except for terminal hexoses, which is possibly due to the very weak signals of the [Me-Hex + Na] + -product ions by ES-MS/MS.",

            "text": "Modern ultra-high sensitive mass spectrometry is commonly used for screening samples for specific classes of analytes. In recent years, MS strategies for screening different types of oligosaccharides present in a diverse range of biological materials have been developed to investigate the glycome (North et al. 2009). Often, these methods are based on the analysis of permethylated oligosaccharides and detection of characteristic product ions upon fragmentation. A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer is well suited to screen for the presence of analytes via the use of constant neutral loss and precursor ion scan modes. Unfortunately, sensitive screening for permethylated GPI glycans in complex biological samples using neutral loss scanning is ruled out by the fact that the most abundant reporter ions generated by collision-induced dissociation result from a non-neutral loss of the D-myo-inositol residue together with the quaternary ammonium ion of the derivatized glucosamine. The principal mass transition for each permethylated GPI glycan is, therefore, from the doubly charged [M + Na] 2+ precursor ion to singly charged [(M \u2212 292) + Na] + ion, making the transition different for each value of M. On the other hand, calculated [M + Na] 2+ to [(M \u2212 292) + Na] + transitions can be used to build multiple reaction monitoring methods to sensitively search for permethylated GPI glycans of predetermined composition. The scope for precursor ion scanning for permethylated GPIs is also limited by the aforementioned dominant non-neutral loss. Thus, the intensities of all of the other product ions are relatively low (note that in the spectra shown in Figures 4, 6 and 8 the y-axis is magnified five, three and eight times, respectively, relative to the 1451.5, 1655.5 and 1859.7 [(M -292) + Na] + product ions). Furthermore, product ions that are common to all or most permethylated GPI glycans also tend to be rather nonspecific; for example, the [Me-Hex 2 + Na] + , [Hex 3 + Na] + and [Hex 4 + Na] + product ions at m/z 445, 635 and 839, respectively, could also belong to permethylated oligomannose Nlinked glycans.",
