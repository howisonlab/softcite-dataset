Our objective was to identify behavioural risk factors for diagnosis with chlamydia and gonorrhoea in this population, with a focus on the HIV status of sexual partners. Methods The OHTN Cohort Study follows people in HIV care across Ontario. We restricted the analysis to 1997 MSM who completed questionnaires in 2010-2013 at one of seven clinics that submit all chlamydia and gonorrhoea tests to the provincial public health laboratory; we obtained test results via record linkage. We estimated cumulative incidences using Kaplan-Meier methods and identified risk factors for diagnosis of a composite outcome (chlamydia or gonorrhoea infection) using Cox regression. Results At follow-up, there were 74 new chlamydia/ gonorrhoea diagnoses with a 12-month cumulative incidence of 1.7% (95% CI 1.1% to 2.2%). Risk factors for chlamydia/gonorrhoea diagnosis were: 5+ HIV-positive partners (HR=3.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 7.8; reference=none) and recreational drug use (HR=2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.9). Conclusions Heightened risks with recreational drug use and multiple HIV-positive partners suggest that chlamydia/gonorrhoea may have achieved high prevalence in certain sexual networks among HIVpositive MSM. Interventions to promote safer sex and timely testing among MSM are needed.",

            "text": "Rates of chlamydia and gonorrhoea have risen in urban centres in Canada including an increase in case reports among men who have sex with men (MSM). 1 Coinfection with HIV is particularly concerning because sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase likelihood of HIV transmission. 1 In Ontario, Canada, we previously reported demographic and clinical risk factors for new chlamydia and gonorrhoea diagnoses among an HIV clinical cohort followed from 2008 to 2011. 2 Risk was highest among MSM, particularly among younger MSM and (for gonorrhoea) among MSM with unsuppressed viral load, with little variation between ethnic groups. 2 However, full characterisation of risk requires examination of behavioural risk factors since sexual behaviour and prevalence in sexual networks drive STI risk. 'Serosorting', selecting sexual partners of the same HIV serostatus, could raise STI risk since condoms may be used less frequently, which could concentrate infection in sexual networks of HIV-positive persons. 3 Recreational drug use has also been linked to sexual risk taking. 1 4 5 Our objective was to extend our previous analysis by longitudinally exploring behavioural risk factors for diagnoses of genital chlamydia and gonorrhoea infection among HIV-positive MSM attending HIV care in Ontario, specifically focusing on the risks associated with serosorting and recreational drug use.",

Risk factors were having multiple HIV-positive partners and recreational drug use. Strengths of our analysis include a large sample, tests from a single laboratory and 98% completion rate of the sexual behaviour questionnaire. To our knowledge, our study is the first to compare longitudinal chlamydia/gonorrhoea diagnosis rates from multiple clinics among HIV-positive MSM by partners' HIV status. There are limitations. Canadian and US guidelines recommend extragenital testing if engaging in oral or rectal intercourse 2 yet such tests were rarely done in our setting, meaning we could not identify rectal or pharyngeal infection risk factors. A 3-month time frame for sexual behaviours mitigated recall error but resulted in unmeasured behaviour between annual questionnaires, potentially explaining the non-zero diagnosis rate among men reporting no partners. Measurement of recreational drug use via face-to-face interviews may have introduced social desirability bias. Voluntary participation may have introduced selection bias. The OCS under-represents recent diagnoses; however, participants are generalisable to HIV-positive persons in Ontario according to sex, region, age at diagnosis and HIV exposure category. 7 Recreational drug use was also a risk factor for chlamydia/ gonorrhoea diagnosis in cross-sectional prevalence studies executed in clinics in Madrid and the Netherlands, 4 5 which was demonstrated for genital, rectal and pharyngeal infections. The Netherlands study reported multiple partners as a risk factor for chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis combined; however, the association became null when syphilis and chlamydia/gonorrhoea were analysed separately. The Madrid study reported risk associated with serosorting, defined as having a stable HIV-positive partner, whereas in our setting having multiple HIV-positive partners was most important.",

After adjustment for HIV-positive partners, no additional risk was associated with having multiple HIV-negative/unknown partners. We propose three hypotheses. First, men may use condoms less frequently for 'poz' sex; however, we observed similar risks between condom users and non-users. Second, HIV-positive men may choose receptive anal sex with HIV-negative partners reducing their risk of genital infection; 3 however, information on seropositioning was unavailable. Third, chlamydia/gonorrhoea may have achieved high prevalence in sexual networks among HIV-positive MSM seeking other positive men, and these networks may have low connectedness with HIV-negative MSM. That half of cases had a history of syphilis suggests presence of a core group where bacterial STIs are concentrated. In a study of German MSM, HIV-positive serosorters had threefold higher odds of bacterial STIs versus those with serodiscordant partners. 8 Together with our finding of heightened risk for recreational drug use, we recommend further investigation of how 'scene' participation (eg, poz parties, bathhouses) influences STI risk. 1 Further, as more HIV-negative men use pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention, sexual networks between HIV-negative and HIV-positive men may become more connected if serosorting becomes less common, 9 resulting in more population-level transmission of bacterial STI.",
