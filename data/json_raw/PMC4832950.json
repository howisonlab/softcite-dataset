            "text": "Background: Ovarian cancer is a leading gynecological malignancy. We investigated the prognostic value of programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) in patients with ovarian cancer. Methods: Expression levels of PDCD5 mRNA and protein were examined in six ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3, CAOV3, ES2, OV1, 3AO, and HOC1A) and one normal ovarian epithelial cell line (T29) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and flow cytometry. After inducing PDCD5 induction in SKOV3 cells or treating this cell line with taxol or doxorubicin (either alone or combined), apoptosis was measured by Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining. Correlations between PDCD5 protein expression and pathological features, histological grade, FIGO stage, effective cytoreductive surgery, and serum cancer antigen-125 values were evaluated in patients with ovarian cancer. Results: PDCD5 mRNA and protein expression were downregulated in ovarian cancer cells. Recombinant human PDCD5 increased doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in SKOV3 cells (15.96 \u00b1 2.07%, vs. 3.17 \u00b1 1.45% in controls). In patients with ovarian cancer, PDCD5 expression was inversely correlated with FIGO stage, pathological grade, and patient survival (P < 0.05, R = 0.7139 for survival). Conclusions: PDCD5 expression is negatively correlated with disease progression and stage in ovarian cancer. Therefore, measuring PDCD5 expression may be a good method of determining the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients."

            "text": "Ovarian cancer is a leading gynecological malignancy, second only to cervical cancer. It is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, accounting for more deaths than endometrial and cervical cancers combined. [1] Ovarian cancer is typically asymptomatic during the early stages; this, together with its deep pelvic location, multiple morphologies, and characteristic genetic factors, frequently results in late diagnosis. Approximately, 70% of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Although the surgery is the primary treatment for early-stage ovarian cancer, cytoreductive surgery with platinum-based chemotherapy is the only option for advanced-stage cancer. Although cytoreductive surgery with chemotherapy can significantly prolong patient survival, 5-year survival rates are <30% in patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, apparently as a result of either primary or acquired drug resistance by cancer cells. Therefore, increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic regimens may improve prognoses.",

            "text": "Programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5), also called TF-1 cell apoptosis-related gene-19, was discovered at the Peking University Human Disease Center. [2] The PDCD5 gene is located on chromosome 19; its cDNA comprises 559 nucleotides. PDCD5 is highly conserved evolutionarily and is expressed in most tissues. Although PDCD5 overexpression does not induce strong cellular effects, it can enhance apoptosis when triggered by certain stimuli. For example, one study showed PDCD5 gene transfer to sensitize K562 cells to idarubicin-induced apoptosis. [3] Programmed cell death 5 expression was found to be downregulated in gastric cancer, [4] hepatocellular, carcinoma, [5] breast cancer, [6] acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, [7] and glioma. [8] However, the role of PDCD5 protein in ovarian cancer progression is not widely reported. [9] In this study, we investigated PDCD5 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissue to explore the relationship between PDCD5 and ovarian cancer. We also investigated whether PDCD5 overexpression enhances apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic regimens in ovarian cancer.",

We collected survival data from 72 of the 94 Stage III-IV ovarian cancer patients at follow-up [ Table 3], and divided the patients into low PDCD5 expression (<median value) and high PDCD5 expression (>median value) groups, according to their immunohistochemical analyses. Median overall survival was 19.5 months (95% CI: 13.63-25.37 months) for the low-PDCD5 group versus 63.5 months (95% CI: 61.15-65.85 months) for the high-PDCD5 group (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed PDCD5 levels to significantly correlate with survival time (HR: 0.00, 95% CI: 0.00-0.00; P < 0.001; Table 3). High PDCD5 protein expression was associated with significantly longer survival than for low PDCD5 expression (P < 0.001; Figure 4a). Patients with lower PDCD5 levels had significantly shorter disease-specific survival than those with higher expression. Spearman's analysis strongly associated PDCD5 expression with patient survival time (P < 0.0001, R = 0.7139; Figure 4b).",

            "text": "Programmed cell death 5 is a human gene identified via the cDNA-representative differences analysis technique described by Liu et al. [2] at Peking University Human Genomic Center. The 6-Kb PDCD5 gene, located on chromosome 19q12-q13.1, contains 6 exons and 5 introns. It encodes a 125-amino acid protein that localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. PDCD5 is expressed in more than 50 human tissues; high expression levels have been  reported in the adult heart, testis, kidney, adrenal glands, and placenta. Expression is significantly lower in embryos. Functional analyses have shown that PDCD5 stimulates tumor cell apoptosis induced by various stimuli. [3][4][5][6] When cells undergo apoptosis, PDCD5 mRNA and protein expression are elevated, and PDCD5 protein translocates to the nucleus. [7] Abnormal PDCD5 expression is associated with many diseases. Importantly, PDCD5 expression is significantly lower in tumor cells than in normal cells and correlates with tumor stage, malignancy, and prognosis. [4][5][6][7][8][9] Low PDCD5 expression correlates highly with poor prognosis for gastric cancer, clear cell kidney cancer, and chondrosarcoma. [4] These studies indicate that PDCD5 protects against tumorigenesis and tumor progression.",

            "text": "Reportedly, PDCD5 protein modulates both apoptotic and paraptotic cell death in humans and is proposed to positively regulateTip60 histone acetyltransferase and p53 transcription factor to promote apoptosis. [10][11][12] PDCD5 can also interact with other molecules such as nuclear factor-\u03baB p65 to regulate apoptosis via small heterodimer partner protein [13] and another protein, cytosolic chaperonin containing tailless complex polypeptide one, partly by inhibiting \u03b2-tubulin folding. [14] Recently, Xiao et al. [15] revealed that PDCD5 suppresses autoimmunity by modulating the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)-regulatory T cell (Treg) axis. PDCD5 may thus serve as a guardian of immunological function, and the   Programmed cell death 5 can enhance apoptotic response to certain stimuli. Recombinant human PDCD5 protein (rhPDCD5) has potent antitumor effects against chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells and may be a novel and promising agent for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia. [16] It was also shown to sensitize chondrosarcoma cells to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, by inhibiting cell growth and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. As rhPDCD5 apparently induces cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, its co-administration with cisplatin is a plausible treatment for chondrosarcoma. [17] In a human breast cancer xenograft model, intraperitoneal rhPDCD5 administration dramatically improved the antitumor effects of paclitaxel, which implies that it could be used therapeutically to enhance sensitivity to paclitaxel in breast cancer cells. [18] PDCD5 is downregulated in chondrosarcoma and might be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in chondrosarcoma patients. [19] In this study, we examined PDCD5 expression in normal ovarian tissue, benign tumors, and ovarian cancers, and the relationship between PDCD5 expression and clinical features and prognosis. We found PDCD5 was most highly expressed in normal ovarian tissue; less expressed in benign tumors and had the lowest expression in ovarian cancer tissue. PDCD5 expression was also inversely correlated with FIGO scores. Higher PDCD5 expression was associated with longer survival times for ovarian cancer patients, which accords with the results of Zhang et al. [9] In conclusion, programmed cell death 5 expression is reduced in ovarian cancer and correlates negatively with survival time. Our data indicate that low PDCD5 expression decreases apoptosis in ovarian cancer, thus promoting a poor prognosis. These results imply that PDCD5 could both offer a means of monitoring patient prognosis and be developed on the basis of an anticancer therapy.",
