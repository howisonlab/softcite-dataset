Methods: This was part of a prospective study done in the rectal cancer patients who underwent surgery with TME between November 2006 and June 2008. Consecutive uroflowmetry, post-voided residual volume, and a voiding questionnaire were performed at preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: A total of 50 patients were recruited in this study, including 28 male and 22 female. In the comparison of the preoperative data with the postoperative 3-month data, a significant decrease in mean maximal flow rate, voided volume, and post-voided residual volume were found. In the comparison with the postoperative 6-month data, however only the maximal flow rate was decreased with statistical significance (P=0.02). In the comparison between surgical methods, abdominoperineal resection patients showed delayed recovery of maximal flow rate, voided volume, and post-voided residual volume. There was no significant difference in uroflowmetry parameters with advances in rectal cancer stage. Conclusions: Voiding dysfunction is common after rectal cancer surgery but can be recovered in 6 months after surgery or earlier. Abdominoperineal resection was shown to be an unfavorable factor for postoperative voiding. Larger prospective study is needed to determine the long-term effect of rectal cancer surgery in relation to male and female baseline voiding condition.",

Survival of patients with rectal cancer has improved over the past two decades as a result of earlier diagnosis, radiotherapy and advances in surgical techniques such as total mesorectal excision (TME) [2,3]. Recently, investigations have focused more on combining a cure with improved quality of life for patients after treatment. For urogenital complications, sexual and urinary dysfunction is common complications of rectal cancer surgery [4]. These complications can have a major impact on a patient's physical, psychological, social and emotional function-ing, as well as his or her overall well-being [5]. Because the incidence of rectal cancer is highest in the sixth and seventh decades of life, voiding dysfunction can become a more important problem although several western studies demonstrated that sexuality also remains an important aspect at those ages [6,7].",

This phenomenon is due to typical effects of parasympathetic nerve damage on voiding. These effects can be transient, if the nerves are not completely divided, they are able to regenerate. Changes that persist for more than 1 year post operatively are mainly permanent, and usually consist of emptying difficulties due to a persistently noncontractile bladder [10]. In our study, the transient decrease in maximal flow rate at 3 months after the operation might be explained by postoperative inflammatory changes in the perivesical tissues and the possible resolution of partial nerve damage with time, resulting in improvement and even complete recovery [17].",

Predictive factors for post-operative bladder dysfunction include low rectal cancer ( <5 cm from the anal verge), lymph node involvement, and pre-operative urinary dysfunction [19]. Pelvic autonomic nerves can be damaged as a result of failure to identify them, either as a result of lack of anatomical knowledge or simply because of poor visibility owing to bleeding or obesity [21]. The sympathetic nerves are at risk during presacral and ventrolateral dissection of the mesorectum and central arterial ligation, and the parasympathetic nerve supply is especially at risk during deep dissection of the lateral planes. Low rectal cancer increases the risk of combined damage to the pelvic splanchnic nerves and levator ani nerves, due to the small surgical margin deep in the pelvis [22]. Inflammation following anastomotic leakage, dia thermic coagulation, sutures and radiotherapy can cause pelvic nerve damage. Radiotherapy in particular can cause demyelination and affect the autonomic nerves, leading to nerve fibrosis and dysfunction [23]. The Dutch TME trial indicated, however, that radiotherapy does not contribute to the development of urinary dysfunction after rectal cancer treatment when surgical factors are taken into account [10].",
