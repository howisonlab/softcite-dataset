            "text": "Carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the carotid body (CB) plays an important role in the maintenance of blood PO 2 and PCO 2 /pH homeostasis by regulating ventilation. It has been observed that the activity of CA in the rabbit CB is stronger under hypoxic conditions than under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. In conditions of chronic hypoxia, the volume of the CB increases significantly because the number of type I and II cells increases. So far, the number of CA molecules in the CB has not been assessed. We develop a technique to quantify the number of CA molecules in the CB. The CBs were dissected out from 8 rats, immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen, pulverized and centrifuged. The proteins extracted from CB tissue were heat-denatured and separated by electrophoresis on a 12.5% denatured-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE); a 31 kDa protein band was determined which reacted with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for rat CA-II in Western blot analysis. The immunoreactive 31 kDa CA-II protein was detected and quantified by laser scanner densitometry using 125 I-rProtein A as a tracer. The mean 125 I radioactivity emitted by the antibody bound CA-II was 31277 cpm. This value corresponds to 4.57 ng CA-II. When compared with a rat CA-II calibration curve, an average of number of 3.54 x 10 7 CA-II molecules were quantified for 1 g of whole CB tissue. This is a sensitive and accurate radioimmunoassay technique and may be useful in future studies on the role of CA-II in different pathophysiologic conditions.",

            "text": "The carotid body (CB), alternatively called \"carotid glomus\", is a small cluster of chemoreceptors and supporting cells located near the bifurcation of the carotid artery. The main function of the CB is to maintain homeostasis of blood oxygen partial pressure (PO 2 ), carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO 2 ), and acid-base balance by regulating ventilation. The chemoreceptors in the CB are innervated by a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve, which projects to the respiratory center in the brainstem. A decrease in arterial PaO 2 or an increase in PaCO 2 and acidity, when detected by the chemoreceptors, stimulates the CB nerve and activates a respiratory reflex, which leads to an increase in ventilation so as to restore normal blood PO 2 and PCO 2 /pH. The rapid response of the CB to changes in PaCO 2 /pH depends on the function of carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme found in many mammalian cells and tissues, including the CB [1,2]. CA catalyzes the hydration of CO 2 to facilitate the rapid restoration of normal intracellular pH in response to the changes in extracellular PaCO2. This chemical stimulus is coupled with a release of neurotransmitters from the CB that generates action potentials in the central nervous system's afferent nerve terminal.",

            "text": "CA was first identified in the CB by Lee and Mattenheimer in 1964  [3], and at least 14 distinct CA isozymes have been identified currently [4]. According to their cellular localizations, these isozymes have been characterized into four broad aubgroups, which, in turn consist of several isoforms: the cytosolic CAs (CA-I, CA-II, CA-III, CA-VII and CA XIII), mitochondrial CAs (CA-VA and CA-VB), secreted CAs (CA-VI) and membraneassociated CAs (CA-IV, CA-IX, CA-XII, CA-XIV and CA-XV) [5]. CA-II is found in the cytosol of cells in numerous organs. In the CB, CA-II is found in glomus or type I cells, as well as in the nerve bundles. It may also exist in vascular smooth muscle cells [6]. In the CB, the catalytic activity of CA-II isozyme is stronger than that of the other two isozymes expressed at this anatomical site, CA-I and CA-III. In the rabbit, it has been observed that the whole CA activity in the CB is stronger under hypoxic condition than under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions [7]. . However, it is still unknown whether the hypoxia-related increase in CA activity is due to increase in the specific activity of CA molecule or increase in the number of CA molecules, or both mechanisms. It would help us to better understand the role of CA in the maintenance of homeostasis if the number of CA molecules could be sensitively and accurately quantified.",

All rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 40 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium. A longitudinal incision was made in the middle cervical skin, and the regions of the carotid bifurcation were surgically exposed. Then, a left thoracotomy was made to expose the heart. A modified Tyrode's solution (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2ethanesulfonic acid/NaOH, pH 7.4) equilibrated at a given PO 2 of 20 Torr at 37\u00b0C) was perfused through the heart, maintaining the temperature at 35.5 +/-0.5 \u00b0C, until the efferent perfusate was blood-free [1]. Then, CBs were quickly dissected out and placed on a Petri dish with ice cold Tyrode's solution to remove the surrounding fat and connective tissue under a binocular microscope. Residual blood cells were carefully removed by osmotic shock and washing with MilliQ H 2 O. Finally, the CBs were frozen with liquid nitrogen, until further process for CA-II assay.",

Upon laser-induced stimulation, light was emitted from the storage phosphor screen in proportion to the amount of radioactivity in the sample. Wide linear dynamic range (5 orders of magnitude) enables quantitation and visualization of both weak and strong signals in a single exposure. After digitalization of the results, the screen was exposed to extra-bright light of ImageEraser light box and reused. A laser scanning densitometer (GS-250 Molecular Imager System; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) was used to convert the radioactive signals emitted by the immunoreactive areas on the phosphor screen into digital images for subsequent densitometric analysis by the software package Phosphor Analyst (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) [14]. The radioactive signal emitted by unloaded parallel lanes in the same gel was considered as background. CA-II quantitation was performed 4 independent experiments.",

CA catalyzes the reversible hydration-dehydration of CO 2 -HCO 3 -. Since CA activity speeds up the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 O with formation of H + and HCO 3 -, this enzyme could be responsible for the sensitivity of the CB to CO 2 by mediating the changes in extracellular pH. CB is highly sensitive to sudden changes in arterial blood PCO 2 , as well as positive or negative variations of pH [15][16][17]. The presence of CA in the CB has brought about several investigators to speculate its physiologic role in homeostasis of PO 2 , PCO 2 /pH [18][19][20]. CA activity in CB cells is essential for the speed of chemotransduction and amplitude of the initial response to CO 2 and for its subsequent actions [12,14,17]. CA was first identified in the CB by Lee and Mattenheimer in 1964 [3], and, to date, at least 14 CA isozymes have been identified by various methods [8,9,[16][17][18]21,22]. Yamamoto et al. [6] used immunoreactive assay and Western blot analysis to demonstrate the existence of CA isozymes I, II, and III in the rat CB. CA-II was mainly distributed in type I cells and nerve bundles. The results of the present study provide further evidence of CA-II in rat CB. Furthermore, the present study, at first time, provides the total number of CA-II molecules in rat CB.",

Later, Yamamoto et al. [19] identified CA isozymes I, II, and III. Porster et al. pointed out that CA-II activity is stronger than CA-I and CA-III [14]. Additionally, Foster et al. observed that CA-II mainly catalyses the CO 2 and H 2 O reaction to produce H + and HCO -3 , which is critical to bloodgas CO 2 exchange. CA-I and CA-III may play a supporting role in this process [23]. In the present study, in order to accurately identify and quantify CA in the CB of the rat, only CA-II was studied. We observed it with one-dimensional SDS PAGE electrophoresis and confirmed it with Western blot analysis using an anti-CA-II antibody and radio-labeled 125 I. Additionally, we calculated the concentration of CA-II in CB tissue. Our study demonstrates that this technique provides a sensitive and accurate way to quantify the CA molecular numbers.",

Under chronic hypoxia, the size of the CB increased significantly as a consequence of the increased number of type I and type II cells [23]. It is unclear whether the increased activity of CA or the increased volume of the CB during chronic hypoxia is due to increased efficiency of CA or to an increase in the number of CAproducing cells. The present study provides a useful technique that will enable us to measure CA concentrations directly and compare them among various conditions.",
