            "text": "The fact that European governments have grown dramatically since the end of World War II cannot be questioned. In 1960, government expenditures on average amounted to 27 percent of output, while in recent years their average size has reached almost half of the GDP (Mueller 2003;Persson 2002). In light of the heavy tax burden that a representative European citizen is consequently facing, it needs to be established why European governments can raise and enforce a claim to such a considerable share of private income. The benefit principle of taxation provides an answer to this question by stating that tax collection by a government is justified if society at large receives an adequate reimbursement in the form of publicly provided goods and services (Lindahl 1919). The empirical analysis in this paper tests whether the benefit principle is fulfilled by studying the net effect of government size on subjective well-being.",

The traditional welfare economic view assumes the existence of a benevolent and omniscient social planner who exclusively seeks to maximize social welfare and ensures the achievement of a first-best allocation of resources. However, this view has been challenged by the public choice school, which emphasizes agency problems as the source of inefficient outcomes. One of the main ideas of this school of thought is that politicians and bureaucrats pursue personal interests that give rise to a deviation from the optimal size of the public sector (Mueller 2003). Thus, by exploring how government size affects life satisfaction one is indirectly testing whether this kind of self-serving behavior is observed in reality.",

More specifically, it draws on a rich micro dataset based on the Eurobarometer Survey Series and covers twelve EU countries 3 from 1990 to 2000. Bj\u00f8rnskov et al.'s (2007) study suffers from the shortcoming that the heterogeneity in a world-wide cross-sectional study of countries such as Venezuela, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Uganda cannot be captured by just a few control variables. In addition, it is questionable whether the dependent variable of subjective well-being can be compared across such a heterogeneous set of countries (Diener and Oishi 2006). 4 Therefore, this study regards a relatively homogeneous set of EU countries and uses country fixed effects in the regression analysis. Moreover, as an extension to previous studies the analysis accounts for nonlinear effects given that the neglect of nonlinearities may be responsible for the ambiguity in the existing literature.",

In addition, left-wing voters and low-income earners appear to be the main beneficiaries of a large public sector. Further insights are gained by considering components of public spending that characterize the welfare state in a wider sense: education, health and social protection expenditures (Blomquist and Christiansen 1995;Boadway and Marchand 1995 5 ). These additional estimations bring to light that governments in the EU could have achieved higher levels of well-being by spending more on education and less on social protection.

Many of them can be attributed to specific interest groups and the ways in which they succeed in pushing through their interests.

Firstly, Niskanen (1971) puts forward a theoretical model illustrating bureaucrats' incentive to expand budgets beyond the social optimum since their non-pecuniary goals such as prestige and power are positively correlated with larger budgets for the provision of public goods. Hence, in the presence of an information asymmetry concerning the cost function of the public good the bureaucrat demands the largest budget, which the politician would approve of. As an alternative to this, Brennan and Buchanan (1980) depict the government as a Leviathan that maximizes its revenue by exploiting the tax base to the full extent. Eventually, this leads to excessively large budgets. Finally, Nordhaus (1975) discusses the existence of political business cycles where politicians -portrayed as maximizers of reelection probabilities -implement expansionary fiscal policies (such as increases in government spending) before elections in order to boost their popularity.",

The most important individual characteristics in this context are ideology and relative income. Firstly, a large public sector is more likely to be welcomed by individuals who express a preference for left-wing policy, i.e. large government size. Secondly, people who earn a relatively low income should benefit more from a large public sector as they are more likely to receive transfers and bear a comparably lower tax burden than high-income earners. Both propositions can be traced back to Meltzer and Richard's (1981) theoretical explanation for the size of government by means of a median voter model.

In particular, the empirical analysis incorporates two factors, which are related to the efficient allocation of public resources. The first one is corruption, which is defined as the 'misuse of public office for private gain' (Svensson 2005, p. 20). The inclusion of corruption in the regression analysis can be justified by referring to the evidence on corruption-induced distortions in the allocation of public funds (Gupta et al. 2001;Mauro 1998). Secondly, expenditure decentralization is likely to play a role in the relationship between government size and well-being even though the effect may go either way. Positive effects are usually attributed to an increase in efficiency through 'yardstick competition' (Besley and Case 1995) and a better targeted satisfaction of people's preferences (Oates 1972), whereas opponents of decentralization emphasize a more difficult coordination of efforts (Prud'homme 1995). In hypothesis 3, the dominance of the benefits of decentralization is presumed since there is previous evidence for a positive effect of decentralization and local autonomy on well-being (Bj\u00f8rnskov et al. 2008;Frey and Stutzer 2000a 7 ).

To allow for more depth in the analysis we make a distinction between several population groups and factor in different characteristics of the government and the shares of public spending that are allocated to redistributive purposes. direction of the European Commission and were conducted in a face-to-face setting in people's homes and in the appropriate national language. The data for the life satisfaction variable is based on the question 'On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all satisfied with the life you lead?' (the small number of respondents answering 'Don't know' and 'No answer' is ignored) measured on a scale that runs from 1 to 4, where a higher value indicates a higher level of satisfaction. Several findings in the economic and psychological literature justify using this data. First, there is mounting evidence that self-reported well-being is correlated with physical reactions such as the frequency of smiling (Ekman et al. 1990;Pavot et al. 1991) or heart rate and blood pressure reactions to stress (Shedler et al. 1993). Second, people's perceptions of their own well-being coincide with recall of positive events in life (Seidlitz et al. 1997) and reports of relatives and friends (Diener 1984;Sandvik et al. 1993). Third, experimental studies reject the hypothesis that subjects bias their response upwards due to social desirability (Konow and Earley 2008). Finally, data on subjective well-being has been shown to be negatively correlated with suicide in individual-level multivariate regressions (Daly and Wilson 2009). Figure 1 displays values for life satisfaction and government size for twelve EU countries averaged across the time period from 1990 to 2000 (and the individuals in a particular country). Denmark is clearly identified as the country where people are on average most satisfied with their lives with an average value of 3.6 on a scale that runs from 1 to 4. At the lower end of the distribution are Germany, Italy, and France with averages of at most 2.9. The order in which the  Averages of life satisfaction and government size, 1990-2000 countries appear in the bar-chart is quite stable over time and across other surveys such as the World Values Survey or the European Social Survey.",

Second, unemployment rates are incorporated into the regression analysis given that Lucas et al. (2004) find a large and persistent effect of unemployment on life satisfaction. It appears that even people, who find a job after being unemployed for a while, do not return to their initial level of life satisfaction. In this context, one has to keep in mind that the unemployment rate also captures negative effects on well-being through social problems such as crime (Edmark 2005)  9 and social exclusion. The third macroeconomic variable to be found in all estimations is inflation as a result of Di Tella et al.'s (2001) evidence that high inflation depresses well-being in the United States and Europe, even if the effect is smaller than for unemployment.",

To begin with, model 1a represents a baseline estimation without any nonlinear terms, while models 2a to 7a each take into account different combinations of interaction and quadratic terms. 14 Since there are some missing observations for the expenditure decentralization variable and since corruption data is only available as of 1995, models 3a to 7a rely on a lower number of observations than models 1a and 2a.",

On an individual level people's gender, age, relative income, ideological preferences, marital status, education level, employment status and their number of children have a significant impact on subjective wellbeing as pointed out in previous studies. In this respect models 1a to 7a provide a very coherent and robust picture. With regard to the variables at the country level, the log of GDP per capita and government expenditures have a positive linear impact on well-being. In addition, a higher unemployment or inflation rate has a significantly negative impact on well-being, while the former even goes beyond the effect of one's own employment status. Thus, unemployment reduces well-being even for employed people as they may perceive their own job to be at stake. Now let us turn to the interaction terms at the top of table 1. First of all, relative income does not have a significant effect on the relationship between public sector size and well-being since the coefficients for the relevant interaction term are insignificant in models 2a, 5a, 6a and 7a. On the other hand, the coefficients for the interaction with ideological preferences are highly significant and have the correct signs with respect to hypothesis 2. This suggests that 14. Expenditure decentralization and corruption do not enter any of the models simultaneously, since there is a strong negative correlation between the two with r 5 2 0.6.  government size has a more positive impact on subjective well-being for people with left-wing political preferences. Secondly, the coefficient for the interaction between government expenditures and expenditure decentralization is significant at the 1% level. Hence, government size has a more positive effect on well-being in countries that allow for a higher degree of local autonomy. Finally, the interaction term with regard to corruption has the expected negative sign and is significant at the 10% or 1% level, respectively. Model 7a additionally reveals a highly significant negative quadratic term for government expenditures. This suggests an inversely U-shaped relationship and diminishing returns to government size in terms of well-being.",

This has to do with the fact that the magnitudes of the coefficients have no meaningful interpretation in microeconometric estimations. The usual procedure is to calculate marginal effects which for instance summarize how an increase in government expenditures affects a person's probability to be 'very satisfied' with his or her life. However, for several reasons we abstain from making these calculations and resort to the coefficients of the OLS estimations in section IV.2. The first justification for this approach is that Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Frijters (2004) provide overwhelming evidence that results barely differ between OLS and ordered probit estimations in the context of happiness research. After all, the main difference between these two estimators is that the former assumes a cardinal interpretation of life satisfaction data, while the latter is more conservative and only presumes an ordinal ranking.",

However, none of them provides a correct interpretation of the interaction term's marginal effect. In fact, the reported results often diverge strongly from the true results.

Moreover, the hypothesis that government size has a more positive effect on well-being for left-wing voters cannot be rejected (first 15.

First, we eliminate the influence of outlying observations. Denmark stands out from the rest of the sample given that its average value for government size and especially for  average life satisfaction lead to an isolation in the top right corner in figure 1 (see section III.1). Therefore, the first robustness check excludes observations for this particular country. The underlying question is whether previous estimation results are driven by the peculiarity of Denmark's public sector and its society. Table 3 reports estimation results for six models that already appeared in tables 1 and 2. To be more exact, models 2a to 4a and 7a from the table relating to total government expenditures and models 11a and 12a from the table on expenditure subcategories are re-estimated. Since Denmark is excluded from the sample, the maximum number of observations drops from 153,268 to 132,945. Compared to the results in tables 1 and 2, the signs and levels of significance for the individual characteristics and the macroeconomic variables are in principle unaffected. There are, however, some small differences with regard to the interaction terms and expenditure subcategories. First, the interaction term between relative income and government expenditures is significant at the 5 or 10% level. This implies in line with hypothesis 2 that for individuals with a higher position in the income distribution the effect of government size on well-being is lower. Second, the coefficient for the interaction term between corruption and government expenditures is insignificant in model 4b, while it continues to be significant in model 7b. Since the latter is the more complete model, it can still be argued that the results are in support of hypothesis 3 with regard to corruption.",

If the original model is y 5 a1b 1 x1b 2 x1b 12 xz1e, the marginal effect of x on y is given by @y/@x 5 b 1 1b 12 z. As a next step, we have evaluated this effect at the sample average z. Finally, the variance of the estimated marginal effect is given by Var\u00f0@y=@x\u00de \u00bc Var\u00f0b 1 \u00de \u00fe z 2 Var\u00f0b 12 \u00de \u00fe 2 zCov\u00f0b 1 ; b 12 \u00de. The formula for the calculation of marginal effects in the presence of squared terms can be derived in a similar fashion. 19. Another noteworthy insight from the calculations in table 5 is that at mean values of government size right-wing voters are more satisfied with their lives than left-wing voters by 0.04 to 0.08 units. Furthermore, if an individual advances to the next income quartile, his or her life satisfaction increases by 0.07 to 0.08 units.",

This means that given average values for relative income, ideological preferences and corruption, the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of a larger government just outweigh each other at this level as summarized in hypothesis 1a. There are, however, several reasons why the numerical value for the optimal government size should be interpreted with caution. First, the largest government size in our sample is recorded for Sweden in 1995 with 66.3%, while none of the countries in our sample has any experience with a government of more than 70% in the time period considered here. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether such a large government would indeed contribute to people's well-being. Second, the value for the peak is quite sensitive to the exclusion of observations. If Finland or Ireland are dropped from the sample, the peak shifts down to 69.2% and 70.0%, respectively.",

Hence, there is an indirect channel for a negative effect of government size on life satisfaction which the singleequation estimations do not take into account. Dropping the log of GDP per capita from the regression equation, however, is also unreasonable as this would cause an omitted variable bias with regard to the coefficient of government expenditures. Summarizing, it is likely that the estimation of a system of equations would suggest a lower value for the optimal government size.",

In this context, Heinemann (2008) provides evidence for deteriorating welfare state ethics in the presence of generous benefits which may lead to a self-destruction of the welfare state in the long run. Fifth, even though the estimation results suggest a further extension of government size, the magnitude of the effect on subjective well-being may be as low as 0.09 given an increase of government size by 10 percentage points (see model 11d). The main message to remember from the empirical analysis is that there is robust evidence for a curvilinear relationship indicating diminishing returns to government size in terms of well-being.",

In reality, there are neither omniscient social planners who can determine the optimal government size nor do politicians exclusively follow selfish interests given their desire to be re-elected. What we can conclude is that enlargements of government size in the past have been in the best interest of citizens in the EU as one would expect in democratic societies. In addition, neither hypothesis 2 nor hypothesis 3 can be rejected. Hence, the effect of public sector size on people's well-being is strongly affected by institutional quality (degrees of decentralization and corruption) and respondents' characteristics (position in the income distribution and ideological preferences). Finally, hypothesis 4 cannot be rejected with respect to education expenditures, but with respect to social protection expenditures. This implies that the positive effect of government size on well-being is larger in countries where a large share of the budget is spent on education.",

The first finding is an inversely U-shaped relationship between government size and well-being. More detailed calculations reveal that enlargements of government size in the past have not occurred against the interests of citizens in the EU. Secondly, the quality of institutions (levels of corruption and expenditure decentralization) has on average a significantly positive impact on well-being given current sizes of governments in the EU. Thirdly, low-income earners and left-wing voters benefit the most from a larger government in terms of well-being. Finally, the governments of all twelve EU countries in the sample could have increased well-being in the period from 1990 to 2000 by spending more on education. Finland and Germany could have further boosted subjective well-being by allocating a smaller share of the public funds to social protection.",

In addition, an extension of the empirical model towards a system of equations would capture additional channels for the effect of government size on well-being and thereby yield more accurate estimates. Finally, some restrictions regarding the policy implications of the above findings are in order. As pointed out by Frey and Stutzer (2000b), entrusting government officials with the task of maximizing people's well-being may give rise to manipulations and some degree of arbitrariness in the public decision-making process. Therefore, the results in this paper should be supplemented by investigations that rely on alternative well-being indicators. The combination of results thus obtained can then inform and guide policymakers.  ",

To this end, the effect of government size on subjective well-being is estimated in a combined survey and country-level dataset covering 153,268 respondents from twelve EU countries over the 1990-2000 period. The first finding is an inversely U-shaped relationship between government size and well-being. In addition, the analysis suggests that given the high institutional quality as compared to other parts of the world there might be scope for a further enlargement of governments in the EU from a wellbeing perspective. However, one must acknowledge that the effect on well-being may be quite small and that democratic societies in Europe have no experience with even larger governments. The investigation also reveals that the impact of government size on well-being depends negatively on levels of corruption and positively on the extent of decentralization. Moreover, left-wing voters and low-income earners are the main beneficiaries of a large public sector. Finally, in all twelve EU countries included in the sample higher levels of well-being could have been achieved by allocating a higher share of public resources to education, while Finland and Germany could have given an additional boost to well-being by cutting expenditures on social protection.",
