            "text": "Aristolochic acids (AAs) are the active components of herbal drugs derived from Aristolochia species that have been used for medicinal purposes since antiquity. However, AAs have recently been discovered to be highly nephrotoxic and induced urothelial cancer in humans and malignant tumors in the kidney and urinary tract of rodents. In this study, we exposed rat renal proximal tubule cells in vitro to a sub-cytotoxic level of AAs at three different time points (6 h, 24 h and 72 h). We then analyzed the gene expression profile after the compound exposure. Functional analysis with Ingenuity Pathways Analysis and DAVID tools revealed that at the late time point (72 h) there are many significantly altered genes involved in cancer-related pathways such as p53 signaling. MIAMI-compliant microarray data are deposited in the NCBI GEO database under accession number GSE68687 and can be found at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68687."

            "text": "Herbal drugs containing aristolochic acids have been used since antiquity, however in 1982, AAs were reported to be highly carcinogenic in rats causing renal and forestomach cancers [1,2]. Later similar findings were reported in mice [3]. In 1991, a unique and rapidly progressive renal fibrosis referred as Aristolochic Acid Nephropathy (AAN), was observed in around 5% of patients that took weight-reducing pills containing AAs [4]. Over 100 cases of AAN have been identified with around half needing renal transplantation [4,5]. AA consumption (as harvest contamination) is also hypothesized to be a causative agent in the development of a similar type of kidney fibrosis with malignant transformation of the urothelium -Balkan Endemic Nephropathy [6]. To date AAs have been shown to be among the 2% of the most potent known carcinogens [7]. IARC has classified herbal remedies containing species of the genus Aristolochia as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) [8], whereas naturally occurring mixtures of AAs are classified into Group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans). AA is a direct-acting mutagen in TA100 and TA1537 Salmonella typhimurium strains, but is not mutagenic in the nitroreductase-deficient strains (TA98NR and TA100NR) [9]. AAs were found to be positive in the L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay and MN assay [10]. Renal tubular epithelial cells are very sensitive to AAs and undergo apoptosis or necrosis in response to this compound, with AAI being the more cytotoxic congener [11]. The carcinogenic effect of AAs is not fully elucidated but is associated with the formation of covalent  AA-DNA adducts. Rats treated with AAs develop mutations in p53 gene and the presence of AA-DNA adducts in renal cortex and p53 mutations in tumor tissue were reported in patients with endemic nephropathy [12].",
