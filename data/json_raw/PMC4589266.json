Sixty-one patients with mTBI (mean age = 27.08; standard deviation [SD], 8.55) underwent scanning at an average of 10 h (SD, 4.26) post-trauma along with assessment of their neuropsychological performance at an average of 4.35 h (SD, 7.08) upon full Glasgow Coma Scale recovery. Results were then compared to 19 healthy control participants (mean age = 29.05; SD, 5.84), both in the acute stage and 6 months post-trauma. DTI and neuropsychological measures between acute and chronic phases were compared, and significant differences emerged. Specifically, chronic-phase fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity values showed significant group differences in the corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, optic radiation, and genu of corpus callosum. Findings also demonstrated associations between DTI indices and neuropsychological outcome across two time points. Our results provide new evidence for the use of DTI as an imaging biomarker and indicator of WM damage occurring in the context of mTBI, and they underscore the dynamic nature of brain injury and possible biological basis of chronic neurocognitive alterations.",

            "text": "M ild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) constitutes approximately 75-85% of all brain trauma cases. 1 The longterm outcome of mTBI, however, is not well characterized owing to its considerable heterogeneity. One difficulty in accurately diagnosing mild neurotrauma relates to the frequent lack of radiological evidence to support the diagnosis, which often leads clinicians to diagnose mTBI based on clinical or cognitive symptoms known to overlap with other clinical conditions 2 (e.g., hypoglycemic or vasovagal attacks and certain subtypes of mood disorders). Among the neuropsychological alterations that are commonly reported in patients with mTBI include impairment in attention, memory, psychomotor speed, and executive functions.",

            "text": "Mild neurotrauma is associated with traumatic axonal injury (TAI), which is described as a progressive event gradually evolving from focal axonal alteration to delayed axonal disconnection. 3 Importantly, TAI is thought to represent one of the more common injuries observed in the aftermath of mTBI. 2 These subtle alterations of brain tracts or fiber pathways have been visualized using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which enables better visualization of the extent of early microstructural changes post-mTBI. 2,[4][5][6] A variety of metrics can be generated through DTI scans, including fractional anisotrophy (FA), which is a per-voxel indication of the directionality of underlying water diffusion. FA values range from 0 to 1, where FA = 0 would indicate nondirectional diffusion (completely isotropic) and FA = 1 would indicate a single direction of diffusion where the water molecules are restricted to diffusion only along a single axis (completely anisotropic). 2,7 Reduced FA in the white matter (WM) is believed to reflect a loss of integrity, indicating possible damage to myelin or the axon membrane, reduced axonal packing, and/or decreased axonal coherence. 2,8 Mean diffusivity (MD), on the other hand, describes the per-voxel average magnitude of water diffusion, regardless of diffusion direction. Differences in MD are thought to reflect overall restrictions to the movement of water diffusion, examples being the variations within the intra-and extracellular space. 9 Radial diffusivity (RD) is defined as the diffusion of water perpendicular to WM fibers, 10 which increases in response to demyelination 11 and dysmyelination. 12 Changes in axonal diameter or density can also influence changes observed in RD. 13 FA and MD values are usually inversely correlated with one another, given that myelination, which enforces directionality (thus increasing FA), also represents a restriction to overall movement (thus lowering MD). 14,15 The demyelinating changes, as evinced by the changing RD, however, are not expected to occur in the first week post-mTBI, despite the presence of axonal swelling and synaptic disruption. 16 In mTBI, widespread changes in FA are frequently observed, especially in the frontal, mid-line, and temporal regions. Studies have shown that these changes can be detected as early as a few days to weeks after neurotrauma, as well as months or even a year after the initial insult. 14,15,17 The shearing forces of trauma can breach the vascular permeability of vessels (hence rupturing them), sever fibers, and lyse cells, which deregulates the normal homeostasis of the blood-brain barrier, and usually manifests as cerebral vasogenic and cytotoxic edema. 18 Evaluation of DTI indices enables the differentiation of these edemas, 19 which is crucial to predicting long-term neurological outcomes, including neuropsychological performance (NP). Vasogenic edema commonly observed in mTBI is characterized by reduced FA, increased MD, and RD and is considered reversible. In contrast, cytotoxic edema, characterized by an increased FA, reduced MD, and RD, is considered irreversible and therefore confers a poor prognosis. 2,19,20 To date, there are few studies that have been conducted longitudinally with acute mTBI samples to help elucidate the evolution of these DTI-based changes in mTBI over time. [21][22][23][24][25] Unfortunately, existing studies have yielded generally equivocal findings. 2,15,[26][27][28][29] For example, some studies have reported decreased integrity of several tracts at different time intervals (acute and chronic), [30][31][32][33][34][35] although others report elevated FA and reduced MD in the acute stage. 16,21,36 Given that these findings may be inconsistent owing to various methodological differences, including patient recruitment, imaging protocol differences, varying intervals studied, samplesize differences, and heterogeneity of injury severities, we aimed to clarify these longitudinal DTI changes using a whole-brain WM measurement strategy with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) 37 in mTBI and control groups. From the TBSS WM skeleton of comparison across subjects, we identified significant tract changes and correlated these regions with neuropsychological performances, both at admission and 6 months postinjury, in patients with mTBI. We also examined the relationship between anatomical correlates of tracts and cognition in an effort to improve prognostic values of DTI parameters in mTBI care.",

Specifically, FA of the corona radiata (CR; t (28) = 3.497; p = 0.002; d = 0.661), anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC; t (28) = 2.582; p = 0.016; d = 0.488), CG (t(28) = 2.973; p = 0.006; d = 0.562), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF; t (28) = 2.404; p = 0.024; d = 0.454), OR (t (28) = 2.643; p = 0.014; d = 0.499), and the genu of corpus callosum (GCC; t (28) = 2.732; p = 0.011; d = 0.516) were significantly lower in the TBI group. Almost all of the MD values across the phases showed no significant changes, except the CG (t (28) = 3.189; p = 0.004; d = 0.603), which was significantly higher in the TBI group. Although the changes in PLIC across the phases were found to be statistically nonsignificant (t (28) = 1.494; p = 0.15), the effect size, however, suggests a moderate level of change (d = 0.282). Finally, there were no significant differences in RD values across time points. However, Cohen's d effect-size calculation indicated moderate effect sizes for changes in the RD of CR (t (28) = 1.582; p = 0.126; d = 0.299), CG (t (28) = 1.54; p = 0.136; d = 0.291), OR (t (28) = 1.87; p = 0.073; d = 0.353), and GCC (t(28) = 1.975; p = 0.059; d = 0.373).",

This type of cerebral edema in the early course of injury has been implicated in poor outcome, 2,18 which could explain frequently observed neuropsychological impairment months or even years after the initial trauma event. The increased FA, MD, and rather an unchanged RD in the acute phase of this study is most likely indicative of reactive astrogliosis, which is a process where fibrous astrocytes migrate to the site of injury, locally increasing the density of the cells 39 and diffusivity of the affected tissue. 39,40 Vasogenic edema occurs in the acute phase, whereas demyelination occurs later. 16 As such, even though the DTI markers for these pathogenic processes are the same, the timeframe of imaging changes rather indicate an ongoing vasogenic edema. These changes in DTI parameters were observed in the SCC, PLIC, CG, and OR (with statistically significant changes in most parameters). Other tracts, including the ALIC, SLF, and GCC, showed similar trends, although they did not reach statistical significance.

Higher FA value of the CR also negatively correlated with attention and language functions acutely. Its corresponding positive association with RD at baseline best explains the influence of reactive astrogliosis on cognition in the acute stage, as previously stated. [40][41][42] The importance of the above finding cannot be understated given that specific types of cerebral edema and gliosis in the acute phase have been implicated to negatively influence long-term neuropsychological performance in patients with mTBI. [43][44][45][46] We also found that acute-phase DTI parameters in selected WM tracts were significantly associated with chronic domain-specific cognitive deficits. This includes those of the MCP, CR, SLF, CG, GCC, and SCC and their association with specific neurocognitive functions chronically, similar to findings of other studies. [39][40][41][42]47,48 Miles and colleagues, for instance, noted that decreased FA values and increased MD values of the GCC, SCC, and PLIC during the acute phase were significantly related to executive dysfunction at 6 months follow-up. 2,47 Kumar and colleagues and Matshushita and colleagues reported similar findings involving the GCC, SCC, and NP c in their studies of mild and moderate head injury. 48,49 The mostly positive association between the unchanged or raised RD a of the MCP, CR, SLF, and CG with specific chronic deficits in attention, language, and spatial function likely reflect the long-term effects of acute vasogenic edema and reactive astrogliosis, a wellknown immune response in the immediate aftermath of central nervous system (CNS) injury. 41 It is important to note that cerebral edema and cascading gliosis usually occur concurrently and are not necessarily independent of each other. 1506 VEERAMUTHU ET AL.",

            "text": "Chronically, the continued alteration of DTI parameters, especially the FA c and RD c , implies significant changes in WM integrity, where the myelin sheath or the axonal membrane or both may have been permanently damaged. 19,20,36 This disruption may be irreversible, especially when a reduced FA c and elevated MD c and RD c are noted. 2,19 Conversely, a reduced FA c , unchanged MD, and subtly altered RD c would mean that the microstructural changes to the WM are independent of gross tissue loss. [43][44][45][46] The subtly altered RD c in this context would imply minor fiber damage without gross tissue loss. 44 Such changes have also been implicated as a part of the dual effects of gliosis. 46,50,51 FA measured at follow-up was significantly reduced, in comparison to the acute phase, with mostly unchanged MD c and subtly increased RD c across six tracts (i.e., CR, ALIC, CG, SLF, OR, and GCC). Whereas the changes observed in the ALIC and OR are indicative of possible minor fiber damage and thus vasogenic edema, the change pattern observed in CR suggests irreversible consequences of astrogliosis. The mixed association between certain neurocognitive performances in the chronic stage (e.g., executive, spatial, and language function) and FA and RD of several tracts (i.e., MCP, CR, CG, and SCC), though possibly paradoxical, is not completely unexpected. Similar observations were found in a recent study with attribution to the multifaceted chronic phase findings. 41 This included neuronal network reorganisation, 52 spurting of axons with smaller calibres, 53 glial scarring, 46,50,51,54 effects of accumulated phosypholarated neurofilaments, [55][56][57][58][59] and disruptive neurofibrillary tangles. 60 Taken together, our findings further strengthen evidence for physiogenic influences on the prolonged functional and neuropsychological sequelae in patients with mTBI. 61 Clearly, disruption of the connectomes (i.e., the connectivities between specific cortical and subcortical structures) by various neuropathological 62,63 events posttrauma and the recovery process over time requires further study.",

These fibers have an increased susceptibility to injury 64 given their relatively long length and high membrane-to-cytoplasmic ratios. 65,66 The corpus callosum, for example, as noted by Aoki and colleagues, is the major fiber bundle that enables communication between the hemispheres and is topographically organized. 27,67 The CC in general is divided into the genu (GCC), the body, and the splenium (SCC). 27 The CC has been long recognized as a frequently injured region owing to shear strain, 68 and topographical location and external accelerational forces can seriously injure the fiber. 69,70 The posterior region of the CC, namely, the SCC, often noted to be more vulnerable to injury than the anterior part (GCC), 67,[71][72][73][74] was replicated in this study as well; and the SCC was the only tract that showed statistically significant changes in all three DTI parameters at the acute stage.",

            "text": "Our findings lend support to the theory that microstructural changes occur within hours after the initial insult and affect the integrity of the WM, therefore leading to the varied manifestation of neuropsychological impairments, in agreement with some of the earlier studies reported in the literature. 31,34,41,75,76 Strengths of our study include examination within a short timeframe from time of injury to imaging and neuropsychological testing within the acute phase, as well as consistent test-retest interval at 6-month followup. Although FA and MD have been shown to be very sensitive in detecting subtle WM changes that correlate with neuropsychological findings, one other parameter that has been included in this study, namely, RD, 77 provides further insight into the presumed nature of the microstructural changes 75,78,79 given that it is sensitive to myelin integrity 23,76,80 and also other CNS immune response, such as gliosis. 41 These parameters enabled us to detect the early deep WM microstructural changes, which might otherwise be confounded by ongoing secondary damage or recovery mechanisms. Additionally, the current study is unique in its longitudinal follow-up of DTI indices and cognitive functioning at 6 months post-trauma in a large cohort of well-characterized patients with relatively homogenous types of injuries. That said, findings may be limited owing to the significant heterogenity of the trauma observed in our sample as well as possible obscuring of certain differences owing to the nature of brain morphing and averaging, which is inherent in template-based analyses. Specifically, any deviation present in a small number of voxels within a region may be hidden by the averaging and therefore lead to low sensitivity to detect FA and MD changes. 81,82 Conclusion DTI is a useful technique used to assess the integrity of WM tracts in patients who have sustained mTBI. This study found significant correlations between neuropsychological deficits and WM tract integrity both within hours of neurotrauma and again 6 months later. These associations are likely attributable to alterations in the integrity of connectomes between specific cortical areas and subcortical structures, which is not evident in conventional MRI or CT procedures. Specific WM changes, as observed through the DTI parameters, especially in the acute period, and the corresponding neuropsychological impairments among the patients in the chronic phase, highlights the need to introduce appropriate imaging techniques early in patient management protocols for early prognostication and rehabilitative intervention. Further, our findings underscore the dynamic nature of brain injury and possible biological basis of cognitive dysfunction in the context of the postconcussive syndrome.",
