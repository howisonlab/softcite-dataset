            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of hospital-associated infections in the seriously ill, and the primary agent of chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. A major obstacle to effective control of P. aeruginosa infections is its intrinsic resistance to most antibiotic classes, which results from chromosomally encoded drug-efflux systems and multiple acquired resistance mechanisms selected by years of aggressive antibiotic therapy. These factors demand new strategies and drugs to prevent and treat P. aeruginosa infections. Herein, we describe a monoclonal antibody (mAb) selection strategy on whole P. aeruginosa cells using single-chain variable fragment phage libraries derived from healthy individuals and patients convalescing from P. aeruginosa infections. This approach enabled identification of mAbs that bind three distinct epitopes on the product of the Psl. This exopolysaccharide is important for P. aeruginosa attachment to mammalian cells, and for the formation and maintenance of biofilms produced by nonmucoid and mucoid P. aeruginosa isolates. Functional screens revealed that mAbs to one epitope exhibit superior activity in opsonophagocytic killing and cell attachment assays, and confer significant protection in multiple animal models. Our results indicate that Psl is an accessible serotype-independent surface feature and promising novel protective antigen for preventing P. aeruginosa infections. Furthermore, our mAb discovery strategy holds promise for application to other bacterial pathogens.",

            "text": "Antibody therapy for serious bacterial infections using polyclonal immune antitoxin or anticapsule horse serum actually predates antibiotic use. The development of broader-spectrum antibiotics rapidly supplanted the use of horse serum for reasons of safety, convenient empirical use, and cost (Casadevall and Scharff, 1994;Casadevall and Scharff, 1995;Buchwald and Pirofski, 2003). However, widespread drug resistance is quickly reducing the number of effective antibiotics available for treatment of severe bacterial infections. Although much effort has been spent on new antibacterial target and antibiotic lead discovery, none of the currently approved antibiotic classes were derived from target-focused efforts (Fernandes, 2006;Lange et al., 2007). Indeed, there is little in the antibiotic pipeline other than next generation compounds focusing on the same targets identified decades ago using whole-cell screening (Payne et al., 2007). This worsening antibiotic resistance predicament, coupled with advancements in human mAb technologies, has led to serious consideration opsonophagocytic killing of P. aeruginosa in vitro, inhibited bacterial attachment to cultured lung epithelial cells, and provided potent prophylactic protection in multiple animal models of P. aeruginosa infection. These data indicate that Psl is a novel protective antigen and that antibodies targeting Psl might be an effective measure for prophylaxis against P. aeruginosa infections in high-risk patients. Furthermore, the phenotypic whole-cell screening approach coupled with the early relevant mechanism of action screens shows significant promise for identifying new bacterial targets and antibodies that are active against other challenging bacterial pathogens. of returning to specific antibody-based prophylaxis or therapy (Saylor et al., 2009). In particular, these drugs could be effective in preventing or treating high-risk hospital infections caused by bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is a highly adaptable opportunistic bacterium that can cause life-threatening infections. Already intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, reports of P. aeruginosa acquisition of multidrug resistance to late generation antibiotics are now common (Jovcic et al., 2011;Kunz and Brook, 2010). This reality demands new approaches and drugs to prevent and treat P. aeruginosa infections. Efforts to select protective antibodies to P. aeruginosa and other pathogens have been mostly targetcentric, focusing on bacterial surface features or virulence factors correlated with disease. Antibodies targeting P. aeruginosa O-antigen, flagella, alginate, and components of the type 3 secretion system have all shown potential, and some are currently being tested in clinical studies (D\u00f6ring et al., 1995(D\u00f6ring et al., , 2007Sawa et al., 1999;Pier et al., 2004;Neely et al., 2005;DiGiandomenico et al., 2007). However, the development of antibody phage libraries and high-throughput capabilities to identify active leads has made it possible to take a more target-indifferent approach in which desirable mAb activities are first identified, followed by elucidation. In principal, this strategy is similar to the approach used to identify the targets for all antibiotics currently approved for human use, in which leads with desirable activities were selected before their targets were identified.",

            "text": "Here, we describe a phenotypic or target indifferent strategy based on selecting human single-chain variable fragment (scFv)expressing phage on whole P. aeruginosa bacteria. After first enriching for P. aeruginosa whole-cell binding, phage derived from highly diverse antibody libraries constructed from multiple healthy subjects or convalescing P. aeruginosa-infected patients were converted to IgG1 mAbs and screened for desirable and potentially protective activities. Using this strategy, we identified mAbs that bind three distinct epitopes of P. aeruginosa Psl, an exopolysaccharide involved in host cell attachment and in the formation and maintenance of biofilms produced by both nonmucoid and mucoid strains (Friedman and Kolter, 2004;Jackson et al., 2004;Matsukawa and Greenberg, 2004;Byrd et al., 2009;Ma et al., 2009). The structure of Psl, which consists of a repeating pentasaccharide containing d-mannose, d-glucose, and l-rhamnose, was recently described (Byrd et al., 2009). Interestingly, visualization of Psl on the surface of P. aeruginosa indicates that it is anchored to the cell surface in a helical pattern; an organization that is thought to provide a scaffold for other biofilm-initiating components, as well as contributing to cell-cell interactions (Ma et al., 2009). Although synthesis and transport of Psl to the surface of P. aeruginosa has not been characterized, several proteins encoded by the Psl biosynthetic gene loci are homologous to proteins found in the Wzy-dependent biosynthesis pathway of Escherichia coli group 1 capsular polysaccharides (Franklin et al., 2011).",

Isogenic strains of PAO1 were constructed with mutations in genes responsible for O-antigen, alginate, and LPS core biosynthesis; PAO1\ue044wbpL (O-antigen deficient); PAO1\ue044wbpL/algD (O-antigen and alginate deficient); PAO1\ue044rmlC (O-antigen deficient and truncated outer core); and PAO1\ue044galU (O-antigen deficient and truncated inner core).

We tested Cam-003 binding to an isogenic PAO1\ue044pslA knockout (O-antigen and alginate positive, Pslnegative) because pslA, which is predicted to encode for a nucleotide sugar dehydrogenase (Franklin et al., 2011), is required for (Fig. 2 A). These results indicate that Cam-003 does not target the O-antigen or alginate. In addition, although these data suggest the antibodies could target the LPS core, which is a serotypeindependent antigen, we were unable to observe binding of Cam-003 to LPS purified from wild-type PAO1 by Western blot (unpublished data). Interestingly, the rmlC and galU genes, in addition to their role in LPS core monosaccharide synthesis,  (A and B) Reactivity of antibodies was determined by whole-cell ELISA on plates coated with indicated P. aeruginosa strains: (A) wildtype PAO1, PAO1\ue044wbpL, PAO1\ue044wbpL\ue044algD, PAO1\ue044rmlC, and PAO1\ue044galU, and (B) PAO1\ue044pslA. In B, mAb (Genway Biosciences) specific to a P. aeruginosa outer membrane protein was used as a positive control. (C) FACS binding analysis of Cam-003 to PAO1 and PAO1\ue044pslA. Cam-003 is indicated by a green line; an isotype matched non-P. aeruginosaspecific human IgG1 antibody was used as a negative control and is indicated by the blue line. Washed cells were stained with BacLight to differentiate live from dead cells. Staining with the secondary antibody alone plus BacLight was used as an additional control. (D) LPS purified from PAO1 and PAO1\ue044pslA was resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antisera derived from mice vaccinated with PAO1\ue044wapR\ue044algD, a double mutant strain deficient in O-antigen transport to the outer membrane and alginate production.

(F and G) Opsonophagocytosis assay using Cam-003 and negative control R347 with indicated luminescent (lux) strains of P. aeruginosa (F) or strains complemented with pUCP+pslA (G). R347 was used as a negative control in all experiments. (A-C, F, and G). (A-G) Results are representative data from three independent experiments. serotype-independent anti-P. aeruginosa mAbs selected during phenotypic screening were shown by ELISA to not bind PAO1\ue044pslA, in contrast to wild-type PAO1, indicating that the remaining mAbs also targeted Psl (unpublished data). To confirm these results, we performed a Psl capture binding assay with proteinase K-treated enriched carbohydrate purified from PAO1 \ue044wbpL/algD/pelA (O-antigen, alginate, and Pel exopolysaccharide deficient) using a ForteBio Octet instrument. In this assay, individual antibodies were bound to aminopropylsilane biosensors, followed by blocking and the addition of enriched carbohydrate (capture of antigen). After washing to remove unbound antigen, binding of unlabeled mAbs was assessed. All antibodies (Cam-003, Cam-004, Cam-005, WapR-001, WapR-002, WapR-003, WapR-007, and WapR-016), with the exception of the control mAb R347, were capable of capturing antigen that strongly reacted with Cam-003, WapR-001, WapR-002, WapR-003, and WapR-016 ( Fig. 3). Interestingly, minimal reactivity to captured Psl was observed with Cam-004, Cam-005, and WapR-007, even though all three of these antibodies captured sufficient Psl to potently react with Psl biosynthesis (Byrd et al., 2009). Cam-003 failed to bind PAO1\ue044pslA when tested by ELISA and FACS (Fig. 2,B and C), and also failed to mediate OPK of this mutant (Fig. 2 F). In addition, Western blot analysis of LPS extracted from PAO1 and PAO1\ue044pslA using antisera from PAO1-vaccinated mice revealed the LPS binding pattern of this mutant to be comparable to wild-type PAO1 (Fig. 2 D), confirming that the LPS of PAO1\ue044pslA was intact and not the target of Cam-003. Binding of Cam-003 was restored in a PAO1\ue044wbpL/algD/pslA (O-antigen-, alginate-, and Psl-deficient) triple mutant complemented with pslA expressed from a P. aeruginosa expression plasmid (Fig. 2 E), as was the ability of Cam-003 to mediate opsonic killing of complemented PAO1\ue044pslA (Fig. 2 G). We also evaluated Cam-003 binding to PAO1\ue044pelA, which is deficient in expression of the Pel exopolysaccharide, a glucose-rich polysaccharide polymer that is also known to play a role in P. aeruginosa biofilm formation (Friedman and Kolter, 2004;Colvin et al., 2011). Cam-003 binding to PAO1\ue044pelA was similar to PAO1\ue044wbpL/algD and the PAO1\ue044wbpL/algD/pslA triple mutant complemented with pslA ( Fig. 2 E). The remaining To confirm that all of the antibodies bound the same antigen, we developed a capture binding assay using an Octet platform with total carbohydrate extracts prepared from P. aeruginosa, which was deficient in O-antigen, alginate, and Pel polysaccharide production. In addition, the enriched carbohydrate extract was exhaustively digested with proteinase K. Antibodies were bound to aminopropylsilane sensors, followed by the addition of enriched carbohydrate. After washing, binding of the other indicated mAbs to mAb-captured carbohydrate (Psl exopolysaccharide) was assessed. (A-I) Data are representative results from three independent experiments.",

Given these characteristics, we tested whether anti-Psl antibodies prevented P. aeruginosa association with epithelial cells. With the exception of Cam-005 and WapR-007, all antibodies reduced association of PAO1.lux with A549 human pulmonary epithelial cells (Fig. 1 D). As in the OPK assays, Cam-003 was also the most active at inhibiting cell attachment, providing an \ue07a80% reduction compared with the negative control ( Fig. 1 D and Table 1). WapR-016 was the second most active antibody, exhibiting similar inhibitory activity as Cam-003 but at \ue07a10-fold higher antibody concentration. To test if Psl expression is maintained in vivo, BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with P. aeruginosa isolates, followed by harvesting of bacteria by peritoneal lavage 4 h after infection. The presence of Psl was analyzed with a control antibody and Cam-003 by FACS.

            "text": "In vivo protection afforded by anti-Psl mAb Cam-003 Given the superior activity of Cam-003 in the OPK and cell attachment assays (Fig. 1, A-D), we focused on evaluation of this mAb in vivo. Cam-003 was evaluated in a mouse acute lethal pneumonia model against P. aeruginosa strains representing the most dominant serotypes associated with clinical disease. In these experiments, mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of mAb 24 h before intranasal infection with different strains of P. aeruginosa including the pslA knockout strain, PAO1\ue044pslA. Cam-003 provided potent protection to strain PAO1 at both 15 and 5mg/kg while providing significant concentration-dependant survival in mice infected with strain 6294 compared with control mAb-treated animals (Fig. 5,A and C). No protection was observed to the Psl mutant strain, PAO1\ue044pslA, which was used as a negative infection, bacteria were recovered from the mice by peritoneal lavage and analyzed for Cam-003 staining by FACS. All of the wild-type P. aeruginosa strains collected 4 h after infection showed strong Cam-003 staining, which was comparable to log phase cultured bacteria (Fig. 4, A and C). In contrast, no Cam-003 binding was observed with PAO1\ue044pslA collected from the peritoneal cavities of infected mice (Fig. 4 C). At 24 h after infection, an insufficient number of intact viable bacteria were harvested from the mice to allow FACS analysis of Psl expression/accessibility. However, Cam-003 reactivity was observed by ELISA for peritoneal lavage samples of PAO1, 6206, and 6077 at 24 h after infection, indicating that Psl was still present in these samples (unpublished data). We next assessed the level of Psl expression/accessibility on the surface of P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and 6206 in the acute pneumonia model. Bacteria were prepared from overnight-incubated, confluent plates as described in the previous paragraph, intranasally administered to mice, and then recovered from the lungs by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at 4 and 24 h after infection. Strong Cam-003 staining was observed for PAO1 at 4 h after infection, but was minimal for 6206 at Figure 5. Psl mAb Cam-003 protects mice against lethal challenge in a P. aeruginosa acute pneumonia model. In each experiment, BALB/c mice were treated with PBS (B-D) or antibody (Cam-003 or negative control R347; A-D) 24 h before intranasal infection with PAO1 (4.4e7 CFU) and PAO1\ue044pslA (3e7 CFU; A), 33356 (3e7 CFU; B), 6294 (7e6 CFU; C), or 6077 (1e6 CFU; D). Animals were monitored for survival between 72 and 120 h after infection. In all experiments, PBS and R347 served as negative controls. (A) A PBS control was not tested in this experiment because previous results indicated no difference in survival versus mice treated with R347. In its place, we used challenge with PAO1\ue044pslA as an additional control. Results are represented as Kaplan-Meier survival curves; differences in survival were calculated by the log-rank test for Cam-003 versus R347. (A) Cam-003 (15 mg/kg, P = 0.0028; 5 mg/kg, P = 0.0028); (B) Cam-003 (45 mg/kg, P = 0.0012; 15 mg/kg, P = 0.0012; 5 mg/kg, P = 0.0373); (C) Cam-003 (45 mg/kg, P = 0.0007; 15 mg/kg, P = 0.0019; 5 mg/kg, P = 0.0212); (D) Cam-003 (45 mg/kg, P < 0.0001; 15 mg/kg, P < 0.0001; 5 mg/kg, P = 0.0001). 10 animals were used in each group.

It should be noted that in this high challenge dose acute lethal pneumonia model, endotoxic shock is a substantial component of the pathogenicity and an isogenic Psl null strain is comparable or even more lethal in comparison to the wild-type strain. Complete protection from challenge with strain ATCC 33356 or the cytotoxic strain 6077 was afforded by Cam-003 at 45 and 15 mg/kg while 80 and 90% survival was observed at 5mg/kg for ATCC 33356 and 6077, respectively (Fig. 5, B and D). The level of protection afforded by Cam-003 against strain 6077 was particularly impressive since this strain is \ue07a200-fold more pathogenic than strain PAO1, ATCC 33356, and 6294. The increased pathogenicity of 6077 is due to the presence of the type 3 secretion system protein, ExoU, which harbors potent phospholipase activity when delivered to host cells (Sato et al., 2003). The enhanced protection observed against this strain is likely explained by Figure 6. Anti-Psl mAb, Cam-003, reduces organ burden after induction of acute pneumonia. BALB/c mice were treated with antibody 24 h before infection with PAO1 (1.1e7 CFU; A), 33356 (1e7 CFU; B), 6294 (6.25e6; C), and 6077 (1e6 CFU; D). 24 h after infection, animals were euthanized, followed by harvesting of organs for identification of viable CFUs.

Although Cam-003-TM exhibited a fivefold reduction in OPK activity compared with Cam-003 (EC 50 of 0.354 and 0.064, respectively), inhibition of cell attachment was comparable for Cam-003 to attach and colonize damaged epithelial cells.

All antibodies shown to bind multiple P. aeruginosa serotypes were determined to target the Psl exopolysaccharide, suggesting that Psl is ubiquitous and readily accessible on the surface of P. aeruginosa. Although the greatest clonal enrichment, broadest coverage of multiple Psl epitopes, and highest affinity anti-Psl mAbs were isolated from the phage library derived from P. aeruginosa-infected convalescing patients, it is noteworthy that the convalescent patient library did not yield significantly more OPK active antibodies. It is tempting to speculate that expansion of pathogen-specific antibody subsets in infected patients are not necessarily directed to the most protective epitopes. Therefore, to identify mAbs with the greatest protective activity, it is important to implement functional activity assays, such as those described herein, as early as possible in the and Cam-003-TM (Fig. 8, A and B). When tested in the mouse acute pneumonia model, Cam-003-TM was similar in potency to Cam-003 at a low infectious inoculum of 6077 (2.4 \u00d7 10 5 CFU; Fig. 8 C). However, further titration of the antibody dose followed by challenge with a larger infectious inoculum (1.07 \u00d7 10 6 ) revealed that Cam-003 activity was superior to Cam-003-TM, suggesting that OPK activity significantly contributes to optimal protection in vivo (Fig. 8 D).",

            "text": "In this study, we used a phenotypic whole-cell selection approach to identify serotype-independent mAbs that mediated OPK activity against P. aeruginosa and inhibited attachment to epithelial cells. The most active antibody in both the OPK and cell attachments assays described in this study, Cam-003, was also shown to be prophylactically protective in three distinct clinically relevant P. aeruginosa murine infection models: pneumonia, thermal injury, and ocular keratitis, which emphasizes the different aspects of opportunistic P. aeruginosa infections. Although whole-cell phage panning approaches have 2005; Ryder et al., 2007) and has more recently been shown to serve as an essential scaffold in biofilms produced by alginatesecreting mucoid bacteria (Ma et al., 2012;Yang et al., 2012). Psl is also reported to be involved in facilitating attachment of P. aeruginosa to epithelial cells and in forming/maintaining biofilms in vivo (Jackson et al., 2004;Ma et al., 2009;Borlee et al., 2010). In addition, very recent studies show that Psl inhibits efficient opsonization, resulting in reduced neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species and decreased killing by phagocytic cells, providing a distinct survival advantage in vivo (Mishra et al., 2012). The preponderance of evidence cited above and elsewhere certainly suggests potential rationale and data for survival advantages conferred to P. aeruginosa by Psl during infection. Furthermore, the current literature and our own studies support Psl as a colonization or persistence-by-enhancing determinant for the bacteria, and not a virulence-or acute lethality-enhancing feature. We showed that strain PAO1\ue044pslA is at least comparable or even marginally more lethal than wild-type PAO1 when used to induce acute pneumonia in mice. In this model, which requires a high challenge dose of bacteria, onset of endotoxic shock is considered a substantial component contributing to lethality. Our observation with the Psl mutant strain in the acute pneumonia model is supported by recent findings using a chinchilla model of otitis media, which emphasizes a longer term infection to study in vivo biofilm formation. Using this chronic infection model, Byrd et al. (2011) reported that P. aeruginosa proliferates from a low-challenge dose in which high levels of Psl expression were observed within in vivo biofilms, supporting the persistence observed with Psl-positive strains. In comparison, Psl knockouts are comparably or marginally more virulent in this chronic model while producing less bulky biofilms (Byrd et al., 2011). Moreover, studies investigating regulation of Psl exopolysaccharide expression indicate that type 3 secretion expression for injection of known cytotoxic virulence factors are conversely regulated at least in part by RsmA, further suggesting a coordinated balance between persistence and more virulent cytotoxic mechanisms (Irie et al., 2010;Moscoso et al., 2011).",

The structure of Psl was only recently elucidated as a mannose-rich repeating pentasaccharide (Byrd et al., 2009;Kocharova et al., 1988). Despite its repetitive nature, our data demonstrated the presence of at least three distinct Psl epitopes. Antibody Cam-003, which bound the class I epitope, had the greatest anti-P. aeruginosa activity in the OPK and cell attachment assays of all the anti-Psl mAbs tested. Interestingly, mAbs targeting the class I epitope had lower affinities for Psl than mAbs to other epitopes (Table 1). Given the repetitive nature of the Psl structure, which likely would lead to an increase in mAb avidity upon binding, it was surprising that mAbs harboring the greatest affinities (class II and III) did not correlate with increased OPK activity. Opsonophagocytosis mechanisms are exquisitely complex and involve a variety of opsonins and screening procedure while monitoring the progressive enrichment of specific phage by binding. Furthermore, our data suggests that it is most advantageous to use multiple independent phage libraries possessing high diversity. Cam-003 was selected from the phage library derived from healthy human subjects; however, it is possible that the individuals from which these libraries were constructed could have been exposed to environmental P. aeruginosa at some point in their lives.",

            "text": "One of the greatest technical challenges for the development of mAbs targeting bacterial pathogens is identification of serotype-independent antigens consistently expressed by the majority of clinical isolates and in the different tissues or disease stages caused by the pathogen. For P. aeruginosa, serotype-specific protection against acute infections can be achieved with O-antigen specific mAbs, although mAbs targeting serotype-independent protective targets, such as PcrV and alginate, have also been investigated (Sawa et al., 1999;Pier et al., 2004;Neely et al., 2005). In the case of PcrV, the surface-associated expression levels are not as robust as Psl (Ma et al., 2009;Sato et al., 2011), and antibodies targeting PcrV, in contrast to anti-Psl mAbs, do not promote opsonophagocytic killing of P. aeruginosa, which is an important mechanism of clearance, particularly in a mucosal setting. In contrast to alginate expression, which arises in vivo in chronically infected patients because of mutations in the negative regulator mucA (Martin et al., 1993), Psl expression is thought to be constitutively present on the surface of planktonic cells (Overhage et al., 2005;Campisano et al., 2006;Ghafoor et al., 2011). Importantly, the planktonic phenotype of P. aeruginosa, which is characterized by expression of smooth-LPS, as well as other cell surfaceassociated virulence factors, is believed to be important for initial colonization (Hancock et al., 1983;Burns et al., 2001). Furthermore, we show expression of Psl was maintained or upregulated on the surface of all wild-type strains recovered 4 h after intraperitoneal infection. Likewise, Psl was accessible on the surface of P. aeruginosa recovered from the lungs of mice 24 h after intranasal administration. These results indicate that Psl expression is maintained or accessible during acute pneumonia at least 24 h after infection (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "P. aeruginosa is a ubiquitous, extremely versatile freeliving environmental bacterium. Among its diverse lifestyles, enabled by its comparatively large bacterial genome, is its ability to colonize, persist, proliferate, and cause serious disease in individuals with damaged tissue or compromised immune defense mechanisms (Stover et al., 2000). Given the very high frequency of Psl expression observed in primary P. aeruginosa clinical isolates associated with acute clinical disease, it is likely that this unique exopolysaccharide offers general survival advantages to this environmental bacterium in the variety of conditions it encounters in its lifestyle including the human host. In addition to prevalent expression in planktonic, free-living P. aeruginosa, Psl has been shown in to be present in the biofilm matrix secreted by nonmucoid sessile bacteria in vitro (Ma et al., 2009;Overhage et al., and is expressed in a variety of the diverse phenotypes, including P. aeruginosa in vivo biofilms and small colony variants (Byrd et al., 2011;Ma et al., 2012;Yang et al., 2012). Thus, targeting Psl to prevent infections in patients known to be at high risk of contracting acute or chronic P. aeruginosa infections likely holds more promise than actual treatment of an established, phenotypically diverse complex chronic infection. Ultimately, effective treatment of active persistent P. aeruginosa infections, particularly in the CF lung, will likely require multiple drug entities (small molecule antibiotic and biological) with distinct mechanisms of action to cover the strain diversity and phenotypes associated with the different microenvironments, stages of infection and spectrum of diseases caused by the pathogen. The potential and rationale for an adjunctive use of an anti-Psl mAb in combination with antibiotics seems attractive, particularly for acute infections. First, adding OPK clearance to an antibiotic's direct antibacterial activity could reduce excessive harmful pathogen-host interactions that elicit hyperinflammatory host innate immune responses, leading to sepsis. Second, the inhibition of adherence or formation of denser biofilms could aid in preventing the establishment of a more persistent biofilm-based, antibiotic-refractory infections from a primary acute infection. However, more study is required in multiple animal models with multiple antibiotics and diverse strain types to investigate this potential anti-Psl application in adjunctive therapy. It is conceivable that the best approach to controlling P. aeruginosa infections in high risk patients may indeed be preventing them. Although the current study's findings characterizing protective anti-Psl antibodies also support Psl as a vaccine antigen, further definition of the class I Pslassociated epitope could advance efforts to focus the most protective immune response on the right epitope.",

Heat-killed P. aeruginosa (10 9 ) was immobilized in receptors that work in concert to promote internalization of microorganisms (Underhill and Ozinsky, 2002). Opsonophagocytosis of P. aeruginosa requires complement fixation, particularly C3b, and engagement of both complement and Fc\ue067 receptors. Whether other cellular receptors are involved or if the different classes of Psl antibodies facilitate interactions with complement, Fc\ue067, or other receptors that mediate activity are currently unknown. Work is under way to identify the Psl binding requirements for each anti-Psl mAb class, which could shed light on their differing ability to promote killing of P. aeruginosa.",

Cam-003-TM had reduced OPK activity but inhibited cell attachment to the same level as the parental mAb. When compared in the mouse pneumonia model to Cam-003, Cam-003-TM efficacy was inferior, suggesting that full competency in the ability to mediate OPK is necessary for optimal anti-Psl-mediated protection against P. aeruginosa in the lung. Although inhibition of cell attachment activity may contribute to protection, these data underscore OPK activity to the Psl epitope as an important in vivo mechanism of action.",

In this study, we observed Psl expression in a high percentage (96%) of clinical isolates derived from confirmed acute infections. Although only a small fraction of the total cases worldwide are chronic infections in CF patients, P. aeruginosa is the direst threat to this patient population, as most CF patients eventually succumb to the progressive damage caused by chronic P. aeruginosa infections. Although Psl expression was also observed in a majority of both mucoid and nonmucoid CF clinical isolates, overall Psl elaboration in diverse CF isolates was less prevalent (73%) than observed for acute isolates. The long-term establishment of a chronic P. aeruginosa infection in the CF lung occurs by a process termed adaptive radiation in which the originally infecting strain undergoes a wide variety of genotypic and phenotypic changes in the face of antibiotic and host selective pressures (Hogardt and Heesemann, 2010). This process results in both metabolic and antigenic changes, conferring an overall advantage for the P. aeruginosa population in the diverse microenvironmental niches of the inflamed CF lung (Hogardt and Heesemann, 2010). Although this could suggest less potential for anti-Psl monotherapeutic treatment of an active CF or other established chronic P. aeruginosa infections, mounting evidence strongly suggests that in addition to the prevalent Psl expression in the primary infecting strain, Psl has been implicated in establishing a persistent infection OPK assays. Assays were performed as previously described, with modifications (DiGiandomenico et al., 2004). In brief, assays were performed in 96-well plates using 0.025 ml of each OPK component: P. aeruginosa strains from log-phase cultures diluted to \ue07a2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml; diluted baby rabbit serum (1:10); differentiated HL-60 cells (2e7 cells/ml) as the polymorphonuclear leukocyte source; and mAb (final concentrations as indicated in Fig. 1). In some OPK assays, luminescent P. aeruginosa, which were constructed as previously described (Choi et al., 2005). Luminescent OPK assays were performed as previously described (DiGiandomenico et al., 2004), but with determination of relative luciferase units (RLUs) using an Envision Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer). The percentage of killing was determined by comparing the number of colonies or RLUs derived from assays lacking mAb to the number of colonies or RLUs obtained from assays with anti-Psl mAbs or the control R347 mAb. P. aeruginosa cell attachment assay. Antibodies were added to confluent A549 cells grown in opaque 96-well plates (Nunc Nunclon Delta). Log-phase luminescent PAO1 was added at an MOI of 10. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, cells were washed, followed by the addition of 0.05 ml of LB + 0.5% glucose. Bacterial RLUs were quantified using an Envision Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer) after a 15-min incubation at 37\u00b0C. Measurements from wells without A549 cells were used to correct for nonspecific binding.",

Unlabeled antibodies (10 \u00b5g/ml) were then flowed over the sensors. All steps were performed using a 3-mm sensor offset with 0.6 Hz sensitivity. Data were exported to Prism (GraphPad) for analysis of binding and for Global Association/Disassociation affinity curve fitting.",
