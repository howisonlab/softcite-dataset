            "text": "Allergic asthma is a chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease characterized by reversible airway obstruction, hyperresponsiveness and eosinophils infiltration. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) signaling are closely associated with asthma and have emerged as a novel therapeutic target in allergic disease. The functions of TLR3 and TLR4 in allergic airway inflammation have been studied; however, the precise role of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF), the adaptor molecule for both TLR3 and TLR4, is not yet fully understood. To investigate this, we developed a mouse model of OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation and compared the severity of allergic airway inflammation in WT and TRIF \u2212/\u2212 mice. Histopathological assessment revealed that the severity of inflammation in airway inflammation in TRIF-deficient mice was comparable to that in WT mice. The total number of cells recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid did not differ between WT and TRIF-deficient mice. Moreover, TRIF deficiency did not affect Th1 and Th2 cytokine production in lung tissue nor the level of serum OVA-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2c. These findings suggest that TRIF-mediated signaling may not be critical for the development of allergic airway inflammation.",

            "text": "Asthma is a chronic lung disease afflicting over 300 million people and its prevalence is increasing (1). Airway inflammation is a major symptom of allergic asthma and can lead to the remodeling of airway walls, resulting in airway obstruction, mucus hypersecretion and airway hyperreactivity (2,3). It is generally accepted that Th2-immune responses to allergen are responsible for the development of allergic asthma (4). Th2-mediated immune responses favor humoral antibody production, characterized by the secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and these cytokines are essential for the development of allergen-specific IgE producing-B cells (4). Antigenspecific IgE interacts with mast cells and basophils via the high-affinity Fc\u03b5 receptor (Fc\u03b5RI), resulting in the release of histamine, prostaglandin, leukotrienes, proteases, growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines that exacerbate asthma (5).",

Insufficient stimulation of Th1 cells induced by limited exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens during early childhood cannot counterbalance the expansion of Th2 cells and results in a predisposition to allergy (6).

Stimulation of TLR4 expressed by airway stromal cells promotes cytokine production that mediates the maturation of Th2-polarized lung DC (17).

Viral infection of the airway commonly aggravates allergic asthma (27). Human rhinovirus (HRV) is associated with the exacerbation of asthma in both children and adults (28,29). In addition, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection induces a lower IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 ratio and contributes to the polarization of Th2-biased immune responses and the production of IL-13-mediated AHR (27,30). The role of bacterial infection in allergic asthma is controversial. Recent studies showed that bacterial infections are associated with the exacerbation of asthma and exposure to LPS enhances the Th2 response to inhaled allergens (14,(31)(32)(33)(34)(35). In contrast, epidemiological studies suggest that insufficient Th1 immune response induced by infection in infancy is related to development of allergic disease (6). In addition, exposure to airborne endotoxin attenuated asthma by promoting enhanced Th1 response and tolerance to allergens (36).",

To develop novel drugs for asthma, the role of molecules associated with TLR signaling in allergic asthma must be defined. Although the role of TRIF, an adaptor molecule of TLR3 and TLR4, which recognize viral RNA and bacterial LPS, respectively, in allergic asthma has been studied (15,38,39), its function is not yet fully understood. Deficiency of TRIF shows contrasting effects, depending on the animal model and experimental conditions used. In a pollen-induced asthma model, TRIF deficiency results in the exacerbation of airway inflammation by augmenting the total number of BAL inflammatory cells and increasing of chemokines KC and eotaxin in BAL fluid compared with those in BAL fluid of WT mice (38). However, TRIF deficiency reduces IL-17 associated with neutrophilic asthma in an OVA-induced model of allergic airway inflammation (40). Interestingly, in some studies, TRIF deficiency did not have any effect on airway inflammation or the asthmatic phenotype in murine models of OVA-induced asthma (15,18).",

The histopathological scores, total inflammatory cells in BAL fluid, the production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in lung tissue, and levels of OVA-specific immunoglobulin in TRIF \u2212/\u2212 mice were comparable to those observed in WT mice. These results suggest that TRIF deficiency did not affect on the development of airway inflammation in OVA in murine models of OVA-induced asthma.",
