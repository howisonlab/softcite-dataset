            "text": "Hereditary cataracts are clinically and genetically heterogeneous lens diseases that cause a significant proportion of visual impairment and blindness in children. Human cataracts have been linked with mutations in two genes, GJA3 and GJA8, respectively. To identify the causative mutation in a family with hereditary cataracts, family members were screened for mutations by PCR for both genes. Sequencing the coding regions of GJA8, coding for connexin 50, revealed a C. A transversion at nucleotide 264, which caused p.P88T mutation. To dissect the molecular consequences of this mutation, plasmids carrying wild-type and mutant mouse ORFs of Gja8 were generated and ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells and human lens epithelial cells, respectively. The recombinant proteins were assessed by confocal microscopy and Western blotting. The results demonstrate that the molecular consequences of the p.P88T mutation in GJA8 include changes in connexin 50 protein localization patterns, accumulation of mutant protein, and increased cell growth. Results Clinical data. The family comprised 4 affected individuals from a four generation pedigree(Figure 1A).The proband is a 17-year-old male (IV: 3). His phenotype is bilateral complete opacification of the fetal, infantile, and adult nucleus and the cortex, and its phenotype is of total cataracts (Figure 1B), with low vision (20/200). Other family members have similar cataracts patterns. There was no family history of other ocular or systemic abnormalities. Hospital records indicated that the opacity either was present at birth or developed during the first few months of life usually, but did not progress with age."

Types of cataracts can be defined by the age at onset: congenital, juvenile, presenile and senile or age-related cataracts. Congenital cataracts are responsible for 10-30% of childhood blindness [1][2][3] . They can be subdivided according to their anatomical location within the lens, their appearance, and most commonly by a combination of these two parameters 1,4 . Congenital cataracts are a genetically heterogeneous lens disease. Currently, there are about 39 genetic loci identified as causing isolated or primary cataracts have been mapped and 18 distinct genes responsible for nonsyndromic hereditary cataracts have been identified including BFSP1, BFSP2, CHMP4B, CRYAA, CRYAB, CRYBA1/A3, CRYBA4, CRYBB1, CRYBB2, CRYBB3, CRYGC, CRYGD, CRYGS, GJA3, GJA8, HSF4, LIM2, MAF, MIP, PITX3 and LIM2 [5][6][7][8] .",

Direct cycle sequencing of the amplified fragments of the GJA8 gene in one affected individual (IV: 3) identified a C . A transversion in exon 2 at nucleotide 264 ( Figure 2A) with no other changes in the coding sequence of GJA8. This transversion caused a substitution of Threonine (T) for Proline (P) at codon 88 (p.P88T). Results of additional sequencing demonstrated that this mutation cosegregated with all affected individuals in the family, and was not observed in any of the unaffected family members. Denaturing HPLC analysis confirmed this mutation, which cosegregated with all affected individuals in the family, and this mutation was not observed in any of the unaffected family members or 100 normal controls. The remainder of the coding sequence, including that of GJA3, did not show any sequence change.

Our initial hypothesis is that the mutation may just disrupt the location of the protein, causing the mutant protein to predominantly localize in the cytoplasm, compared to localization of the wild-type protein in the cellular membrane. But both wild-type and mutant recombinant proteins are localized to the cytoplasm and cell membrane (Figure 4; supplementary Figure S1).
