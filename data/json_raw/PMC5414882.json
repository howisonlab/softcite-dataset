This \"immunogenic cell death\" requires calreticulin (CRT) translocation to the plasma membrane, which has been shown to promote cancer cell phagocytosis. However, it remains unclear whether the effect of CRT on cancer cell phagocytosis is alone sufficient to affect tumor immunity. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells expressing cell-surface CRT were generated in order to characterize the mechanism(s) through which CRT activates tumor immune responses. Potent immune-mediated control or rejection of AML was observed in mice with CRT-expressing leukemia. The \"CRT effect\" was ultimately T-cell dependent, but dendritic cells (DCs), and CD8a C DCs in particular, were also necessary, indicating that CRT might act directly on these DCs. CRT-expressing AML cells were slightly more susceptible to phagocytosis by DCs in vivo, but this effect was unlikely to explain the potent immunity observed. CRT did not affect classical DC maturation markers, but induced expression of type I interferon (IFN), which was critical for its positive effect on survival. In conclusion, CRT functions as a \"danger signal\" that promotes a host type I IFN response associated with the induction of potent leukemia-specific T-cell immunity.",

            "text": "A major unanswered question regarding CRT is whether its effect on tumor immunity depends exclusively on its ability to enhance cancer cell engulfment. By inducing phagocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells by APCs, CRT might promote cross-presentation of tumor antigens to T cells. However, antigen cross-presentation by immature dendritic cells (DCs) results in T-cell tolerance, rather than activation. 8 We therefore hypothesized that CRT might also directly stimulate APCs, leading to increased cross-priming of tumor-specific T cells. In support of this hypothesis, soluble CRT was recently shown to stimulate production of NF-kB-related cytokines by peritoneal macrophages in a CD91-dependent manner. 9 Increased cell-surface CRT exposure on malignant cells has been reported in a number of human cancers, 7,[10][11][12] including acute myeloid leukemia. 7,13 In a recent study, the degree of cellsurface CRT expression on human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells was found to correlate with enhanced T-cell immunity to AML-associated antigens and improved clinical outcomes. 14 In addition, our laboratory is interested in characterizing pathways that promote innate immune sensing of AML. 15 With these notions in mind, we sought to investigate mechanisms through which CRT translocation on AML cells might promote anti-leukemia immunity. Thus, AML cells with stable cell-surface CRT expression were generated in order to investigate how CRT, as an isolated variable (i.e., without the requirement for chemotherapy or radiation exposure), affects anti-leukemia immunity. In a systemic disease model known to induce a potent T-cell tolerant state, 16 CRT expression on AML cells was associated with prolonged survival in wild-type, but not in T-cell-deficient mice. Moreover, leukemia-specific CD8 C T-cell responses were significantly augmented in mice harboring CRT-expressing AML, indicating that T cells were required to mediate the CRT effect on anti-leukemia immunity. CD8a C DCs were also necessary for the \"CRT effect,\" which suggested that CRT acts upstream of adaptive immunity. A modest increase in engulfment of CRT-expressing AML cells by DCs was observed, but did not appear to explain its potent effect on immunity. Rather, CRT-induced expression of type I interferon (IFN) in leukemia-bearing mice, and host type I IFN signaling, was required for the effect of CRT on AML survival. In conclusion, CRT functions as a \"danger signal\" to promote innate immune sensing of cancer through type I IFN.",

            "text": "To investigate how CRT, as an isolated variable, regulates antitumor immune responses, its cell surface expression was engineered on C1498 and C1498.SIY AML cells through a GPI anchor (Fig. 1A). GPI-mediated protein anchoring to the plasma membrane is sensitive to enzymatic cleavage by phospholipase C. 17 Treatment of CRT-expressing C1498 cells with phospholipase C resulted in significantly decreased cell surface CRT ( Fig. S1A and B), clearly demonstrating its GPI-dependent anchoring to the plasma membrane. Cell surface CRT expression on engineered C1498 AML cells was only slightly higher than that on control C1498 cells undergoing doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (Fig. S1C). Thus, we have generated an AML cell line that expresses cell surface CRT at a similar level to that observed following treatment with a chemotherapy agent known to induce CRT translocation. 2 CRT is a member of a multi-protein peptide-loading complex (PLC), which is involved in MHC class I folding and peptide loading. 4 Thus, engineered CRT expression could conceivably affect the MHC class I presentation pathway in C1498 cells. However, equivalent cell surface K b levels were observed on CRT-expressing and control C1498 cells (Fig. 1B). Also, SIY-specific CD8 C 2C T cells proliferated similarly when cultured with C1498.SIY or C1498.SIY.CRT cells, indicating that MHC class I presentation of the SIY peptide antigen was not influenced by induced CRT expression ( Fig. 1C). Last, the in vitro growth of C1498 and C1498.CRT cells was identical, demonstrating that engineered CRT expression did not affect AML cell viability or proliferation (Fig. 1D).",

Control C1498 tumors progressed rapidly in C57BL/6 mice. However, following SC C1498.CRT inoculation, 70% of mice remained tumor-free ( Fig. 2A). Conversely, both control and C1498.CRT tumors progressed similarly in Rag2 \u00a1/\u00a1 hosts (Fig. 2B), which indicated that the adaptive immune system was necessary to prevent localized growth of CRT-expressing C1498 tumors. Further, wild-type mice that rejected a SC C1498.CRT challenge were resistant to re-challenge with parental C1498 cells, suggesting that CRT expression on AML cells was sufficient to promote immunological memory against native leukemia antigens (Fig. 2C). This result also indicates that CRT itself is not a direct antigenic target of adaptive immune cells in mice harboring CRT-expressing tumors. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CRT expression on cancer cells negatively impacts localized tumor progression through a mechanism which requires adaptive immunity.",

As shown in Fig. 2D, survival of mice harboring disseminated C1498.CRT AML was significantly prolonged compared to those with control C1498 leukemia. The effect on survival was much more striking when CRT-expressing C1498.SIY cells were introduced IV, where 90% of mice survived long-term ( Fig. 2E), and were consistently able to reject a secondary C1498.SIY cell challenge (Fig. 2F). Thus, CRT expression on AML cells is sufficient to generate effective immunological memory responses, even in a disease setting associated with a profound T-cell tolerant state.",

First, the phenotypes of DCs from leukemia-bearing mice were analyzed. Surprisingly, expression of co-stimulatory B7 and MHC class I and II molecules was identical among CD11c C DCs that engulfed CRT-expressing or control C1498 AML cells in vivo (Fig. 5A). IL-12 production by CD8a C CD11c C cells that had acquired AML cells in vivo was higher than those that had not ( Fig. 5B and C), suggesting either that phagocytosis of AML cells induced IL-12 production by DCs, or that a subpopulation of IL-12-producing DCs was more efficient at AML cell uptake. Regardless, there was no difference between the frequencies of IL-12-producing CD8a C CD11c C cells that had acquired C1498 versus C1498. CRT cells in vivo (Fig. 5B and C). Furthermore, purified CD8a C DCs from C1498.SIY or C1498.SIY.CRT-bearing animals equivalently induced the proliferation of 2C T cells directly ex vivo (Fig. 5D and E), demonstrating that CRT expression on AML cells did not appear to enhance cross-presentation of leukemia cell-derived antigens by DCs to T cells. Taken together, these results indicate, at least at the time points chosen for analysis, that CRT does not appear to activate classical pathways associated with DC maturation.",

            "text": "Type I IFNs are essential for bridging innate and adaptive immune responses against solid tumors. 19,20 However, we recently observed that disseminated AML fails to induce a host type I IFN response, 15 which may help to explain the dense Tcell tolerant state that exists in leukemia-bearing hosts. To determine whether CRT expression on AML cells would induce type I IFN transcription, levels of ifnb mRNA were measured in spleen cells from mice challenged with C1498.CRT or control C1498 AML. Interestingly, a 2-fold increase in ifnb mRNA expression was detected in spleens of mice as early as 24 h following IV challenge with C1498.CRT cells (Fig. 6A). Experiments were performed to identify the specific cell type(s) in which ifnb mRNA expression was induced in the spleen following exposure to CRT-expressing AML cells. Here, CD11b C cells, but not CD11c C or CD11b \u00a1 CD11c \u00a1 cells, were found to express increased ifnb mRNA following an IV C1498.CRT cell versus control C1498 cell challenge (data not shown). To test whether enhanced ifnb expression in mice harboring C1498. CRT AML cells correlated with improved outcome, wild-type and Ifnar \u00a1/\u00a1 mice (defective in type I IFN signaling) were challenged with C1498.SIY or C1498.SIY.CRT cells, and survival was assessed. As previously demonstrated, 15 the survival of wild-type and Ifnar \u00a1/\u00a1 mice with control C1498.SIY cells was similar (Fig. 6B). Nearly all wild-type mice challenged with C1498.SIY.CRT cells survived long-term, as expected (Fig. 6B). Strikingly, the enhanced survival associated with CRT-expressing AML cells was nearly completely abrogated in Ifnar \u00a1/\u00a1 mice (Fig. 6B). Collectively, these results reveal that CRTexpressing AML cells stimulate a type I IFN response in vivo, and that type I IFN signaling in host cells is essential for the CRT-mediated effect on survival. Thus, the type I IFN pathway is an important mechanism through which CRT promotes anti-leukemia immunity.",

This model relies on the theory that tumor antigen cross-presentation by DCs is a limiting factor in generating functional antitumor T-cell responses. However, the activation status of DCs is also critical in their ability to either prime or tolerize antigen-specific T cells. For example, targeting antigen for cross-presentation by DCs leads to deletional T-cell tolerance, unless an activating signal is also provided. 8 Thus, in addition to promoting engulfment of cancer cells, we hypothesized that CRT might also directly activate DCs, licensing them to stimulate superior antitumor T-cell responses.",

On the surface, these results seemed to argue against a hypothesis supporting direct activation of antigen-presenting cells by CRT, until it was observed that splenocytes (and CD11b C cells specifically) from mice with CRT-expressing AML expressed significantly higher levels of ifnb mRNA, which is interesting in lieu of our recent finding that disseminated AML fails to induce a host type I IFN response. 15 A clear role for type I IFN in mediating the CRT effect was demonstrated in an experiment in which CRT-expressing or control AML cells were inoculated into wild-type or Ifnar \u00a1/\u00a1 mice. As previously demonstrated, 15 host type I IFN signaling played no role in regulating survival of mice with control AML. Strikingly, however, the survival benefit associated with CRT expression on AML cells was almost completely abolished in Ifnar \u00a1/\u00a1 hosts. Together, these observations support a model in which CRT stimulates a host type I IFN response that may act through CD8a C DCs to promote their ability to cross-prime leukemia-specific CD8 C T-cell responses. Although speculative, our result demonstrating that the CRT effect on survival was completely eliminated in Batf3 \u00a1/\u00a1 mice strongly supports the conclusion that this DC subset is the target of type I IFN in vivo. Others have shown that type I IFN produced in solid tumor-bearing hosts acts directly on CD8a C DCs, licensing them to prime antitumor CD8 C T-cell responses. 19 Immunotherapeutic approaches aimed at enhancing CRT translocation with chemotherapeutic agents or radiation have been difficult to develop because these modalities can concomitantly induce apoptosis of the immune cells necessary to mediate the CRT effect in vivo. However, the observation that CRT stimulates type I IFN suggests that activating this pathway, for example, with stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists, 15,24 may be an efficacious alternative immunotherapeutic strategy. Regardless, the identification of type I IFN as a mechanism through which CRT translocation stimulates host antitumor immunity represents an important step forward in our understanding of how cancers are sensed by the host immune system.",
