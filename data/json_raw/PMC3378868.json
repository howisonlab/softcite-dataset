            "text": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c (PPARc) is a key transcription factor in mammalian adipogenesis. Genome-wide approaches have identified thousands of PPARc binding sites in mouse adipocytes and PPARc upregulates hundreds of protein-coding genes during adipogenesis. However, no microRNA (miRNA) genes have been identified as primary PPARc-targets. By integration of four separate datasets of genomewide PPARc binding sites in 3T3-L1 adipocytes we identified 98 miRNA clusters with PPARc binding within 50 kb from miRNA transcription start sites. Nineteen mature miRNAs were upregulated !2-fold during adipogenesis and for six of these miRNA loci the PPARc binding sites were confirmed by at least three datasets. The upregulation of five miRNA genes miR-103-1 (host gene Pank3), miR-148b (Copz1), miR-182/96/183, miR-205 and miR-378 (Ppargc1b) followed that of Pparg. The PPARcdependence of four of these miRNA loci was demonstrated by PPARc knock-down and the loci of miR-103-1 (Pank3), miR-205 and miR-378 (Ppargc1b) were also responsive to the PPARc ligand rosiglitazone. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis validated in silico predicted PPARc binding sites at all three loci and H3K27 acetylation was analyzed to confirm the activity of these enhancers. In conclusion, we identified 22 putative PPARc target miRNA genes, showed the PPARc dependence of four of these genes and demonstrated three as direct PPARc target genes in mouse adipogenesis.",

            "text": "The need for understanding of the mechanisms controlling the differentiation of fibroblast-like pre-adipocytes to lipid-loaded adipocytes is due to the worldwide epidemic of obesity of high medical relevance (1). Adipogenesis is regulated by a network of transcription factors. The most prominent transcription factor in adipocytes is the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg) (2). During mouse adipogenesis the number of genomic binding sites for PPARg increases from a few to thousands (3)(4)(5)(6)(7) implicating that PPARg regulates hundreds of genes during adipogenesis. Therefore, the synthetic PPARg ligand rosiglitazone (RGZ) has been used in many countries in the therapy of type 2 diabetes mainly acting via its effects on gene regulation in adipocytes (8).",

Direct DNA binding of PPARg takes place as a heterodimeric complex with another nuclear receptor, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and PPREs are formed as a direct repeat of hexameric core binding motifs with one intervening nucleotide (DR1-type PPREs) (10,11). To promote the expression of its target genes, PPARg must overcome the transcriptionally repressive dense packaging of genomic DNA within chromatin. PPARg is also capable of repressing some of its target genes in a ligand-dependent manner either directly via recruitment of co-repressors upon agonist binding or via a mechanism called trans-repression (12,13). However, in adipocytes PPARg has been mainly linked to transcriptional activation of its target genes (3)(4)(5).",

            "text": "In addition to transcription factors and their co-factors, several new groups of small RNA molecules have been described in recent years as capable of controlling gene expression [reviewed in (14)]. One of the most important of these groups consists of small RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs), which are endogenous noncoding transcripts transcribed mainly by RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) as their own primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) or together with their host genes [reviewed in (15)]. The miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA) is cropped from the primary transcript by a complex known as Microprocessor that consists of two proteins, namely DROSHA and DGCR8. This pre-miRNA hairpin is then further processed into the mature miRNA duplex by an RNase III enzyme DICER. The mature miRNAs can identify their target mRNAs by base pairing to the partially complementary regions within the target mRNAs (16). miRNAs function by serving as guides to the proteins of the Argonaute family and other associated proteins, which together induce inhibition of translation as well as degradation of the targeted mRNAs (17,18). Currently, there are more than 700 known mature miRNAs in mouse (miRBase v18.0) and most of them can potentially target hundreds of mRNAs (19,20). In this way they show very comparable functions to transcription factors. Thus miRNAs can remarkably influence the transcriptomes of most eukaryotic cells. Still, fairly little is known about the transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes. Until recently, the progress was hampered by limited knowledge about the structure of miRNA genes, especially the location of their TSSs (21,22). Many miRNAs are transcribed together as clusters of several mature miRNAs. Considering this feature and the fact that each of these miRNAs can have a potential to regulate a vast number of target mRNAs, the transcriptional control of these miRNA genes needs to be both accurate and robust. And importantly, miRNAs have been shown to play key roles in the development and differentiation of most tissues and cell types (23). Also the formation of white adipose tissue in vivo and the differentiation of the mouse pre-adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 depend on expression of miRNAs (24,25). Moreover, some miRNAs, such as miR-103, are regulators of adipogenesis in mouse (26).",

However, none of these are miRNA genes. Therefore, in this study we integrated four of the above mentioned datasets of genome-wide PPARg binding sites and mouse miRNA TSS annotations (3)(4)(5)(6)21) and identified 98 miRNA clusters with PPARg binding within 50 kb from miRNA gene TSSs. Nineteen of these miRNAs (corresponding to 22 miRNA genes) are upregulated during adipogenesis and are putative PPARg targets. Further filtering resulted in the five miRNA genes miR-103-1 (host gene Pank3), miR-148b (Copz1), miR-182/96/183, miR-205 and miR-378 (Ppargc1b) that followed the upregulation of the Pparg gene during mouse adipogenesis. The transcription of all except miR-148b (Copz1) depends on PPARg in adipocytes and the loci of miR-103-1, miR-205 and miR-378 were also responsive to RGZ. Finally, ChIP assays validated three in silico predicted PPREs at the miR-103-1 locus, two at the miR-378 locus, and one at the miR-205 locus. In conclusion, we have identified a number of PPARg-regulated miRNA genes in mouse adipogenesis, which will serve the future integration of miRNAs to the core regulatory network of adipocyte differentiation and further characterize the extensive role of PPARg during this process.",

(21), namely NCBI36/ mm8. Accordingly, the coordinates of the PPARg-bound sites from Nielsen et al. (4) and Lefterova et al. (6) were lifted over from mm9 to mm8 using the UCSC lift-over tool, while the coordinates from the datasets of Lefterova et al. 3and Hamza et al. (5) were already based on mm8. For all datasets we used only published pre-analyzed data and the provided coordinates for PPARg-bound sites were used. First, miRNA gene TSSs within 50 kb of a PPARg binding site (Supplementary Table S1A-D) were identified. This was followed by checking whether an identified PPARg binding site overlaps with an in silico predicted PPRE (10) ( Supplementary Table S2A-D). A third step detects, whether an identified PPARg binding site co-localizes with a CEBPa (CCAAT/ enhancer binding protein) binding site. As input data for the last step, PPARg-and CEBPa-bound sites provided by Lefterova et al. (3) were used and a threshold of 1 kb was applied to define a co-localized region. Further details can be provided upon request.",

The considered binding sites were selected according to the analysis in the original publications (3-6). The total number of PPARg-bound sites in the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes varied for each dataset from approximately 2600 to almost 7000. We screened each of the four datasets for miRNA genes that had at least one PPARg-bound site within \u00b150 kb from their TSS ( Supplementary Table S1). Under these criteria for each dataset between 22 and 70 miRNA clusters (corresponding to 31-113 miRNA precursors) were identified. Combining the information from all four datasets resulted in 98 different miRNA clusters (corresponding to 149 individual miRNA precursors and 140 different mature miRNAs, Table 1). Within these 98 genomic loci 61 miRNA genes had at least one of their observed PPARg-bound sites overlapping with a putative PPRE identified in silico by RESearch algorithm (10) (summarized in Table 1, details are in Supplementary  Table S2). This suggests that in majority of the loci the PPARg enrichment corresponds to direct DNA binding.",

Applying a 2-fold cut-off, a similar number of miRNAs were up-and downregulated (26 and 19, respectively) during 9 days of adipogenesis. Comparing these miRNA lists with the combined list of 140 mature miRNAs (Table 1) showed that a total of 19 different mature miRNAs associated with PPARg binding in at least one of the datasets were also upregulated above 2-fold during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis ( Figure 1A). Nine different miRNAs showed similar extent of downregulation. Interestingly, the miRNA genes with PPARg-bound sites were significantly enriched for upregulated miRNAs (calculated using hypergeometric probability, P = 1.03 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 ). This enrichment of upregulated miRNAs fits well with the role of PPARg as a transcriptional activator of its target genes (3)(4)(5) and implies that many of these miRNAs could be real targets of PPARg-mediated regulation.",

In addition, many of these putative PPARg target miRNA genes give rise to more than one mature miRNA. This opens the possibility that also the other miRNAs that are transcribed from these clusters are regulated by PPARg, although they did not change above 2-fold in the array analysis. In order to more stringently identify the true targets of PPARg among the putative target miRNAs, we analyzed how many of all of the miRNA genes are implicated as PPARg targets in at least three of the four used genomewide binding profile datasets. The direct overlapping of the exact PPARg binding site genomic coordinates from the four different datasets rarely show direct matches, although the same antibody has been used in all four studies (data not shown). These differences are likely to be explained by the rather different methodology and varying data analysis strategies. In order to overcome this issue, we checked how many of the PPARg-associated miRNAs ( Supplementary Table S1) were common between the different datasets. Ten miRNAs were located in loci bound by PPARg in all four genomic PPARg binding site datasets and another 19 in at least three of the four datasets (Supplementary Figure S2). From these 29 miRNAs, 27 were mature miRNAs with different sequences and could be distinguished in miRNA microarray analysis. Overlapping the list of these mature miRNAs with the miRNAs downregulated in adipocytes yielded only one mature miRNA ( Figure 1B). However, five mature miRNAs miR-103, miR-148b, miR-183, miR-205 and miR-378, originating from six separate miRNAs genes, were upregulated above 2-fold in adipocytes. These constitute the high confidence PPARg target miRNA genes in mouse adipocytes and are referred to as the candidate PPARg target miRNAs from here on.",

None of these host genes have so far been described as primary PPARg targets. miR-183 and miR-205 are transcribed from intergenic regions, most likely as independent miRNA genes. In addition, miR-183 is part of a cluster of three mature miRNAs and is transcribed together with the two other members of the cluster, miR-182 and miR-96. Due to the very short sequence of the mature miRNAs, the arrays used to measure miRNA expression profiles are often prone to false positive results. In order to validate the upregulation and to analyze the expression dynamics of the six candidate PPARg target miRNAs as well as their host genes, we profiled their expression and compared them with the positive control genes Pparg, Cebpa and Angptl4 during mouse adipogenesis. To do this we took every 24 h RNA samples from the 8-day differentiation process of 3T3-L1 cells and determined by qPCR the relative expression of the transcripts of interest (Figure 2A). For each miRNA we measured the levels of the mature miRNA as well as the pri-miRNA. While the exact fold changes between independent differentiation experiments vary, the overall expression profiles of individual transcripts were generally reproducible ( Figure 2B-G). This was confirmed by ANOVA analysis for significant changes during the time course, which confirmed the changes for all tested mRNAs and most of the microRNAs as statistically significant (Figure 2).",

These enzymes are important for co-enzyme A synthesis and thereby for lipid metabolism (29). The level of mature miR-103 continuously increased through the differentiation starting from D2 to >5-fold on D8 ( Figure 2C). Consistent with previous reports, the Pank2 gene showed no or only weak upregulation during adipogenesis when compared with the level of Pank3 mRNA that robustly increased with an expression profile similar to that of the known PPARg target gene Cebpa ( Figure 2C) (26). This indicates that the observed increase in miR-103 is mainly due to increased production of miR-103-1 from the Pank3 gene locus. This observation is further supported by the fact that pri-miR-103-1 is clearly induced during adipogenesis while pri-miR-103-2 remained non-induced in most experiments. Interestingly, the upregulation of the mature miR-103 showed a delay in relation to its host gene Pank3. This might reflect the different processing and stability of the miRNA compared with the mRNA as well as the fact that transcription at the Pank3 locus has to triple in order to lead to doubling in the mature miR-103 production due to very similar basal expression levels of the two miR-103 loci (data not shown, see also 'Discussion' section).",

The extent of the induction can be explained by the very low basal expression of miR-205 in pre-adipocytes (data not shown). Similarly to the mature miRNA, also pri-miR-205 was upregulated during the time course, although with lower fold change. This argues that increased transcriptional activity at the miR-205 locus is contributing to the robust observed induction of the mature miRNA, while specific regulation of the miRNA biogenesis pathway might also play a role.",

            "text": "In general, the pri-miRNAs showed quite different dynamics from their respective mature miRNAs, and especially for miR-205, these inductions were clearly weaker. These differences may be explained by the relatively low stability of the transient pri-miRNA transcripts that are processed into pre-miRNAs co-transcriptionally (32,33). To address this possibility in more detail we specifically inhibited RNA Pol II-mediated transcriptional elongation in D6 adipocytes by treating the cells with DRB for a time course of 12, 24 and 48 h (Supplementary Figure S3A). As expected, all tested mRNAs had decreased by around 50% or more already after 12 h and remained at lowered levels throughout the treatment (Supplementary Figure S3B-G). Cebpa and Pparg were the least stable mRNAs with only 5-20% of the transcripts remaining after DRB treatment when compared with cells similarly treated with the DMSO vehicle (Supplementary Figure S3B). Similarly to mRNAs, the pri-miRNA transcripts were all reduced up to 10-fold after 12 h of transcription inhibition and for all except pri-miR-103-2 remained below the control levels ( Supplementary Figure S3B-G). Curiously, all pri-miRNA transcripts exhibited some increase in their levels towards the end of the treatment. This might to be explained by decreased processing of the primary transcripts upon prolonged inhibition of RNA Pol II. In contrast to the unstable pri-miRNA transcripts, most of Ppargc1b, pri-miR-378 and miR-378.

Therefore, we tested treatments of differentiating 3T3-L1 cells at D2, D4 and D6 with the PPARg agonist RGZ and observed highest upregulation of the known primary PPARg target genes Cebpa and Angptl4 at D2 ( Figure 4A and B and data not shown). This is an obvious time point for RGZ treatment, since on D2 the levels of PPARg expression have already increased but the cells have not yet been exposed to RGZ or high levels of endogenous ligands. To test the RGZ response of the candidate genes we performed a time series of RGZ treatments and collected RNA 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after the treatment ( Figure 4A). In agreement with around 24-h delay in the upregulation of mature miRNAs observed during the differentiation time course (Figure 2), the mature miR-378 was not induced until after 12 h of RGZ treatment and the more stable miR-103 became induced only after 48 h ( Figures 4C-G). In contrast miR-205 was significantly induced already 4 h after RGZ treatment, reached almost 3-fold induction by 8 h and continued to accumulate up to 10-fold by 48 h (Figure 4F). Consistently, also pri-miR-205 showed a clear response to the agonist treatment, although with a weaker fold change. Likewise, pri-miR-103-1 and pri-miR-378 were both significantly induced upon PPARg activation and continued to accumulate throughout the time course ( Figure 4C and G), while inductions of pri-miR-148b and pri-miR-96 as well as their mature counterparts were either very weak or not significant ( Figure 4D and E). Similarly to the pri-miRNAs, the host genes of miR-103-1 and miR-378, Pank3 and Pparg1b, were also significantly upregulated already after first time points of RGZ treatment, arguing that these genes are indeed primary PPARg targets.",

To address this possibility, we took advantage of the recent identification of acetylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27ac) as a histone modification specifically marking active enhancer regions (36,37). Analysis of the published ChIP-Seq data from Mikkelsen et al. 7for the level of H3K27ac at our loci of interest during 3T3-L1 differentiation confirmed that all of our tested REs, except RE3 Pank3 , are accumulating H3K27 acetylation during adipogenesis ( Figure 5, top panel).

We selected the mouse 3T3-L1 cells as a cellular model, for which far more public data are available than for any comparable human system (3)(4)(5)(6)26).

The integration of the four datasets suggested that for 140 miRNAs a PPARg-bound site is located within 50-kb distance from their TSS in at least one of the datasets. Since PPARg is significantly upregulated during adipogenesis, a filtering of the 140 miRNAs for those that are more than 2-fold upregulated during 3T3-L1 differentiation, reduced the number to 19 miRNAs encoded by 22 miRNA genes that form the list of putative PPARg targets. However, the condition that PPARg binding at the genomic region had to be confirmed in at least three of the four datasets, reduced the list to six miRNA genes miR-103-1, miR-103-2, miR-148b, miR-183/96/182, miR-205 and miR-378. Both a detailed time course analysis of the upregulation of these miRNAs as well as PPARg silencing in differentiated adipocytes excluded only miR-103-2 and miR-148b from this list of putative primary PPARg target genes. Still, PPARg might influence also the transcription of miR-103-2 and miR-148b loci, although not as potently as for the other tested loci, or for example in a different cellular context. Importantly, the genes encoding miR-103-1, miR-205 and miR-378 could be confirmed as classical PPARg targets also by RGZ treatments. Interestingly, the host genes of these miRNAs, Pank3 and Ppargc1b, are also primary PPARg target genes, which have not yet been reported as such. For Pank3 (miR-103-1) we validated three genomic PPARg binding sites that overlap with in silico predicted PPREs 19, 31 and 37 kb upstream from the Pank3 TSS, for the Ppargc1b (miR-378) locus two PPARg locations with adjacent PPREs 90 and 38kb upstream of the TSS, and for the miR-205 locus one PPARg binding site with PPRE at 118-kb upstream of the TSS. The future work to identify the exact PPRE sequences responsible for target gene regulation, especially for REs containing multiple PPREs, will require detailed experiments applying reporter gene assays or optimally zinc-finger nuclease-mediated targeting of individual endogenous PPREs. However, by applying the genome-wide mapping of H3K27ac, a histone modification specifically marking the active enhancer regions, we have already shown that most of the validated PPARg-bound sites are accumulating increased levels of H3K27ac, suggesting that these enhancers are actively contributing to the regulation of the identified target genes.",

            "text": "Although most of our candidate miRNA genes depend on PPARg for their expression in adipocytes, we found that the dynamics of their expression changes, and those of their host genes, varied during adipogenesis. This is perhaps most evident for miR-103, which exhibits a delay in its upregulation when compared with the host gene Pank3. While this observation might be mainly explained by different processing of the two mature transcripts, the usage of alternative TSSs or differential stability of the two mature transcripts could also play a role. Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an epigenetic modification known to mark active TSSs. Based on genome-wide mapping of H3K4me3 in mouse 3T3-L1 cells, only one TSS exists at the Pank3 locus during adipogenesis (7). This argues that the differences observed in the expression dynamics are more likely to be explained by the dissimilar stabilities of the mature transcripts, rather than alternative TSS usage. Indeed, consistently with our observations (Supplementary Figure S3), miRNAs were recently estimated to possess an average half-life of almost 5 days (35). This is 12 times longer than the median half-life of mRNAs, which is 10 h (38). When a mature transcript exhibits a low turnover, it accumulates higher basal expression levels, even upon low levels of basal transcription. Consequently, upon increased expression such transcript can exhibit relatively low fold inductions with slower accumulation rate although the extent of transcriptional output is comparable with that of a lower stability transcript. Therefore, it is likely that the different dynamics of miR-103 (and other miRNAs) are explained by its higher stability compared with the mature Pank3 mRNA (Supplementary Figure S3). Consistently, we found that 48 h knock-down of PPARg had no significant effects on mature miR-103 and its response to treatments with RGZ occurred only after 48 h, while the host gene Pank3 clearly responded already after 4 h.",

Indeed, miR-103 has already been described as highly induced in primary mouse adipocytes and as capable of accelerating adipogenesis (26). miR-103 belongs to a family of three miRNAs, miR-103-1, miR-103-2 and miR-107, that have almost identical sequences and are transcribed together with their host genes Pank3, Pank2 and Pank1, respectively (22,29). Interestingly, in addition to the two miR-103 loci also miR-107 was identified as a putative PPARg target gene in our initial analysis ( Figure 1A) and its host gene Pank1 has been described as a primary PPARa target in human liver (39). Importantly, recent data from Trajkovski et al. (40) demonstrated that silencing of miR-103 and miR-107 in the adipose tissue of mice leads to reduced fat levels, but in contradiction to previous in vitro data, not via inhibition of adipogenesis. Instead, lowered levels of the miRNAs increased the insulin sensitivity of the adipocytes, a phenomenon linked to increased number of smaller sized adipocytes. Therefore, our data, together with abovementioned findings, create direct links between PPARs, miR-103/107 family miRNAs and insulin sensitivity.",

However, based on the very robust induction that we observed during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, the members of this cluster are likely to contribute to the biology of mature adipocytes. Treatment with insulin alone was recently shown to downregulate miR-183 levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (41). However, during adipogenesis the cluster becomes upregulated in a PPARg-dependent manner, despite the presence of insulin in the differentiation medium. Therefore, it is probable that the expression of the miR-183/96/182 cluster is under combinatorial regulation of several transcription factors and pathways that together lead to the clusters increased expression in adipocytes.",

However, the list of predicted target mRNAs for miR-205 includes, for example, Runx2 (TargetScan 5.2), a transcript encoding a transcription factor with an important role in favoring osteoblastogenesis over adipogenesis during mesenchymal stem cell differentiation (42). High levels of PPARg are known to suppress RUNX2 protein expression and induction of miR-205 might serve as a mechanism to achieve this suppression. Indeed, Zhang et al. (43) recently showed that miR-205 can attenuate RUNX2 protein accumulation together with nine other miRNAs in mouse osteoblasts. However, our preliminary experiments have so far failed to demonstrate reduction in Runx2 mRNA levels upon miR-205 overexpression in pre-adipocytes (data not shown), suggesting that a combinatorial function of multiple miRNAs might be required for robust regulation of Runx2 at the mRNA level. Consistently, we were so far unable to demonstrate any significant impact of miR-205 overexpression on early adipogenesis in general, as measured by the expression levels of the known adipocyte marker genes such as Pparg and Cebpa (data not shown). Proteomeor transcriptome-wide analysis upon gain-or loss-offunction of miR-205 would be needed to reveal the primary targets mRNAs and pathways regulated by the robust induction of miR-205 during adipogenesis.",

Moreover, Ppargc1b is a known transcriptional co-activator responsible for inducing the target genes of numerous transcription factors (for example, sterol response element binding proteins, liver X receptors and PPARs) that are involved in regulation of lipogenesis and related processes (31). This suggests that PPARg may induce both miR-378 and Ppargc1b, in order to allow both to function synergistically in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Importantly, this induction is not limited to mouse 3T3-L1 cells as miR-378 was recently identified as the most highly upregulated miRNA during the differentiation of both mouse and human primary adipocytes (26,45).",

Data points indicate the mean expression values of four independent experiments and the error bars represent SEM. One sample t-test was performed to determine the significance of downregulation upon siPparg transfection (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; for Cebpa, Pank3, pri-miR-96, miR-96 and miR-205 the P-values of downregulation were 0.096, 0.078, 0.097, 0.139 and 0.052, respectively).looking at all four genome-wide datasets. To identify the PPARg-bound sites that could correspond to direct DNA binding of PPARg to a PPRE, we aligned the ChIPidentified binding sites with PPREs predicted by the REsearch algorithm(10). Predictions by REsearch are based on PPARg binding in gel shift analysis and, in addition to the PPRE location, provide information about the strength of the PPARg-PPRE interaction",
