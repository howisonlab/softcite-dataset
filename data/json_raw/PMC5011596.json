It should help create efficient personnel and organization management by exploring the impact of the work environment and work-related stress on turnover intention and analyzing the correlation between them. [Subjects and Methods] A survey was conducted with 236 physical therapists working at medical institutions in the Daejeon and Chungcheong areas. For the analysis on the collected data, correlational and linear regression analyses were conducted using the SPSS 18.0 program and Cronbach's alpha coefficient. [Results] The results showed a statistically significant positive correlation between turnover intention and work-related stress but a statistically significant negative correlation respectively between turnover intention and work environment. Work-related stress (\u03b2=0.415) had a significant positive impact on turnover intention and work environment (\u03b2=\u22120.387) had a significant negative impact on turnover intention. [Conclusion] To increase satisfaction level with the profession as well as the workplace for physical therapists, improvement of the work environment was the most necessary primary improvement.",

The WE measurement tool was reconstructed for this study based on the survey tool reconstructed by Lim 21) . WE was measured with a questionnaire of 26 questions. Each question on the measurement tool was based on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (strongly agree) points and higher scores meant better WE. Cronbach's alpha values in a previous and the present study were more than 0.700. SPSS 18.0 was used for the collected data and the analysis method is as follows. Participants' general characteristics were shown as frequency and percentage. TI, WS, and WE of the participants were obtained as means and standard deviations. The data were analyzed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient to verify the reliability of questionnaire internal consistencies. The correlation between TI, WS, and WE used correlation analysis through Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis to determine the impact of WS and WE on TI 2) .

This is similar to the results of Lim 21) and Jeong's 26) studies in which WS had the most significant impact on TI. Therefore, WS becomes the direct cause of turnovers and if not solved, leads to turnovers. Thus, it is essential to reduce the WS of physical therapists and improve the WE; ways to reduce turnovers should be sought through this.",

Further, the correlations between various stress factors and WE affecting TI could not be clearly identified because survey questions were not segmented. In conclusion, future research including national physical therapists, all medical institutions, and participants of various ages needs to be conducted. The root cause can be found and solved when correlations of each factor are identified more clearly through the segmentation of the survey questions.  ",
