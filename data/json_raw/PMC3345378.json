Most systematic reviews have finite life spans, with a median survival (time from publication until availability of new information that potentially changes the effect size or direction) of 5.5 years; it has been estimated that, for 23% of systematic reviews, new information is available within 2 years of publication. 1 Despite the need to keep reviews current, only 17.7% of systematic reviews seem to be cited as updated versions of previously published reviews. 1,2 Given its open, transparent nature and the availability of free software for online collaboration, the Internet presents a unique opportunity to explore new ways to update and publish academic research. Wikis, in particular, are efficient tools for co-creating, maintaining and making widely available repositories of knowledge. In general, a wiki allows anyone to easily add to, edit or delete the content of a website. The wiki application keeps track of all changes and offers the ability to acknowledge author contributions. It has been suggested that some of the benefits of using a wiki for collaborative authoring include the ability to track authorship, monitor the development of an article, reduce conflicts of interest and update it swiftly, thus providing a current evidence resource. [3][4][5] Wikis are used very successfully as highly efficient tools to co-create and maintain large amounts of general-interest content. A case in point is Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia in the world. With over 3.5 million pages of articles in English alone, each of which is edited 19 times on average, and over 13 million registered users, 6 this free resource overtook all other encyclopedias in size 7 and possibly even the Encyclopedia Britannica in quality, in less than 5 years. 8 Wikipedia, which contains over 20 000 health-related articles, has become a popular health resource for the general public and the medical community. 5,9 The top 200 medical articles on Wikipedia receive, on average, over 100 000 page views per month, 10 and studies suggest that 50% to 70% of practising physicians use Wikipedia as a resource when providing care. 5,11,12 Although Wikipedia is by far the largest and most popular collaboratively authored reference website, there are now over 70 health-related wikis in existence of varying specialties and depth. 13 Some serve as a general medical reference (e.g. Ganfyd.org) or subspecialty resource (e.g. Wikisurgery.org) for health professionals, while others are intended as a shared knowledge base for people with specific health concerns or conditions (e.g.",

Although the wiki attracted 875 visitors from around the globe, fewer than 1% contributed content to the article and none of the contributions substantially improved the nature or extent of evidence presented in the article. However, this initiative succeeded in stimulating dialogue about novel formats of academic publishing, as evidenced by the commentary that accumulated in the blogosphere. It also provided a lesson in what does not work, and in doing so has alerted us to important contextual factors that may hinder the role of crowd-sourcing through wikis as a means to keep science up to date.",

The average ratio of posters-to-readers in mailing lists and message boards has been estimated at 100:1. 21 The main reasons for not actively participating in these online communities include not needing to post, or feeling as though one has nothing to contribute; needing to find out more about the group before participating; thinking that they were being helpful by not posting; not understanding how the software operates; and not liking the dynamics of the community. 22 In the case of Wikipedia, there has been debate concerning whether its success is due to \"the power of the few or the wisdom of the crowd.\" 23,24 Research suggests that a small proportion of editors account for most of the work done and valued added. [24][25][26] The levels of contributions to the wiki in the present study could not be explained by the absence of new   evidence, as there were at least 6 articles just on teledermatology published between the third week of November of 2006, [27][28][29][30][31][32] when the original search of the literature was performed, and the end of the data collection period in April 2010. It is possible that there was limited interest in the relatively narrow topic area of asynchronous telehealth; however, targeted efforts were made to increase awareness about its existence among hundreds of specialist members of the Canadian Society of Telehealth. It is more likely that the results are a function of the review methodology itself, lack of familiarity with the wiki, and the incentive structure of academic publishing. 5,33 As discussed earlier, only 17.7% of systematic reviews seem to be cited as updated versions of previously published reviews. 1,2 This low update rate could, in part, reflect the effort required to complete a systematic review. Updates are time-consuming, expensive and yield relatively little new evidence if conducted too often. 34 Although updating a scoping review typically involves less effort than a traditional systematic review given the lower level of data integration, similar logistical barriers could have discouraged users of the wiki from updating the present review.",

Recent research suggests that certain socialization tactics (e.g., welcome messages, assistance and constructive criticism) can enhance users' confidence in participating in a wiki. 37 By far the most important determinant of technology adoption is perceived usefulness. 35 Unfortunately, recent initiatives suggest a general lack of interest among scholars in Web 2.0 publishing. 33 Some journals like Open Medicine (e.g., BMJ, PLoS, Nature, Bioinformatics) have been experimenting with article commenting, which many have already considered to be a failure for not attracting enough participation. 33,38,39 According to Priem and Hemminger, 33 the lack of participation of scholars in article commenting, which we propose could be extended to all Web 2.0 scholarly activities, can be attributed to \"the three 'C's': culture, credit, and critical mass.\" There are major cultural barriers to the use of Web 2.0 tools in scholarly publishing. This kind of work is not encouraged in medical or postgraduate education, and does not count toward publications, grants or any other type of currency for career advancement. However, to achieve sustainability, Web 2.0 initiatives must establish a critical mass of contributors. 5,33 High levels of activity also lend credibility by implying that the site is popular, which in turn motivates more people to contribute content. 40 Heilman and colleagues 5 have provided a number of suggestions that could facilitate the adoption of wikis by building a culture of open, collaborative authoring in science and medicine. These include: requiring students to critically appraise and improve articles on Wikipedia as part of their medical or postgraduate education curricula; encouraging participation in WikiProject Medicine (a community of Wikipedia editors interested in improving the quality of health-related articles), which is applying for credit as a continuing medical education (CME) opportunity; and the coupling of traditional publishing with contributions to Wikipedia as demonstrated by the scientific journal RNA Biology. 41 ",

Several online platforms are currently testing tools and strategies to recognize authorship (e.g., WikiGenes, MedPedia, Google Knol). 3 One relevant example is OPI-MEC (www.opimec.org/), an observatory of innovative practices in complex, chronic disease management, which produced the first collaboratively authored book on poly-pathology using online crowd-sourcing efforts. As a platform designed purposefully to bring together like-minded individuals, OPIMEC met all of Heilman's Cs: it already had a strong culture of collaboration, a critical mass of scholars knowledgable in the topic area, and tools and processes for the identification and recognition of contributions (e.g., lead authors produced the first version of each chapter, integrated contributions from the community and credited community members as co-authors on the basis of the extent of their contributions). 42 There is also growing interest in new ways to measure scientific impact. 33 As discussed in detail by Priem and Hemminger, \"these days scholars not only cite previous work in journal publications, they may add it to their personal web pages, bookmark, tweet, or blog about it.\" 33 Building one's online research identity may soon become a necessity for researchers. Evaluators could use Web usage tracking tools to mine and evaluate these social media-based metrics of scholarly impact.",

By changing the study in this manner and by incorporating strategies to recognize contributions, it might be possible to establish whether wikis could in fact be valuable resources for keeping research evidence up to date.
