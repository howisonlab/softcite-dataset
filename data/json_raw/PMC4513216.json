We therefore investigated the extent to which prescriptions reflect the actual use of medication during pregnancy, and whether medicines used during pregnancy are taken according to the prescribed dosage and duration. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study in a population-based congenital anomaly register (EUROCAT Northern Netherlands). We included 202 women who had at least one prescription during their pregnancy and who gave birth between 2009 and 2011. Compliance with the prescribed medication was verified by telephone interview. We calculated the compliance rates for several medication groups by dividing the number of mothers who confirmed they had taken the medication by the total number to whom it had been prescribed. Compliance was positive if the mother confirmed she took the medication, even if she only took one of several prescriptions from the same medication group. For each prescription taken, we also determined whether her use conformed to the prescribed dosage and duration. Results During the first trimester, the compliance rates ranged from 0.84 (for chronic diseases) to 0.92 (for pregnancy-related symptoms). Most of the medications actually taken were used at the prescribed dosage or lower. More than half of the medications actually taken were used for the duration prescribed or shorter. Conclusion Prescription records are generally a relatively reliable source of data for research into associations between medication use in pregnancy and congenital anomalies compared with other data sources. Pharmacy records of medication use in pregnancy might represent an",

However, whether new medicines have any teratogenic effects is largely unknown, since data obtained from animal studies cannot always be translated to humans, and pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials for ethical reasons [2]. For chronic illnesses, the use of medication during pregnancy is often unavoidable. The use of some specific medications might result in a higher risk of specific congenital anomalies, such as the anti-epileptic medication valproic acid, which results in an increased risk of spina bifida if used in the first trimester of pregnancy [3]. Given that certain medications are unavoidable during pregnancy and the severity of some congenital anomalies, research into associations between them is highly relevant.",

However, one cannot assume the patient actually takes the medication prescribed [4]. Non-compliance can result in misclassification of exposure and lead to bias in study outcomes [5,6].

The study found that interviews were preferable to pharmacy records in the case of OTC medicines used. However, pharmacy records were found to provide more reliable information for longer recall periods and where mothers used multiple and/or repeated medicines [18]. In a Danish study, researchers compared data in the North Jutland Prescription Database (NJPD) with data from interviews in the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) and calculated the compliance rates. In this study, the researchers defined compliance as the probability of mothers reporting the use of medicines in the DNBC after a prescription had been dispensed, so in fact the mothers' recall was investigated. The study reported a 'compliance' of 70-100 % for medicines for chronic use and of 12-59 % for medicines for short-term use [5]. In another study, in the EUROCAT NNL, the maternal recall of prescribed medication during pregnancy was investigated by comparing the results of a paper questionnaire using indicationoriented questions with the medication registered in the EUROCAT NNL database based on information from the pharmacy. The sensitivity was calculated as the proportion of women who reported prescription medication use in the questionnaire among those who had been exposed to that medication according to the registry data. A woman was recorded as having been exposed when she confirmed (in a telephone interview) that she had taken the medication prescribed or when she mentioned using OTC medicines. For medication for chronic use, a sensitivity of 0.47 (95 % CI 0.40-0.55) was found, i.e., the use of medicines for chronic use was reported in the questionnaire by 47 % of the mothers who had received a prescription for a medication for chronic use. For medication for occasional or short-term use, and for pregnancy-related symptoms, the sensitivity was 0.34 (0.29-0.40) and 0.51 (0.43-0.58), respectively [19].",

However, for medicines for short-term use, the compliance in our study was higher, although the Danish study investigated the recall [5]. Compared with the results from the EUROCAT NNL study, which investigated maternal recall, the reported compliance in our study is higher for all groups [19]. This can be explained by the self-reporting based on interviews and questionnaires, like the Danish and EUROCAT NNL studies, being affected by several aspects influencing accurate recall [20,21], such as language barriers, time pressure, or the woman's circumstances, like perception, expectation, experience, and education [22][23][24]. One would therefore expect to see under-reporting of medication use in pregnancy when using interviews or questionnaires without the support of pharmacy records [19,25].",

Although the dosage of a medication and duration of exposure are considered relevant factors in affecting pregnancy outcomes [26], the quality of these parameters in studies using routinely collected administrative data has not been thoroughly examined [27]. Nevertheless, it is important to look at specific medicines or groups of medicines to investigate whether the dosage or duration changes during pregnancy. For example, one study showed that 39 % of women who used anti-asthmatics during pregnancy actually discontinued or reduced their medicines [28].",

Although the women were sent a list of their prescribed medication before the interview, the question still arises as to how accurately they can recall the actual use of a prescribed medication retrospectively. The period between date of telephone interview and date of birth ranged from 2 to 35 months. The compliance rate did not differ significantly among the 'short time' and the 'long time' group; however, regardless of time between the telephone interview and the date of birth, correct recall of the use of a certain medication (particular, that for short-term use) may be difficult. It is possible that women give positive answers to please the interviewer or deny the use of a medication if they feel guilty about their child's condition.",
