In this study, we investigated the relationship between RDW and end-organ damage in hypertensive patients. Material and methods: The 446 systo-diastolic hypertensive patients included in the study received 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Left ventricular mass index, glomerular filtration rate, and microalbuminuria were measured to identify end-organ damage. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels of all patients were also examined. Results: The mean age of the participants was 49.96 \u00b111.04 years. The mean RDW was 13.06 \u00b11.05%. Red cell distribution width was positively correlated with left ventricular myocardial index (LVMI), urinary albumin, hs-CRP, and NT-proBNP (r = 0.298, p < 0.001; r = 0.228, p < 0.001; r = 0.337, p < 0.001; r = 0.277, p < 0.001, respectively), while RDW was negatively correlated with eGFR (r =-0.153, p < 0.001). Additionally, while there was a positive correlation between RDW and 24-h systolic blood pressure, no correlation was found between RDW and 24-h diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.132, p = 0.006 and r = 0.017, p = 0.725, respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that RDW levels were independently associated with eGFR, LVMI, and severity of albuminuria (\u03b2 = 0.126, p = 0.010; \u03b2 =-0.149, p = 0.002; \u03b2 = 0.114, p = 0.035). Conclusions: High RDW levels in systo-diastolic hypertensive patients were found to be an independent predictor of end-organ damage."

In particular, hypertensive patients with end-organ damage are associated with increased cardiovascular events [1,2], while end-organ damage development in hypertensive patients is reported to be associated with increased inflammation and neurohumoral activation [3][4][5]. Increases in inflammation and neurohumoral activation cause increased red cell distribution width (RDW), and increased RDW levels that reflect size heterogeneity of the erythrocytes in the circulation are also reported to be associated with heart failure, coronary artery disease, and increased mortality in the general population [6][7][8][9].",

            "text": "End-organ damage development in hypertensive patients is a significant indicator of cardiovascular risk. Diagnosis of kidney damage associated with hypertension is made by the detection of symptoms of declining kidney function or increased urinary albuminuria [14]. We demonstrated that increased RDW levels were independent predictors of decreased eGFR values, although the creatinine values were within the normal range. Our results are in agreement with those of Lippi et al., who also reported that a low eGFR was a predictor of high RDW values [15]. In another study, a strong association between decreased renal function and high RDW levels was attributed to impaired erythrocyte maturation in chronic kidney disease patients due to increased inflammation [16].",

            "text": "Another finding that demonstrates impaired renal function in hypertensive patients is the degree of microalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients who are undergoing treatment [1,17]. Microalbuminuria is not only a predictor of subclinical renal damage but is also a predictor of generalized endothelial dysfunction and increased inflammation [3,18].     A study conducted on grade 1 hypertensive patients reported an association between increased RDW and endothelial dysfunction [19], and a population-based study by Afonso et al. found an association between an increase in RDW and proteinuria development; this was attributed to inflammation, neurohumoral activation, and endothelial dysfunction [20]. In our study, we also found that increased RDW levels were independent predictors of microalbuminuria. Left ventricular hypertrophy, like microalbuminuria, has also been demonstrated to be a predictor of poor cardiovascular prognosis [2,21]. In our study we demonstrated that high RDW levels were an independent predictor of LVMI. Since increased neurohumoral activation and inflammation are associated with increased LVMI in hypertensive patients [5,22], these factors may be responsible for the association between LVMI and RDW. Kilicaslan et al. recently demonstrated that RDW values were associated with ventricular geometrical patterns [23] in untreated hypertensive patients.",

In patients with coronary artery disease, Fukuta et al. reported high RDW values associated with increased BNP values, but no association was detected with hs-CRP levels [27]. Fukuta et al. proposed that the association between RDW and adverse clinical incidents in the studied patient population was related to neurohumoral activation rather than inflammation. The renin-angiotensin system, inflammation, and oxidative stress are hyperactive in hypertension [28,29], and increases in these factors have been associated with increased end-organ damage and increased RDW levels [5,30,31].",
