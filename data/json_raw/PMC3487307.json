While angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (collectively AIABs) have a role in left ventricular (LV) disease, the impact of AIABs on right ventricular (RV) function is unknown. AIAB use was determined by medication inventory during the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis baseline examination. RV measures were obtained via cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The relationship between AIAB use and RV measures was assessed using multivariable linear regression, stratified by race/ethnicity, and adjusted for multiple covariates. AIAB use was associated with lower RV mass (-0.7 g, 95% confidence interval [CI]-1.3 to-0.1, P=0.03) in African Americans (N=1012) after adjustment for multiple covariates including LV mass. Among Caucasians (N=1591), AIAB use was associated with larger RV end-diastolic volume (3.7 mL, 95% CI 0.7-6.8, P=0.02) after adjustment for LV volume. No significant associations were seen between AIAB use and other RV measures or in Hispanic or Chinese American participants. AIAB use was associated with RV morphology in a race-specific and LV-independent manner, suggesting the renin-angiotensin system may play a unique role in RV structure and function. The use of AIABs in those with RV dysfunction warrants further study.",

            "text": "The role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been well described in left ventricular (LV) structure and function, but its contribution to right ventricle (RV) performance is less well known. The pulmonary capillary bed is a major site of angiotensin I and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) production. [1] Angiotensin II causes proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. [2] ACE2 is a counter-regulatory homolog of ACE that is located in the pulmonary endothelium and leads to vasodilatation and antiproliferation. [3,4] Increased RAS activity has been demonstrated in various animal models of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Interventions targeting RAS prevent RV morphologic changes in the setting of pulmonary vascular disease. [5][6][7] For example, ACE2 augmentation prevents or reverses PH and subsequent increases in RV mass in monocrotaline animal models. [5,6] Increased pulmonary endothelial ACE activity has been documented in the explanted lungs of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients, and ACE2 expression increases in failing RVs of cardiac transplant recipients. [8,9] Manipulation of RAS pathways (via ACE inhibition or angiotensin II receptor blockade) could impact pulmonary vascular function and/or RV remodeling. The use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs; collectively AIABs) in the treatment of pulmonary vascular disease and RV dysfunction is not supported by the small amount of available data, however. [10][11][12] We examined the relationship of AIAB use with RV structure and function assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large cohort of participants without clinical cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that AIAB use would be associated with higher RV ejection fraction (RVEF) and larger RV stroke volume (RVSV), lower RV mass, and smaller RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV), and RV end-systolic volume (RVESV). Preliminary results from this study have been published in the abstract form. [13] MAtERIAlS ANd MEthodS",

Exclusion criteria included clinical cardiovascular disease, weight > 300 lbs, pregnancy, or impediment to long-term participation. The presence of clinical cardiovascular disease was determined at participant screening by questionnaire. Participants were excluded if they answered \"yes\" to having been diagnosed by a physician with heart attack, stroke, transient ischemic attack, heart failure, angina, current atrial fibrillation, and/or to having undergone any prior cardiovascular procedure. Hypertension and diabetes were not exclusion criteria. The protocols of MESA and studies described herein were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all collaborating institutions and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. The MESA-Right Ventricle Study is an ancillary study that planned for the selection of 4,634 participants with interpretable cardiac MRIs at the baseline examination for measurement of RV morphology, which was completed in 4204.

[15,16] Briefly, RV image analysis was performed by two independent analysts on Windows workstations using QMASS software (v4.2, Medis, The Netherlands). The endocardial and epicardial borders of the RV were traced manually on short-axis cine images at end-diastole and end-systole. Papillary muscles and trabeculae were included in the RV volumes and excluded from RV mass. [17] RVEDV and RVESV were calculated using Simpson's rule by summation of areas on each slice multiplied by the sum of slice thickness and image gap. RV mass was determined at end-diastole as the difference between end-diastolic epicardial and endocardial volumes multiplied by the specific gravity of the heart (1.05 g/cm 3 ). [15] RVSV was calculated by subtracting RVESV from RVEDV. RVEF was calculated by dividing RVSV by RVEDV. The intra-reader intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) from random, blinded re-reads of 229 scans for RV mass was 0.94 and for 230 scans was 0.99, 0.95, and 0.89 for RVEDV, RVESV, and RVEF, respectively. The intra-reader ICC was 0.96 for RVSV. The inter-reader ICCs from random, blinded re-reads of 240 scans for RV mass, RVEDV, RVESV, and RVEF were 0.89, 0.96, 0.94, and 0.80, respectively.

Models were further adjusted for hypertension and use of antihypertensive medications, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, urine albumin, smoking (status and pack years), diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, cholesterol, triglycerides, statin use, level of education, and respective LV parameters (e.g., the model for RVEF was adjusted for LV ejection fraction, and so forth). We assessed for collinearity of the main exposure (AIAB use) with the other blood pressure and treatment variables.

[22][23][24][25] In a single study of four patients with PAH, captopril improved radionuclide measured RVEF, but it is difficult to know whether this improvement was driven by systemic afterload reduction and concomitantly increased LV ejection fraction. [22] The impact of AIABs on RV morphology has been studied in patients with systemic RVs from congenital heart disease with mixed results. [26][27][28] In the largest randomized trial (N = 17), Therrien and colleagues demonstrated that ramipril had no impact on RVEF, mass, or volumes in adults with moderate systemic RV dysfunction. [27] Our study is the first to suggest that AIABs may have a role in RV modeling in the absence of clinical pulmonary or systemic vascular disease and ventricular dysfunction. While the effect sizes are modest, AIAB therapy leads to comparable effects in the LV after two years. [29] In severe PAH, long-term intravenous epoprostenol decreases RVEDV by on average 8 mL but leads to significant improvements in exercise capacity, functional status, and survival. [30,31] Similarly, it has been shown that a 10 mL change in RVSV during follow-up is a clinically relevant change for patients with pulmonary vascular disease.

            "text": "It is surprising that AIABs may have an association with lower RV mass in African Americans but not in Caucasians. African Americans have greater LV mass and more LV hypertrophy as compared to Caucasians among healthy individuals and those with systemic hypertension. [33][34][35][36] While electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy has been shown to regress over time in both whites and non-whites treated with ARB-based therapy, African Americans  are more likely to have persistent echocardiographic LV remodeling/hypertrophy despite antihypertensive therapy, and these changes predict future cardiovascular events. [37,38] Moreover, African Americans with heart failure treated with ACE inhibitors have a greater risk of clinical progression, worsening LV dysfunction, and death as compared to Caucasians. [20,39,40] It has been suggested that these race-specific differences may be due to innate differences in neurohumoral activation, blood pressure response, and/or genetic variation. African Americans may have greater nitric oxide deficits and endothelial damage than Caucasians (and therefore may be less likely to respond to RAS manipulation). [40,41] In the RV, we have shown that African Americans have lower RV mass and less RV hypertrophy when compared to Caucasians after adjustment for LV mass, suggesting an RV-specific relationship. PAH therapy (such as endothelin-receptor antagonists) appears to be less efficacious in African Americans than in whites, possibly due to disparate effects on the RV. [42] Taken together, these observations suggest that AIAB therapy may (1) distinctly impact the RV as compared to the LV, and (2) that these relationships not only vary by race-ethnicity but are unlike those observed in the LV, perhaps due to differential adaptation to pressure loading and alterations in the genetic signature. [43] Genetic variation in the ACE gene results in altered levels of cardiac ACE activity and the insertion/deletion polymorphism (ACE I/D) has been associated with LV hypertrophy, LV dysfunction, and mortality in heart failure. [44][45][46] While homozygotes for the deletion allele (ACE DD) are at increased risk for PAH, the ACE DD genotype appears to protect against RV dysfunction and preserve cardiac output. [47,48] Genotype frequency is known to vary by race/ethnicity, with the ACE DD genotype more commonly occurring in African Americans than the ACE I/D or ACE insertion/insertion genotypes. [49] It is possible that ACE gene interactions may explain the race/ethnicity differences seen here and that AIAB therapy may have pleiotropic effects on the pulmonary vasculature and the RV.",

In the LV, moderate post-infarct dilatation has been proposed to be compensatory and may preserve stroke volume, yet large end-systolic volumes predict poor outcomes in high-risk patients. [29,50] In patients with systemic hypertension, lower LV stroke volume during antihypertensive treatment has been shown to predict cardiovascular risk, independent of LV morphology. [51] AIAB therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease has been shown to reduce LV mass and volumes, while exercise-induced increases in LV mass in trained athletes and in RV mass in MESA participants are believed to be adaptive. [29,37,38,52] Our study has several limitations. No conclusions can be drawn about causality since this study was cross-sectional in nature. While we adjusted for multiple covariates, unmeasured or residual confounding is still possible, specifically confounding by indication. However, if present, we would expect such confounding effects of AIABs on both the RV and LV, so that adjustment for LV measures should eliminate the RV findings. This was not the case, as the associations between AIABs and RV morphology persisted despite LV adjustment, making confounding by indication less likely to explain our results. The duration of treatment with AIABs was not assessed. Some participants could have been treated for years with these medications, and others for only a short period of time. However, such misclassification would likely bias to the null (e.g., a participant treated for a few months before the baseline study visit would be unlikely to have any effects on RV morphology, yet would still be classified as an AIAB user). Therefore, it is possible that we have underestimated the associations between AIAB use and RV morphology. Finally, stratifying by race/ethnicity created smaller sample sizes in the Hispanic and Chinese American groups, likely limiting our power to detect associations.",
