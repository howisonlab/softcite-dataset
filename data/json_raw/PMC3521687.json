            "text": "Tau is a neuronal protein that stabilizes the microtubule (MT) network, but it also forms filaments associated with Alzheimer's disease. Understanding Tau-MT and Tau-Tau interactions would help to establish Tau function in health and disease. For many years, literature reports on Tau-MT binding behavior and affinity have remained surprisingly contradictory (e.g., 10-fold variation in Tau-MT affinity). Tau-Tau interactions have also been investigated, but whether MTs might affect Tau filament formation is unknown. We have addressed these issues through binding assays and microscopy. We assessed Tau-MT interactions via cosedimentation and found that the measured affinity of Tau varies greatly, depending on the experimental design and the protein concentrations used. To investigate this dependence, we used fluorescence microscopy to examine Tau-MT binding. Strikingly, we found that Taxolstabilized MTs promote Tau filament formation without characterized Tau-filament inducers. We propose that these novel Tau filaments account for the incongruence in Tau-MT affinity measurements. Moreover, electron microscopy reveals that these filaments appear similar to the heparin-induced Alzheimer's model. These observations suggest that the MT-induced Tau filaments provide a new model for Alzheimer's studies and that MTs might play a role in the formation of Alzheimer's-associated neurofibrillary tangles.",

            "text": "Tau protein is expressed in neurons and functions to stabilize microtubules (MTs; Makrides et al., 2004;Choi et al., 2009). MTs are dynamic polymers, able to grow and shrink, and these dynamics are regulated by a group of MT-associated proteins, including Tau (Desai and Mitchison, 1997;Amos, 2000;Askham and Morrison, 2002;Howard and Hyman, 2003). In neurons, MTs are linearly and densely packed along the length of the axon, inducing a global cellular polarity critical for neuronal signaling (Tanaka and Kirschner, 1991;Slaughter et al., 1997;Witte et al., 2008). In normal cells, Tau is found distributed throughout axons and is localized to MTs. The interaction of Tau with MTs is regulated through many mechanisms, including alternative splicing (there are six known human Tau isoforms) and phosphorylation (Alonso et al., 2010;Fauquant et al., 2011). However, in Alzheimer's disease, Tau becomes aggregated to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and it is no longer associated with the MT network (Goedert et al., 1999;Sun and Gamblin, 2009). The Tau in these tangles is quite different from that in normal cells, in that it is hyperphosphorylated and has a different ratio of expressed isoforms. It is also structurally altered: normal Tau is soluble with very little secondary structure, but Tau molecules in NFTs bind together to form straight, ribbon-like filaments or paired helical filaments with beta-sheet content (Mizushima et al., 2007;Jeganathan et al., 2008).",

            "text": "As yet, it is not clear whether the formation of NFTs is a cause or effect of Alzheimer's, but the correlation between Tau-rich NFTs and Alzheimer's has made Tau a target of much research. One focus has been on studying interactions between MTs and Tau, with the goal of establishing the normal physiological function of the protein. This work has shown that Tau promotes MT binding behavior determined according to approach TcMv, with total MT concentrations ranging from 0 to 8 \u03bcM (see Materials and Methods). When the data were fitted (solid line) using nonlinear regression according to the standard binding equation (Eq. 1; see Appendix), a K D of 0.11 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM was obtained. (C) Tau-MT binding behavior determined according to approach TvMc, with total Tau concentrations ranging from 0 to 26 \u03bcM. The dotted line shows a theoretical curve plotted according to Eq. 2 using the K D value calculated in (B); the data are clearly inconsistent with this curve. The solid line shows a fit of the data to Eq. 3, which includes an additional linear term meant to account for Tau-Tau interactions on the MTs (see the Appendix). According to this fit, K D = 2.02 \u00b1 1.03 \u03bcM and \u03c1 = 6.88 \u00b1 0.37 \u03bcM. The red arrow indicates the point at which supersaturation (greater than 1:1 binding) begins to occur, and the red data points show the sedimentation behavior of moderate (4 \u03bcM) and high (20 \u03bcM) concentrations of Tau in the absence of MTs. (D) Approach TcMv at 2 \u03bcM (orange) and 4 \u03bcM (blue) Tau, with total MT concentrations ranging from 0 to 8 \u03bcM. When these data were fitted to the standard binding equation (Eq. 1), K D values of 1.39 \u00b1 0.35 \u03bcM and 0.67 \u00b1 0.16 \u03bcM for 2 and 4 \u03bcM Tau, respectively, were obtained. The gray data and curve are reproduced from (B) and are provided for comparison. The variability in the data at higher [Tau] is discussed in the Appendix. (E) Approach TvMc at 0.5 \u03bcM (green) and 0.1 \u03bcM (red) MT, with total Tau concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 \u03bcM. When these data were fitted to Eq. 3 (see Appendix), the following values were obtained: for 0.5 \u03bcM MT, K D = 0.84 \u00b1 0.41 \u03bcM and \u03c1 = 3.53 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcM, while for 0.1 \u03bcM MT, K D = 0.10 \u00b1 0.32 \u03bcM and \u03c1 = 1.06 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcM. The gray data and curve are reproduced from (C) and are provided for comparison. Data in all panels are the average of \u22653 trials \u00b1 SD. stability and reduces MT dynamics (Panda et al., 1995;Al-Bassam et al., 2002;Bunker et al., 2004). The MT-binding and MT-stabilizing activities of Tau are contained within the C-terminal domain, which contains four MT-binding repeat motifs sandwiched by proline-rich regions ( Figure 1A). The N-terminus of Tau (also called the projection domain) is believed to space apart MTs within the crowded axon by bridging with the Tau N-termini projecting from neighboring MTs (Hirokawa et al., 1988;Kempf et al., 1996). While there is general agreement about these aspects of Tau-MT interactions, the literature contains conflicting information about others. As previously noted by Ackmann and colleagues, the reported values for the Tau-MT affinity vary by more than an order of magnitude, from less than 100 nM to more than 1 \u03bcM (Goode and Feinstein, 1994;Ackmann et al., 2000;Makrides et al., 2004). Research has shown that different isoforms have different affinities, but wide ranges of affinities have been reported, even for the same isoform (Goode and Feinstein, 1994;Sillen et al., 2007;Fauquant et al., 2011), and the origin of these discrepancies remains unresolved.",

Because the Tau in Alzheimer's NFTs is highly phosphorylated and does not bind to MTs (Paudel and Li, 1999;Alonso et al., 2010), in vitro studies of NFT formation have generally utilized systems devoid of MTs. These studies have concluded that unmodified Tau can form filaments similar to Alzheimer's NFTs in vitro, but that the process requires a lot of time (days) and the presence of promoters, such as heparin, arachidonic acid, or polyglutamates (Friedhoff et al., 1998;Barghorn and Mandelkow, 2002;Hiraoka et al., 2004;Jeganathan et al., 2008). Some previous studies have shown that Tau-Tau oligomerization can occur in the presence of MTs and even that Tau-Tau oligomerization is promoted FIGURE 1: The apparent Tau-MT affinity depends on the methods and protein concentrations used. (A) Schematic diagram of the domains of the full-length Tau used in this study (441 amino acids, not drawn to scale). The C-terminus contains four MT-binding repeat motifs (R1-R4) surrounded by proline-rich regions (P). (B) Tau-MT by MTs (Ackmann et al., 2000;Makrides et al., 2003). On the basis of these observations, researchers have concluded that Tau can bind to the subset of Tau molecules that are bound to MTs (Ackmann et al., 2000;Makrides et al., 2003;Sillen et al., 2007). However, while there is clear evidence that MTs promote Tau oligomerization on the surface of MTs, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated whether Tau filament formation might be influenced by the presence of MTs.",

We decided to investigate the possibility that differences in experimental approach could explain (at least partially) the discrepancies in the values of the reported dissociation constant. MT-binding studies are typically performed using cosedimentation assays in which the [Tau] is held constant and the [polymerized tubulin] is varied, or alternatively where [polymerized tubulin] is held constant and [Tau] is varied. In either case, the amount of Tau that cosediments with the MTs is interpreted as Tau that is bound to MTs. By performing experiments in which we used both experimental designs in parallel, we found that the apparent affinity of Tau for MTs depends both on the approach used to study the interaction and on the concentration of each binding partner. We found that this dependence is observed when the data are fitted using both standard binding models or binding models designed to account for Tau-Tau oligomerization at the MT surface, suggesting that an interaction not accounted for by these models is occurring in these reactions.",

Surprisingly, we found that MTs induce the rapid formation of Tau-only filaments. This observation is important for two reasons. First, the existence of these filaments confounds attempts to measure Tau-MT interactions by any method, because they deplete the pool of free Tau available to bind to MTs, and they spin down in cosedimentation assays. More significantly, these filaments form in regular MT-binding buffers, are induced by MTs, and are seen by electron microscopy (EM) to be similar to the wellestablished Alzheimer's-like Tau filaments induced by heparin. These observations suggest that the MT-induced filaments might provide a useful new in vitro model for the formation of Tau filaments in Alzheimer's disease, and they raise the possibility that MTs play a previously unappreciated role in the formation of Alzheimer's-associated NFTs.",

In measuring dissociation constants, the researcher usually holds one protein constant, while varying the concentration of the other, and then evaluates the amount of complex formed under each condition. As noted above, binding to MTs is typically assessed by cosedimentation, in which the experimenter assumes that the reaction has reached equilibrium and that any test protein that sediments does so by binding to the MTs. In some analyses of Tau-MT binding, researchers hold Tau constant, while varying the concentration of polymerized tubulin (e.g., Goode and Feinstein, 1994). In others, polymerized tubulin is held constant, while Tau is varied (e.g., Ackmann et al., 2000). We refer to these approaches as \"Tau constant MT varied\" (TcMv) and \"Tau varied MT constant\" (TvMc), respectively (see Materials and Methods). To test whether differences between TcMv and TvMc could account for the differences in published Tau-MT affinity values, we measured Tau-MT interactions using both approaches under otherwise identical conditions.",

However, contrary to the predictions of this model, we observed that the apparent affinity of Tau for MTs also depends on the concentration of MTs ( Figure 1E).

As discussed above, it is also accepted that Tau can engage in Tau-Tau interactions on the MT surface (Ackmann et al., 2000;Kar et al., 2003;Makrides et al., 2003). We wondered whether the unusual behavior of Tau in the MT-binding assays might be caused at least in part by the formation of Tau filaments during the assays. Such an observation would be surprising, because formation of heparin-induced Tau filaments is very slow, taking days to accumulate significant concentrations of filaments, and is normally performed at much higher [Tau] than used in our experiments. However, we decided that it was worthwhile to investigate, because, as discussed above, the dependence of the apparent Tau-MT K D on the concentration of MTs was inconsistent with Ackmann's mathematical model for Tau-MT interactions. Moreover, the Tau in our TvMc assays appeared to be cosedimenting with MTs at levels beyond what could be explained solely by limited Tau oligomerization at the MT surface, as predicted using the mathematical models of MTBindingSim (Philip et al., 2012;unpublished data). These observations suggested that we should investigate the possibility that MTs induce the formation of Tau filaments.",

Furthermore, we found that the Tau-only filaments remained intact after we allowed the MTs to depolymerize by lengthy incubations in buffer without Taxol (Figure 3). This observation indicates that while the Tau filaments do require MTs to form (Figure 2), they do not require MTs to be maintained.",

First, the Tau filaments could cosediment with MTs, either by being associated with MTs or by sedimenting independently. If the Tau filaments cosediment, filament formation is expected to increase both the apparent affinity and the apparent Tau bound :tubulin ratio by increasing the fraction of Tau that sediments at a given concentration. To test the hypothesis that the Tau filaments do cosediment with MTs, we incubated fluorescently labeled 2 \u03bcM Tau and 4 \u03bcM MTs for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and performed a standard cosedimentation assay. However, this time, instead of loading the supernatant and pellet fractions on a gel, we imaged them using fluorescence microscopy. We observed that both MTs and Tau filaments sediment nearly to completion-few of either were found in the supernatant ( Figure  4). These data show that the central assumption of cosedimentation assays (the idea that Tau in the pellet is bound to MTs) is being violated under any condition in which the Tau filaments are being formed. Thus cosedimentation assays cannot be used to provide a valid measurement of Tau-MT interactions if filaments are present.",

However, we realized that no approach would be sufficient to provide a valid measurement, because the formation of Tau filaments perturbs affinity measurements in a second way as well: assembly of Tau into filaments depletes the pool of free Tau available to bind to MTs, which would decrease the apparent affinity by decreasing the effective concentration of Tau present in a given reaction. While the first problem (sedimentation of Tau filaments) is specific to cosedimentation assays, the second problem (depletion of the pool of free Tau) impacts any technique that can be used to measure Tau-MT interactions, regardless of whether sedimentation is involved.",

This observation indicates that the Cross-linking supports the existence of Tau-Tau interactions in the MT-binding assays Our first goal in testing the hypothesis that filaments might be forming in our assays was to reproduce the results of Makrides et al.

Supplemental Figure S1 provides evidence that Tau does cross-link to Tau in our assays and, as expected, does so only in the presence of MTs ( Figure S1).

Importantly, the assembly of these Tau-only dissociation constant measured in Figure 1B likely provides a reasonable estimate of the actual Tau-MT dissociation constant in agreement with previous measurements performed at low [Tau], e.g., Goode and Feinstein (1994).

To test this hypothesis, we incubated the Tau with MTs for a longer time and collected images at different time points. Working with 2 \u03bcM Tau and 4 \u03bcM MTs, we found that Tau starts out in both MT-bound and Tau filament form at 15 min, but shifts completely into Tau filament form after 1 h ( Figure 6).

Consistent with the observations of Figures 4 and 6, we saw that all of the Tau shifted to the pellet as long as MTs were present (see Figure S2), making it appear that the increased incubation time shifted the Tau-MT interaction from a low binding affinity to a high binding affinity. However, this would be an incorrect interpretation: Tau sedimentation results from a combination of fast MT binding and slower Tau polymerization. One impact of this sedimentation behavior is that the apparent affinities obtained from the experiments of Figure 1D are not legitimate measurements of the Tau-MT binding interaction. Moreover, because the kinetics of the Tau polymerization process likely vary in a complicated way with the number of nucleation sites, this time-dependent polymerization behavior also provides an explanation for the variability seen at particular MT concentrations. These issues require further study. FIGURE 4: Tau filaments spin down in ultracentrifugation. Tau (2 \u03bcM) and MTs (4 \u03bcM) were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. The mixture was ultracentrifuged, and the supernatant and pellet were separated according to MT-binding assay protocol for imaging. While the \"before spin\" and pellet images are representative, the supernatant image shows one of very few MTs left in the supernatant. These data show that cosedimentation assays are likely to yield invalid measurements of the Tau-MT affinity, because cosedimentation assumes that all Tau in the pellet is bound to MTs. Colored images display tubulin as red and Tau as green and their overlay as yellow. Scale bars: 10 \u03bcm. Images shown represent the typical results of three independent experiments.",

We first hypothesized that this process might be promoted by the glutamate-rich C-terminal tails of tubulin, since polyglutamates can induce Tau fibrillization in vitro (Friedhoff et al., 1998). To test this idea, we incubated Tau with MTs from which the \u03b1-and \u03b2-tails of the tubulin dimers had been removed by subtilisin digestion (Figures 7  and S3). Surprisingly, we found that when we used MTs stripped of their glutamate-rich tails, there was no obvious effect on formation of the Tau filaments ( Figure 7). This observation indicates that the tubulin tails are not involved in the nucleation process, but does not provide any information about what aspect of the MT structure is involved. Further work will be required to resolve this question. However, one speculation is that the filaments might be nucleated by MT tips, as suggested by fluorescence microscopy images showing Tau filaments extending from MT tips ( Figure S4). We used EM to better visualize the Tau filaments and perhaps gain insight into the nucleation mechanism, as discussed in the following section.",

            "text": "Up to now, the only in vitro experimental model for the formation of Tau NFTs seen in Alzheimer's disease has been the assembly of Tau filaments by inducers, such as heparin, arachidonic acid, and polyglutamates (e.g., Friedhoff et al., 1998;Jeganathan et al., 2008). Heparin fibrillizes full-length human Tau into a combination of twisted and flat, ribbon-like filaments. EM, thioflavin-S fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and circular dichroism studies have provided evidence that these filaments can be used as an acceptable model of the NFTs that form in Alzheimer's disease (Ramachandran and Udgaonkar, 2011;Wegmann et al., 2011). As noted earlier, this filament assembly typically occurs over a period of days or at least hours, often uses very high Tau concentrations, requires anionic inducers, and is performed in systems devoid of MTs. To investigate the relationship between our novel Tau filaments and the heparin-induced filaments used as models for NFTs, we turned to transmission electron microscopy (TEM).",

One obvious question FIGURE 5: Experiments using 1 \u03bcM Tau minimize Tau filament formation. Tau (1 or 2 \u03bcM) was incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C with 4 \u03bcM MTs, and then the solution was imaged by fluorescence microscopy. The number of MTs and Tau filaments were counted from three separate optical fields spanning a total imaged area of 35.6 square mm under each condition. The number of MTs counted exceeded 300 within each field. The fields chosen for counting were typical representations of more than 10 experiments. FIGURE 6: Formation of Tau filaments is a time-dependent process. Tau (2 \u03bcM) was incubated with 4 \u03bcM MTs periodically supplemented with Taxol at 37\u00b0C, and images were collected at 15-min, 1-h, 2-h, and 3-h time points. By 1 h, the number of Tau filaments had reached a maximum. The bar graph data were generated as described in Figure 5, counted from three separate optical fields spanning a total imaged area of 35.6 square mm. The number of MTs counted exceeded 300 within each field. The fields chosen for counting are typical representations of more than six different fields of collected data.  Figure S3). Left panels show MTs, middle panels show Tau, and the right panels show the overlay; the MTs are displayed in red, the Tau in green, and the overlay in yellow. Scale bar: 10 \u03bcm. Images shown represent the typical results of more than 30 different fields of collected data. (Jeganathan et al., 2008;Ramachandran and Udgaonkar, 2011;Wegmann et al., 2011). As shown in Figure 8A, the MTs in our experiments can be recognized as straight filaments that have clear protofilament ridges. When full-length Tau is incubated with heparin in the NFT-promoting buffer, it forms many straight and a few twisted filaments, in agreement with previous reports ( Figure 8B; Wille et al., 1992;Jeganathan et al. 2008;Wegmann et al., 2010Wegmann et al., , 2011Ramachandran and Udgaonkar, 2011). When Tau is incubated by itself in MT buffer (PEM), no filaments are visible ( Figure 8B, inset). However, when Tau and MTs are incubated together, numerous nonhelical filaments without ridges appear ( Figure 8C). These filaments appear superficially similar to the classical heparin-induced filaments (compare Figure  8, C and B). Strikingly, we were also able to observe a number of incidences in which the Tau filament appeared to be polymerizing from the MT ends ( Figure 8D), in agreement with our previous fluorescence observations ( Figure S4).",

The MT-induced Tau filaments were most similar in appearance and width to the straight heparin-induced Tau filaments (Figure 8, B, C, and F). The significance of the slight differences in width between these two types of filaments is not clear, but could be due to buffer conditions. Indeed, many EM studies observing in vitro-generated Tau filaments have shown that the filament morphologies can vary depending on the Tau construct used, the anionic inducer used, or the buffer conditions (Crowther, 1991;Goedert et al., 1992;Barghorn and Mandelkow, 2002;Jeganathan et al., 2008). Recent studies have readdressed the issue of varying Tau filament morphologies and found that the thicker regions of Tau fibrils range between \u223c9 and 18 nm, and the thinner regions range between \u223c10 and 15 nm (Wegmann et al., 2010). The observation that the width of the MT-induced Tau filaments falls within these values supports the idea that the MT-induced and heparin-induced filaments are similar structures. Given that the heparin-induced filaments are recognized as models for Alzheimer's-induced NFT filaments, the sum of these data suggest that these MT-induced Tau filaments provide a new in vitro model for Tau NFT formation.",

Tau was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (A30052; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), following Invitrogen's protocol for amine-reactive probes. The labeling ratio was generally one dye molecule to \u223c10 Tau molecules. Labeled Tau generated from multiple different Tau preps formed similar Tau filaments, and control cosedimentation experiments showed that for all preps the binding activity of 2 \u03bcM labeled Tau with 2 \u03bcM labeled MTs was similar to that of the unlabeled proteins (unpublished data). The labeled MTs and labeled Tau protein were incubated together in BRB80 buffer (80 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA) in the presence of 10 \u03bcM Taxol; samples were diluted 1:10 and supplemented with an oxygen-scavenging system (mixture containing catalase, glucose oxidase, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and glucose) just prior to imaging. Images were acquired on a Nikon inverted microscope TE2000 using a 60\u00d7/1.4 numerical aperture (NA) objective and a Cascade 512B camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Figure 4 alone was imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV inverted microscope using 63\u00d7/1.4 NA objective and a Princeton Instruments (Trenton, NJ) Micromax camera. Both microscopes were fitted with a High Q filter set from Chroma (Bellows Falls, VT). All images were assembly of these filaments is significant for two reasons. First, we propose that it accounts both for the failure of Tau-MT interactions to fit standard binding models and for the wide ranges of reported affinity values measured under different conditions (Goode and Feinstein, 1994;Sillen et al., 2007;Fauquant et al., 2011). The possibility remains that Tau also binds to MTs in a cooperative manner, as is suggested by the inconsistent nature of the decoration of MTs by Tau (Figure 2). However, it will be difficult to address this issue in a quantitative way until conditions are found that eliminate MT-induced Tau filament formation over a range of Tau concentrations. Questions such as the significance of the Tau purification method for filament formation (i.e., the classic boiling method vs. other approaches) and the mechanism of filament nucleation remain important additional avenues for future research.",

First, the observation that Tau forms the filaments rapidly in relatively gentle conditions indicates that Tau-Tau interactions do not require phosphorylation or the presence of chemical inducers. Additionally, the Tau filaments are found to form from the unlabeled protein, as shown by TEM (Figure 8). These observations suggest that Tau-Tau interactions might have a role in normal Tau function. Moreover, the similarity of the MT-induced Tau filaments to those formed in Alzheimer's disease implies that MT induction of Tau filament assembly might provide an easier way to make Tau filaments and thus open new avenues for studying and perhaps inhibiting filament formation. Finally, the induction of Tau filament assembly by MTs in vitro provides additional support for the suggestion (Friedhoff et al., 1998;Ackmann et al., 2000) that MTs might play a role in the formation of Alzheimer's-associated NFTs in vivo.",

            "text": "Discussion and analysis of the binding data in Figure 1 When the value of the dissociation constant for a protein-protein interaction is measured, one protein is typically held constant, while the other is varied, and the data are fitted to an appropriate equation to extract the dissociation constant (more about this later in the Appendix). If the binding is simple, the same answer should be obtained by holding either protein constant in the experiment-it should not matter which is held constant and which is varied. Similarly, the measured affinity should not depend on the concentration of proteins used. We refer to the approach in which Tau concentration, [Tau], is held constant and the concentration of MTs, [MT], is varied as TcMv, and the converse as TvMc. Note that throughout this article, [MT] is measured as the concentration of polymerized tubulin dimers. To test whether differences between the apparent behavior of Tau in the TcMv and TvMc approaches could account for the discrepancies in published Tau-MT affinity values, we measured Tau-MT interactions using both approaches under otherwise identical conditions. To further characterize the interaction, we then tested the dependence of the obtained values on [MT] (in TvMc) and [Tau] (in TcMv). As discussed more below, our results are not only inconsistent with the idea that Tau binds to MTs via a simple interaction, they are also inconsistent with the more sophisticated binding model developed by Ackmann et al. (2000), which attempts to incorporate Tau binding to MT-bound Tau. This inconsistency suggests that another interaction not accounted for by the Ackmann model occurs when Tau and MTs are mixed. The main text provides evidence that this \"other interaction\" is the MT-induced formation of Tau filaments.",

These include the ideas that: 1) Tau-MT binding events are independent and reversible, 2) Tau-MT binding is the only significant interaction occurring in the solution, 3) the interactions have reached equilibrium, and 4) cosedimentation of Tau with MTs reflects the binding of Tau to MTs. Our observation that the apparent affinity depends on the concentration of both Tau and MTs demonstrates that at least one of these assumptions is being violated, and, therefore, that neither Eq. 1 nor Eq. 2 can be validly applied to the Tau-MT cosedimentation data. This conclusion is consistent with that of Ackmann et al. (2000), who determined on the basis of TvMc analysis that Tau-Tau interactions are occurring on the MT and Eq. 2 is not sufficient to describe binding of Tau to MTs. To address these issues, Ackmann and colleagues modified Eq. 2 to include a term that attempts to account for the Tau-Tau interactions on the MT surface (Eq. 3). However, we find that even Ackmann's modified binding equation (Eq. 3) is insufficient to describe Tau-MT binding behavior, because the observed K D and \u03c1 values (implied by Ackmann to be constants) vary with [MT] ( Figure 1E). One explanation for these observations is that an as yet unaccounted for interaction is occurring in the Tau-MT binding assays. As discussed in the section of the article on investigations of Tau-Tau interactions, we provide evidence that this additional interaction is the MTinduced formation of Tau-only filaments.",

Indeed, such a concentration dependence would be expected from Ackmann's evidence that Tau-Tau interactions can occur at the MT surface.

            "text": "To test this possibility, we repeated the experiments of Figure  1, B and C, using the same two approaches, but with different concentrations of proteins under otherwise identical conditions. When we changed [Tau] used in the TcMv approach, we found that the apparent Tau-MT affinity also changed ( Figure 1D): while 1 \u03bcM Tau yielded an apparent affinity of 0.11 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM ( Figure  1B), 2 \u03bcM and 4 \u03bcM Tau yielded K Dapp values of 1.39 \u00b1 0.35 \u03bcM and 0.67 \u00b1 0.16 \u03bcM, respectively ( Figure 1D). The change in apparent affinity is expected from the idea that Tau binds to Tau on the MT surface (Ackmann et al., 2000), but we were puzzled by the inconsistent nature of the change: the K D value extracted from the fit rose (i.e., the apparent affinity weakened) from 1 \u03bcM to 2 \u03bcM Tau and then fell from 2 to 4 \u03bcM Tau. It is also notable that the data for the 2 and 4 \u03bcM Tau experiments are more variable than the data for the 1 \u03bcM Tau. While this variability made it difficult to fit the curves, the general trends observed in Figure 1D were consistent across many experiments ( Figure 1D and unpublished data). Possible origins of this variability are discussed more in the main text.",
