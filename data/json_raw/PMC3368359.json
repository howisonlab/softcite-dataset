            "text": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression was found to be induced in the mammalian CNS, including the retina, by different types of stress leading to cellular apoptosis. Here, we tested possible involvement of AChE in hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis in a retinal cell line. Y79 retinoblastoma cells were incubated in starvation media (1% FBS and 1 mg/ml glucose) for 16-24 h, and then exposed to hyperglycemic environment by raising extracellular glucose concentrations to a final level of 3.5 mg/ml or 6 mg/ml. Similar levels of mannitol were used as control for hyperosmolarity. Cells were harvested at different time intervals for analysis of apoptosis and AChE protein expression. Apoptosis was detected by the cleavage of Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) using western blot, and by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. AChE protein expression and activity was detected by western blot and by the Karnovsky and Roots method, respectively. Mission TM shRNA for AChE was used to inhibit AChE protein expression. Treating Y79 cells with 3.5 mg/ml of glucose, but not with 3.5 mg/ml mannitol, induced apoptosis which was confirmed by TUNEL assay and by cleavage of PARP. A part of the signaling pathway accompanying the apoptotic process involved up-regulation of the AChE-R variant and an N-extended AChE variant as verified at the mRNA and protein level. Inhibition of AChE protein expression by shRNA protected Y79 cell from entering the apoptotic pathway. Our data suggest that expression of an N-extended AChE variant, most probably an R isoform, is involved in the apoptotic pathway caused by hyperglycemia in Y79 cells."

            "text": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an essential enzyme in cholinergic synapses since it hydrolyses acetylcholine, thereby terminating cholinergic excitation. However, AChE was also found in tissues devoid of cholinergic innervations (Small et al., 1996), indicating potential non-cholinergic functions for this enzyme including response to stress (Grisaru et al., 2001) and neurogenesis (Robitzki et al., 1998;Bytyqi et al., 2004). There are three different isoforms of AChE resulting from alternative splicing of a single gene: synaptic (S), erythrocytic (E), and read-through (R) (Soreq and Seidman, 2001). Each of these three C-terminal variants can appear in one of two forms depending upon the length of its N-terminus; a normal N-terminus and an extended one. Thus, in principal AChE can appear in six different isoforms. Different AChE variants are believed to be involved in different physiological and/or pathological processes. AChE-S is the variant located in cholinergic synapses and responsible for termination of cholinergic excitation (reviewed in Meshorer and Soreq, 2006). AChE-R was found to play a role in the response to stress in laboratory animals (Kaufer et al., 1998;Shohami et al., 2000). Forced swimming (physiological stress) induced AChE-R mRNA expression in FVB/N mice (Kaufer et al., 1998). 2 -O-methyl RNA-capped antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ODN) against AChE mRNA blocked over-expression of AChE-R in head-injured mice, reducing the number of dead CA3 hippocampal neurons and facilitating neurological recovery (Shohami et al., 2000). A novel AChE variant with an extended N-terminus was found to exacerbate lightinduced photoreceptor degeneration in albino rats. Treatment with AS-ODNs significantly reduced the expression of this protein, and lowered the degree of light-induced functional damage as expressed by electroretinogram recordings (Kehat et al., 2007). AChE was found to be expressed during apoptosis in different cell types in which the apoptotic pathway could be prevented by AS-ODNs of AChE (Soreq et al., 1994;Zhang et al., 2002). It was later reported that the AChE variant involved in apoptosis was the N-extended AChE-S one (Toiber et al., 2008(Toiber et al., , 2009. There is evidence regarding the correlation between stress-activated protein kinase family and apoptosis-associated AChE expression. Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its downstream transcription factor, c-Jun, was enhanced during apoptosis induced by the DNA topoisomerase inhibitors etoposide or excisanin A, in colon cancer cell line SW620. A corresponding increase in AChE expression in the apoptotic cells was observed. This up-regulation in AChE was eliminated by administering a JNK inhibitor, silencing JNK with siRNA or antagonizing c-Jun with a dominant-negative c-Jun mutant (Deng et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Apoptosis-programmed cell death, is an active process that has well-documented biochemical and morphological characteristics, including nuclei break into several pycnotic granules as a result of DNA fragmentation and cell shrinkage (Majno and Joris, 1995). In the retina, apoptosis plays a major role in the loss of visual cells in degenerative disorders such as Retinitis Pigmentosa and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (reviewed in Wenzel et al., 2005), and also occurs in Diabetic Detinopathy (Barber et al., 1998). Biochemical, physiological, and morphological alterations have been observed in non-vascular retinal cells (Barber et al., 1998;Li et al., 2002;Mohr et al., 2002;Kusner et al., 2004;Xi et al., 2005) during early stages of diabetes in animal models, raising the possibility that hyperglycemia is detrimental to retinal neurons prior to any vascular involvement. Rats with streptozotocin-induced-diabetes exhibited reduced electroretinogram responses as early as two weeks after the onset of the diabetes. The rats also expressed glial fibrilary acidic protein (GFAP) in Muller cells before any vascular abnormality was detected in the retina, a sign of early retinal damage (Li et al., 2002). Several studies have shown that Muller cells incubated in elevated glucose concentrations undergo apoptosis as determined in part by annexin-V staining and activation of caspase 3 (Lorenzi and Gerhardinger, 2001;Mohr et al., 2002;Kusner et al., 2004;Xi et al., 2005). Our goals were to test the hypothesis that AChE is involved in hyperglycemia-induced apoptosis of retinal cell line and to identify the AChE variant included in this process.",

For TUNEL assay, cells were seeded on microscope cover glasses pre-coated with 0.1% poly-D-lysine [prepared in 100 mM Na 2 B 4 O 7 .10(H 2 O) buffer at pH 8.2], and cultured over-night in the HG-medium. After confirming attachment of cells to the cover slips, medium was changed to LG-medium for over-night starvation. Glucose was added to the starved cells at different concentrations and for different time periods, after which TUNEL was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and then washed in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate on ice, washed twice with PBS and incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 \u2022 C in a humidified atmosphere in the dark. Slides were washed twice with PBS, stained with DAPI for nuclei detection, and washed again with PBS. The cover glasses with cells were flapped on glass slides covered with a few drops of mounting media (DakoCytomation), photographed using an upright fluorescence microscope (Axioscop 2, ZEISS), and processed by the Image Pro software."

Since PARP is a nuclear protein, we decided to test its cleavage in nuclear extracts and not in whole-cell extracts to prevent dilution. Nuclear extracts were prepared and collected as described previously (Schreiber et al., 1989). Proteins were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 1 h, and subsequently probed with a primary monoclonal antibody: anti-PARP (SeroTec, UK) that detects the full length as well as the cleaved PARP. HRP-conjugated Donkey-anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., USA) was used as secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent-ECL (prepared locally) and visualized by autoradiography. AChE expression was also detected using western blot analysis. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared (Schreiber et al., 1989), and separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described above. A rabbit anti-human polyclonal AChE antibody, which detects all isoforms of AChE, was used (sc-11409, diluted 1:500 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA). A mouse monoclonal antibody anti-\u03b1-Tubulin (T6199, diluted 1:4000 from Sigma-aldrich, USA) was used for normalizing cytoplasmic protein loading. HRP-conjugated Donkey-anti-rabbit or anti mouse (1:5000 diluted in 50% glycerol, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., USA) was used as secondary antibody. Densitometry analysis was done by TotalLab Quant software.",

            "text": "The method of AChE cytochemical staining is based on the ability of AChE to hydrolyze acetylthiocholine, which contains a sulfur atom substituted for oxygen in the ester linkage. Enzymatic cleavage of acetylthiocholine by AChE yields acetate and thiocholine, whose sulphydryl group reduces ferricyanide to ferrocyanide. Brown copper ferrocyanide (Hatchett's brown), is formed at the site of enzymatic activity and immediately precipitates thus marking the site of AChE activity. The procedure for detecting AChE activity was originally described by Karnovsky and Roots (Karnovsky and Roots, 1964), and modified by Hanker et al. (Hanker et al., 1973) and Kobayashi et al. (Kobayashi et al., 1994). Briefly, cells were seeded on microscope cover glasses while cultured in the DMEM culturing medium. Upon being dried at room temperature, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and then washed in PBS. The cover glasses were then covered with 1 ml per slide of a mixture containing: 65 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0 containing 0.5 mg acetylthiocholine iodide, 5 mM sodium citrate solution, 10 mM copper sulphate solution, 0.5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 0.1 ml DDW, and 10 \u22122 mM of Iso-OMPA (Tetra-isopropyl pyrophosphoramide for inhibition of Butyrylcholinesterase) at room temperature for overnight incubation.

Thus, demonstration of PARP cleavage is accepted as a molecular indicator for the induction of an apoptotic process.

These results indicate that hyperglycemia caused by 6 mg/ml of glucose, induced apoptosis primarily as a result of hyperosmolarity, while at a lower concentration of 3.5 mg/ml of glucose, apoptosis was induced mainly as a result of hyperglycemia and to a lesser extent by hyperosmolarity.

To test this hypothesis, Reverse Transcription (RT) real-time PCR was performed. As seen in Figure 5, mRNA expression levels corresponding to the AChE-S isoform were low and did not change significantly after 15-, 30-or 60-min incubation with 3.5 mg/ml of glucose. However, mRNA expression transcripts tested for the AChE-R or the N-extended isoforms, were significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated by 1.5 \u00b1 0.15 and by 1.4 \u00b1 0.14-fold respectively, compared to control Y79 cells.",

It removes unwanted cells, which may be injured or misplaced, thus preventing the spread of pathological processes from injured cells to healthy ones. This naturally occurring cell death is prominent in neurons of CNS including the retina during development (Young, 1984;Rodier, 1995). Apoptosis also occurs in the adult CNS tissue subjected to a variety of stressful events such as pathological changes observed in both Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders in brain (Sasaki et al., 1998). In the adult retina, apoptosis is observed after subjecting it to photic stress (Hafezi et al., 1999;Grimm et al., 2001), or to metabolic stress such as hyperglycemia (Barber et al., 1998;Mohr et al., 2002;Kusner et al., 2004;Xi et al., 2005).",

Under control conditions, AChE expression ( Figure 3) and activity (Figure 4) in Y79 cells is very low, probably reflecting de-differentiation of this retinoblastoma-derived cell line. However, when Y79 cells were treated with 3.5 mg/ml glucose for an hour, AChE expression and activity (Figures 3 and 4, respectively) were significantly increased compared to control. AChE expression decreased almost back to the control level, when tested 2 h after exposure to 3.5 mg/ml glucose (Figure 3), reminiscent of an immediate early gene mRNA and protein expression (Kaufer et al., 1998). AChE expression was not increased in cells treated with 6 mg/ml glucose or in cells treated with mannitol although Y79 cells exposed to these conditions were shown to undergo apoptosis, probably as a result of hyperosmolarity (Figures 2, 3). This may indicate that AChE induction is involved in apoptosis induced by selective stress types, e.g., hyperglycemia but not FIGURE 7 | Cleavage of PARP in nuclear extracts of sh-RNA lenti-infected Y79 cells treated by adding glucose.

            "text": "by hyperosmolarity. These results shown involvement of AChEstress-induced apoptosis, agree with multiple previous reports demonstrating stress-induced expression of AChE following a variety of stress episodes to the central nervous system, e.g., forced swimming (Kaufer et al., 1998), head trauma (Shohami et al., 2000), and photic stress to the retina (Kehat et al., 2007). The findings that apoptosis and AChE were induced by hyperglycemia can reflect two unrelated pathways linked by a common trigger or can reflect a single pathway in which AChE expression leads to apoptosis. To differentiate between these possibilities we blocked AChE expression with shRNA. We found that preventing AChE expression using shRNA was accompanied by prevention of apoptosis (Figures 6 and 7), thus supporting the hypothesis that AChE is involved in the apoptosis induced by hyperglycemia in Y79 cells. Our RT-PCR studies indicated that hyperglycemia-induced the expression of an N-extended AChE variant and an AChE-R variant (Figure 5). The trivial conclusion is that hyperglycemia (3.5 mg/ml glucose) induced the expression of an N-extended AChE-R variant and of an AChE-R variant with regular N-terminus. The former is found in the membrane fraction and the latter in the cytoplasm fraction. This conclusion is contrary to recent findings suggesting that the N-extended AChE-S is the detrimental variant causing apoptosis (Toiber et al., 2008(Toiber et al., , 2009. These differences may be related to the type of stress and/or to the stressed tissue, but the common feature of the two variants, the N-extended terminus, probably includes elements that are involved in cellular apoptosis. This is supported by a previous retinal study demonstrating that photic stress induced the expression of an N-extended AChE variant that was involved in cell apoptosis, but its specific C-terminus type could not be identified at the protein level (Kehat et al., 2007). In the same study, in-situ hybridization showed up-regulation of AChE-R mRNA (Kehat et al., 2007). It should be noted that our findings cannot rule-out that hyperglycemia induced the expression of a low-level of N-extended AChE-S that was sufficient to cause apoptosis, but was not detected by the RT-PCR experiments. A potential mechanism for the role of AChE in the induction of apoptosis was suggested recently emphasizing the role of the extended N-terminus (Toiber et al., 2008(Toiber et al., , 2009. According this suggestion, the extended N-terminus protrudes into the cytoplasm, while the core domain is exposed to the extracellular compartment (Toiber et al., 2008). Several proteins, known to be involved in the apoptotic signaling cascade, i.e., GSK3, GAK (cyclin G associated kinase), JAB1/CSN5, integrin, and Fas (TNF receptor super-family, member 6), were found to interact with the extended N-terminus of AChE-S (Toiber et al., 2009), thus probably linking this AChE variant to apoptosis. It should be stressed that this hypothesis emphasizes the role of the extended N-terminus in apoptosis and not of the C-terminus. Therefore, it is possible that, depending upon the studied cells, the N-extended AChE-R or the N-extended AChE-S can equally play a role in inducing cell apoptosis. Therefore, the protein partners, mentioned above, would be very interesting to test in our in vitro system. Our in vitro findings on retinoblastoma cell line are consistent with the hypothesis that AChE expression pattern in the mammalian retina is altered by hyperglycemia in a manner affecting its roles. A previous study reported a reduction in AChE catalytic activity in the diabetic rat retina probably due to loss of the hydrophobic variant of AChE (Sanchez-Chavez and Salceda, 2001). Here we showed, in a retinoblastoma cell line, that hyperglycemia altered the expression pattern of AChE causing up-regulation of the AChE-R and the extended N-terminus AChE variants. The latter variant is the prime candidate to induce the observed cell apoptosis, reminiscent of retinal cells' apoptosis that was observed during early stages of diabetes (Barber et al., 1998), before any vascular alteration. These findings need to be expanded to identify with certainty the AChE variant involved in hyperglycemiainduced apoptosis, and to test this effect in vivo, in experimental diabetic models, before new therapeutic approaches can be suggested.",
