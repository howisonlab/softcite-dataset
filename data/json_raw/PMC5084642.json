Methods: Seven thousand eight hundred fifty-two adults with T2DM were identified from a national, Internet-based study. Mental wellbeing [SF-36v2 mental component summary (MCS)] was categorized as good (MCS ! 50), poor (40 MCS < 50), and very poor (MCS < 40). Outcomes included past 6 months of health care resource use and lost productivity (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire). Results: Respondents with very poor/poor versus good mental well-being were more likely to visit the emergency room (27%/18% vs 11%, P < 0.001) or be hospitalized (19%/ 14% vs 9%, P < 0.001). Among labor force participants, those with very poor/ poor versus good mental well-being experienced greater overall work impairment (43.7/26.0 vs 10.7, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Greater resource use and work productivity impairment associated with poorer mental well-being among patients with T2DM has cost implications.",

            "text": "T ype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, which is associated with various micro-and macrovascular complications, including retinopathy, neuropathy, kidney failure, and heart disease. T2DM is highly prevalent in the United States (U.S.), with recent estimates of 9.3% having the condition. 1 Because of its high prevalence and serious complications, T2DM has a profound impact on quality of life, health care resource use, work productivity loss, and increased risk of disability. 2 Similar to other chronic illnesses, T2DM has been shown to have a relationship with mental wellness. 3,4 In particular, T2DM's relationship with depression has been well documented. It has been demonstrated in numerous observational studies that patients with T2DM and depression are at a greater risk of poor self-care, lower adherence to anti-hyperglycemic agents, and poor glycemic control [5][6][7][8][9][10] leading to a higher risk of micro-and macrovascular events and risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 11 Patients with T2DM are also frequently affected by diabetes-related psychological distress, which may be affected by social stigma, lack of social support, or negative expectations about their diabetes. [12][13][14] Like depression, diabetesrelated psychological distress has been shown to have a negative impact on self-care, treatment adherence, and glycemic control. [15][16][17] Although the effect of depression on health outcomes, such as health care resource use and work productivity loss, among patients with T2DM has been studied extensively, 5,18 -23 these outcomes have not been studied in patients with T2DM and poor mental well-being more generally. Indeed, much of the focus of prior research has been on understanding the burden of psychiatric comorbidities among patients with T2DM, but not well-being in its own right.",

Typically, women and younger populations have a greater prevalence of anxiety and depression. 32,33 The pattern is a little bit less clear when it comes to ethnicity and well-being, as it is difficult to disentangle the relationship between socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Previous research has found a strong relationship between ethnicity/socioeconomic status and health disparities that can often be attributed to differences in health behaviors, cultural factors, and access to treatment. [34][35][36][37][38] In addition, a previous study looked at overall NHWS data and results showed that whites had higher mental well-being, measured by MCS scores, than ethnic minority groups, which is consistent with the results from the current study. 39 However, once demographic factors such as income were controlled for in the previous study, the differences between ethnic groups and well-being were not as clear. Given certain groups are at a greater risk for poor and very poor mental well-being, it is important to note as they may benefit from intervention.",

Even after adjusting for differences in social, health, and disease status, patients with poor and very poor mental well-being reported a greater number of health care practitioner visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations than patients with good mental well-being. Patients with very poor mental well-being also experienced the lowest work force participation. Interestingly, those with poor mental well-being experienced higher work force participation than those with good mental well-being. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics may contribute to this difference. Those with good mental well-being were older, on average, than those with poor and very poor mental well-being. Older individuals have a higher likelihood of being retired from the workforce regardless of mental well-being status. In addition, those with poor mental well-being had lower educational levels and lower annual household incomes than those with good mental well-being. Those with poor mental well-being may have to work to survive financially, necessitating greater workforce participation. Those with very poor mental well-being have the lowest annual household income levels and the lowest levels of workforce participation. Regardless of financial need, those with very poor mental wellbeing may simply be unable to work or may be eligible for disability benefits to survive financially. Those with poor and very poor mental well-being who participated in the labor force experienced greater work productivity loss including greater absenteeism and presenteeism than those with good mental well-being. Displaying the greatest burden, patients with very poor mental well-being, who participated in the workforce, experienced even greater health care resource use and more pronounced work productivity loss than patients with poor mental well-being.",

            "text": "The study corroborates previous research by demonstrating that mental health has a substantial impact on health care resource use and work productivity among T2DM patients. Although we would expect this pattern to be consistent among those with T2DM, given the substantial burden already associated with T2DM, having poor and very poor mental well-being could exacerbate the negative effects. In particular, prior studies showed that patients with T2DM and depression had greater outpatient costs as well as a greater probability of having primary care, specialty care, inpatient care, emergency room visitation, and hospitalizations than patients with T2DM and no depression. 5,23,40,41 Prior studies also showed that patients with T2DM and depression had greater odds of functional disability, 18,21,22,42 and were more likely to miss at least 7 workdays in a given year, 22 compared with patients with T2DM but no depression. It is important to note that 40.5% of those with poor and 30.9% of those with very poor mental well-being were actively participating in the labor force. It is very possible that the negative impact that mental well-being had on workplace performance may extend beyond what has been measured in this study. For instance, we are not capturing details about the circumstances of those not currently in the labor force. As T2DM is a major driver of health care and indirect costs, 2 these findings suggest that poor and very poor mental well-being among patients with T2DM is a major economic burden. The greater use of health care resources found in patients with poor and very poor mental well-being indicates greater direct costs for patients and payers, including self-insured employers. To put the cost burden into perspective, an average hospitalization in the U.S. costs $18,012. 43 Those with poor mental well-being had 0.70 hospitalizations (unadjusted) annually that equates to $12,608 in annual hospitalization costs, that is, an increase of approximately $8286 in annual costs attributable to hospitalizations per patient with very poor mental wellbeing compared with a patient with good mental well-being and an additional $3962 compared with a patient with poor mental wellbeing. Considering that nearly half of patients with T2DM can be categorized as experiencing either very poor or poor mental wellbeing, direct health care costs for resource utilization are substantial. To put the burden of lost work productivity in perspective, the median individual weekly salary in the U.S. is $768, 44 which amounts to $39,936 annually assuming 52 work-weeks a year. Given those with very poor mental well-being report roughly 10.7% absenteeism (unadjusted), the amount attributable to lost wages due to missing work is $4273 annually. Those with very poor mental well-being have $3227 greater annual costs attributable to absenteeism than those with good mental well-being and $2144 greater absenteeism costs than those with poor mental well-being. Indirect costs associated with the greater presenteeism associated with very poor and poor mental wellbeing will add to the economic burden on employers.",

            "text": "Notably, the current study finds that, while patients with T2DM who were classified as having poor mental health (MCS of 40 to 50) may not necessarily meet criteria for diagnoses of depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric conditions, they have significantly greater health care resource use and experience significantly more work impairment than those with good mental wellbeing. As patients who were classified as having poor mental wellbeing represented nearly a quarter of the sample, the findings suggest previous estimates, which focused on patients with very poor mental health status (via diagnoses of psychiatric conditions) may have underestimated the total impact of mental health impairment in patients with T2DM. 5,6,18,21-23,40 -42 Prior findings suggesting that poor mental health, and particularly diabetes-related distress, is negatively associated with self-care, treatment adherence, and glycemic control, 5,6,[8][9][10]15,16,45 further highlighting the importance of the current findings. Clinicians should take care to address the mental well-being of patients in addition to the physical aspects of T2DM in order to prevent patients from developing poor or very poor mental well-being. This is particularly notable, as prior research suggests that there is discordance between patients and their physicians, with patients rating mental health symptoms as a higher treatment priority than their physicians. 45 ",
