            "text": "The small GTPase RhoD regulates actin cytoskeleton to collapse actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, resulting in suppression of cell migration and cytokinesis. It also induces alignment of early endosomes along actin filaments and reduces their motility. We show here that a constitutively activated RhoD generated two types of actin-containing thin peripheral cellular protrusions distinct from Cdc42-induced filopodia. One was longer, almost straight, immotile, and sensitive to fixation, whereas the other was shorter, undulating, motile, and resistant to fixation. Moreover, cells expressing wild-type RhoD extended protrusions toward fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2/4/8-coated beads. Stimulation of wild-type RhoD-expressing cells with these FGFs also caused formation of cellular protrusions. Nodules moved through the RhoD-induced longer protrusions, mainly toward the cell body. Exogenously expressed FGF receptor was associated with these moving nodules containing endosome-like vesicles. These results suggest that the protrusions are responsible for intercellular communication mediated by FGF and its receptor. Accordingly, the protrusions are morphologically and functionally equivalent to cytonemes. RhoD was activated by FGF2/4/8. Knockdown of RhoD interfered with FGF-induced protrusion formation. Activated RhoD specifically bound to mDia3C and facilitated actin polymerization together with mDia3C. mDia3C was localized to the tips or stems of the protrusions. In addition, constitutively activated mDia3C formed protrusions without RhoD or FGF stimulation. Knockdown of mDia3 obstructed RhoD-induced protrusion formation. These results imply that RhoD activated by FGF signaling forms cytoneme-like protrusions through activation of mDia3C, which induces actin filament formation."

            "text": "In contrast, the mechanisms of cytoneme formation remain poorly understood. It is unclear whether any Rho family proteins, N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex, mDia proteins, other actin nucleation factors, or elongation factors (Dominguez, 2009;Campellone and Welch, 2010;Chesarone et al., 2010;Takano et al., 2010) are involved in actin filament formation giving rise to cytonemes. RhoD induces alignment of early endosomes along actin filaments and reduces their movement through activating hDia2C (corresponding to mDia3C) and Src (Murphy et al., 1996;Gasman et al., 2003). It also regulates the actin cytoskeleton to disassemble actin stress fibers and focal adhesions by antagonizing RhoA, resulting in suppression of cell migration and cytokinesis (Tsubakimoto et al., 1999). Furthermore, overexpressed, constitutively activated RhoD forms actin-containing thin cell protrusions reaching 20-30 \u03bcm in length, with some being attached to the substratum but others being motile due to a lack focal adhesion-associated proteins (Murphy et al., 1996). Fluorescently labeled transferrin is internalized through these protrusions and colocalized with RhoD.",

Cdc42(G12V)-formed filopodia were usually <10 \u03bcm in length, thicker, and straight and contained actin filament bundles (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure S1A). Some, if not all, also contained microtubules detected by staining with an anti-\u03b2-tubulin monoclonal antibody (mAb; Figure  1B). They attached to the substratum as indicated by staining with an anti-vinculin mAb detecting focal adhesions and focal complexes ( Figure 1C). RhoD(G26V)-formed protrusions also contained actin filaments and were often >10 \u03bcm long, thinner, and undulating in paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed cells ( Figures 1A and S1A). They neither contained microtubules nor had vinculin-containing focal complexes ( Figure 1, B and C), indicating that they were unattached to the substratum. This is consistent with findings by Murphy et al. (1996) and findings that activated RhoD collapses focal adhesions as well as stress fibers (Tsubakimoto et al., 1999).",

Actin filament formation is responsible for generation of these protrusions. Filopodia contain tight parallel bundles of actin filaments, whereas lamellipodia are filled with branched or cross-linked actin filaments. Filopodia serve as sensory antennae or tentacles to probe microenvironment of cells, although their roles are diverse and not fully understood. On the other hand, lamellipodia are essential for cell migration by crawling.

Wing or eye imaginal disk cells and tracheal cells extend cytonemes toward signaling center cells in the organizers, producing specific morphogen or growth factor signaling proteins, such as Decapentaplegic (Dpp)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Spitz/epidermal growth factor (EGF), and Branchless (Bnl)/fibroblast growth factor (FGF; Hsiung et al., 2005;Roy et al., 2011). Nodules or punctae containing the receptors of each morphogen/growth factor are specifically segregated in cytonemes and move through cytonemes toward the cell body. Accordingly, cytonemes are proposed to be involved in long-distance intercellular communication by directly transferring specific morphogens/growth factors with their receptors. Similar protrusions have been reported in a variety of cell types, including human neutrophils, mouse B lymphocytes, and mast cells treated in various ways (Galkina et al., 2001;Gupta and DeFranco, 2003;Fifadara et al., 2010). In addition, viral cytonemes, which extend from uninfected target cells to an infected cell by the interaction between viral envelope glycoprotein with the receptor, transmit retroviruses from infected to uninfected cells (Sherer et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The Rho family of small GTPases participate in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia by regulating actin filament formation. Cdc42 binds to activate neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) together with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) or Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing proteins. Activated N-WASP induces Arp2/3 complex-mediated, branched actin filament formation (Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007;Campellone and Welch, 2010). Cdc42 also binds and activates mDia2, which nucleates and elongates unbranched actin filaments. A current working model hypothesizes that a subset of uncapped actin filaments of the Arp2/3 complex-nucleated dendritic networks is targeted for continued actin filament elongation by mDia2 (Yang et al., 2007;Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008;Faix et al., 2009;Mellor, 2010). mDia2 also nucleates to form new unbranched actin filaments. The barbed ends of these elongating actin filaments are converged through the motor activity of myosin-X, leading to the formation of filopodia. The actin filaments are cross-linked to become stiff bundles by fascin in the shaft of filopodia. RhoQ (TC10) and RhoJ (RhoT or TCL), both of which are phylogenetically close to Cdc42, also activate N-WASP and form longer filopodial protrusions than does Cdc42 (Abe et al., 2002), although involvement of mDia proteins in actin filament formation for the protrusion formation is unclear.",

These observations and those that the protrusions contained moving nodules suggest that the protrusions participate in intercellular communication, as do cytonemes. Because cytonemes are formed in response to morphogens/ growth factors such as Dpp/BMP, Spitz/EGF, and Bnl/FGF in Drosophila (Hsiung et al., 2005;Roy et al., 2011), we examined whether RhoD-induced protrusions are extended toward FGFs. Heparin-conjugated acrylic beads soaked in FGF2, FGF4, or FGF8 were placed on dishes culturing 10T1/2 cells, which had been previously transfected with EGFP-tagged wild-type (wt) RhoD and subjected to serum starvation for 24 h. Although the cells close to the beads without FGF coating inefficiently extended protrusions, the cells near the beads coated with each FGF extended thin protrusions toward the beads by 3 h after the beads were added ( Figure 3A). In addition, protrusions extending in a forward direction to the beads were much longer than those extending in a backward direction ( Figure S2A). To determine whether FGFs diffused from the beads participate in the protrusion extension, we then added FGF2, FGF4, or FGF8 to the culture medium of EGFP-RhoD(wt)-transfected and serumstarved 10T1/2 cells. Although we tried to record a time-lapse Movie S1). The latter contained fluorescent nodules or punctae.

When we coexpressed mOrange2-tagged RhoD(G26V), C-terminally EGFP-tagged FGFR1c, and Cerulean-tagged wild-type Rab5 in 10T1/2 cells, FGFR1c and Rab5, which is localized to the early endosome membranes (Zerial and McBride, 2001), were associated with the nodules in the RhoD-formed protrusions ( Figures 2C and S1D and Movie S3). The nodules moved through the protrusions toward the cell body. Collectively these results suggest that cells extend protrusions toward FGF-sourcing cells through activation of RhoD and that the protrusions transmit FGFs via FGFRs to the cell body. At least some of these FGFs-FGFRs might be transported in association with early endosome-like vesicles. Therefore these protrusions are likely to be involved in intercellular communication and morphologically and functionally equivalent to cytonemes.",

            "text": "Because the RhoD(wt)-expressing cells extended protrusions toward FGFs, and FGF stimulation facilitated protrusion formation in the cells, we addressed whether RhoD is activated by FGFs. The 10T1/2 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged wild-type RhoD, serum-starved, and stimulated with FGFs. Activation of RhoD was analyzed by a pulldown assay with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged GTPase-binding domain (GBD) of mDia3C (see Figure 6B, discussed later in this article), which is a target protein of RhoD (Gasman et al., 2003). Any of FGF2, FGF4, and FGF8 activated RhoD within 5 min after stimulation, and the activation was sustained for >30 min (Figure 4, A and B). The peak time of RhoD activation (5-15 min) may reflect the initiation time of protrusion formation (\u223c10 min; see Figure 3C). Because FGF8 activated RhoD more strongly and formed longer protrusions at 60 min than did FGF2 and FGF8 (see Figure 3C), there might be a correlation between the strength of RhoD activation and the length of the protrusions. To determine whether RhoD is essential for FGF-induced protrusion formation, we knocked down RhoD expression by RNA interference (RNAi). Either expression of two distinct Stealth small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of RhoD in 10T1/2 cells prominently reduced the endogenous RhoD mRNA level, whereas neither significantly affected the endogenous RhoF mRNA level ( Figure 4C). Thus both these siRNAs efficiently knock down RhoD, but neither has an offtarget effect on RhoF, which is most closely related to RhoD among small GTPases. As shown above, FGF8 stimulation highly promoted image of protrusion elongation, the protrusions scarcely elongated during the observation of EGFP fluorescence (see Discussion). Thus we measured the length of thin protrusions at fixed time points after the FGF stimulation. The cells stimulated with each FGF started to extend thin and long protrusions 10 min after the stimulation, and the protrusions elongated or were maintained for at least 60 min ( Figure 3, B and C). These results imply that FGFs diffused from the beads or added to the medium are responsible for the protrusion formation. the RhoD siRNAs were expressed in the presence of FGF8 stimulation, the protrusion formation was reduced almost to levels comparable with those seen without FGF8 stimulation and exogenous RhoD(wt) expression ( Figure 4D). If an siRNA-resistant RhoD ( Figure S2B) was expressed, the cells were released from the siRNA-induced suppression of the protrusion formation and formed longer protrusions ( Figure 4D). In addition, expression of the dominant-negative RhoD(T31K) also interfered with the FGF8-induced protrusion formation ( Figure  S2C). These results indicate that endogenous RhoD is indispensable for FGF8-induced protrusion formation.",

            "text": "Because the RhoD-induced protrusions contain actin filaments, actin filament formation seems to be a prerequisite for protrusion formation. Intracellular actin filament formation necessitates factors that nucleate and elongate actin filaments (Dominguez, 2009;Campellone and Welch, 2010;Chesarone et al., 2010). N-WASP activated by Cdc42 and PIP 2 or SH3 domain-containing proteins activates the Arp2/3 complex to form filopodia (Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007;Campellone and Welch, 2010). N-WASP, in collaboration with nebulin, also nucleates unbranched actin filaments in skeletal muscle myofibrils (Takano et al., 2010). Thus we examined whether N-WASP was involved in the formation of RhoD-induced protrusions. Neither expression of wild-type N-WASP nor that of the dominant-negative N-WASP(\u0394VCA) (Oikawa et al., 2008) affected the RhoD(G26V)-induced protrusion formation in 10T1/2 cells ( Figure 5, A and B). Furthermore, the protrusion formation by the expression of RhoD(G26V) was not hindered in mouse C2C12 myoblast clones stably expressing siRNAs of N-WASP (Takano et al., 2010;Figure 5, C and D). Accordingly, N-WASP does not participate in the RhoDinduced protrusion formation, probably because it is not involved in actin filament formation in the protrusions.",

When mDia3C(\u0394DAD), a constitutively active form lacking Dia autoregulatory domain (DAD; Figure 6B; Block et al., 2008), was transfected to 10T1/2 cells, the cells formed protrusions regardless of whether RhoD(G26V) was cotransfected ( Figure 8A). These protrusions contained actin filament bundles thicker than those in the RhoD(G26V)-induced protrusions. mDia3C(\u0394DAD) was restricted to the tips of the protrusions, although mDia3C was associated with both tips and stems of the protrusions. These results suggest that regulated activation of mDia3C mediated by RhoD leads to thin actin filament bundle formation generating the thin and long protrusions but that constitutively activated mDia3C gives rise to thicker actin filament bundles.",

Accordingly, mDia3C activated by RhoD is likely to form actin filaments responsible for protrusion formation. On the other hand, mDia3C(\u0394DAD) alone promoted actin polymerization remarkably, and addition of RhoD-GTP\u03b3S no longer increased the enhancement by mDia3C(\u0394DAD) ( Figure 8B).

The longer protrusions were sensitive to physical and chemical stresses, such as washing and PFA fixation, and collapsed or fragmented. Thus both types of the protrusions might be unable to elongate under UV illumination applied to detect EGFP fluorescence. The protrusions induced by FGF stimulation in RhoD(wt)-transfected cells also hardly elongated during the observation of EGFP fluorescence. This result favors the above notion that the protrusions are sensitive to physical and chemical stresses.

            "text": "Some of the RhoD-induced longer protrusions were >60 \u03bcm in length. They were much longer and thinner than filopodia induced by Cdc42 subfamily members or RhoF. The dimensional difference between the RhoD-induced protrusions and filopodia suggest that they are generated by distinct mechanisms and exert distinct functions. Although the length of Drosophila cytonemes is variable, some cytonemes are as long as 80 \u03bcm (Hsiung et al., 2005;Roy et al., 2011). Thus the length of RhoDinduced protrusions is comparable with that of Drosophila cytonemes, despite the difference between mammalian cell culture system and in developing Drosophila tissues. Wing imaginal disk cells, eye disk cells, and tracheal cells extend cytonemes toward Dpp/BMP-, Spitz/EGF-, and Bnl/FGF-producing cells, respectively. These cytonemes segregate receptors of each morphogen/growth factor (Roy et al., 2011). The receptors move in both anterograde and retrograde directions in cytonemes (Hsiung et al., 2005). RhoD(wt)-expressing 10T1/2 cells extended thin and long protrusions toward FGF2/4/8-coated beads or in response to stimulation with each of the FGFs separately. The RhoD(G26V)-induced protrusions also contained nodules moving in both directions, and most of the nodules eventually moved toward the cell body. FGFR1c coexpressed with RhoD(G26V) was associated with the nodules and moved through the protrusions. Therefore RhoD-induced protrusions are likely to be morphologically and functionally equivalent to cytonemes. Although there is no RhoD orthologue in Drosophila, some Rho family protein, such as Rho-1 or Rac-1, which is most closely related to mammalian RhoD, might be involved in cytoneme formation in Drosophila.",

            "text": "Why is FGFR transported to the cell body through cytonemes or the RhoD-induced protrusions? Canonically, plasma membrane-associated receptor tyrosine kinases activated by their growth factor ligands transduce signals into the Ras-ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, or phospholipase C-\u03b3 (PLC\u03b3) signaling, which is associated with the plasma membrane or the cytosol (Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010). On the other hand, several growth factors and their receptor complexes, such as EGFs-EGFRs and FGFs-FGFRs, are also translocated to the nucleus (Johnson et al., 2004;Bryant and RNAi. Expression of Stealth siRNAs of mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3 in 10T1/2 cells specifically reduced mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3 protein levels, respectively, but did not have off-target effects on the other mDia isoforms ( Figure 8C). Expression of the siRNAs of mDia1 or mDia2 together with RhoD(G26V) in 10T1/2 cells did not significantly affect the RhoD-induced protrusion formation ( Figure 8D). In contrast, expression of mDia3 siRNAs reduced the length of thin protrusions ( Figure 8D). When an siRNA-resistant mDia1, mDia2, mDia3A, or mDia3B ( Figure S2E) was expressed together with each corresponding siRNA, the protrusion length was not affected (Figure 8D). By contrast, expression of an siRNA-resistant mDia3C (Figure S2E) rescued the cells from the mDia3 siRNA-induced reduction of protrusion length ( Figure 8D). Consequently, mDia3C is responsible for the RhoD-induced protrusion formation, but mDia1, mDia2, mDia3A, or mDia3B is not. We conclude that these data, taken together, indicate that activated RhoD forms the protrusions by directly binding to activate mDia3C, which induces actin polymerization in the protrusions.",

These protrusions are relatively thick and stable and resistant to fixation. In contrast, cytonemes are thinner and sensitive to fixation (Ram\u00edrez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999).

Drosophila has three FGF genes, including Bnl, whereas mouse or human has 22 FGF genes (Itoh and Ornitz, 2011). Mammalian FGF2/4/8 function in a paracrine manner and act as morphogens or growth/differentiation factors in developing embryos. Analyses of gene-knockout mice have shown that the FGFs are involved in the development of particular tissues, such as the limb (Sun et al., 2002;Beenken and Mohammadi, 2009;Itoh and Ornitz, 2011). Therefore cells in these tissues of developing embryos might also generate the cytoneme-like protrusions induced by these FGFs through the activation of RhoD.",

Although mDia1 and mDia2 were predominantly present in the Stow, 2005;Carpenter and Liao, 2009;Dunham-Ems et al., 2009). Following activation by FGF, plasma membrane-associated FGFR is internalized into early endosomal compartments, which is an essential early step in nuclear translocation of FGFR. FGF and FGFR are then released from the early endosomes to the cytosol, although it is unknown whether they are linked or separated at this time. They interact with nuclear import machinery, including importin \u03b2, in the cytosol and are translocated to the nucleus. In the nucleus, FGFs-FGFRs interact with transcription regulators, such as CREB-binding protein and ribosomal S6 kinase 1, and participate in transcription of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, or development. However, FGFs-FGFRs should be unable to induce these nuclear events when they are on cytonemes or the RhoD-induced protrusions. This seems to be the reason why FGFR (as well as EGFR) is transported to the cell body through the protrusions (Figure 9).

Two primers sets used were: cell body even when RhoD(G26V) was expressed, exogenously expressed mDia3A/B/C were concentrated in the RhoD-induced protrusions. These results may imply that mDia1 is not colocalized with RhoD in the cell body, even if it can bind to RhoD in vitro. On the other hand, although mDia3A/B have the potential to bind to RhoD, endogenous mDia3A/B might neither be associated with the protrusions nor be involved in the protrusion formation. Nevertheless, exogenously overexpressed mDia3A/B might be ectopically localized to the protrusions and displace endogenous mDia3C. The siRNA-resistant mDia3C, but not the siRNA-resistant mDia3A/B, rescued the cells from the interference with the RhoD(G26V)-induced protrusion formation by the mDia3 siRNA. These results imply that activated RhoD forms the protrusions through activating mDia3C but not mDia3A/B. Indeed, mDia3C (hDia2C) has been reported to be a specific effector of RhoD (Gasman et al., 2003). Activated RhoD binds to mDia3C and associates with early endosomes in the cell body. They induce an alignment of early endosomes along actin filaments and markedly reduce the endosome motility by depending on Src tyrosine kinase activity. Thus RhoD is likely to utilize mDia3C for both the protrusion formation and the regulation of endosome movement through actin filaments. mDia3 is also localized to the kinetochores and involved in kinetochore-microtubule attachment required for correct chromosome alignment and segregation, which is regulated by Cdc42 or Aurora B (Yasuda et al., 2004;Cheng et al., 2011). Although it remains to be determined which mDia3 isoform(s) is responsible for this function, each of the mDia3 isoforms is likely to be regulated by specific signaling molecules and to exert specific functions.",

In addition, mDia3C(\u0394DAD) formed protrusions regardless of the expression of RhoD(G26V). mDia3C(\u0394DAD) was confined to the tips of the protrusions. These results may indicate that actin nucleation/ elongation function of mDia3C, which is activated by RhoD, is essential for the protrusion formation. However, the protrusions formed by mDia3C(\u0394DAD) were thicker and contained actin filament bundles thicker than those in the RhoD(G26V)-induced protrusions. Accordingly, although mDia3C is responsible for the thin actin filament bundle formation in the RhoD-induced protrusions, regulated activation of mDia3C mediated by RhoD may be required for the thin and long protrusion formation. Alternatively, cooperation between mDia3C and other effector proteins of RhoD might be necessary for the thin and long protrusion formation. The thicker protrusions are reminiscent of those formed by mDia2(\u0394DAD) expression (Block et al., 2008). Although the mDia2(\u0394DAD)-induced protrusions are club-shaped, however, mDia3C(\u0394DAD)-induced protrusions were rod-shaped or tapered and appeared to be longer than the mDia2(\u0394DAD)-induced protrusions. The difference might be ascribed to different nucleation/elongation abilities exhibited by these mDia proteins. Figure 9 summarizes postulated mechanisms of the protrusion formation by FGF-activated RhoD, elongation of the protrusions toward the source of FGF, and the transport of FGFRs through the protrusions. This study has substantiated the molecular mechanisms of cytoneme or cytoneme-like protrusion formation. Investigation of whether RhoD and mDia3C play central roles in the formation of similar protrusions distinct from filopodia in other cell types (Galkina et al., 2001;Gupta and DeFranco, 2003;Sherer et al., 2007;Fifadara et al., 2010) may generalize the findings in this study. If inactivating mutations occur in the RhoD, RhoD GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoD), or mDia3 gene, cytonemes or cytoneme-like protrusions may not be formed. ",
