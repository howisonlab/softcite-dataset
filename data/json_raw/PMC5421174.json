Clinically, the disease is characterized by the chronic progressive wasting and weakness of distal muscles in the lower limbs with sensory disturbance usually from the second decade. Some patients experience sensorineural hearing loss and central nervous system (CNS) involvement. [1-4] Nerve conduction velocity test shows a moderate neuropathy, and sural biopsy usually shows axonal or mixed axonal-demyelinating neuropathy pathology. [5,6] CMT1X has been described in Chinese patients since 2001. [3,7-19] Most of these were case reports, [8,14,17,19,20] summarized electrophysiological findings, [2,10,12-14,18] or pathological features in a few cases. [18,19] Here, we reported the clinical features and genetic mutations of GJB1 gene in a large Chinese patient cohort. meThods Ethical approval This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local Ethics Committee of Peking University First Hospital.

The exons and their flanking splice sites were captured and subsequently sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The sequencing files were mapped to reference sequences with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner and Picard tools and then called with control samples with the GATK 3.0 HaplotypeCaller (Broad Institute, USA). Nucleotide alternations were confirmed with Sanger sequencing. The segregation analyses of the mutations were confirmed in the parents and the affected family members. For the novel mutations, 1000 healthy controls of Chinese origin were screened. The biological relevance of the novel amino acid changes was studied using both PolyPhen-2 (http://www. genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/) and Mutation Taster (http:// www.mutationtaster.org/) programs.",

[30] This study confirmed that CNS involvement was common in Chinese CMT1X. Dysarthria and hemiparesis were the main symptoms of our patients, and other similar symptoms have been occasionally reported in other countries. [31][32][33][34][35][36] CNS symptoms developed after peripheral neuropathy symptoms in some patients in the present study, which has also been reported in previous studies. [32,36] Brain MRIs showed abnormal transient lesions involving bilateral white matter in all patients. However, the involvement of the corpus callosum which was frequently reported did not appear in all cases in the present study. [34,37] The isolated involvement of the centrum semiovale, internal capsule, and the periventricular area appeared in the present study as well as in other reports. [38,39] We found that the EC2 domain of Cx32 protein was more affected in our patients. The EC2 domain was a hotspot mutation domain and was affected in 44% of Korean patients, [40] which was more frequent compared to our patients. Mutations in the EC1 and EC2 domains of Cx32 were in 65% of the patients with Spanish or Portuguese descent. [41] However, EC1 and EC2 were not hotspot mutation domains in Japanese [24] and Malaysian [25] patients. We found no relationship between the position of mutations and CNS involvement in CMT1X. In the present series, mutations of five patients with CNS involvement were located in the N-terminal, TM1, and TM3 domains of GJB1 gene. The c.425G>A mutation was found in patients with pure peripheral neuropathy as well as in patients with additional CNS involvement. Four novel mutations in GJB1 gene were found in our cohort, which expands the spectrum of mutations in CMT1X.",
