There are different causes for acquired auricular defects, including trauma, tumor ablation and burns. The management options for upper, middle and lower third auricular defects are briefly reviewed in the current paper. Evidence Acquisition: Original research papers investigating the plastic surgeons, otolaryngologists and maxillofacial surgeons in approaching the complicated issue of auricular reconstruction published from January 1995 to December 2014 were aggregated and used in the current study. Results: Utilizing autologous stem cell populations to treat craniofacial defects is a promising field of ongoing investigations. Studies show that cartilage stem/progenitor cells (CSPCs) are highly chondrogenic and can produce elastic reconstructive material with long-term tissue restoration. Conclusions: Auricular reconstruction surgery is a challenging plastic procedure that requires great expertise and expert knowledge of the various techniques available. Novel techniques in the fields of reconstructive bioengineering and regenerative medicine are promising but further research is required before widespread clinical application.",

Traffic accidents, sports injuries, burns, bites and falls are major sources of traumatic injuries of the external ear (5). The most common etiologies are car accidents and bites that require appropriate antibiotics prior to delayed wound closure (6). Ear cancer is rare and most of the malignancies involve the skin of the external ear. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the leading tumor among non-melanoma skin cancers that involves the auricles. BCC most commonly involves the preauricular area and auricular helix and may result in considerable tissue destruction (7). Studies suggest that BCC of the ear is likely to be of an aggressive phenotype and most commonly affects men (8).",

Management of cauliflower ear is a challenging reconstructive procedure and requires reshaping of the auricle after excision of the deformed cartilage (17,18). Moreover, the bluntly traumatized auricle is vulnerable to infection, necrosis, and contracture. There was no consensus on the evidencebased management of acute auricular hematoma and systematic reviews of the literature highlighted the need for further research before recommending the optimal management strategies (19). The current management of auricular hematoma mainly depends on its size; while smaller hematomas should be aspirated; larger ones require open surgical drainage. Further studies are required to elucidate the efficacy of post-drainage interventions including splinting or bandaging (19,20). New techniques using fibrin glue and an 18-gauge catheter with a compression dressing are recently proposed. Cost-effectiveness and efficacy of these management options remain to be confirmed by further studies (20,21).Use of local flaps in soft tissue defects, initial realigning of the helical rim and anatomical repair of ear lacerations should be considered in management of acute ear trauma. In cases of ear ampu-tation, staged reconstruction or replantation techniques should be used (22).",

Depending on the extent of damage, primary repair, local flaps, skin grafts and regional flaps are used in the reconstructive procedures (27). A successful auricular reconstruction with satisfactory aesthetic results depends heavily on functional vascular supplies and decreased tension at the site of reconstruction to ensure tissue vitality. Currently, temporoparietal fascia flaps are widely used in regional flaps that provide a well-vascularized environment (28). Small defects could be reconstructed by excision and primary closure if decreased auricular height could be appropriately managed to avoid cupping of external ear structures (3). Use of various alternative flaps including superior pedicle postauricular chondrocutaneous flaps and autologous contralateral conchal cartilage grafts are promising and are topics of ongoing research (29,30). Reconstruction of the tragus can also be achieved with a preauricular cutaneous flap transposed to the defect and folded onto it. The flap can be based either inferiorly or superiorly.",

Fortunately, minor defects cause less cosmetic issues and hair may cover the site. For upper auricle defects, smaller than 2.8 cm, the helical advancement technique is advantageous and complications are rare (33). A variation of this flap, which is detached from the anterior and posterior helical surfaces, maximizes mobility at the cost of threatening tissue viability (34). In another variation, first described by Anita and Buch more than forty years ago, flap viability is not jeopardized but movement is considerably limited as the posterior skin remains intact (35). Large upper third defects are often managed by contralateral cartilage grafts and postauricular skin flaps and in case of insufficient graft donor sources, use of compound pedicle flaps is recommended (26,36). Preauricular flaps, designed at the junction of the ear and face with the pedicle based superiorly or inferiorly, may cover some small antihelical defects.",

However, the retroauricular skin is thinner and the deformed structures are more visible (37). Based on the same principles, chondrocutaneous advancement flaps could be also used in approaching middle third auricular defects (35). Good cosmetic results are reported by using superior pedicle postauricular chondrocutaneous flaps in management of full-thickness upper and middle third auricular defects (29). Reduced vertical height is a major problem if small middle third defects are repaired after turning the traumatized site into a wedge. Retroauricular composite flaps and autogenous cartilage harvested from conchal cartilage are used to reconstruct larger defects. Use of small local flaps raised from the lobule is an effective alternative in patients with abundant lobular tissue; recent studies highlight the simplicity and minimal anatomical deformity of this technique (38).",

In cases of full-thickness major trauma that involve a great proportion of the lobule, more burdensome techniques, using cartilage grafting, are often required. One famous technique is the double flap proposed by Preaux and modified by Brent who recommended the use of bipedicle chondrocutaneous flaps and contralateral cartilage grafts (39,40). Davis introduced another approach based on a mastoid flap for anterior earlobe reconstruction and a posterior flap turned over from the anterior helix surface (41). More easily implemented techniques are also gaining acceptance and reconstruction of ear lobule through a one-stage procedure is reported with favorable aesthetic and symmetric outcomes. These techniques include the use of the Limberg-flap, a doubleover skin flap, two superiorly based flaps rotated towards the middle or a bilobed flap with an anterior base (42-44).",

Reconstruction of the burned auricle is a significant challenge for most plastic surgeons. Early debridement of ear burn wounds before occurrence of irreversible cartilage changes is highly recommended. Surgeons' preference and local tissue availability are the most important variables to consider before choosing the optimal modality for repair (53,54). Integrity of the mastoid skin is considered a reliable prognostic factor in patients with burned auricles. Superficial temporal fascia or an indirect expansion could be used and in rare cases, free contralateral superficial temporal fascia may become necessary before placing a prosthesis (55). Use of postauricular advancement flaps and skin grafts to cover the helix and antihelix respectively are suggested as a straightforward technique with low complication rates to manage extensive ear burns acutely (56). In addition to postauricular skin and fascia, free radial forearm flaps and free lateral arm fascial flaps are also used to reconstruct the burned auricle. These techniques may be limited by lack of viable local tissues or free flaps following extensive burns (57). Innovative techniques combining scalp tissue expansion with porous polyethylene reconstruction is recently introduced, which use temporoparietal fascia flaps and does not require costochondral grafting (58). Use of bone-anchored extraoral implants is also investigated in burn patients with lasting aesthetic results and low complications (59).",

Auricular reconstruction surgery is a challenging plastic procedure that requires great expertise and expert knowledge of the various techniques available. Current techniques could be further modified with respect to their cost-effectiveness and simplicity. The reconstruction method is dependent on defect size and location. Novel techniques in the fields of reconstructive bioengineering and regenerative medicine are promising but further research is requirred before widespread clinical application.",
