Unfortunately, the price tag of well over $10 billion for the event is adding to the already considerable strain on government budgets in Brazil. Faced with a nasty recession, cuts in public services, and rising unemployment, throngs of Brazilians have turned out to protest what is seen as wasteful spending and a misallocation of resources on the Olympics. Throw in the growing threat of the Zika virus and Brazil may end up with larger crowds of agitators protesting the government than of sports fans cheering on the athletes. But are these complaints about Olympic spending justified? The quadrennial Summer Olympic Games is one of the world's premier sporting events, with over 10,000 athletes representing 204 countries, 300 individual events in 28 different sports, over 10 million tickets sold to spectators, and a worldwide television audience in the billions. On a somewhat smaller scale, the most recent Winter Olympic Games held in 2014 in Sochi, Russia, welcomed nearly 3,000 athletes from 88 countries to compete in 98 events in 15 disciplines while generating large revenues and massive television ratings. While most viewers tune in to watch the competition among the athletes, the battle among cities to be selected to host these events can be just as fierce. Although bidding cities have numerous reasons for wanting to host, none seems more prevalent than the desire for an economic windfall. In this paper, we explore the costs and",

On the cost side, there are three major categories: general infrastructure such as transportation and housing to accommodate athletes and fans; specific sports infrastructure required for competition venues; and operational costs, including general administration as well as the opening and closing ceremony and security. Three major categories of benefits also exist: the short-run benefits of tourist spending during the Games; the long-run benefits or the \"Olympic legacy\" which might include improvements in infrastructure and increased trade, foreign investment, or tourism after the Games; and intangible benefits such as the \"feel-good effect\" or civic pride.",

Furthermore, the cost-benefit proposition is worse for cities in developing countries than for those in the industrialized world. In closing, we discuss why what looks like an increasingly poor investment decision on the part of cities still receives significant bidding interest and whether changes in the bidding process of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will improve outcomes for potential hosts.",

The International Olympic Committee requires that the host city for the Summer Games have a minimum of 40,000 hotel rooms available for spectators and an Olympic Village capable of housing 15,000 athletes and officials. In addition, the city needs to have both internal and external transportation facilities that can get tourists to the city itself and then to the individual sports venues within the region. Hotel capacity alone can be a major challenge. Rio de Janeiro, already one of the most popular tourist destinations in South America, still required the construction of over 15,000 new hotel rooms for the 2016 Summer Games. While investment in the hospitality industry can in theory pay long-term dividends once the Games are over, heavy expenditures to meet a two-week period of peak demand may result in severe overcapacity once the event is over. For example, following the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, 40 percent of the town's full-service hotels went bankrupt (Teiglund 1999).",

In addition, the Olympics do generate significant sponsor, ticketing, licensing, and media revenues that can be used to offset the costs of staging the event. Table 3 shows data on revenues generated by the International Olympic Committee and the organizing committees for the Vancouver and London Games from the most recent IOC four-year budget cycle. In theory, the revenues generated from the Games can be divvied up any way the organizers see fit, but ultimately the IOC exercises complete control over the event and can share as much or as little of largesse as they deem fit subject to the constraint of finding a city willing to host the event. Most recently, television rights have represented nearly half of total revenues with the IOC sharing less than 30 percent of the total with the local Organizing Committees. Revenues from international sponsors are split between the International Olympic Committee and the Organizing Committees, while ticket revenue, domestic sponsorships, and licensing fees are kept by the host city. Obviously, the IOC could provide more generous subsidies to cities in order to defray the costs of hosting their tournaments, and international sports governing bodies, including the IOC, are often known for their lavish expenses. However, in the case of the London and Vancouver Games, the direct revenues generated by the games represented only a fraction of the total costs of hosting the event and would not have come close to covering the total costs even if the IOC had committed all revenue streams to the host committees, so one must rely on other sources of benefits to provide an economic justification for the events.",

It is perhaps telling to note that at the same time David Cameron's government in the United Kingdom was promoting the supposed expansionary effects of fiscal austerity in the wake of the Great Recession, the same government was touting the stimulative effects of increased government spending on London's Olympic preparations (Mullholland 2012). However, unless policymakers can predict recessions years ahead of time-given that the International Olympic Committee awards the Games seven years in advance-using the Olympics to pull a country out of recession would rest more on dumb luck rather than prudent planning. Otherwise, the spending involved with the Games is as likely to redistribute spending in an economy near full employment as it is to lift an economy out of recession. Indeed, unless unemployment is high, employment gains in construction are not an important economic benefit since they come at the cost of employment losses in other industries. That being said, various economic impact studies done in advance of the Olympic Games have often produced large estimates of economic gains. An InterVISTAS Consulting (2002) report on the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics predicted $10.7 billion (Canadian) in new economic output and 244,000 jobs compared to $4.8 billion (in 2002 dollars) and 35,000 job-years predicted in Salt Lake City eight years earlier by the state government of Utah (IOC 2010). The 1996 Atlanta Games were predicted to generate 77,026 jobs and $5.142 billion (in 1996 dollars) in economic activity, while the London Olympics promised \u00a31.936 billion in economic activity and an additional 8,164 full-time equivalent jobs created (Humphreys and Plummer 1995;Blake 2005).",

Baumann, Engelhardt, and Matheson (2012) examine monthly employment overall as well as in a variety of specific industries such as retail trade and leisure between 1990 and 2009 in Utah using employment in several adjacent states to control for regional employment trends around the time of the Olympics. They find no identifiable increase in employment either before or after the Olympics, and while they find a statistically significant bump in employment during the actual Games, the increase was 4,000 to 7,000 jobs, or roughly one-quarter to one-tenth the number claimed by Utah officials. Considering that the federal government spent $342 million directly on the 2002 Olympics and at least another $1.1 billion on infrastructure improvements leading up the Games, this amounts to about $300,000 in federal government spending per job created. Other studies listed in Table 4 find similar outcomes. Indeed, these results lend credence to a common rule-of-thumb often used by economists who study mega-events: If one wishes to know the true economic impact of an event, take whatever numbers the promoters are touting and move the decimal point one place to the left.",

One obvious answer is that economic impact studies are often commissioned by groups who have a vested interest in their outcome, and these groups choose firms that are likely to produce a favorable result. Estimates can be easily manipulated by making unrealistic assumptions about costs and benefits. The resulting claim of a large economic windfall may be used to curry public favor or to justify a large taxpayer subsidy.",

            "text": "Even when a highly positive estimate of Olympic benefits is not the explicit goal of an economic impact study, the methodology used in most studies is flawed in a way that biases the economic impact upwards. First, economic impact studies often ignore the \"substitution effect\" that occurs when local residents shift their spending from other goods in the local economy to the Olympics. If the study counts the purchase of a ticket by a local resident to an Olympic event without accounting for what would have been purchased in the absence of the Games, the impact of the Olympics will be overstated. For this reason, economists studying the effect of sporting events on local economies often advocate eliminating expenditures by local residents entirely. Second, the \"crowding out effect\" occurs when the crowds and congestion associated with a mega-event dissuades other regular tourists or business travelers from visiting the host region. Even when the number of out-of-town Olympics spectators is large, hotel rooms in the host city may normally be nearly full so that the net increase in visitor arrivals to the region is likely to be much smaller and perhaps even negative. For example, the UK Office for National Statistics (2015) reported that the number of international visitors to the country fell to 6,174,000 visitors in July and August 2012, the months of the Olympics, from 6,568,000 the year before, and some popular shows in London's theater district actually shut down during the Games. Similarly, Beijing reported a 30 percent drop in international visitors and a 39 percent drop in hotel occupancy during the month of the 2008 Games compared to the previous year. Utah ski resorts noted a 9.9 percent fall in skier days in the 2001-02 season during which the Salt Lake City Winter Games occurred, compared to the previous year along with a drop in taxable sales collections at these locations (Zimbalist 2015;Baade, Baumann, and Matheson 2010). Taxable sales and skier visits rebounded the following season, after the departure of the Olympic fans and athletes. Other host cities that have experienced an increase in visitors during the Olympics still routinely report net increases in tourism that are significantly below expectations-and typically lower than the number of identified ticket buyers. American baseball player Yogi Berra's famous quip, \"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded,\" may apply here.",

Clearly some level of tourist spending will recirculate in the economy as local businesses and workers re-spend a portion of any Olympic windfall that comes their way. At a very basic level, standard macroeconomic analysis suggests that the expenditure multiplier will be \u0394Y/\u0394spending = \u0394Y/Olympic spending = 1/(1 \u2212 marginal propensity to consume), so that a $1 increase in spending due to the Olympics will result in 1/(1 \u2212 MPC) extra dollars in total output for the host city. While every city and industry is different, it is common to see multipliers of roughly 2 applied to visitor spending, so that an initial increase in direct spending leads to a similar level of indirect spending and a doubling of the total economic impact.",

But as Matheson (2009) notes: \"During an event like the Olympics, however, the economy within a region may be anything but normal, and therefore, these same inter-industry relationships may not hold. Since there is no reason to believe that the usual economic multipliers are the same during mega-events, any economic analyses based upon these multipliers may, therefore, be highly inaccurate.\"",

Even critics of the Olympics like Porter and Fletcher (2008) concede that the Olympics typically cause a substantial increase in room rates. The wages paid to a hotel's desk clerks and room cleaners, however, are likely to remain roughly unchanged. As a hotel's revenue increases without a corresponding increase in labor costs, the return to capital rises while the return to labor falls as a percent of revenues. To the extent that hotels (as well as chain restaurants, car rental agencies, airlines, and similar firms) are nationally or internationally owned, this increase in corporate profits doesn't stick in the host city but instead leaves the area in which the profits were earned. In effect, due to these increased leakages, the MPC in the host city falls, thus reducing the multiplier effect during mega-events.",

For example, 80 percent of respondents surveyed by the BBC (2012) immediately after the 2012 Olympics reported that the event \"made them more proud to be British.\" Several studies have attempted to quantify the intangible benefits of the Olympics through the use of contingent valuation methodology, which constructs a set of survey questions that are designed to elicit the monetary value people place on whether certain events occur or do not occur. Using this approach, both Atkinson, Mourato, Szymanski, and Ozdemiroglu (2008) and Walton, Longo, and Dawson (2008) undertook sophisticated contingent valuation surveys using best practices for the 2012 London Olympics and found that persons both within London and throughout the United Kingdom expressed a willingness to pay to host the Games over and above any costs associated with actually attending any of the events. The total intangible value identified to UK residents in the studies was approximately \u00a32 billion (or roughly $3.4 billion at the exchange rates at the time of the study).

Furthermore, due to the nature of the sporting events sponsored by the Olympics, host cities are often left with specialized sports infrastructure that has little use beyond the Games, so that in addition to the initial construction costs, cities may be faced with heavy long-term expenses for the maintenance of \"white elephants.\" Many of the venues from the Athens Games in 2004 have fallen into disrepair. Beijing's iconic \"Bird's Nest\" Stadium has rarely been used since 2008 and has been partially converted into apartments, while the swimming facility next door dubbed the \"Water Cube\" was repurposed as an indoor water park at a cost exceeding $50 million (Farrar 2010). The Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, the site for most of the track and field events as well as the opening and closing ceremonies in 2012, was designed to be converted into a soccer stadium for local club West Ham United in order to avoid the \"white elephant\" problem. Before the Games, the stadium had an original price tag of \u00a3280 million. Cost overruns led to a final construction cost of \u00a3429 million, and then the conversion cost to remove the track and prepare the facility to accommodate soccer matches topped \u00a3272 million, of which the local club is paying only \u00a315 million (Sky Sports 2015).",

But here, too, a caveat is in order. It is often argued that the Olympics can serve as a catalyst for urban redevelopment and to generate the political will required to undertake needed infrastructure investments. However, there is no reason to believe that the investments required to host the Olympics will provide higher returns than alternative infrastructure projects that could have been carried out instead.

This strategy won't necessarily work for many other potential host cities. Lillehammer, Norway, the venue for the Winter Games in 1994, offered few attractions to tourists outside of the Olympic events and was therefore unattractive to tourists after the Games left town. By 1997, the increase in international guest-nights in Lillehammer was only 8 percent higher than the increase in foreign tourism in Norway overall (Tiegland 1999). Similarly, the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics significantly raised international awareness of the city, but without a lasting ability to attract tourists, the enhanced image of the city rapidly faded (Richie and Smith 1991). Conversely, London, with over 18 million international visitors per year, was already the most popular tourist destination in the world prior to the 2012 Olympics, and it was never likely that the event would raise its already impressive profile. The success of the Olympics in developing a city as a tourist destination should not be rejected out of hand, but neither is it a surefire way to ensure a steady stream of visitors after the closing ceremonies.",

To test for spurious correlation, Maennig and Richter (2012) and Langer, Maennig, and Richter (2015) note that when bidding countries are appropriately compared with countries that are otherwise similar but did not bid for the Games using propensity matching techniques, the significant Olympic effects on trade, consumption, investment, and income all disappear.

At least three possibilities arise. First, even if the overall effect of holding the Games is typically negative, large projects will still create winners and losers. Boston's ultimately unsuccessful bid to host the 2024 Summer Games was spearheaded by leaders in the heavy construction and hospitality industries, the two sectors of the economy that stood the most to gain from the city hosting the Olympics.",

The desire to host the Games may be driven by the egos of a country's leaders or as a demonstration of a country's political and economic power. It is difficult to explain Russia's $51 billion expenditure on the 2014 Sochi Games or China's $45 billion investment in the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics otherwise. In countries where the government is not accountable to voters or taxpayers, it is quite possible for the government to engage in wasteful spending that enriches a small group of private industrialists or government leaders without repercussions. In the bidding for the 2022 Winter Olympics, four of the cities in liberal western democracies that initially indicated interest in staging the Games-Oslo, Stockholm, Krakow, and Munich-withdrew from the bidding after local voters expressed opposition to the bids, leaving the International Olympic Committee to choose which autocratic regime would hold the event: Beijing, China, or Almaty, Kazakhstan. In the bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics, both Boston and Hamburg withdrew their bids in the face of public opposition.",

The 1970s witnessed a decline in enthusiasm among cities willing to host the Games. In 1972, voters in Denver, after having been initially awarded the 1976 Winter Olympics, rejected a $5 million bond referendum that would have been used to finance the Games, requiring the International Olympic Committee to rescind its offer. Following the financial debacle of the 1976 Montreal Olympics, by the time it came to award the 1984 Summer Games, Los Angeles was the only bidder. Given the resulting bargaining position, the Los Angeles Organizing Committee was able to dictate the terms of bid to the International Olympic Committee. For example, it insisted on utilizing the area's existing sports infrastructure, including the 60-year old Los Angeles Coliseum for the premier track and field events as well as the opening and closing ceremonies, and the heavy use of corporate sponsors to finance the Games. The focus on restraining costs resulted in total expenditures for the Games of a \"mere\" $546 million ($1,244 million in 2015 dollars), less than one-quarter of that spent by Montreal eight years earlier. The 1984 Los Angeles event managed to become one of the only profitable Games in Olympic history, with a final profit of $232.5 million (Walker 2014).",

However, this crop of new entrants meant that bargaining power shifted back to the International Olympic Committee. No longer could cities design bids based solely on expected revenues and the expenses necessary to stage the event. Instead, applicant cities needed to consider how to beat competing bids from other potential hosts. Not only did the competition among cities to host create a bidding environment prone to corruption, but it became commonplace for bidders to attempt to impress the International Olympic Committee with spectacular new architectural monuments like Beijing's Bird's Nest or the \u00a3269 million London Aquatics Centre. The estimated cost of the new, ultra-modern National Olympic Stadium in Tokyo, planned as the centerpiece of the 2020 Games, eventually rose to $2.02 billion-which for perspective was nearly twice the cost, even after accounting for inflation, of the entire 1984 Los Angeles Games-before public outcry led to a massive redesign (Ripley and Hume 2015).",

Concerns about costs are nothing new. Even Salt Lake City's $1.9 billion in expenditures in 2002 ($2.5 billion in 2015 dollars), which seem almost quaint by today's standards, raised concerns among organizers. Then-President of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, expressed the \"need to streamline costs and scale down the Games so the host cities are not limited to wealthy metropolises. \u2026 The scale of the Games is a threat to their quality,\" he said. \"In a way, they risk becoming a victim of their own success\" (as quoted in Roberts 2002).",

Even before Boston and Hamburg's withdrawals as applicant cities for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games, and even before only two applicant cities emerged as contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee had been considering major changes to its strategic vision.

The International Olympic Committee has yet to complete a full bidding cycle under their new guidelines, but some cities are taking its recommendation seriously. Los Angeles, which emerged as the US bid city for 2024 following Boston's exit, has proposed using existing college dormitories at UCLA and the University of Southern California for athlete housing during the Games, thus eliminating over $1 billion in costs for an athletes' village from their original plans. Of course, if the IOC again finds itself lured into selecting the city with the fanciest accommodations for athletes (and, of course, for IOC executives), the most glamorous new stadiums, and the most elaborate ceremonies over simpler but more economically rational bids like what may be emerging in Los Angeles, then the clear signal will be that it is business as usual for the Olympics. Furthermore, blame for such an outcome should not be directed solely at the International Olympic Committee. Managing expectations is critical. Promising that hosting the Olympics will provide a significant boost to a host city and nation's economy is very likely to result in disappointment. Host cities and nations have to be more proactive, rather than permitting economic interests who stand to benefit from the Games to serve as the primary spokespersons for economic impact. Officials from national Organizing Committees should do more hands-on-management to ensure that the promises of vested interests are reasonable and achievable.",

As yet another alternative, the IOC might award two successive Games to the same host, so that facilities could at least be used twice.

If the commercial dimension of the Games has become too embedded to eliminate, then the costs must be managed better; infrastructure has to be made less expensive and reused; host nations and cities have to play the lead role in defining and achieving reasonable economic outcomes; and corruption has to be targeted through increased transparency and broader involvement. The goal should be that the costs of hosting are matched by benefits that are shared in a way to include ordinary citizens who fund the event through their tax dollars.
