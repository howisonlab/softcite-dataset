Materials and Methods: Seventy-eight patients (43 men and 35 women) with 86 hepatic lesions and 20 pancreatico-biliary diseases underwent MRI including T2WIs acquired using breath-hold (BH), respiratory-triggered (RT), and MultiVane technique at 3T. Two reviewers evaluated each T2WI with respect to artefacts, organ sharpness, and conspicuity of intrahepatic vessels, hilar duct, and main lesion using five-point scales, and made pairwise comparisons between T2WI sequences for these categories. Diagnostic accuracy (Az) and sensitivity for hepatic lesion detection were evaluated using alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: MultiVane T2WI was significantly better than BH-T2WI or RT-T2WI for organ sharpness and conspicuity of intrahepatic vessels and main lesion in both separate reviews and pairwise comparisons (p < 0.001). With regard to motion artefacts, MultiVane T2WI or BH-T2WI was better than RT-T2WI (p < 0.001). Conspicuity of hilar duct was better with BH-T2WI than with MultiVane T2WI (p = 0.030) or RT-T2WI (p < 0.001). For detection of 86 hepatic lesions, sensitivity (mean, 97.7%) of MultiVane T2WI was significantly higher than that of BH-T2WI (mean, 89.5%) (p = 0.008) or RT-T2WI (mean, 84.9%) (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Applying the MultiVane technique to T2WI of the liver is a promising approach to improving image quality that results in increased detection of focal liver lesions compared with conventional T2WI.",

Of the 78 patients, 58 had focal liver lesions as follows: 23 had 35 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (size range, 0.8-9 cm), 15 had 18 hemangioma (size range, 0.6-3.0 cm), 12 had 25 metastases from colorectal cancer (size range, 0.5-3.5 cm), four had four abscesses (size range, 1.5-4.5 cm), three had three masses forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (size range, 3.5-5.5 cm), and one had focal nodular hyperplasia (size 10 cm). The remaining 20 patients had pancreatic cystic lesions including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (n = 12) and serous cystic neoplasm (n = 1), common bile duct stone (n = 4), and pancreatic ducal adenocarcinoma (n = 3). All 23 patients with HCCs and one patient with cholangiocarcinoma had liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis associated with viral hepatitis B (n = 21) and viral hepatitis C (n = 3).

For T2WI free from motion artefacts, modifications to the basic protocol may include the addition of free-breathing sequences, respiratory-gating, and motion correction techniques (i.e., BLADE, PROPELLER, or radial acquisition of k-space) (7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14). Periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER [General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA] or BLADE [Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany]) or MultiVane (Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) is a technique that employs multiple data acquisition at the k-space center for the correction of in-plane motion by matching lowresolution images reconstructed from each set of echo train segments (10,13). MultiVane is a recently introduced motion correction technique that is similar to the PROPELLER technique (13) using rotating blades in the k-space, which makes it possible to detect in-plane motion that affects the low frequency in the center of k-space and correct in-plane motion for each blade to reduce motion effects in the images.",

Subjective image ratings for each image were compared using the Friedman test. Dunn's multiplecomparisons test was used as the post-hoc test. The kjronline.org pairwise comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon test corrected for multiple comparisons according to the Bonferroni adjustment. The diagnostic accuracy of each pulse sequence for the detection of focal hepatic lesions was determined using an alternative free-response receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on a lesion-bylesion basis. Considering the possible influence of lesion clustering on the diagnostic accuracy, nonparameric analysis of clustered ROC curve data was performed by using the method proposed by Obuchowski (20). The sensitivity for each set of images was evaluated according to the number of lesions assigned confidence levels of 3 or 4 from among the 86 liver lesions. We used our own method (21) for comparing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. The kappa statistic for two observers was calculated to assess the inter-observer agreement regarding pairwise comparison between T2WIs. Table 1 summarises the results of consensus review for motion artefact; anatomic sharpness of organs margin; and conspicuity of intrahepatic vessels, hilar bile duct, and main lesion for the three different T2WI sequences.

In the current study, MultiVane T2WI was significantly better than BH-T2WI with regard to anatomic sharpness of organ and conspicuity of intrahepatic vessels and main lesion in both separate reviews and pairwise comparison (p < 0.05), although there was no significant difference in artefacts between the sequences. In pairwise comparison between MultiVane T2WI and BH-T2WI, only two cases were judged as slightly inferior (score 2) with MultiVane T2WI compared with BH-T2WI for artefact, lesion conspicuity, and organ sharpness and three cases were slightly inferior for vessel conspicuity.

Theoretical advantages of central k-space oversampling using BLADE, PROPELLER, or MultiVane is the reduction of artefacts associated with gross motion and a better SNR (8)(9)(10)13). However, motion of the upper abdomen is mainly through-plane motion from respiratory movement rather than in-plane motion that occurs in a rigid body such as the brain. Therefore, gross motion correction was not applied in our study. Nevertheless, our results showed the usefulness of applying MultiVane technique for high-quality liver T2WI, which are consistent with prior reports (8)(9)(10).",

            "text": "Liver MRI is more vulnerable to artefacts than MRI for other organs because of the proximity of the liver to lung or the gastrointestinal tract, which hinders lesion detection. In addition, clear differentiation between tiny lesions and end-on views of vessels is problematic in T2WI with poor image quality. Thus, the results for qualitative analysis regarding liver lesion detection seem to be a more relevant indicator of image contrast and quality than quantitative analysis. With regard to the detection of 86 hepatic lesions, the Az value and sensitivity of MultiVane T2WI were significantly higher than those of BH-T2WI or RT-T2WI for both observers (p < 0.05). With the popular use of gadoxetic acid for liver MRI, the role of T2WI for lesion characterisation is being emphasised because early hepatocyte uptake of gadoxetic acid might cause falsepositive diagnosis of a small haemangioma as malignancy (22,23). In this regard, our observations have clinical impact. In the aforementioned cases, BH-T2WI or RT-T2WI did not suffer from severe artefacts that hindered tumour detection. In addition to the benefit of artefact-free images in MultiVane T2WI, another possible reason for our findings is higher SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in MultiVane T2WI as a result of acquiring multiple data at the k-space centre, which is responsible for contrast resolution (15). However, we did not acquire quantitative results because there has been no perfect noise estimation given the use of parallel imaging for BH-or RT-T2WI and T2WIs were acquired after the administration of gadoxetic acid (24).",

            "text": "With regard to the conspicuity of the hilar bile duct, BH-T2WI was significantly better than MultiVane T2WI (p = 0.005). Based on the above considerations, it is recommended to acquire both BH-T2WI, possibly as heavily T2WI, and MultiVane T2WI. However, the long acquisition time for MultiVane T2WI (mean, 6 minutes 30 seconds) may be a burden in a time-pressed environment. The MultiVane T2WI used in the current study was acquired with neither parallel imaging nor half scan and interleaved sampling. Further investigations with application of those techniques to MultiVane T2WI will be warranted to shorten image acquisition time while maintaining high image quality. In the gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI protocol, introducing MultiVane T2WI during the long waiting time between early dynamic phases and the 20-minute hepatobiliary phase could be a reasonable approach to adopting a shortened protocol, because T2WIs acquired after administration of gadoxetic acid are reported to be comparable to precontrast T2WIs in the detection and characterization of hepatic tumours (25)(26)(27).",

            "text": "There are several limitations in our study that should be mentioned. First, owing to the retrospective study design, we acquired T2WIs during the interval between the dynamic images and the 20-minute hepatobiliary phase in order to shorten examination time. Given that signal intensity of the lesion or liver might be altered by T1-or T2 effects of administered gadoxetic acid (25,28), a bias might be introduced to the conspicuity of the hepatic lesion. However, lesion-liver contrast on postcontrast T2WI is reportedly comparable to that on precontrast T2WI (25)(26)(27)(28). Second, there was a minimal difference in matrix size among the three T2WIs. However, despite the fact that MultiVane T2WI had the lowest reconstructed matrix size, we achieved better results with MultiVane T2WI than the other two techniques. Third, although image review was performed in a blinded manner, an experienced on-site reviewer might recognize which technique was applied. Fourth, we did not attempt to adjust parameters to optimise MultiVane T2WI for the liver by multiple testing of MultiVane percentages to balance the trade-off between image quality and acquisition time. Fifth, as previously mentioned, we did not perform quantitative measurement for SNR and CNR because of variability in image acquisition techniques among the three T2WI sequences. In addition, as a result of the retrospective study design, we did not optimise conventional BH-T2WI or RT-T2WI to maximise SNR and CNR.",
