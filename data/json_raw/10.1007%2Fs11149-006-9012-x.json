In this paper, we evaluate the social welfare implications of transmission investments based on equilibrium models characterizing the competitive interaction among generation firms whose decisions in generation capacity investments and production are affected by both the transmission investments and the congestion management protocols of the transmission system operator. Our analysis shows that both the magnitude of the welfare gains associated with transmission investments and the location of the best transmission expansions may change when the generation expansion response is taken into consideration.

            "text": "Within the past decade, many countries-including the US-have restructured their electric power industries, which essentially have changed from being dominated by vertically integrated regulated monopolies (where the generation and the transmission sectors were jointly planned and operated) to deregulated industries (where generation and transmission are both planned and operated by different entities). Under the integrated monopoly structure, planning and investment in generation and transmission, as well as operating procedures, were, at least in theory, closely coordinated through an integrated resource planning (IRP) process that accounted for the complementarity and substitutability between the available resources in meeting reliability and economic objectives. 1 The vertical separation of the generation and transmission sectors has resulted in a new operations and planning paradigm where IRP is no longer a viable alternative. Planning and investment in the privately owned generation sector is driven by economic considerations in response to market prices and incentives. The transmission system, on the other hand, is operated by independent transmission organizations that may or may not own the transmission assets. Whether the transmission system is owned by the system operator as in the UK or by separate owners as in some parts of the US, the transmission system operator plays a key role in assessing the needs for transmission investments from reliability and economic perspectives and in evaluating proposed investments in transmission. With few exceptions, the primary drivers for transmission upgrades and expansions are reliability considerations and interconnection of new generation facilities. 2 However, because the operating and investment decisions by generation companies are market driven, valuation of transmission expansion projects must also anticipate the impact of such investments on market prices and demand response. Such economic assessments must be carefully scrutinized since market prices are influenced by a variety of factors including the ownership structure of the generation sector, the network 1 Arguably an idealized IRP was never practical for various reasons including institutional ones, which prevented or delayed various transmission projects (the California-Oregon transmission project and Devers-Palo Verde 2 project in California were cited as examples of IRP failures by one of the referees). 2 In this paper, we refer to transmission upgrades driven by reliability considerations as the transmission expansions that safely and reliably support increased demand and interconnections of new generation facilities to the grid, according to the reliability standards established by NERC, WECC, and Local Reliability Criteria. topology, the distribution and elasticity of demand, uncertainties in demand, as well as generation and network contingencies.",

These assessments typically ignore market power effects and potential strategic response by generation investments to the transmission upgrades. For example, the Transmission Economic Assessment Methodology (TEAM) developed by the California ISO (2004) is based on the \"gains from trade\" principle (see (Sheffrin, 2005)), which ignores possible distortion due to market power. 3 The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a methodology for assessing the economic impact of transmission investment while anticipating the strategic response of oligopolistic generation companies in generation investment and in the subsequent spot market behavior. We evaluate the social-welfare implications of transmission investments based on equilibrium models characterizing the competitive interaction among the generation firms whose decisions in generation capacity investments and production are affected by both the transmission investments and the congestion management protocols of the transmission system operator. In particular, we formulate a three-period model for studying how the exercise of local market power by generation firms affects the equilibrium between the generation and the transmission investments and, in this way, the valuation of different transmission expansion projects. In our model, we determine the social-welfare implications of transmission investments by solving a simultaneous Nash-Cournot game that characterizes the market equilibrium with respect to production quantities and prices. Our model accounts for the transmission network constraints, through a lossless DC approximation of Kirchoff's laws, as well as for demand uncertainty and for generation and transmission contingencies. Generation firms are assumed to choose their output levels at each generation node so as to maximize profits given the demand functions, the production decisions of their rivals and the import/export decisions by the system operator who is charged with maintaining network feasibility while maximizing social welfare. Assuming linear demand functions and quadratic generation cost functions the simultaneous set of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions characterizing the market equilibrium is a linear complementarity problem (LCP) for which we can compute a unique solution.",

Unlike the assumptions made in our model, two key assumptions regarding generation investment underlying TEAM are: (i) investment in new generation capacity is non-strategic and independent of transmission planning and (ii) new investment in generation capacity is just sufficient to maintain prices at levels that are competitive while providing an adequate rate of return. proactive network planning (PNP) since it accounts for the ability of a network planner to influence generation investment and the subsequent spot market behavior.

The main idea behind these papers is that if an expensive generator with local market power is requested to produce power as result of network congestion, then the generation firm owning this generator may not have an incentive to relieve congestion. Borenstein, Bushnell, and Stoft (2000) present an analysis of the relationship between transmission capacity and generation competition in the context of a two-node network in which there is local demand at each node. The authors argue that relatively small transmission investment may yield large payoffs in terms of increased competition. Bushnell and Stoft (1996) propose to grant financial rights (which are tradable among market participants) to transmission investors as reward for the transmission capacity added to the network and suggest a transmissionrights allocation rule based on the concept of feasible dispatch. They prove that, under certain circumstances, such a rule can eliminate the incentives for a detrimental grid expansion. However, these conditions are very stringent. Joskow and Tirole (2000) analyze the Bushnell-and-Stoft's model under assumptions that better reflect the physical and economic attributes of real transmission networks. They show that a variety of potentially significant performance problems then arise.",

However, firms can own generation capacity at multiple nodes. Generation firms may exercise local market power and their interaction is characterized through Cournot competition as detailed below. The model consists of three periods, as displayed in Fig. 1. We assume that, at each period, all previous-periods actions are observable to the players who base their current decisions on that information and on their \"correct\" rational expectation about the behavior of all other players in the current period and on subsequent period outcomes. Thus, the proactive transmission investment valuation model is characterized as a \"complete-and perfect-information\" game 6 and the equilibrium as \"sub game perfect\". This model is static. That is, the model parameters (demand and cost functions, electric characteristics of the transmission lines, etc.) do not change over time. One way of interpreting this model is considering that it represents an investment cycle with sufficient lead time between the periods while period 3 encapsulates the average outcomes of a recurring spot energy market realization under multiple demand and supply contingencies. For each realization of demand uncertainty and transmission and generation contingencies, we compute the spot market equilibrium outcomes and calculate the average or expected profits of the generation firms over all possible realizations. 7 All the costs and benefits represented in the model are annualized.",

For the sake of tractability, we assume that generators' production decisions are not constrained by physical capacity limits. Instead, we allow generators' marginal cost curves to rise smoothly so that production quantities at any node will be limited only by economic considerations and transmission constraints. In this framework, generation expansion is modeled as \"stretching\" the supply function so as to lower the marginal cost at every output level and thus increase the amount of economic production at any given price. Such expansion can be interpreted as an increase in generation capacity in a way that preserves the proportional heat curve or, alternatively, assuming that any new generation capacity installed will replace old, inefficient plants and, thereby, increase the overall efficiency of the portfolio of plants in producing a given amount of electricity. This continuous representation of the supply function and generation expansion serves as a proxy to actual supply functions that end with a vertical segment at the physical capacity limit. Since typically generators are operated so as not to hit their capacity limits (due to high heat rates and costly wear on the generators), our proxy should be expected to produce realistic results."

In Fig. 2, this correspondence is represented by the dashed curve. The optimal solution of the PNP model is at the intersection of these two correspondences. That is, the transmission capacity chosen by the PNP, f * PNP , is such that f * (g * (f * PNP )) = f * PNP . On the other hand, the transmission capacity chosen by the RNP, f * RNP , is on the correspondence f * (g), at the currently installed generation capacities (i.e., f * RNP = f * (g 0 )), as Fig. 2 suggests). Thus, the optimal solution of the second period of the RNP model is on the correspondence g * (f ), at transmission capacities f * RNP . Since the correspondence g * (f ) characterizes the optimality conditions of the period-2 problem in the PNP model, any pair (g * (f ), f ) represents a feasible solution of the PNP model. Consequently, the optimal solution of the RNP model,(g * (f * RNP ), f * RNP ), is a feasible solution of the PNP model, as it is evident in Fig. 2.

We solve it, for each contingent state, by minimizing the complementarity conditions subject to the linear equality constraints and the non-negativity constraints. 17 The period-2 problem of the PNP model is an EPEC, in which each firm faces a Mathematical Program subject to Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC). 18 We attempt to solve for equilibrium, if at least one exists, by iterative deletion of dominated strategies. That is, we sequentially solve each firm's profit-maximization problem using as data the optimal values from previously solved problems. Thus, starting from a feasible solution, we solve for g 1 using g (\u22121) as data in the first firm's optimization problem (where g (\u22121) means all firms' generation capacities except for firm 1's), then solve for 17 Recall that any LCP can be written as the problem of finding a vector x \u2208 n such that x = q + M \u2022 y, x T \u2022 y = 0, x \u2265 0, and y \u2265 0, where M \u2208 n\u00d7n , q \u2208 n , and y \u2208 n . Thus, we can solve it by minimizing x T \u2022 y subject to x = q + M \u2022 y, x \u2265 0, and y \u2265 0. If the previous problem has an optimal solution where the objective function is zero, then that solution also solves the corresponding LCP. Greater details about the methodology used for solving LCPs are given in (Hobbs, 2001). 18 See (Yao et al., 2004) for definitions of both EPEC and MPEC. g 2 using g (\u22122) as data, and so on. We solve each firm's profit-maximization problem using a sequential quadratic programming algorithm implemented in MATLAB . We test our model from a set of different starting points and using different generation-firms' optimization order. All these trials gave us the same results. For the PNP model, the optimal levels of generation capacity under absence of transmission investments are (g * 1 , g * 2 , g * 3 , g * 4 , g * 5 ,g * 6 ) = (100. 92, 103.72, 101.15, 95.94, 77.07, 87.69) in MW.

In assessing the economic impacts of the alternative line expansions, we compare social-welfare implications along with the impact on market power (measured by an average Lerner index 20 ), producer and 19 For simplicity, in the case of upgrading an existing line, we assume that the upgrade does not alter the electric characteristics, but only the thermal capacity of the line (for instance, this would be the case if, for the expanded line, we replaced all the wires by \"low sag wires\" while using the same existing high-voltage towers). On the other hand, in the case of building a line at a new location, we consider that the PTDF matrices change according to both the new network structure and the electric characteristics of the new line. For all new-line expansion projects, we evaluate the impact of the construction of a transmission line with thermal capacity equal to 100 MVA, resistance equal to 0.01 p.u., and reactance equal to 0.04 p.u. 20 The Lerner Index is defined as the fractional price markup i.e. (Price \u2212 Marginal cost)/Price. consumer surplus as well as congestion rents. In Table 4, \"Avg.

From Table 4, it is evident that the highest valued (in terms of expected social welfare) single transmission line expansion is a new line connecting nodes 20 and 22. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that some expansion projects (as adding 100 MVA on line 15-18) can decrease social welfare. Now, we are interested in comparing the PNP \"best expansion\" with that obtained under the RNP paradigm for the same system conditions. We tested the RNP decision by comparing the results of independently adding 100 MVA of capacity to each one of the same (existing and new) eight lines as before.

In particular, we proposed a three-period model for studying how the exercise of local market power by generation firms affects the equilibrium between the generation and the transmission investments and, in this way, the valuation of different transmission expansion projects. We showed that, although a PNP cannot do better (in terms of expected social welfare) than an IRP, it can recoup some of the lost welfare by identifying transmission investment options that are ex-post optimal given the strategic investment response by generation companies. We also proved that a RNP cannot do better (in terms of expected social welfare) than the PNP. Moreover, we illustrated through a numerical example that the valuations of transmission investments under the RNP paradigm can result in the selection of transmission expansion options that are inferior to those selected based on the PNP valuation, given the generation investment response to such expansions. Indeed, the PNP valuation methodology can identify more socially efficient expansion options than the RNP because it takes into consideration not only the welfare gained directly by adding transmission capacity, but also the way in which the transmission investment alters the Nash equilibria of expected generation capacities."

On the other hand, the PNP paradigm can be readily implemented as part of an economic assessment methodology employed by system operators. Such implementation requires, however, that transmission planning be centralized in a regional organization such as an ISO, an RTO or a regional performance-based-regulated ITC who will take the lead in identifying investment priorities. In doing so, the planner is able to respond to current needs and also guide future generation investment in the public interest. This view is contrary to the prevailing generation-centric view that gives priority to market-driven generation investment decisions and to merchant transmission investments while the ISO/RTO plays a passive (reactive) role. In this role the ISO/RTO evaluates transmission investment proposals as they come in and supplements them as needed to meet reliability requirements dictated by load growth and new generation investments. Unfortunately, this reactive approach is likely to lead to piece mill investment in the transmission infrastructure that is likely to be socially suboptimal in the long run.  "
