            "text": "Cathepsin B is a cysteine proteinase that primarily functions as an endopeptidase within endolysosomal compartments in normal cells. However, during tumoral expansion, the regulation of cathepsin B can be altered at multiple levels, thereby resulting in its overexpression and export outside of the cell. This may suggest a possible role of cathepsin B in alterations leading to cancer progression. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of intracellular and extracellular cathepsin B in growth, tumorigenesis, and invasion of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Results show that mRNA and activated levels of cathepsin B were both increased in human adenomas and in CRCs of all stages. Treatment of CRC cells with the highly selective and non-permeant cathepsin B inhibitor Ca074 revealed that extracellular cathepsin B actively contributed to the invasiveness of human CRC cells while not essential for their growth in soft agar. Cathepsin B silencing by RNAi in human CRC cells inhibited their growth in soft agar, as well as their invasion capacity, tumoral expansion, and metastatic spread in immunodeficient mice. Higher levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 were observed in cathepsin B-deficient tumors as well as an increase in cyclin B1. Finally, cathepsin B colocalized with p27 Kip1 within the lysosomes and efficiently degraded the inhibitor. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that cathepsin B is a significant factor in colorectal tumor development, invasion, and metastatic spreading and may, therefore, represent a potential pharmacological target for colorectal tumor therapy.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major malignancies worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in North America. CRC develops through multiple steps, with the sequential acquisition of genetic alterations in key tumor suppressors and oncogenes. This knowledge has been largely derived from early research on CRC [1]. The phenotypic hallmarks of cancer cells include the ability to invade and metastasize which depends on the action of proteases actively taking center stage in extracellular proteolysis during cancer progression [2]. Of all the proteases, the cysteine protease cathepsin B is of significant importance as it is involved in various pathologies and oncogenic processes [3]. Cathepsin B primarily functions as an endopeptidase within endolysosomal compartments in normal cells. However, during malignant transformation, the regulation of cathepsin B can be altered at multiple levels thereby resulting in its overproduction [3,4]. Mechanisms that increase cathepsin B expression in tumors and in tumor-associated cells include genetic amplification or alternative splicing [4]. Moreover, in tumors, cathepsin B can either be secreted, bound to the cell membrane or released by shedding vesicles [4]. Expression and redistribution of active cathepsin B to the basal plasma membrane occurs in late colon adenomas [5,6] coincident with the activation of KRAS [1]. In line with these results, Cavallo-Medved et al. [7] have demonstrated that trafficking of cathepsin B to caveolae and its secretion are regulated by active KRAS in CRC cells in culture. Accordingly, secretion of cathepsin B is increased in the extracellular environment of CRC [8,9] where it is suspected to play an essential role in disrupting extracellular matrix barriers between tumors and surrounding tissue, thereby facilitating invasion and metastasis [10][11][12]. Altogether, these data are consistent with the link between cathepsin B protein expression in colorectal carcinomas and shortened patient survival [6].",

Moreover, other studies have suggested that cathepsin B expression or activity may actually peak during early stage cancer and subsequently decline with advanced disease [14,15]. Thus, the above data point to a possible role of cathepsin B in both early and late alterations leading to tumor formation in the colon.",

The oligonucleotide-annealed products were subcloned into pLenti6-U6 between the BamHI and XhoI sites. Lentiviruses produced in 293 T cells were used for infection according to Invitrogen recommendations (ViraPower Lentiviral Expression System). No induction of OAS1 gene expression was detected by Q-PCR analysis in the experiments involving lentiviruses infection (data not shown). OAS1 is a classic interferon target gene recommended as a key test for interferon induction before attributing a particular response to the targeted gene [17]. The full-length human p27 Kip1 cDNA was subcloned after PCR amplification in expression vector pCDNA3.1.

Of note, increased cathepsin B expression was more prominent in tumors exhibiting APC mutations. By contrast, there did not appear to be a significant difference relative to KRAS mutations ( Figure 1B). To establish whether these increased mRNA levels could be correlated with increased cathepsin B protein levels and more importantly with increased activity, expression of the active processed forms of the protease (25 and 30 kDa) was analyzed by Western blot. Both procathepsin B and active cathepsin B were also increased in colorectal tumors compared to normal tissues ( Figure 1C and D). These data hence suggest that increased transcription contributes to a greater expression of active cathepsin B in CRC.",

As shown in Figure 2A, the proactive and catalytically active processed forms of cathepsin B were detected at various levels in CRC cell lines. Selected cathepsin B presence was also confirmed in conditioned culture medium of CRC cells, again at various levels (Figure 2A, lower panel). However, while the proform of cathepsin B was readily observed in conditioned culture medium of all CRC cells, the catalytically-active processed forms of cathepsin B were not detected in Western blot analyses. Additionally, using a fluorescence-based enzymatic assay, no cathepsin B enzyme activity was detected in conditioned medium. Since the pro-protease form might be activated under acidic pH conditions (peri-or extracellular) and by extracellular components of the extracellular matrix, the impact of extracellular inhibition of cathepsin B activation on CRC cell invasion was verified using Biocoat Matrigel chambers. HT-29, DLD1, and SW480 CRC cell lines secreting different levels of pro-cathepsin B (Figure 2A) were tested. Experiments were performed using the highly selective and non-permeant inhibitor Ca074 to reduce extracellular cathepsin B activity. At 10 mM, Ca074 produced a >99% inhibition of recombinant cathepsin B levels while barely reducing intracellular cathepsin B, that is, 5-8%, even upon 12 h exposure to the inhibitor (data not shown). Of note, treatment with 10 mM Ca074 significantly inhibited Matrigel invasion by approximately 45-60% in HT29, DLD1, and SW480 CRC cell lines ( Figure 2B). By contrast, treatment with Ca074 had no significant effect on their capacity to form colonies in soft agarose ( Figure 2C).",

As shown in Figure 3A, intracellular cathepsin B mRNA and protein levels were decreased in HT29 and DLD1 cells in comparison to a control shRNA which had no effect. Reduction of cathepsin B expression modestly slowed the proliferation rate of HT29 and DLD1   populations in 2D cell culture ( Figure 3B). Conversely, cathepsin B silencing significantly reduced the ability of HT29 and DLD1 cells to form colonies in soft agarose ( Figure 3C). This indicates that intracellular cathepsin B controls anchorage-independent growth of CRC cells given the absence of Ca074 effect ( Figure 2C). Moreover, cathepsin B silencing also reduced the number of invading HT29 and DLD1 cells to a similar extent as Ca074 treatment ( Figure 3D vs. Figure 2B).",

However, higher levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 were observed in cathepsin B-deficient tumors while p21 Cip and p57 Kip2 levels were not significantly affected. Of note, this increase in p27 Kip1 expression observed in cathepsin B-deficient tumors was associated with significant lower cyclin B1 expression in most tumors ( Figure 4C and D), suggesting reduced proliferative activity. These data thus suggest that cathepsin B silencing in CRC cells severely reduces their capacity to form tumors in vivo likely through the increased expression of p27 Kip1 .",

Next, to determine whether p27 Kip1 could be degraded by cathepsin B in vitro, lysates from 293 T cells overexpressing HA-tagged p27 Kip1 were incubated with purified cathepsin B and analyzed by Western blot. Figure 5B and C shows that cathepsin B degraded p27 Kip1 in a time-dependent manner as visualized by the accumulation of three lower molecular mass species (26,20, and 12 kDa) in addition to the full-length p27 Kip1 protein (see arrows versus arrowhead).",

At least five of these sequences can be found within the human p27 Kip1 sequence ( Figure 5D). Therefore, the first amino acid of these doublets was mutated into alanine to test whether it would affect the degradation by cathepsin B.

All of these mutants were expressed in 293 T cells and lysates subsequently exposed to cathepsin B cleavage (data not shown). The lower fragment was not observed with the p27 D96-100 mutant following cathepsin B cleavage, suggesting the presence of a cleavage site within this sequence ( Figure 5E). This particular sequence contains a glycine, and cathepsin B endopeptidase specificity has been reported to be also guided by the presence of a glycine in position P3 0 of the scissile bound [21]. Of note, the 12-and 20-kDa fragments were not observed when arginine 152 was mutated in alanine in the D96-100 mutant ( Figure 5E). Moreover, with the p27D189-198 mutant, both the 12-and 20-kDa fragments were still detected ( Figure 5F), although the modest shift-down of 1-2 kDa normally produced following cathepsin B cleavage of full-length p27 Kip1 was not observed ( Figure 5F, lower less-exposed gel). Single point mutation of each amino acid in the 189-198 sequence did not prevent the generation of the 26-kDa fragment following cathepsin B treatment ( Figure 5F for residue 189 as an example). This suggests that this 26-kDa fragment probably results from the exopeptidase activity of cathepsin B.",

Thereafter, cells were lysed at different time intervals in order to analyze protein expression levels of p27 Kip1 forms. As shown in Figure 6A, following cycloheximide treatment,  ; putative cleavage sites of cathepsin B are indicated in bold and underlined. The sequence of amino acids deleted in each p27 Kip1 deletion mutant generated is highlighted in grey. (E and F) The cDNA encoding HA-tagged p27 Kip1 and indicated mutants were transfected transiently in 293T cells. After 48 h, cells were lysed and 7.5 mg of protein lysates were incubated during 30 min with purified human cathepsin B (300 ng) at 378C (pH 6.0). Proteins were then solubilized in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting for the expression of HA-27 Kip1 , cathepsin B, and b-actin. Figure 6. Cathepsin B reduces p27 Kip1 stability. (A) The cDNA encoding HA-tagged wild-type p27 Kip1 and R152A/496-100 mutant were transiently transfected in 293T cells. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX, 30 mg/mL) and harvested after 0, 2, 6, 8, or 10 h. Cells were processed and lysed at the same time. Expression of HA-27 Kip1 proteins and b-actin was analyzed by Western blotting. Representative Western blot analysis is shown in upper panel. The graph illustrates the densitometric analysis of data from three independent experiments. HA-p27 Kip1 expression at 0 h of cycloheximide was set at 100%. Relative HA-p27 Kip1 protein levels were calculated using b-actin as reference.

            "text": "To confirm that p27 Kip1 also interacts with cathepsin B in CRC cells, their respective putative colocalization was examined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure 7A, the anti-cathepsin B antibody confirmed the colocalization of cathepsin B (in green) with the lysosomal acidotropic probe LysoTracker (in red). As expected, most of p27 Kip1 staining (in green) was observed in the cell nucleus ( Figure 7B). However, certain areas of colocalization were observed between endogenous p27 Kip1 (in green) and cathepsin B (in red) ( Figure 7B,  asterisks). Moreover, Western blot analyses revealed the presence of p27 Kip1 protein in lysosome-enriched fractions obtained from differential centrifugation of Caco-2/15 and SW480 cell lysates ( Figure 7C and D). These lysosomal fractions were enriched in lysosomeassociated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and exhibited very low or undetectable levels of the nuclear lamin B protein. Of note, p27 Kip1 protein was mostly detected in the cytosolic fraction and not in the nuclear fraction contrary to its expected localization. Significant levels of cyclin E and Cdk2 were also found in the cytosolic fraction ( Figure 7C). Since p27 Kip1 along with cyclins and mitogen-activated protein kinases are proteins whose functions are spatially and temporally regulated and, therefore, are actively transported between the nucleus and cytoplasm, one could speculate that during the fractionation procedure, these proteins easily exit from the nucleus. On the other hand, cathepsin B silencing in CRC cells specifically enhanced p27 Kip1 levels in lysosomeenriched fractions ( Figure 7D).",

Results herein show that cathepsin B promotes anchorage-independent CRC cell growth, which translates in vivo to enhanced tumor growth. In addition, cathepsin B was identified as a new protease capable of proteolytic cleavage of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 . This is especially relevant since the loss of p27 Kip1 expression has been strongly associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical outcome in CRC [22,23].",

            "text": "While many studies have been conducted on cathepsin B expression in CRC [8,[13][14][15][24][25][26], the present study specifically analyzed the expression of this protease at both the mRNA and active protein levels as well as its putative association with mutations in APC or KRAS. Results revealed increased cathepsin B mRNA and protein levels in colorectal tumors, irrespective of tumor stage. These data are reminiscent of the immunohistochemistry data reported by Chan et al. [13] showing that cathepsin B protein was expressed in the vast majority of colon cancers analyzed (558 tumors), which was also independent of tumor stage. The present data also revealed that increased transcription of cathepsin B was associated with the presence of mutations in APC but not in KRAS, thus emphasizing the fact that cathepsin B gene expression is already deregulated in early stages of colorectal carcinoma. Indeed, most CRCs acquire loss-of-function mutations in both copies of the APC gene, resulting in inefficient breakdown of intracellular b-catenin and enhanced nuclear signaling [27]. Given the importance of the Wnt/APC/b-catenin pathway in human tumorigenesis initiation, the present data showing an association between cathepsin B expression and APC mutations are particularly noteworthy. Further studies will be of interest to determine whether this association is correlative or causative. Additional evidence stemming from other studies with APC Min/+ mice nonetheless suggests the contribution of this protease in tumorigenesis with mutated APC. These mice are heterozygous for a germ-line mutation in the mouse homologue of the human APC gene and develop multiple adenomas in the intestine [28]. Cathepsin B was also found to be consistently overexpressed in these adenomatous polyps both at the mRNA and protein levels [12]. In addition, genetic ablation of cathepsin B resulted in suppression of tumor infiltrating pro-inflammatory cells and in attenuation of polyposis in these mice [29]. In a proteomic screening study, cathepsin B was also recently identified as one of the six upregulated proteins in the tumors of APC D580 mice [9]. Such observations again suggest that cathepsin B may be implicated early in the process of tumorigenesis. These results hence support a role for cathepsin B in APC-mutated tumors and lend credence to the possibility of cathepsin B being a therapeutic target for these cancers.",

            "text": "In agreement with other studies that have shown that secretion of cathepsin B is increased in the extracellular environment of several types of cancer cells [7,11,30,31], results obtained herein in CRC cells in culture confirmed the presence of the pro-form of cathepsin B in conditioned culture medium of all CRC cells. However, the catalytically active processed forms of cathepsin B were not detected by Western blot analysis. In keeping with this finding, no cathepsin B enzyme activity was detected in the conditioned medium. This indicates that CRC cells massively secrete pro-cathepsin B but not the active forms of cathepsin B and is consistent with previous studies showing that overexpression of cathepsins is frequently accompanied by the secretion of procathepsins (reviewed in [32]). With regard to CRC, it has been reported that cathepsin B moves from the apical region of the cells to the basal plasma membranes, in parallel with malignant progression to late adenomas and early carcinomas. Prior studies using HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells have shown that trafficking of cathepsin B to caveolae and its subsequent secretion were regulated by active KRAS [7]. Outside of the cells, cathepsin B was moreover ideally positioned to degrade basal membrane components [33,34] or to activate uPA and MMPs [7,35,36], hence promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Since pro-cathepsin B is catalytically inactive, the contribution of secreted cathepsin B to extracellular matrix degradation can, therefore, be questioned. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that extracellular components of the extracellular matrix can facilitate the processing of cathepsins [19,37,38]. Furthermore, under acidic pH conditions, pro-cathepsins are effectively processed into catalytically mature proteases either autocatalytically [39,40] or by other proteases. Accordingly, inhibition of extracellular cathepsin B activity in the present study by the non-permeant inhibitor Ca074 markedly attenuated CRC cell invasion through Matrigel suggesting that secreted pro-cathepsin B was in fact activated under such conditions. Cathepsin B silencing in these same CRC cells also reduced the number of invading cells to a similar extent as that observed with Ca074 in vitro, in addition to inhibiting their metastatic properties in vivo. In keeping with these results, increased serum levels of cathepsin B have been found in patients with CRC [41]. Taken together, these results further support the notion that extracellular cathepsin B may play an important function in CRC invasion and metastasis. Of note, intraperitoneal administration of Ca074 was reported to reduce bone metastasis in a model of breast cancer [42], demonstrating the therapeutic potential of targeting extracellular cathepsin B activity. This metastasis suppression by Ca074 was maintained in a late treatment setting, pointing to a role for this protease in metastatic outgrowth.",

            "text": "An additional finding of this study is the requirement of cathepsin B for anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis. Cathepsin B silencing in CRC cells inhibited their capacity to grow in soft agar and to form tumors in mice. One could speculate that intracellular cathepsin B possibly mediates these functions since Ca074 did not alter growth in soft agar. However, in vivo approaches targeting extracel-lular active cathepsin B are nonetheless needed to clearly confirm such activity. Furthermore, investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of cathepsin B silencing on tumor growth revealed reduced levels of cyclin B1 and increased levels of p27 Kip1 protein in cathepsin Bdeficient tumors. Cyclin B1 is the major controlling cyclin in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle and its expression may reflect the proliferative state of the tumor [43]. p27 Kip1 is a cell cycle regulator which negatively inhibits cyclin-CDK complexes and acts as a key protein in the decision between proliferation and cell cycle exit. As cells progress toward S-phase, transcriptional regulation, translational control, and ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation lead to a decline in p27 Kip1 (reviewed in [44,45]). Moreover, increased proteasome-dependent degradation of p27 Kip1 is particularly observed in aggressive colorectal carcinomas and other cancers [23,46,47]. In keeping with this observation, the absence of p27 Kip1 protein expression is a powerful negative prognostic marker in colorectal carcinomas [22,23,47]. For instance, homozygous p27 Kip1 mutation was consistently found to increase the number of intestinal polyps in Apc mutant mice by five-to sixfold [48]. Herein, cathepsin B was also identified as a novel protease potentially involved in the regulation of p27 Kip1 expression. Results show that, in vitro, this protease was able to specifically cleave the p27 Kip1 protein. The observation that cathepsin B and p27 Kip1 partially colocalized into the lysosomes suggests that some p27 Kip1 cleavage occurred in lysosomes. Supporting this notion, mutations of cathepsin B cleavage sites increased p27 Kip1 protein stability. Accordingly, endolysosomal degradation of p27 Kip1 was also previously demonstrated in Hela and NIH3T3 cells, contributing to the progression of their cell cycle [49]. This particular pathway of p27 degradation appears to be mediated by its interaction with the endosomal protein SNX6, a member of the sorting nexin family of vesicular trafficking regulator [49]. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this SNX6-dependent p27 Kip1 proteolytic pathway remain unknown. The present cell models cultured on a plastic substratum (2D culture) did not allow to consistently detect significant modulation of total p27 Kip1 protein expression following cathepsin B silencing (data not shown). In addition, Western blot analyses of p27 Kip1 expression demonstrated that this cell cycle inhibitory protein was expressed at various levels in CRC cells without any correlation with intracellular cathepsin B expression (Supplementary Figure S1). This suggests that in cultured CRC cells and as previously reported in other cancer cell lines (reviewed in [46]), p27 Kip1 protein expression may be regulated by multiple oncogenic pathways. By contrast, a decrease in p27 Kip1 expression was observed after forced overexpression of cathepsin B in 293 T cells, although p27 Kip1 fragments could not be detected in cell lysates. One could speculate that once generated, these fragments are rapidly degraded in the lysosomes. However, a marked increase in p27 Kip1 protein levels was found in cathepsin B-deficient colorectal tumors derived from mice suggesting that this lysosomal proteolytic pathway is likely to occur in the context of tumorigenesis or 3D CRC cell culture.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that cathepsin B plays a significant role in colorectal tumor development, invasion, and metastasis. Results suggest that intracellular cathepsin B activity controls premalignant processes such as anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation while extracellular cathepsin B regulates invasive properties of CRC cells. p27 Kip1 is furthermore identified as a new molecular target of cathepsin B in CRC cells. Since p27 Kip1 acts as a tumor suppressor, the impairment of its function may increase the tumoral properties of colorectal cells, as shown previously in APC Min/\u00fe mice [48,50]. As such, cathepsin B may, therefore, represent a valuable target for colorectal tumor therapy.",
