            "text": "Background: The benefits of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in patients with hypercapnic COPD are controversial. It is presumed that methodology and appropriate use of NIV ventilator might be crucial for the outcomes. With the new built-in software, the performance of NIV can be monitored at home, which can guarantee the compliance and appropriate use. This study investigated effects of home use of NIV in hypercapnia in COPD patients using the NIV ventilator with built-in software for monitoring. Methods: The current multicenter prospective, randomized, controlled trial enrolled patients with stable GOLD stages III and IV hypercapnic COPD. Patients were randomly assigned via a computer-generated randomization sequence, with a block size of four patients, to continue optimized treatment (control group) or to receive additional NPPV (intervention group) for 3 months. The primary outcome was arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO 2). Data were derived from built-in software and analyzed every 4 weeks. Analysis was carried out with the intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02499718. Results: Patients were recruited from 20 respiratory units in China from October 1, 2015, and recruitment was terminated with a record of the vital statistics on May 31, 2016. A total of 115 patients were randomly assigned to the NPPV group (n=57) or the control group (n=58). Patients complied well with NPPV therapy (mean [\u00b1 standard deviation] day use 5.6\u00b11.4 h). The mean estimation of leaks was 37.99\u00b113.71 L/min. The changes in PaCO 2 (\u221210.41\u00b10.97 vs \u22124.32\u00b10.68 mmHg, P=0.03) and 6-min walk distance (6MWD) (38.2% vs 18.2%, P=0.02) were statistically significant in the NPPV group versus the control group. COPD assessment test (CAT) showed a positive trend (P=0.06) in favor of the NPPV group. Pulmonary function and dyspnea were not different between groups. Conclusion: Ventilators equipped with built-in software provided methodology for monitoring NIV use at home, which could facilitate the improvement of compliance and quality control of NIV use. It was shown that three months use of NIV at home could reduce the PaCO 2 and improve exercise tolerance (6MWD) in chronic hypercapnic COPD patients.",

            "text": "COPD is an increasing important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and leads to a significant economic and social burden. 1,2 Advanced-stage COPD is characterized by irreversible severe flow limitation and chronic hypercapnia. The mechanisms related to chronic hypercapnia in COPD include the imbalance of respiratory impedance and reduced respiratory muscle function. Chronic hypercapnia could result in respiratory acidosis and desensitization of respiratory central drive in response to hypercapnia. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is possible to unload the respiratory muscles, reduce hypercapnia and restore the sensitivity of respiratory center. 3 Physiological studies in literature had shown that NIV could improve ventilation as well as important physiological variables such as lung hyperinflation and blood gases 4 in COPD patients with hypercapnia. Results from several clinical studies showed improvements in survival, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and sleep quality. [5][6][7][8] In addition, NIV use at home might be associated with lower overall treatment costs and fewer hospital admissions. 9 On the other hand, there were also reports showing that NIV provided no additional benefits than long-term oxygen therapy alone in patient's survival rate, hospital admission rate, arterial blood gases and quality of life. The reasons for these controversial results are unclear. Patient selection, methodology and quality control of NIV were supposed to be the main reasons for explanation of discrepancy of different studies results. Respiratory events occur during home NIV, such as asynchrony and leakage, are common and not readily detectable at home use setting. Compliance and ventilator parameters settings are another important factors attributable to the outcomes of NIV. NIV ventilator with built-in software for monitoring and recording can provided the possibility to check the compliance of use and respiratory events during NIV treatment, 10,11 so that clinician can find out and fix the problem.",

In order to estimate the accuracy of built-in software in ventilators, data downloaded from software were compared using the PowerLab system. The finding showed that the estimation of leak and pressure was a low mean bias value between built-in software and PowerLab system. Previous study showed that the rate of abnormalities was 66% and leak was the most common abnormality (34.2%) followed by desaturation dips (23.8%) in home NPPV. 19 In addition, studies have further reported that leak increases ineffective trigger, patient-ventilator asynchrony, and hypoventilation in patients. [20][21][22] In our study, the mean estimation of leak was 37.99 L/min and 87% of the leaks were ,40 L/min, which was greatly lower than the threshold leak influencing the effects of NPPV as reported by previous study, 23 which could ensure the appropriateness of NIV use and reliability of the results. By using built-in software, ventilators, respiratory events were occurring in 12 patients (21%) during NPPV, which were corrected by study staff to ensure the proper use of NPPV. Also, this trial provided evidence that three months use of NPPV at home could improve PaCO 2 and 6MWD in chronic stable COPD with hypercapnia as compared with LTOT alone. Quality of life (CAT scores) was shown to have tendency of improvement, but the improvement did not reach the level of statistical significance (P=0.06) probably due to the small sample size. Additionally, NPPV treatment was not associated with significant improvements in pulmonary function and dyspnea.",

The findings of our study similarly confirmed that NPPV plus LTOT could significantly reduce PaCO 2 than LTOT alone, which may be associated with noninvasive ventilation that could unload respiratory muscles fatigue and reset central respiratory drive. Another important finding was that NPPV significantly improved the exercise endurance of the hypercapnic COPD patients (the mechanisms related to this improvement are not clear and were not studied in this trial). We hypothesized that NIV might be able to improve quality of life if NPPV were used for longer time in a larger population. The minimal clinical improvement in the 6MWD of 54 min 25 was reached in 21 (36.8%) patients in the NPPV group versus 10 (17.2%) Figure 4 Bland-altman plots for absolute reliability of parameters estimation between the Flexo and labChart.

Although we did not observe statistical significance in the scores of SRI and CAT between the two groups, our findings suggested that NPPV tended to improve the quality of life of COPD patients and the negative outcomes could be associated with the short follow-up visit (3 months). Additionally, no significant improvements in pulmonary function were found in the present study at 3 months after intervention, which was in agreement with the results reported in previous studies. 6,24 Nevertheless, the current study presents several limitations. First, the average IPAP was only 17.8 cmH 2 O. In recent years, some researchers stressed the importance of high-intensity noninvasive ventilation. [26][27][28] However, patients included in those studies were European and American who were different from Asian patients. Although the mean pressure was low in the present study, we demonstrated that NPPV also decreased the PaCO 2 and improved the exercise endurance and had a positive trend in improving the quality of life. Second, the follow-up time was short (3 months) in this study. In our future studies, ventilators equipped with built-in software will be used for the evaluation of the longterm effects of NPPV (including the survival, the frequency of acute exacerbation of COPD, and economic evaluation of the cost of COPD) in stable hypercapnic COPD patients.",
