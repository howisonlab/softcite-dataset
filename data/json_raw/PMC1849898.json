            "text": "This study developed a method to boost the expression of recombinant proteins in a cell-free protein synthesis system without leaving additional amino acid residues. It was found that the nucleotide sequences of the signal peptides serve as an efficient downstream box to stimulate protein synthesis when they were fused upstream of the target genes. The extent of stimulation was critically affected by the identity of the second codons of the signal sequences. Moreover, the yield of the synthesized protein was enhanced by as much as 10 times in the presence of an optimal second codon. The signal peptides were in situ cleaved and the target proteins were produced in their native sizes by carrying out the cell-free synthesis reactions in the presence of Triton X-100, most likely through the activation of signal peptidase in the S30 extract. The amplification of the template DNA and the addition of the signal sequences were accomplished by PCR. Hence, elevated levels of recombinant proteins were generated within several hours.",

While the conventional protocols of cell-free protein synthesis have been unable to provide sufficient quantities of proteins, recent improvements in the understanding of the key factors involved in cell-free synthesis have allowed the development of more efficient and robust protocols. Among the many attempts to enhance the accumulation of protein products in cell-free synthesis reactions, major improvements have been made through the stable supply of energy and substrates; ATP and amino acids (5)(6)(7)(8). Kim et al. reported that the stable maintenance of the magnesium concentration against accumulating phosphate is also essential for prolonging the reaction period of cell-free protein synthesis (9).",

For example, in reactions utilizing creatine phosphate for the continuous regeneration of ATP, the use of an excess amount of creatine phosphate enabled prolonged protein synthesis provided that the reaction mixture was supplied periodically with fresh magnesium ions to compensate for their loss through the formation of insoluble magnesium phosphates. Using this approach, as much as 1.2 mg/ml of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) could be produced from a single batch reaction of cell-free protein synthesis. An increase in the productivity of many other proteins was also shown after improving the supply of ATP and amino acids (9). However, the provision of optimal biochemical conditions does not always enhance the productivity of cell-free protein synthesis. For example, the expression level of hEPO was not affected significantly in the presence of the elevated levels of ATP and amino acids, and remained at <100 mg/ml. Since all of our ORFs were routinely cloned in the same expression vectors (pK7 and pIVEX2.3d) (9,18), such a discrepancy would be due to the nature of the nucleotide sequences of the structural genes.",

For example, Stenstr\u00f6m and Isaksson recently demonstrated that the translational efficiency of the lacZ reporter gene was critically affected by the identity of the first +2 to +5 codons (13). In particular, the expression level was dramatically changed according to which codon was placed at the +2 position. While the expression level of the reporter gene was strongly stimulated when the AAA codon was located at +2 position (11), the placement of the NGG codons (CGG, AGG, GGG and UGG) at the same position was associated with remarkably lower expression efficiency (12,20).",

Instead of cloning each of the fusion constructs in the expression vector, the PCR-amplified DNA with or without the ompAss were used directly as the templates for cell-free protein synthesis, thereby eliminating the time-and labor-intensive cloning steps (Figure 4). As summarized in Table 4, the presence of ompAss remarkably enhanced the expression of the target proteins in all the cases examined, which suggests that the proposed strategy  can be employed as a general method for boosting the expression of the recombinant proteins in a cell-free protein synthesis system. However, the extent of stimulation showed significant variations among different proteins implying that the expression of protein can also be substantially affected by the nucleotide sequences of the target ORFs.",

Therefore, it would be desirable if the signal peptides are removed during protein synthesis so that the resulting polypeptide of the target protein follows its natural folding pathway. Since the reactions of cell-free protein synthesis are carried out in a crude lysate of E.coli (S30 extract), it was presumed that most of the soluble E.coli proteins are present in the reaction mixture. In addition, the signal peptidase of E.coli retains its activity even when it is detached from the cellular membrane (22,23). Therefore, the added signal peptide should be removed in situ by the endogenous signal peptidase activity. As shown in Figure 5A, SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses confirmed that a significant proportion of the cell-free  expressed protein had the native size without the signal peptide. This indicates that the S30 extract retains the signal peptidase activity under the reaction conditions for cell-free protein synthesis. Tschantz et al. reported that the catalytic activity of truncated E.coli signal peptidase, which lacks the membrane-anchoring domain, was stimulated in the presence of the detergent Triton X-100 (22,24). By taking advantage of the 'open' nature of cell-free protein synthesis, an attempt was made to express the ompAss-hEPO construct in the presence of Triton X-100 with the anticipation that the enhanced signal peptidase activity would increase the fraction of the correctly sized product. Indeed, the efficiency of the cleavage of signal peptide was improved remarkably upon the addition of Triton X-100, and virtually all the products were found at the correct molecular weight ( Figure 5A). When tested at different concentrations, the presence of Triton X-100 >0.1% (w/v) effectively facilitated the removal of the OmpA sequence, and virtually all of the cell-free expressed products were found at the native size of EPO. At least up to the concentration of 0.5% (w/v), the presence of Triton X-100 did not affect the efficiency of protein synthesis ( Figure 5B). Therefore, enhanced efficiency of the cleavage of the signal sequence was not due to a reduced yield of protein synthesis. In addition, solubility of the cell-free expressed products was substantially enhanced in the presence of Triton X-100. While the EPO molecules (regardless of the presence of signal sequences) were almost completely insoluble in the reaction mixture without any detergents, 70% of the expressed protein was found in the soluble fraction.",

First, overlap extension PCR techniques were used to amplify the target genes in the fused form with the nucleotide sequence of signal peptide. The amplified DNA was then used to direct protein synthesis, and protein molecules were generated within several hours. In addition, by mimicking the in vivo process of the signal peptide cleavage, the target proteins were produced in their native amino acid sequences without additional signal peptides. Although the detailed mechanism of the signal sequencemediated stimulation of protein synthesis is not completely understood, it appears that the effect of the initial nucleotide sequences is not related to the relative abundance or stability of the mRNA species. Computational analyses of the mRNA structure did not indicate any notable difference caused by the presence of these signal sequences. In addition, among the gene constructs examined in this study, the relative level of mRNA with or without the signal sequence was similar (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that the initial nucleotide sequence affects the process of translation initiation and/or the early phase of elongation (12,20,25). In particular, Gonzalez de Valdivia and Isaksson demonstrated that the presence of NGG triplets in the early coding region causes inefficient translation through an accelerated drop-off of peptidyl-tRNA (12,20).",

            "text": "Although extensive evidence has been presented that entire codon context in the early coding region (from positions +2 to +5) influence gene expression, the presence of additional AAA triplet at the positions +3 to +5 of ompTss did not further increase the yield of protein synthesis in our experiments (data not shown). However, still, it might be of worth to note that some of the effective signal sequences have additional AAA triplet in the early coding region (e.g. malEss and ompCss have an additional AAA triplet at +4 position). It might be possible to further improve the effectiveness of the signal sequences by engineering the nucleotide sequences in this region. Apart from the precise mechanism of action, the use of signal sequences as a translation-enhancing downstream box offers distinctive advantages in cell-free protein synthesis. In addition to the remarkably enhanced expression level of the target proteins, the in situ cleavage of the signal peptides provides a simple way for removing the N-terminal methionine. The issue of removing the translation initiator, N-formyl-methionine or methionine, from a recombinant protein is often critical for obtaining active and stable recombinant proteins (26)(27)(28)(29)(30).",

Using the signal sequences that have been engineered to stimulate protein synthesis at different efficiencies, a mixture of template DNA can be co-expressed to generate the proteins in the desired abundances. Such a system will provide an ideal platform for constructing an in vitro metabolic network. As demonstrated by Ku et al.
