[1,2] Coronary bifurcation lesions are one of the most challenging subsets in interventional cardiology, and the treatment is still the subject of substantial debate. Several randomized clinical trials have recommended a provisional technique of stenting as the routine bifurcation stenting technique. [3-6] However, side branch (SB) occlusion after main vessel (MV) stenting is a serious procedural complication for the provisional approach. Previous studies have reported that the reference vessel diameter (RVD) of the SB and the prevalence of a stenosis at SB ostium were independent predictors of SB occlusion, [7-9] but numerous factors such as clinical and angiographic characteristics could impact the risk of SB occlusion. Accordingly, this study was designed to characterize the incidence and predictors of major SB occlusion during coronary bifurcation intervention in a cohort of consecutive patients who underwent PCI in a single center for cardiovascular disease. Methods Study population All the patients enrolled in our study population were patients with coronary bifurcation lesions, which were defined as a coronary artery narrowing occurring adjacent to or involving the origin of a significant SB. [10] From January 2012 to July 2012, a cohort of 7007 consecutive patients with 9421 lesions underwent PCI at Fuwai Hospital in Beijing, China. In our study, inclusion criteria were: (1) Patients with coronary bifurcation lesions undergoing PCI; and (2) the bifurcation"

Among the 7007 patients, 5172 patients without bifurcation lesions and 290 patients with bifurcation lesions undergoing elective SB stenting were excluded. 908 coronary bifurcation patients with SB baseline reference diameter <2.0mm were also excluded. Finally, 637 patients with 652 bifurcation lesions which met all the inclusion criteria and had no exclusion criteria were included in this study [ Figure 1]. Primary endpoint of the study was SB occlusion, which was defined as no blood flow or any thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade decrease in SB after MV stenting. The Ethics Committee of the Cardiovascular Institute and Fuwai Hospital approved this study.",

We obtained quantitative angiographic measurements of the four segments of the bifurcation lesion: The proximal MV segment, the distal MV segment, the SB segment and the bifurcation core segment [ Figure 2]. Bifurcation core is defined as the central part of the bifurcation which begins where the common vessel starts to split into two branches and ends at the carinal point, [14] which area was calculated by the Qangio XA software. We also obtained the bifurcation angle (the angle between the distal MV and the SB) from the analysis system.",

Provisional technique of stenting has been found to be noninferior to elective double stenting with respect to clinical outcome in 5-year follow-up. [15] However, abrupt closure of the SB may occur after MV stent implantation. The complication of SB occlusion in complex bifurcation lesions   limits the utilization of provisional stenting. Identifying the predictors of SB occlusion could help to select the optimal intervention strategy during coronary bifurcation PCI. Although previous studies have reported that the RVD of the SB and the SB ostial stenosis are independent predictors of SB occlusion, [7,8] SB occlusions are determined by many factors including the clinical and angiographic characteristics. Accordingly, our study sought to characterize the predictors of SB occlusion during coronary bifurcation intervention in a cohort of consecutive patients who underwent PCI in a large single center for cardiovascular disease. The major findings of this study are that: (1) Angiography characteristics like diameter stenosis of SB before MV stenting, TIMI flow grade of SB before MV stenting and bifurcation angle are independent predictors of SB occlusion; (2) Innovative parameter in this study \"diameter ratio between MV/SB\" is an important predictor of SB occlusion;",

Both diameter stenosis of SB at baseline and diameter stenosis of SB before MV stenting were enrolled in the present study and only diameter stenosis of SB before MV stenting was selected as an independent predictor. Arteries with lower TIMI flow grade are more likely to have thrombus or other complex lesion features, and, therefore, are more likely to have SB occlusion. Previous study has reported that preprocedural TIMI Grade 2 flow in SB was a predictive factor for SB occlusion. [19] In our study, TIMI flow grade of SB before MV stenting was found to be an independent predictor of SB occlusion after MV stenting. We also found that the risk of SB occlusion increased as the ratio of the diameter between MV/SB increased, which is concordant with the results of previous studies.

            "text": "The effect of bifurcation angle on the rate of SB occlusion during PCI is controversial. Previous studies have reported that smaller angle in coronary bifurcations predicted higher SB compromise, restenosis, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) rates based on small sample size. [20] However, Yoshitaka Goto et al. reported that bifurcation angle was not associated with SB compromise after MV stenting. [24] On the other hand, Dzavik et al. found that bifurcation angle >50\u00b0 is an independent predictor of MACE after bifurcation crush stenting. [25] In our study, a wide bifurcation angle predicted SB occlusion after MV stenting. Part of the explanation was that bifurcations with smaller bifurcation angle was easier for flow diversion into SB and too large bifurcation angle might increase the pressure drop and flow resistance, [26] thus increasing the SB occlusion risk.",

After univariate analysis, jailed wire in SB and predilatation of SB were employed in the multivariate model; however, none of them was selected as an independent risk factor for SB occlusion. The results of the present study was consistent with previous studies [18] and differences in technique were not independent predictors of SB occlusion. Although jailed wire in SB and other procedural factors may affect the SB occlusion and SB flow recovery, none of these factors were selected as independent predictors of SB occlusion in the present study. Acute coronary syndrome has reported to be an independent predictor of SB occlusion, [18] nevertheless, there is no significant difference in unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 1 month or emergency PCI between the two groups in the present study. Other factors which may be considered as predictors of SB occlusion like thrombus burden and lesion length of SB were also not selected as independent predictors of SB occlusion. Additional prospective clinical studies may further help to clarify these questions.",

Smaller RVD was an independent predictor of SB occlusion reported in the previous study, [9] and the rate of SB occlusion do increase as the RVD of SB become smaller.

For these relative small SBs with high occlusion risk, jailed-balloon technique is recommended in consideration of that jailed-balloon technique was associated with a high procedural success rate, lower rates of SB loss and MACE at late follow-up.

Second, selection of treatment strategies, stent types, and other instruments were at the discretion of operators. Our findings are subject to selection bias and compounded with unmeasured variables.
