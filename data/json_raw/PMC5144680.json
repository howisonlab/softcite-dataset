            "text": "There is growing recognition that small open reading frames (sORFs) encoding peptides shorter than 100 amino acids are an important class of functional elements in the eukaryotic genome, with several already identified to play critical roles in growth, development, and disease. However, our understanding of their biological importance has been hindered owing to the significant technical challenges limiting their annotation. Here we combined ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNAs with rigorous conservation analysis to identify a comprehensive population of translated sORFs during early Drosophila embryogenesis. In total, we identify 399 sORFs, including those previously annotated but without evidence of translational capacity, those found within transcripts previously classified as non-coding, and those not previously known to be transcribed. Further, we find, for the first time, evidence for translation of many sORFs with different isoforms, suggesting their regulation is as complex as longer ORFs. Furthermore, many sORFs are found not associated with ribosomes in late-stage Drosophila S2 cells, suggesting that many of the translated sORFs may have stage-specific functions during embryogenesis. These results thus provide the first comprehensive annotation of the sORFs present during early Drosophila embryogenesis, a necessary basis for a detailed delineation of their function in embryogenesis and other biological processes.",

            "text": "Now that the genomes of many organisms have been sequenced, their comprehensive annotation is required to fully understand the functional elements that are encoded therein. [1][2][3] Although the focus of much of this annotation is of longer open reading frames (ORFs), there is growing appreciation that the much less studied small ORFs (sORFs), historically defined as <100 amino acids (aa) in length, may prove to be as widely significant in many biological processes as the larger class. [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] For example, the tarsal-less (tal) gene in Drosophila, which was previously thought to be a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), has been found to contain four conserved sORFs encoding three 11-aa and one 32-aa peptides, that are required for embryonic tracheal development and leg morphogenesis. 5,13,17 Similarly, a conserved 56-aa peptide encoded by the Toddler gene in zebrafish has been found to function as a mitogen to promote cell migration during gastrulation. 18 However, what has primarily hindered our appreciation of the extent to which the sORFs are biologically significant is, in fact, their reliable identification, the necessary first step before any detailed functional characterization. 19,20 In general, strictly bioinformatic approaches require a large number of experimentally validated ORFs to serve as a training set to enable subsequent de novo prediction, but there are presently not a sufficient number of identified sORFs for this purpose. Alternatively, ORFs can be identified based on conservation alone, but for that, reliable prediction generally requires sequences that encode peptides that are longer than 100-aa. [21][22][23][24][25][26] Direct identification of translated peptides in the cell by proteomic methods is also often highly effective, however these methods are well known to be inefficient at detecting proteins of small size. 10,27,28 Thus, it is highly likely that many sORFs have been misclassified as lncRNAs or missed entirely from present annotation.",

[29][30][31][32] Yet, while this work suggests that there may be thousands of sORFs translated in these organisms, there is presently a lack of experimental translational verification for the majority of the predictions. Perhaps the most successful experimental method to identify sORFs so far has been deep sequencing of ribosome-associated RNA. 10,[31][32][33] However, recent work has suggested that ribosome occupancy alone is insufficient to unequivocally conclude that a potential sORF is indeed translated. 34,35 Instead, combining deep sequencing of ribosome-associated RNAs with bioinformatics analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to identify translated sORFs, genome-wide. [34][35][36][37] Of the few well characterized sORFs, a surprisingly large fraction, like tal and Toddler mentioned above, has been found to play vital roles during development. 14,[16][17][18]38,39 We thus speculated that there might be a large number of presently unannotated sORFs that perform critical functions during development, and that identifying the complete repertoire of translated sORFs during embryogenesis would prove both a useful strategy to identify a large set of sORFs to aid de novo sORF prediction as well as a necessary resource to understand this fundamental biological process.",

Of these, 128 were previously predicted sORFs but lacked experimental support, 22 are located in transcripts previously classified as lncRNAs, and 45 are novel sORFs found on transcripts not previously known to be transcribed. Further, among the sORFs that were previously annotated, we provide the first evidence of translation for sORFs with multiple isoforms. We tested the translational capability of randomly selected sORFs identified here in Drosophila S2R\u00fe cell lines using an eGFPtagged transfection assay, and found that most (22 out of 23) were highly translated, attesting to the validity of our combined experimental and bioinformatics approach. Thus, with this work, we provide the first comprehensive annotation of sORFs during early Drosophila embryogenesis, which we anticipate will aid our understanding of early development as well as the functions of sORFs in biological processes in general.",

Absorbance in each layer of the sucrose density gradient was measured at an optical density of 254 nm using the Piston Gradient Fractionater (BioComp). The RNA components and the amount of ribosomes were determined based on distinct peaks in the polysome profiling. Ribosome material was collected by pooling both the 80S (monosome) and the polysome peaks identified in the profile.

We then used the PhyloCSF package to evaluate the coding potential of ORFs contained in ribosome-associated lncRNAs and novel transcripts with parameters '12flies -orf \u00bc ATGStop -frames \u00bc 3 -minCodons \u00bc 10', which was intended to find all ORFs longer than 10-aa in frame. To avoid any influence of annotated ORFs, we excluded the ORFs which overlapped with annotated ORFs in the same or opposite strand. The multi-alignment file of 12 flies species were downloaded from the Galaxy cloud tool. [47][48][49] ",

To verify the identity of this ribosome material, prior to the sucrose gradient separation, we treated the embryo extract with 50 mM EDTA, which is known to dissociate intact ribosomes into their constituent subunits. 51,52 As expected, this treatment completely eliminated the peaks of the intact ribosomes in the profile, while the peaks associated with the 40S and 60S subunits increased significantly (Fig. 1C). For our analysis, we collected not only polysomes as is typical with this approach but also monosomes as well, with which some short transcripts are only associated. 53,54 Further, we purified only the poly-adenylated RNAs from this ribosome material, since nonpoly-adenylated RNAs, a large proportion of the transcriptome, do not likely contain translated ORFs. 55 The ribosome-associated polyadenylated RNAs were converted into cDNA libraries for strandspecific, paired-end 100 base-pair (bp) sequencing with HiSeq 2000.",

Of the 332 different sORFs (corresponding to 313 genes), there were 17 genes with two different sORFs and 1 gene with three different sORFs. In addition, there were 177 genes with more than one annotated isoforms and 86 genes with variant isoforms not previously described. This is, in fact, the first detection of variant isoforms of translated sORFs. For example, with the gene CG40228, we found five isoforms with (in total) 3 different sORFs, including a variant isoform not previously characterized with a unique 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) that is 19 bp upstream of all other isoforms. Variant isoforms in longer ORFs are usually associated with their highly regulated, differential translation, 59,60 and so this observation of variant sORF isoforms suggests that the translational processing of the sORFs may be as complex as that governing their longer counterpart. Ribosome profiling might prove useful in this regard, since a recent study employing this method thoroughly characterized stop codon readthrough in many genes in early Drosophila embryos. 61 ",

We thus evaluated the degree to which these lncRNAs and the protein-coding genes are associated with ribosomes compared with their total level of expression (their 'ribosome association efficiency'). We found that, although these ribosome-associated lncRNAs are expressed at a much lower level than the protein-coding genes (Wilcoxon test, P-value < 2.2e-16) (Fig. 3A), their ribosome association efficiency is not significantly different from that of the protein-coding genes (Wilcoxon test, P-value > 0.05) (Fig. 3B).

In particular, we first identified ORFs with an ATG start codon and an in-frame stop codon, using the longest ORF for each stop codon. We then discarded those ORFs that encode for peptides smaller than 10-aa or that overlapped annotated ORFs in the same or opposite strand. In this way, we identified 1,784 putative sORFs (median length of 20-aa) and 9 potential long-ORFs in 347 out of the 349 ribosome-associated lncRNAs (Fig. 3C). As a stricter criterion, we examined the conservation at the aminoacid level of these putative sORFs using PhyloCSF, which has been demonstrated to be a highly effective method to identify sORFs. 69,70 Using annotated sORFs and lincRNAs to establish rigorous threshold values in this approach (see 'Materials and methods' section), we identified 28 ORFs located in 21 ribosome-associated lncRNA genes as conserved translated ORFs. Of these, 22 are sORFs ( Supplementary Table S2), including 3 that are poly-cistronic like tal and scl. 5,16,17 We note that among these 22 novel sORFs, 64% are not found in the late-stage Drosophila S2 cell line, and thus may be specific for early embryos. The finding of a fair number of ribosomeassociated lncRNAs that lack coding potential is intriguing and remains to be resolved. Based on the current understanding, one might speculate that they may play roles in RNA localization, RNA nonsense mediated decay, translational regulation, or they may produce non-canonical proteins that are quickly degraded. [71][72][73] Alternatively, these lncRNAs may encode proteins with non-AUG start codons. 74,75 . However, one should also not exclude the possibility that a further analysis would yield functions that are not yet known.",

Similar to the ribosomeassociated lncRNAs, we found that these ribosome-associated novel transcripts are as tightly associated to the ribosomes as the proteincoding genes (Wilcoxon test, P-value > 0.05) (Fig. 3B), although their expression level is much lower than those known to encode for peptides (Wilcoxon test, P-value \u00bc 3.638e-12) (Fig. 3A). Examining these transcripts for potential ORFs similarly to the lncRNAs described above, we identified 2,521 putative ORFs, most of which (98.5%) were sORFs (median length of 24-aa) (Fig. 3C). Analysing these putative ORFs in terms of their conservation using PhyloCSF, we identified 66 different conserved translated ORFs contained within 32 of these novel transcripts ( Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 45 are sORFs, most (87%) of which were present only in the early embryos and not in the S2 cell line. The well-studied Drosophila genes, tal and scl which were previously thought to be lincRNAs but then shown to encode functional sORFs, are well-resolved in our ribosome-associated RNA data.

We generated eGFP-fusion vectors that contained all of the translation-related elements of the sORF, including the 5 0 UTR and 3 0 UTR, together with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) coding sequence (CDS) in-frame following the sORF (Fig. 4B). Thus, translation of this eGFP-tagged sORF would produce an eGFP-fusion protein, for which we examined using Western blotting and fluorescence microscopy. Overall, we found that 22 of the 23 candidates were well translated ( Fig. 4C-E and Supplementary Fig. S6). Of these, 3 were clearly localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm as observed with eGFP control ( Supplementary Fig. S6), while the other 19 were mainly localized in cytoplasm (Fig. 4C-E and Supplementary Fig. S6). Of note though, the cytoplasmic localization did not appear to be the same for all of the fusions, with some enriched in a single, large subsection Figure 3.

(B) Despite their lower ribosome occupation, the ribosome association efficiency of the lncRNAs and novel transcripts was not significantly different from that of the protein-coding RNAs (all P-values > 0.05 relative to the protein coding RNA). Here, the ribosome association efficiency is defined as the ratio of the abundance of the ribosome-associated RNA to the total RNA.
