            "text": "Background: Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine have demonstrated a survival benefit over gemcitabine alone in advanced pancreatic cancer (PDA). This study aimed to investigate the clinical, biological, and imaging effects of the regimen in patients with operable PDA. Methods: Patients with operable PDA received two cycles of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine before surgical resection. FDG-PET and CA19.9 tumour marker levels were used to measure clinical activity. Effects on tumour stroma were determined by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) elastography. The collagen content and architecture as well as density of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were determined in the resected surgical specimen and compared with a group of untreated and treated with conventional chemoradiation therapy controls. A co-clinical study in a mouse model of PDA was conducted to differentiate between the effects of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Results: A total of 16 patients were enrolled. Treatment resulted in significant antitumour effects with 50% of patients achieving a 475% decrease in circulating CA19.9 tumour marker and a response by FDG-PET. There was also a significant decrement in tumour stiffness as measured by EUS elastography. Seven of 12 patients who completed treatment and were operated had major pathological regressions. Analysis of residual tumours showed a marked disorganised collagen with a very low density of CAF, which was not observed in the untreated or conventionally treated control groups. The preclinical co-clinical study showed that these effects were specific of nab-paclitaxel and not gemcitabine. Conclusion: These data suggest that nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine decreases CAF content inducing a marked alteration in cancer stroma that results in tumour softening. This regimen should be studied in patients with operable PDA.",

            "text": "The outcome of patients with PDA remains poor (Hidalgo, 2010). One important characteristic of this disease is the formation of a rich stromal reaction that accompanies the malignant transformed epithelium (Mahadevan and Von Hoff, 2007). The stroma is composed of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, hyaluronic acid, and SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) and cellular elements such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), endothelial, immune, and inflammatory cells (Mahadevan and Von Hoff, 2007). The stroma in PDA contributes to poor vascularisation and high intratumoural pressure that decreases drug diffusion (Von Hoff et al, 2009). There is an increasing interest in targeting different components of the cancer stroma in PDA and several preclinical studies using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of PDA show promising results (Olive et al, 2009;Provenzano et al, 2012;Jacobetz et al, 2013). The elimination of the cancer stroma leads to decrease intratumour pressure, heighted vascularisation, and improved drug delivery.",

            "text": "One interesting stromal target of PDA is SPARC, which is overexpressed in PDA (Infante et al, 2007). Although the functions of this protein are not fully understood, it is implicated in stromal formation and trafficking, invasion and metastasis, and has been linked to a worse prognosis (Infante et al, 2007;Arnold et al, 2010). SPARC binds albumin leading to the hypothesis that it may facilitate the delivery to the tumour of albumin-bound therapeutics. A phase 2 clinical trial of nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced PDA showed significant antitumour activity with an objective response rate of 48%, median survival of 12.2 months, and 1-year survival of 48% (Von Hoff et al, 2011). A recently reported phase 3 study has shown improvement in survival with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, as compared with gemcitabine in patients with advanced PDA. In a parallel preclinical study using patient-derived xenograft models of PDA, we showed that exposure to nab-paclitaxel collapsed the PDA stroma increasing the intratumour concentration of gemcitabine by approximately three-fold (Von Hoff et al, 2011). A subsequent study in GEMM of PDA indicated that nabpaclitaxel increases the intratumour concentration of gemcitabine by inactivation of the cytidine deaminase, an enzyme involved in the catabolism of gemcitabine (Frese et al, 2012).",

Before study entry, patients were studied with a complete medical history and physical exam; complete blood counts and serum chemistry; CA19.9 tumour marker; high-resolution CT scan of the abdomen, FDG-PET scan; and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) elastography. Treatment consisted of nab-paclitaxel 125 mg m -2 followed by gemcitabine 1000 mg m -2 administered on days 1, 8, and 15, every 28 days for two cycles. Treatment-related toxicities were evaluated by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events version 3.0. A CT scan, FDG-PET, elastography, and CA19.9 were used to determine tumour response after two cycles of treatment. Objective tumour responses were evaluated according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria (Eisenhauer et al, 2009). EUS elastography was performed with the linear Pentax EUS (Montvale, NJ, USA) and the Hitachi EUB900 equipment (Tokyo, Japan). Representative areas of the tumour and surrounding normal tissues were selected for analysis. The results of the elastography evaluation was defined by the quotient strain ratio between the normal and tumour regions as previously described (Iglesias-Garcia et al, 2010). Patients with stable or responding tumours were schedule for surgical resection 6-8 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose. The degree of tumour regression in the surgical specimen was determined adapting the Ryan's classification utilised in rectal cancer including four categories: GRT-0, complete response; GRT-1, important partial response with only single cells or isolated cell groups left; GRT-2, partial response but large residual tumour, and GRT-3 low or no response and large residual cancer (Ryan et al, 2005). R1 resection was considered if there were tumour cells present p1 mm of the resection margin. Postoperative treatment consisted in four cycles of standard dose of gemcitabine.",

Collagen analysis was assessed using collagen I primary rabbit antibody (1 : 100; Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, USA) for 1 h at 37 1C and as secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Activated fibroblasts were determined with double staining using vimentin, as total fibroblasts marker (1 : 50; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) as an activated fibroblast marker (1 : 100; DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen) for vimentin and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen) for SMA. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen) and mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope TCS-SP5 (AOBS) Leica (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with two magnifications \u00c2 20 HCX PL APO CS (0.7 NA) and \u00c2 40 HCX PL APO CS (1.25 NA) oil immersion objectives. Acquisition Software was LAS AF v.2.4.1 (Leica Microsystems). Fibroblast quantification was performed with Definiens Developer XD Software (Munich, Germany). Detected cells were classified depending on the ratio between mean layer intensities of both, vimentin and SMA. Activated fibroblasts were considered when they co-expressed SMA and vimentin. We determined the fibroblast density index by adjusting the number of cells counted to the proportion of tumour fibrosis observed in the specimen (adapted from Erkan et al, 2008). The quantification was done in two different and representative fields (20 steps) for each sample. In the preclinical study, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against mouse SPARC (R&D Systems, MAB942, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9661).",

A total of 16 patients, whose principal characteristics are listed in Table 1, received two cycles of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine before surgical resection using the previously published dose and schedule (Von Hoff et al, 2011). Three patients developed disease progression during the preoperative treatment and were not resected. One additional patient with potentially resectable cancer was not operated because of high surgical risk. A total of 12 patients underwent surgery. Overall treatment was well tolerated with side effects in the range of what has been previously reported. Figure 1 shows the results of the main clinical parameters studied. The mean CA19.9 level decreased from 2588 U dl -1 pretreatment to 1056 U dl -1 post-treatment (P \u00bc 0.001) with 50% of patients having a 475% reduction. Similarly, the max standardised uptake value (SUV) of FDG decreased from a mean of 7.2 (range, 2.98-13.4) before treatment to 4.5 (range, 1.9-9) after treatment (P \u00bc 0.005), including eight (50%) of the patients with a partial metabolic response by FDG-PET ( Supplementary Figure 1 shows a representative case). There was a statistically significant correlation between improvement in CA19.9 tumour marker and FDG PET response (P \u00bc 0.05). However, no objective responses were observed. We also determined tumour stiffness by elastography. The ratio value, a measurement of tumour stiffness, diminished from a value 36 pre-treatment to 18 post-treatment (P \u00bc 0.002). These data suggest that tumours became softener after treatment. There was a statistically significant correlation between changes from baseline in elastography ratio and CA19.9 response (P \u00bc 0.019).",

Of interest, and in agreement with the tissue-based analysis discussed below, we did not observe objective responses by RECIST. However, the majority of patients showed improvement in SUV uptake by FDG-PET and elastography ratio. This discrepancy between morphological and functional imaging is consistent with the tissue results and suggest that as a tumour respond to treatment there is a replacement of actively growing glucose consuming cells to an oligocellular, quiescent stroma. The lack of concordance between RECIST, metabolic, and pathological responses points to the need to incorporate other measurements of efficacy in preoperative studies in PDA. Three patients, however, develop rapid disease progression indicating that there is a group of patients who progress rapidly to nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.

In our prior studies in patient-derived xenograft mouse models treated for short period of time, we observed an almost complete elimination of cancer stroma (Von Hoff et al, 2011). These results, however, were not reproduced in studies using GEMM of PDA (Frese et al, 2012). Here we show, in patient samples, that the effect is predominantly stromal remodelling with marked alteration of collagen architecture and elimination of CAF. This is best reflected by changes in CAF density and appears to be different from patients treated with conventional chemoradiation. Similar observations were made in GEMM of PDA driven by distinct engineered genetic changes as the models tested before: the most striking observation was the increase collagen and CAF in the gemcitabine only treated group. The reasons for these differences across models and patients are not known. Duration of treatment can be a factor as mice studies are conducted with short, 5-21 days, exposure while in human studies the treatment duration is 8 weeks allowing time for some of the tissue remodelling effects to occur. Another factor is differences between models. Human-derived xenografts models form less stroma of murine origin and have abnormal tumour vascularisation, particularly in subcutaneous implanted tumours. In contrast, the KPC GEMM model used in prior studies forms abundant and exuberant stroma (Olive et al, 2009). The GEMM model used in these studies, carrying different engineered genetic changes, has an intermediate stromal content not as manifested as the KPC model. There are, however, limitations to this work that need to be taken into account when considering the implications of these data.",

Indeed, the content of stroma and CAF may change with different cancer stages. Another limitation is that the study does not include a pre-and posttreatment tissue biopsy to determine tissue changes but rather an untreated control. Finally, there is no randomised control arm treated with gemcitabine alone that would make the comparison more conclusive.",

            "text": "In summary, this clinical study shows that nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine exerts significant antitumour activity in primary PDA as seen by the high rate of responses by different imaging methods and tumour marker studies that led to marginfree resection in 92% of patients and pathological responses in 70% of cases. Although the number of patients is small, the results are striking enough to warrant additional studies in this setting. At the tissue level, the most interesting observation of the study is that, in marked contrast with tumour exposed preoperatively to conventional chemoradiation, tumours treated with nab-paclitaxel contained less abundant CAFs, a clearly altered collagen, and had became softer as determined by elastography. Parallel mouse studies indicate that the main effects are due to nab-paclitaxel and not gemcitabine. Based on these data, this approach should be tested in a larger randomise trial to determine the clinical impact of tumour down staging before surgery and the long-term impact of pathological tumour regression. In addition, EUS elastography appears an attractive method to monitor stromal changes with treatment.   . Panel (B) shows the effects of treatment in CAF stained for aSMA (red) and vimentin (green) immunofluorescence for quantification of activated and total fibroblast in samples of mice treated with the indicated agents ( \u00c2 40, scale bar \u00bc 50 mM). Panel (C) shows a quantification of total and activated CAFs in untreated tumours and tumours treated with gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel and the combination in two (20 steps) \u00c2 40 HCX PL APO CS (1.25 NA) oil immersion objectives high-power fields. Statistical analysis was not significant because of heterogeneity of samples.",
