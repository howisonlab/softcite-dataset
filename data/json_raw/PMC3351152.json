            "text": "Defects of the translation apparatus in human mitochondria are known to cause disease, yet details of how protein synthesis is regulated in this organelle remain to be unveiled. Here, we characterize a novel human protein, C7orf30 that contributes critically to mitochondrial translation and specifically associates with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mt-LSU). Inactivation of C7orf30 in human cells by RNA interference results in respiratory incompetence owing to reduced mitochondrial translation rates without any appreciable effects on the steady-state levels of mitochondrial mRNAs and rRNAs. Ineffective translation in C7orf30-depleted cells or cells overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of the protein results from aberrant assembly of mt-LSU and consequently reduced formation of the monosome. These findings lead us to propose that C7orf30 is a human assembly and/or stability factor involved in the biogenesis of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome."

            "text": "It is estimated that 3-5% of all human proteins are localized to mitochondria (1), vital organelles that supply energy to the cell through the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Approximately 90 proteins form the five enzyme complexes that perform OXPHOS and 13 of those are encoded in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). For this reason, mitochondria contain a separate translation apparatus, necessary for the synthesis of the mtDNA-encoded polypeptides of the OXPHOS system. The RNA components (2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs) of the mitochondrial translation machinery are encoded by mtDNA, while all protein components including the mitochondrial ribosomal subunits, translation factors, tRNA synthetases, tRNA-modifying enzymes, and other auxiliary factors are encoded by nuclear genes and imported to mitochondria from the cytosol. Human mitoribosomes consist of a large (mt-LSU) and small subunit (mt-SSU) of 39S and 28S, respectively, and the entire ribosome has a sedimentation coefficient of 55S (2).",

            "text": "Many genetic defects can lead to perturbations of the OXPHOS system and result in multi-system, often fatal, human diseases. These genetic defects can be located within nuclear DNA (nDNA) or mtDNA. Isolated OXPHOS deficiencies, that affect a specific biochemical activity of the OXPHOS system, are usually caused by mutations in structural genes (coding for a specific component of the OXPHOS machinery) or in genes encoding proteins responsible for the assembly of a particular respiratory complex. In contrast, inherited pathological mutations, affecting either mitochondrially or nuclearly encoded components of the mitochondrial translation machinery, are associated with combined OXPHOS deficiencies affecting multiple enzymes involved in cellular respiration. Many mutations in mtDNA-encoded genes for the RNA components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus (mt-rRNAs and mt-tRNAs) have been identified, and detection of yet uncharacterized mutations is relatively straightforward. On the contrary, a group of mutations in nuclear gene products involved in mitochondrial translation linked to human disease has emerged only in recent years (3). This group currently contains <20 genes including those that encode: translation elongation factors, proteins of the mitoribosomal subunits, several tRNA synthetases, tRNA-modifying enzymes [for recent review see (4)] and also other translation auxiliary proteins, such as TACO1 (CCDC44) (5) or c12orf65 (6). Given the complexity of the mitochondrial translation system, this list is unlikely to be complete. By analogy to other translation systems one would, for example, anticipate that mitoribosome assembly factors would be present within the above inventory. However, to date only paraplegin, a conserved subunit of the ATP-dependent m-AAA protease, links the regulation of mitoribosome assembly with human mitochondrial disease based on studies of the paraplegin homologue in yeast mitochondria and a mouse model (7,8). Therefore, it is vital to identify and characterize novel proteins involved in the regulation of mitochondrial translation, in particular those involved in the assembly of mitochondrial ribosomes.",

            "text": "Systematic identification of genes that are found in organisms from several phylogenetic lineages, but remain largely uncharacterized ('conserved hypothetical' proteins) facilitates prediction of human homologues with important functions. In this context, we analysed a family of well-conserved proteins harbouring the YbeB/iojap domain (also known as DUF143). For two members of this family, YbeB from Escherichia coli (9) and iojap from Zea mays, a role in translation regulation has been suggested (10,11). We identified a human protein that shares sequence homology with YbeB/iojap-C7orf30. Published proteomics data (12,13) and our in silico analysis predicted mitochondrial localization. Therefore, we hypothesized that C7orf30 is involved in translation in human mitochondria. Here we show that C7orf30 is indeed a mitochondrial protein that specifically associates with the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mt-LSU). We depleted C7orf30 using RNAi and analysed the mitochondrial ribosomal subunits by sucrose gradient sedimentation and affinity purification methods. Inactivation of C7orf30 leads to instability of mt-LSU and a consequent loss of fully assembled ribosomes that is accompanied by reduced mitochondrial translation and respiratory deficiency. We propose that C7orf30 participates in the assembly and/or regulation of the stability of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome.",

The DUF143 domain of C7orf30 (residues 93-194) shares 33% sequence identity with YbeB of E. coli (residues 6-105), which has been reported to associate with the large subunit (50S) of the bacterial ribosome (9,17) and 29% sequence identity with iojap of Zea mays (residues 116-213), a protein which is involved in the regulation of chloroplast ribosome stability (10,11). Additionally, 24% of residues within the DUF143 domain of C7orf30 are identical to the N-terminal domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP25 protein (residues 104-246), which is required for the expression and assembly of the Atp9p subunit of the mitochondrial ATPase (18) ( Figure 1A and B). Bacterial YbeB and plant iojap share a similar domain architecture to C7orf30, with the DUF143 domain located at the C-terminus of these proteins. In ATP25, however, the DUF143 domain is located within the N-terminal portion of the protein and the C-terminus shares weak sequence homology with the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily ( Figure 1B). Three dimensional structures of two proteins containing the DUF143 domain have been solved: uncharacterized protein CV0518 from Chromobacterium violaceum (PDB: 2id1) and uncharacterized protein BH1328 from Bacillus halodurans (PDB: 2o5a). On the basis of structural features, DUF143 has been assigned to the superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases (NTases) (19), enzymes that transfer nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) from nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to an acceptor hydroxyl group belonging to a protein, nucleic acid or small molecule. NTases are characterized by the presence of a common minimal core of a-b-a-b-a-b-a topology (19) ( Figure 1). NTases contain the following common sequence motifs which include conserved active site residues involved in the coordination of divalent ions:  Figure 1C and D, see hmtCCAse). Our 3D homology modelling of C7orf30 based on the crystal structure of 2id1 indicated that none of the three active site aspartate/glutamate residues are conserved in C7orf30 suggesting that the protein is not an active NTase.",

            "text": "Since C7orf30 shares sequence homology with the YbeB protein that associates with the large subunit of the bacterial ribosome, we set out to determinate whether the  human homologue might bind to the mitoribosome. To investigate this, we carried out sucrose gradient sedimentation of human HeLa cell extracts followed by detection of C7orf30 and the components mt-SSU (28S) and mt-LSU (39S) by western blotting of gradient fractions. We used MRPS18B or DAP3/MRPS29 as markers for mt-SSU and MRPL3 or MRPL12 as markers for mt-LSU. Analyses of the sedimentation of mitoribosomal subunits revealed that C7orf30 is located in fractions positive for the mt-LSU markers ( Figure 3A, fractions 9-12) and low molecular weight fractions ( Figure 3A, fractions 1-6). These results indicate that a part of the mitochondrial pool of C7orf30 associates with mt-LSU. A proportion of C7orf30 that is found at the top of the gradient likely represents free protein or protein in a low molecular weight complex, similarly to the MRPL12 protein ( Figure 3A, fractions 1-6). A very similar sedimentation pattern has been obtained for YbeB, the bacterial homologue of C7orf30 (9). In order to gain further insights into the interaction of C7orf30 with the mitoribosome, we performed pull-down experiments in Flp-In T-Rex TM Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cell lines inducibly expressing either FLAG-tagged MRPS27, a component of mt-SSU, or FLAG-tagged ICT1, a component of mt-LSU (15). It has been reported previously that MRPS27.FLAG and ICT1.FLAG are able to pull-down components of mt-SSU or mt-LSU, respectively, with each of these proteins also capable of pulling down the entire monosome (15). We have performed IP with anti-FLAG antibodies after inducing MRPS27.FLAG or ICT1.FLAG for 3 days with 50 ng/ml doxycycline and analysed the eluates by western blotting. The C7orf30 protein co-purified with ICT1.FLAG ( Figure 3B, lane 2) consistent with the interaction of C7orf30 with mt-LSU. The lack of other highly abundant mitochondrial proteins, such as subunit 2 of complex IV (CO2), in the elution fraction implies specific interaction ( Figure 3B). In contrast, C7orf30 was absent from the elution fraction of the MRPS27.FLAG IP suggesting that the C7orf30 protein does not interact with mt-SSU ( Figure 3B, lane 4). Proteins of mt-LSU (MRPL3 and MRPL12) were present in the elution fraction of the MRPS27.FLAG IP, consistent with co-purification of the intact mitochondrial monosome ( Figure 3B, lane 4). However, the lack of C7orf30 in this fraction suggests that the protein does not bind to the fully assembled mitoribosome. Finally, the specificity of C7orf30 association with mt-LSU was further confirmed in an IP experiment with a FLAGtagged version of the PDE12 protein (PDE12.FLAG) that according our previous studies is a mitochondrial RNase not associated with the mitoribosome (20). There was no C7orf30 nor any mitoribosomal proteins readily detected in the IP experiment with PDE12.FLAG ( Figure 3B, lane 5). Taken together, the results of sedimentation of C7orf30 on sucrose gradients and the IP experiments indicate that the C7orf30 protein associates exclusively with the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome.",

Although almost complete knockdown of C7orf30 was observed after 6 days for the two siRNAs ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S1), it is expected that differences in the reduction of steady-state levels of the OXPHOS components between the two siRNAs result from an unequal rate of gene inactivation.",

There was no marked reduction in the steady-state levels of complex II, containing only nuclearly encoded subunits, suggesting that the C7orf30 depletion interferes only with mitochondrial gene expression. The observed decrease in respiratory chain components was accompanied by a reduced cellular OCR of <50% ( Figure 4C). Quantification of the steady-state levels of mitochondrial mRNAs and rRNAs in cells subjected to C7orf30 RNAi did not reveal any marked reductions ( Figure 4D). These results indicate that C7orf30 plays an important role in mitochondrial energy production. Given its association with the mitoribosome, and lack of observed reduction in the steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts upon gene inactivation we hypothesized that this role is fulfilled via contributions to mitochondrial translation.

            "text": "In order to establish whether OXPHOS defects observed upon inactivation of C7orf30 (Figure 4) were a result of impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, we inhibited cytosolic translation and labelled de novo synthesized mitochondrially encoded subunits of the electron transport chain with 35 S-Met. The incorporation of radioactive 35 S-Met into mitochondrial proteins was analysed 6 days after the HeLa cells were transfected with C7orf30 siRNA. Translation of all mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain subunits was compromised upon C7orf30 gene silencing, with incorporation of 35 S-Met reduced by <60% (for the more potent C7orf30 siRNA oligo 1) as compared to controls transfected with an unrelated siRNA ( Figure 5A). In order to investigate whether inactivation of C7orf30 has an effect on the integrity of the mitochondrial ribosome, we carried out gradient sedimentation analyses of lysates from HeLa cells transfected with C7orf30 siRNA for 6 days and control cells transfected with an unrelated siRNA ( Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S2). Analysis of the sedimentation of mitoribosomal subunits upon silencing of C7orf30 revealed anomalous sedimentation of mt-LSU.     A significant proportion of the mt-LSU markers (MRPL3 and MRPL12) relocated to less dense fractions as compared to control cells ( Figure 5C and D, fraction 8). The profile of the mt-SSU marker MRPS18B was largely unchanged after C7orf30 depletion ( Figure 5E). Of note, the steady-state levels of the component of mt-SSU and mt-LSU have not been altered upon silencing of C7orf30 ( Figure 4A). Next we examined whether the alterations in mt-LSU sucrose gradient profile observed in C7orf30depleted cells result in a concomitant reduction in the level of the intact monosome. We pulled-down mt-LSU and the entire monosome using a FLAG-tagged component of the large subunit, ICT1.FLAG, from control cells and cells treated with siRNA to C7orf30 for 6 days, then analysed the eluates by western blotting (Figure 5F and Supplementary Figure S3). The components of mt-LSU were equally well pulled-down for control and C7orf30depleted cells ( Figure 5F, lane 2 and Figure 5G). However, there was a 60% reduction in the levels of the mt-SSU proteins (DAP3/MRPS29 and MRPS18B) in the C7orf30-depleted cells ( Figure 5F, lane 4 and Figure 5G), consistent with a decrease in monosome formation, presumably due to alterations in mt-LSU integrity. These results, together with the observation that the steady-state levels of mitochondrial rRNAs were not changed ( Figure 4D), suggest that the inhibition of mitochondrial translation upon inactivation of C7orf30 could be attributed mainly to instability and/or impaired assembly of the large mitoribosomal subunit, consequently interfering with formation of the mitochondrial monosome.",

            "text": "In order to further investigate how C7orf30 contributes to regulation of the biogenesis of mt-LSU, we overexpressed mutants of the protein in human mitochondria. A FLAGand STREP2-tagged version of C7orf30 (C7orf30.FLAG. STREP2) was stably transfected into HEK293T cells. Similarly to the endogenous C7orf30, the recombinant protein was associated with mt-LSU as verified by sucrose gradient sedimentation of HEK293T cell extracts after induction of the transgene for 3 days with 50 ng/ml of doxycycline ( Figure 6). Overexpression of C7orf30.FLAG.STREP2 did not have any appreciable adverse effect on the mitoribosome profile ( Figure 6). However, we reasoned that overexpressed mutants of C7orf30 might exhibit dominant-negative effects through, for example, outcompeting the endogenous protein for mitoribosome binding. We selected two residues conserved between C7orf30 orthologues, bacterial DUF143-containing proteins and iojap: D178 and H185 ( Figure 6A). These residues were replaced with alanines via site-directed mutagenesis and cDNAs encoding the D178A or H185A mutants with the FLAG.STREP2 tag were stably integrated into the genome of HEK293T cells. Overexpression of the H185A mutant, but not D178A (Supplementary Figure S4) for 3 days with 50 ng/ml doxycycline resulted in a significant alteration to the profile of mt-LSU as assessed by sucrose gradient sedimentation and western blotting with specific antibodies. A significant proportion of the mt-LSU marker (MRPL3) migrated in less dense fractions typical for low molecular weight complexes as compared with control cells expressing wild-type C7orf30 ( Figure 6B, fractions 1-4). The sedimentation of the H185A mutant ( Figure 6B, fractions 7 and 8) was different from wild-type C7orf30, suggesting an interaction with sub-ribosomal complex(es) rather than the fully assembled mt-LSU. The profile of the mt-SSU marker, MRPS18B, was essentially unchanged after overexpression of the H185A mutant. The changes in the mitoribosomal profile in cells overexpressing the H185A mutant were accompanied by reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis as measured by incorporation of radioactive 35 S-Met into mtDNA-encoded proteins ( Figure 6C). These results provide further evidence that C7orf30 is important for regulation of the stability and/or assembly of the large mitoribosomal subunit and suggest that b-sheet 3 of the conserved NTase-type fold is important for this process.",

            "section": "C7orf30 does not regulate mitochondrial translation at RNA level",
            "text": "In yeast mitochondria a group of regulatory proteins exists to optimize the translation of individual mRNAs. The regulatory role of these proteins can be exerted through regulation of the stability of specific transcripts or by binding to the 5 0 -UTRs of mRNAs and assisting in translation initiation (21). Such translation regulatory proteins have also been reported in mammalian mitochondria implying that, despite significant differences in mitochondrial mRNA architecture (for example: the length of UTRs or RNA polyadenylation), the requirement for precise regulation of the translation of individual transcripts is evolutionarily conserved. The TACO1 protein (CCDC44) has been identified as a specific translational activator of CO1-lack of TACO1 results in significantly reduced synthesis of the CO1 protein despite normal steady-state levels of the CO1 mRNA (5). Several human proteins of the pentatricopeptide (PPR) family have been proposed to play a regulatory role in mitochondrial translation. The PPR family of proteins is characterized by the presence of a tandemly repeated, 35-amino acid motif. Most studies of plant PPR proteins thus far have indicated various roles in RNA turnover, processing or translational regulation in mitochondria or chloroplasts (22). Mutations in human leucine-rich PPR-motif containing protein, LRPPRC (or LRP130) cause the French Canadian variant of Leigh syndrome (LSFC) (23), with proposed functions in positive translational control of mitochondrially encoded subunits of COX (24,25). Other human mitochondrial PPR proteins involved in the regulation of specific events in RNA metabolism or translational control include: (i) PTCD1, a negative regulator of translation acting by modulating the abundance of the leucine tRNAs (26), PTCD2, a regulator of cytochrome B mRNA maturation (27) and PTCD3, which modulates mitochondrial protein synthesis via binding to 12S rRNA (28). Given the structural homology of C7orf30 to NTases, which are mostly nucleic acid modifying enzymes, one of our initial hypotheses for the function of the protein in mitochondria considered its involvement in translation regulation at the RNA level. This position was initially supported by the observation that C7orf30 shares sequence homology with the yeast mitochondrial ATP25 protein (Figure 1), required for the processing and stability of ATP9 mRNA (18). Zeng et al. showed that mutations in ATP25 result in decreased levels of the ATP9 mRNA and its translation product thereby precluding assembly of the functional F0 subunit of ATP synthase. However, the same study has shown that only the C-terminal fragment of Atp25p is sufficient to stabilize the ATP9 mRNA and restore synthesis of Atp9p (18). Our analysis revealed that the C-terminal section of Atp25p shares sequence homology with the metallo-beta-lactamase domain ( Figure 1B), present in many RNA processing enzymes, such as mitochondrial RNAse Z (29). As an equivalent of the Atp25p C-terminal domain is absent from C7orf30, it is likely that the human protein is not involved in regulating RNA processing and/or stability. Consistent with this conclusion is the absence of key catalytic residues of the NTase fold (Figure 1) suggesting that C7orf30 is not an active nucleic acid modifying enzyme. Also, our results of downregulation and overexpression (Joanna Rorbach and Payam Gammage, unpublished work) of C7orf30 showed no appreciable changes in the steady-state levels of any of the mitochondrial RNAs analysed ( Figure 4D).",

In the yeast cytoplasm, approximately 200 proteins and 70 small nucleolar RNAs have been reported to participate in ribosome biosynthesis and at least half of these proteins are believed to function directly in the assembly and/or transport of pre-ribosomal complexes from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm (30). Trans-acting assembly factors are also involved in biosynthesis of the bacterial ribosome. However, owing to the lack of compartmentalization of ribosome synthesis steps fewer proteins are involved in this process. In contrast to the relatively well-studied ribosomal assembly pathway in bacteria and eukaryotic cytoplasm, assembly of the mammalian mitoribosome remains to be described.",

It has been suggested that ERAL1 functions as a mitochondrial RNA chaperone to protect 12S rRNA on mt-SSU during assembly (31). TFB1M (transcription factor B1, mitochondrial) is responsible for adenine dimethylation of 12S rRNA and its knock-out in mice causes impaired assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome (33).

Multiple GTPases participate in the assembly of LSU in bacteria and eukaryotes (30). The yeast Mtg1p protein, a homologue of bacterial YlqF GTPase (also known as RbgA) (35), has been suggested to function in the assembly of the ribosome in yeast mitochondria without a role in transcription or processing of mt-rRNAs (36). The evidence that a human orthologue of Mtg1p participates in an analogous process within mitochondria is circumstantial, though. Human Mtg1 is capable of partial rescue of respiratory deficiency in a yeast mtg1 mutant and it has been localized to mitochondria in human cells (36). Knock-out of NOA1 (c4orf14, mAtNOS1)-a member of the circularly permuted GTPase (cpGTPase) family-in mouse cells led to impaired protein synthesis without loss of mtDNA and/or transcription. It has been suggested NOA1 plays a role in the assembly of mt-LSU (37). hMTERF4, a member of the family of mitochondrial proteins involved in transcription regulation (38), forms a complex with a putative RNA m5C methyltransferase NSUN4. The hMTERF4-NSUN4 complex co-migrates with mt-LSU and participates in the assembly of the monosome (39). Lastly, another non-ribosomal protein involved mitoribosomal biogenesis is mitochondrial AAA (m-AAA) protease that processes MRPL32 at the late stages of the assembly (8).",

            "text": "Our data indicate that C7orf30 is important for the assembly and/or stability of the mitochondrial ribosome, in particular the large 39S subunit. Consistent with the role of the DUF143 domain in ribosome assembly and/ or stability is the phenotype of homozygous mutants of iojap in Zea mays; the plant homologue of C7orf30 ( Figure 1A and B). Maize iojap is localized to plastids, and mutations in the coding gene result in depletion of chloroplast ribosomes and defects in translation. It has been previously suggested that the iojap phenotype results from impaired plastid ribosome assembly (10,11). Our results clearly show that RNAi-mediated depletion of C7orf30 or overexpression of a mutant of the conserved H185 residue compromised the integrity of mt-LSU. Our data also suggest that C7orf30 participates in late stages of assembly as relatively high molecular weight assembles are still present after C7orf30 depletion. Consistent with this are the results of affinity purification of the large subunit using ICT1.FLAG. C7orf30 was clearly enriched with ICT1.FLAG, and recently published data confirmed that ICT1 is an important component of the complete monosome, not assembly intermediates. Also, the bacterial homologue of C7orf30, YbeB, purifies with the large ribosomal subunit (9), but not the 50S* particle (17), which constitutes a penultimate pre-ribosomal complex in the bacterial ribosome assembly pathway (40). Furthermore, in bacteria YbeB exists in an operon together with ORFs encoding proteins involved in late large subunit biogenesis (41). We could speculate that the DUF143 domain evolved to promote interactions between subunits of large complexes such as the ribosome or ATP synthase. The N-terminal fragment of Atp25p, the yeast homolog of C7orf30, contains the DUF143 domain. This N-terminal fragment plays a role in the oligomerization of Atp9p, a subunit of the F 0 portion of the yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase, into a correct size ring structure (18). An analogous role could be played by C7orf30 in assembly of the mitoribosomal large subunit.",
