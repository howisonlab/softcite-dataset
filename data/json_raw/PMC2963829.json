Malnutrition, the most common form of developmental challenge, retards the formation of functional units, the nephrons. The resulting low nephron endowment increases susceptibility to renal injury and disease. Using explanted rat embryonic kidneys, we found that ouabain, the Na,K-ATPase ligand, triggers a calcium-nuclear factor-\u03ba B signal, which protects kidney development from adverse effects of malnutrition. To mimic malnutrition, kidneys were serum deprived for 24 h. This resulted in severe retardation of nephron formation and a robust increase in apoptosis. In ouabain-exposed kidneys, no adverse effects of serum deprivation were observed. Proof of principle that ouabain rescues development of embryonic kidneys exposed to malnutrition was obtained from studies on pregnant rats given a low-protein diet and treated with ouabain or vehicle throughout pregnancy. Thus, we have identifi ed a survival signal and a feasible therapeutic tool to prevent adverse programming of kidney development.",

To investigate whether spontaneous calcium activity can be observed at the time of nephron induction, we took advantage of the fact that branching morphogenesis occurs in the explanted kidney. Rat embryonic kidneys were removed at E14 and held in culture for 3 days. Imaging of intracellular calcium was performed in the outer cell layers of the kidney, consisting mainly of metanephric blastema cells in close contact with the epithelial ureteric bud, which triggers the epithelial conversion of blastema cells and the formation of primitive nephrons ( Fig. 1a,b ). Repetitive transient increases (waves) in intracellular calcium were observed in a majority of cells ( Fig. 1b -d and Supplementary Movie 1 ). Th ese calcium waves could be attributed to the release of calcium from intracellular stores. Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), a sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + -ATPase inhibitor, was used to deplete intracellular calcium stores. Application of the inhibitor caused, as expected, a temporary rise in intracellular calcium ( Fig. 1e ). Spontaneous calcium waves were rarely observed aft er the initial temporary rise. Th e role of extracellular calcium in the propagation of waves was investigated using blockers of voltage-gated calcium channels or by removal of calcium from the perfusion buff er. Notably, infl ux of calcium from the extracellular space seemed to be of little importance for the spontaneous calcium activity in the embryonic kidney ( Fig. 1f,g ). Calcium waves were still observed in cells exposed to calcium-free extracellular medium and endured in the presence of nifedipine, an inhibitor of voltage-gated calcium channels. Th is is, to the best of our knowledge, the fi rst time that repetitive calcium waves have been observed in embryonic mammalian kidney. Repetitive calcium transients confer a unique precision and sensitivity on the activation of downstream target functions because of the numerous possibilities ( e ) Application of 30 \u03bc M CPA caused a temporary rise in calcium, the calcium activity was negligible thereafter. ( f ) Kidneys were exposed to calcium-free extracellular solution, which did not affect the spontaneous activity during the observation period. ( g ) Spontaneous calcium transients were still observed after application of 50 \u03bc M nifedipine.",

Activation of the Na,K-ATPase / IP3R signalling pathway by ouabain has been demonstrated to trigger nuclear translocation and activation of NF-\u03ba B. Here, we show that ouabain activates NF-\u03ba B in serum-deprived kidneys ( Fig. 3a ). NF-\u03ba B activates genes modulating apoptosis 20 and development, as well as responses of the immune system. Apoptosis was found to be a prominent feature in serum-deprived kidney explants ( Fig. 3b ). Th e AI was 7.0 \u00b1 1.7 % aft er serum deprivation for 24 h, whereas in kidneys exposed to normal serum for the entire culture period of 72 h, the AI was 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 % , which is in the range of that previously reported. It is important to note that the apoptotic eff ect was completely abolished if kidneys were exposed to ouabain during the time of serum deprivation (AI 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 % ) ( Fig. 3b,c ). Th e antiapoptotic eff ect of ouabain required calcium release from intracellular stores. Th us, when serum-deprived kidneys were incubated with both ouabain and CPA, the AI was no longer diff erent from that observed in vehicle-treated kidneys. CPA alone had no eff ect on the AI. To assess the link between ouabaindependent NF-\u03ba B activation and protection from apoptosis in the embryonic kidney, we used helenalin, an NF-\u03ba B inhibitor. Helenalin abolished the antiapoptotic eff ect of ouabain, but had no eff ect on apoptosis on its own ( Fig. 3c ).",

Pregnant rats receiving a normal protein diet served as control. Th e off spring of all groups were killed at the age of 4 weeks and kidneys were processed for stereological examination of glomeruli number. In rats, formation of glomeruli is completed at 1 week of age.

Th e concept of fetal programming has emerged from a large number of human epidemiological and animal experimental studies, demonstrating a link between adverse exposures during fetal life and adult-onset diseases 26,27 . Th e kidney is extraordinarily sensitive to the eff ects of an adverse environment during critical windows of development. We have used the kidney as a model organ to test whether ouabain-triggered calcium -NF-\u03ba B signalling may rescue from the eff ects of adverse developmental programming. Ouabain-triggered calcium release is mediated by direct interaction between Na,K-ATPase and the IP3R 9,13 . As these ubiquitous proteins are expressed from the very fi rst developmental stage, and as the role of calcium 1 and NF-\u03ba B 28,29 signalling during development is well documented, we hypothesized that the Na,K-ATPase / IP3R signalosome might have a protective eff ect during development. Th e eff ects that Na,K-ATPase / IP3R signalling will have on normal development remain to be elucidated. Several lines of evidence suggest that ouabain is a mammalian hormone produced in the adrenals and hypothalamus 30 , and that circulating levels of ouabain are high during pregnancy 31 . Ouabain functions by stabilizing Na,K-ATPase in one conformation. It is possible that, during development, alterations in the conformational equilibrium of Na,K-ATPase, which would favour an interaction with the IP3R, might occur even in the absence of a ligand.",

Experimental models have unequivocally shown that fetal malnutrition, caused by maternal calorie restriction or placental insuffi ciency, leads to off spring with fewer glomeruli. Similarly, it has been unequivocally shown that low nephron endowment has an adverse eff ect on the outcome of all kidney diseases and is a major risk factor for chronic renal disease 3,6,7,25,32 . Studies on autopsy material have confi rmed that low birth weight, a hallmark of fetal growth restriction, is associated with reduced number of nephrons in humans 33,34 . A recent large cohort study, comprising data on all births in Norway between 1967 and 2004, showed that low birth weight was associated with a 70 % increased risk for end-stage renal failure 35 . Chronic kidney diseases represent a major socioeconomical burden, both in industrial and developing countries. For example, there are now more than 20 million Americans who have some evidence of chronic kidney disease and are at risk of developing kidney failure, and the annual costs to treat kidney disease in the United States are more than one quarter (27.6 % ) of Medicare ' s expenditures 36 . Cardiovascular and renal disease risks are entwined through hormonal mechanisms, and chronic kidney diseases are associated with increased risk for hypertension and death in cardiovascular disease. Yet, despite overwhelming evidence that fetal malnutrition endangers kidney development and results in an irreversible loss of nephrons and increased risk for renal disease and hypertension, there is, as yet, no drug available that would alleviate the eff ects of fetal malnutrition on nephron formation. Results from this study imply that ouabain, or analogues of ouabain, can effi ciently be used for this purpose.",

Excitation at 340 and 380 nm was performed with a monochromator ( Polychrome IV , TILL Photonics ). Data acquisition and analysis was performed using MetaFluor ( Molecular Devices ). Cells were superfused with Krebs-Ringer with 1 mM probenecid. Calibration was performed using perfusion buff er with Expression of Wt1 and Pax2 genes . Total RNA was extracted from a single embryonic kidney using the Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit ( Bio-Rad ) according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations. Relative real-time reverse transcription -PCR was performed according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations for iScript One-Step RT -PCR Kit with SYBR Green ( Bio-Rad ). Quantifi cation was performed in quadruplet for each sample.

( d ) Box plot of the relative frequency of cells that displayed multiple (fi ve or more) calcium waves during the observation period of 26 min. Statistical signifi cance was estimated using the Mann -Whitney U -test, P < 0.05, z = \u2212 2.506, n = 10 for vehicle-treated (white box) and n = 12 for ouabain-treated (grey box) kidneys. ( e , f ) Intracellular measurements of sodium in primary cultures of rat proximal tubule cells. ( e ) Ouabain dose -response. Cells were treated with different concentrations of ouabain. Graph shows the normalized 340 / 380 nm ratio, which increases as more sodium is accumulated in cells because of inhibition of Na,K-ATPase. Trace is an average from 15 cells. ( f ) Rat proximal tubule cells were treated with 10 nM ouabain or vehicle for 24 h. Three-point calibration using sodium ionophores was performed to measure the baseline sodium concentration (0 -5 min). There were no differences between the initial sodium concentrations in ouabain-treated cells compared with cells treated with vehicle. Ouabain trace is an average of 20 cells. Control trace is an average of 40 cells.",

NF-\u03ba B p65 Transaminase assay was used to detect translocation of NF-\u03ba B to the nucleus. Values are mean \u00b1 s.e.m.; P < 0.001, n = 3. ( b ) Representative confocal images of embryonic kidneys labelled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL, red) to detect apoptotic cells and 4 \u2032 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue) to detect nuclei. ( c ) Ouabain reduced serum deprivation-triggered apoptosis in kidneys. AI was given as % of apoptotic cells. AI was determined by analysing 3 -4 randomly selected areas, with 1,000 -2,000 cells in each area, from three independent experiments. A volume of 1 \u03bc M CPA or 1 \u03bc M helenalin abolished the antiapoptotic effect of ouabain. Values are mean \u00b1 s.e.m., P < 0.01, n = 3.

Diagram shows total number of glomeruli per kidney. The total number of glomeruli per kidney, in rats exposed to low protein, was signifi cantly reduced. Ouabain rescued the effect of a low-protein diet with regard to glomeruli formation. The number of glomeruli in the low protein / ouabain-treated group was not different from the number of glomeruli in the control group.
