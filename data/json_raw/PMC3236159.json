            "text": "Introduction: Vascular pedicle width (VPW), a measurement obtained from a chest radiograph (CR), is thought to be an indicator of circulating blood volume. To date there are only a handful of studies that demonstrate a correlation between high VPW and volume overload, each utilizing different VPW values and CR techniques. Our objective was to determine a mean VPW measurement from erect and supine CRs and to determine whether VPW correlates with volume overload. Methods: MEDLINE database, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched electronically for relevant articles. References from the original and review publications selected electronically were manually searched for additional relevant articles. Two investigators independently reviewed relevant articles for inclusion criteria and data extraction. Mean VPW measurements from both supine and erect CRs and their correlation with volume overload were calculated. Results: Data from 8 studies with a total of 363 subjects were included, resulting in mean VPW measurements of 71 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 64.9-77.3) and 62 mm (95% CI 49.3-75.1) for supine and erect CRs, respectively. The correlation coefficients for volume overload and VPW were 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.86) for both CR techniques and 0.81 (95% CI 0.72-0.87) for supine CR and 0.80 (95% CI 0.69-0.87) for erect CR, respectively. Conclusion: There is a clinical and statistical correlation between VPW and volume overload. VPW may be used to evaluate the volume status of a patient regardless of the CR technique used.

While patients with volume overload typically present with difficulty breathing, clinical diagnosis can often be challenging.

VPW is the distance, measured in millimeters, from a perpendicular line at the takeoff point of the left subclavian artery off the aorta to the point at which the superior vena cava crosses the right main bronchus (Figure 1). Numerous studies [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] report that VPW measurement is significantly larger in patients with volume overload and that increased VPW measurement correlates with volume overload as well. Measuring the VPW is relatively easy, accurate, and objective. (Please see Figure 2 for comparison of VPW measurement in a patient with volume overload vs a patient with normal volume status.)",

B, The same patient after having 10,900 mL net fluid removed 10 days later. Portable CR showed a VPW of 56 mm. Figure adapted and produced with permission from Ely and Haponik. 34 Articles were selected if VPW was measured on CR in patients in either erect or supine positions and if volume overload had been evaluated by invasive and/or noninvasive techniques, including pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), global end diastolic volume, intrathoracic blood volume index, left atrial emptying fraction (LAEF), or total blood volume. Studies that did not report a mean value or standard deviation (SD) were excluded. Two reviewers also independently assessed each included study and evaluated the quality of each article using the Jadad score. 25 The mean VPW, SD, correlation coefficient, and sample size were obtained from each study. Comprehensive metaanalysis software 2.2 and Stata 11 (College Station, Texas) were used for data analysis. 26 The summary effect of mean VPW (weighted mean) was estimated by assigning weight as the inverse of its variance method in the fixed effects of metaanalysis. 27 A random effect model, utilizing the DerSimonian and Laird method, estimated the summary effect of mean VPW. 28 Similarly, fixed and random effects were estimated for cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) as well as correlation coefficiency. Two subgroups, erect and supine, were analyzed for VPW values. The Q-test, which is a chi-square method, was used for comparison between these 2 groups based on Cochran method. 29 A P value less than 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference between groups.",

Studies with publication bias usually obtain an asymmetric funnel plot. 30 We did funnel plots on both erect and supine mean VPW (data not shown). Our results showed that the supine VPW measurement has less publication bias than did the erect VPW measurement. However, publication bias is only one of the possible explanations for funnel plot asymmetry. Factors that can affect the funnel plot asymmetry include but are not limited to language bias, citation bias, the size of effect differing according to study size, and poor methodological design of small studies, etc. 31,32 As a result of the limited data, this metaanalysis included both prospective and retrospective studies.

VPW was initially described using 72-inch erect periapical radiographs. However, supine CRs are commonly performed in critically ill patients using a portable radiograph machine. Thus, it is critical to address the difference in VPW values based on the position of the patient for CR. VPW measured 11 on supine CRs in normal volunteers increased by 17% as a result of gravity. In addition, VPW values can be altered by respiratory effects or by subjects' previous medical problems, especially cardiovascular diseases. 11 For these reasons, the accuracy of VPW measurements on supine CR and its correlation with volume status has been questioned.",

Mean VPW values on supine CRs were significantly larger than in erect CRs (62 mm vs 71 mm, Q \u00bc 77.3, P , 0.001). Analysis of statistical heterogeneity is done using the Q statistic, which is a measure of the variability among studies related to the outcome variable. We chose the results from the random effect model on VPW value since the heterogeneity is presented (P , 0.001). In contrast, results of correlation coefficient from fixed-effects model are used because no statistically significant difference was found between studies (Q \u00bc 0.06, P . 0.05). Our results indicate that different VPW cut-off values need to be considered when using different CR techniques. However, regardless of the CR techniques used to measure the VPW value, they both correlate with volume overload (0.81 vs 0.80, P . 0.05), indicating the reliability of using VPW to evaluate the volume status.",

[36][37][38][39] Recently there has been an effort to replace invasive procedures with noninvasive alternatives. Subjects undergoing direct measurement of total circulating blood volume receive high radiation exposure, and this method is contraindicated in patients with a dye allergy or renal failure and is not repeatable on a daily basis. [40][41][42][43] Bedside ultrasound is used to assess the volume status, including the measurement of IVC and LAEF. However, different percentage of IVC collapse during respiration obtained at different locations (such as at the level of the diaphragm, the hepatic vein inlet, or the left renal vein) indicates relatively higher variability. 51 Echocardiogram to measure LAEF requires more specific training and is unreliable in inexperienced hands. Overall, to date there is no gold standard by which to determine whether subjects have volume overload and how severe it is.",

            "text": "CRs are commonly used in the ED to evaluate cardiovascular pathology. However, some radiographic signs for cardiovascular pathology are considered subjective, with higher variability among different readers. Using VPW to evaluate volume status is relatively objective. In addition, some studies also investigated the consistency of VPW measurement interpreted by the same radiologist at different time points (second reading approximately 3 months later to reduce recall bias; this is considered intrareader variability) or interpreted by different radiologists (interreader variability). The mean average percent variation on VPW measurement among different readers was only 2%. 11 The intrareader correlation coefficient for VPW is 0.82, and the interreader correlation coefficient is 0.84. 20 These studies indicate that measuring VPW on CR has relatively high consistency and low variability. The data from this meta-analysis demonstrate that VPW correlates with volume overload. The higher the VPW value, the greater the correlation with volume overload and/or pulmonary edema. However, it may not be accurate to measure VPW in subjects with recent cardiothoracic surgery or severe rotation on CR or in subjects with mediastinal pathologies. Taken together, VPW measurements may be used as a diagnostic tool to evaluate volume status in selected patients. VPW measurement may be of particular value to emergency physicians, since it represents an easy, quick, and noninvasive method that can be applied in daily practice.",
