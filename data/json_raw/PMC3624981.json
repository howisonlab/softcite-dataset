            "text": "The aim of this study was to evaluate short-term clinical outcomes by comparing hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) with open surgery for sigmoid colon cancer. Methods: Twenty-six patients who underwent a hand-assisted laparoscopic anterior resection (HAL-AR group) and 52 patients who underwent a conventional open anterior resection during the same period were enrolled (open group) in this study with a case-controlled design. Results: Pathologic parameters were similar between the two groups. The incidences of immediate postoperative leukocytosis were 38.5% in the HAL-AR group and 69.2% in the open group (P = 0.009). There were no significant differences between the two groups as to leukocyte count, hemoglobin, and hematocrits (P = 0.758, P = 0.383, and P = 0.285, respectively). Of the postoperative recovery indicators, first flatus, sips of water and soft diet started on postoperative days 3, 5, 7 in the HALS group and on days 4, 5, 6 in the open group showed statistical significance (P = 0.021, P = 0.259, and P = 0.174, respectively). Administration of additional pain killers was needed for 1.2 days in the HAL-AR group and 2.4 days in the open group (P = 0.002). No significant differences in the durations of hospital stay and the rates of postoperative complications were noted, and no postoperative mortality was encountered in either group. Conclusion: The patients with sigmoid colon cancer who underwent a HAL-AR had a lower incidence of postoperative leukocytosis, less administration of pain killers, and faster first flatus than those who underwent open surgery. Clinical outcomes for patients' recovery and pathology status were similar between the two groups. Therefore, a HAL-AR for sigmoid colon cancer is feasible and has the same benefit as minimally invasive surgery."

This procedure is a kind of minimally invasive surgery, but has the features of open surgery [2]. The most remarkable factor of HALS is that the operator's hand can be placed into the intra-abdominal cavity. The operator's hand can palpate organs or tumors, retract structures gently, identify vessels, and provide finger pressure to bleeding points. In other words, HALS is a kind of hybrid procedure between pure laparoscopic surgery and conventional open surgery [2]. Although many studies related to the use of HALS for treating colorectal dis-",

Patients in the control group were selected so as to be case-matched with those in the HAL-AR group in the aspects of age, sex, and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage.

Then, the sigmoid colon mesentery was dissected using the medial-to-lateral approach. After complete dissection of the sigmoid colon, the Gelport was removed, and next steps were conducted as in open surgery. The sigmoid colon was resected, and a specimen was delivered. Anastomosis was performed using the hand-sewn or double-stapled method. After warm saline irrigation and meticulous hemostasis, the Gelport was reapplied, and a pneumoperitoneum was made to check the anastomosis alignment and the dissection plane for bleeding. A Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted into the pelvic cavity via the left port. The right port and the Pfannenstiel incision were closed layer by layer after the Gelport had again been removed."

In addition, the complication rates, as well as the incidences of reoperations, readmissions and mortalities, were comparable between the two groups. However, the duration of hospital stay was similar, about 11 days, in both groups, which was probably because the patients tended to stay a few days longer even though they were on a tolerable diet and in a general condition acceptable for discharge.",

On the other hand, HALS patients had a rather long incision length and more severe surgical trauma than laparoscopic-surgery patients [4,16,17,19,20]. Nevertheless, the benefits of HALS countervail the demerits; that is, HALS had a reduced open conversion rate, the surgeon's hand maintained tactile sensation [2,17,[20][21][22]. Also, when an unexpected or serious situation occurred during surgery, the surgeon could approach the operative field directly and solve the problem quickly when using HALS technique [2,17,[20][21][22].",

However, most studies included diverse categories of colorectal diseases, including diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, sigmoid volvulus, colorectal cancer and so on [8,9,12,13]. In the case of malignant disease, not only the feasibility of surgery, but also oncologic safety should be considered and evaluated. Thus, the number of retrieved lymph nodes should be one parameter describing the extent of lymph-node dissection. Our data demonstrated that the numbers of retrieved lymph nodes were 17.5 in the HAL-AR group and 15.3 in the open group, being more than 12 in both group [23]. Sheng et al. [8] reported no significant difference in the numbers of retrieved lymph nodes between patients who underwent a hand-assisted laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for the treatment of right colon cancer and those who underwent an open right hemicolectomy. However, there are few reports on the use of an anterior resection for the treatment of sigmoid colon cancer.",
