The effects of ethanol are mediated, to an important extent, via the GABA-ergic system. Material and methods: We have evaluated the linkage disequilibrium patterns and haplotype frequencies of GABRG1 and GABRA2 genes in 133 alcoholics divided according to Lesch's typology and in 145 matched controls. Results: Besides several relationships at a threshold of statistical significance, we found no significant differences in the haplotype distribution of these genes between alcoholics and controls. Conclusions: Lesch's typology may not be related with the genotype of alcoholics-at least in terms of genes with an established role in the development of dependency.",

[2] distinguished four evolutionary types of alcoholics, depending on the family history of alcoholism, previous personal psychopathology, and hypothetical neurobiological background. According to Lesch's typology (LT), type I alcoholics (the so-called model of 'allergy') suffer from heavy alcohol withdrawal syndrome, probably associated with dopamine deficits, and tend to use alcohol to weaken withdrawal symptoms. Patients of type II (model of anxiety of conflict) use alcohol as selfmedication because of its anxiolytic effect. In alcoholics of type III, the main characteristic is of an affective disorder and thus alcohol is used as an antidepressant by these subjects. Type IV patients (alcohol drinking as adaptation) show premorbid cerebral defects, behavioural disorders, and a high social burden [2].",

This region contains the GABRG1, GABRA2, GABRA4, and GABRB1 genes, encoding \u03b3-1, \u03b1-2, \u03b1-4, and \u03b2-1 subunits of the GABA A receptor, respectively. Association studies on some of these loci have indicated that a genetic predisposition to alcohol dependence is related to polymorphic variation at GABRA2 or near this gene [6,[13][14][15].",

To define the linkage disequilibrium in the chromosomal region extensively, more SNPs covering the GABRG1 gene located telomerically to GABRA2 on chromosome 4p were studied. These studies concluded that this is in fact the case, and associations observed with GABRA2 might be attributable to functional genetic variations at the GABRG1 locus, or that there may be disease-related variants at both loci. This may facilitate our understanding of the reported associations between GABRA2 polymorphisms and AD and permit a more informed search for the functional variant or variants underlying this association -a search that must now extend into the intergenic region and the GABRG1 locus [16].",

They observed a stronger association between GABRG1 upstream markers in the GABRA2 haplotype block [10]. The key to fully understanding the aetiology of alcohol dependence, however, is to associate these aforementioned genetic findings with behavioural patterns of AD, including Lesch's typology of phenotypes. This typology is important since it is widely used in Europe and especially in German-speaking countries and integrates biological, social, and psychological factors into the classification system [2,17]. Our previous study focused on genetic variants of the dopamine transporter DAT, D2 receptor (DRD2), serotonin transporter (5HTT), and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in different subgroups of Lesch's typology. We have found no evidence for the role of these gene polymorphisms in Lesch type 1 and 2 subjects [18].",

In the rat brain, the \u03bb-1 subunit of the GABA A receptor, encoded by the GABRG1 gene, is expressed selectively in only a few regions such as the amygdale, striatum, and substantia nigra [19].

Consequently, in view of this study's findings and our previous experiments [18], Lesch's typology may not be related to the genotype of AD subjects -at least in terms of genes with an already established role in the development of dependency. It should be remembered that alcoholism is a complex disease with strong environmental determinants. Since Lesch's typology is based mostly on environmental criteria, this may be the reason that no genetic background of this classification has been found thus far. Perhaps other typologies of AD, e.g. Cloninger, Babor, or Early/Late onset [20], would be associated with GABA-A polymorphisms. On the other hand, alcoholism is considered a multigenetic disease [21] and some genes other than GABA-A may still exist undiscovered and determine the phenotype of AD subjects.",
