Materials and Methods: Data from a total of 111 patients who were diagnosed with CP/CPPS between June 2010 and June 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were classified into group 1 (category IIIA, n=40) and group 2 (category IIIB, n=71). Treatment using alfuzosin and levofloxacin was given to both groups for 6 weeks. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index were measured before and after therapy. Results: Group 1 had a significant decrease in total IPSS score, CPSI pain score, CPSI quality of life (QoL) score, and total CPSI score (p=0.043, p=0.006, p=0.015, and p=0.006, respectively). Group 2 had a significant decrease in IPSS voiding symptom score, IPSS storage symptom score, total IPSS, CPSI pain score, CPSI voiding score, CPSI QoL score, and total CPSI score (p=0.002, p=0.004, p=0.001, p=0.001, p=0.006, p=0.001, and p=0.001, respectively). The CPSI score was reduced by 6 points or more in 50.0% of patients (n=18) in group 1 and in 51.6% of patients (n=32) in group 2. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the changes in IPSS and CPSI scores across the 2 groups. Conclusions: Although combination treatment reduced the CPSI score in both groups, there was no significant difference between the groups after combination treatment. We suggest that factors other than inflammation also contribute to symptoms associated with CP/CPPS.",

Of all cases, more than 90% of symptomatic prostatitis is categorized as NIH category type III, which is defined by the presence of chronic pelvic pain and possibly voiding symptoms without uropathogenic bacteria. The new NIH classification for category III further defined these men as either category IIIA (inflammatory) or IIIB (noninflammatory) on the basis of the presence of significant white blood cells (WBCs) in prostatic-specific specimens (i.e., expressed prostatic secretion [EPS], urine specimen after prostatic massage [VB3], and semen) [2,3], However, although some research has confirmed the effectiveness of various treatments according to the NIH classification, no difference in outcome was shown in the two groups. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate clinical outcomes in the treatment of CP/CPPS according ",

Conversely, a patient was assigned to IIIB if the WBC count in the EPS was less than 10 per HPF or the WBC count in the VB3 was less than 5 per HPF [2]. Both groups were evaluated before the treatment and 6 weeks after the treatment by using NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) scores and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Determination of the presence or absence of the therapeutic effect was defined as when the CPSI score fell 6 points or more [5].

The Meares-Stamey 4-glass test or simpler 2-glass test has been used to diagnosis CP [7]. Since Mobley reported the usefulness of a semen culture in combination with urine culture, the new NIH consensus classification is broader than the traditional approach, which was limited to the examination of EPS [6][7][8][9]. Krieger et al. [8] reported an increase in inflammation from 52% to 93% when the diagnosis was based on the addition VB3 and seminal fluid analysis (SFA) to EPS. In contrast, the NIH-CPCRN case-control study determined that semi-nal evaluation had little clinical value in differentiating prostatitis patients from normal controls [10]. In the present study, we did not perform SFA. In fact, most urologists rarely perform the 4-glass test and SFA in clinical practice. Potential reasons are that the test is not sensitive nor specific, the therapeutic predictive value is poor, and the test is relatively expensive, time-consuming, and quite uncomfortable for the patients [11,12].",

The most common treatments in clinical practice are antimicrobial agents and alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists [13][14][15]. A European consensus report suggested that antibiotics are recommended for NIH category IIIA but not for NIH category IIIB [13]. However, Nickel et al. [2] found no significant differences between NIH category II, IIIA, and IIIB after antibiotic treatment. A recent prospective study showed that levofloxacin therapy was effective for CP/CPPS [14]. There are three reasonable explanations, as follows. First, the antimicrobial agent may have a placebo effect; second, the antimicrobial agent may eradicate noncultured microorganisms; and third, the antimicrobial agents may have immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory effects [16]. Also, the treatment outcome was checked after 6 weeks, because this is the usual interval of treatment with an antimicrobial agent and it is generally believed that the bacterial organisms responsible for symptoms should be eradicated within this time [17].",

They inhibit the smooth muscle tone within the prostate gland and in the region of the bladder neck [3][4][5]. Presumably, these drugs are used empirically in the management of CP/CPPS because of overlapping pathogenesis, such as sympathetic over-activation [5,17]. A recent systemic review showed that alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker therapy was associated with significant improvement in CP/CPPS symptoms [18]. Moreover, antibiotics and alpha-blocker combination therapy was more effective than monotherapy in treating CP/CPPS [14,18]. In this study, the combination alfuzosin and levofloxacin therapy resulted in significant improvements in both IPSS and NIH-CPSI scores. However, no significant difference in treatment outcome (improvements of at least 6 points or more on the NIH-CPSI total and domain scores) was observed between NIH category IIIA and IIIB. This suggests that a systemic approach other than NIH classification by the WBC count may be necessary.",

            "text": "In fact, our understanding of CP/CPPS has evolved with the development of the NIH classification. In our contemporary concept, CP/CPPS is not prostate-specific but incorporates other extraprostatic factors including pelvic muscle dysfunction, neurological disease, and psychiatric conditions [6][7][8]. Recently, Shoskes et al. [19] developed the clinical phenotyping system with six domain: urinary, psychosocial, organ specific, infection, neurologic/systemic, and tenderness (UPOINT), and a European study modified the clinical phenotyping system with an additional sexual dysfunction domain (UPOINTS) [20]. They showed that the number of positive domains correlated with symptom severity, and UPOINT-directed multimodal therapy improved symptoms and quality of life [21,22]. Therefore, because leukocytosis on EPS or VB3 and voiding symptoms only reveal organ-specific domains according to the UPOINT system, each patient should be assessed for not only laboratory findings such as a lower urinary tract localization test, but also the nature of symptoms. Although 51% of the patients showed clinical improvement in our study, there was no significant difference between NIH category IIIA and IIIB. This may reflect the heterogeneous aspect of CP/CPPS rather than the laboratory results.",

Second, the treatment outcome was measured only after 6 weeks. It may take a longer period of treatment before an improved symptom score is seen. Long-term follow-up is needed to support our results.
