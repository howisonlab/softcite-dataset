In previous studies we could demonstrate that in AD cortical and subcortical neurons are constantly less frequently affected by neurofibrillary degeneration if they are enwrapped by a specialized form of the hyaluronan-based extracellular matrix (ECM), the so called 'perineuronal net' (PN). PNs are basically composed of large aggregating chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans connected to a hyaluronan backbone, stabilized by link proteins and cross-linked via tenascin-R (TN-R). Under experimental conditions in mice, PN-ensheathed neurons are better protected against iron-induced neurodegeneration than neurons without PN. Still, it remains unclear whether these neuroprotective effects are directly mediated by the PNs or are associated with some other mechanism in these neurons unrelated to PNs. To identify molecular components that essentially mediate the neuroprotective aspect on PN-ensheathed neurons, we comparatively analysed neuronal degeneration induced by a single injection of FeCl 3 on four different mice knockout strains, each being deficient for a different component of PNs. Aggrecan, link protein and TN-R were identified to be essential for the neuroprotective properties of PN, whereas the contribution of brevican was negligible. Our findings indicate that the protection of PN-ensheathed neurons is directly mediated by the net structure and that both the high negative charge and the correct interaction of net components are essential for their neuroprotective function.",

            "text": "Cell death in the nervous system, irrespective of whether it is caused by inflammation, ischaemia or primary degeneration, selectively affects rather constantly special types of neurons, whereas others are spared even under advanced disease conditions. AD represents one of the best-characterized paradigms for this principle of 'selective neuronal vulnerability'. Here, different types of neurons and different brain areas show a differential pattern of vulnerability towards neurofibrillary degeneration, which provides the basis for a highly predictive profile of disease progression throughout the brain, which now is widely accepted for neuropathologically staging. 1 In previous studies we could demonstrate that in AD cortical and subcortical neurons are constantly less frequently affected by neurofibrillary degeneration if they are enwrapped by a specialized form of the ECM, the so-called PN. 2,3 Recent studies identified another stable form of ECM in the central nervous system. Those small, round or oval structures, called axonal coats, are mostly found to surround synaptic sites on dendrites and cell bodies. [3][4][5][6][7] PNs are large meshworks surrounding neuronal cells composed of ECM molecules, which after their first description in the 1890s by Golgi and Ram\u00f3 n Y Cajal were largely neglected and re-discovered only around 30 years ago. [8][9][10] PNs are composed of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs), including lecticans (aggrecan, brevican, neurocan and versican), phosphacan and hyaluronan, TN-R and link proteins (cartilage link protein Crtl-1/HAPLN-1 and brain link protein Bral2/HAPLN-4). [11][12][13][14] These components interact with each other and with hyaluronan, which provides the molecular backbone of the PN, thereby creating a stable scaffold around cell bodies and proximal dendrites of neurons 15,16 (for the principal structure of PN in the barrel field cortex see Figure 1a).",

            "text": "The role of the PN is not completely understood. Different functions have been suggested derived from the functional properties of their molecular constituents. PNs contain both CSPGs and TN-R, known to inhibit neurite outgrowth, and may thus result in a restriction of neuronal and synaptic plasticity. 9,17,18 In addition, the glycoprotein components of the PNs carry numerous glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains, which are long unbranched polymers of repetitive disaccharide units consisting of an amino-sugar (N-acetylgalactosamine). 19 Sulphate groups attached to these GAGs in concert with the negatively charged hyaluronic acid generate a highly polyanionic microenvironment around PNensheathed neurons. 20,21 Most likely, they can, thus, interact with calcium, potassium and sodium ions, providing a local 'buffer reservoir' for physiologically relevant cations. In cortical areas, PN-wearing interneurons are often associated with the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV). These interneurons are identified as highly active and fast spiking, which requires high ionic currents and a tightly regulated ion homeostasis. The anionic features of PNs surrounding these neurons might contribute to meet these requirements. 20,[22][23][24][25] In addition to this physiological mechanism, the polyanionic components might also interact with ions of potential pathophysiological relevance such as iron ions involved in generating oxidative stress. 20,22,26,27 We have, thus, put forward the hypothesis that PNs, through scavenging and binding of redoxactive iron, are able to reduce the potentially deleterious local oxidative potential in the neuronal microenvironment, thereby protecting neurons ensheathed by PNs against oxidative damage. 22,28 In support of this suggestion, we previously observed that both in normal-aged brain and AD neurons ensheathed by a PN are less frequently affected by lipofuscin accumulation than neurons without a net. As lipofuscin is an intralysosomal pigment composed of cross-linked proteins and lipids generated by iron-catalysed oxidative processes, this finding suggests a neuroprotective function of PNs against neurodegeneration induced by oxidative stress. 22,23,[29][30][31] In an effort to validate our hypothesis, we analysed the effects of iron injection into mice brain on neurons with or without PN. We could show that net-associated neurons were less severely affected by degeneration than neurons without PNs. 28 Still, it remains unclear whether these neuroprotective effects are directly mediated by the PN or its components are associated with some other mechanism in these neurons unrelated to PNs.",

To this end, we comparatively analysed the sequalae of iron-induced neuronal damage in four different mice knockout strains, each deficient for a different molecular component of the PN, such as aggrecan (ACAN \u00fe / \u00c0 ), brevican (BCAN \u00c0 / \u00c0 ), tenascin-R (TN-R \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) or link protein 1 (HAPLN1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 ). (for the principal structure of PNs in the used mouse models see Figures 1b-e). We could identify aggrecan, tenascin and link protein HAPLN1 as PN components essential to mediate their Figure 1 Schematic synopsis of molecular composition of PNs in the barrel field cortex. (a) Hyaluronan synthases are located at the neuronal surface, synthesizing and secreting hyaluronan to the perineuronal area. Members of the lectican family (aggrecan, neurocan and brevican) bind to this hyaluronic backbone. So far, versican could not be identified as part of PN in the barrel field cortex. Binding of CSPGs to hyaluronan is stabilized by the link proteins. TN-R crosslinks the lecticans to form stable PNs. (b) PNs of heterozygous deficient aggrecan mice (ACAN \u00fe / \u00c0 ) lacking about 50% of the originally included aggrecan. (c) In mice lacking brevican (BCAN \u00c0 / \u00c0 ), neurocan partially compensates for it. (d) PNs of mice lacking link protein (HAPLN1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) or TN-R \u00c0 / \u00c0 (e) are structured loosely, preventing the formation of stable meshworks neuroprotective properties. These results clearly show a direct albeit differential contribution of ECM components to the neuroprotective function of PNs.",

To define molecular components, essential to mediate the neuroprotective properties of PNs, we investigated the effects of deficiency of a defined PN component on the size of experimentally induced brain lesion. After injection of FeCl 3 into the barrel cortex, a widespread degeneration of brain tissue was observed around the injection site in all mice strains, which could clearly be delineated by Fluoro-Jade B staining (Figures 3a-e). Quantification of the lesion size, however, clearly showed that all transgenic mice strains showed significantly larger degeneration than wild-type mice (Figure 3f). A lack of tenascin-R (TN-R \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mediated the most extensive degeneration with a radius of about 1500 mm of the affected cross-sectional area. Somewhat smaller dimensions of degeneration were observed in mice lacking link protein 1 (HAPLN1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 ), aggrecan (ACAN \u00fe / \u00c0 ) or brevican (BCAN \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) with average radii of the lesion between 1300 and 1350 mm.

The vast majority of degenerating neurons, detected with any of these methods, were devoid of PNs ( Figure 4). Only occasionally, PNensheathed neurons were positive for a stain detecting degenerating neurons.

As summarized in Figures 6a1-e1, no increased protection of PV-associated net-wearing neurons could be observed. In BCAN \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice, PN-associated neurons with PV detected by WFA as well as HAG were even significantly more frequently affected than those without PV.  Aggrecan is upregulated after FeCl 3 induced injury. In addition, we investigated the aggrecan expression in the injured CNS by western blotting. For this analysis, the hemisphere of iron-induced lesion as well as the correspondent contralateral hemisphere were dissected and prepared for subsequent processing. Protein extracts were run in a 6% gel. Western blot analysis with the anti-aggrecan antibody AB1031 revealed a single band at B450 kDa in injured and uninjured hemispheres (Figure 7a). A comparative quantification with TINA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) revealed higher contents of aggrecan in iron-injected hemispheres for all tested mouse lines, with significant differences in mice lacking brevican or HAPLN1 (Figure 7b). Here, the content of aggrecan is increased by 45% (BCAN \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) and 67% (HAPLN1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 ). Furthermore, a significant decrease of aggrecan in mice heterozygous deficient for aggrecan (ACAN \u00fe / \u00c0 ) could be confirmed. Here, the overall content of aggrecan is reduced by 60% compared with the analysed tissue of WT mice.",

Using a comparative approach, provoking a neurotoxic insult in four different transgenic mice strains, each lacking or being deficient in a different molecular component of PNs, we could identify clear differences with respect to both lesion size and neuronal population affected by degeneration. Neurons ensheathed by a PN in wild-type mice were less frequently affected by degeneration than neurons without PN.

Aggrecan is one of the main components of the ECM and the key component of the PNs. 43,44 It is the largest member of the lectican family and carries up to 100 negatively charged chondroitin sulphate side chains. 10,45 Thus, aggrecan interacting with hyaluronan, also highly negatively charged, mainly contributes to the polyanionic character of the PN. Our data show that PN detected by the aggrecan antibody HAG in mice heterozygous deficient for aggrecan (ACAN \u00fe / \u00c0 ), have lost their neuroprotective properties. Most likely, the content of aggrecan in these PNs is reduced below a critical level, which is not sufficient to exert Figure 4 Different detection methods for neuronal death in the barrel field cortex. Degenerated cells after injection of FeCl 3 can be visualized with Fluoro-Jade B (a), an active caspase-3 antibody (b) and an antibody against H2AX (c). All three markers visualize degenerated cells to a similar extent. A microscopic picture with a higher magnification of the different markers (a1-c1), followed by the combination with WFA histochemistry (red) and the neuronal marker NeuN (pink) (a2-c2) allows a determination of affected neurons with and without PN. Scale bar (a-c) 500 mm and (a1-c2) 20 mm the neuroprotective effects. 44 Neurons with PNs, however, detected in the same mice with WFA were significantly less frequently affected by iron-induced degeneration. This might indicate that other matrix compounds providing binding sites for WFA might partially compensate for the loss of aggrecan. In addition, it might show that WFA binding, indicating the presence of highly charged anionic binding sites, provides a signature for the neuroprotective properties of PNs. The hypothesis that aggrecan is one of the key factors for mediating neuroprotective properties is supported by the data received from the western blotting analysis. Here, the decreased level of aggrecan in ACAN \u00fe / \u00c0 mice in comparison with WT mice could be demonstrated. Furthermore, the content of aggrecan in the hemisphere containing the iron injection is increased compared with the not-injected hemisphere in all mouse lines. Here, significant differences could be shown for mice lacking brevican and link protein HAPLN1. However, this clear trend could confirm a certain neuroprotection of aggrecan itself. An upregulation of aggrecan could already be seen in studies concerning neurodegenerative diseases. Lendvai et al. 7 could demonstrate increased aggrecan contents in the hippocampal formation of AD patients as well as in the hippocampal tissue of the AD mouse model APPswe/PS1dE9. 7 They suggested that this upregulation of aggrecan could be based on neuroprotective mechanisms. An upregulation of PN components has so far been shown only for versican and neurocan in the context of forming a glial scar after brain injury. 14 However, versican and neurocan most likely do not contribute to neuroprotective mechanisms, but rather to the inhibition of axonal outgrowth and regeneration, respectively. So, aggrecan represents the most potential CSPG in the context of protective processes.",

            "text": "Another proteoglycan component we investigated is brevican. Here, brevican showed the smallest contribution to neuroprotective features of PNs, if any. This could be demonstrated irrespectively of whether the remaining net was detected by WFA binding sites or HAG. Brevican is an important proteoglycan in the adult rodent and to some extent part of the PN. It is mainly enriched in the perisynaptic structure of the axonal coats while it contributes only marginally to enwrapping of the neuronal soma (unpublished results). Brakebusch et al. 32 could demonstrate a certain upregulation of neurocan in brevican knockout mice, which may partially compensate for the loss of brevican. But, the expression of neurocan, highly upregulated during embryonic development, indicates a strong influence of neurocan mainly during early Figure 5 Detection of death neurons with and without PN in different mice knockout strains detected by triple staining. PNs were visualized by HAG (red), degenerating cells were labelled by Fluoro-Jade B (green) and neurons were detected by NeuN (pink). Merged images were used for quantitative analysis. Scale bar 20 mm developmental processes. Brevican, however, is highly expressed during the formation of PNs until the end of the critical period. Neurocan and brevican have a largely complementary expression profile during ontogenesis. Thus, it is assumable that the upregulation of neurocan in BCAN \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice beyond embryonic development may be in order to reduce developmental deficits. So, it is comprehensible that the loss of brevican does not have a major effect on the 'shielding' properties of PNs against oxidative damage. [46][47][48] The next matrix component we have analysed is the link protein HAPLN-1. HAPLN-1, next to HAPLN-4, stabilizes the interaction between hyaluronan and CSPGs by binding to both components. 49 Of the several PN elements, HAPLN1 starts to be expressed exactly at the time PNs begin to develop. So, it might be a trigger for PN development. Furthermore, animals lacking HAPLN-1 do not form normally shaped PNs. PNs of HAPLN1 knockout mice are diffuse and seem to be less close to the plasma membrane than those of wild-type mice. 13 Our experiments show that PNs lacking HAPLN1 have completely lost their neuroprotective properties. HAPLN1, thus, represents a matrix component that is essential for this function of PNs.",

PNs were visualized by either anti-HAG immunocytochemistry (left) or WFA lectin histochemistry (right). In WT mice (a), PN-associated neurons are significantly protected compared with neurons without PN. This difference can still be detected in mice lacking brevican (BCAN \u00c0 / \u00c0 , c), but is somewhat attenuated in heterozygous aggrecan (ACAN \u00fe / \u00c0 , b) knockout mice. The protective effect of PNs, however, is completely abolished in mice lacking the link protein (HAPLN1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 , d) or tenascin-R (TN-R \u00c0 / \u00c0 , e).  properties. Brevican plays no direct part in protecting cells against iron-induced cell death. However, a contribution to diffusion properties is likely. On the contrary, aggrecan as the main proteoglycan component seems to be essential for protection against iron-induced cell death. Aggrecan is besides hyaluronan in charge of imparting the PN, a polyanionic character. 45 This highly negative charge could be the main aspect of the protective feature. This assumption is supported by our observation that even in heterozygous aggrecan-deficient mice the neuroprotective properties are still preserved in those PNs where sufficient negatively charged chondroitin sulphate side chains are present to generate a WFA binding. 53 Further, our data indicate that the two matrix components, HAPLN1 and TN-R, are also essential for the neuroprotective function of PNs. HAPLN1 consolidates the binding of CSPGs to hyaluronan. 13 Therefore, a strong connection of the CSPGs to hyaluronan seems to be an essential factor. Similar evidence was received from analysing TN-R \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice. This leads to the assumption that TN-R, by way of forming stable aggregates, has a relevant part in mediating a protective aspect of the PNs.",

Double fluorescence staining of PNs by WFA (pink) and the Ca-binding protein PV (green). Sections of wild-type mice (a) show intensely labelled, robust lattice-like structures enwrapping the neuronal soma and the proximal dendrites; PN of mice deficient for aggrecan (ACAN \u00fe / \u00c0 ) (b) or brevican (BCAN \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) (c) look slightly fuzzy, but not disturbed. In contrast, PN of mice lacking the cartilage link protein (HAPLN1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) are attenuated and disturbed with almost no staining around dendrites.(d) Furthermore, Tenascin-R (TN-R \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) knockout mice (e) display granular structures with lesser overall staining around dendrites. (a1-e1) Numerical density of neurons stained by NeuN (dark grey), of PN-associated neurons detected by (WFA, light grey) or an antibody against aggrecan core protein (HAG, light grey) and of PN-associated neurons expressing PV (white) in the barrel field cortex. In mice deficient for aggrecan (b1), link protein 1 (d1) or TN-R (e1), numbers of PN-associated as well as PN-associated, PV-expressing neurons were significantly reduced. The lack of brevican (c1) had no effect on the numerical density of neurons. Data are mean values, \u00b1 S.D. Statistical analysis by Mann-Whitney test, n \u00bc 5. *Po0.05, scale bar 20 mm",

(a-e) Typical examples of coronal sections cut through the lesion at its maximal extension. A volume of 0.2 ml 20 mM FeCl 3 was injected into the left barrel field cortex; degenerating cells were detected by Fluoro-Jade B staining 24 h later. Note that brain tissue volume affected by degeneration is significantly different in different mice strains.

Quantification of lesion size determined on serial sections after staining with Fluoro-Jade B (f). In all mice knockout strains, lesion size was significantly larger than in wild type (WT). A lack of tenascin (TN-R \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) results in the most extensive spreading of degeneration. In brevican knockout mice (BCAN \u00c0 / \u00c0 ), heterozygous aggrecan knockout mice (ACAN \u00fe / \u00c0 ) and mice lacking the link protein 1(HAPLN-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 ), lesion size is somewhat smaller.
