            "text": "Despite initial and often dramatic responses of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-addicted lung tumors to the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), gefitinib and erlotinib, nearly all develop resistance and relapse. To explore novel mechanisms mediating acquired resistance, we employed non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines bearing activating mutations in EGFR and rendered them resistant to EGFR-specific TKIs through chronic adaptation in tissue culture. In addition to previously observed resistance mechanisms including EGFR-T790M 'gate-keeper' mutations and MET amplification, a subset of the seven chronically adapted NSCLC cell lines including HCC4006, HCC2279 and H1650 cells exhibited marked induction of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 and FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) mRNA and protein. Also, adaptation to EGFR-specific TKIs was accompanied by an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) as assessed by changes in CDH1, VIM, ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression and altered growth properties in Matrigel. In adapted cell lines exhibiting increased FGF2 and FGFR1 expression, measures of growth and signaling, but not EMT, were blocked by FGFR-specific TKIs, an FGF-ligand trap and FGFR1 silencing with RNAi. In parental HCC4006 cells, cell growth was strongly inhibited by gefitinib, although drug-resistant clones progress within 10 days. Combined treatment with gefitinib and AZD4547, an FGFR-specific TKI, prevented the outgrowth of drug-resistant clones. Thus, induction of FGF2 and FGFR1 following chronic adaptation to EGFR-specific TKIs provides a novel autocrine receptor tyrosine kinase-driven bypass pathway in a subset of lung cancer cell lines that are initially sensitive to EGFR-specific TKIs. The findings support FGFR-specific TKIs as potentially valuable additions to existing targeted therapeutic strategies with EGFR-specific TKIs to prevent or delay acquired resistance in EGFR-driven NSCLC.",

Although treatment of lung cancers with standard cytotoxic chemotherapies has been optimized for efficacy, 2 recent approaches to NSCLC therapeutics are based on classification of NSCLC into molecular subsets based on their distinct oncogene driver. These molecular drivers of NSCLC can be attacked therapeutically with targeted agents directed against the specific oncogenes.",

            "text": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed or amplified in many NSCLC patients, 3,4 although clinical investigation with EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) identified patients whose tumors bear gain-of-function EGFR mutations as the subset with the best response. [5][6][7] Although, these patients initially respond to EGFR-targeted therapies, all will eventually relapse, a common theme observed in all targeted therapies (as reviewed by refs 4,5,8-10 ). Overall, the median time to progression on EGFR-targeted therapies is 8-10 months. 11,12 Multiple mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted inhibitors have been discovered and validated in patients. Secondary gate-keeper mutations, which increase EGFR-ATP binding affinity, occur in 50% of patients whose tumors progress on EGFR-specific TKIs. 13 In addition, MET amplification following treatment with EGFR inhibitors has been reported in B5-15% of NSCLC patients. 12,14,15 EGFR-T790M and MET-amplified tumor cells can be detected in tumors before EGFR-targeted therapies, suggesting these cells are selectively enriched upon treatment. Furthermore, detection of either T790M or amplified MET with HGF expression before EGFR TKI treatment is associated with decreased duration of response to EGFR-targeted treatments. 16,17 Interestingly, both of these resistance mechanisms retain downstream signaling through the AKT pathway. Also, Sequist et al. 12 found a small percentage of patients who acquire PI3KCA mutations post EGFR TKI therapy, further highlighting the PI3K-AKT pathway as a survival pathway in NSCLC with gain-offunction EGFR. Importantly, this same study failed to detect acquired mutations in B30% of TKI-resistant lung tumors.",

            "text": "We hypothesize that alternative receptor tyrosine kinases that are neither mutated nor amplified may contribute to acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies. As precedent, induction of AXL has been recently demonstrated during in vitro and in vivo acquired resistance to EGFR-specific TKIs in lung cancer. 18,19 Alternative receptor tyrosine kinases, also referred to as 'bypass pathways', have been identified as mechanisms of both intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapeutics including EGFR TKIs. [20][21][22][23][24] Compared with resistance via acquisition of gate-keeper mutations, acquired resistance mechanisms involving induction of distinct signaling pathways lacking genetic alterations are less documented in the literature. To date, the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and AXL has been demonstrated to have a role in acquired resistance to gefitinib. 18,19,25,26 Recently, we reported the protective role of rapidly upregulated fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and FGFR3 in response to gefitinib treatment in NSCLC with either wild-type or mutant EGFR. 27 In the present study, we deployed standard chronic adaptation techniques previously described in the literature 12,14,15 to develop EGFRmutant NSCLC cell lines with acquired resistance to gefitinib. Herein, we demonstrate that FGFR1 and FGF2 are induced during chronic acquisition of resistance to gefitinib, highlighting FGFR1 as an additional candidate for a bypass mechanism contributing to EGFR inhibitor resistance.",

For example, HCC827 cells undergo MET amplification and AXL induction upon adaption to gefitinib 14,15,17,19 and PC9 cells acquire the T790M mutation in EGFR that confers resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib. 13 In addition, studies with TKI-resistant tumor specimens suggest alternative mechanisms that remain to be defined. 12 To further explore mechanisms which mediate gefitinib resistance, a panel of eight NSCLC cell lines ( Supplementary Table S1) with EGFRactivating mutations rendering them sensitive to EGFR-targeted therapies were adapted to increasing concentrations of gefitinib until they could be cultured in 3 mM gefitinib (see Materials and methods). In addition, H1975 cells, which express EGFR bearing the activating L858R mutation and the T790M gate-keeper  mutation, were selected for resistance to the irreversible EGFR inhibitor, BIBW2992. 28 All TKI-resistant and passage control cell lines were submitted to DNA fingerprint analysis to verify authenticity, both before and after adaptation. As shown in Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Table S2, the gefitinib-adapted cell lines exhibited IC 50 s to EGFR TKIs that were several orders of magnitude larger than that exhibited by the DMSO-cultured control cell lines. Of note, gefitinib-resistant cultures of HCC2935 cells were not obtained after two-independent attempts and this cell line was not studied further. In general, gefitinib-resistant cell lines demonstrated decreased phospho-EGFR expression as compared with passage controls cells, although total EGFR did not change significantly (Figure 1c). In addition, EGFR mRNA sequences were amplified by PCR to verify retention of EGFR gain-of-function mutations (E746-A750 del, L747-A750 del, L858R) and to detect any acquired T790M mutations. Consistent with published studies, our findings reveal that gefitinib-resistant PC9 cells acquired a T790M gate-keeper mutation and gefitinib-resistant HCC827 cells exhibited markedly increased MET expression levels [13][14][15]17 ( Supplementary Figures S2  and S3). Moreover, gefitinib-resistant PC9 cells retained sensitivity to BIBW2992 as predicted (Supplementary Figure S2) and gefitinib-resistant HCC827 cells exhibited acquired sensitivity to the MET inhibitor, crizotinib, as assessed by inhibition of phospho-MET and reduction of anchorage-independent growth (Supplementary Figure S3). Interestingly, H1650, H1975, HCC2279, HCC4006 and HCC4011 cells neither acquired T790M mutations nor exhibited MET amplification (data not shown).",

The resulting analysis confirmed the marked increase in MET mRNA expression in gefitinib-resistant cultures of HCC827, [13][14][15]17 but not HCC4006 cells ( Supplementary  Table S3). However, RNA-seq analysis of the HCC4006 cells revealed 2.5-and 9-fold increases in the expression of FGF2 and FGFR1 mRNAs in gefitinib-resistant cells, respectively. Neither MET nor ErbB family members, EGFR and ErbB2, exhibited any changes in expression ( Supplementary Table S2). A recent report identifies amplification of MAPK1 as a putative mechanism of resistance to EGFR TKIs. 29 Our data indicate a modest increase (B2-fold) in MAPK1 (ERK2) mRNA in gefitinib-resistant HCC4006 cells, although this was accompanied by a reduction in MAPK3 (ERK1) mRNA expression ( Supplementary Table S3). Moreover, no significant increases in ERK2 protein or activity are apparent in our TKIadapted cell lines (see Figure 2, Supplementary Figures S2 and S6).",

Instead, phospho-ERK in the gefitinib-resistant cultures of HCC4006, HCC2279 and H1650 cells was reduced or abolished by the FGFR1-specific TKI, AZ8010, and the FGFR-active TKI, RO4383596 ( Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S4). Importantly, FGFR inhibitors failed to effect phosphorylation of either T308 or S473 on AKT, indicating that the induced FGFR1 pathway does not significantly engage the PI3K/AKT signal pathway. In addition, the FGFR inhibitor, AZ8010, did not inhibit ERK phosphorylation in gefitinib-resistant PC9 (Supplementary Figure S2) or HCC827 cells (Supplementary Figure S3), consistent with EGFR-T790M or MET functioning as the major drivers in these two cell lines. Next, control and gefitinib-resistant HCC4006 cells were submitted to anchorage-independent growth assays and proliferation assays in the presence of lapatinib, BIBW2992 and AZ8010. Anchorage-independent growth of control HCC4006 cells was potently inhibited by lapatinib and BIBW2992 ( Figure 3a, Supplementary Figure S1), but not by AZ8010. By contrast, gefitinib-resistant HCC4006 cells were highly sensitive to AZ8010, but the two EGFR inhibitors were without effect ( Figure 3a, Supplementary Figure S1). The FGF trap, FP-1039, 32 completely inhibited growth of gefitinib-resistant HCC4006 cells, but not control cells (Figure 3b), indicating a requirement for induced FGF2 for growth of the gefitinib-adapted cell cultures. As a molecular test of the requirement for FGFR1 in gefitinib-resistant HCC4006 cells, both control and gefitinib-resistant HCC4006 cells were transiently transfected with an FGFR1-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) or a non-silencing control siRNA. The data in Supplementary Figure S7 demonstrate effective silencing of FGFR1 mRNA, but not FGFR2 mRNA. Moreover, significant inhibition of cell proliferation was observed in response to transfection of the FGFR1 siRNA into gefitinib-resistant, but not control HCC4006 cells. Combined, the data indicate that HCC4006 cells switch from EGFR dependency to dependency on FGFR1 and FGF2 following acquired resistance to gefitinib.",

            "text": "We similarly tested the sensitivity of the panel of control and gefitinib-resistant cell lines to gefitinib/BIBW2992 and AZ8010. The findings in Figures 3c and d, Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Table S2 demonstrate that HCC2279 and H1650 also undergo a switch in sensitivity from EGFR-specific TKIs to the FGFR-specific TKIs. Control HCC4011 cells were already somewhat sensitive to AZ8010 (IC 50 \u00bc 84 nM) and gefitinib-resistant HCC4011 cells were only slightly more sensitive (IC 50 \u00bc 33 nM), a finding that is consistent with detectable levels of FGFR1 and FGF2 in control HCC4011 cells (Figure 1). To test whether treatment with FGFR inhibitors induced measures of apoptosis, control and adapted HCC827, HCC4006 and H1650 cells were cultured with gefitinib or AZ8010 for 3 days and cells were collected for measurement of caspase 3 activity as a biochemical measure of apoptosis. The data in Supplementary Figure S8 demonstrate a marked increase (B12fold) in caspase 3 activity in DMSO control cultures of HCC827 cells treated with gefitinib, but only a 1.5-fold increase in caspase 3 activity in gefitinib-resistant HCC827 cells treated with gefitinib. Neither DMSO control cultures of H1650 nor HCC4006 cells exhibited evidence for induction of apoptosis following treatment with gefitinib. Gefitinib-resistant cultures of H1650 cells exhibited a modest (B1.3-fold) increase in caspase 3 activity in response to AZ8010 treatment, but gefitinib-resistant cultures of HCC4006 cells showed no increase in caspase 3 activity following FGFR inhibitor treatment (Supplementary Figure S8). Thus, the findings are consistent with a cytostatic, not a proapoptotic, activity of FGFR inhibitors in gefitinib-adapted cell lines.  Table S3). This presumptive epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is not universal to the acquired resistance response as these changes were not observed in TKIadapted HCC827 cells ( Supplementary Table S3). However, reduced E-cadherin protein expression was observed in gefitinib/BIBW2992-resistant cultures of HCC4006, H1650 and H1975 cells (Figure 4a). HCC2279 cells lacked E-cadherin protein before adaptation. In addition, vimentin protein levels were increased in gefitinib-resistant cultures of HCC4006, HCC2279, H1650 and HCC4011 cells. These changes in EMT markers correlate with phenotypic differences in HCC4006 control and gefitinib-resistant cells grown in Matrigel containing medium, where gefitinibresistant HCC4006 cells form unorganized structures in Matrigel relative to organized spheres produced by control HCC4006 cells (Figure 4b). Thus, the findings in Supplementary Table S3 and Figure 4 indicate that acquisition of gefitinib resistance in a subset of the EGFR-specific TKI-resistant cell lines is accompanied by an EMT program that includes induction of FGFR1 and FGF2 expression.",

As shown in Figure 4c  E-cadherin expression in the gefitinib-adapted HCC4006 cultures, indicating that FGFR1 signaling is not directly regulating E-cadherin expression. In addition, H1975 cells rendered resistant to BIBW2992 also undergo an EMT response (Figure 4a and Sequist et al. 12 ), but do not establish a functional FGFR1-driven autocrine loop. Therefore, FGFR1, FGF2, E-cadherin and vimentin are likely to be co-regulated in a transcriptional program mediating resistance and suggest potential value for identifying patients who might respond to FGFR-targeted therapies following progression on EGFR inhibitors. Further supporting our findings of co-regulated FGFR1 and mesenchymal genes, a study examining metastasis in NSCLC found FGFR1 expression to be a poor prognostic marker for metastasis (hazard ratio of 43). 33 Another group found both FGFR1 and vimentin to positively correlate with ZEB1 expression in NSCLC, 34 consistent with the gene changes reported in our study ( Supplementary Table S3).",

As shown in Supplementary Figure S9, a clonogenic growth assay shows greater reduction in the emergence of TKI-resistant HCC4006 cells following treatment with gefitinib plus AZD4547, an FGFR-specific TKI, 35 relative to gefitinib alone. Likewise, inhibition of anchorage-independent growth of H1650 cells by gefitinib was markedly enhanced by inclusion of AZ8010. The data support the increased efficacy of combinations of EGFR and FGFR-specific TKIs for inhibiting growth of EGFRmutant cell lines that employ FGFR1 as an acquired resistance mechanism.",

            "text": "Acquired resistance has emerged as a major limitation of monotherapy with TKIs. 22,36 EGFR-targeted therapies can significantly improve disease control in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients, but the response is short-lived. To this end, many studies defining mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies have been reported, and technological advances in genome-based medicine have led to the identification of distinct resistance mechanisms including acquisition and amplification of EGFR-T790M mutations, selection for PIK3CA mutations, and MET and MAPK1 amplification. 12,29,37 However, B30% of acquired resistance cases lack identifiable mutations 12 and thus, may rely on mutation-independent mechanisms of resistance. In support of this hypothesis, we used a previously validated approach involving chronic adaption of NSCLC cell lines to increasing concentrations of gefitinib 12,14,15 and identified a subgroup of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines that undergo cellular reprogramming accompanied by induction of an FGFR1-FGF2 autocrine signaling pathway. FGFR signaling is sufficient to drive transformed growth as evidenced by the findings that gefitinibresistant cells are growth arrested by FGFR-specific TKIs, an FGFligand trap and RNAi-mediated FGFR1 silencing. Notably, the failure of FGFR-specific TKIs to markedly increase apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines bearing an induced FGF2-FGFR1 pathway suggests that FGFR inhibitors may yield stable disease, not tumor regressions, if these drugs are deployed to target this mechanism of resistance to EGFR-specific TKIs.",

            "text": "Thus, these findings provide an example distinct from MET of how an alternative receptor tyrosine kinase can serve as a bypass growth pathway in NSCLC cell lines rendered resistant to EGFRspecific TKIs. Similar to our findings demonstrating induction of FGFR1 in gefitinib-resistant HCC4006, HCC2279 and H1650, AXL has also been shown to be induced in gefitinib-resistant HCC827 cells and in human tumors that have progressed on erlotinib. 19 Although we observe induction of MET, but not AXL, in our cultures of gefitinib-resistant HCC827 cells (Supplementary Figure  S10), we detect induction of AXL mRNA in HCC4006, HCC2279, H1650, PC9 and H1975 cells. Except for PC9, induction of AXL mRNA following acquired resistance to EGFR-specific TKIs is associated with an EMT program. Importantly, Byers et al. 18 have demonstrated that AXL induction is also associated with an acquired resistance-induced EMT program. Despite the induction of AXL simultaneous with FGFR1, our data support FGFR1 as the dominant bypass growth driver in HCC4006, HCC2279 and H1650 cells based on sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors and the lack of growth and signaling inhibition by crizotinib (Figure 2, Supplementary  Figures S2 and S6), a TKI which exhibits activity against AXL. 41,42 Clearly, elucidation of the underlying molecular pathways and their prevalence in human lung tumor biopsies post progression with EGFR-specific TKIs will be critical for a full understanding of acquired resistance. Evidence of cellular reprogramming as a mechanism to relieve EGFR dependency during EGFR-targeted therapy has been observed in clinical samples. 12 In fact, it may be a common means to escape multiple types of treatment. For example, analysis of multiple serial biopsies of one patient demonstrated transdifferentiation from EGFR-dependent NSCLC to small-cell lung cancer following erlotinib therapy and back to EGFR-dependent NSCLC following treatment with a cytotoxic therapy appropriate for small-cell lung cancer. 12 The tumor resensitized to EGFR-targeted therapy only after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation for small-cell lung cancer revealing the ability of cancer cells to reprogram as a mechanism for cell survival. The EGFR mutation was identified in all biopsies indicating the tumors arose from a common clone. 12 In support of epigenetic alterations as common mechanisms of resistance, Sharma et al. 26 demonstrated that drug resistant persister cells readily arise in vitro following treatment, regardless of the oncogene being targeted. Importantly, an HDAC inhibitor reduced the outgrowth of drug resistant persister cells, presumably through disrupting the necessary chromatin remodeling-dependent gene expression changes. The EMT phenotype observed upon acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy appears to be exclusively observed in the subset lacking identified mutations. 12,39 Therefore, HCC4006, H1650 and HCC2279 cells could be potentially used to develop an expression signature predictive of tumors that undergo epigenetic reprogramming as a mechanism of resistance and as a biomarker for patients that would benefit from EGFR-FGFR combination therapies.",

            "text": "Although there is increasing support that epigenetic mechanisms of resistance are prevalent in response to targeted therapies, it is well known that other cancer cells are predisposed to pathways involving genetically acquired resistance mechanisms (mutation and amplifications). In fact, germline mutations not specific to tumor cells that occur in the host can be important in predicting response. A germline deletion of the proapoptotic protein BIM poises tumor cells for survival when confronted by the relevant TKI in CML and NSCLC, thus serving a crucial role in how a tumor responds to treatment. 43 Therefore, a more thorough understanding of a patient tumor's mutation status (germline and somatic) and epigenetic volatility will be relevant in designing treatment regimens to prevent resistance to targeted therapies. Although FGFR1 and FGF2 induction as a mechanism of resistance has not yet been verified in clinical samples from matched preand post-treatment biopsies, in vitro studies with NSCLC cell lines thus far have been consistent with established in vivo mechanisms of resistance. 15,44,45 A phase I clinical trial (NCT01515969) combining erlotinib and the FGFR TKI, dovitinib, in metastatic NSCLC will give retrospective information on patients who respond to EGFR-FGFR combination treatment. The molecular heterogeneity of oncogene drivers in NSCLC, which demands flexibility in treatment regimens, will likely be recapitulated in resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Therefore, rational treatment regimens entailing combinations of TKIs must be founded on extensive molecular understanding of the tumors. Finally, the history of therapeutics for infectious diseases such as HIV and TB demonstrates that long-term disease management occurs by preventing resistance rather than treating resistance. 22 Consistent with the advantages of treating with combinations of inhibitors at onset, clinical benefit from treating lung cancer patients that progress on erlotinib with irreversible EGFR inhibitors or MET inhibitors has been rather modest. 46,47 Based on the findings in this study and the increased efficacy of combined EGFR and FGFR inhibitors on specific NSCLC cell lines (Supplementary Figure S8), if supported by future demonstration of increased FGF2 and FGFR1 in lung tumor biopsies following progression on EGFR inhibitors, we suggest that treatment with combinations of EGFR and FGFR inhibitors may be superior to sequential treatment with an FGFR inhibitor.",
