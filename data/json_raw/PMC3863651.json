Overview of Literature: Most clinicians currently use digital plain radiography. This new method allows one to access images and measure lengths and angles more easily than with the past technologies. In addition, conventional plain radiography has magnification errors. Although few articles mention magnification errors in regards to digital radiographs, they are known to have the same errors. Methods: We used plain digital radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to acquire images of the cervical spine with the goal of evaluating magnification errors by measuring the anteroposterior vertebral body lengths of C2 and C5. The magnification error (ME) was then calculated: ME=(length on radiograph-length on MRI)/length on MRI \u00d7100 (%). The correlation coefficient between the magnification error and BMI was obtained using Pearson's correlation analysis. Results: Average magnification errors in C2 and C5 were approximately 18.5%\u00b15.4% (range, 0%-30%) and 20.7%\u00b16.3% (range, 1%-32%). There was no positive correlation between BMI and the magnification error. Conclusions: There were magnification errors on the digital plain radiographs, and they were different in each case. Maximum magnification error differences were 30% (C2) and 31% (C5). Based on these finding, clinicians must pay attention to magnification errors when measuring lengths using digital plain radiography.",

Although few articles have mentioned magnification errors in regard to digital radiographs, they too exhibit these errors because digital radiography uses the same method to acquire photographs as conventional radiography. Clinicians may believe that digital radiography calculates the magnification error after uploading because of its simplicity, but this is not correct. When clinicians do not recognize this point, they may misjudge what is normal or abnormal. Spine surgeons frequently treat cervical spine diseases, such as dislocation and subluxation as well as spine trauma including fractures. As a guide, surgeons will use criteria based on distances measured on the radiograph. Because the cervical spine is comprised of a small proportion of bone tissue, a magnification error is an important consideration when making medical decisions.",

For accurate preoperative planning of total hip replacement, it is important to know and take into account the magnification error. Few studies have examined the magnification error on digital films at the cervical spine. Spine surgeons usually use radiographs for diagnosis and/or assessment. For example, atlantoaxial subluxation is diagnosed in patients with an atlantodental interval >3 mm [7], and subaxial subluxation is diagnosed when there is >2 mm displace- ment [8]. Because it is important that we still use the unit of length, not a ratio, when addressing the cervical spine, we thought that it would be meaningful to know the degree of magnification error that occurs. Theoretically, the magnification error is determined based on the distance between the film and the spine [6], which depends on maintaining the distance from the film and not altering the focus. That is, if the object moves away from the film, the magnification error increases. Ravi and Rampersaud [2] reported that the magnification error was correlated with the patient's BMI. Based on their study, the distance between the film and the spine might increase as the BMI increases.",

First, the BMIs of our patients ranged between 16.0 kg/m 2 and 33.3 kg/m 2 , and within this range there might not be significant differences in the distance between the film and the cervical spine. Second, although we determined that the distance of the film to the source of the beam was 150 cm without exception for the cervical spine, clinically there was a possibility that the distance was different for each patient because the radiology technician usually obtained numerous radiographs in the outpatient department and might not have been able to maintain the precise distance. Although we cannot determine precisely why these individual differences occurred, we believe the important consideration is that digital plain radiography always has a magnification error, which is similar to hardcopy radiography, and there is great variability among patients.",

            "text": "Our study has some limitations. First, we did not include patients with a high BMI (e.g., BMI, 40-50 kg/m 2 ), so we could not evaluate magnification errors of high-BMI patients. Second, we did not directly evaluate the correlation between BMI and the distance from the film to the spine. Third, we used MRI for the alternative measurement. Although measurements taken from CT images are accurate to within 1 mm of the actual size [9], a previous study showed that MRI is as accurate as CT [2].",

Again, we believe that the most important point is that there are magnification errors to consider when using digital plain radiography and that these errors vary widely among patients. Although there are many clinical scenarios where linear measurements from plain radiographs are used to assist in diagnostic and/or clinical decision-making, clinicians need to consider and compensate for magnification error. We also recommend evaluating cervical spine digital radiographs using an angle or a ratio (e.g., percent slip in the lumbar spine), neither of which is influenced by the magnification error.",
