However, so far the molecular components that would give rise to Turing patterns are elusive. We have recently shown that a particular type of receptor-ligand interaction can give rise to Schnakenberg-type Turing patterns, which reproduce patterning during lung and kidney branching morphogenesis. Recent knockout experiments have identified Smad4 as a key protein in digit patterning. We show here that the BMP-receptor interaction meets the conditions for a Schnakenberg-type Turing pattern, and that the resulting model reproduces available wildtype and mutant data on the expression patterns of BMP, its receptor, and Fgfs in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) when solved on a realistic 2D domain that we extracted from limb bud images of E11.5 mouse embryos. We propose that receptor-ligand-based mechanisms serve as a molecular basis for the emergence of Turing patterns in many developing tissues.",

            "text": "The limb has long served as a paradigm to study organ development. Its easy access enabled developmental biologists to use tissue grafting to define organizing centers, and advanced genetics has led to the identification of the key regulatory circuits 1,2 . Early grafting experiments showed that tissue from the posterior limb bud (referred to as zone of polarizing activity, ZPA) induced ectopic digits when implanted in the anterior limb bud 3 . These extra digits formed a mirror image of the normal forelimb, i.e. 1234554321 in mice and 234432 in chicken. Here numbers refer to digits with the lowest number referring to the most anterior digit in the wildtype (i.e. the thumb in humans). The effect was shown to be concentration-dependent in that a smaller number of grafted cells induced fewer digits and failed to induce the most posterior identities in the anterior limb bud 3 . Wolpert's French Flag model explained these experiments by suggesting that digit number and identity were determined by the local concentration of a chemical compound 4 . This compound was predicted to be produced in the ZPA and to diffuse across the limb bud, thereby creating a concentration gradient. Decades after the grafting experiments had suggested that patterning was induced by a diffusible compound, Sonic hedgehog (SHH) was isolated and shown to affect patterning in a concentration-dependent manner 5,6 . In agreement with the morphogen model, SHH is expressed in cells of the ZPA and diffuses across the limb bud 7 . In mice that do not express SHH only digit 1 develops 8 , and in the polydactylous mouse mutant extra toes (Xt) SHH is expressed also in the anterior region of the limb bud 9 .",

For one, polydactyly is still observed even when SHH expression is abolished in the extra toe (Xt) mutant 10 . Moreover, an experiment in which SHH expression is stopped prematurely at different stages during limb development results in an alternating anterior-posterior sequence of digit formation that cannot be reconciled with the standard morphogen model 11 . Thus the shortest pulse that yielded an additional digit induced formation of digit 4, followed by digit 2, and then digits 3 and 5. Based on the morphogen model digits would be expected to emerge simultaneously or in an anterior-posterior sequence.",

Based on experimental observations, the earliest model defined some 40 years ago a set of simple rules to recapitulate the observed changes in the limb buds' size and shape 13 . The modelling effort highlighted the importance of oriented cell division to obtain the elongated shape that is characteristic of the limb bud. Recent 3D imaging data in combination with a Navier-stokes description of the tissue as an viscous fluid indeed confirmed that isotropic proliferation alone is insufficient to explain the shape and size changes during limb bud development 14 . Local gain rates much higher than the measured proliferation rates as well as loss rates had to be included; these may reflect oriented cell division and directed cell migration. The description of the limb tissue as a viscous fluid was first introduced by Dillon and Othmer who studied a model where the local growth rate (the source term in the Navier stokes equation) depended on the concentration of two signaling factors, SHH and FGF 15 . A more recent model for limb bud growth explores the impact of differential tissue elasticity 16 . Other models have focused on particular regulatory interactions that pattern the limb expression domains, i.e. the AER-ZPA regulatory interaction 17 , the establishment of the proximal and distal signaling centers 18 , and the diffusivity of SHH 19 .",

A number of different model types have been studied ranging from continuous to cell-based models and from rule-based stochastic models to reaction-diffusion models; for reviews see 30,31 . Turing mechanisms are a particular type of reaction-diffusion models 32 and have been frequently invoked to explain the emergence of pattern during development 33 ; they have been studied in the context of limb patterning since 1979 34 . In Turing models the number of modes (patterns) increases with larger domain size. Newman and co-workers showed that the different number of skeletal elements in the stylopod, zeugopod, and autopod in anteriorposterior direction can in principle be achieved as a result of the increase in the proximal-distal length; here they have to assume that patterns emerge sequential in stylopod, zeugopod, and autopod and are fixed (frozen) upon their emergence 23 . Newman and co-workers further showed that parameter values can be identified that give realistic steady state pattern if the equations are solved on static domains whose shapes are based on the limb shapes of various fossils 35 . However, there is no evidence that the patterning domain in the embryo has the same shape as the adult fossil and patterning is well known to occur on a growing rather than static domain. Miura and co-workers explored how the speed of pattern emergence could be affected 24 and studied Turing patterning on growing limb domains 22 . In particular, Miura and co-workers show that a Turing model can explain the increased number of digits in the doublefoot mutant with the observed increased domain size 22 .",

            "text": "The many computational studies show that Turing models, in principle, are sufficiently flexible to account for the experimentally observed pattern in wildtype and mutant limb buds. However, in spite of the demonstrated sensitivity of Turing models to domain size and particular reaction types and kinetics the models have so far not been solved on realistic domains with biochemically realistic reaction kinetics. Recent efforts in this direction have been made by the Newman group who propose TGF-beta family ligands as the activator and FGFs, Noggin, Notch and/or CHL2 as the inhibitor in their Turing models with Schnakenberg kinetics 21,23,35 . However, mutant mice with defects in TGF-beta 36 , FGF [37][38][39] , Noggin 40 , and Notch 41 signaling all have digits, while CHL2 expression has been found to be restricted to chondrocytes of various developing joint cartilage surfaces and connective tissues in reproductive organs 42 . While it is possible that the apparent robustness of the patterning mechanism to these mutations is a consequence of redundant regulatory interactions, we wondered whether the reported regulatory interactions would allow us to construct a model that would be consistent with available experimental data and that would not have to rest on missing data and redundancy arguments.",

Limb buds first form around embryonic day (E)9.5 while expression of Sox9, an early marker for tissue condensations, is first observed around E10.5 in the central mesenchyme of the limb bud ( Fig. 1A 44 ). Around E11 the Sox9 expression pattern splits and a region in the stalk patterns the stylopod, two patches mark the zeugopod, and a region of strong expression marks the autopod (Fig. 1B,F,  44,45 ). Around E11.5 the autopod expression pattern splits into distinct patches that mark the different digits (Fig. 1C,G, 44,45 ). Over the next day more defined and elongated Sox9 expression pattern emerge that resemble the final digit structure (Fig. 1D,E,H 44,45 ). Sox9 expression has been shown to be stimulated by BMP-2 46 and the BMP-2 dependent increase in Sox9 then triggers increased expression of Noggin 47 which acts as an antagonist of BMP signaling by sequestering BMP in inactive complexes 48 . Noggin null mice form digits, but the digit condensations are much wider than in wildtype 40 . Much as Sox9, Noggin is expressed in digit condensations and serves as a marker of endochondral differentiation 40 .",

            "text": "Even though BMPs also induce the expression of the BMP antagonist Gremlin 49 , Gremlin (unlike Noggin) is expressed in the interdigital space rather than in the digit condensations 50 . Another study notes a concentration-dependent regulation of Gremlin expression in that low concentrations of BMP2 upregulate Gremlin while high concentrations of BMP2 downregulate Gremlin in limb mesenchyme cultures 51 . It is thus possible that stronger BMP signaling in the digit condensations induces Sox9 while weaker BMP signaling in the interdigital space induces Gremlin. Similarly, it has been suggested that low BMP concentrations support expression of FGF8 while high BMP concentrations repress FGF4 and FGF8 expression in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) 52,53 . Two different BMP receptors are expressed in the limb mesenchyme, BMPR1a (ALK3) and BMPR1b (ALK6) that bind the different BMP ligands with different affinities. BMPR1a binds mainly BMP4 while BMPR1b binds BMP4, BMP2 and less well to BMP7 54,55 . The BMP4-BMPR1b affinity has been established in a Scatchard plot as Kd 5 530 pM 55 . Activin receptors (ActRI/ALK2 and ActRII) are also expressed in the limb mesenchyme 56 but appear to bind their BMP ligands with lower affinity 57 . BMP7 binds ActRII with 3-fold higher affinity compared to BMP2 (Kd 5 1.7 mM versus 5.4 mM) and binds ActRI/ALK2 only with low affinity (Kd 5 143 mM) 57 . It should be noted that the values are based on Biacore measurements and thus do not adequately reflect the cooperative binding effects.",

Thus BMP beads induce noggin, tgfb2, and bmpr1b expression only when implanted into the tip of the chicken digit, but not when implanted in the interdigital space. Also bmpr1a is not expressed when BMP beads are implanted in the interdigital space while expression of the bmpR-1b gene was enhanced in the adjacent digits with the spatial distribution appearing displaced toward the margin of the digits adjacent to the bead 62 . It therefore seems that in the chicken only BMPR1b (but not BMPR1a) enhances its own expression in response to ligand binding. TGF-beta beads also induce the expression of noggin in the interdigital regions but only with a time delay: noggin expression is detected after 30 hours, while bmpr1b expression becomes detectable in the interdigital region already after 10 hours. TGF-beta thus most likely induces noggin expression indirectly by inducing bmpr1b expression 62 .",

We will therefore mainly focus on mouse forelimb bud development and comment on other limb buds as appropriate. In the mouse both Bmpr1a and BmpR1b expression is elevated in the precartilaginous condensations and Bmpr1a and Bmpr1b can compensate for each other 59,60 . BMPR1b null mice show normal digit patterning and no differences in Sox9 expression are observed in wild-type and BmprIB2/2 limbs up to and including E12.5, indicating that the prechondrogenic limb mesenchyme is specified and is able to form condensations up to this time 60,63,64 . BmprIA2/2 embryos are not viable and the severity of the BmprIA2/2 conditional knock-out depends on the stage at which BmprIA2/2 is removed. Cre-mediated excision in Col2-Cre mice seems to occur only in forming cartilaginous condensations, while in Prx1-Cre mice, it acts in limb mesenchyme at much earlier stages (95% active by E.10.5) 63 . If BMP receptor type IA is removed with Col2-Cre digit condensations can still be observed while in Prx1-Cre mice no digits form in the forelimb 63 . The mutants have shortened limbs and show almost complete agenesis of the autopod because of reduced cell proliferation 63 . Moreover, the expression of BMP target genes Msx1/2 and Grem are severely reduced. BMPR1b appears to rescue Msx1/2 expression. However, the expression is then colocalized with the patchy BMPR1B expression 63 . In the mouse BMPR1a thus appears to be the major transducer of BMP signals in limb condensations.",

BMP signaling interferes with FGF-dependent signaling, at least in part by repressing expression of its receptor FGFR1 70 . FGF-loaded beads in turn repress BMPR1b and Noggin expression in chicken limb buds 62 . In mouse limb buds FGFs repress the expression of the BMP antagonists Gremlin 71 and enhance the expression of SHH in the ZPA, which in turn enhances Gremlin expression. SHH induces the expression of BMP-2 and BMP-7 in chicken limb buds, and with a delay that of BRK2 (BMPR1b) 61 . Without SHH digits cannot form unless expression of Gli3 is removed as well 10 . In the absence of SHH signaling Gli3 forms the Gli3 repressor which prevents the expression of Gremlin and many other genes. However, in the absence of both SHH and Gli3 more digits appear than in the wildtype. Neither SHH nor Gli3 are therefore necessary for digit formation. Both Fgf4 and SHH expression terminate around E12 43 but Fgf8 continues to be expressed in the AER.",

We therefore sought to build and analyse a computational model of these interactions. In light of the presence of digits without Shh/Gli3, and the absence of digits in BMPR1A and SMAD4 conditional mutants we focus on BMP-dependent signaling to explain the observed patterning of Sox9 in the limb bud. We find that the interactions between BMP and BMP receptor give rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing mechanism. When we solve the model on a realistic domain we obtain patterns that are similar to those observed in experiments with wildtype and mutant mice. We propose that the observed patterning during limb bud development may be the consequence of a Turing type patterning mechanism that arises from the interactions between BMPs and their receptor.",

We therefore neglect all dispensable network elements and focus on BMP signaling to explain digit patterning. We will include FGF as an important modulator and growth factor. Shhdependent signaling is also an important modulator of BMP signaling in the limb bud and is clearly important to establish the anterior-posterior polarity. Turing patterns have been shown to persist in the presence of such a modulating gradient 74 . Accordingly, we focus on the mechanism that enables the emergence of digits in the autopod and we will neglect the detailed effects of Shh and how these enable the establishment of anterior-posterior polarity that results in the formation of a thumb and a pinky.",

Since the model is an example of a Schnakenberg Turing-type model 90 we expected to find parameter ranges for which we would observe the emergence of patterns. To judge whether such mechanism could yield realistic patterns in a realistic time frame we solved the model on a domain that had been extracted from limb bud images taken at E11.5. Sox9 expression is induced in response to BMP signaling 91 , and we were therefore interested in the pattern of the BMP-receptor complex (C 5 R 2 B) which will mark the regions of active BMP signaling. This pattern is necessarily distinct from the pattern of BMP expression which remains uniform. In spite of uniform expression of BMP we observe the emergence of pattern in the BMP-receptor signaling domains that resemble the Sox9 pattern observed in experiments (Fig. 1J-L). Thus initially (at t 5 150) we observe strong BMP signaling (BMP-receptor binding) in the stalk (Fig. 1J) (marking the stylopod (s) in the limb bud images in Fig. 1B or the humerus (h) in Fig. 1F), two distinct spots in the transition zone from stalk to handplate (marking the zeugopod (z) in the limb bud images in Fig. 1B or radia (r) and ulna (u) in Fig. 1F) and a homogenous expression in the handplate (marking the autopod (a) in the limb bud images in Fig. 1B; digit 4 can be discerned already in Fig. 1F). Within Dt 5 200 the pattern in the handplate splits in the simulation (Fig. 1K) and distinct condensations can be discerned that mark digits 2-5 in the limb bud images (Fig. 1C,G). For the horseshoe pattern to split the BMP expression rate at the proximal end of the domain (rate r b2 ) must be 3-fold higher than the BMP expression rate in the ''hand plate'' (rate r b1 ). Without such a local increase in BMP expression the horseshoe pattern would not split. With time the digit condensations further elongate (Fig. 1D,E,H). In the simulations the digit condensations split while elongating (Fig. 1L). Elongation of patterns becomes more realistic if we solve the model on a uniformly growing domain (Fig. 3E) or if we allow the domain to expand in direction of the highest FGF concentration (Fig. 4). Such deforming growth towards higher FGF concentrations is also observed in cultured limb buds 38,92 . To achieve the characteristic digit shape it is important that the FGF concentrates distally from the BMP-receptor spots (Fig. 4A-C) as also observed in limb buds (Fig. 4D). This is achieved only if BMP-receptor signaling has predominantly a positive impact on FGF expression, i.e. if the BMP concentration is relatively low such that k 1 , R 2 B = k 2 . We therefore predict that at the time of digit formation BMP signaling enhances rather than represses FGF8 expression. We should stress that this is necessary only in order to obtain the correct positioning of the FGF8 expression domain.

Also the appearance of digit 1 appears to be regulated in a different way from the other digits. Thus digit 1 is still formed in SHH knock-out mutants 10 while digit 1 is lost in FGF8 knock-out mutants 38 . The patterns depend on the specific choice of parameters (Table 1), and four instead of five spots could easily be obtained by altering any but the receptor expression rate (Fig. 5A). Alternatively the rate of FGF expression r F could be lowered 10-fold on the anterior side initially and then increase over time; such asymmetry in expression pattern is indeed observed in the limb bud. Thus while Fgf8 is expressed uniformly in the AER, expression of Fgf4 appears to be biased to the posterior site of the limb bud. FGF8 is expressed already early during limb bud development and remains expressed throughout the patterning process while Fgf4 expression is first detected around E10.5 and ceases around E12. As a result we expect enhanced FGF production in the posterior part of the limb bud at the onset of Sox9 expression. However, in this paper we will continue to analyse homogenous expression patterns.",

We further require that the BMP receptor diffuses about 100-fold more slowly than the BMP protein.

In mice that are lacking both Fgf4 and Fgf8 function in the forelimb AER limb bud mesenchyme fails to survive and the limb does not develop 93 . FGF4 is expressed only transiently in the limb bud (between E10 and E12 37,43 ) and removal of only FGF4 does not affect digit patterning 39,94 . The effect of Fgf8 removal depends on the developmental stage. Inactivating Fgf8 in early limb ectoderm (Msx2-cre;Fgf8 hindlimbs and in RAR-cre;Fgf8 forelimbs) causes a substantial reduction in limb-bud size, a delay in SHH expression, misregulation of Fgf4 expression, and loss of digit 1 (the thumb) 38 . In contrast, when functional Fgf8 is transiently expressed, as in Msx2-cre;Fgf8 forelimbs, digit 1 is present and digit 2 or 3 is lost 37 . If we remove 50% of Fgf expression in our model we observe less separation between the spots, similar to what would be expected in syndactyly (Fig. 6A). To lose a digit we need to reduce FGF expression to less than 10% of its normal levels. In this case we lose the middle digit as is the case in Msx2-cre;Fgf8 forelimbs without causing syndactyly. One explanation for the quantitative differences could be the dominance of FGF8 expression at later stages of limb bud development such that removal of Fgf8 corresponds to removing 90% of FGF activity.",

Increasing Fgf expression by 50% indeed results in supernumerary digits (Fig. 6B).

The constant but spatially modulated BMP production rates r B1 , r B2 (black and blue lines) and the FGF-dependent BMP production rate r B* (red line) have different effects on the patterning. The spatially modulated BMP r B2 in the stalk has little impact at larger values because most BMP then binds to receptors in the stalk.

Several mouse mutants have been reported with different shapes and sizes of their limb domain, and larger domains typically correlate with increased digit numbers. Thus GLI3 mutants are polydactylous and the limb domain seems to be widened to 130% while Gremlin mutants are oligodactylous and the limb domain is shrink to about 60% of its original size 10,73 . Previous theoretical models showed that such a correlation can in principle be explained with Turing models 22 , but the domain shapes were not based on real limb buds and no quantitative comparison of domain size and digit number was previously carried out. When we shrink the computational domain uniformly to 60% of its original size we observe a decrease to two BMP-receptor (BR 2 ) patches (Fig. 7A,B), much as is observed in experiments 73 . When we enlarge the computational domain uniformly to 130% of its original size the digit number more than doubles (Fig. 7A). However, in the GLI3 2/2 mutant the expansion is observed only along the anterior-posterior axis 10 . If we increase only the anterior-posterior axis of the limb bud to 130% we observe four additional digits which emerge mainly in the middle of the domain (Fig. 7C,D). A closer analysis of GLI3 2/2 mutants reveals that limb buds are expanded mainly to the anterior side and that extra digits are concentrated in the anterior domain, while the posterior side is about normal. When we analysed a domain that was expanded by 160% to the anterior and constant on the posterior side we observed three additional spots which now emerge in the anterior side (Fig. 7E,F). This corresponds well to the 8 digits observed in the GLI32/2 null mouse 10 .",

            "text": "The impact of growth. The limb bud grows while patterns emerge. Given the importance of domain size and shape we wondered how growth would affect the patterning process. We measured images of limb buds between E9 and E13 and noticed an almost linear growth in proximal-distal direction (Fig. 3A). Limb buds increase in length by about 5-fold within the first four days of development. When we solved the model on a linearly, uniformly growing domain we obtain similar patterns as before (Fig. 3C). However, the number of digits strongly depends on the growth speed (Fig. 3B). For low growth rates we can adjust the number of digits with the help of the other parameters. For increasing growth speeds the speed greatly affects the patterning process and we both lose and gain digits (Fig. 3B). As the growth speed further increases patterns merge and eventually all digits are lost (Fig. 3B). From Figure 3A we can estimate the growth speed as about 7.7 nanometers per second. In dimensionless terms (T 5 432 sec and l 5 0.1 mm) this corresponds to a growth speed of about v g 5 0.03 which is too large to permit patterning (Fig. 3B). This may be the reason why there is a the complex pre-patterning process that we do not consider in this model and which starts already around E9.5 1,2 . The complex regulatory interactions prior to the emergence of digits adjust the expression domains of BMP and FGFs in the limb bud. Such embedding of a Turing mechanism into a sophisticated regulatory network may be important to permit the patterning process to proceed on a rapidly growing domain. Further experiments combined with more detailed modelling also of the other parts of the regulatory network present in the developing limb will, however, be required to either confirm a receptor-ligand based Turing mechanism (embedded in a wider network) or to define an alternative mechanism for digit patterning on the rapidly growing limb bud.",

Based on the available information BMP signaling appears to be the key signaling pathway that regulates the expression of Sox9, the first marker of digit condensations. When modelling BMP signaling we noticed that the regulatory interactions with its receptor constitute a Turing mechanisms. Pattern thus easily emerge. The emerging pattern sensitively depended on the shape and size of the domain, and only when we solved the set of equations on a domain that had been extracted from limb bud images we could reproduce patterns of BMP-receptor activity that resembled the experimentally observed patterns for Sox9. An important test for the suitability of a mathematical model is its consistency of model predictions with a wide range of independent experimental observations. Limb bud development has been studied intensively and a large body of experimental results exists to test the model with. If parameters are chosen appropriately also the phenotype of available mutants can be reproduced. The mechanism is robust to small changes in the parameters as may arise from molecular noise.",

So far, however, it had been difficult to link the components of a potential Turing mechanism to the molecular constituents. We propose that the Turing pattern in the limb arises from a ligand-receptor interaction. For this to work the ligand needs to be a dimer as is the case for BMPs 78 . Moreover, the receptor needs to diffuse, yet at a much lower speed than the ligands as is indeed the case. We notice that the diffusion constant that we are using in this simulation is on the high end of what is plausible; lower receptor diffusion constants can be accommodated but the pattern is then sharper and smaller. Again it is possible and plausible that the additional regulatory interactions in the limb bud help to expand the pattern.",

Interestingly, also here receptor-ligand interactions gave rise to a Turing pattern that could recapitulate the different observed branching patterns in the developing lung for physiological parameters and a similar mechanism can be identified also for the developing kidney (Menshykau et al, submitted). While all three systems are based on different signaling proteins (i.e. BMPs in the limb, SHH in the lung, and GDNF in the ureter) they may all exploit the same mechanism to pattern an embryonic field in that these proteins are all multimers that interact with their receptors in a way that induces receptor expression. Interestingly, while BMP can affect its own expression either in a positive or negative feedback via FGFs 52,53 , SHH in the lung clearly engages in a negative feedback via FGF10, while GDNF in the ureter engages in a positive feedback via Wnt signaling 97 . We can obtain the same pattern with a positive and a negative feedback in the limb, lung, and ureter. However, we notice that the possible parameter space is wider in case of a positive feedback. It will be interesting to model further embryonic self-organizing systems to see whether a receptor-ligand interaction may be a general paradigm to enable Turing pattern to emerge in developmental systems.",

BMP-receptor complexes induce the production of receptors and enhances FGF activity. FGF induces BMP expression. (B) The effective regulatory interactions as captured by Eq (9)-(11). Thus BMP, B, has a positive impact on receptors, R, and on FGF, F, (both via BMP-receptor complexes that are not included here). Receptors are auto-activating (when bound by BMP), while BMP are auto-inhibitory (as they enhance their own decay by receptor binding). FGF and BMP are mutually enhancing each other. For more details see text. (C) The computational domain based on the shape of an E11.5 limb bud. The values for the different lengths are summarized inTable S1. R i are the radial axes of the elliptical limb bud. H 0 and W 0 are the height and width of the stalk. H 1 represents the height of the domain in the stalk where the BMP expression is enhanced. The dashed line indicates the AER where AER-FGFs are expressed. For details see text.",
