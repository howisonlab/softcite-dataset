Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients with ADs were enrolled in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from individual blood samples, and array CGH analyses were performed. Four corresponding genes with obvious genomic changes were analyzed using real-time PCR in order to assess the level of genomic imbalance identified by array CGH. Results: Genomic gains were most frequently detected at 8q24.3 (56%), followed by regions 7q35, 11q12.2, and 15q25.2 (50%). Genomic losses were most frequently observed at 4q35.2 (56%). Real-time PCR confirmed the results of the array CGH studies of the COL6A2, DGCR14, PCSK6, and SDHA genes. Conclusion: This is the first study to identify candidate regions by array CGH in patients with ADs. The identification of genes that may predispose an individual to AD may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of AD formation. Further multicenter studies comparing cohorts of patients of different ethnicities are warranted.",

Therefore, array CGH has been used to detect chromosomal aberrations in mental retardation, epilepsy, and schizophrenia [9][10][11][12]. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to empirically confirm the results of array CGH [13,14]. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR has great advantages in measuring DNA copy-number changes owing to the economy, simplicity, and flexibility of the technique [15].",

It occurs in 2\u223c9% of the population over 65 years old, and the prevalence may be increasing [20]. Modern diagnostic methods, such as computed or magnetic resonance tomography, are able to show an aortic wall hematoma at the acute onset of the disease. This hematoma will develop into an aortic wall dissection over time [6]. Early recognition and management are crucial, and it is therefore important to be able to rapidly identify aortic dissection, initiate supportive therapy, and refer patients to appropriate specialty care [2]. to detect copy number changes in human diseases, but these techniques have several limitations [22]. Therefore, we attempted to use array CGH. Unlike chromosomal CGH, array CGH highly improves resolution and provides quantitative information of the level of chromosomal gain or loss [16,23].",

For relative quantification, the reactions were performed in a total volume of 50\u03bcL, including 25\u03bcL of 2\u00d7 IQ TM SYBR \u24c7 green supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), 10 ng of DNA, and 10 pmol of each primer. Forty cycles of amplification, data acquisition, and data analysis were performed in an iCycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Primers for four genes (COL6A2, DGCR14, PCSK6, and SDHA) were selected and the position of each clone was obtained from the UCSC genome database (May 2004). The primer sequences used were as follows: COL6A2, forward, 5'-TCCATGTCTCAAGCGTTCTG-3'; reverse, 5'-TGGGTT-CTGCCCTATGACTC-3'; DGCR14, forward, 5'-GACAGT-TCAGCAGGCTTTCC-3'; reverse, 5'-TGATCTTGGCTCAC-TGCAAC-3'; PCSK6, forward, 5'-GGCAACAAAAGAAA-GCAAGC-3'; reverse, 5'-TCTCAACAGCTGGGAGAGGT-3'; SDHA, forward, 5'-CTGAGTGATGCCCTGCAGTA-3'; reverse, 5'-TTCCACGAGCAGAGGAAACT-3'. All real-time PCR procedures were performed three times and the normal control was different from each experiment (all three normal samples). The relative genomic copy number was calculated using the comparative CT method[17]. CT for each gene was determined using thermocycler software, and the average of three independent experiments was calculated. The copy number of the target gene was normalized to an endogenous ref-",

Of the more than 30% frequency clones, those considered to have vascular related aberrations in the chromosome were selected for real-time PCR. We evaluated the change in fold difference in samples from normal and AD patients. Fig. 1 shows the regions of chromosomal aberration in the four genes. Gains were seen in 5p15.33, 15q26.3, and 21q22.3, which contain the SDHA, PCSK6, and COL6A2 genes (A, B, and C), while a loss was observed at 22q11.21, which contains the DGCR14 genes (D). The fold difference obtained from the real-time PCR was in accordance with the array CGH results and the p-values of all samples was \uff1c0.05. The gain regions (A\u223cC; COL6A2, PCSK6, and SDHA) in the results from the real-time PCR were equal to all of the gain regions in the array CGH. The relative fold decreases in DGCR14 (D) were reflected similarly.",

A threshold level of 2 indicates significant DNA gain (A\u223cC), and 0.5 indicates significant DNA loss (D). At the chromosomal 21q22.3 location, COL6A2 (A), the fold change of the sample was 2.25-to 3.14-fold (seven samples) versus 1-fold for the reference sample. The fold difference for the SDHA (B) was 2.4-to 4.57-fold (six samples). For the PCSK6 (C), in the chromosomal 15q26.3 region, the fold change of the sample was 2.11-to 4.76-fold (six samples) with a gain at the location. Finally, DGCR14 (D) had a 0.08\u223c0.4-fold change (seven samples) with a loss at the location (p\uff1c0.05).Current research is aimed at determining the phenotypic consequences of specific copy number abnormalities in patients with ADs [21]. Cytogenetic analyses have revealed that numerous somatic genetic changes in the pathogenesis of human diseases are involved in region-specific gains or losses of DNA copy number; however, such changes have not yet been reported in most ADs. Including classical cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot analysis, quantitative PCR based assays, and CGH have been used",

Although our results suggest a new aspect of genomic alteration in patients with ADs, our study was limited by a small sample number (n= 18) and the fact that it only included individuals of Korean descent. Therefore, further studies should be carried out using CGH techniques to validate our results. Information on chromosomal variability can be generated by comparing the results of array CGH with information from the Human Structural Variation Database and increasing patient numbers.",

In summary, array based CGH analysis of 18 patients with AD showed that DNA copy number alterations are common in AD. Real-time PCR confirmed that array CGH properly detected gains in AD related genes. Aortic dissection is believed to develop through a chronic degeneration of the aortic wall associated with aging, atherosclerosis, or hypertension.But its etiology remains unresolved[20]. In this study, we were able to delineate discrete regions of DNA copy number alterations in several regions of the chromosomes that are likely to harbor some relevant genes.",
