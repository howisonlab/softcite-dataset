Methods: A total of 35 eyes of 35 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension using DTFC eye drops were included. Participants discontinued DTFC drops and immediately began using BTFC drops. All other eye drops currently being used were continued. Intraocular pressure (IOP) 1 and 3 months after switching medications was compared with baseline IOP. One month after switching medications, participant preference and adherence were evaluated. Adverse reactions were monitored at each study visit. Results: The IOP was 17.9\u00b12.6 mmHg at baseline and 18.3\u00b14.1 mmHg and 17.8\u00b13.4 mmHg 1 month and 3 months after switching medications, respectively (P=0.633). The frequency of missing a dose was not different before (6.1%) and after (6.1%) switching to BTFC. Significantly fewer participants reported stinging after switching to BTFC (15.2%) than while using DTFC (51.5%, P,0.01). Blurred vision was reported with the same frequency before (39.4%) and after (42.4%) switching to BTFC. A total of 33.3% and 27.3% of patients preferred DTFC and BTFC, respectively. Several patients withdrew from the study because of discomfort (n=2, 5.7%), discharge (n=1, 2.9%), dizziness (n=1, 2.9%), or increased IOP (n=2, 5.7%). Conclusion: Switching from DTFC to BTFC was well tolerated and did not result in IOP changes or a decreased patient adherence. When glaucoma patients complain of stinging with DTFC administration, switching to BTFC is an acceptable treatment option.",

            "text": "The ultimate goal of treating glaucoma is to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) and to preserve the visual field. Initial glaucoma therapies generally consist of prostaglandin analog monotherapy. 1,2 However, when inadequate IOP control with a single analog occurs, a different monotherapy agent or an additional medication must be used. 3 Multiple medications increase the number of eye drops instilled, which can lead to poor patient adherence. Therefore, a fixed-combination eye drop that contains two different medications is recommended. Several fixed-combination eye drops have been approved for use in Japan and have been available since 2011. These include fixed combinations of a prostaglandin analog and timolol (latanoprost/timolol [Xalacom \u00ae , Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY, USA], travoprost/timolol [DuoTrav \u00ae , Alcon Laboratories Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA]) and a fixed combination of a Correspondence: Kenji Inoue Inouye Eye Hospital, 4-3 Kanda-Surugadai, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 101-0062, Japan Tel +81 03 3295 0911 Fax +81 03 3295 0917 Email inoue-k@inouye-eye.or.jp This article was published in the following Dove Press journal: Clinical Ophthalmology 9 April 2015 Number of times this article has been viewed carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and timolol ( dorzolamide/ timolol [Cosopt \u00ae , Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA]). In November 2013, a fixed-combination eye drop containing brinzolamide and timolol (Azarga, Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) was approved for use in Japan. This brinzolamide/timolol fixed-combination (BTFC) eye drop was shown to be extremely effective in reducing IOP in Japanese glaucoma patients. [4][5][6] However, dorzolamide/ timolol fixed-combination (DTFC) eye drops have been shown to be better for reducing IOP reduction than both latanoprost 7 and brimonidine/timolol fixed-combination drops. 8 It has been shown that switching patients from a DTFC eye drop to a BTFC eye drop is both safe and effective in reducing IOP, 9-11 but this has not been specifically examined in a Japanese population.",

Patients were then divided into two groups, with one group switched to BTFC drops (150 cases) and the other group continuing on timolol drops (151 cases). Treatment was continued for an additional 8 weeks in both groups. Eight weeks after group differentiation, IOP in the BTFC group was 3.2 mmHg lower (measured 2 hours after drop instillation) than before the switch. Adverse reactions experienced were stinging (5%), blurred vision (1%), and hyperemia (1%). Nagayama et al 5 administered timolol therapy  9 reported what happened after switching from various therapies to BTFC drops. In the 2,937 patients who switched from DTFC drops to BTFC drops, IOP significantly decreased from 18.5\u00b14.1 mmHg to 16.5\u00b13.2 mmHg. Moreover, IOP was significantly lower in 823 patients who switched from a prostaglandin analog plus DTFC drops (18.3\u00b15.0 mmHg) to a prostaglandin analog plus BTFC drops (16.4\u00b13.9 mmHg). Auger et al 10 evaluated stinging, blurred vision, eye redness, and abnormal taste in 31 patients who switched from DTFC to BTFC. Patients using DTFC drops experienced more stinging and patients using BTFC drops experienced more blurred vision. There were no differences in eye redness and abnormal taste. Rossi et al 11 investigated tear film breakup time, corneal stinging, and glaucoma symptom scale score 12 in 72 patients switching from DTFC. A significant improvement was reported for all evaluations. Adverse reactions included blurred vision (4.2%) and dysgeusia (2.7%). IOP was not affected by switching medications.",

            "text": "Publish your work in this journal BTFC drops. 13 However, this previous study reported that participants withdrew from the study because of adverse reactions, including discomfort, discharge, and dizziness. In our study, 14.3% and 40% of participants reported stinging and blurred vision, respectively. This was not significantly different than that reported in a previous study (stinging in 42%, blurred vision in 55%). 10 Moreover, we observed no severe adverse reactions, which is in agreement with past reports. [4][5][6][9][10][11]13,14 Also in agreement with past reports, 10,13,14 less stinging was reported in the BTFC group than in the DTFC group. We believe that less stinging occurred because of pH differences between medications (dorzolamide/timolol pH =5.6, brinzolamide/timolol pH =7.2). The frequency of blurred vision in the DTFC group was not significantly different from that observed in the BTFC group. This is in agreement with one previous study, 13 but two other studies 10,14 found that BTFC drops caused blurred vision more often than DTFC drops. BTFC drops are a liquid suspension, which is known to cause blurred vision. In a previous study, 79.2% of patients preferred BTFC drops over DTFC drops. 14 Likewise, Lanzl and Raber 9 reported that patients preferred BTFC drop (82.0%) significantly more often than they preferred DTFC drops (8.8%). We found that 33.3% of our participants preferred using DTFC drops and that 27.3% of our participants preferred using BTFC drops. The reason cited for preferring DTFC was less vision blurring. Participants preferred BTFC drops because they caused less stinging. Consequently, we considered the importance of sensation in determining patient preference.",
