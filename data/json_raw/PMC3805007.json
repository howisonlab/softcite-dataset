Available studies of neck pain experienced by teachers are limited. The purpose of this study was to determine whether training of deep cervical flexor muscles with pressure biofeedback has any significant advantage over conventional training for pain and disability experienced by school teachers with neck pain. [Subjects] Thirty teachers aged 25-45 years with neck pain and poor craniocervical flexion test participated in this study. [Methods] A pretest posttest experimental group design was used in which experimental group has received training with pressure biofeedback and conventional exercises while control group received conventional exercises only. Measurements of dependent variables were taken at baseline, and after 2 and 4 weeks of training. Pain intensity was assessed using a numeric pain rating scale and functional disability was assessed using the neck disability index. [Results] The data analysis revealed that there was significant improvement in pain and disability in both the groups and the results were better in the experimental group. [Conclusion] Addition of pressure biofeedback for deep cervical flexor muscles training gave a better result than conventional exercises alone. Feedback helps motor learning which is the set of processes associated with practice or experience leading to permanent changes in ability to respond.",

Traditional methods of teaching, such as school textbooks, are gradually being enhanced and replaced by new forms of IT such as internet sources and interactive multimedia software. These initiatives have resulted in an increase in the number of classes that involve computing. Several studies have shown associations between physical exposures and neck/upper extremity symptoms during computer work 6,7) . Long duration of computer work is associated with prolonged periods of holding a static posture 2) , which is most pronounced in the neck and shoulder region, resulting in increased forward neck flexion and increased static muscle tension in this region 2,[8][9][10] .

It has been theorized that when muscle performance is impaired, the balance between the stabilizers on the posterior aspect of the neck and the DCFs will be disrupted, resulting in loss of proper alignment and posture, which is then likely to contribute to cervical impairment 10) . Therefore DCF training is recommended for increasing the endurance of these postural muscles, leading to improvement in NP. Research recommends that training that emphasizes the correct use of DCF, before introducing strengthening of the global cervical spine musculature, is more effective in the rehabilitation of the cervical spine than nonspecific strengthening of neck muscles. The craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) regime appears to be an ideal strategy for specifically activating DCFs and reducing augmented activity of the SCM muscle. There is evidence that restoration of the supporting capacity of DCF parallels reduction in neck pain and cervicogenic headache. Hence, DCF muscle training is recommended for the clinical management of neck pain 11) .",

A therapist provides the information through the apparatus and by attending to the information the patient forms a \"closed loop\". Feedback helps in motor learning which is a set of processes associated with practice or experience leading to permanent changes in the capability of responding. Patients become more motivated.
