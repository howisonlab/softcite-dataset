            "text": "Background: Development an effective vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is urgent and limited information is available on vaccination in nonhuman primate (NHP) model. We herein report of evaluating a recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) protein vaccine in a rhesus macaque model. Methods: Nine monkeys were randomly assigned to high-dose, low-dose and mock groups,which were immunized with different doses of rRBD plus alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone at different time points (0, 8, 25 weeks). Immunological analysis was conducted after each immunisation. Monkeys were challenged with MERS-CoV at 14 days after the final immunisation followed by observation for clinical signs and chest X-rays. Nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were also collected for analyses. Monkeys were euthanized 3 days after challenge and multiple specimens from tissues were collected for pathological, virological and immunological tests. Conclusion: Robust and sustained immunological responses (including neutralisation antibody) were elicited by the rRBD vaccination. Besides, rRBD vaccination alleviated pneumonia with evidence of reduced tissue impairment and clinical manifestation in monkeys. Furthermore, the rRBD vaccine decreased viral load of lung, trachea and oropharyngeal swabs of monkeys. These data in NHP paves a way for further development of an effective human vaccine against MERS-CoV infection."

            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the only lineage C betacoronavirus known to infect humans (Annan et al., 2013;Anthony et al., 2013;van Boheemen et al., 2012). Similarly to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV infection can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ dysfunction, including progressive renal function impairment (Zaki et al., 2012). According to the World Health Organization, by the end of 12 August 2015, a total of 1401 cases had been laboratory confirmed, with at least 500 deaths following MERS-CoV infection. Among them, 186 MERS-CoV infection cases, including 36 deaths, had been reported by the Republic of Korea (http://www.who.int/csr/don/12-august-2015mers-saudi-arabia/en/). These recent clustered cases firstly sprang up outside the Arabian Peninsula, indicating the potential human-tohuman transmission of MERS-CoV. To date, no specific antiviral drug exists for MERS-CoV infection and supportive treatment is the mainstay of management (Zumla et al., 2015). Ribavirin and interferon alfa-2b exhibited potential in a rhesus macaque model (Falzarano et al., 2013a, b), but in a retrospective cohort study, ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy was associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection (Omrani et al., 2014). Besides, specific peptide fusion inhibitors of MERS-CoV (Lu et al., 2014), convalescent sera from recovered patient and human monoclonal neutralising antibodies (Jiang et al., 2014;Tang et al., 2014;Ying et al., 2014) provided a novel approach to MERS-CoV treatment. However, more data are needed from animal studies and carefully done clinical studies (Zumla et al., 2015). Therefore, developing a prophylactic vaccine against MERS-CoV infection remains a priority (Papaneri et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Considerable evidence has proved that recombinant receptor binding domain (rRBD)-based subunit vaccine is a promising candidate vaccine against the SARS-CoV infection. As rRBD of SARS-CoV Spike protein induced strong neutralisation antibody and long-term protective immunity in rabbits and mice and completely protected immunized mice from SARS-CoV infection (Zhu et al., 2013). Furthermore, high titres of neutralisation antibodies in non-human primates (NHP) were induced by vaccination with the rRBD of SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2012). Experience using rRBD-based subunit vaccines against SARS could inform the design of a rRBD-based MERS vaccine. Several human neutralising antibodies targeting the RBD of the MERS-CoV spike protein, have been identified from the na\u00efve-antibody library (Tang et al., 2014;Ying et al., 2014), suggesting that RBD contains epitopes that can induce nAbs and therefore may represent a target antigen against MERS-CoV. Our group and others have confirmed rRBD protein induced strong neutralising antibody responses against MERS-CoV infection in mice and rabbits (Du et al., 2013;Lan et al., 2014;Ma et al., 2014;Mou et al., 2013;Zhang et al., 2015). Although the rRBD subunit vaccine is a highly potent neutraliser of antibodies and T-cell immune responses, no formulation has been tested on a higher animal model with MERS-CoV challenge to verify its prophylactic efficacy (Gretebeck and Subbarao, 2015). Recently, MERS-CoV infection and disease animal models have been developed (Agrawal et al., 2015;de Wit et al., 2013a,b;Falzarano et al., 2014;Munster et al., 2013;Pascal et al., 2015;Yao et al., 2013;Zhao et al., 2014), including a rhesus macaque model of naturally permissive MERS-CoV disease (de Wit et al., 2013a,b;Munster et al., 2013;Yao et al., 2013). We herein evaluate a rRBD subunit vaccine in a rhesus macaque model, to identify a prophylactic approach that could be used in humans to prevent MERS-CoV infection.",

In contrast, a mild-tomoderate-sized lesion was observed in the lung tissue of rRBDimmunised monkeys (Fig. 4c-f). Infiltration of inflammatory cells was also detected in the tracheas of mock group monkeys (Fig. 4g). Although inflammatory cell infiltration and impaired epithelium in the tunica mucosa bronchiorum were also found in the rRBD vaccination group (Fig. 4h-i), all of the lesion were alleviated compared to the control group. Glomerular capsule expansion was observed in the kidneys of all challenge monkeys (data not shown), but this was considered an incidental, clinically non-significant finding. No specific pathological changes were observed in the spleens of immunised monkeys (data not shown).

            "text": "The MERS virus, which emerged in 2012, is now considered a threat to global public health. Developing an effective vaccine is important to control MERS-CoV infection. To date, virus-vector vaccines, such as recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which expresses full-length MERS-CoV spike protein (MVA-MERS-S), and recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding the full-length MERS-CoV S protein (Ad5.MERS-S) and the S1 extracellular domain of S protein (Ad5.MERS-S1), have been developed and tested for their ability to induce virus-neutralising antibodies in mice (Kim et al., 2014;Song et al., 2013;Volz et al., 2015). Besides, the rRBD subunit vaccine confers a highly potent neutralising antibody and T-cell immune response in mice (Zhang et al., 2014). However, few studies have been assessed in response to MERS-CoV challenge to verify their efficacy, due to a lack of animal models. For example, mice (Coleman et al., 2014;Scobey et al., 2013), hamsters (de Wit et al., 2013a and ferrets (Raj et al., 2014) had not been proved to infect with MERS-CoV naturally. Recently, a small animal model of MERS-CoV infection was developed by transducing mice with an adenovirus vector expressing human DPP4 (Zhao et al., 2014). However, MERS-CoV infection in this model is highly dependent on the transduction of cells and the level of DPP4 expression from the adenovirus vector, and therefore does not necessarily reflect the natural disease process (Falzarano et al., 2014). More recently a transgenic mouse model of MERS-CoV has been published (Agrawal et al., 2015). However, in this model, all cells of the mouse express human DPP4. This kind of non-physiological expression patterns resulted in extensive brain infection of MERS-CoV and rapidly succumbs to infection in mice. Moreover, a novel humanized mouse model of MERS-CoV infection was developed, though the mice were not acquired by routine technology (Pascal et al., 2015). Encouragingly, rhesus macaque models are naturally permissive to MERS-CoV disease, and more closely mimic the disease course in human patients (de Wit et al., 2013a,b;Munster et al., 2013;Yao et al., 2013). Furthermore, the effects of interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin treatment have been evaluated in these models (Falzarano et al., 2013a,b). Therefore, we herein assessed rRBD vaccine efficacy in a NHP model. Similar as the rRBD protein of SARS-CoV which induced high titres of protective anti-RBD antibody responses in NHPs (Wang et al., 2012), the rRBD vaccination of MERS-CoV induced effective IgG and neutralisation antibodies in our rhesus macaque model. Besides, the induced IgG and neutralisation antibodies maintained for at least 17 weeks without obvious attenuation. Following a subsequent boost, antibody titres reached almost their previous peak level. There was no evident difference for induction of the humoral immunity between high and low dose groups. However, high-dose vaccination induced a stronger T-cell response than the low-dose vaccination. Following MERS-CoV challenge, rhesus macaques exhibited a transient lower respiratory tract infection, in accordance with previous reports (de Wit et al., 2013a,b;Munster et al., 2013;Yao et al., 2013). Although infection was also detected in rRBDimmunised animals, clinical signs were alleviated. Pathological changes in the lungs and tracheas of rRBD-immunised animals indicated reduced, but not fully absent lesions. Using qRT-PCR assay, viral loads in the lungs, trachea and oropharyngeal swabs of the rRBD vaccination groups were decreased. Furthermore, rRBD-immunised monkeys could not isolate MERS-CoV from the lungs while viral loads in the lungs and trachea of mock monkeys were as high as 50 and 100 TCID 50 /mL, respectively. Consistent with the results of immunity elicited by high and low  dose of rRBD vaccine, the protection against MERS-CoV infection in monkey could be contributed to the humoral immune especially the neutralising antibodies rather than the cellular mediated immunity.",

            "text": "Although rRBD vaccination alleviated pneumonia and decreased viral load in the rhesus macaque upon challenge with MERS-CoV in this study, it did not prevent the infection of MERS-CoV completely. The data should be interpreted with some cautions. First, the rhesus macaque models to mimic MERS-CoV infection had inevitable limitations. In both the present and previous reports, MERS-CoV challenge in the rhesus macaque models resulted in transient infection of the lower respiratory tract (de Wit et al., 2013a,b;Munster et al., 2013;Yao et al., 2013) and the more severe or even lethal disease course frequently associated with human cases was not observed herein (van den Brand et al., 2015). Therefore, the prophylactic effects of the rRBD vaccine were not fully demonstrated in this model. Second, MERS-CoV challenge in the trachea bypasses the natural entry sites, such as nasal mucosa and laryngeal areas of the pharynx which show as crucial regions of mucosal immunity (Sato and Kiyono, 2012), while, the bypassed mucosal immunity is the first defence against lots of infectious diseases, including MERS-CoV (Neutra and K. P., 2006). Third, the challenge dose of 6.5 \u00d7 10 7 TCID 50 , was markedly greater than typical MERS-CoV exposure in humans. More recently, a progressive and lethal pneumonia was observed in a MERS-CoV challenged common marmoset model (Falzarano et al., 2014), in which the infected animals developed viremia, and total RNA sequencing demonstrated the induction of immune and inflammatory pathways (Falzarano et al., 2014). Therefore, the marmoset model corresponds closely to the disease course in humans and allows for clearer discrimination between successfully treated and control animals. Therefore, the protective efficacy of this vaccine candidate remains to be tested in a more suitable disease model (e.g. common marmoset) or humans.",

We observed sustained and significant antibody neutralisation and T-cell immunity in rhesus macaques in response to rRBD of MERS-CoV. Besides, the rRBD vaccination alleviated pneumonia and decreased viral load in the rhesus macaque upon challenge with MERS-CoV. In summary, our results provide insight into the immunogenicity of an rRBD subunit vaccine against MERS-CoV. All these data indicate that the subunit rRBD vaccine confers partial protection against MERS-CoV challenge in rhesus macaques, which could be useful for future MERS-CoV vaccine trials and prevention strategies."
