            "text": "S imulation models, now widely used in the physical sciences, can also help economists in depicting the actions and interactions of individuals and firms through time. Such models can be built and run on any personal computer. They can illuminate a wide variety of issues that are difficult to analyze with an economist's conventional tool-kit and are especially useful in studying dynamic processes. Microsimulation models allow the analyst to produce simulated aggregate time series that are rigorously consistent with the assumptions made about behavior on the micro level. Thus, simulations provide a means of bridging the micro-macro split in economic analysis. This article provides an introduction to microsimulation: how it works, how to do it, its potential, and its drawbacks. It then allows readers, even those with no experience in computer programming, to work through the details of a simple microsimulation model. Readers can put this model on their PCs, watch it run through its paces, and experiment with their own modifications. With this model as an example, it should be fairly easy to create programs for new models on other subjects for use in theoretical exploration, empirical research, or classroom demonstrations. The demonstration model I present depicts the experience of individual workers during recession and recovery in the labor market. As the model runs, its internal \"Census Bureau\" performs surveys on the microlevel, and sums up to macrolevel variables. The model is simple, but it has some interesting applications. After explaining how to set it up, I use it to explore the effect of unemployment insurance on the level of unemployment, and to point up a common fallacy in current labor market literature.",

He simulated individuals picking spouses, accumulating assets, having children, dying, and leaving an inheritance to one or more of the children. His model displays the resulting trends in the degree of inequality by computing simulated time series of Gini coefficients based on the simulated microdata. Pryor's model can be embodied in a program of 75 lines. Large-scale microsimulation models that sum to national income accounts have been built by Eliason for Sweden (1976), by Adelman and Robinson for Korea (1978), and by Bennett and Bergmann for the United States (1986).",

Our delineation here of unemployment insurance shows how a government program with nonlinear rules can easily be added to a simulation model with a very few additional computer instructions.

Data can be used to estimate a model's parameters and to gauge its goodness of fit (Bergmann, 1974;1989).",

Sometimes the actor does not have the information that economic theory assumes, like a reliable demand curve for one's product, or a good line on what one's competitor is likely to do. Sometimes there is too much information around, and it is difficult to process it all. Sometimes the actor cannot be presumed to know the optimization technique. In such cases, simulated experimentation with the effects of varying rules of thumb may be the nearest possible approach to optimization. Some empirical research (Tversky and Kahneman, 1988; Thaler's columns in this Journal) suggests that human beings are apt to follow rules that produce results that are inferior to those obtained with rules that economists might devise. Where this is the case, simulations of non-optimal but empirically true behavior patterns should yield more realistic predictions than normative theories that are empirically false.",

After these steps have been taken, one can run the simulation program, and watch unemployed workers searching for jobs, interacting with employers who have empty job slots they want to fill. An unemployment insurance system is added to this simulated labor market, complete with eligibility requirements and limited-time benefits. Then, by running the model again, we can see what difference the unemployment insurance program makes to the unemployment rate. To preview the results, the simulation will show that, contrary to the claims of conventional analysts, refusals of job offers by stipend-receiving malingerers does not in all circumstances increase the number of unemployed people. The simulation avoids a narrow focus on the isolated choice of a single worker, thus bringing to visibility a point that conventional analysts tend to lose sight of as they verbally pass from the micro to the macro: that the refusal of one worker to take a particular job allows another worker a shot at that vacancy.",

This model will use just two pieces of information about each of them. IEMPST(I) is the current employment status of the Ith worker, which takes the value 0 if the worker is unemployed and the value 1 if the worker is employed. IDATE(I) is the week the Ith worker last moved from employment to unemployment. For example, if the 4th worker makes such a move in the 3rd week of the simulation, IDATE(4) is at that point set equal to 3. In the course of the simulation, the worker's activities take the form of changes in those values. A worker can be \"observed\" by the analyst at any point in simulated time by asking the computer for a printout of the current value of these two variables for that worker. 1 One device used in many simulation programs, including this one, is the introduction of an element of randomness to the action. For example, in depicting labor turnover, individual workers are picked at random to leave their jobs and become unemployed, rather than being chosen by some systematic rule, as might be the case in a more complex model. 2 BASIC provides the computer with a routine for the computation of random numbers with uniform distribution between 0 and 1. Whenever the variable RND appears in an instruction the computer is executing, a new random number is computed, and RND takes on the value of that number.",

In the tighter labor market periods, when employers want to fill jobs that would employ all but 5 percent of the labor force, the heavy malingering behavior we have assumed in the simulation raises the measured unemployment rate to 6.2 percent.

However, their simulations look at individuals and their unemployment spells one at a time, and neglect the way one worker's actions affect another's opportunities. 9 Hamermesh (1977) and Clark and Summers (1982) speculated that the state of the labor market would affect the extent to which unemployment insurance raised the level of unemployment, and suggested that high unemployment leads to a low impact of unemployment insurance.
