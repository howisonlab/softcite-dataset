Apart from Equatorial Guinea, a country of less than a million people that literally struck oil, no other economy grew as much during the same period. China's growth performance is clearly spectacular and exceptional. But China's economy has reached a crossroads. The annual growth rate has slowed to about 6-7 percent since 2014 and will likely moderate further. Part of the reason for the slowdown could be cyclical, a result of a relatively weak world economy. But a major part of the reason is structural and fundamental. China's economic growth of the previous three and a half decades was based on several key factors: a sequence of market-oriented institutional reforms, including openness to international trade and direct investment, combined with low wages and a favorable demographic structure. Chinese wages are now higher than a majority of non-OECD economies. For example, China's wages are almost three times as high as India, an economy with almost the same-sized labor force. The Chinese workingage cohort has been shrinking since 2012.",

Indeed, Bai and  estimated that the returns to investment have shown signs of decline since 2008. Some productivity increase could come from reducing resource misallocation (Hsieh and Klenow 2009), which could be accomplished by further reforms in the factor and product markets, including reforms of state-owned enterprises. However, the pace of reform in the future is unlikely to be as aggressive as in the past, partly because interest groups across China now have more means to block reforms than in the past and partly because the low-hanging fruit in the area of institutional reforms has been picked. Thus, productivity growth from this source also faces a limit.",

Although state-owned enterprises have received more subsidies from the government, their performance in innovation is lackluster compared to private enterprises. Furthermore, the elasticity of patent filing or patents granted with respect to expenditures on research and development is significantly higher for private sector firms than for state-owned enterprises. We interpret these data patterns as existence of misallocations in public fiscal resources. Interestingly, we find that China's state-owned enterprises often face higher realized tax burdens (the sum of corporate income tax and value-added tax as a share of sales or value added). To improve the efficiency of resource allocation, the direction of policy reforms should perhaps put weight on leveling the playing fields for firms across all ownership types with simultaneous reductions in discretionary subsidies and taxes.",

Instead of collective farming and selling all output to a national procurement plan at a price set by the plan (usually substantially below the would-be market price), farmers were granted land user rights and allowed to sell what they produced in excess of the official quota at a market price. Agricultural production and rural incomes witnessed a dramatic increase in the ensuing years (Lin 1992). In a few years, hundreds of millions of farmers were released from their land and many started to work in factories, providing the nonfarm sector with a seemingly unlimited labor supply. In the 1980s, China's labor cost was among the lowest in developing countries, lower than in India and the Philippines and indeed lower than 114 out of 138 non-OECD economies. The vast majority of these workers were restricted to living in rural areas by the hukou system, with many working during the 1980s for township and villageowned enterprises, which were manufacturing firms located in rural areas. These enterprises provided a way for a reallocation of labor from low-productivity farm activities to higher-productivity manufacturing activities, at a time before restrictions on internal migrations were relaxed.",

The much larger drop in the number of state-owned enterprises than in their employment was part of a deliberate policy of \"grasping the large and letting go of the small\"-that is, privatizing small state-owned enterprises and consolidating bigger ones (Hsieh and Song 2015).",

Remarkably, the country avoided a big spike in the unemployment rate. The key is that the de facto privatization was accompanied by aggressive reforms to lower entry barriers faced by private sector entrepreneurs. The inefficiency of the previously centrally planned, state-dominated economic system, together with very high barriers to entry, meant huge unexplored or underexplored profitable opportunities. As a result, almost all  (CNBS 2012). This represents the largest de facto privatization program in world history in terms of the number of workers who move from state-sector to private sector employment, and one that was accomplished without massive unemployment. Through this period, the growth in the Chinese economy has become driven overwhelmingly by the growth in the private sector aided by an expansion in the number of entrepreneurs. This pattern is especially true for the manufacturing sector, which has been growing faster than either the agricultural or service sectors. Indeed, Wei and Zhang (2011b) have documented two \"70 percent rules\" using manufacturing firm census data in 1994 and 2005: First, approximately 70 percent of the growth in industrial value added came from private sector firms between these two census years. Second, approximately 70 percent of private sector growth in value added came from growth in the count of new private sector firms (the extensive margin), while the remaining 30 percent came from growth of existing firms (the intensive margin).",

For example, under the fiscal arrangement introduced in the early 1980s, local governments and the central government follow a pre-determined revenue formula (though varying across regions as a function of local bargaining power), which stimulates the incentives of local officials to create a more business-friendly environment. More generally, in spite of the political centralization by the Communist Party, the country has implemented a system of fiscal and economic decentralization that grants local governments sufficient decision-making power-and more importantly incentives-to compete with each other. The local economic growth rate is used as a key performance indicator for the career advancement of officials. The delegation of economic policy authority to local governments, which have better knowledge of local information, and competition for investment and tax base among local governments in the Chinese style of federalism have provided a useful check on the temptation of local government officials to expropriate local firms. As a result, firms acquire some de facto security of property rights, even if the formal property rights institutions are problematic (Qian and Weingast 1997; Xu 2011).",

The government was able to concentrate limited public funding to provide adequate roads, power supply, waste treatment and other infrastructure to the firms within the zones, even when it was not able to improve the infrastructure nationally at the same speed. Second, policy reforms within these zones were politically easier than doing the same things on a national scale. The success in these zones in terms of economic growth, employment, and tax revenues in turn facilitated similar market-oriented reforms outside the zones. Foreign direct investment rose rapidly in China, especially since 1992, and these zones played an important role in attracting international firms.

This less-studied factor may have a quantitatively significant effect as well. The one-child policy has yielded an unintended consequence in distorting the sex ratio in favor of boys. As the one-child generation enters the marriageable age, young men face a very competitive marriage market. In order to attract potential brides, families with sons choose to work harder, save more, and take on more risks, including exhibiting a higher propensity to be entrepreneurs (Wei and Zhang 2011a, b;Chang and Zhang 2015;Wei, Zhang, and Liu forthcoming). It is estimated that increasing marriage market competition due to sex ratio imbalances has contributed to about two percentage points of economic growth per year (Wei and Zhang 2011b).",

The logic is explained in Wei and Zhang (2011b): The extra work effort and extra risk-taking that produce a higher GDP growth rate are motivated by a desire to improve one's chance (or one's children's chance) of success in the marriage market. Yet the fraction of young men who will not get married in the aggregate is determined by the sex ratio, and not by the economy-wide work effort, risk-taking, or GDP growth rate. In this sense, the extra work effort and risk-taking are futile; households collectively would have been willing to give up this part of income growth in exchange for no sex ratio imbalance.",

But starting in 2012, China's age cohort of 15-60 started to shrink in absolute size. Policy changes to postpone the official retirement age or to encourage more female labor force participation will at best moderate the resulting decline in the workforce. Because the female labor force participation was very high under the central planning regime before the 1980s, higher than most non-Communist countries in the world, such as the United States, Japan, Germany, India, and Indonesia, the participation rate of women in the labor force has in fact come down over time. The recent relaxation of the family planning policy in November 2015 from the limit of one child per couple to two children per couple, while motivated by a desire to improve the demographic pattern for the economy, will make the dependency ratio worse for the next decade-and-a-half rather than better by adding to the number of children without altering the size of the workforce. After all, no couple can produce a 16-year old right away (Wei 2015). The sex ratio at birth started to become less unbalanced in 2009, and the contribution to growth from an unbalanced sex ratio will become weaker over time. 1",

A few features are worth noting. First, investment in physical capital has always been important for China's growth, accounting for 67.9 percent on average throughout this period. The relative share of contribution from physical investment increased to 107 percent after 2009, which resulted from the government stimulus package in response to the global financial crisis. Second, the contribution from the growth of human capital has been positive, at 12.5 percent during 1999-2008 and 16 percent during 2009-2015. Because of the outsized role of physical investment in the Chinese economy, the contribution of human capital is smaller than what one typically finds from growth decomposition for an OECD economy. Third, the growth of total factor productivity was a major contributor to GDP growth before 2008, often accounting for 20 percent or more to the total growth. (An exception was the period of 1989-1991, a time of domestic political turbulence and international sanctions.) Strikingly, the contributions from the growth of total factor productivity have turned persistently negative since 2009. 3 Upon reflection, this is perhaps not overly surprising. The Chinese government's response to the global financial crisis that started in 2008 was to encourage physical investment through an aggressive fiscal (and bank lending) program, but there were no ambitious structural reforms pursued during this period that could have raised aggregate efficiency, and yet GDP growth started to moderate after 2012-and this combination is a recipe for negative growth in total factor productivity.",

In other words, firm-level total factor productivity and the stock of patents are positively correlated. Fang, He, and Li (2016) also show a positive association between firm-level total factor productivity and patent count. They interpret this as patent innovation raising productivity; such an interpretation would need an instrumental variable approach to back it up. percent, which is essentially in the middle of the approval rates across countries. For example, the Chinese approval rate is higher than those in India and Brazil, which are close to 20 percent, but lower than those in the United States and Korea, which are in the range of 50-60 percent. Therefore, the Chinese patent approval ratio does not seem to be unusually high. Among the three types of patents (invention, utility model, and design), the fraction of approved invention patents, arguably the most technically intensive category, rose from 8 percent in 1995 to 18 percent in 2014 (column 2 of Table 2). In 2005, patents granted to foreign applicants accounted for more than 20 percent of China's total approved patents, but dropped to 7 percent in 2014, suggesting an increasing role of indigenous innovations in the Chinese economy since 2005. As Table 2 shows, both total Chinese patents filing and approvals show a rapid growth. 7 One way to consider the quality of Chinese patents is to examine patents applied by and granted to Chinese firms in other countries. As noted earlier, the rate of patents approved by China's patent office grew at an annual rate of 19 percent from 1995 to 2014. During that period, the number of patents granted to Chinese applicants by patent offices in developed countries was rising even faster at 30 percent per year (see last column in Table 2).",

            "text": "Of particular interest is a comparison of the number of patents granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to Chinese firms with those to firms from other countries. As shown in Table 3, the number of patents granted by the USPTO to Chinese corporate applicants rose from 62 in 1995 to 7,236 in 2014. The annual growth rate was 21 percent in the first half of the period (1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005) but accelerated 7 The online Appendix available with this paper at http://e-jep.org includes more detail on patent data. For example, Appendix Tables A2 and A3 provide more detail on Chinese patent filings and approvals, while Appendix Figure 3 provides more details on cross-country comparisons of patent approval rates. to 38 percent a year during the latter half of the period (2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014). Of the comparison countries-Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa, German, Japan, and Korea-only India had a similar rate of growth in corporate patents in the United States. Two natural adjustments are to consider a country's population size and income level. To this end, we run cross-country regressions with log number of patents granted to applicants from various comparison countries by the US Patent and Trademark Office as the dependent variable. As explanatory variables, we use the log of population, squared log of population, and country times year (country \u00d7 year) fixed effects. Figure 3 plots the estimated coefficients for the interaction term between county and year fixed effects for selected counties. These coefficients can be interpreted as how a given country does relative to the average international experience based on its population size. China shows steady gains in patents even with these adjustments. Of the comparison countries, India also shows gains over time after these adjustments, but Japan, Germany, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Brazil, and South Africa do not. Overall, Chinese firms collectively do better in their patent count than what the country's population size and income level would have suggested. 8",

We merge the Chinese patent database with the Annual Survey of Industrial Enterprises in China (ASIEC). The ASIEC database covers all the state-owned enterprises and private firms with sales exceeding 5 million yuan from 1998 to 2009, including ownership information. 10 The patent database contains all patents granted by China's State Intellectual Property Office between 1985 and 2012. One pattern that emerges is that state-owned enterprises in general perform worse than private firms in generating patents. During the period 1998-2009, the number of patents granted to private firms in China grew by 35 percent per year, overtaking the number of patents given to state-owned and foreign firms by a comfortable margin. The drop in the share of patents by state-owned enterprises is partly due to the shrinkage of that sector, as described earlier. In 1998, state-owned enterprises accounted for 30 percent of total firms in the ASIEC database, while they dropped to 2 percent by 2009. Clearly, private firms have become the engine of innovation in China.",

Some reckon that China has passed the so-called \"Lewis turning point,\" which means that an era of ultra-low-wage production is over (for example, Zhang, Yang, and Wang 2011). While patents are rising for both capital-and labor-intensive firms, the fraction of patents granted to labor-intensive firms increased from 55 percent in 1998 to 66 percent in 2009. Rising labor costs may have induced labor-intensive sectors to come up with more innovations to substitute for labor. 11 We can connect the discussions on total factor productivity and on innovation. We separate all firms in the ASIEC sample into those with no patents during 1998-2007, those with a cumulative patent count of 1-4 patents during the same period, and those with a cumulative count of more than 4 patents. We compute the growth of total factor productivity for each individual firm. We find that firm-level productivity tends to grow faster in the group that engages in more innovation. This suggests that to reverse China's negative levels of total factor productivity, it would be helpful for China to facilitate conditions that expand both the number of firms that engage in innovative activities and the intensity of innovation per innovating firm.",

More systematic data confirms the continued gap in innovation (Shen, Wang, and Whalley 2015). The numbers of US patents received by either Japanese, German, or Korean firms are still more than twice as many as those obtained by Chinese firms in spite of their smaller population size (as shown earlier in Table 3).

            "text": "Following China's reforms in the late 1990s, the share of state-owned enterprises in total firms dropped significantly from 24 percent in 1995 to 3 percent in 2014, as discussed earlier. However, most of the surviving state-owned enterprises are relatively big, and are in upstream industries or strategically important sectors (Hsieh and Song 2015). They are typically subject to less competition than private enterprises. Thus, China's state-owned firms both absorb nontrivial resources, including government subsidies, and still command nontrivial political weights. Part of China's move to becoming an innovative economy must be to improve the efficiency of resource allocation between state-owned and private firms. China's state-owned firms continue to receive considerable financial support from the government, including access to low-cost bank loans and research and development subsidies. In the aftermath of both the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis, the Chinese government launched stimulus packages which often involved credit expansion and which disproportionately went to state-owned enterprises. The more favorable policies and injection of massive stimulus funds have reduced the returns to capital of state-owned enterprises since 2008 (Bai and Zhang 2014), caused a decline in their total factor productivity (Wu 2013), and provided a lifeline for inefficient zombie firms (Tan, Huang, and Woo 2016). The returns to capital of state-owned enterprises are much lower than their private counterparts (Hsieh and Song 2015). Moreover, state-owned enterprises lagged behind private firms in total factor productivity (Brandt 2015). These patterns suggest a misallocation of government support between state-owned and private enterprises. Government subsidies for research and development can promote firm innovations in China (as reviewed in Boeing 2016 and confirmed by our own firm-level regressions). Government subsides can be defended on the ground that research and development by firms generate positive externalities. Indeed, most advanced countries subsidize research and development as well. The question is not whether subsidies can be justified at all, but rather whether China's allocation of such subsidies is consistent with economic efficiency.",

In comparison, the same investment by state-owned firms yields a more meager 2.2 patents. We may obtain a more informative picture by sorting firms by size and ownership.

If China finds effective ways to embrace a shift to a more innovative economy, it can realize faster its dream of moving into the high-income club. The government subsidies tend to favor state-owned firms, and yet both domestic private sector firms and foreign-invested firms are more effective in converting investment in R&D to innovation outcomes as measured by patents. One meaningful step along those lines would be for China to reduce its apparent misallocation of innovation resources by leveling the playing field for firms of all ownership types, limiting the government's discretion in subsidies for research and development, and assuring that private sector firms have a fair chance at receiving those subsidies. This will be a helpful structural reform that will complement the reforms in stronger protection of intellectual property rights and in the education system. patents granted with respect to R&D expenditures is significantly higher for private firms than for SOEs.

We vary the share from 0.4 and 0.55 and find that the broad pattern of the evolution of total factor productivity stays the same. Our finding is broadly consistent with Wu and Conference Board China Center (2014). For example, they reported negative total factor productivity from 2007 to 2012, while our estimate indicates such a decline from 2009 to 2014. One difference between their study and our growth decomposition is that they obtain a larger contribution from human capital, which may be related to the way the schooling adjustment is made.4  Fang, Lerner, and Wu (2016) provide evidence that regional variations in the strength of intellectual property rights protection in China are correlated with propensity to innovate for privatized formally state-owned firms.",
