In a sharply focused laboratory experiment, we find that many cooperators pay to report a defecting partner without the possibility of pecuniary benefit when this has the potential to deprive the latter of future gains and to help his next partner. We illustrate how a social preference can explain such costly reporting, and also discuss evidence for a role of emotions.

(2005) and Wilson (2012). about the antisocial actor with a potentially vulnerable person,\" and that \"individuals possessing more prosocial orientations are the most motivated to engage in such gossip, even at a personal cost\" (p. 1015). Such information appears to have a distinct power to grab attention, and psychological normalcy includes a desire to avoid being the subject of negative gossip. 2 Being the subject of negative reports may also have direct material consequences, if others hesitate to interact with individuals known for past reneging or defection. In modern economies, individuals can choose where to shop, which plumber to hire, and so forth. But the same mobility that puts potential cooperation partners in competition with each other threatens the reputational mechanism if a cost is entailed in spreading the word about an interaction partner's defection. If one has already decided to leave the untrustworthy partner behind and there is no incentive to encourage her to change, how will others learn whom to avoid? If all victims care only about own material payoffs, if they cannot profitably exchange the information, and if there is any cost associated with conveying it, then there will be no such reporting. 3 However, there may be nonmaterial motivations for the costly reporting of cheating or opportunistic behavior. First, engaging in negative gossip may be a direct source of satisfaction, paralleling reports that pleasure centers in the brain are activated when experimental subjects punish selfish counterparts in a trust game (de Quervain et al. 2004). Second, tipping others off not to naively cooperate with the miscreant may bring satisfaction not for the act itself but thanks to anticipation of the punishment that this may visit on that actor. The large literature showing cooperative subjects' willingness to spend money to reduce free riders' earnings in voluntary contribution experiments (Chaudhuri 2011;Falk et al. 2005;G\u00e4chter and Herrmann 2009) suggests that such motives are widespread, and raises the possibility that punitive motives might also motivate reporting. Third, conceivably the victim feels empathy or obligation towards others 2. As Adam Smith (1761) wrote: \"Man naturally \u2026 dreads, not only blame, but blame-worthiness.\"",

Rather than focusing on the decision to engage in costly reporting, however, the most closely related papers have focused on the design of reputation mechanisms or the effects of information transmission. We address this gap by conducting an experiment that investigates both the willingness to pay to report an interaction partner's uncooperativeness, and subjects' beliefs about how common that willingness is. Our experimental design, which builds on familiar prisoners' dilemma stage games, allows us to isolate the willingness to engage in reporting when a personal monetary payoff is absent, so that only desires to punish the individual, to protect her future interaction partner, or to engage in information sharing for its own sake (gossip) are potential motives for reporting. We demonstrate that reporting is significantly less common when it is costly than when free, but that costly reporting does occur often. We show cooperator-defector reporting to be far more common than cooperator-cooperator, defector-cooperator, or defector-defector reporting. Indeed, a majority of cooperators meeting defectors report them despite its cost and lack of personal benefit, in our study. We identify conditions under which such reporting, and its relative frequency across behavior pairings, is consistent with an illustrative model of social preferences, the inequity aversion model of Fehr and Schmidt (1999).",

Although reporting at positive cost is never rational for strictly selfish agents in our experiment, there exist configurations of beliefs such that the same does not apply to cooperating. We conduct an incentivized elicitation of beliefs about others' cooperation and reporting, and with the resulting data we calculate which subjects could be rationally choosing or rejecting cooperation out of simple payoff maximization, and which choose cooperation (or defection) in error or due to a social preference or emotion. Almost all observed decisions to defect in the experiment are explicable by payoff maximization under own beliefs regarding others' cooperation and reporting probabilities. Rational maximization of own payoff also explains many choices to cooperate, but a substantial number of cooperation choices require alternative explanation. In addition to social preference analysis, we keep in mind that our data on reporting, especially, are compatible with more psychological explanations, and we bring to bear evidence on the role of emotions in a final portion of our discussion.",

Experiments find that many subjects incur a cost to punish when there can be no material benefit, and that the threat of punishment can reduce or eliminate incentives to free-ride. 4 One way to understand costly punishment in such games is to see punishers as having an aversion to others free-riding or defecting while they themselves cooperate. For such individuals, imposing an earnings reduction on free riders at a monetary cost to themselves delivers 4. For example, Ertan et al. (2009), find that ex post, individual subjects earn more the more they contribute to the public good when opportunities to engage in costly punishment are available. Reviews of the literature on punishment in voluntary contribution experiments include G\u00e4chter and Herrmann (2009) and Chaudhuri (2011). a utility gain that offsets their lowered money earnings. While such punishing can be thought of as resulting from a psychological trait of negative reciprocity (Bowles and Gintis 2004;Hoffman, McCabe, and Smith 1998) perhaps linked to an emotional state of anger, it might also be rationalized or rendered mathematically tractable by a simpler framework of inequity aversion (Fehr and Schmidt 1999).",

(2016) compare dyadic private information transmission at both zero and positive cost within small populations playing a series of 36 trust games. The repeated setting here too contributes to the cost of any single reporting action being quite small, and it creates incentives to build cooperation in reporting, although reporting is much less common in their experiment when costly than when free.

(An additional costly reporting treatment conducted by strategy method is discussed later.) In each treatment, subjects play two one-shot prisoners' dilemma games, each with different, anonymous, randomly selected participants. The payoff structures of the first and second games are identical and of equal money value to end-of-session earnings. The payoff table of each round in U.S. dollars is summarized in Figure 1. 7 A key feature of our design is that subjects decide whether to play the cooperate (denoted X) or the defect (denoted Y) option in both games at the outset. Thus, in the instructions read by the participants, we write XX (YY) to represent the cooperate (defect) option, duplicating the letter choice to indicate its play in two games. In what follows (but not in the subject instructions, which avoid such terms) we refer to a subject who chooses XX (YY) as a cooperator (defector), or occasionally XX-(YY-) chooser. Committing subjects at the outset to a single choice captures the notion that people have tendencies that they carry from interaction to interaction. Adoption of this feature simplifies both analysis and reporting decisions, since it means for absence of material benefit to the reporter, in Fehr and Sutter, it is limited repetition and perfect stranger matching that has this effect in our design.",

While predictions for the PD game are the same over a wide range of payoff configurations, the degree of \"temptation\" to defect, \"fear\" of being defected on, and the potential to gain from mutual cooperation relative to mutual defection, are impacted by the specific payoff structure, so that conclusions from an experiment with one payoff configuration may not extend, behaviorally, to alternative payoffs. See, for instance, Ahn et al. (2001) and Charness et al. (2016). We made both the \"temptation\" and the \"fear\" small because we anticipated that predictions about the share of cooperators, and actual inclinations to cooperate, would thus be larger, in turn increasing reporting of defectors. that reporting, for example, a defector, can be a reliable warning about the kind of agent the next partner will encounter. Of course, we need to take into consideration that imposition of this rule affects players' strategic calculations. Accordingly, precommitment for two rounds of play should not be misconstrued as being a mechanism to force type revelation in the sense of the theoretical literature. Indeed, we will show shortly that under some beliefs, it becomes rational for a strictly self-interested agent to select XX (cooperate).",

If a player is reported, then the second-period counterpart of the reported player is told what that player chose in the first round 8 and is given the option to change his initial choice of X or Y taking into account the report he received-this being the sole exception to the rule that an initial choice is binding for two rounds of play. Subjects know that they will certainly not play the game a second time with the same counterpart, so reporting in the hope that one might oneself be the beneficiary of the information is ruled out. The counterpart will also be told whether she was reported on by her initial partner, which determines whether the player whose initial choice was reported to her is in a position to select a new action. 9 For example, consider two players, A and B. Suppose that both A and B are paired with other randomly assigned partners (not each other) in the first game. Suppose also that A chooses XX (cooperate) and B chooses YY (defect). Now imagine that B's first round partner decides to report her (B's) decision to B's second interaction partner, namely A. Since B was reported, A has a chance to change his initial choice from X to Y so as to avoid being exploited by B. A is also free to stick to the choice of X. Suppose, finally, that A (the cooperator) is not reported by his initial partner. A is thus informed that B has no opportunity to 8. That is, the computer delivers a truthful report. The potential issues of deciding whether to report truthfully and whether to believe a report that has been received are thus eliminated as concerns. We discuss the impact of this simplifying element in the conclusion. 9.

C may wish to switch to Y to exploit D, but might decide to stick with X in order to avoid feeling guilty, experiencing disutility from advantageous inequality, and so on. In the otherwise similar situation in which D can change his choice, C would have that information and would need to factor in her belief about the likelihood of D changing to Y (which may in turn be influenced by D's belief about the likelihood of C switching). 10 To check sensitivity of reporting to its cost, we vary it across treatments. A reporting cost of $1, $0.50, $0.05, and $0 is present in the high-cost (HC), mediumcost (MC), low-cost (LC), and no-cost (NC) treatments, respectively. 11 Subjects are also asked, after their own choice of XX or YY, for their beliefs about the percentage of their peers choosing XX, and-after their reporting decisions-for their beliefs about the percentages of defectors and of cooperators who will be reported. The elicited beliefs extend our ability to explore possible motivations behind subjects' decisions. So as not to raise its salience too much, we do not tell subjects about the presence of the belief elicitation tasks before they make the corresponding 10. While our design is one of finite repetition, we view the question addressed-that of lack of monetary incentive to engage in costly reporting-as relevant also to a world of indefinitely repeated interactions, since agents in such environments may also periodically need to seek new interaction partners and may avoid dealing again with an individual found to be opportunistic, but have no selfish material motive for incurring a cost to convey the information to others, especially when interacting in a population so large that inducing reciprocal reporting from others is not a plausible motive. Having only two interactions makes practical relatively large stakes in the lab for each interaction, while the fact that the report affects only one future interaction makes the motivational problem more challenging by limiting the punishment that reporting can inflict.",

Adding to this the finding that reporting is not predicted for any individual making the optimistic assumption about free second choices, we arrive at the implication that, assuming sufficient variation of belief a i not systematically linked to preference type, costly reporting should be most common in the case of cooperators meeting defectors (Case 2), with the cases of defectors meeting defectors (Case 4) and cooperators meeting cooperators (Case 1) following in that order.",

No subject participated in more than one session, and the sessions lasted about an hour on average, about half of this time being spent on reading of instructions and answering comprehension questions. The experiment was programmed in z-tree (Fischbacher 2007). All instructions (for the example of the LC treatment, see Supporting Information) were neutrally framed, avoiding terms such as \"cooperate,\" \"trust,\" and so on. Subjects had to answer a number of control questions (see the instructions) to confirm their understanding of the experiment. Communication between subjects was not permitted. Average earnings were $20.84, including a $5 participation fee, with a standard deviation of $4.16. Figure 2 summarizes key subject behaviors and beliefs, with panels (A) (at left), (B) (upper right), and (C) lower right displaying cooperation decisions, decisions to report defectors, and decisions to report cooperators, respectively.

Although we can't identify individual utility function parameters in order to predict which subjects will report their counterparts, as an exercise we estimate the proportion who would be expected to report based on conditions (3a), (3b), and (3c), and selfreported beliefs a i , b i , and c i if we assume that each subject has the same likelihood of belonging to each of the four preference types identified and assigned estimated population proportions by Fehr and Schmidt, in precisely those proportions. 21 These calculations imply that about 68.9% of the cooperators who encountered defectors, 13.5% of the cooperators who encountered cooperators, and 14.2% of the defectors who encountered defectors would engage in reporting at the costs obtaining in their treatments given their beliefs and the prevalence of each type.

See also Table 1 in Fehr and Schmidt (2010). conditions of inequalities (3a)-(3c). In Table B.8 in Appendix S2, we show estimates of simple linear regressions to predict reporting, where the independent variables are the values of the three beliefs and two treatment dummies to control for reporting cost. The regressions for Cases 1 and 4 show partial consistency with conditions (3a) and (3c) in that the belief variables b i and c i obtain positive and significant coefficients in their respective estimates. These coefficients suggest a sort of \"conditional cooperativeness\" with respect to reporting: the higher the fraction of others a subject believes report a player who behaves like her counterpart (one who cooperates, in Case 1, one who defects, in Case 4), the more likely that the subject herself pays to report. The estimate for Case 2 suggests a similar sort of conditionality: among cooperators who meet a defector, those believing that a higher share of defectors are reported are themselves more likely to report. 22 The estimated coefficients on the expected share cooperating (a i ) and on treatment dummy variables are insignificant (in one case marginally significant), however, failing to support expectations (based on conditions (3a)-(3c)) that frequency of reporting would be increasing in a i and decreasing in \u03c1. 23 H-R-SP is supported, with respect to the relationship between cost and reporting frequency, insofar as there is far more reporting at a cost of zero than at a positive cost, in general, and more reporting at zero cost than at each specific positive cost taken individually (see panels (A) and (B) of Table  B.1 in Appendix S2). 24 A finer-scale correlation between reporting cost and reporting incidence is also found insofar as subjects' self-reported 22. There have been numerous behavioral findings of tendency to perform a pro-social or cooperative act conditional on beliefs that others do so, for example, Fischbacher and G\u00e4chter (2010) for conditional contributing in public goods games and Kamei (2014) for conditional costly punishing in public goods games with punishment opportunities.",

We note that insensitivity to reporting cost within the range studied by us is consistent with Fehr and Schmidt's assumptions. Specifically, calculations show that with the frequencies of types (\u03b1 i , \u03b2 i settings, see footnote 21) assumed by those authors, little sensitivity to reporting cost is predicted within the range of our treatments. For example, calculations predict that 70% of cooperators will report a defector in both treatments LC and MC, with a drop only to 66.7% predicted to report defectors in HC. Of course, the insensitivity of reporting frequency to cost in our data may be more a quirk of small numbers than a fundamental finding. turns out to have selected YY. 26 Of the 20 subjects that participated in this strategy method session, 11 selected XX, similar to the 50% share in the MC treatment. Thanks to the set-up, we got decisions from all 11 about whether they would report if meeting a YY-chooser. Only 2 of the 11 (i.e., 18%) chose to pay the required $0.50 to report their first counterpart if that person chose YY. In the MC treatment, with the same payoffs and cost but a sequential design in which subjects first learned the actual decision of their assigned counterpart, there were nine who chose XX and learned the counterpart had chosen YY, and six of them chose to engage in costly reporting upon learning of their counterpart's action, that is, 66.7%. A two-sided twosample z test of proportions says that the 18% and 66.7% proportions are statistically significantly different from each other (p = .028). The substantial difference suggests that \"hot\" emotion (Loewenstein 2000) may have played a role in reporting in our main treatments.",

The answers to the anger question indicate that the greatest amount of anger was felt by cooperators who encountered defectors in their first interaction. Self-reported anger is always significantly less for subjects in other pairings-XX meets XX, YY meets XX, and YY meets YY. Figure 3A shows that among the cooperators who encountered defectors, average self-reported anger towards the counterpart is significantly higher (p = .04) for those who chose to report than for those who did not choose to report.
