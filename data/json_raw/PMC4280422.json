These factors are important in determining the quality of surgical care as well as long-term results of the treatment. Aim: This article focuses on the evaluation of circumferential resection margins and on the quality of mesorectal excision of middle and lower rectum tumors. In addition, laparoscopic and open techniques are compared. Material and methods: Data were collected prospectively and stored in a rectal cancer registry over a 3-year period. The parameters studied were age, sex, body mass index, localization and topography of the tumor, clinical stage, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and its response, the type of surgery, character of the circumferential and distal margins, quality of the mesorectal excision, pT and pN. Results: One hundred and twenty-five patients were chosen for our study. Laparoscopy was performed in 53 operations and a conventional approach was performed in 72 operations. Complete mesorectal excision was achieved in 54.7% of laparoscopic operations versus 44.4% in the conventional technique; partially complete excision was performed in 20.8 and 12.5%, respectively. Incomplete excisions were described in 24.5 and 43.1% (p = 0.085). Positive circumferential margin occurred during laparoscopic surgery in 11 (20.8%) patients, and in the case of conventional resection in 27 (37.5%) patients (p = 0.044). Conclusions: Our study showed comparable results between laparoscopic and open access procedures during rectal resection. The results achieved, in particular in the quality of the mesorectal excision and negative circumferential resection margin, show that the laparoscopic approach is comparable to conventional surgical techniques, with an adequate surgical outcome, in the treatment of rectal cancer.",

Without these, radical resections for rectal carcinoma cannot be evaluated [1,2]. It turns out that pathological cir-cumferential margin (pCRM) can be used as a direct indicator of oncological radicality, which significantly affects the outcome of treatment [1,3]. According to some, a positive pathological circumferential margin is a more significant independent predictive factor than the actual pT stage of the tumor [3].",

            "text": "The benefits of laparoscopic resection of the rectum, which include reduced postoperative pain and faster recovery, with both early resumption of bowel function and shortened hospitalization, are very well known and confirmed by prospective clinical studies [5,[7][8][9][10][11]. An important and strictly monitored parameter is the oncological aspects of laparoscopic procedures. When comparing the results of surgical treatment of rectal cancer, particular attention must be given to the varying anatomy and principles of surgical treatment, especially in tumors of the lower third. Unfortunately, many studies do not reflect the view of the divergent results of TME and CRM tumors above and below 10 cm from the anus. Incorporating upper rectum resections into procedures has led to an \"improvement\" in the results and thus distorted the results of many studies. It has been shown that while the prognosis of rectal cancer depends principally on the stage of disease at diagnosis, the incidence of local recurrence after resection of the rectum reflects the quality of the surgeon [8,[12][13][14][15][16]. Traction using laparoscopic instrumentation is difficult and can lead to tears in the mesorectum, which can also be the cause of the poor quality of the mesorectal excision. On the other hand, laparoscopy provides a detailed view of the pelvis and greater control over the management of the identification of the resection line, essential for the high quality of the oncologic outcome. Capnoperitoneum plays a role, which helps separate the avascular tissue layers [16,17]. The open operation is facilitated by hand traction, which does not damage fat mesorectal tissue. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that total mesorectal excision is a significant milestone in reducing local recurrence [2].",

Identifying the layers also poses problems even in thin patients. The layer of perirectal fat is low, and dissection is closer to the intestinal wall and thus to the tumor, making it difficult to prevent tearing the mesorectum [4]. The BMI difference between these two groups was evaluated in our study and showed statistical significance, probably due to the fact that patients with a lower BMI were previously operated on laparoscopically. Some studies take into account the distribution of \"internal\" fat and pelvic proportions as factors to be considered in terms of surgical tactics [18]. Also sex of the patient plays an import-ant role. A woman and a man carry the risk of injury of the mesorectum and pCRM disruption. Injury of the mesorectum can be caused by a thin fat layer, especially in the ventral part of the mesorectum in a woman. However, the combination of a narrow small pelvis with bulky mesorectal tissue in a man can be the cause of worse results of TME.",

Conversely, a difference was observed in the positivity of the pCRM in carcinoma of the lower rectum. A significantly lower number was found in the laparoscopic than in the open approach (the difference was 12.4%).

These results were probably achieved due to the high number of R0 resections (92% vs. 95%) [21]. However, the results may be affected by including in the overall group patients (12%) with tumors of the upper rectum. The difference we found between ypCRM+ after laparoscopic and conventional resection of the rectum for cancer within 10 cm (12.5% and 27.8%, respectively) was not statistically significant. There is, however, the assumption that increasing the number of patients in the study resulted in a statistically significant difference in favor of laparoscopic resection. Partial selection of the patients who are candidates for laparoscopic resection (patients with a positive response in tumor size on preoperative treatment, no tumor infiltration of surrounding organs and patients in whom bulky tumors were not found) probably affects the outcome of this study. Achieving complete mesorectal excision is very important in the case of obtaining a negative circumferential resection margin with all consequences of treatment for the patient [22].",
