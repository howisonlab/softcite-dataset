The analysis focuses on the possible effects of globalization and differences between crisis and non-crisis periods. We model the dynamics of dependencies between the series of daily returns on selected stock indices over different time periods, and compare strength of the linkages. Our tools are dynamic copula models and a formal sequential testing procedure based on the model confidence set methodology. We consider two types of dependencies: regular dependence measured by means of the conditional Spearman's rho, and dependencies in extremes quantified by the conditional tail dependence coefficients. The main result consists of a collection of rankings created for the considered subperiods, which show how the mean level of strength of the dependencies have been changing in time. The rankings obtained for Spearman's rho and tail dependencies differ, which allows us to distinguish between the results of crises and the effect of globalization.

Because of the importance of this process for risk management and macroeconomic policies, the attempts to describe and explain it form a significant part of research in many areas of finance. Among the first empirical papers dealing with this subject, the papers by Levy and Sarnat (1970) and Solnik (1974) analyzing correlations across national markets and international portfolio diversification should be mentioned. Many empirical research papers concerning the problem of market linkages arose in the 1990s (for instance, Ammer and Mei (1996), Campbell and Hamao (1992), and Pindick and Rotemberg (1993)). The sequence of financial crises that occurred at the end of the 20th century gave impact to intensive work on the subject. For instance, in 2003 a special issue of Journal of Economics and Business edited by Bailey and Choi (2003) was dedicated to the international market linkages analysis focused on the degree of financial and economic integration. The crisis of 2007-2009 further intensified the attempts to describe and explain the mechanism of the dependencies in global financial market.",

The papers consider diverse approaches and use variety of methodologies. The broad set of theories concerning the topic can be generally divided into two groups: crisiscontingent and non-crisis-contingent theories (Forbes and Rigobon 2002;Gallo and Velucchi 2009). The former explain whether cross-market linkages increase after a shock, whereas the latter assume that transmission mechanisms are always the same and that cross-market linkages do not increase after a shock. In this paper, we are not concerned with studying the related phenomena of contagion, interdependence or spillover (see, for example, Gallo and Otranto 2008) but just investigate whether and to what extent the dynamics of the linkages changes.",

For a long time the most common method applied to measure the linkages was correlation (e.g., Hamao et al. 1990; Karolyi and Stulz 1996). Next, multivariate GARCH models were used to describe the time-varying conditional correlations of global equity returns (see e.g. Capiello et al. 2006). There also exist papers using cointegration as a tool to examine the long-run equilibrium relationships between national capital markets (Bachman et al. 1996;G\u00e9rard et al. 2003). Another useful tool applied recently to describe inter-market dependencies are copulas (Jondeau and Rockinger 2006;Bartram et al. 2007;Rodriguez 2007;Chen and Poon 2007;Okimoto 2008;Chollete et al. 2009;Markwat et al. 2009).",

            "text": "To answer these questions we need an econometric measure of dependencies that is robust to specific properties of financial return series. As it was mentioned before, classic studies on interdependencies between financial returns commonly use simple, dynamic or exceedance, correlation. However, outside the world of elliptical distributions using the linear correlation is not appropriate because of possibility of quite misleading inference (Embrechts et al. 2002;McNeil et al. 2005). To avoid such problems we use copulas as a tool to describe the pattern of connections. These functions have the property to join any kind of margins into a multivariate distribution function. An advantage of the copula approach is that it allows to separate the dependence structure from the marginal distributions. By means of copulas it is also possible to model tail behavior in the joint distribution, and different kinds of asymmetry, what is of great importance in our investigation. However, in order to capture changes in the conditional dependence structure, the copula that describes it must be time varying. Time variation in the conditional copula was introduced in 2002 by Patton (2004Patton ( , 2006, and it had the form of an ARMA-type process involving the dependence parameter of the copula and a function of return innovations. Another, alternative approach, which is also applied in the present paper, may be that the model includes a number of regimes that are switched according to a Markov chain, and different copulas prevail at particular regimes (Rodriguez 2007;Markwat et al. 2009;Garcia and Tsafack 2011).",

            "text": "Modeling the dependencies between financial returns is a difficult task because of special properties of these series. Typical return series usually exhibit conditional heteroskedasticity, different types of asymmetries, and structural breaks, which strongly influence estimation results for models of the dependence structure. Moreover, the dynamics of dependencies can significantly change in time. For example, it is well documented in many studies that dependence between returns on different assets is usually stronger in bear markets than in bull markets (Ang and Bekaert 2002;Ang and Chen 2002;Patton 2004). This example of asymmetric dependence in financial markets is of great importance for portfolio choice and risk management. The main problem connected with this phenomenon is, however, that from the theoretical point of view, the mentioned asymmetry cannot be produced by a statistical model for the returns that assumes an elliptical multivariate conditional distribution, and thus applying the linear correlation is not justified. An alternative concept that allows for modeling the dependence in general situation is copula. Roughly speaking, a bivariate copula is a mapping C : [0, 1] \u00d7 [01] \u2192 [0, 1] from the unit square into the unit interval which is a distribution function with standard uniform marginal distributions.",

Formulas (12) and (13) imply that an analogous property holds for the lower and upper tail dependence coefficients. Our comparison of the mean values of the mentioned dependence measures taken in the subperiods of equal length uses the model confidence set (MCS) methodology.

For marginal distributions, we use ARMA-GARCH models. Since some of the analyzed periods are quite long and encompass periods of low and high volatility, the fitted models include asymmetric GARCH (APARCH or GJR-GARCH) with a skewed Student t distribution for the innovations \u03b5 i,t . The fitted models are sometimes fractionally integrated models but this is rather a result of possible structural breaks in the data than long memory effects (Beine and Laurent 2001). The standardized residuals\u03b5 i,t from the fitted models were routinely examined for the presence of desirable distributional and serial properties. Next, they were transformed by means of the corresponding distribution functions into the series of the form (23). The parameters of the MSC models were estimated by the maximum likelihood method, using the first summand in (24). In order to model adequately the dynamics of the linkages, we tried to use copulas from various families.

Tables 4 and 5 show the corresponding results for the linkages between the DAX and the indices FTSE, WIG20, RTS, NIKKEI, BSE 30, and KOSPI. Due to space limitations, we  Tables 2 and 3 fit well the data. The only exceptions in which a non-switching model is selected are the WIG20 (in both subperiods) and the STI. In the case of the RTS, in both subperiods one of the regimes is govern by the independence copula. The values of Spearman's rho are always higher in regimes where tail dependence is present. The results for the DAX (Tables 3 and 4) are generally similar to those for the S&P 500. There are two cases where Spearman's rhos calculated for a copula with tail dependence are lower than for the Gaussian copula. This is true for the pairs (DAX,WIG20) and (DAX, BSE 30) in the second subperiod. Usually, it is expected that during a crisis period the dependencies are stronger and that this is accompanied by an increase in tail dependence. The above examples show that the strength of regular linkages in a regime with no tail dependence can be higher than in a regime where tail dependence is present.

The first of them is the pair (S&P 500, FTSE) for which our results indicate weakening of tail dependencies in the second period. Similar results were obtained for the pairs (S&P 500, RTS), (DAX, FTSE), (DAX, WIG20), (DAX, RTS), and, with reference to upper tail dependence, for (DAX, NIKKEI) and (DAX, BSE 30). These results show that the globalization effect does not necessarily mean an increase in the strength of tail dependencies, and again that the behavior of regular dependence measured by means of Spearman's rho can be different from that of dependence in  extremes. Moreover, the rankings obtained based on the dynamics of the lower and upper tail dependence coefficients often differ from each other. The period under scrutiny includes two subperiods in which severe financial crises appeared. In years 1997-1998 the financial market experienced a turmoil starting from emerging economies, and from 2007 to 2009 it suffered from the U.S. subprime crisis. The analysis of Tables 8, 9, 12 and 13 allows one to explore the issue of increasing strength of market dependencies during the crisis periods. Although none of the analyzed subperiods can be perceived as a crisis period, a systemic increase in the strength of dependence during crises should result in a significantly higher level of dependence for periods encompassing a crisis. In the analysis we have to take into account effects of globalization, thus, for example, we do not expect the level of dependence in the period 1997-1998 to be the highest, but if there were an increase in the strength of linkages during the crisis, the level should be the highest from among those in the first four periods considered in Table 8 or in the first seven periods in Table 12. Hence our results do not, as a rule, indicate an increase in the strength of dependence during the crisis periods. The results are rather ambiguous and depend on the analyzed markets. For example, Table 8 shows that in years 1997-1998 the linkages between the S&P and the Polish WIG20 belong to the highest, but in years 2007-2009 are located among the lowest. In the case of the S&P and RTS, the scores for these two subperiods are very close. This diversity of results is observed in the case of all the considered measures of dependence.",

Thus different dynamics can result in statistically indistinguishable average levels of dependence. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, an observed increase in the strength of market linkages is due rather to the globalization, and not specifically to crises. In fact, in the considered crisis periods no general increase in dependence measured by Spearman's rho is detected. Moreover, what is even more surprising, we do not observe any systemic higher level of lower tail dependence during the crises. Another unexpected result is that for some pairs of the indices upper tail dependence turns out to be greater than the lower one. An example for this is shown in Fig. 1.

Our analysis was performed for pairs of national stock markets represented by the daily returns on stock indices including the S&P 500, DAX, FTSE, CAC 40, RTS, WIG 20, NIKKEI, STI, BSE, and BOVESPA. We considered 10 pairs containing the S&P 500, and 6 holding the DAX. The applied approach used a Markov switching copula model to describe the dynamics of dependencies during subperiods of the period 1995-2009. We considered two types of dependencies: regular dependence measured by means of the conditional Spearman's rho, and dependencies in extremes quantified by the conditional tail dependence coefficients. To compare the strength of linkages in different subperiods the Model Confidence Set methodology was applied. Our main results are the following. In the case of long subperiods (4, 7 years), a systematic and significant increase over time in the mean level of the linkages (measured by Spearman's rho) between the national stock markets is observed. This can be interpreted as an effect of globalization. On the other hand, the globalization effect does not necessarily cause a systematic increase in the strength of tail dependencies. The mean level of dependence in shorter subperiods (1-2 years) is sensitive to the market situation. In general, however, an increasing trend can be observed. Our results seem to contradict the prevailing opinion about an increase in the strength of the linkages during the crisis periods. They are also not consistent with the known belief that lower tail dependence becomes stronger in such periods.",
