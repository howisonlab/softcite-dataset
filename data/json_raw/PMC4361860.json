            "text": "Research on sex differences in renal cancer-specific mortality (RCSM), which considered the sex effect to be constant throughout life, has yielded conflicting results. This study hypothesized the sex effect may be modified by age, which is a proxy for hormonal status. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (1988-2010) were used to identify 114,539 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The study cohort was divided into three age groups using cutoffs of 42 and 58 years, which represent the premenopausal and postmenopausal periods. The cumulative incidence function and competing risks analyses were used to examine the effect of covariates on RCSM and other-cause mortality (OCM). In premenopausal period, male sex was a significant predictor of poor RCSM for both localized (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [aSHR] 5 1.63, P 5 0.002) and advanced (aSHR 5 1.20, P 5 0.041) disease. In postmenopausal period, the sex disparity diminished (aSHR 5 1.05, P 5 0.16) and reversed (aSHR 5 0.95, P 5 0.017) in localized and advanced disease, respectively. On the contrary, similar trend was not found for OCM across all age groups. Our results demonstrated the sex effect on RCSM was strongly modified by age. These findings may aid in clinical practice and need further evaluation of underlying biological mechanisms. R enal cancer is the 13th most common malignancy globally, and it has increased by about 2% annually during the last two decades 1. In 2013, an estimated 65,150 new cases of renal cancer were diagnosed in the United States and 13,680 died of the disease 2. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for approximately 90% of all renal malignancies, represented 5% of all cancers in men and 3% of all cancers in women in the United States in 2013 2,3. Overall, the incidence of RCC is about 1.6 to 2.0 times higher in men than women, and men account for almost two thirds of all deaths from RCC 2-4. Current evidence suggests that the protective role of sex in the incidence of RCC may extend to mortality. Results from a multi-institutional sample of 6234 patients with RCC found significant sex differences in outcomes, with women having better disease-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR] 5 0.75) and overall survival (HR 5 0.80) compared with men 5. Rampersaud et al. 6 , who studied 5654 RCC patients treated at 10 international academic centers, reported that women had a 19% reduced risk of death compared with men (HR 5 0.81). The observed female survival advantage is also supported by biological research. Among all plausible contributing factors, estrogen is most commonly discussed 7-10. A study by Yu et al. 7 found that estrogen, through estrogen receptor (ER) b, inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of RCC cells and increased RCC apoptosis by affecting the expression of growth factor-related downstream genes and apoptotic genes. Nevertheless, other epidemiological studies have failed to support a sex effect on RCC-specific survival 4,11. It should be noted that the peak incidence of RCC occurs in the sixth and seventh decades, during which sex difference in hormones decrease. Therefore, the age-associated changes in sex hormones may be one reason for the conflicting results of sex and survival outcomes. In the current study, we hypothesized that the effect of sex on oncologic outcomes is modified by age, which was used as a surrogate for hormone status. To test our hypothesis, we examined the sex effect across age categories on renal cancer-specific mortality (RCSM) in patients with RCC from the population-based Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Moreover, since other-cause mortality (OCM) accounts for",

Younger and older patients were similar in terms of registry area, SES, tumor size, and the percentage of clear cell RCC. However, young patients were likely to be black, have localized disease and low-grade disease, and to have undergone surgical interventions, compared with older patients. Sex comparisons revealed that more older men were married (74.16%) whereas more older women were unmarried (48.91%). Moreover, pathological subtypes of RCC showed a predominance of chromophobe (9.25%) and a lower probability of papillary (4.78%) in young women. Sex differences in tumor size and SEER stage, which may be influenced by the prevalence of early detection, were small across the different age groups (Table 1).",

Some found a significant female advantage, with HRs ranging from 0.75 to 0.81 5,6,12,13 ; however, these observations were not repeated in other large studies 4,11 . Research on other pathophysiological conditions indicates that the estrogen axis is one of the most plausible mechanisms of the female advantage 7,[14][15][16] . Unfortunately, the abovementioned studies examined the sex effect without considering age-related changes in estrogen levels. A recent study by Rampersaud et al. 6 , which investigated the effect of age on RCC-specific survival between sexes, reported: (a) that age was an independent predictor of RCC-specific survival in women, but not in men; and (b) that the survival advantage for women was only present in patients younger than 58 years old. These results, for the first time, indicated a different trajectory of age-related mortality between sexes. However, that study did not make in-depth comparisons between sexes across age. The current study, to some extent, overcomes the limitation regarding the sex effect on RCSM. Prespecified age cutoffs divided the patient population into three groups, so that most of the upper and lower tertiary groups were homogeneous in menopausal status. The sex effect was demonstrated using stringent methodology that included multivariate analyses and competing models.",

Based on our findings, we speculate that the survival advantage in young, premenopausal women may be conferred by the estrogen axis. The protective effect of the estrogen axis on survival has been observed in other cancers, such as colorectal cancer 17,18 . Previous biological research has demonstrated that the estrogen-ERb axis may play an important role in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of RCC cells 7 . Therefore, a rich circulation of estrogen may enhance the tumor suppressor function of ERb. Moreover, the expression of ERb may be different in premenopausal and postmenopausal kidneys. Esqueda et al. 19 found that the expression of ERb was significantly decreased after ovariectomy. Therefore, a synchronized increasing expression of ERb and estrogen may play a vital role in RCC among premenopausal women.",

First, the lack of specific indicators of hormonal status, such as information on menopausal status, use of oral contraceptives, or hormone replacement therapy, prohibit a more direct evaluation of their effect and limit our conclusions. Second, comorbidities was not included in multivariate analyses due to comorbidities data on patients younger than 65 years were not available in SEER and linked database. However, our results showed that OCM, a probability intimately related to comorbidities, remain in favor of female in all age groups, which is in contrast to the diminished female advantage in RCSM from premenopausal to postmenopausal period. Another supporting evidence was found in advanced disease: we observed similar trend of RCSM from premenopausal to postmenopausal period, while OCM between sexes was similar in young patients and in favor of female in elderly patients  ( Figure 2). Therefore, it is highly likely that other age related imbalanced factors account for the changing trend of sex disparity in RCSM. Third, the current study only included patients with de novo advanced RCC. Whether the phenomenon will be attenuated in patients with recurrent systematic disease is an interesting question that warrants further investigation. Finally, there are some uncertainties in the accuracy of 'SEER cause-specific death classification' although results from published studies have confirmed the concordance between cause-specific death recorded in SEER database and the underlying cause of death 22,23 .",

Family socioeconomic status (SES) was determined by four variables: median family income, the percentage of individuals living below the poverty line, the percentage of individuals unemployed, and the percentage of individuals without a bachelor's degree.

We also assessed the effect required of a hypothetical unmeasured binary factor to explain the observed SHR of sex using sensitivity analysis. All the analyses were stratified by localized disease and regional/distant disease, because OCM makes a substantial contribution to deaths in localized disease, whereas RCSM accounts for the majority of deaths in regional/ distant disease.
