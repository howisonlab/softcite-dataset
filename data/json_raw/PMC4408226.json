            "text": "Skin permeability is widely considered to be mechanistically implicated in chemically-induced skin sensitization. Although many chemicals have been identified as skin sensitizers, there have been very few reports analyzing the relationships between molecular structure and skin permeability of sensitizers and non-sensitizers. The goals of this study were to: (i) compile, curate, and integrate the largest publicly available dataset of chemicals studied for their skin permeability; (ii) develop and rigorously validate QSAR models to predict skin permeability; and (iii) explore the complex relationships between skin sensitization and skin permeability. Based on the largest publicly available dataset compiled in this study, we found no overall correlation between skin permeability and skin sensitization. In addition, cross-species correlation coefficient between human and rodent permeability data was found to be as low as R 2 =0.44. Human skin permeability models based on the random forest method have been developed and validated using OECDcompliant QSAR modeling workflow. Their external accuracy was high (Q 2 ext = 0.73 for 63% of external compounds inside the applicability domain). The extended analysis using both experimentally-measured and QSAR-imputed data still confirmed the absence of any overall",

Skin permeability is also often considered as a potential parameter affecting chemicals' sensitization potential (MacKay et al., 2013). It relates to the ability of a molecule to pass through the skin, a characteristic which is primarily influenced by the physicochemical properties of the chemical as well as the physicochemical and biological properties of the membrane (Xia, 2011).",

            "text": "Despite the high importance of skin permeability for consumer product efficacy and its supposed influence on potential toxicities such as skin sensitization, the amount of experimental data available in the public domain is surprisingly limited. In the early 90's, a compilation of data points for skin permeability gathered from several sources was published (Flynn, 1990). Subsequent studies added some complementary data allowing researchers to develop Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models for predicting skin permeability. However, as shown in Table S1, most of the published studies reporting on skin permeability modeling (Abraham et al., 1999;Barratt, 1995;Berge, 2009;Chen et al., 2010Chen et al., , 2007Cronin et al., 1999;Host\u00fdnek and Magee, 1997;Lien and Gao, 1995;Magnusson et al., 2004;Moss and Cronin, 2002;Moss et al., 2011;Patel et al., 2002;Guy, 1995, 1992) have not included certain critical elements of QSAR model development and validation protocol, such as the definition of the applicability domain (AD) or proof of passing the Y-randomization test, which constitute best practices of QSAR modeling (OECD, 2004;Tropsha, 2010). Recently, several QSAR studies were benchmarked on a series of 11 compounds and all of them failed to predict skin permeation quantitatively; they were only able to rank permeants (Brown et al., 2012). Another recent study showed that most of the available QSAR models underestimate the skin permeability of hydrophilic solutes (Chen et al., 2013). Recent studies (Chauhan and Shakya, 2010) attempted to overcome the related problems with complex chemical mixtures and built a QSAR model based on several mixtures of 36 chemicals with porcine skin data. The latter model followed the best practices of QSAR modeling (Tropsha, 2010); however, we have identified 21 duplicative structures in that dataset (see Table S3) indicating a potential bias of the model and a likely over-estimation of its true performance.",

The prevalence of dermal exposure to diverse chemicals in consumer products and in the environment, the importance of permeability for skin sensitization, and the lack of reliable models to predict these endpoints for new chemicals have motivated us to initiate a tandem study on collecting and analyzing both skin permeability and skin sensitization data. In the companion paper (Alves et al., 2014), we have reported on new QSAR models of skin sensitization. In this study, we have compiled, curated, and integrated skin permeability coefficient (Kp) data extracted from various literature sources. Using this unique data collection, we have developed and rigorously validated QSAR models for skin permeability, and explored the relationships between the skin sensitization potential and the chemical permeability coefficient. The QSAR models developed in this and the accompanying study (Alves et al., 2014) are publicly available and can be used for evaluating chemically induced skin effects in silico as part of both research and development projects as well as in support of regulatory decisions on consumer products.",

Chemicals were removed if their structures could not be found. Each dataset was carefully curated according to previously established guidelines (Fourches et al., 2010). Briefly, counterions were removed, whereas specific chemotypes such as aromatic and nitro groups were normalized using the ChemAxon Standardizer (v.5.3, ChemAxon, Budapest, Hungary, http://www.chemaxon.com). The presence of duplicates, i.e., identical compounds reported more than once in the same dataset, is known to lead to over-optimistic estimations of the predictivity for developed QSAR models. However, the analysis of such records also gives an estimate of the dataset quality: if activity data for the same compound are consistent, the overall data quality is high; if there is a large deviation in experimental values between different records of the same compound, the quality is, obviously, low. Thus, after the structural standardization, the duplicates were identified using ISIDA Duplicates (Varnek et al., 2008) and HiT QSAR (Kuz'min et al., 2008) software and carefully analyzed. If the experimental properties associated with two duplicative structures were identical, or highly similar, then one compound was chosen at random and deleted. However, if their experimental properties were significantly different, we deleted both records from the dataset. During the curation of human skin permeability dataset, we found 17 pairs of duplicate structures and two sets of triplicates as shown in Table S3. The permeability values for duplicative records were almost identical (logKp variation ~ 0.01 LU) except those for butanoic acid that had a variation higher than ca. 0.4 LU. Thus, the LogKp value for all 17 compounds was averaged and the duplicative records were removed so that only one permeability coefficient was used for a chemical compound.",

In this study, we have employed the Sequential Agglomerative Hierarchical Non-overlapping (SAHN) method implemented in the ISIDA/Cluster program (http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr) (Varnek et al., 2007). Briefly, each compound represents one cluster at the start. Then, the m compounds are merged iteratively into clusters using their pairwise Euclidean distances stored in a squared (m * m) symmetric distance matrix. The two closest objects (molecules or clusters) are iteratively identified and merged to form a new cluster, the distance matrix being updated with the re-computed distances separating the newly formed cluster and the others, according to the user-specified type of linkage (complete linkage in this study). The process is repeated until one cluster remains. The parent-child relationships between clusters result in a hierarchical data representation, or dendrogram. In particular, we used ISIDA/Cluster to obtain the heat map (see Results section) of the proximity matrix.",

At the 2D level, the connectivity of atoms in a simplex, atom type, and bond nature (single, double, triple, or aromatic) have been considered. SiRMS descriptors account not only for the atom type, but also for other atomic characteristics that may impact biological activity of molecules, e.g., partial charge, lipophilicity, refraction, and an atom ability for being a donor/acceptor in hydrogen-bond formation (H-bond). For atom characteristics with continuous values (charge, lipophilicity, and refraction) the division of the entire value range into definite discrete groups has been carried out. The atoms have been divided into four groups corresponding to their (i) partial charge A\u2264\u22120.05<B\u22640<C\u22640.05<D, (ii) lipophilicity A\u2264\u22120.5<B\u22640<C\u22640.5<D, and (iii) refraction A\u22641.5<B\u22643<C\u22648<D. For H-bond characteristic, the atoms have been divided into three groups: A (acceptor of hydrogen in H-bond), D (donor of hydrogen in H-bond), and I (indifferent atom). The usage of sundry variants of differentiation of simplex vertexes (atoms) represents the principal feature of the SiRMS approach (Kuz'min et al., 2007). Detailed description of HiT QSAR and SiRMS can be found elsewhere (Kuz'min et al., 2008;Muratov et al., 2010).",

Here we followed a 5-fold external cross-validation procedure: the full set of compounds with known experimental activity is randomly divided into five subsets of equal size; then one of these subsets (20% of all compounds) is set aside as an external validation set and the remaining four sets together form the modeling set (80% of the full set). This procedure is repeated five times allowing each of the five subsets to be used as external validation set. Models are built using the modeling set only, and it is important to emphasize that the compounds in corresponding external set (fold) are never employed either to build and/or select the models.

RF is an ensemble of single decision trees. Outputs of all trees are aggregated to obtain one final prediction. Each tree is grown as follows: (i) a bootstrap sample is produced from the whole set of N compounds to form a training set for the current tree. Compounds that are not in the training set of the current tree are placed in the out-of-bag (OOB) set (size of ~ N/3); (ii) the best split by CART algorithm (Breiman et al., 1984) among the m randomly selected descriptors from the entire pool in each node is chosen; (iii) each tree is then grown to the largest possible extent; there is no pruning. The predicted classification values are defined by majority voting for one of the classes. Thus, each tree predicts values for only those compounds that are not included in the training set of that tree (for OOB set only). Since RF possesses its own reliable statistical characteristics (based on OOB set prediction) which could be used for validation and model selection, no cross-validation was performed (Breiman, 2001). Thus, the final model is chosen by the lowest error for prediction of the OOB set. The local (tree) applicability domain approach (Artemenko et al., 2011) was used for all RF models developed in this study. where K o/w is the octanol/water partition coefficient and MW is the molecular weight of the chemical.

            "text": "We have explored whether there are intrinsic relationships between skin sensitization and skin permeability of chemicals. Since rodent data did not correlate well with human data, only human skin permeability data were employed for this analysis. We identified a subset of 20 compounds for which both skin sensitization and skin permeability data were known. These experimental data were compiled from several studies (Chauhan and Shakya, 2010;ICCVAM, 2009;Jaworska et al., 2011). As shown in Table 2, there is no direct relationship between the two endpoints. The ranges of logKp values for sensitizers (logKp = \u22123.62 -\u22121.28) vs. non-sensitizers (logKp = \u22123.05 -\u22121.6) confirm this finding. For instance, five non-sensitizers have low permeability coefficient while logKp values for two other nonsensitizers are high. There is a common understanding that a chemical should penetrate the skin to cause sensitization (penetration is generally regarded as the first step in the skin sensitization AOP (Karlberg et al., 2008;OECD, 2012)). However, we found examples when a relatively weak penetrant can still be a strong sensitizer (e.g., p-Phenylenediamine, logKp = \u22123.62), whereas a strong penetrant, can be a non-sensitizer (e.g., octanoic acid, logKp = \u22121.60). This observation suggests that skin permeability and skin sensitization are generally decoupled processes and therefore it may be possible to modify chemicals such as to affect permeability without affecting sensitization, and vice versa.",

Short-chain alcohols have similar logKp values (ca. \u22123.0) except for ethylene glycol (logKp = \u22124.07). For glycol ethers with short carbon chains (cluster b in Figure 2), the decrease of permeability is likely related to the chain length (2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol (logKp= \u22123.69) < 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol (logKp= \u22123.88) < 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol) (logKp= \u22124.45). To confirm this tendency, we have calculated permeability for two additional glycol ethers. We found that 2-(2-propoxyethoxy)ethanol (logKp pred = \u22124.05), which had an logKppred intermediary between 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol and 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol, followed the trend but our predictions indicated a slight increase in permeability for 2-(2-(pentyloxy)ethoxy)ethanol (logKp pred = \u22123.95). Then, with further increase of the chain length, this effect reached saturation resulting in a highly similar permeability for the next three compounds: 2-(2-(hexyloxy)ethoxy)ethanol (logKp pred = \u22123.88), 2-(2-(heptyloxy)ethoxy)ethanol (logKp pred = \u22123.87), and 2-(2-(octyloxy)ethoxy)ethanol (logKp pred \u22123.89).

            "text": "As a result of cluster analysis, we found three compounds that had different activity annotations from the rest of the cluster members and were therefore suspicious. These compounds included a barbiturate (amylobarbital) and two steroid derivatives of hydrocortisone (hydrocortisone methylsuccinate, and hydrocortisone succinamate). Our procedure for evaluating suspicious compounds was based on the permeability prediction for these compounds using developed models and a search for additional experimental data to verify their human skin permeability coefficients. Unfortunately, we were unable to find any confirmatory data in the literature to prove or refute the values of permeability coefficients for these substances. According to our consensus model 5, amylobarbital had a predicted logKp = \u22123.56 (experimental logKp= \u22122.64) similar to other barbitals: barbital (logKp = \u22123.95), phenobarbital (logKp = \u22123.34), and butobarbital (logKp = \u22123.71), which made us less confident in the accuracy of the reported permeability of this compound. Within steroids (cluster c in Figure 2), progesterone was the strongest penetrant (logKp = \u22121.89), whereas the addition of one hydroxyl group in position 17 of the steroid scaffold significantly decreased the permeability (hydroxyprogesterone logKp = \u22123.22). The hydroxyl group in position 17 appears to be bad for steroid permeability, since testosterone (logKp = \u22123.40) contains the hydroxyl group but lacks the ethoxy group. We removed both hydroxyl and ethoxy group from position 17, and the resulting compound, 3-oxo-delta4-steroid, had a predicted logKp pred = \u22122.28; adding a methyl group to the same position resulted in a logKp pred = \u22122.28, which was higher than the permeability of hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone, but lower than that of progesterone. The presence of other substituents and positions of double bonds seemed to be less important. The effects of the substituent in position 21 on compound permeability seem to depend on its size: it decreases when a methyl substituent (methylsuccinate; logKp = \u22123.68) is replaced by a larger group (succinamate substituent; logKp = \u22124.59) but dramatically increases as shown in the four hydrocortisone derivatives (hydrocortisone hexanoate, hydrocortisone octanoate, hydrocortisone methylpimelate, and hydrocortisone hemipimelate) that have a long chain in this position (see Table S4). In the beginning of the homological series of compounds, the permeability of carboxylic acids (cluster a in Figure  2) increased proportionally to the length of the hydrocarbon chain, i.e., acetic acid (logKp = \u22123.21) < propionic acid (logKp = \u22122.74) < butanoic acid (logKp = \u22122.90) < pentanoic acid (logKp = \u22122.70) < hexanoic acid (logKp = \u22121.85) < heptanoic acid (logKp = \u22121.70) < octanoic acid (logKp = \u22121.60). Then, similarly to glycol ethers from cluster b, the effect reached saturation and predicted logKp values for five next carboxylic acids became very similar: nonanoic acid (logKp pred = \u22121.68), decanoic acid (logKp pred = \u22121.68), undecanoic acid (logKp pred = \u22121.71), dodecanoic acid (logKp pred = \u22121.82), and tridecanoic acid (logKp pred = \u22121.84).",

For this reason, we decided to compare our models with that implemented in this software. DERMWIN uses a linear equation that relates the permeability coefficient with the chemical's octanol/water partition coefficient and molecular weight. However, statistical characteristics of this model suggested that this correlation was not adequate to predict human permeability. Although our consensus model 12 had a lower coverage of chemical space than DERMWIN (77% vs. 100%), it significantly outperformed DERMWIN in predictivity (Q 2 ext = 72% vs. 43%, respectively) (see Table 1). When the AD restriction was removed and the predictive accuracy of the models was evaluated using the same set of compounds (143 compounds), the comparison was in favor of our model (Q 2 ext = 71% vs. 66%, respectively) (see Table 3).",

Although the overall correlation between skin permeability measured in these two species was not high, we wished to determine whether the model obtained on rodent dataset E could be used to predict skin permeability in humans. Virtual screening of the human dataset D using the model developed with the rodent data resulted in a reasonably high predictivity (Q 2 ext = 0.77, RMSE = 1.27) but only for a very small fraction (19%) of compounds. Based on these results, one can assume that the rodent model could be used for predicting human skin permeability for at least some compounds within the conservative AD, but this observation should be considered with caution since it does not hold true for a larger data set. Additional experimental results for greater number of compounds are needed for more definitive conclusions.",

The use of QSAR-imputed permeability and sensitization data allowed us to examine the possible relationships between the two endpoints for a much larger set of compounds. Skin sensitization model 5 (see the companion paper (Alves et al., 2014)) was used for predicting skin sensitization for 186 compounds in the human skin permeability dataset (D), whereas skin permeability model 5 (Table 1) was used for calculating permeability coefficients for 387 compounds in the skin sensitization dataset retrieved from ICCVAM (254 compounds from dataset A + 133 sensitizers from dataset B) (see (Alves et al., 2014)). Then, we combined all predictions for compounds with unavailable experimental data (see Table S5). Compounds outside of AD either for model 5 or 12 were removed from the analysis. In the end, 283 compounds that had information (experimental or predicted) for both endpoints were considered for the analysis. As one can see in Figure S1, all but one of the weakest penetrants (logKp < \u22125) were non-sensitizers. The only exception was 1-dodecyl glycidyl ether, which could have been mispredicted by model 5. It was hypothesized recently that compound accumulation in the skin is contributing more significantly to skin sensitization than its actual permeability through the skin layer (Jaworska et al., 2013). Our results (see Figure S1) show that easily-penetrating compounds may be both sensitizers and non-sensitizers. For compounds with low permeability we made the same observation. These findings re-confirm the absence of the global correlation between skin permeability and sensitization.",

Careful analysis of the relationships between the two endpoints within clusters of structurally similar compounds showed that the observation linking the high permeability and skin sensitization potential could be made only for one cluster out of 34. This specific Cluster 1 is formed by 11 compounds represented by four barbitals (barbital, amylobarbital, butobarbital, and phenobarbital) and seven other drugs (scopolamine, ibuprofen, atropine, griseofulvin, cyclamen aldehyde, p-tert-butyl-alphaethyl-hydrocinnamal, and sodium-3,3,5-trimethyl-benzenesulfonate). The comparison between permeability and sensitization for compounds in this cluster is shown in Figure S2 and Table S6.

Similarly, in another recent study (Jaworska et al., 2013) the authors hypothesizes that the accumulation of a chemical in the epidermis layer of the skin is much more related to the skin sensitization than the actual penetration properties. In another study (Roberts and Patlewicz, 2010), it was hypothesized that skin sensitizers reach the viable epidermis by-passing skin permeability route via shunt pathways, since bad penetrants have shown to be sensitizers when applied by intradermal injection.",
