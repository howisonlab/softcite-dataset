            "text": "This study demonstrates the prevalence, phylogenetic diversity, and physiology of nitrate-reducing microorganisms capable of utilizing reduced humic acids (HA) as electron donors in agricultural soils. Most probable number (MPN) enumeration of agricultural soils revealed large populations (10 4 to 10 6 cells g \u060a1 soil) of microorganisms capable of reducing nitrate while oxidizing the reduced HA analog 2,6-anthrahydroquinone disulfonate (AH 2 DS) to its corresponding quinone. Nitratedependent HA-oxidizing organisms isolated from agricultural soils were phylogenetically diverse and included members of the Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. Advective up-flow columns inoculated with corn plot soil and amended with reduced HA and nitrate supported both HA oxidation and enhanced nitrate reduction relative to no-donor or oxidized HA controls. The additional electron donating capacity of reduced HA could reasonably be attributed to the oxidation of reduced functional groups. Subsequent 16S rRNA gene-based high-density oligonucleotide microarray (PhyloChip) indicated that reduced HA columns supported the development of a bacterial community enriched with members of the Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, and Betaproteobacteria relative to the no-donor control and initial inoculum. This study identifies a previously unrecognized role for HA in stimulating denitrification processes in saturated soil systems. Furthermore, this study indicates that reduced humic acids impact soil geochemistry and the indigenous bacterial community composition. IMPORTANCE This study identifies a new metabolic capacity in soil microbial communities that may be responsible for the mediation of significant nitrogen losses from soil systems. Nitrate-dependent humic acid (HA)-oxidizing organisms isolated from agricultural soils were phylogenetically diverse and included members of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. Advective up-flow columns inoculated with corn plot soil and amended with reduced HA and nitrate supported both HA oxidation and enhanced nitrate reduction relative to no-donor or oxidized HA controls. The additional electron donating capacity of reduced HA could reasonably be attributed to the oxidation of reduced functional groups."

However, reduced redox-active functional groups within HA can be readily oxidized as electron donors for bacterial respiration (20,21). The hydroquinone content of reduced HA are considered important humus-borne electron donors of this type, and microbial oxidation of hydroquinones to corresponding quinones has been demonstrated to support nitrate, perchlorate, arsenate, and selenate reduction (20,21,(27)(28)(29). Microbial hydroquinone oxidation has been most clearly demonstrated with the model compound 2,6anthrahydroquinone disulfonate (AH 2 DS), which can be oxidized to its quinone form 2,6-anthraquinone disulfonate (AQDS). To date, all tested AH 2 DS-oxidizing bacteria have alternatively utilized reduced HA, suggesting that AH 2 DS is a good model for investigating HA-oxidizing microbiology (21).",

Our culture-dependent studies revealed the existence of a large and diverse population of NHOx and provided several novel isolates. NHOx populations coupled the oxidation of reduced HA to substantial nitrate reduction in advective flow columns. A 16S rRNA gene-based high-density oligonucleotide microarray (Phy-loChip) (30) illustrated a phylogenetic response, with specific taxa enriched exlusively in HA-amended soils relative to control and background treatments. Together, the results presented in this article demonstrate that NHOx are prevalent in agricultural soils and may play an important role in nitrate respiration.",

During the initial 7-day equilibration period, limited nitrate reduction occurred in all columns in the absence of electron donor amendment, suggesting the presence of an electron donor intrinsic to the soil. After equilibration, the columns were continuously injected at port A with electron acceptor medium containing approximately 0.5 mM nitrate.

Similarly to the donor-free column, there was a minimal nitrate gradient along the length of the column by the end of the operation (124, 105, 110, and 122 M for ports 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively), suggesting that the majority of the microbial nitrate reduction was limited to the area between the injection ports and sampling port 1.

Fe(III) backtitration revealed that the oxidized HA medium contained a moderate amount of reduced functionalities amounting to 448.7 \u03ee 37.8 reducing microequivalents (Eq). Reducing equivalents were also detected in samples collected from the oxidized HA columns at ports 1 and 4 ( Fig. 3a). Over time, the column community was capable of more rapidly oxidizing introduced HA microequivalents ( Fig. 3a). By the end of the experimental time period, essentially all reduced microequivalents were oxidized immediately at port 1, suggesting development of a HA-oxidizing community colocalized with the most active zone of apparent nitrate reduction near the point of donor medium injection.

Assuming complete reduction of nitrate to N 2 (5-electron transfer), the extent of HA oxidation accounts for approximately 40% of the total nitrate reduction observed in the reduced HA column, suggesting that HA oxidation was a significant nitrate reduction driver in the experimental system. (v) Electron balance. As illustrated in the no-donor control column and calculated for HA-treated columns, donor species intrinsic to soil as well as potential degradation of HA or HAassociated organics, supported nitrate reduction in each column system. Nevertheless, the presence of reduced HA functionalities increased the nitrate reduction capacity of column systems, accounting for up to 40% of total observed respiratory activity. The difference in nitrate reduction between oxidized and reduced column treatments (211 M to 135 M) is approximately 76 M, corresponding to 380 Eq of additional electron transfer, assuming production of dinitrogen gas. The additional reduced functionalities in the reduced HA treatment relative to the oxidized treatment (approximately 303 Eq accounting for dilution) therefore accounts for approximately 80% of the additional nitrate reduction observed. This correlation implies that the additional electron donating capacity of the reduced HA treatment can be attributed to the enhanced content of reduced functional groups.",

Similar ubiquity and diversity of NHOx populations were observed in this study which utilized source soils collected from a limited geographical area and differing only in plant cover or fertilizer treatment. The populations of NHOx observed in this study varied between 10 4 cells g \u03ea1 soil (native grassland soil) and 10 6 cells g \u03ea1 soil (forest and corn plot soil). Notably, MPN-based studies of heterotrophic nitrate-reducing bacteria in agricultural soils routinely reveal populations between 10 4 and 10 6 cells g \u03ea1 soil, in the same log range as the MPN analysis performed here (32,33). Although total heterotrophic nitratereducing bacterial populations were not enumerated in this study, it is plausible that a significant portion of culturable nitraterespiring organisms present in agricultural soils are capable of HA oxidation. Many of the isolates in this study were members of the Alcaligenes or Pseudomonas genera, which have routinely been isolated as denitrifying organisms from agricultural and rhizosphere soils (1,32,34).

The presence of reduced functional groups increased the electron donating capacity of HA, and the reduced functional group content roughly correlated with the difference in oxidation state between similar HA treatments. However, addition of either HA always supported a greater extent of nitrate reduction than would be expected based solely upon oxidation of the reduced functional group content alone. This discrepancy persists when electron donors intrinsic to the soil were accounted for in no-donor control systems. One potential explanation for this observation is microbial degradation of HA or HA-associated organics. Enhanced denitrification in response to humic amendments has been illustrated for soils and wetland or riverbed sediments (7,14,35,36). These studies did not generally discriminate between degradative oxidation of humic materials and nondegradative oxidation of reduced functional groups.

However, it is well documented that isolated members of the Acidobacteria are capable of both oxidation and reduction of quinone moieties (20), which suggests a physiological role in HA redox reactions for the Acidobacteria in these HAamended columns.

Correspondingly, a majority of the bacteria isolated as part of this study supported this finding, with seven of the NHOx isolates belonging to the Betaproteobacteria within the order Burkholderiales. Two of our isolates were closely related to Ralstonia sp., and five isolates were most closely related to Achromobacter sp. Further supporting our findings based on pure culture and community results, a recent study also identified the dominance of 16S rRNA gene sequences from the Burkholderiales, Ralstonia, and Cupriavidus spp. in reduced HA biofilms but not detected in controls not treated with humic acid (38).",

To characterize changes in the bacterial community after humic acid treatment, DNA was extracted from the initial inoculum and from port 1 of each of three columns (no donor, oxidized HA, and reduced HA). Due to the high humic content of the soil, the previously described extraction protocol (31) was modified to increase DNA quality and yields. Specifically, 50 l of 0.1 M aluminum ammonium sulfate was added as flocculent to the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extraction buffer to minimize coextraction of humic acid material, and nucleic acids were precipitated for two hours at room temperature with polyethylene glycol (PEG) rather than isopropanol (31). Extractions three times for each soil sample with pellets from each sample combined and resuspended in 100 l of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. Coextraction of humic material in samples from the HA-treated columns resulted in brown resuspended DNA that failed to amplify by PCR. To remove humic substance contamination from the DNA, all the resuspended DNA samples were purified using the MoBio Power Soil DNA kit according to the manufacturer's protocol apart from the fact that the samples were gently mixed rather than beadbeated or vortexed. DNA quality and quantification were assessed by gel visualization. PCR amplification was conducted as previously described (Wrighton et al. [31]); the amplifications over a gradient using 8 different annealing temperatures and nondegenerate primers and were restricted to 25 cycles to minimize PCR bias. The amount of PCR product loaded onto the chips, target fragmentation, biotin labeling, PhyloChip hybridization, scanning, and staining, as well as background subtraction, noise calculation, and detection and quantification criteria were based on the protocol given in reference 30.",

For bacterial richness, a taxon was considered present in the sample when 90% or more of its assigned probe pairs for its corresponding probe set were positive (positive fraction of \u05460.90). To determine the differences in bacterial community composition, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was performed on PhyloChip hybridization data using the statistical package Primer V (Plymouth Marine Laboratory, Plymouth, United Kingdom). To discriminate the bacterial populations enriched in the humic acid-treated columns, a subtractive analysis between the controls and humic acid-treated columns was performed."

The sequences were aligned with MUSCLE 3.6 (Edgar), and phylogenetic analysis was performed with RAxML (Stamatakis). 16S rRNA sequences of previously isolated humic substanceoxidizing and -reducing bacteria and the bacteria characterized as part of this study (numbered isolates 8 to 14, 23, 24, and 26) are also included in the phylogenetic analyses and resulting tree. Isolate sequences are numbered as follows (accession numbers are given in the parentheses; all accession numbers are for the GenBank databank, except for accession numbers beginning with NC_, which are for the NCBI databank): 1, Dechloromonas sp. strain MissR (AF170357); 2, Dechloromonas aromatica (CP000089); 3, Dechloromonas sp. strain JJ (AY032611); 4, Dechloromonas agitata (AF047462); 5, Azospira (Dechlorosoma) suillum (AF170348); 6, Azoarcus evansii (X77679); 7, Azoarcus sp. strain HA (AF482683); 8, strain C7b; 9, strain C7a; 10, strain B7; 11, strain B2; 12, strain Bcol1; 13, strain A4; 14, strain A5; 15, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (NC_004347); 16, Shewanella algae isolate 62 (DQ883817); 17, Escherichia coli K-12 (NC_010473); 18, Pseudomonas sp. strain NMX (AF482685); 19, strain A7, 20, Pseudomonas sp. strain BU (AF482684); 21, Marinobacter sp. strain SBS (AF482686); 22, Paracoccus denitrificans (Y16927); 23, Agrobacterium sp. strain PB (AF482682); 24, strain D5; 25, strain D1; 26, strain A1; 27, Dechlorospirillum sp. strain VDY (EF405824); 28, Dechlorospirillum sp. strain WD (AF170352); 29, Geothrix fermentans (EF405824); 30, Geobacter metallirreducens (AF170352); and 31, Myxobacterium sp. strain KC (AF482687). The isolate sequences are color coded based on the reported humic substance response. A phylogenetic response is defined when \u03fe85% of the OTUs in a group respond uniformly to HA treatment. Taxon level responses are denoted with shading with colors similar to those used for the OTU designations."
