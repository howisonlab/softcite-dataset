            "text": "This study demonstrates the prevalence, phylogenetic diversity, and physiology of nitrate-reducing microorganisms capable of utilizing reduced humic acids (HA) as electron donors in agricultural soils. Most probable number (MPN) enumeration of agricultural soils revealed large populations (10 4 to 10 6 cells g \u060a1 soil) of microorganisms capable of reducing nitrate while oxidizing the reduced HA analog 2,6-anthrahydroquinone disulfonate (AH 2 DS) to its corresponding quinone. Nitratedependent HA-oxidizing organisms isolated from agricultural soils were phylogenetically diverse and included members of the Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. Advective up-flow columns inoculated with corn plot soil and amended with reduced HA and nitrate supported both HA oxidation and enhanced nitrate reduction relative to no-donor or oxidized HA controls. The additional electron donating capacity of reduced HA could reasonably be attributed to the oxidation of reduced functional groups. Subsequent 16S rRNA gene-based high-density oligonucleotide microarray (PhyloChip) indicated that reduced HA columns supported the development of a bacterial community enriched with members of the Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, and Betaproteobacteria relative to the no-donor control and initial inoculum. This study identifies a previously unrecognized role for HA in stimulating denitrification processes in saturated soil systems. Furthermore, this study indicates that reduced humic acids impact soil geochemistry and the indigenous bacterial community composition. IMPORTANCE This study identifies a new metabolic capacity in soil microbial communities that may be responsible for the mediation of significant nitrogen losses from soil systems. Nitrate-dependent humic acid (HA)-oxidizing organisms isolated from agricultural soils were phylogenetically diverse and included members of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. Advective up-flow columns inoculated with corn plot soil and amended with reduced HA and nitrate supported both HA oxidation and enhanced nitrate reduction relative to no-donor or oxidized HA controls. The additional electron donating capacity of reduced HA could reasonably be attributed to the oxidation of reduced functional groups.",

However, reduced redox-active functional groups within HA can be readily oxidized as electron donors for bacterial respiration (20,21). The hydroquinone content of reduced HA are considered important humus-borne electron donors of this type, and microbial oxidation of hydroquinones to corresponding quinones has been demonstrated to support nitrate, perchlorate, arsenate, and selenate reduction (20,21,(27)(28)(29). Microbial hydroquinone oxidation has been most clearly demonstrated with the model compound 2,6anthrahydroquinone disulfonate (AH 2 DS), which can be oxidized to its quinone form 2,6-anthraquinone disulfonate (AQDS). To date, all tested AH 2 DS-oxidizing bacteria have alternatively utilized reduced HA, suggesting that AH 2 DS is a good model for investigating HA-oxidizing microbiology (21).",

Our culture-dependent studies revealed the existence of a large and diverse population of NHOx and provided several novel isolates. NHOx populations coupled the oxidation of reduced HA to substantial nitrate reduction in advective flow columns. A 16S rRNA gene-based high-density oligonucleotide microarray (Phy-loChip) (30) illustrated a phylogenetic response, with specific taxa enriched exlusively in HA-amended soils relative to control and background treatments. Together, the results presented in this article demonstrate that NHOx are prevalent in agricultural soils and may play an important role in nitrate respiration.",

During the initial 7-day equilibration period, limited nitrate reduction occurred in all columns in the absence of electron donor amendment, suggesting the presence of an electron donor intrinsic to the soil. After equilibration, the columns were continuously injected at port A with electron acceptor medium containing approximately 0.5 mM nitrate.

Relative to the no-donor control, the column treated with oxidized HA supported a greater extent of nitrate reduction ( Fig. 2; see Fig. S3b in the supplemental material). By the end of the experimental period, the average nitrate concentration across the oxidized HA column was 115 M, suggesting a 54% reduction of the introduced nitrate based upon the observed 1:1 mixing ratio of the media. Similarly to the donor-free column, there was a minimal nitrate gradient along the length of the column by the end of the operation (124, 105, 110, and 122 M for ports 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively), suggesting that the majority of the microbial nitrate reduction was limited to the area between the injection ports and sampling port 1. Nitrite production (0 M to 21.9 M) was limited and transient. Fe(III) backtitration revealed that the oxidized HA medium contained a moderate amount of reduced functionalities amounting to 448.7 \u03ee 37.8 reducing microequivalents (Eq). Reducing equivalents were also detected in samples collected from the oxidized HA columns at ports 1 and 4 ( Fig. 3a). Over time, the column community was capable of more rapidly oxidizing introduced HA microequivalents ( Fig. 3a). By the end of the experimental time period, essentially all reduced microequivalents were oxidized immediately at port 1, suggesting development of a HA-oxidizing community colocalized with the most active zone of apparent nitrate reduction near the point of donor medium injection. Assuming a five-electron transfer to dinitrogen gas and accounting for 1:1 mixing of the media, oxidation of these reduced functionalities in donor medium (224 Eq) accounted for approximately 33% of the total observed nitrate reduction observed in acceptor medium (135 M; 675 Eq) within the oxidized HA column. The remaining nitrate reduction may be accounted for by the intrinsic electron donating capacity of inoculum soil, degradation of introduced HA, or degradation of labile organics associated with HA.",

Assuming complete reduction of nitrate to N 2 (5-electron transfer), the extent of HA oxidation accounts for approximately 40% of the total nitrate reduction observed in the reduced HA column, suggesting that HA oxidation was a significant nitrate reduction driver in the experimental system. (v) Electron balance. As illustrated in the no-donor control column and calculated for HA-treated columns, donor species intrinsic to soil as well as potential degradation of HA or HAassociated organics, supported nitrate reduction in each column system. Nevertheless, the presence of reduced HA functionalities increased the nitrate reduction capacity of column systems, accounting for up to 40% of total observed respiratory activity. The difference in nitrate reduction between oxidized and reduced column treatments (211 M to 135 M) is approximately 76 M, corresponding to 380 Eq of additional electron transfer, assuming production of dinitrogen gas. The additional reduced functionalities in the reduced HA treatment relative to the oxidized treatment (approximately 303 Eq accounting for dilution) therefore accounts for approximately 80% of the additional nitrate reduction observed. This correlation implies that the additional electron donating capacity of the reduced HA treatment can be attributed to the enhanced content of reduced functional groups.",

The populations of NHOx observed in this study varied between 10 4 cells g \u03ea1 soil (native grassland soil) and 10 6 cells g \u03ea1 soil (forest and corn plot soil). Notably, MPN-based studies of heterotrophic nitrate-reducing bacteria in agricultural soils routinely reveal populations between 10 4 and 10 6 cells g \u03ea1 soil, in the same log range as the MPN analysis performed here (32,33). Although total heterotrophic nitratereducing bacterial populations were not enumerated in this study, it is plausible that a significant portion of culturable nitraterespiring organisms present in agricultural soils are capable of HA oxidation. Many of the isolates in this study were members of the Alcaligenes or Pseudomonas genera, which have routinely been isolated as denitrifying organisms from agricultural and rhizosphere soils (1,32,34).

The presence of reduced functional groups increased the electron donating capacity of HA, and the reduced functional group content roughly correlated with the difference in oxidation state between similar HA treatments. However, addition of either HA always supported a greater extent of nitrate reduction than would be expected based solely upon oxidation of the reduced functional group content alone. This discrepancy persists when electron donors intrinsic to the soil were accounted for in no-donor control systems. One potential explanation for this observation is microbial degradation of HA or HA-associated organics. Enhanced denitrification in response to humic amendments has been illustrated for soils and wetland or riverbed sediments (7,14,35,36). These studies did not generally discriminate between degradative oxidation of humic materials and nondegradative oxidation of reduced functional groups. Although HA were potentially slowly degraded in column systems studied here, oxidation of reduced functional groups still accounted for a significant percentage of the nitrate respired in both oxidized and reduced HA columns (up to 40%).",

A survey exploring the relative abundance of bacterial phyla within 71 soils from a range of ecosystems revealed a strong and ubiquitous inverse relationship between carbon availability and Acidobacteria abundance (37). Consequently, it is important to note that the enrichment of 16S rRNA gene sequences in this column study may not be a direct result of HA oxidation and reduction but an artifact of the microbial habitat created by the addition of HA (37). However, it is well documented that isolated members of the Acidobacteria are capable of both oxidation and reduction of quinone moieties (20), which suggests a physiological role in HA redox reactions for the Acidobacteria in these HAamended columns. Unlike the Acidobacteria, Firmicutes sequences were identified only in reduced HA-treated columns. This selective enrichment of Firmicutes only in reduced HA columns suggests a functional role for these species in oxidation of reduced HA functional groups.",

The columns were filled with a matrix containing 1 N HCl-washed, autoclaved 3-mm-diameter glass beads (Walter Stern no. 100C) inoculated 10% (wt/ wt) by manual mixing with corn plot soil (~750 ml total matrix volume/ column). The columns were sparged with He, sealed with rubber stoppers, and covered with aluminum foil. The columns were incubated for 2 days with approximately 370 ml of medium containing 500 M nitrate to allow for microbial adherence and then equilibrated for flow rate and nitrate breakthrough over 7 days by continually injecting port A with electron acceptor medium (1.0 mM nitrate) and port B with donor-free medium (average total flow rate of 3.1 \u03ee 0.2 ml/h). After 7 days, the nitrate concentrations in continually injected acceptor medium were reduced to 0.5 mM, and donor treatments commenced through continual injection of donor medium at port B. Donor treatments were as follows: donor-free medium, 0.5 g/liter oxidized Aldrich HA medium, and 0.5 g/ liter reduced Aldrich HA medium. Column performance was assessed by frequent retention time and total medium flowthrough measurements. Nitrate, nitrite, bromide, and reduced HA content were analyzed at time points along the length of each column at ports 1, 2, 3, and 4. Reduced HA content was defined as the difference between Fe(II) generated in backtitration reactions and Fe(II) present in the native initial sample prior to Fe(III) citrate addition and was calculated as follows: reduced HA \u03ed Fe(II) back-titration -Fe(II) initial .",

To characterize changes in the bacterial community after humic acid treatment, DNA was extracted from the initial inoculum and from port 1 of each of three columns (no donor, oxidized HA, and reduced HA). Due to the high humic content of the soil, the previously described extraction protocol (31) was modified to increase DNA quality and yields. Specifically, 50 l of 0.1 M aluminum ammonium sulfate was added as flocculent to the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extraction buffer to minimize coextraction of humic acid material, and nucleic acids were precipitated for two hours at room temperature with polyethylene glycol (PEG) rather than isopropanol (31). Extractions three times for each soil sample with pellets from each sample combined and resuspended in 100 l of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. Coextraction of humic material in samples from the HA-treated columns resulted in brown resuspended DNA that failed to amplify by PCR. To remove humic substance contamination from the DNA, all the resuspended DNA samples were purified using the MoBio Power Soil DNA kit according to the manufacturer's protocol apart from the fact that the samples were gently mixed rather than beadbeated or vortexed. DNA quality and quantification were assessed by gel visualization. PCR amplification was conducted as previously described (Wrighton et al. [31]); the amplifications over a gradient using 8 different annealing temperatures and nondegenerate primers and were restricted to 25 cycles to minimize PCR bias. The amount of PCR product loaded onto the chips, target fragmentation, biotin labeling, PhyloChip hybridization, scanning, and staining, as well as background subtraction, noise calculation, and detection and quantification criteria were based on the protocol given in reference 30.",
