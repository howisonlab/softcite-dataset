            "text": "Introduction: Currently, there is no single consensual definition of sarcopenia in the literature. This creates a challenge for the evaluation of its prevalence and its direct or indirect impact on the quality of life of elderly populations of different races and ethnicities. Furthermore, no studies as yet have analyzed these variables in populations of elderly subjects of the \"quilombola\" ethnic group. Objective: We aimed to verify the association between sarcopenia and quality of life in quilombola elderly using the Baumgartner and the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criteria. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 70 male and female participants (mean age: 65.58\u00b16.67 years). Quality of life was evaluated using the multidimensional 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) of the Medical Outcomes Study. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the Baumgartner cutoff for appendicular skeletal muscle mass and the criteria recommended by the EWGSOP. Muscle mass and fat mass percentages were analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, while handgrip strength (HGS) was evaluated using a hand-held dynamometer. Physical performance was assessed through a gait speed test. Results: The prevalence of sarcopenia was 15% according to the Baumgartner cutoff and 10% according to EWGSOP criteria. Quilombola elderly classified as physically active or very active were at least six times less likely to develop sarcopenia than those classified as irregularly active or sedentary. HGS was negatively associated with a diagnosis of sarcopenia according to both sets of criteria. Subjects with sarcopenia reported lower scores than those without the condition on the physical role functioning and bodily pain domains of the SF-36. Conclusion: In this sample of quilombola elderly, quality of life was negatively associated with sarcopenia, regardless of the classification criteria used. Additionally, the results showed that diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia should include reductions in lean mass in addition to measures of functioning and physical performance because some subjects showed the former symptom without any alteration of the latter two variables. The cutoff value suggested by Baumgartner criteria were less accurate than that specified by the EWGSOP criteria because they do not consider functioning and physical performance. However, Baumgartner criteria were more sensitive in detecting sarcopenia because reductions in lean mass predict alterations in strength and walking speed.",

[6][7][8] These conditions may cause functional dependence and increase the likelihood of hospitalization and institutionalization, as well as causing significant health care costs and taking a heavy toll on quality of life. 9 According to the literature, there is significant difficulty in estimating the prevalence of sarcopenia 10 due to the various techniques used to assess muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance, as well as the different diagnostic cutoffs and the variability in the anthropometric and socioeconomic diversity of the populations studied. Therefore, to improve the management of this condition, diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia in different elderly populations should also consider variables such as race and ethnicity.",

As per the global trend, the elderly population of quilombola communities has also increased. 14 Although the health of minority populations is a widely recognized priority, few studies have focused on elderly quilombola populations. Investigations of the relationship between health and quality of life in these subjects are especially scarce, and the few existing studies on the topic usually involve stratified samples. 15 Although the literature suggests that sarcopenia may have a negative impact on health and HRQOL, little is known regarding the repercussions of this condition on elderly Blacks, especially those who live in quilombola communities. 10 As such, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between sarcopenia and quality of life in elderly individuals from quilombola communities using the Baumgartner and European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criteria.",

The sample also showed an elevated prevalence of sarcopenia, although this value was higher when estimated using Baumgartner (15%) than EWGSOP (10%) criteria. The findings described herein corroborate those of previous studies 11,26 on the prevalence of sarcopenia in elderly Black populations. However, no studies of this nature had ever been performed in a quilombola community in Brazil. The discrepancies between various diagnostic methods for sarcopenia have been investigated by several studies. 27,28 In this investigation, the cutoff value suggested by Baumgartner was less accurate than that specified by the EWGSOP because it does not consider functioning and physical performance, both of which have been found to predict fragility, mortality, mobility incidents, disability, and the risk of institutionalization and hospitalization in elderly populations. 10 However, the Baumgartner criteria were more sensitive in detecting sarcopenia because reductions in lean mass predict alterations in strength and walking speed. 11 Therefore, additional studies comparing the use of different criteria and cutoff points in this population are required, as is the adaptation of the said criteria and cutoffs to other racial/ ethnic groups. 27,28 There is an urgent need for a consensus on the best method to diagnose sarcopenia in racial and ethnic groups such as the quilombola population.  The increased likelihood of loss of lean mass in males according to the criteria specified by Baumgartner et al 19 may be partly attributed to the reduction in testosterone and growth hormone levels observed with advancing age. 29,30 Interestingly, when sarcopenia was diagnosed based on functional capacity in addition to lean mass loss, no significant sex differences in its prevalence were observed. These findings suggest that, although elderly subjects with sarcopenia do show reductions in lean mass, their HGS may be preserved, regardless of their sex.",

This result corroborates the findings of several previous studies 9,33,34 on the association between sarcopenia and lifestyle factors in elderly populations, which found that subjects who report little to no physical activity are at higher risk of developing both sarcopenia and disability than those with high activity levels. As such, interventions which aim to promote or maintain high levels of physical activity, such as resistance training, may be a useful tool for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. 35 These interventions have been found to have a beneficial effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function. 7 Although there is some disagreement in the literature as to the ideal exercise program for subjects with sarcopenia, resistance training has yielded positive results in these populations due to its effects on skeletal muscle hypertrophy. 36 All subjects who met both diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia were either normal (EWGSOP: n=5; and Baumgartner: n=6) or underweight (EWGSOP: n=2; and Baumgartner: n=5). This result corroborates the results of previous studies, which reported a negative association between BMI and sarcopenia, whereby subjects with low BMI were more likely to develop the disorder, even in rural elderly populations. 37 In the Brazilian population, Da Silva et al 38 obtained a similar finding in both men and women and found that social conditions such as low income, low educational levels, loneliness, and lifestyle factors may also be associated with sarcopenia.",

Both domains are part of the physical component of HRQOL. These findings suggest that sarcopenia may have a greater effect on physical health than on mental health. According to the literature, low muscle strength and low muscle mass may both be associated with poor quality of life. 42,43 In a study performed by Sayer et al, 44 the relationship between HGS and HRQOL was evaluated in 2,987 men and women aged between 59 years and 73 years. HRQOL was evaluated using the SF-36, while a hand-held dynamometer was used to measure HGS. The study found that low HGS was associated with lower scores on the physical functioning, physical role functioning, general health perceptions, vitality, and bodily pain scales of the SF-36 and was therefore related to both sarcopenia and generalized frailty. A comparative study of HRQOL in subjects with \"sarco-osteopenia\" and healthy adults found that the former obtained lower scores on the physical functioning, vitality, physical role functioning, and emotional role functioning domains than the latter, which is consistent with the impact of sarcopenia on HRQOL. 45 Sarcopenia had a negative impact on the quality of life of quilombola subjects, as shown by the correlational analysis performed in this study. As such, future studies may wish to develop a measure of HRQOL specific to sarcopenia.",
