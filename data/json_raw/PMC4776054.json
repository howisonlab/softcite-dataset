Due to the unintended potential misclassifications of the World Health Organization (WHO) immunological failure criteria in predicting virological failure, limited availability of treatment options, poor laboratory infrastructure, and healthcare providers' confidence in making switches, physicians delay switching patients to second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). Evaluating whether timely switching and delayed switching are associated with the risk of opportunistic infections (OI) among patients with unrecognized treatment failure is critical to improve patient outcomes. Methods. A retrospective review of 637 adolescents and adults meeting WHO immunological failure criteria was conducted. Timely and delayed switching to second-line ART were defined when switching happened at <3 and \u22653 months, respectively, after failure diagnosis was made. Cox proportional hazard marginal structural models were used to assess the effect of switching to second-line ART on the risk of developing OI. Results. Of 637 patients meeting WHO immunological failure criteria, 396 (62.2%) switched to second-line ART. Of those switched, 230 (58.1%) were delayed. Switching to second-line ART reduced the risk of OI (adjusted hazards ratio [AHR], 0.4; 95% CI, .2-.6). Compared with patients who received timely switch after failure diagnosis was made, those who delayed switching were more likely to develop OI (AHR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.3). Conclusions. Delayed switching to second-line ART after failure diagnosis may increase the risk of OI. Serial immunological assessment for switching patients to second-line ART is critical to improve their outcomes."

Because of the lack of routine viral load monitoring, the definition of treatment failure to a large extent depends entirely on World Health Organization (WHO) clinical and immunological failure criteria [3][4][5]. Due to the potential misclassification of treatment failure resulting from using these failure criteria [6][7][8][9] as well as limited availability of treatment options, poor laboratory infrastructure, low healthcare provider confidence in making switches, and high costs of second-line ART, physicians are often reluctant [3,4,10,11] to switch. One consequence of unrecognized treatment failures and/or delayed switches may be an increased risk of opportunistic infections (OI).",

A higher proportion of patients remain on a failed first-line regimen in programs without routine viral load monitoring, compared with those in programs with routine viral load monitoring [8]. Of patients meeting WHO immunological and clinical failure criteria, <45% are switched to second-line ART [12,13]. The rate of switch is higher in eastern Europe than in sub-Saharan Africa [14], and the difference in the rates of switch is attributed to the lack of routine viral load monitoring in African programs. A delay in switching is also indicated by the variation in switching times from diagnosis of failure [2,14]. In addition, in resource-limited settings, switching happens earlier in programs with routine viral load monitoring than in those without [15].",

Records of patients attending the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), Mawenzi Regional Hospital (MRH), and Kibosho, Kilema, and Machame Hospitals between January 2004 and August 2013 were reviewed. Patients who were <13 years old were excluded. According to the hierarchy of the health system in Tanzania, KCMC is a tertiary referral hospital, MRH is a regional hospital, and Kibosho, Kilema, and Machame are district hospitals. These care and treatment centers (CTCs) offer treatment according to the Tanzanian Ministry of Health treatment guidelines for the provision of ART. According to these guidelines, patients receive a fixed-dose combination of stavudine (D4T), lamivudine (3TC), and nevirapine (NVP) as first-line ART. Zidovudine (AZT) and efavirenz re used in place of D4T and NVP, respectively, depending upon toxicities and concurrent medications. Each patient is typically seen on a monthly basis and their prescriptions are refilled. At the time of this study, routine viral load monitoring was not available in these CTCs; therefore, patients were switched to second-line ART based on clinical and immunological criteria according to the WHO guidelines (www.who.int/ hiv/pub/arv/adult2010) of a decline in CD4 + cell count to the pretreatment value or below \u226550% decline from the peak value CD4 + cell count value while on treatment or persistent low CD4 + cell count <100 c/mm 3 . The drugs used for second-line ART included tenofovir, abacavir (ABC), and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r); atazanavir/ritonavir was substituted for LPV/r as needed. The second-line nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor choice for adolescents and adults depended on the first-line ART. For patients on AZT or D4T in first-line ART, the default second-line option was tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) combined with 3TC or FTC and LPV/r. For those who had received TDF in first-line, the second-line option was an AZTbased regimen. For those who were on TDF during first-line because of intolerance to AZT or D4T, an alternative secondline option was ABC combined with 3TC or FTC and LPV/r."

Time-varying covariate (CD4 cell) affects both time-varying exposure (time to switching) and outcome (OI or death). In addition, switching history predicts future CD4 cell count. Because of the existence of such scenarios, the use of marginal structural models (MSMs) is recommended. We assessed the effect of switching to second-line ART on the risk of OI using Cox proportional hazards MSMs, which address confounding by indication. CD4 + cell count was considered as a time-varying confounder. To ensure switching to second-line ART happened after a time-varying confounder, CD4 + cell count values at failure diagnosis were assigned to the preceding month. Other covariates included age, gender, adherence to first-line ART, adherence to second-line ART, treatment sites, and duration spent on first-line ART. Patients began accumulating person time from the moment failure diagnosis was made, and they were observed until first occurrence of an opportunistic infection, death, lost to follow-up, or end of the study, whichever came first. All patients who died, were loss to follow-up, and did not experience OI were censored in the primary analysis."

After computation of the stabilized weights, we used Cox proportional hazards MSMs to estimate the associations.

We used log-rank tests to compare the hazard functions for those switched against those not switched to second-line ART. Poisson regression models were used to compute the incidence rate of OI. Two sensitivity analyses were performed: the first defined time from failure diagnosis to death or first occurrence of OI used as the outcome, and the second used propensity scores weighting to assess the effect of switching to second-line ART on the risk of OI. In the second case, the main exposure switching to second-line ART was considered as time fixed mimicking the design of a randomized controlled trial where every eligible patient would be assigned either to be switched or not at baseline. A regression model to generate the scores included the following variables: age (<30, 30-55, >55), gender, months patient spent on first-line ART (<36, 36-60, >60), CD4 cell count (<100, 100-200, >200), sites (tertiary hospital, regional hospital, district hospital), percentage adherence to first-line ART (<90, \u226590), and percentage adherence to second-line ART (<90, \u226590)."

            "text": "The study attempted to assess the association between switching to second-line ART and the risk of OI among HIV-infected patients meeting immunologic failure criteria from 5 CTCs in northern Tanzania. We demonstrated that switching to second-line ART reduced the incidence of OI among patients meeting immunological failure criteria infections (AHR, 0.4; Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier curves for 637 human immunodeficiency virus-infected adolescent and adult patients according to switching status. 95% CI, .2-.6). Furthermore, time of switching impacted the risk of OI with longer delays associated with approximately 2fold increase in risk relative to timely switching. In the absence of routine viral load testing for determining treatment failure, delayed switching is common in many lowand middle-income countries [2,14,19]. In this study, only 62% of those meeting immunological failure criteria switched at all, and the median time to switch from the time of immunological failure diagnosis was 5.1 months. Limited availability of the second-line medications, low sensitivity of the WHO immunologic failure criteria in predicting virological failure, and low confidence of healthcare providers in making switches may have contributed to the delays in switching. In addition to these factors, delays in switching in this cohort could as also be explained by the low levels of adherence. Approximately 75% of the patients had adherence levels below 90% before switch. Those with low levels of adherence may have been less likely to be switched. Similar delays in switching were documented in Haiti where the median time to switching to second-line ART was 7 months and patients with adherence below 90% were less likely to be switched [13]. Substantial proportions of patients who met immunological failure criteria in a study from Mali [3] did not switch to second-line ART, and the median duration of follow up from failure diagnosis was 5 months. These observations suggest that delays in switching to second-line ART are a serious management concern across low-and middle-income countries.",

We observed a slightly lower incidence rate of 2.1 episodes per 100 person years. The high incidence of OI is likely attributable to unrecognized treatment failure and relatively severe immunosuppression. Among those who switched, approximately half of the patients in our study had CD4 + cell count <100 c/mm 3 at the time of switch.

However, because physicians did not have the knowledge of the HIV-RNA results, it is unlikely that their decisions were directly influenced by the HIV RNA. High plasma HIV-RNA leads to suppression of the patient's immunity, which is being reflected by the low CD4 cell count that was controlled for in this study."

Furthermore, the risk of opportunistic infection is higher when the delay to switch is 3 months or longer from the time of failure. Delay in switching could mainly be due to uncertainties physicians have due to the relatively poor ability of the WHO immunological failure criteria to predict virological failure. If this theory is true, efforts should be made to invest in viral load testing equipment to improve the timing of failure diagnosis and manage patients accordingly. This process could be made possible by placing a central testing laboratory where patients' dry blood spots from different care and treatment centers could be evaluated. Dry blood spot is known to reduce logistic difficulties and the cost that is associated with the use of plasma."
