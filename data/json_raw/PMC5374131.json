            "text": "Due to advances in endoscopy and its widespread use, detection of submucosal tumors (SMTs) of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is not uncommon. In the evaluation of SMTs of the GI tract, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a useful tool for identifying the tumor's layer of origin, measuring its size, providing the details of tumor echotexture, and differentiating it from external compression [1] . Among SMTs in the stomach, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common [2] . When EUS reveals a hypoechoic submucosal tumor originating from the muscularis propria (SMTMP) in the stomach, GIST is considered first followed by leiomyoma [3][4][5][6][7][8][9] . Because all GISTs have a malignant potential and leiomyomas have a benign nature, tissue acquisition is often recommended for such tumors. At present, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a feasible method. However, the diagnostic rate may be limited when the tumor is smaller or the tumor location is difficult to approach [10][11][12] .",

Obviously, tissue obtained by EUS-FNA can demonstrate GISTs only but cannot provide further information regarding mitotic activity. EUS features suggestive of a malignant GIST include larger tumor size, heterogeneous hypoechotexure, irregular tumor border, and internal cystic or calcified changes [8,14,15] . At present, a GIST > 3 cm is considered to have higher malignant potential and is recommended for surgical resection [16] . As for GISTs < 1 cm, they are frequently considered to harbor a low risk of malignancy and tissue acquisition in these cases is controversial [17] . Notably, GISTs in the stomach are often indolent and rapid progression is uncommon. It should be considered whether all the myogenic submucosal tumors in the stomach are necessary for pathologic demonstration to differentiate GISTs from leiomyomas, especially in 1-3 cm tumors. Until now, associated discussions regarding the natural course and management of 1-3 cm gastric SMTMPs are limited. Here, we reviewed computerized medical records over a period of 14 years from our institution to study the natural behaviors of such tumors.",

Two patients eventually underwent surgery due to gradually enlarged tumors and were confirmed to have GISTs with a low malignant potential. Two patients refused EUS surveillance due to old age (> 80 years). Seven patients who took regular follow-ups remained condition stable without tumor metastasis. One patient was lost to follow-up. The flow chart of these 12 patients in the progressive subgroup is shown in Figure 4.",

            "text": "GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumors in the GI tract. Pathologically, most GISTs are composed of spindle cells and epithelioid cells which are derived from interstitial cells of Cajal [19][20][21] . Most GISTs (approximately 65%) occur in the stomach, followed by 30%-35% in the small intestine and 5%-10% in the colon. About 95% of GISTs are characterized by the positive expression of c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (CD117), whereas approximately 60%-70% of the tumors are positive for CD34 [22][23][24] . Most gastric GISTs are asymptomatic and are detected incidentally as submucosal tumors during endoscopy. Therefore, the real incidence of GISTs in the stomach remains unclear. EUS is the most common modality for the evaluation of submucosal tumors. A suspected GIST is a hypoechoic and myogenic tumor originating mostly from the muscularis propria and occasionally from the muscularis mucosae. Similar to GISTs in terms of the stationary subgroup were confirmed to have leiomyomas. Basic characteristics and EUS findings for patients with confirmed GISTs and leiomyomas are shown in Tables 2-4. CD117 was positive in all 13 patients with confirmed GISTs (100%), whereas CD34 was positive in 11 (84.6%). Pathology results for confirmed cases suggested 4 GISTs with a very low malignant potential, 6 with a low potential, 2 with an intermediate potential, and 1 with a high potential. No  EUS findings, leiomyomas are also tumors of muscular origin. Unlike GISTs, leiomyomas are negative for CD117 and CD34, but positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and desmin on immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, leiomyomas are completely benign. Recent studies have demonstrated that all GISTs have a malignant potential. Therefore, suspected GISTs should be confirmed histologically and managed accordingly. However, GISTs often behave differently at different locations. A GIST in the stomach is often more indolent than a GIST with a similar size and mitotic count located in another GI tract site [25] .",

Most GISTs < 1 cm harbor a very low malignant potential, while GISTs \u2265 3 cm with irregular tumor borders, heterogeneous hypoechogenicity, and internal   Therefore, tumor progression may be a good predictor for differentiating GISTs from leiomyomas. Moreover, we found that larger tumors with irregular margins showed a tendency toward progressive change and should be monitored more closely. From the ROC curve analysis, we found 1.4 cm to be the optimal cut-off tumor size associated with tumor progression. The same 1.4 cm cut-off size was reported by Fang et al [27] in their study, which is similar to that reported by Lachter et al [28] who found tumor size larger than 1.7cm to be indicative of tumor progression. Tumors with heterogeneous hypoechotexture showed no statistical significance for predicting tumor progression (P = 0.06) in our study, but the finding is limited by our small number of cases and requires clarification in a larger study. Regarding the appropriate interval of EUS surveillance, it is difficult to conclude how often a suspected gastric GIST should be followed since malignant GISTs were not detected during surveillance in our study. Although an evidences-based optimal EUS surveillance policy remains lacking for small GISTs, yearly EUS follow-up for small sized GISTs (< 3 cm) should be considered from a study of Prachayakul et al [26] in 2012. At present, a guideline from European society of medical oncology recommended that an interval of 3 mo in the first follow-up and then annual EUS surveillance may be optimal for small suspected GISTs if no tumor growth occurs during surveillance [29] . In this review of 1725 EUS surveillances for gastric submucosal tumors from the 14 years of medical records, we found that most 1-3 cm SMTMPs in the stomach were indolent with only 28.4% of patients experiencing tumor progression (tumor enlargement \u2265 1.2 times). EUS surveillance is optimal for small gastric myogenic submucosal tumors without immediately obtaining tissue. Tumor progression is a good predictor for differentiating GISTs from leiomyomas. Risk factors for tumor progression include larger tumor and irregular borders. Initial tumor size > 14.0 mm may be considered a cut-off size for predicting tumor progression.",
