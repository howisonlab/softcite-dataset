            "text": "Background: Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) are predisposed to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Studies have indicated a strong genetic background. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a breeding scheme involving auscultation and echocardiography. Animals: In the Danish Kennel Club mandatory breeding scheme, 997 purebred CKCS were examined during the period 2002-2011. Each dog was evaluated 1-4 times with a total of 1,380 examinations. Methods: Auscultation and echocardiography were performed to evaluate mitral regurgitation murmur severity and degree of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The odds of having mitral regurgitation murmur or MVP > grade 1 in 2010-2011 compared to 2002-2003 were estimated using logistic regression analysis including age and sex as covariates. Odds were estimated for dogs that were products of the breeding scheme (defined as dogs with both parents approved by the breeding scheme before breeding) and non-products of the breeding scheme (defined as dogs with at least 1 parent with unknown cardiac status). Results: In 2010-2011, the odds of having mitral regurgitation murmur were 0.27 if dogs were a product of the breeding scheme compared with dogs in 2002-2003, reflecting a 73% decreased risk (P < .0001). If non-products of the breeding scheme examined in 2010-2011 were compared with dogs in 2002-2003, no difference in odds was found (P = .49). Conclusion and Clinical Importance: A mandatory breeding scheme based on auscultation and echocardiography findings significantly decreased the prevalence of MMVD over the 8-to 10-year period. Such a breeding scheme therefore is recommended for CKCS.",

            "text": "M yxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) often causes cardiac-related death in dogs <10 years of age. 1 The disease results in valvular extracellular matrix changes including deposition of mucopolysaccarides and collagen degeneration. 2 The valvular changes may cause mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and insufficient closure of the mitral valve leading to mitral regurgitation. 2 Mitral regurgitation murmur intensity and echocardiographic MVP are predictors of MMVD progression in dogs. [3][4][5] The disease is most common in small and medium-sized dog breeds, but often is a relatively benign condition because of its slow disease progression. 5,6 A higher prevalence and earlier onset of the disease have been reported in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) compared to other dog breeds. 1,3,7 A study from Sweden based on animal insurance data from 1995 to 2006 shows that the disease accounts for 37% of the total mortality among CKCS <10 years of age. 1 Hereditary background of MMVD has long been suggested on the basis of a higher prevalence of the disease in certain dog breeds, 2 and more recent studies indicate strong genetic background with polygenic inheritance. 8,9 In CKCS, a positive association between parental heart status and mitral regurgitation murmur intensity in 5 year-old offspring has been reported. 8 Furthermore, in Dachshunds, a positive association has been found between the degree of MVP in parents and offspring. 9 Based on data from the United Kingdom, a high heritability for MMVD in CKCS has been estimated. 10 The heritability for having a mitral regurgitation murmur and for the grade of murmur intensity was estimated to 0.33 and 0.67, respectively. 10 Furthermore, a recent genome-wide association study found 2 gene loci on chromosomes 13 and 14 that differ between CKCS with early and late onset of MMVD. 11 However, another similar genome-wide association study including a lower number of CKCS did not find any association between gene loci and MMVD disease severity. 12 Additional studies are needed to further elucidate associations between gene changes and MMVD disease severity.",

To continue breeding in DKCS after 4 years of age dogs had to be reexamined. From January 2007, an additional restriction was decided introducing an additional reexamination after 6 years of age for male dogs. At all examination time points, dogs were excluded from breeding if they had MVP grade 3 (first a criterion from 2007) or a mitral regurgitation murmur grade \u22653. Dogs with grade 2 murmurs were excluded if they had MVP grades 2 or 3. Thus, cardiac health criteria for breeding in the MMVD breeding scheme of the DKCA were as follows: Mitral regurgitation murmur of 1 at a maximum combined with a MVP grade 2 at a maximum; or a grade 2 murmur combined with a degree of MVP not >1. Before 2007, dogs with a grade 3 MVP were approved if they had a murmur grade not >1. Ejection murmurs (physiological flow murmurs) were accepted. They were diagnosed as systolic murmurs with crescendo-decresendo sound configuration, point of maximal intensity at the left heart base and with minimal or no concurrent mitral regurgitation estimated using color flow Doppler echocardiography. 17 These dogs often have aortic flow maximum velocity on the higher side of the normal reference range (>1.5 m/s). 18 This observation was used to confirm the diagnosis. Dogs with heart murmurs caused by non-MMVD cardiac disease were excluded. Mitral regurgitation murmur intensity and MVP status of all examined dogs became freely available from DKCA homepage after examination. Each parent needed to fulfill the cardiac health criteria for registration of their puppies in DKCA.",

Some schemes include annual cardiac examinations where as others have a more limited number of cardiac examinations during the dog's lifetime. In some schemes, the cardiac examination results are open to the public, in others the results are only known by the dog owner.

In a subanalysis of the voluntary British breeding scheme, it became evident that only 4% of the dog owners had followed the breeding advice. 21 Number of included observers and observer experience also may influence the effect of breeding schemes because observer variations are wellknown with regard to cardiac auscultation and echocardiography. 14,17 Therefore interobserver variation was taken into account in the statistical analyses in this study. Unexpected reduction over time in individual mitral regurgitation murmur intensity or degree of MVP was observed in only a few dogs with repeated examinations. The reductions may be the result of changed physiological conditions in the dog such as changed body condition, heart rate, or both. 9,17 Color flow Doppler echocardiography can confirm the diagnosis of mitral regurgitation, but experienced observers can detect mitral regurgitation using auscultation in 89% of dogs with mild or more severe mitral regurgitation (regurgitant jet area >30% of the left atrial area). 17 Moderately, experienced observers (general practitioners level) can detect mitral regurgitation in 72% of the dogs by auscultation. Echocardiography is useful to support the diagnosis of ejection murmurs (physiological flow murmurs) and other heart murmurs not associated with mitral regurgitation. 17 In this study, approximately 6% of the dogs examined from 2002 to 2011 were diagnosed with ejection murmurs based on clinical findings and echocardiography. In a previous study, 6 of 57 (10%) CKCS were diagnosed with ejection murmurs based on auscultation and phonography. 17 Ejection murmurs do not seem to be associated with heart disease, 17,18 and exclusion of dogs with ejection murmurs in breeding schemes may unnecessarily decrease the number of CKCS available for breeding. Estimation of mitral regurgitant jet size in relation to left atrial area using color flow Doppler echocardiography is a semi-quantitative estimate influenced by several factors including echocardiographic equipment and technical settings. 22 This limitation may affect the use of this method in breeding schemes including multicenter clinical examinations.",

However in 2010 and 2011, PB were found to have a decreased risk of having moderate to severe MVP compared to non-PB suggesting an effect of the breeding scheme on this parameter as well.",

One of the observers in the breeding scheme was replaced in 2004 and the overall observer performance may have changed during the 8to 10-year time period. Clinical observer was included as random variable in the statistical models to take observer variation into account. However, it was not possible to include MVP observer variation in the modeling. Yet, the finding of a decreased risk of MMVD was confirmed by comparison of the risk of having a mitral regurgitation murmur and moderate to severe MVP (MVP > 1) within a limited time period (2010-2011) between PB and non-PB during a period with no observer replacements. Finally, it is a study limitation that observers were not blinded to the identity of the dogs.",
