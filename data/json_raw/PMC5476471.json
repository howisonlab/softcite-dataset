In large domestic animals the situation is drastically different and there is still a need for further researches aiming at identifying all the homologous interleukins and comparing their functions among species. We performed here a bibliometric analysis of all interleukins described in the literature in various large animal species to identify what is known so far and to underline where there is a need for new studies. Using indicators such as H index but also M quotient, A index, G index, GH ratio, and HG index we ranked 39 interleukins identified so far in bovine, caprine, equine, ovine, and porcine, the main large domestic animals. Indexes and ratio under investigations were higher for IL1, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, and IL18 than for other interleukins, particularly in bovine and porcine species and to a certain extent in equine species. Recently discovered interleukins presented low values for the different indexes, quotient, and ratio. Even some \"old\" interleukins showed low values highlighting the need for further developments in comparative immunology. For instance an interleukin such as IL4 demonstrated variation in its functions between species. In conclusion, this study provides the first bibliometric analysis dedicated to large domestic animal interleukins and underlines the need for more studies to fully determine the structure and the functions of interleukins in other mammal species.",

Besides, in large domestic animals the situation is quite different (Montoya and Meurens, 2015;Summerfield, 2009). Indeed, basic or applied immunology studies dealing with large domestic animals constitute less than 5% of the publications in major immunology journals. However, some specialized journals like Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology, Veterinary Microbiology and Developmental and Comparative Immunology are dedicated to animal immunology and infectious diseases and several studies about large domestic animal immunology were published in the last years.",

Some of them such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-6 have proinflammatory actions while some other ones such as IL-4, IL10 and IL-37 are clearly anti-inflammatory compounds making them interesting targets to diagnose or treat various conditions (Carinci et al., 2016;Conti et al., 2017;Lin et al., 2016;Mahdavi-Roshan et al., 2016;Wu et al., 2016). The word interleukin, created in 1979, derives from Latin Inter-(\"between, amid\") and \u2212leukin because many interleukins are produced by leukocytes and stimulate these cells (di Giovine and Duff, 1990). Logically the first interleukin to be identified was interleukin 1 (di Giovine and Duff, 1990). Since then many interleukins were described in various species including human, mouse and large domestic animals. However, papers related to specific interleukins in a determined species are not so frequent and there are significant variations in the knowledge of interleukins between species.",

            "text": "The measure of the scientific productivity and quality of a particular researcher has been widely used by managers, research institutions, and funding agencies to evaluate professional promotions or to rank projects and grants. Created in 2005 (Hirsch, 2005), the H index, which is the number of published papers (N) that have been cited N or more times, became quickly popular to assess researchers at different stages of their career. Originally used to assess scientists the H index was then proposed to evaluate countries (Csajb\u00f3k et al., 2007), journals (Braun et al., 2006), and even, more recently, animal and human pathogens (Cox et al., 2016;D\u00edaz et al., 2016;Ducrot et al., 2016;McIntyre et al., 2011). Regarding pathogens these studies were particularly interesting in identifying the hot and/or neglected topics. Because H index has some drawbacks most of these studies also used other bibliometric indicators such as A index, G index, HG index, GH ratio, M quotient, and Deciphering Citations Organized by Subject (Dcos) index which measure the contribution that a given author, institute or country would have in a specific research area or subject (D\u00edaz et al., 2016;Ducrot et al., 2016). A simultaneous use of the various indicators could provide a more accurate view of the situation for a specific subject. So far, no studies applied bibliometric indexes to immune mediators such as cytokines, interleukins, and chemokines. With the development of comparative immunology there is a need for complementary approaches to assess what has been done and what needs to be done.",

Indeed, IL1 family includes, amongst others, IL1\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, and IL1Ra and IL17 family IL17A to F. Because in many publications, especially the oldest ones, there was no information regarding the exact nature of the considered interleukin we did not distinguish between themselves the different members of the interleukin families and instead considered the families as a whole.

The number of articles is highly variable between interleukins ( Fig. 1) and within them between species (supplementary Table 1). Because of this high variation, no statistically significant differences were identified between the 39 interleukins. However, it can still be observed that a higher number of articles were found for interleukins 1-18 than for other interleukins. After an analysis of the found articles, we identified several articles which were not linked to the interleukin assessed in the search. These articles can be considered as false positive results and were consequently excluded for further analyses. A list of selected articles was then constituted for each interleukins and each species (supplementary Table 1). In some cases, the difference in the number of articles was quite important. For instance, in bovine IL1, from 271 articles, 223 were kept. These differences illustrate the necessity to check articles one by one.",

The differences between species are lower regarding M quotient than H index. For instance, ovine IL1 M quotient or equine IL10 M quotient are very similar to their bovine and porcine counterparts. Moreover, some interleukins such as IL22, IL23, and IL29 showed values \u22650.4 in bovine, ovine, and porcine species (supplementary Table 1). A index is the mean number of citations of the papers included in H index. Using that index, IL6, IL8, and IL12 in the different species show increased values compared to H index graph. Differences between H and A indexes within one species are important. For instance, bovine IL5 H index is low (2) compared to ovine or horse (4 and 5, respectively) but IL5 A indexes are similar between these 3 species (24 to 25.75).

These techniques allow the simultaneous study of many targets (23 genes in (Magiri et al., 2016)) in a same experiment contrary to older experimental approach like ELISA for instance. Thereby, it was not possible to indicate all the interleukins assessed in the paper title and authors preferred to relate their study as \"interleukin expression\" (Deplanche et al., 2016), \"response of immune response genes\" (Magiri et al., 2016) or \"immune response\" (Zbinden et al., 2015). It is difficult to accurately assess the impact of this bias as the missed papers are by nature hidden. However, it can be assumed that in most of the major articles reporting studies focusing on an interleukin in a particular species, there is mention of the interleukin name and the animal species in the article title. Thus, except for less studied interleukins, the percentage of missed papers is probably lower than 10 percent. Performing the search not only based on title but also on abstract and general text could have solved that problem. This approach was not selected since it would have generated drastically longer output list with massive background.",

            "text": "Another possible error is the retrieval of several papers not related to the topic in the generated list. For instance the paper entitled \"Interleukin-22: a sheep in wolf's clothing\" was dedicated to IL22 in the mouse model and did not use any sheep in any experiment (Laurence et al., 2008). Similarly, a term such as kids refer to juveniles of both sexes in goat and can bring many papers unrelated to goat in the output list. To improve the database accuracy and to minimize the impact of potential mistakes all the references in the generated lists were revised one by one by both authors and in some searches up to 48 papers were removed (see IL1 in bovine, supplementary Table 1). Because the amount of work can become quickly important the research topic has to be well determined from the beginning. After analysis of the number of selected articles, it appears clearly that many papers have been dedicated to the study of most of the first described interleukins in the different species assessed in our report. On the contrary when newly described interleukins are considered a very low number of selected papers or even an absence of papers is observed (see for instance interleukins IL19 to IL32). Since there is a growing interest for the development of more predictive models for the study of various conditions in human biology (see for instance (Aigner et al., 2010;Gerdts et al., 2015;Meurens et al., 2012;Montoya and Meurens, 2015;Perrin, 2014)) it underlines the need for more research in comparative immunology to support these alternative models. The case of IL4 in pigs well illustrates the requirement for further research about interleukins in other mammal species. Indeed, studies about porcine IL4 demonstrated a replacement of IL4 by IL13 for some specific functions related to the development of monocyte derived dendritic cells (Bautista et al., 2007) and no role as a stimulatory factor in the development of B cells for this interleukin (Murtaugh et al., 2009). We can postulate similar situations for some other interleukins in other large animal species.",

As reagents are available for these two interleukins we can postulate the existence of more publications reporting data related to it. Regarding interleukins 24 to 39, only 5 papers were published in large domestic species, in pig, bovine, and ovine, underlining the paucity of studies dedicated to new interleukins in these species. IL23 was quite an exception with a total of 10 publications available in all the selected animal species. It is most probably linked to its major role in the Th17 response (Iwakura and Ishigame, 2006) which has been a hot topic recently. Moreover, the number of selected papers for IL23 could be slightly underestimated, especially for old papers, as this heterodimeric interleukin shares p40 subunit with IL12.",

Indeed, even if the most studied interleukin is invariably IL1, there is a large variation between species regarding other interleukins. In the pig, IL6 and IL10 have also been highly studied and generated several papers and numerous citations. When we look at M quotient and A index, we can observe high values for IL10 showing the more recent interest for this interleukin particularly involved in the pathogenesis of a major viral disease of the pig caused by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (D\u00edaz et al., 2016;Ducrot et al., 2016;Lunney et al., 2016). Research on this interleukin started more than ten years later than research on porcine IL1 and IL2 but accelerated in the last years modifying quotient and indexes. In the bovine, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10 and IL12 were particularly studied after IL1 and IL2 generating high values for H index, A index, and M quotient. In sheep, there are the special cases of IL13 which generated a high number of citations (102 citations from 2005; A index = 55.5) and IL5 with 11 selected articles and a A index of 25.75, more than in the others species and the others interleukins (IL1, IL2, IL6, IL8, and IL10). The sheep model has been used to study asthma and parasite infections which are associated to a Th2 response (Bao et al., 1996;Kasaian et al., 2007;Liravi et al., 2015;Pernthaner et al., 2005).",

As for researcher or institution evaluation, simultaneous use of different indicators was needed to assess the interest of the scientific community for a specific subject. For example, even if ovine IL13 H index was low (2), the A index (55.5) and the GH ratio (3) clearly indicated the interest developed in the researcher community for this specific interleukin. Comparing these indicators enabled interesting observations in old interleukins.",
