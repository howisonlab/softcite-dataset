            "text": "Investment in human capital is risky. Both the amount of human capital produced from given effort and resources and the returns to human capital are uncertain at the time of investment. As individuals are known to differ in risk attitudes, 1 one predicts, given everything else, a relationship between risk attitudes, investment and wages: less risk averse individuals will invest more and will experience higher wage growth and more wage volatility. This indeed is exactly what Shaw (1996) attempted to test. She reports clear support for the prediction that risk averse individuals shy away from investing in (risky) human capital and hence, experience less wage growth. In spite of the obvious relevance of the topic, other empirical research on the relationship barely exists. 2 We replicate Shaw's estimates on datasets for four countries: an extension of her original American data set and data for Spain, Germany, and Italy. Hamermesh (2007), following the psychologist John Hunter, distinguishes between statistical and scientific replication. Statistical replication involves estimating an identical model on a different sample from the same underlying population. Scientific replication involves estimating a perhaps similar, but not identical model on a different sample from a different population. In Hamermesh' view, the latter \"appears much more suited in type to our methods of research and, indeed comprises most of what economists view as replication\". We believe that replication of the same model is relevant if one assumes that models and theories have wider relevance than just one population conditioned by time or place. In our view, the first step in building a solid body of empirical evidence would be to use the same model, and only adjust if evidence compels us to do so. In our perception, the philosophy underlying empirical work is twofold: test our theories and models and estimate the magnitude of key parameters. If we would not start out from a standard model but adjust the model even before empirical investigation, the whole enterprise would be erratic and ill directed.",

            "text": "We decided to replicate Shaw's work for several reasons. First, the topic is relevant and deserves more research. Second, it's a seminal paper: the first systematic investigation of the link between risk attitude and wages. 3 Third, the model derives its empirical specification from economic theory, which we consider sound methodological practice. Fourth, the model is intuitively appealing. Fifth, as Shaw's empirical results were clearly in support of the key hypothesis, it is worth checking whether this points to an empirical regularity with wider validity. Bonin et al. (2007) report that individuals sort themselves into occupations differing in wage risk on the basis of their risk attitude and find that less risk averse individuals have higher wage levels; they do not use the Shaw framework. Brown and Taylor (2005) find that in the United Kingdom, wage growth relates negatively to risk aversion; their model is inspired 1 For empirical documentation, see Hartog et al. (2002), Dohmen et al. (2011), Ding et al. (2010). 2  Belzil and Leopardi (2007) studied the impact of risk attitudes on formal education in Italy. Hartog and Diaz-Serrano (2007) find that risk aversion affects investment in education. Diaz-Serrano (2005) estimates a negative link between risk aversion and income volatility in Italy. Hryshko et al. (2008) report the same result for the US, attributing this to selection into riskier occupations rather than to human capital investment. 3 The paper is a standard reference in related work: in June 2010, it had 93 citations at Google. by Shaw (1996) but it is not a strict replication. As stated above, we prefer a tighter methodology: theory should guide us to a specification for empirical work, empirical analysis should test this specification and its validity under a variety of conditions of time and place.",

These surveys are run at the household level and although we have some information for all adults, in the SCF, the EFF and the SHIW, the amount of risky assets is only available at the household level and the self-reported risk attitude questions are only asked to the \"reference\" person in the household. 4 Therefore, the empirical analysis includes only the reference person in each household except for the German SOEP in which we include all individuals older than 16. These datasets are described in Online Appendix A. Shaw performed her test with the SCF from 1983 to 1986. This means that the individual wage growth was calculated over a three year period. This decision was most probably driven by data availability. The time interval of the SCF sample is now 1983-1989; Shaw's original dataset referring to 1983-1986 is no longer available. 5 The individual risk attitude is measured in 1989, i.e., the last year of the time period. In order to be consistent with all data sets we will for all other countries also measure wage growth using the periods before the risk measure. For the German sample, we use the period 2000 to 2004, as our risk measure is only available for 2004. Taking a four year interval allows us to stay close to both Shaw's original results (1983Shaw's original results ( -1986 and the current US sample (1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989). In the SHIW (Italy) only the 1995 wave contains questions related to risk attitudes. We use the waves corresponding to 1993 and 1995 to estimate real wage growth. We chose this particular two year interval since it provides an acceptable number of individuals with valid answers in the risk attitude question that are present in both waves (1,357 household heads). 6 Finally, we use the first wave (2002) of the EFF (Spain). In contrast with the other data sets, the EFF is not a panel and, consequently, data on individuals' wages over time is missing. Still, we can compute wage growth within the firm, as the EFF includes a question in which individuals are asked their starting salary in the present company. Since there is information on tenure, we can compute the total wage growth of individuals since they entered the firm. This means that we are only looking at the subgroup of workers that Shaw calls \"job stayers\" (see Table 3 of Shaw's paper). Except for some effects on magnitudes, this is immaterial, as her results also hold separately for job stayers. This strategy allows us to calculate the wage growth before the year in which risk attitude is measured. A difference with Shaw's sub-sample of stayers however is that while she focuses only on job stayers in a 3-year period, we consider all the surveyed workers and their corresponding tenure in the present firm. 7 As Shaw, we define wage growth over the period as hourly wage growth except for Spain, where information on the number of hours worked in a normal week when the individual entered the firm is not available and we can therefore not compute the past hourly wage, although we know the yearly wage at that time. Therefore, the results from the EFF are based on yearly wages. 8 As in Shaw's paper, for all data sets except for the German SOEP, we present the results of two alternative measures of an individual's attitudes towards risk. One is based on the financial assets owned by the household (ASSET) and another on self-reported risk attitudes. The variable ASSET is a measure of risk behavior based on the percentage of risky assets (bonds, shares, and mutual funds) over all the household's assets. In the empirical regression, self-reported risk attitude (the second risk measure) is introduced in all regressions except for Germany through two dummy variables, i.e., RISK3 (which equals 1 if individuals are willing to take average risks) and RISK4 (which equals 1 if individuals are not willing to take any risks). The reference group consists of people who reported to be willing to take \"substantial\" or \"above-average\" risks. So, RISK3 and RISK4 indicate increasing levels of risk aversion. In the Italian data these two variables are calculated using the household heads response on a reservation price of an investment opportunity question. This allows us to construct a measure of absolute risk aversion (see Online Appendix); although the theoretical prediction is formulated with relative risk aversion, we use absolute risk aversion, as the risk dummies are not identified as relative measures either and multiplying with wealth would add much measurement error. 9 In the German SOEP data we do not have the necessary information on individual possession of financial assets. There is however information on self-reported risk attitudes. The information on self-reported risk attitudes in the German data set differs slightly from that in the SCF. In the SOEP, respondents are asked to report their willingness to take risks in a variety of areas, such as financial matters, health, occupation, and leisure and sport. We base our results on the willingness to take risks in the occupation, obviously the relevant domain. The answer to the willingness to take risk is recorded on a 0-10 scale, where 0 stands for complete unwilling to take risks and 10 for completely willing (see Dohmen et al. 2011, for validity issues). In other words, risk attitudes are measured through a categorical variable that can take 7 We considered restricting our sample to 3-year-stayers only, but that leaves us with only 202 observations (down from 758). Non-linear regressions did not converge and almost all variables in Table 2 had insignificant coefficients. 8 Hourly earnings is the common unit in analysis of wage differentials. This is less than satisfactory, as most labour markets do not operate on an hourly basis and many jobs have implicit contracts with undetermined hours and unspecified relationship between hours and pay. In our Italian dataset we get good results with annual earnings in all specifications; this is not the case with hourly earnings. 9 The model predicts inverse proportionality between wage growth and risk attitude. We follow Shaw in estimating with direct proportionality. In the Italian dataset, using the inverse of risky asset share also gives significant results. 11 values. Since in the model risk attitudes are interacted with the human capital variables, introducing risk attitudes through a dummy variable approach makes the results very difficult to interpret. Therefore, we opt for transforming risk attitudes into a variable that can take values on the whole real axis by following Terza (1987) and include the transformed variables in the regression as any other continuous variable.",

In the German case, control variables consist of three dummy variables that take value 1 if the respondent lives in East Germany, is of German origin (as opposed to immigrant), and is a male. The first two dummy variables are added to represent the ethnic component in the German sample. The gender variable included in the regression is defined as in the US case. In Italy, the controls included in vector H i are dummies for region (North, Center, and South), gender, marital status, and part time work. In Spain, there are four dummy variables indicating whether the individual works for a big firm (more than 500 workers), is a male, has a non-permanent contract and is single. The dummy variables big firm, no permanent contract, and single are included to represent the importance of the insider-outsider effects in Spain (outsiders are young rather than old, have a temporary rather than a permanent contract and work in small firms rather than in big firms).",

This variety is an inevitable shortcoming of our tests. We know that the different measures correlate, but far from perfectly (Ding et al. 2010). Imperfect correlation leads to noise in the comparison with results for Italy and Germany, but not for Spain and the US. It is hard to predict how large the effect may be. Empirical research indicates that risk attitudes are domain specific (Slovic 1972;Warneryd 1996;Weber et al. 2002;Dohmen et al. 2005;Ding et al. 2010). Dohmen et al.

This means that the Spanish data resemble Shaw's sub-sample of job stayers. Empirically, this implies that the changes in tenure are equal to changes in experience and the (linear) effects of experience on wage growth cannot be disentangled from the (linear) effects of tenure. Thus we refer to the relevant variable as change in years of tenure/years of experience.  Table 3 shows that Shaw's initial results cannot unequivocally be reproduced. Consider first the results on the core theme, the mediating effect of risk attitude on investment intensity. When we measure risk attitude through asset holdings, the theory is confirmed for the US and for Spain, but not for Italy. For the US, the magnitude of the effect is similar to the original estimate (1.116 against 1.04). With direct measures of risk attitude, the model is clearly rejected for Germany and support in Spain is weak. In the US, more risk averse workers still have lower wage growth, but the most risk averse (Risk4) have no longer a wage growth that differs from those who love to take risk. For Italy, with the measure of absolute risk aversion, the prediction is strongly supported. Thus, the replication results are mixed, even for the US. In the European countries, either the dummy measure has the predicted effects or the asset measure has, but not both. In Germany we have only one measure and it does not have the predicted effect.",

These patterns are only weakly reproduced. The positive effect of change in tenure is found for Spain in both specifications, in the US for assets and in Germany at low level of significance (8%). The change in tenure squared is never significant except for Italy in the specification that uses absolute risk aversion. Only the change in experience squared is solidly negative except for Italy.

In her test, however, Shaw shows that heteroscedasticity is rejected (cf. p. 639). She does not pay much attention to it, although in fact it strikes at the heart of the model: the theory explicitly implies heteroscedasticity. We use the same test (White and Domowitz 1984) 14 and present the results in the penultimate row (with the heading \u03c7 2 statistic) of Table 3. We find significant levels of heterocedasticity in all specifications and countries. Thus, we now find support for the model where Shaw did not. 15 As heteroscedasticity is an important feature of the model, we regressed the squared residual from the regressions in Table 3 on risk attitude, schooling, experience, and tenure. Results are reported in Table 4. Risk attitude is indeed related to the residual variance, but only in three out of the seven specifications. 16 In the Asset specification, there is never a significant effect, in the dummy and absolute risk aversion specification we find higher residual variance for the less risk averse, except for Spain, where there is no significant relationship at all. Education increases residual variance in the US, but not in the other countries. Men, remarkably, have lower residual variance in the US and Germany but not elsewhere. Tenure has no effect in the US, positive effect in Spain but negative effect in Germany and a weakly significant non-linear effect in Italy.

Starting from this most general specification (13), we consider three questions. The first question is whether risk is a relevant variable at all in the countries we study. This is a simple test of significance on coefficients relating to risk, \u03b8 . The second question is whether the assignment of variables to X (interaction) and to H (no interaction) is accepted by the data. The null hypothesis here is that \u03b8 j = 0 for some j so that the interaction with risk is not relevant, for variables such as male, union, and black. The third question is whether the parameter constraints on the interaction terms are acceptable. Equations 11 and 12 follow from restrictions on (13). Estimation results for Eq. 13 are given in Online Appendix B, Tables B3a-B3d. We will now seek an answer to our three questions.",

(2009)) use data on American twins' risk preferences (answers to three questions on hypothetical investments) and find that about two thirds of economic risk preferences are genetically determined. Cesarini et al. (2008), using data on Swedish twins, report that 25% of variation in financial risk taking (choosing the degree of risk in the pension wealth portfolio) is due to genetic influences. Moreover, these findings are consistent with extensive research within the field of psychology showing that adults' personality traits, including those related to risk attitudes, are fairly stable over time (see the meta-analyses by Roberts andDel Vecchio 2000, andCosta andMcCrae 2002).",

However, risk attitude is not a directly observable variable and actual measurement may be subject to many influences. As Wooldridge (2002, pp. 73-76) points out, this is no problem if the measurement error is uncorrelated with the actual measure. But if the measurement error is assumed uncorrelated with true unobserved risk attitude, we have classical errors in variables and the estimated coefficient is biased downwards. This, of course, is a problem for Shaw's original estimates as well and the relevant question that remains is whether the problem is more relevant in our estimates than in hers. We have no priori reason to assume that this will be the case, but better understanding of the properties of risk attitude measures would be most welcome.",

            "text": "Our conclusion from this paper is that continuing the line of research is promising. Both intuition and direct observation as well as empirical research indicate that risk taking is relevant in the labour market and that risk attitudes will matter. Our replication has shown that the initial support for the Shaw model does not extend to other settings. This forces us to reconsider how risk attitudes and wages are connected. We have made a start in Budria et al. (2010), with a model that takes the life-cycle investment profile as given by standard human capital theory and focuses on the mix between safe and risky human capital. We find that support for the model is stronger for a regression in wage levels than in wage changes. But clearly, more work is needed. In particular, it would seem important to reflect on the possible channels of transmission of risk attitude on wages and wage growth. One may think of participation in training, the nature of training programs (one type of training may provide more protection in the labour market than another) and of mobility, between jobs and employers. Job mobility may involve taking on new risks (although this depends on the labour contract) and we also know that voluntary movers usually have higher wage growth than stayers (see e.g., Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez and Rebollo 2005). But also within firms, depending on the level and the nature of the job, there will be scope for more or less risky actions and initiatives and this may impact on careers. Charting his territory will be an interesting next step. Differentiating by stage of the business cycle may also be relevant, as both risk taking and risk sharing may vary over the cycle.",
