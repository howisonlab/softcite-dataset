            "text": "BACKGROUND: High BCAR4 and ERBB2 mRNA levels in primary breast cancer associate with tamoxifen resistance and poor patient outcome. We determined whether BCAR4 expression sensitises breast cancer cells to lapatinib, and identifies a subgroup of patients who possibly may benefit from ERBB2-targeted therapies despite having tumours with low ERBB2 expression. METHODS: Proliferation assays were applied to determine the effect of BCAR4 expression on lapatinib treatment. Changes in cell signalling were quantified with reverse-phase protein microarrays. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of ERBB2 and BCAR4 was performed in 1418 primary breast cancers. Combined BCAR4 and ERBB2 mRNA levels were evaluated for association with progression-free survival (PFS) in 293 oestrogen receptor-a (ER)-positive patients receiving tamoxifen as first-line monotherapy for recurrent disease. RESULTS: BCAR4 expression strongly sensitised ZR-75-1 and MCF7 breast cancer cells to the combination of lapatinib and antioestrogens. Lapatinib interfered with phosphorylation of ERBB2 and its downstream mediators AKT, FAK, SHC, STAT5, and STAT6. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that 27.6% of the breast cancers were positive for BCAR4 and 22% expressed also low levels of ERBB2. The clinical significance of combining BCAR4 and ERBB2 mRNA status was underscored by the finding that the group of patients having BCAR4-positive/ERBB2-low-expressing cancers had a shorter PFS on tamoxifen treatment than the BCAR4-negative group. CONCLUSION: This study shows that BCAR4 expression identifies a subgroup of ER-positive breast cancer patients without overexpression of ERBB2 who have a poor outcome and might benefit from combined ERBB2-targeted and antioestrogen therapy.",

            "text": "Tamoxifen has an important role in the treatment of patients with oestrogen receptor-a (ER)-positive primary breast cancer, both in the adjuvant and metastatic setting (Davies et al, 2011). Its efficacy is limited by primary (intrinsic) or secondary (acquired) resistance. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved is required to overcome resistance and for developing more effective therapies. Several genes and mechanism causing antioestrogen resistance were identified (Dorssers and Veldscholte, 1997;Van Agthoven et al, 1998;Brinkman et al, 2000;Massarweh and Schiff, 2007;Riggins et al, 2007;Musgrove and Sutherland, 2009;Barone et al, 2010;Van Agthoven et al, 2010), including the novel breast cancer antioestrogen resistance 4 (BCAR4) gene (Meijer et al, 2006). Ectopic expression of BCAR4 causes antioestrogen resistance, anchorage independence, and tumour growth in nude mice (Meijer et al, 2006;Godinho et al, 2011). BCAR4 mRNA is detected in 22-29% of primary breast cancers. High levels are associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with tamoxifen for recurrent disease, and associate with poor metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS), reflecting tumour aggressiveness (Godinho et al, 2010).",

            "text": "BCAR4 has been found in several mammalian species, being well conserved in higher primates (Meijer et al, 2006;Godinho et al, 2011). In the functional screening for genes causing tamoxifen resistance, it was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library only (Meijer et al, 2006;Godinho et al, 2011). Searches in public expression databases and in the literature showed that high BCAR4 expression is only found in placenta and the oocyte (Meijer et al, 2006;Godinho et al, 2011). In other normal adult tissues, expression of BCAR4 was not found. The species and tissuespecific expression strongly indicates a role for BCAR4 in mammalian early development and pregnancy. Surprisingly, the BCAR4 gene is absent in the mouse and rat (Godinho et al, 2011). Important differences exist between human and mouse placental development and function. In the mouse, in contrast to the human situation, trophoblast implantation is superficial, the transformation of the uterine arteries depends on maternal factors, and mouse placenta produces fewer placental hormones (Malassine et al, 2003;Carter, 2007). At this point it is only possible to speculate on the function of this gene, but it is likely that differences in placental development and function could explain the absence in these organisms. BCAR4 may have a function in placenta and early development, therefore it cannot be excluded that in mouse and rat its function has been taken over by other genes.",

We hypothesised that BCAR4 expression may sensitise breast cancer cells to the small-molecule tyrosine kinase activity inhibitor of EGFR and ERBB2. In this study, BCAR4-expressing cells were assessed for their sensitivity to lapatinib, given alone and in combination with antioestrogens. In addition, the effects of treatment on ERBB2 and ERBB3 downstream signalling were measured. As increased ERBB2 activity has been associated with resistance to cytotoxic agents in breast cancer, the impact of BCAR4 expression on sensitivity to several cytotoxic drugs was assessed. The results of our cell line studies showed that ectopic expression of BCAR4 results in activation of the ERBB2 signalling pathway without overexpression of ERBB2. Therefore, we determined the incidence of breast cancers expressing BCAR4 and low ERBB2 levels, and how this group of patients fares when treated with tamoxifen for advanced disease.",

In MCF7 cells, we investigated whether BCAR4 expression also induces ERBB2/3-mediated proliferation. The expression of the four ERBB receptors were inhibited with siRNAs, in the absence or presence of the pure antioestrogen ICI182,780. In contrast to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, this antioestrogen fully inhibits growth of wild-type MCF7 cells. Inhibition of mRNA transcripts was verified by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, and was more than 70% for EGFR, 88% for ERBB2, 66% for ERBB3, and 75% for ERBB4.",

Moreover, phosphorylation of ERBB2 and downstream targets is inhibited in the presence of oestradiol and lapatinib. The addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen increased ERBB2 levels and downstream signalling. Therefore, we hypothesised that if the ERBB2 signalling pathway is inhibited by lapatinib, BCAR4-expressing cells may switch to the ER pathway to sustain survival and proliferation. To test this, we analysed the effects of lapatinib treatment on oestradiol dependence in short-term cultures. While ZR/BCAR4 cells showed maximal proliferation capacity in the absence of oestradiol ( Figure 4A), ZR/vector cells required supplementation of 10-100 pM of oestradiol. Figure 4B shows that in the presence of 0.01 or 0.1 mM lapatinib, oestrogen dependence of ZR/vector cells remained unchanged. In contrast, proliferation of ZR/BCAR4 cells was less inhibited by lapatinib in the presence of more than 10 pM of oestradiol ( Figure 4A). These results indicate that ZR/BCAR4 cells can evade the growth inhibitory effects of lapatinib in part through ER signalling.",

The individual clinical associations of BCAR4 and ERBB2 mRNA levels for PFS (Table 1) were in agreement with our previous data (Van Agthoven et al, 2009;Godinho et al, 2010). Univariate Cox regression analysis of the combined mRNA status showed that patients with BCAR4-positive tumours with low levels of ERBB2 had a shorter PFS than patients with BCAR4-negative tumours with low ERBB2 levels (HR \u00bc 1.64, P \u00bc 0.001; Table 1). Patients with high ERBB2 levels had the shortest PFS, regardless of BCAR4 status ( Table 1). The Kaplan-Meier analysis visualises the different outcomes of the patients stratified according to the combined BCAR4 and ERBB2 status ( Figure 5B). In the multivariate analysis, the power of the combination of BCAR4 expression and low levels of ERBB2 was independent of the traditional predictive factors for PFS (BCAR4-negative/ERBB2-low vs BCAR4-positive/ERBB2-low, HR \u00bc 1.50, P \u00bc 0.011; Table 1).",

All patients had ER-positive, lymph nodenegative cancer and did not receive adjuvant systemic therapy, allowing the analysis of the natural course of the disease. The mRNA levels were analysed for association with the end points MFS and OS. Metastasis-free survival in patients with BCAR4positive/ERBB2-low tumours was not significantly different from patients with BCAR4-negative/ERBB2-low tumours.  Lysates were analysed with reverse-phase protein microarrays. The heatmap presents the different total and phosphorylated proteins (n \u00bc 31; vertical axis) that showed at least two-fold difference with the vector control cultured in the presence of oestradiol (colour version in Supplementary Figure 1 and protein data in Supplementary Table 1). Higher relative levels are represented in white; lower levels in black. Cells were cultured with oestradiol (E) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (T), or T and EGF (T \u00fe ) and treated for 17 h, without, or with 0.01 or 0.1 mM lapatinib (triangles represent increasing lapatinib concentrations, from left to right).

As BCAR4 expression in cell lines did not change the sensitivity to different chemotherapeutic agents, the increased sensitivity to lapatinib is not due to a general mechanism of drug resistance. The combination of lapatinib and tamoxifen treatment is more effective at inhibiting breast cancer cell growth than lapatinib alone (Chu et al, 2005;Leary et al, 2010). Also in our BCAR4-expressing cell models, the combination of lapatinib and antioestrogens was more potent in inhibiting cell growth than lapatinib alone; indicating that blocking the ERBB2 pathway with lapatinib re-sensitises BCAR4-expressing cells to antioestrogens.",

In culture medium containing lapatinib without oestradiol growth of ZR/BCAR4 cells was strongly inhibited. This suggests that BCAR4 cells use the ER signalling pathway to survive in the presence of low concentrations of lapatinib.

BCAR4 may encode a very small protein, and its predicted anchor signal and two transmembrane domains suggest that the protein is located at cell membranes. Because of its possible location and interaction with ERBB receptors, there is a possibility that BCAR4 may be a target for ADAM proteins, which cleave ERBB ligands (Mochizuki, 2007). This way, cleaved BCAR4 would be free to bind ERBB3, activating ERBB2 and ERBB3 signalling. BCAR4 may interact with ERBB2 through the cell membrane, similar to MUC4 (Carraway et al, 2001). A mechanism similar to nucleolin, which interacts intracellular and activates the ERBB receptors (Di Segni et al, 2008). The hypothesis that BCAR4 may be a secreted protein can also not be excluded. Another possibility is that the BCAR4 protein interacts with and stabilises the ERBB2/ERBB3 dimer, or interferes with the internalisation and/or intracellular transport of the receptors. It has been shown that mucins can influence receptor trafficking and localisation, and because of that, can modulate receptor tyrosine kinase signalling (Funes et al, 2006).",

EGFR is not involved in our cell models of endocrine resistance because oestrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 and MCF7 cells are devoid of detectable EGFR expression (Van Agthoven et al, 1992), and ERBB2 is present but not overexpressed nor amplified (Hollestelle et al, 2010). Introduction of BCAR4 activates ERBB2 signalling and induces resistance against antioestrogens (Van Agthoven et al, 2012). This suggests that not only ERBB2 overexpression or amplification is associated with tamoxifen resistance, but that the mere activation of the receptor may also have a role in the process. This is in agreement with earlier findings that other models of endocrine resistance, LTED and LTAM cells, showed increased activation of ERBB2 and downstream signalling (Leary et al, 2010). In addition, it has been hypothesised that moderate, as well as low ERBB2 levels, may generate a strong mitogenic signal when the receptor is activated by dimerisation with EGFR or ERBB3 (Frogne et al, 2009).",

This concentration is achieved in the plasma of patients treated with the recommended daily dose of 1.5 mg (Burris et al, 2005), emphasising the potential feasibility of lapatinib as treatment for antioestrogen resistant breast cancer due to BCAR4 expression. Activated ERBB2 has been found in ER-positive tumours classified as negative for ERBB2 expression according to the standard criteria (Frogne et al, 2009). Moreover, emerging evidence shows that some tumours scoring negative for ERBB2 expression benefit from trastuzumab therapy (Paik et al, 2008;Esteva et al, 2010). At present, treatment with ERBB2-targeted therapies is restricted to patients with breast cancers overexpressing ERBB2. Until now, there are no biomarkers to select patients with ER-positive/ERBB2-negative tumours, which are dependent on ERBB2 signalling (Mayer and Arteaga, 2010), and may benefit from ERBB2-targeted therapies. Although it has been shown that the combination of lapatinib and an aromatase inhibitor is not beneficial for ERBB2-negative, endocrine sensitive or endocrine naive metastatic breast cancer patients (Johnston et al, 2009), this remains to be established for BCAR4-positive tumours.",
