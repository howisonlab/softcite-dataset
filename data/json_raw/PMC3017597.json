Although the chromatin domain concept is generally accepted, only little is known on how domain organization impacts the regulation of differential gene expression. Insulators might hold answers to address this issue as they delimit and organize chromatin domains. We have previously identified a CTCF-dependent insulator with enhancer-blocking activity embedded in the 5 0 non-coding region of the chicken a-globin domain. Here, we demonstrate that this element, called the aEHS-1.4 insulator, protects a transgene against chromosomal position effects in stably transfected cell lines and transgenic mice. We found that this insulator can create a regulated chromatin environment that coincides with the onset of adult a-globin gene expression. Furthermore, such activity is in part dependent on the in vivo regulated occupancy of CTCF at the aEHS-1.4 element. Insulator function is also regulated by CTCF poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Our results suggest that the aEHS-1.4 insulator contributes in organizing the chromatin structure of the a-globin gene domain and prevents activation of adult a-globin gene expression at the erythroblast stage via CTCF.",

Not only does it require chromatin structure remodeling at local regulatory elements, but also the establishment of a chromatin architecture defining the domain itself. Consequently, more than proximal and distal regulatory elements are required for a gene's coordinated transcription in order to first demarcate the genomic region in which it is located. Once the chromatin domain is delimited and organized, local regulatory actions take place to achieve expression of specific genes (1).",

            "text": "Insulators have been considered as regulatory elements that act as boundaries to the action of external enhancers and repressive chromatin and participate in the formation and maintenance of chromatin domains (1,2). Accumulated evidence suggests that insulators, particularly CTCF-linked insulators, do not act exclusively as boundary elements (3). For example, CTCF in coordination with cohesins, mediate the formation of chromatin loops favoring optimal spatial organization of gene domains (4,5). This vision is further supported by the presence of insulator bodies that are important for domain formation at the nuclear periphery of Drosophila cells. Insulator bodies are formed of polymorphic protein complexes including dCTCF, Su(Hw) and CP190, besides other proteins (6). Interestingly, such insulator-mediated topological organization of the genome is dynamic. For instance, CTCF and cohesin mediate chromosomal cis contacts in a regulated manner in several loci. Such loci include the Igf2/H19 imprinted locus (7,8), the cytokine locus including IL4, IL5, IL13 and IFNG (9), the mouse b-globin locus, in which the spatial organization of regulatory components to form an active chromatin hub is facilitated by CTCF during tissue-specific activation of globin genes (10), the MHC class II genes (11) and more recently, the b-globin locus, which interacts with flanking olfactory receptor genes on the human chromosome 11 (5). Notoriously, such interactions are not exclusively intrachromosomal, CTCF also mediates interchromosomal contacts between one allele of the Igf2/H19 imprinting control region on chromosome 7 and one allele of the Wsb1/Nf1 imprinted locus on chromosome 11 (12). Insulator action through CTCF enhancer blocking activity can also be regulated by other mechanisms as by thyroid hormone (13) and post-translational modifications as poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (14) among others. Thus, CTCF is implicated in diverse regulatory and structural functions (3).",

This element, named aEHS-1.4, which corresponds to a DNA fragment of 1.4 kb is an insulator with CTCF-dependent enhancer-blocking activity (15). This insulator is located within an intron of the C16orf35 gene antisense transcript (16,17), between the distal locus control region known as the a-major regulatory element (a-MRE), and the a-globin genes ( Figure 1A). Since the aEHS-1.4 is located 3 0 from the a-MRE it seemed unlikely that the aEHS-1.4 insulator element acts as a boundary for the 5 0 -side of the a-globin domain, shielding it from silent chromatin expansion or from the action of enhancers outside the domain. Consequently, we addressed the contribution of this element to the chromatin configuration of the a-globin domain and for regulated gene expression during erythropoiesis and development.",

In parallel, the corresponding Ecl XI-Sal I 11.6-kb DNA band from ptrTYR5, without the insulator element, was also purified and used as the reference control for transgenesis. The resulting DNA fragments and transgenes were named as: TYR5 and TYR5-aEHS-1.4, respectively. For the generation of transgenic mice, suitable DNA solutions from each of the two transgenes were microinjected into the pronucleus of albino outbreed NMRI/Hsd fertilized mouse oocytes (Harlan Interfauna Iberica SL, Barcelona, Spain) using standard procedures (25) . Transgenic founder mice were detected at birth due to obvious pigmentation (24) and confirmed by PCR analysis, using tyrosinase minigene-specific primers, as described before (24) and also by Southern blot analysis, using the pmTyrE5 tyrosinase probe that reveals polymorphic Hind III DNA bands between the transgene (3.4 kb) and the endogenous tyrosinase locus (2.2 kb), as reported (26). Transgenic mouse lines were established and maintained, as hemizygous, in the albino outbreed NMRI/Hsd genetic background. Transgene copy-number was determined from the DNA of F 1 individuals by Southern blot analysis, as reported before (26). For the TYR5-aEHS-1.4 construct, 289 fertilized oocytes were microinjected, 192 embryos were transferred to pseudopregnant females and resulted in the birth of 17 pups, out of which five independent transgenic mouse lines were established. For the TYR5 transgene, 581 fertilized oocytes were microinjected, 284 embryos were transferred and gave rise to 17 newborns, out of which three were transgenic. Subsequently, two of these mouse lines were found to carry multiple transgene insertions that could be segregated in the F1 generation, thus finally resulting in a total of six independent transgenic mouse lines with the TYR5 construct. Representative F 1 individuals from each transgenic mouse line were briefly anesthetized with 1 ml/100 g of a mixture of Ketamine (10 mg/ml) and Xylazine (2 mg/ml) for obtaining the arranged pictures (Figure 2A). All the procedures that required the use of animals complied with Spanish and European legislation concerning vivisection and the use of genetically modified organisms, and the protocols were approved by the local ethics committees on animal experimentation.

As controls we used regions in which the analyzed histone covalent modification or nuclear factor is absent; for permissive chromatin histone marks and CTCF we used two heterochromatinassociated sequences located 5 0 of the chicken b-globin gene domain (30), for the repressive histone marks we used the b-globin 5 0 cHS4 insulator sequence that is enriched with permissive marks in all cell types used (30). Enrichment was calculated by using the following equation: Ab test (test region/control region)/IgG (test region/control region). The antibodies employed were the following: antibodies against acetylated histone H3 and acetylated histone H4 (06-599 and 06-866) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The antibody against H3K4me2 (ab7766) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA).

Three of them were designed from the reported sequences in (31) (pSiLefevre1, 2 and 3) and one was kindly provided by Ishihara (pCTI). Even though the pCT1 shRNAi was designed against human CTCF (32), it reduced CTCF levels in the chicken cell lines. Plasmids containing the hairpin DNAs were stably transfected as described previously, and integrants were selected with 1 mg/ml puromicin (SIGMA) for 7-15 days. CTCF reduction was assessed by western blot analysis (Supplementary Figure S4A). For 3-aminobenzamide (3-ABA) treatment, 8 mM 3-ABA was added to the culture media for 3-6 days prior to evaluation by western blotting and ChIP analysis, as described (14). The CTCF antibody used to perform the western blot (15) recognizes both the 130-and 180-kDa forms of CTCF as shown in Supplementary Figure S4A.",

The D -GFP flanked on each side by the 5 0 cHS4 core insulator of the b-globin locus was used as control (18). Transgene integrity and copy number (single-or multi-copy) was determined by Southern blot for a selected set of stable lines (data not shown). We measured GFP fluorescence by flow cytometry at different time points to assess transgene expression (18,23). As expected, the D -GFP plasmid (without insulators) showed sensitivity to CPE, as transgene expression was extinct even before day 100 of continuous cell culture ( Figure 1B). In contrast, the aEHS-1.4 insulator robustly protected against CPE even after 100 days of continuous cell culture ( Figure 1D). This protective activity was comparable to that exerted by the chicken b-globin 5 0 cHS4 insulator ( Figure 1C-E). Next, we examined the profile of histone post-translational modifications present over the GFP transgene in distinct cell lines by ChIP. Modifications corresponding to a permissive chromatin environment were present only in insulated transgenes (Supplementary Figure S1). Thus, the aEHS-1.4 insulator efficiently protects against CPE in chicken HD3 erythroblasts cells thereby favoring a transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment.",

A very high proportion of cells from lines in which GFP was flanked on each side by the aEHS-1.4 insulator showed high levels of fluorescence even after 70 days of continuous culture. In contrast, fluorescence levels decreased in an important proportion of cells carrying the mutant insulator aEHS-1.4\u00c1\u00c1 after 70 days ( Figure 3A). These results are reflected in the percentages of GFP-expressing cells in selected stably transfected lines ( Figure 3A). Interestingly, the protection against CPE by a single copy of the intact, or the mutant aEHS-1.4, was less efficient than by multiple copies, suggesting that optimal insulation is reached only when the aEHS-1.4 sequence flanks the transgene on each side ( Figure 3A, compare single-and multi-copy cell lines). Thus, the mutant aEHS-1.4\u00c1\u00c1 insulator protects against CPE less efficiently than the aEHS-1.4 insulator, suggesting that, unlike the chicken 5 0 cHS4 b-globin insulator (18), CTCF binding is required for the insulator function of aEHS-1.4.",

Therefore, we asked if the aEHS-1.4 element regulates a-globin gene expression and if it does so via CTCF. For these purpose we first addressed the CTCF binding to the endogenous aEHS-1.4 during erythroid differentiation and chicken development by semi-quantitative ChIP. Interestingly, the occupancy of the aEHS-1.4 insulator by CTCF varied depending on the differentiation stage analyzed. CTCF abundance peaked at the pre-erythroblasts stage, represented by HD3 cells, and, it drastically diminished as differentiation proceeds into a mature erythrocyte, represented by red blood cells from 10-day-old chicken embryos (10dRBCs), or differentiated HD3 cells ( Figure 3B). Western blots showed similar CTCF total protein levels in undifferentiated and differentiated HD3 cells (Supplementary Figure S4A, right panel), suggesting regulated binding of CTCF to the aEHS-1.4 element. In contrast to the aEHS-1.4 insulator, the CTCF's highest enrichment on the chicken 5 0 cHS4 b-globin insulator was detected in 10dRBCs ( Supplementary Figure S3), suggesting a different mode of action of CTCF for each of these elements. Next, we analyzed the protective function of the aEHS-1.4 insulator against CPE in undifferentiated A B D C Figure 3. CTCF is necessary for aEHS-1.4 insulator function and its in vivo occupancy varies during erythroid differentiation. (A) Transgene expression analysis by FACS at day 0 (red) and 70 (grey) in cultured cell lines with the respective transgene integrated in multi-copy (aEHS-1.4 and mutant aEHS-1.4\u00c1\u00c1 insulator were placed only at the 5 0 -side of the transgene). Quantification of the average (\u00b1standard error) of GFP + cells at day 0 and 70 of culture of the set of single-and multi-copy clones. aEHS-1.4 (sc) n = 16; aEHS-1.4\u00c1\u00c1 (sc) n = 22; aEHS-1.4 (mc) n = 18 and aEHS-1.4\u00c1\u00c1 (mc) n = 22. *P 0.05 with respect to the aEHS-1.4 (ANOVA). (B) CTCF in vivo binding at the aEHS-1.4 insulator sequence was estimated by semi-quantitative ChIP assays (29). We observed an enrichment peak of CTCF in HD3 cells (erythroblasts), and as differentiation proceeds (dif-HD3), CTCF dissociates from the insulator. *P 0.05. The number of independent ChIP assays per cell line is: DT40 n = 3, 6C2 n = 5, HD3 n = 4, 5dRBC n = 3, 10dRBC n = 3 and dif-HD3 n = 4.

(D) ChIP using an antibody against CTCF and primers recognizing the transgene. CTCF binds to the transgene in HD3 cells and is dissociated in differentiated HD3 cells mimicking what happens at the endogenous context (see B), consistent with a loss of insulator function in the differentiated clones.

Results are shown as averages (\u00b1standard error). *P 0.05 with respect to the lines 506 or 528 (ANOVA). cells (HD3) and terminally differentiated erythroblasts (dif-HD3). Two HD3 cell lines carrying the D -GFP transgene shielded by the aEHS-1.4 (lines 506 and 528) were differentiated for 15 days (21), and GFP fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. GFP fluorescence of the differentiated cells reproducibly decreased as compared to their undifferentiated counterpart ( Figure 3C). This correlates with decreased occupancy of the endogenous aEHS-1.4 insulator by CTCF in 10dRBCs ( Figure 3B), and of the transgene incorporated in differentiated HD3 cells ( Figure 3D). In contrast, differentiated HD3 lines carrying the 5 0 cHS4 b-globin insulator did not show a significant fluorescence decrease (Supplementary Figure S3B). Therefore, the decreased protective effect of the aEHS-1.4 against CPE might be due to decreased CTCF binding.",

            "text": "Based on the data supporting dynamic CTCF binding at the aEHS-1.4 insulator during differentiation, we decided to knock down CTCF expression and inhibit its potential poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (Supplementary Figure S4). First, we generated a series of cell lines in which CTCF was stably knocked down by transfection of three different sets of small hairpin RNAs. Decreased CTCF protein was confirmed by western blot (Supplementary Figure S4A, left panel). The reduction of CTCF decreased the protective effect of the aEHS-1.4 insulator against CPE (Supplementary Figure S4B, left panel). ChIP assays confirmed decreased CTCF at the aEHS-1.4 insulator upon CTCF knock down (Supplementary Figure S4C). Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has been shown to be needed for CTCF insulator function (14,(34)(35)(36)(37), therefore we addressed whether inactivation of CTCF by inhibition of the poly(ADP) ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) impacts on the protection against CPE conferred by the aEHS-1.4 insulator. PARP-1 post-translationally modifies CTCF by adding ADP polymers to its N-terminal domain, resulting in two electrophoretic forms, one migrating at 130 kDa, which contains few ADP-ribose residues, and the other one migrating at 180 kDa, which contains more than 20 ADP-ribose residues (36). Treatment of the HD3 transgenic cell lines 506 and 528, which carry GFP flanked on each side by the aEHS-1.4 insulator, with 3-ABA, an inhibitor of PARP-1 (36), resulted in a diminishment of transgene protection against CPE along with a decrease of the 180 kDa form of CTCF (Supplementary Figure S4A, right panel). Interestingly, inhibition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation did not affect CTCF binding to the aEHS-1.4 insulator, as shown by ChIP ( Figure 6A), implying that, while affecting its function on the aEHS-1.4 insulator, inhibition of CTCF PARylation does not affect its DNA-binding properties.",

            "text": "As a first approach to understand the function of aEHS-1.4 element on the chromatin organization of the a-globin domain, we characterized the chromatin structure of a 6.6-kb genomic region encompassing the aEHS-1.4 element during erythroid differentiation and development ( Figure 4A). We performed ChIP assays for several histone post-translational modifications corresponding to transcriptionally permissive (acH3, acH4, H3K4me2 and H3K79me2) and repressive (H3K9me3 and H4K20me3) chromatin conformations. We found that the enrichment in histone modifications along the targeted genomic region varies during adult erythroid differentiation ( Figure 4A). In 6C2 cells, which represent a pre-erythroblast differentiation stage, a modest enrichment in acetylated histones, as well as H3K4me2 and H3K79me2 was observed over the aEHS-1.4 insulator ( Figure 4A). As differentiation proceeds into an erythroblast stage represented by HD3 cells, there was a notorious peak of permissive histone marks overlapping with the CTCF-binding sequence at the aEHS-1.4 element ( Figure 4A). Importantly, a-globin genes are not transcribed in 6C2 or HD3 cells (21). Thus, these results suggest that the aEHS-1.4 element may contribute to the establishment of an open configuration of the domain prior to adult a-globin gene expression. Such hypothesis is further supported by notorious enrichment of transcriptionally permissive histone modifications on the same genomic region in 5dRBC [ Figure 4B, CTCF(P2)], in which the embryonic p gene is transcribed (21). Then, the 6.6-kb genomic region encompassing the aEHS-1.4 insulator structures as transcriptionally permissive chromatin after globin gene expression switching, i.e. in 10dRBCs, when the adult a-globin genes ( D and A ) are robustly expressed, while the embryonic gene is silenced (21). The DT40 lymphoid cell line, in which the a-globin gene domain is inactive, was used as a control (21,38). Thus, the progressive arrangement of the 6.6-kb genomic region containing the aEHS-1.4 insulator into transcriptionally permissive chromatin correlates with a-globin locus activation and the onset of adult a-globin gene expression. These results are in contrast to the timing of aEHS-1.4 insulator function and CTCF occupancy, which rise in erythroblasts, and decrease in mature erythrocytes ( Figure 3B).",

            "text": "A similar set of experiments was performed in cells treated with 3-ABA inhibitor of PARP-1 enzyme. Open chromatin histone modifications at the aEHS-1.4 insulator region were generally increased in undifferentiated HD3 cells in which CTCF function was inactivated by 3-ABA, as compared to untreated cells ( Figure 6A). Accordingly, HD3-treated cells showed premature activation of the adult D and A globin genes in contrast with CTCF knock-down cells ( Figure 6B). No significant differences in histone modifications or a-globin gene expression were found in treated differentiated HD3 cells. Two main conclusions emerge from this set of experiments. First, inhibition of CTCF poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in HD3 erythroblasts mimics, at least in part, the chromatin structure and the expression of the adult D and A globin genes in 10dRBCs ( Figures 4B and 6). Second, knock down of CTCF perturbs more dramatically the chromatin structure of the a-globin domain, as compared to inhibition of CTCF poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, while impeding full globin gene activation ( Figure 5B, right panel). Thus, it is possible that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation regulates the activity of CTCF on the aEHS-1.4 insulator at its natural context. Together, these results support a model in which the aEHS-1.4 promotes optimal chromatin configuration and prevents a-MRE-mediated adult a-globin genes trans-activation at the erythroblast stage.

We previously demonstrated that the aEHS-1.4 insulator, embedded in the 5 0 non-coding region of the a-globin domain, posses enhancer blocking activity (15). With the aim to better understand the insulator properties of the aEHS-1.4 element and its role in the chicken a-globin domain, we first demonstrate that the aEHS-1.4 element is able to shield a transgene from CPE in stably transfected cell lines and in mice in a CTCF-dependent manner. This differs from the 5 0 cHS4 insulator in which only enhancer blocking function is CTCF-dependent, whereas protection against CPE needs binding of USF1 and USF2 factors (18,39). Since no USF1/USF2 factors are present at the aEHS-1.4 (data not shown), a different protein complex most likely regulates aEHS-1.4 insulator activity.",

This raises the possibility that the aEHS-1.4 acts as a stage-specific insulator probably influencing the activity of the a-MRE on the expression of adult D and A genes. Indeed, the activity of aEHS-1.4 is regulated, and peaks during the switching from early to late adult erythroid differentiation, when an erythroid-specific signal might favor CTCF dissociation. We propose that the function of the aEHS-1.4 insulator is to block the activity of the a-MRE distal element during early adult erythroid differentiation. Once differentiation takes place, CTCF dissociates and open chromatin propagates 3 0 towards the gene cluster ( Figure 8A). Possibly the aEHS-1.4 element regulates the poised state of the RNA polymerase II and pre-initiation complex components found at the a-MRE (40). The RNA polymerase II blockage by CTCF has been described in other loci (41,42). In such a hypothetical scenario, CTCF release from the aEHS-1.4 insulator may favor the chromosomal conformation changes and the signal spreading needed for the interaction between the a-MRE and the adult D and A gene promoter regions and their transcriptional activation ( Figure 8B). This model represents a novel regulatory role for a CTCF-dependent chromatin insulator involved in a differentiation pathway. In summary, at the endogenous context the aEHS-1.4 insulator may have enhancer blocking activity (presumably over the a-MRE) and barrier function to contribute to chromatin structure changes at the domain scale. Such dual activity is thus in part CTCF-dependent, and probably can also be driven by different stage-specific nuclear factors.",

When PARP-1 is inhibited at the erythroblast stage we are able to mimic the effect of CTCF release during differentiation, i.e. an increase in histone open marks and the activation of the adult D and A globin genes ( Figure 6). In contrast, CTCF knock down do not cause the activation of any a-globin gene in erythroblasts ( Figure 5B) and impedes a-globin gene trans-activation at the differentiated stage. From these results several interpretations emerged. One predicts that CTCF poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation does not occur in all the CTCFs bound in vivo along the domain and that the CTCF located at the aEHS-1.4 insulator is modified post-translationally by PARP-1 (36). Furthermore, it is possible that not all CTCF associated complexes located along the domain possess the same peptidic composition and activity. This is an aspect that is currently under investigation. We predict that some CTCF-associated complexes are more structural and others, like the one linked to the aEHS-1.4, should have a regulatory function. Based on such predictions, it is now attractive to look for CTCF partners at different locations in the domain, including PARP-1.

Interestingly, the aEHS-1.4 element, located around \u00c014-kb upstream the embryonic p gene, is contained in the loop formed by contacts between the a-MRE and the \u00c09-kb DHS, thus the aEHS-1.4 element appears not to contribute directly to hub formation in this context. Whether alternative CTCF sites along the a-globin domain, which we recently identified Figure 8. Summary and model for the aEHS-1.4 insulator role at the chicken a-globin locus. (A) Summary of histone post-translational modifications and CTCF in vivo enrichment over the 6.6-kb genomic region containing the aEHS-1.4 insulator. As adult erythroid differentiation proceeds there is an increment in histone modifications corresponding to a permissive chromatin environment over the aEHS-1.4 insulator and the CTCF site (see P2 primer location) that expands and further increases over the entire region in 10dRBC when the adult genes D and A are switched on. CTCF is present during differentiation with a peak at the erythroblast stage (HD3 cells) and then released at the mature 10dRBC when the adult D and A genes are being expressed (see right side green graph bar). P1-P5 represent the primers covering the 6.6-kb genomic region used for ChIP assays and P2 are the primers located over the CTCF-binding site. (B) Model suggesting a mechanism of action for the aEHS-1.4 insulator at the level of the chromatin structure at the domain scale and adult a-globin gene expression. Vertical arrows represent DNase I hypersensitive sites. We propose that at the erythroblast stage the aEHS-1.4 insulator blocks the effects coming from the a-MRE concomitant with the fact that the adult D and A globin genes remain silenced. At the late erythrocyte stage CTCF dissociation from the insulator facilitates a-MRE activity allowing trans-activation of a-globin adult genes.",

We suggest that the regulated interaction of CTCF with its binding site could represent a way to control the function of the aEHS-1.4 element over a-globin genes expression, together with post-translational modifications like the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation that modulate CTCF activity. In terms of the chromatin configuration of the locus, multiple CTCF-binding sites and their associated factors may facilitate the formation of a chromatin hub in a regulated manner. Our results suggest that the intergenic regulatory and structural components of a chromatin domain are critical to achieve regulated gene expression.",
