            "text": "Macrophage-derived chemokine, CC motif chemokine 22 (MDC/CCL22), is one of the inflammatory chemokines that controls the movement of monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. Serum and skin MDC/CCL22 levels are elevated in atopic dermatitis, which suggests that the chemokines produced from keratinocytes are responsible for attracting inflammatory lymphocytes to the skin. A major signaling pathway in the interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)-stimulated inflammation response involves the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1). In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of dieckol and its possible action mechanisms in the category of skin inflammation including atopic dermatitis. Dieckol inhibited MDC/CCL22 production induced by IFN-\u03b3 (10 ng/mL) in a dose dependent manner. Dieckol (5 and 10 mM) suppressed the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of STAT1. These results suggest that dieckol exhibits anti-inflammatory effect via the down-regulation of STAT1 activation."

Chemokine is also known to be involved in generation and maturation of immune cells, and differentiation of T cells (Yoshie et al., 2001;Baumer et al., 2004). Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22) is a typical inflammatory chemokine and a ligand for CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), which is predominantly expressed on Th2 lymphocytes, basophils and natural killer cells (Yamashita and Kuroda, 2002;Saeki and Tamaki, 2006). Previous studies have shown that the MDC level is elevated in the serum and skin lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), suggesting that keratinocyte-generated chemokines are key mediators in the drawing of inflammatory lymphocytes to the skin (Maeda et al., 2002;Shimada et al., 2004;Jahnz-Rozyk et al., 2005).",

Upon binding to IFN-\u03b3, the IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFN-\u03b3R1 and IFN-\u03b3R2) rapidly associates with the Janus tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2. JAK1 and JAK2 phosphorylate one another and then subsequently phosphorylate the IFN-\u03b3 receptor, which leads to form a docking moiety for the cytoplasmic transcription factor named signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1, a member of the STAT protein family (Ivashkiv and Hu, 2004;Best et al., 2005) . It has been found that STAT1 phosphorylation plays a critical role in IFN-mediated innate immunity to microbial infection, especially inflammatory responses (Ju et al., 2009). It is also known that IFN-\u03b3 also stimulates the activation of p38 and extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), NF-\u03baB (Pearson et al., 2001;Madonna et al., 2008).",

E. cava has been attended as a potential producer of diverse natural materials such as alginic acids, phlorotannins and fucoidans which show useful activities in bio-industrial areas including medicine, cosmetics, and functional foods (Wijesinghe et al., 2011;Kang et al., 2012b;Kim et al., 2014). Phlorotannins (eckol, dieckol, and bieckol) isolated from E. species are representative components of marine secondary metabolites. Among them, dieckol is a phlorotannin compound consisting of a dimeric structure of polyphenolic compound eckol (Park et al., 2013). Dieckol has shown anti-oxidant (Lee et al., 2012), anti-cancer (Park and Jeon. 2012), anti-diabetic (Lee et al., 2012;Kang et al., 2013), hepatoprotective (Kang et al., 2012a), and anti-inflammatory effects (Yayeh et al., 2014). There are several studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of dieckol in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) (Choi et al., 2014). However, the biological effects of dieckol and its action mechanisms in skin inflammation including atopic dermatitis are poorly understood.",

The cells were treated with different concentrations of eckol and dieckol (12.5, 25, and 50 mM) for 24 h. Cell viability was determined using an EZ-cytox-enhanced cell viability assay kit. As shown in Fig. 2A and 2C, eckol and dieckol did not exhibit cytotoxicity to HaCaT keratinocytes at the tested concentrations. Then, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of eckol and dieckol on inflammatory chemokine (MDC) production in IFN-\u03b3 (10 ng/mL)-stimulated HaCaT keratinocytes. The basal level of MDC production is 118.0 \u00b1 8.3 pg/ mL, and 278.6 \u00b1 6.0 pg/mL of MDC was produced by IFN-\u03b3 treatment (10 ng/mL). Interestingly, eckol failed to inhibit the cytokine-stimulated production of MDC (Fig. 2B). However, dieckol significantly suppressed the production of MDC by IFN-\u03b3 in a concentration-dependent manner. Especially, 12.5 uM dieckol strongly suppressed by 135 \u00b1 12.7 pg/mL (almost the basal level) of MDC production in IFN-\u03b3-stimulated HaCaT keratinocyte (Fig. 2D).",

(A) HaCaT cells (5.0\u00d710 5 cells/mL) were pretreated with epigallocatechingallate (EGCG; 10 mM) or dieckol (2.5, 5, 10 mM) for 30 min. The phosphorylation of STAT1 was determined in cells stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 (10 ng/mL) for 15 min. The phosphorylation or level of each protein in whole cell lysates was determined by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (B) HaCaT cells were pre-treated with EGCG (10 mM) or dieckol (2.5, 5, 10 mM) for 2 h. The nuclear translocation of the STAT1 protein was determined in cells stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 for 20 min. Immunofluorescence staining for STAT1 was performed by using a primary antibody against STAT1, followed by a DyLight488-conjugated secondary antibody. The fluorescence was then identified by using a confocal microscope (FV500, Olympus Corp.), and the images were acquired at constant two-photon excitation microscopy (PMT), gain, offset, magnification (40\u00d7 oil immersion objective with a zoom factor of 1.5), and resolution. associated MAPKs depending on the cell type (Pearson et al., 2001;Madonna et al., 2008). We thus investigated the involvement of these signaling kinases in IFN-\u03b3 induced MDC production in HaCaT cells. We first determined time dependent activation of three MAPKs (ERK, JNK, p38) after IFN-\u03b3 treatment. As illustrated in Fig. 4A. IFN-\u03b3 induced the phosphorylation of ERK at 5 min, while there was no effect on the phosphorylation of JNK and p38. Then we examined the inhibitory effect of dieckol on the ERK activation in IFN-\u03b3-stimulated HaCaT cells. PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor, 10 mM), strongly suppressed ERK phosphorylation, but, dieckol did not inhibit ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). To confirm whether MAPKs pathway associate with MDC production, we determined the MDC level after the treatment of known MAPKs inhibitors in IFN\u03b3-stimulated HaCaT cells. SP600125 (a specific JNK inhibitor) and PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor), and SB203580 (a specific p38 inhibitor) did not affect on the MDC production induced by IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4C).

IFN-\u03b3 acts via two IFN receptors subunits (IFNGR1 and IFNGR2), which form a heterotetramer on the cell surface, and activates various signaling cascades. Phosphorylated STAT1 functions as a transcription factor that activates the primary genes related to inflammatory responses. Therefore, the STAT1 protein is a crucial and specific regulator of IFN-\u03b3 signaling that controls the transcription of target genes, including MDC (Ivashkiv and Hu. 2004;Best et al., 2005). It has been found that STAT1 phosphorylation plays a critical role in IFN-mediated innate immunity to microbial infection (van den Broek et al., 1995;Han et al., 2002;Semper et al., 2014). After phosphorylation, STAT1 homodimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, and promotes gene transcription via binding to IFN-\u03b3-activated genes. STAT1 homodimerization is preferentially mediated by the binding of the phosphory- Fig. 4. Effect of dieckol on the MAPKs pathway in IFN-\u03b3 -stimulated HaCaT human keratinocytes.

            "text": "The MAPK pathway is reportedly involved in the production of inflammatory chemokines. Several plant extracts and compounds have been shown to inhibit the actions of inflammatory chemokines via the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. (Pearson et al., 2001;Madonna et al., 2008;Chae et al., 2013;Yoon et al., 2013). To determine whether the MAPKs (ERK, JNK, p38) signaling is involved in IFN-\u03b3 induced MDC production in HaCaT cells, we first examined time dependent activation of three MAPKs (ERK, JNK, p38) after IFN-\u03b3 treatment. IFN-\u03b3 induced the phosphorylation of ERK at 5 min, while did not affect on the phosphorylation of JNK and P-38. Then, we focused on the inhibitory effect of dieckol on the ERK activation in IFN-\u03b3-stimulated HaCaT cells, but, the effect of dieckol was not significant. To confirm whether MAPKs pathway associate with MDC production, we determined the MDC levels after the treatment of known MAPKs inhibitors in IFN-\u03b3-stimulated HaCaT cells. SP600125 (a specific JNK inhibitor) and PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor), and SB203580 (a specific p38 inhibitor) did not affect on the MDC production induced by IFN-\u03b3. These results suggest that MAPKs pathway does not contribute significantly on the production of MDC in IFN-\u03b3 stimulated HaCaT cells.",

Dieckol also inhibited the activation of STAT1, a major transcription factor that activates the primary genes induced by IFN-\u03b3. In addition, MAPKs pathway did not affect on the production of MDC in IFN-\u03b3 stimulated HaCaT cells. These results provide new evidence regarding anti-inflammatory potential of dieckol and its action mechanism in a skin cell line."
