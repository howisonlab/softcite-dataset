Methods: Hepatic progenitor-like cells were isolated and cultured from the livers of patients who had undergone partial hepatectomy for various pathologies but displayed no sign of hepatic dysfunction. These cells were characterized by transcriptomic profiling, quantitative real-time PCR and immunocyto/histochemistry. Results: Cultured HPCs contained polygonal, high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and exhibited a global gene expression profile similar (67.8%) to that of primary hepatocytes. Among the genes with more than 20-fold higher expression in HPCs were a progenitor marker (CD90), a pentraxin-related gene (PTX3), collagen proteins (COL5A2, COL1A1 and COL4A2), cytokines (EGF and PDGFD), metabolic enzymes (CYBRD1, BCAT1, TIMP2 and PAM), a secreted protein (SPARC) and an endothelial protein C receptor (PROCR). Moreover, eight markers (ALB, AFP, CK8, CK18, CK19, CD90, CD117 and Oval-6) previously described as HPC markers were validated by qRT-PCR and/or immunocyto/histochemistry. Interestingly, human HPCs were also positive for the hematopoietic cell markers CD45 and CD109. Finally, we characterized the localization of HPCs in the canals of Hering and periportal areas with six previously described markers (Oval-6, CK8, CK18, CK19, CD90 and CD117) and two potential markers (CD45 and CD109). Conclusion: The human HPCs are highly similar to primary hepatocytes in their transcriptional profiles. The CD45 and CD109 markers could potentially be utilized to identify and isolate HPCs for further cytotherapy of liver diseases."

However, this capacity is limited after extensive or chronic injury and/or when hepatocyte repopulation is impaired (1). Moreover, the cell types that participate in liver regeneration remain uncertain, although mature hepatocytes and stem cells might both be involved (15,16). Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs), the human counterpart to rodent oval cells, exist in portal or periportal areas and contribute to liver regeneration (17,18). These cells emerge into the parenchyma, generally in the form of neoductules, and differentiate into mature hepatocytes and cholangiocytes to restore the damaged liver. However, the precise origin of these bipotent progenitors is still unclear (17,19,20). Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) can repopulate an injured liver, differentiate into mature hepatocytes in vitro, and participate in liver regeneration (8,16,21). BMSC transplantation has been used to improve a mouse model of tyrosinemia (9,22) and an inborn defect in a hepatocytic enzyme (1,4,5) by reconstituting the architecture and function of the injured liver. Our previous studies have demonstrated that acute hepatic failure-derived rat BMSCs have a hepatic transcriptional profile, expressing many of the same genes expressed by hepatocytes (23,24). These studies indicate that BMSCs are a potential source of HPCs for hepatocyte regeneration. Species-specific gene expression has been characterized in human and animal HPCs (9,17). In rodents (25)(26)(27)(28)(29), oval cells express markers of both hepatocyte and cholangiocyte lineages (such as albumin [ALB], cytokeratin 18 [CK18] and CK19) in addition to markers of both hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells (CD34, CD45 and CD90). In humans, HPCs with morphological features and immunohistological markers similar to those of oval cells have been characterized in normal liver and patients with chronic liver injury or submassive hepatic necrosis (30)(31)(32)(33)(34)(35)(36). Furthermore, these bipotent progenitor cells with characteristics similar to HPCs exist not only in human adult liver but also in human fetal liver (37,38).",

Informed consent was obtained from the patients and/or their relatives before the procedure. All experimental protocols in this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. The method of primary hepatocyte isolation was previously described (39). Briefly, the liver specimens (10 to 20 g) were perfused with four different buffer solutions supplemented with EDTA, 0.5% dispase, 0.05% collagenase type IV and DNase I. The freshly isolated whole liver cell suspensions were centrifuged at 50 \u00d7 g for 1 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM and centrifuged at 50 \u00d7 g for 1 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant and pellet were harvested separately. The pelleted hepatocytes were resuspended in PBS and centrifuged twice at 50 \u00d7 g for 1 min at 4 \u00b0C. The purified hepatocytes were harvested, and total RNA was extracted to perform global gene expression profiling by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. The supernatant portion containing the HPCs was centrifuged at 150 \u00d7 g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM and centrifuged at 150 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.

The harvested cells were cultured in a 10-mm plastic Petri dish in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. The cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator in a mixture of 95% air and 5% CO 2 . The medium was changed twice a week. After three or four days of culture, some contaminated hepatic cells showed a spindly shape including endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells and kupffer cells were scratched out from the petri dish by cell scraper. The cells with a round or oval shape were remained to proliferate for further culture. After one week of culture, the culture medium containing FBS was replaced with hepatocyte serum-free medium. The fresh medium was changed twice a week. To harvest enough HPCs for further transcriptional profiling analysis, the cells were cultured for three weeks.",

Liver segments (1 to 2 g) were fixed with formalin and embedded in paraffin before sectioning. The sections (5-\u03bcm thick) were applied to poly-L-lysine-coated slides. Following an inactivation of endogenous peroxidases with 3% H 2 O 2 for 10 min at RT, the sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies (Table 4). Control experiments included omission of the primary antibodies and substitution of the primary antibodies with nonimmune rabbit or mouse IgG. Subsequently, the sections were washed with PBS three times and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. After the reaction with DAB Chromogen, the sections were rinsed with distilled water, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted with Histomount solution (Invitrogen), and the labeled cells were visualized with an inverted microscope (Nikon, Eclipse E200, Tokyo, Japan), and digital images were captured using Nis-elements F 3.0 software. Omission of the primary antibody or substitution with an unrelated IgG served as a negative control.",

These cells possessed bipotential differentiation characteristics formed colonies after 3 days and presented polygonal, densely packed cytoplasm after 10 days in culture. Global gene expression analysis of these cells revealed a high similarity (67.8%) to primary hepatocytes. Compared with primary hepatocytes, 21 genes up-regulated more than 20-fold in HPCs were detected, including the progenitor marker CD90, four genes related to hepatocyte metabolism (CYBRD1, BCAT1, TIMP2 and PAM) and two cytokine genes (EGF, PDGFD). The HPC-enriched genes detected by microarray analysis were validated by qRT-PCR, with consistent results. Further analysis showed that most previously reported marker genes for HPCs (ALB, AFP, CK8, CK18, CK19, CD90, CD117 and Oval-6) were positive in our cultured HPCs. Moreover, two hematopoietic cell markers CD45 and CD109 were detected in HPCs. Five cell-surface markers and three mature hepatocyte-specific genes were not detected in HPCs by microarray or qRT-PCR analysis. The potential markers mentioned above were also confirmed at the protein level by immunocyto/immunohistochemistry, with consistent results. Although the morphology of the cells expressing Oval-6 and CD90 (Fig 6A and F) in human livers seems different from that of the cells expressing CD45 and CD109 (Fig 6E and G). It is possible that these cells were at the different stages of growth and development.",
