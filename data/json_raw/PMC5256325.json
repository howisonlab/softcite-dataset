Methods A total of 51 patients who had LBP with radiating pain were recruited between January 2011 and December 2012. The patient data were classified into the two groups 'favorable group' and 'non-favorable group' after 2 weeks of follow-up results. The favorable group was defined as those with a 50%, or more, reduction of pain severity according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) for back or leg pain. The clinical and radiological data were collected for univariate and multivariate analyses to determine the predictors of the effectiveness of TFESIs between the two groups. Results According to the back or the leg favorable-VAS group, the univariate analysis revealed that the corticosteroid approach for the enhanced nerve root, the proportion of the proximal flow, and the contrast dispersion of epidurography are respectively statistically significant relative to the other factors. Lastly, the multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between the corticosteroid approach and the enhanced nerve root in the favorable VAS group. Conclusion Among the variables, MRI showed that the corticosteroid approach for the enhanced target root is the most important prognostic factor in the predicting of the clinical parameters of the favorable TFESIs group.",

In some patients, the pain associated with an initial acute episode does not resolve and persists for more than 3 months, leading to the development of chronic LBP [4]. Most chronic LBP patients do not respond to medication or physical therapy, with complaints of continuous LBP, and it is eventually the cause of muscle weakness in the low back area that is secondary to a lack of exercise.",

            "text": "The authors assessed the radiological features including MRI to arrange the level of the herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), the type of HNP, the grade of the foraminal stenosis, the location of the herniated intervertebral disc, the existence of the contrast-enhanced nerve root, and the block level of the nerve root. The 1.5T MRI was used, and it included sagittal and axial T1-and T2weighted gadolinium-enhanced images. The types of HNP were categorized as bulging, protrusion, extrusion, and sequestration [10]. There are four grades according to Wildermuth's MRI grading system for the lumbar spine foraminal stenosis, as follows: (1) grade 0 (normal), normal dorsolateral border of the intervertebral disc and normal form at the foraminal epidural fat; (2) grade 1 (slight foraminal stenosis), deformity of the epidural fat, www.e-arm.org with the remaining fat still completely surrounding the exiting nerve; (3) grade 2 (marked foraminal stenosis), epidural fat only partially surrounding the nerve root; and (4) grade 3 (advanced foraminal stenosis), obliteration of the epidural fat [11][12][13]. An enhancement of a nerve root in the MRI was firstly evaluated by one of the authors, who was a physician trained in musculoskeletal pain and intervention, from an analysis of the pre-and post-contrast images stored at the same level settings. And then, the nerve root and the epidural enhancement were investigated by comparing the same nerve root of the pre-contrast images with the unaffected side or the newly detected root or epidural enhancement in the postcontrast images, which was differentiated from the opposite nerve root of the same level (Figs. 1, 2). This is similar to the method of the previously described literature [14]. According to the patient's clinical presentation with the MRI studies, the authors decided the suitable injection level. When the patient had multilevel HNP, the authors determined the single target root level depending on the severity. According to the presence of the nerve root enhancement in the MRI, two groups were formed as follows: enhancement and non-enhancement. The authors injected an enhanced nerve root level in the enhance- www.e-arm.org ment group. In the case of the non-enhancement group, the patients were given an injection according to the severity of their symptoms and the imaging correlation. In addition to the MRI findings, the fluoroscopic findings such as the contrast dispersion of the epidurography was defined in the previous study [15,16], the proportion of the proximal-flow pattern, the number of the flow level distribution, and the drug for the enhanced nerve root found in the MRI were also evaluated. The contrast distribution of the epidurographic findings were categorized into three distinct types, as defined by Pfirrmann et al. [16], as follows: intraepineural, extraepineural, and paraneural patterns (Fig. 3). These three contrast patterns are as follows: (1) the intraepineural pattern appears to be a tubular outline of the nerve root or within the nerve root sheath, (2) the extraepineural pattern was defined as a contrast filling around the nerve root sheath that was like a tubular filling defect, and (3) the paraneural pattern is explained by a cloudlike appearance, which is located beneath the pedicle in the lateral neural foramen and was not delineated by the contrast. The contrast flow patterns were evaluated among the groups according to whether the extent of the proximal was greater than 75%, 75% to 25%, or less than 25%, based on the final needletip position in the anterior-posterior fluoroscopic view; that is, the authors evaluated the fluoroscopic images for the spreading of the injectate to either the superior and/ or inferior level after the needle was placed. Before the corticosteroid was administered to the target, the contrast material was injected for the epidural flow pattern. In this article, a volume of 0.5 mL was first injected, and an additional 0.5 mL contrast was injected as a second injection for the checking of the number of the distributed levels. It was confirmed whether the reach of the injected contrast material is more proximal to the target nerve root under fluoroscopy when the patients had the enhanced nerve root lesion in the contrast-enhanced MRI.

Because of the minimal therapeutic effect of the TFESIs, the pain intensity was evaluated 2 weeks after the injection [16]. The collected patient data were classified into two groups according to the VAS change before and at 2 weeks after the intervention. According to the back-or leg-pain severity change from the VAS, the patients were divided into the 'favorable-VAS back or leg TFESIs group' and the 'non-favorable-VAS back or leg TFESIs group,' respectively. The favorable TFESIs group represents a VAS decline of at least 50% at 2 weeks after the intervention.",

So, the nature of the TFESIs, which is a procedure for the distribution of a corticosteroid to the area of the target nerve root, enables the formulation of an explanation regarding the reduced radiating pain of the patients [23]. Also, for the effective TFESIs, an identification of the precise target nerve with the use of the contrast material and the injecting of the corticosteroid into the superior portion could be helpful [16]. This finding is in accordance with the univariate analysis results of this study, but the enhanced spine MRI was also reviewed to find the precise target nerve root that was causing the radicular pain. The findings of Tak et al. [24] resemble the results of this study, in that they found improvements of the NRS and the ODI in the nerve root enhancement groups from the contrast-enhanced MRI; however, they did not evaluate the effectiveness at the L5-S1 HNP level and other factors such as the clinical or the radiological factors that are included in this study.",

The association between the contrast distributed pattern and a clinical improvement after TFESIs is the focus of a number of studies [15,16,25], and one study showed results that are similar to those of this study. Lee et al. [25] revealed that the extraepineural injection may be a factor in the achievement of improved results for the radicular symptom after TFESIs. They hypothesized that an extraepineural injection was a more successful outcome because the corticosteroid was delivered adjacent to the inflammatory epineurium of the nerve root. In contrast, Paidin et al. [15] revealed that the intraepineural and paraneural patterns were beneficial for the relieving of pain. Also, Pfirrmann et al. [16] reported no significant differences according to the contrast pattern, but they suggested that the intraepineural type would be a more effective response compared with the others. But, the intraepineural pattern should be avoided because it may cause more pain to the patients during the intervention [26]. Although they anticipated that the paraneural and extraepineural patterns would produce a similar result if the drug enters into the epidural space, the extraepineural pattern did not show a significant pain reduction. The results of these two studies are in contrast to the results of the present study, as this study revealed that the extraepineural pattern was significantly different from the others. Although both the extraepineural and paraneural patterns enable the entrance of the drug into the epidural space, the extraepineural pattern more precisely encircles the sheath of the target nerve root according to the classification of Pfirrmann et al. [16]. It is therefore possible to infer that the extraepineural pattern is more effective than the paraneural pattern because the injected material can be more adjacent to the nerve in accordance with the overall results of the present study. In this study, the authors not only evaluated the contrast dispersion pattern, but other prognostic factors such as the proximal flow pattern under fluoroscopy and specific inflamed neural structures under an enhanced MRI were also examined.",

[9] evaluated the prognostic parameters of TFESIs according to the location of the HNP and the degree of the nerve root compression. They concluded that the centrally or extraforaminally herniated discs and the low-grade nerve root compression were different between the responder and nonresponder groups. Another study investigated the clinical and radiological factors like the present research [8]. In their study, only the presence of the HNP, central stenosis, foraminal stenosis and spondylolisthesis was checked for in the radiological findings; among these, there were no significant predictive factors. Instead, they found meaningful clinical predictive factors including higher baseline scores for tools such as the VAS and the McGill Pain Inventory, a positive femoral stretch test, and a reduction of the worsening of the pain during walking. By inferring from an incorporation of the previous findings with those of the present study, the best way to achieve favorable TFESIs could be a precise administration of a corticosteroid to the target nerve root that is found in an enhanced spine MRI.",

Third, a relatively short-term follow-up period was the other limitation of this study. The follow-up period of the 2 weeks after the intervention was selected to achieve a corticosteroid effect according to the previously described articles [16,34]. The follow-up was so brief that the mid-or long-term therapeutic effects could not be evaluated sufficiently.",
