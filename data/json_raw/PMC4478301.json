            "text": "Background: We have previously shown that recurrent arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) in children with cerebral arteriopathy is associated with increased circulating endothelial cells and endothelial microparticles, consistent with ongoing endothelial injury. To date, however, little is known about endothelial repair responses in childhood AIS. We examined the relationship between the number and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and AIS recurrence. Methods: Flow cytometry was used to identify peripheral blood mononuclear cells positive for CD34/kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR). In a subgroup of patients (5 in each group selected at random), monocytic EPC function was assessed by colony-forming unit (EPC-CFU) capacity and incorporation into endothelial cell networks in Matrigel. BDNF was measured using ELISA. Results: Thirty-five children, aged 12 years (range: 5-16.5; 9 males), with AIS and cerebral arteriopathy were studied; 10 had recurrent AIS. CD34+/KDR+ cells were significantly higher in recurrent AIS compared to non-recurrent AIS patients (p = 0.005) and controls (p = 0.0002). EPC-CFU and EPC incorporation into endothelial cell networks were significantly reduced in recurrent compared to non-recurrent AIS patients (p = 0.04 and p = 0.01, respectively). Levels of BDNF were significantly higher in recurrent compared to non-recurrent AIS patients (p = 0.0008) and controls (p = 0.0002). Conclusions: Children with recurrent AIS and cerebral arteriopathy had increased circulating CD34+/KDR+ cells and BDNF consistent with an endothelial repair response. However, EPC function was impaired. Future studies are needed to examine whether suboptimal endothelial repair contributes to childhood AIS recurrence.",

            "text": "Abnormalities or arteriopathies of the cervical or intracranial circulation are implicated in the aetiology and recurrence of childhood arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) [1] . We have previously shown that in children with AIS associated with arteriopathy, indices of endothelial injury (circulating endothelial cells and endothelial microparticles) are higher in those with a recurrent compared with a monophasic disease course suggesting that persistent endothelial injury could contribute to recurrent AIS [2] . Similar to other vascular disorders, it is likely that a series of endothelial repair responses are mobilized in response to this ongoing vascular injury to re-establish endothelial integrity [3] . For instance, circulating CD34+/kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)+ cells are considered to play a key role as endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) in vascular maintenance and repair, and a reduced number has been proposed to result in endothelial dysfunction [4] . Monocyte-derived EPC are likely to have an additional role since a reduced function of these cells negatively influences their restorative capacities [3,4] . Notably, previous studies have suggested that EPC release brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and they have implicated this in neuronal protection and neurogenesis following ischaemic stroke [5] .",

The study had Institutional Ethics Committee approval. Informed consent/assent was obtained from the study participants/parents. Cerebral/cervical arteriopathy was defined as focal or segmental stenosis or occlusion, with regular or irregular abnormalities of the arterial wall and categorized according to published consensus definitions [6,7] . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) were performed on a 1.5-tesla magnetic resonance scanner using a standard imaging protocol, including T2-weighted turbo spin-echo imaging in the axial plane, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence in the coronal plane, T1-weighted spin-echo imaging in the sagittal plane, and three-dimensional short-echo time-of-flight MRA of the circle of Willis. In the <2-year age group, the axial T2-weighted imaging was replaced by a double-echo short tau inversion recovery imaging sequence, and the coronal FLAIR sequence was not acquired. Catheter cerebral arteriography was performed at the clinician's discretion. Blood was taken prior to cerebral arteriography to avoid catheter-induced endothelial injury. All children underwent standardized investigations for AIS risk factors (online suppl. material; for all online material, see www. karger.com/doi/10.1159/000381963). The patients were categorized into 2 groups according to AIS recurrence (>1 week after the initial clinical event). We recruited 25 healthy controls aged 11.5 years (range: 2-16; 7 males) undergoing minor surgical procedures (preoperative blood samples obtained) with no identifiable chronic illnesses. ",

In conditions of acute vascular ischaemia, an increase in the number of circulating CD34+/KDR+ cells has been observed in association with a concomitant increase in levels of EPC-mobilizing factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal cell-derived factor-1, suggesting a direct causal relationship [4] . In addition, recent studies proposed that CD34+/KDR+ cells are generated from CD34+ cells at plateletrich sites of vascular injury, thus reflecting the plasticity of CD34+ cells and their capacity to respond to and be taken up into ischaemic lesional tissue [9,10] . These responses to ischaemic insult may still be relevant to patients with recurrent AIS sometime after the initial insult, as we have detected ongoing endothelial injury many months after an acute clinical event [1] .",

The same may also be true of children with recurrent AIS. As BDNF mobilizes haematopoietic progenitor cells and promotes revascularization in ischaemic injury [5,12] , the increased levels we noted may represent a continuous effort to support endothelial repair and neuronal survival in children with recurrent AIS. It is uncertain which factors might result in the decreased circulatory EPC angiogenic function we observed. Possibilities include: increased uptake from the circulation of the most angiogenic active EPC into areas of cerebral ischaemia, inherently impaired angiogenic potential in children prone to AIS recurrence, or another as yet undefined neuro-immunological pathway secondary to brain injury adversely influencing angiogenic responses. Larger longitudinal studies of CD34+/KDR+ cells and EPC function over time and in response to therapy (aspirin, anticoagulation and/or immunosuppression) are now urgently needed.",

In addition, although treatments were within recommended clinical guidelines, there remained some therapeutic heterogeneity. The timing of sampling from the index AIS was not standardized in our study. We did, however, perform binary logistic regression analysis after correction for this potentially important confounder and found that higher numbers of circulating CD34+/KDR+ cells were still significantly related to AIS recurrence. The effect of immunosuppression on endothelial repair responses was not formally assessed in our study; future longitudinal studies of EPC changes with time after the initial cerebrovascular event and in response to therapy would be of considerable interest in paediatric AIS and could enhance our understanding of the effect of immunosuppression on EPC biology. We were underpowered to perform formal subgroup analyses of the various arteriopathies studied herein; larger multicentre prospective studies to establish the specificity of these vascular repair responses across different vascular pathologies leading to AIS are now warranted.",
