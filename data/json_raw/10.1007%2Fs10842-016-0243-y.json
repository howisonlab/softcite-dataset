Industrial policy in highly regulated industries such as wireless telecommunications is able to support evolution of established technologies and adjust itself to sustaining innovations, while regulatory disconnection impedes disruptive technologies, and the market plays a quite secondary role in this process. We observe more innovations in those parts of telecommunications where regulator is less active, but the core, the physical layer, of the industry is changing in sustaining way of development of the technology. The paper argues that the problem of impediment to disruptive innovations could be alleviated if the crucial resources of the industry were accessible for a number of potential innovators and newcomers. The openness makes easier the appearance of disruptive technologies, and regulation must facilitate it in order to promote opportunities for creative destruction.",

The best incentives for innovation activity is the Bthe difference in profit that a firm can earn \u2026 compared to what it would earn^otherwise (Gilbert 2006). Opportunity to escape competition and gain a monopoly and, thus, to charge prices higher than the competitive level is one of the main driving forces of innovations. 1 Therefore, the conduct of a company that innovates is anticompetitive by its nature, but it does not mean that such behaviour is undesirable from the point of view of social interests and, thus, is not considered in such a way by antitrust policy. 2 What is really desirable is that competitors of the innovator also have opportunities to innovate and positively affect the innovative conduct of the leader. However, at this particular point the triviality of the problem disappears and we enter the field of different legal and economics concepts, tools and methods of dealing with issues related to allocation of exclusive privileges and antitrust investigations.",

However, we can hypothesise that the market per se could be sufficient to the promotion of incentives for innovators 3 and, at the same time, could, possibly, make obsolete any needs to antitrust interventions. Therefore, it is quite risky to make conclusions that reasons for the victory of the leaders are their best business practices without paying attention to the fact that regulation played certain role in this superiority.",

They can be trying to assess the potential harm to consumers after a merger of some significant market players, but it is difficult to take into consideration that the structure of this market had been already transformed to the oligopolistic form by the regulatory policy and the real market forces have not already played a noticeable role in the field. Dogan and Lemley (2008) notice these shortcomings of antitrust law when they point out that Bthreats to competition do not come only from private conduct in unregulated industries, \u2026 [but] also come from government regulation itself. \u2026 Where it is the state itself that decides upon an anticompetitive end, the antitrust laws have not intervened.M eanwhile, the problem becomes more complicated when the task of antitrust investigation is not only to develop the theory of harm to consumers, but to understand how the opportunities of market participants for innovations might be harmed. 4 However, it should be noticed that innovations very often come to our life in completely unpredictable ways, and, thus, it might be merely impossible to assess the potential harm for innovations if even the source of such unpredictable innovations is uncertain. What is more important is that the real threat for innovations comes not only from the conduct of leaders, but from the legal frameworks that determine such conduct and protect positions of incumbents.",

Disruptive innovation is one of those forces that can yield the real threats to established firms and Bgenerates the kind of 'creative destruction' described by Schumpeter^(De Streel and Larouche 2015). Shelanski (2013) points out that due to the importance of creative destruction, the Schumpeterian approach, despite its arguments about the negative relation between competition and innovations, does not exclude antitrust interventions in the regulatory policy. 5 Meanwhile, for established firms the best way to protect their positions is to capture the control over innovations, and here both kinds of innovations, sustaining and disruptive, are equally important to be controlled. In highly regulated industries, such as telecommunications, the Banticompetitive end^might be the result of regulatory activity, and the opportunities for disruptive innovations might be harmed by regulation.",

Lawrence Lessig (2001) uses the similar idea when he talks about the control over the physical layer of a communications system. The problem is that the most of them by their economic nature are classic examples of private goods, since they are both rivalrous and excludable. Possibly, we could base some hypothesis on the enormous potential of the capacity of fiber-optic infrastructure, but since the access to this infrastructure has physical barriers, its exploitation in the way of an uncontrolled Bphysical layer^seems difficult. At the same time, the radio spectrum by its nature is Bcommon good^, and it is quite possible that technological solutions might alleviate the problem of the rivalry of this good, and, thereby, transform it into the economic realm of Bpublic goods^. Another crucial resource of telecommunications, that is also by its nature is non-rivalrous and non-excludable, is information and knowledge that are controlled by the incumbents through the institution of intellectual property. It is possible to assume that the mechanisms of control over these resources maintain the oligopolistic structure of the field and facilitate the development of the mainstream part of the industry.",

In the beginning of the paper, I provide a brief analysis of disruptive innovations in telecommunications and distinguish WiMAX as a real life example of disruptive technology in the industry, explain this position and describe the economic model of the technology. Then I use this case to demonstrate that the failure of this disruption was determined by state interventions in market mechanisms that, eventually, did not allow to put into practice the economic model, and protected the established status quo of the area. In the final section I argue that the current paradigm, that justifies regulatory interventions, heavily depends on the previous way of interaction of regulation and technology, and it locks the evolution of the industry on the mainstream technology, protecting business interests of incumbents.",

The initial version of the concept claimed that in the first phase an innovation performs worse than the main product or services in the market but with lower prices, and only in the second phase, the quality of the innovation increases and attracts the mainstream consumers.

Secondly, the entire project cost a lot for the participants and, possibly, might be considered as one of the most costly undertakings that has ever existed in telecommunications and has not achieved success. Only Intel alone invested a huge amount in this idea, and that money was spent not only on R&D or production of WiMAX chipsets, but also on the deployment of wireless networks 7 and even acquisition of radio frequencies (PCWorld, May 8, 2008).

The digital technologies of the XXI century provided opportunities for such disruptiveness and left entire markets in the annals of history. Examples are markets of tape recorders and cassette tapes, analog photo cameras and photographic films, cable radio, matrix printers, cathode ray tube technology, etc. Meanwhile, not only the digital world threatened positions of companies that achieved their success in the XX centurythe development of digital technologies also threatened the status quo of the digital marketplace. Grove (1996) pointed out that Intel, whose main business was production of dynamic memory chips and who was one of the leaders of this market, in the middle of the 1980s had a real risk to lose everything and only the decision to change the business and to move the focus on manufacturing microprocessors allowed the company to protect its positions and to reach worldwide leadership in the growing market of personal computers.",

WiMAX did not assume the evolution of the networks of mobile providers, but instead required new investments in the creation of new networks that would operate separately from the cellular networks. Of course, some core parts of the networks infrastructure might be used for different kinds of networks, but, nevertheless, the adoption of WiMAX for mobile carriers could signify excessive investments in the equipment without returns from the previous undertakings (Weil 2009, 9). In other words, sunk costs associated with their current way of development made adoption of the non-mainstream innovation highly unattractive to their business models. From this point of view this technology perfectly fits one of the important features of disruptive innovations that was noticed by Christiansen and was highlighted in the beginning of this paper, namely, the financial unattractiveness for incumbents. However, it does not entirely mean that mobile service providers would never develop WiMAX networks. In order to preserve their positions and to broaden the spectrum of services they could not entirely reject WiMAX technology, but they were reluctant in their response to the emergence of this innovation and it was, definitely, not the best way of the development of the industry for their business models. 12 The technology was not only unattractive for the established mobile operators, but also for the incumbents of the traditional wired telecommunications industry. Many of them already had assets in the mobile business and, thus, there were no reasons to create competition with other units within their companies. Reasons for the adoption of fixed WiMAX solutions were even weaker than the possible embracement of the mobile version of the technology: the implementation of fixed WiMAX for remote areas might be less attractive business than the monopolistic development of wired infrastructure through the government subsidisation of the universal service, while creation of such networks in parallel with their existing networks simply made no sense.",

At the same time, the European approach that aimed to the promotion of service-based competition was not the best solution for infrastructure development and some recent researches point out these shortcomings of European regulation (Yoo 2014). 14 Finally, maybe the most important issue that had to be solved for the attraction of investors and entrepreneurs is the creation of expectations that this technology will change the world of telecommunications. Investments in the creation of WiMAX networks for the provision of services in underserved areas could be a question for new adepts of the technology, but if to consider the outdoor solutions for the coverage of these areas as just a first stage in the formation of the future mobile business, then this activity is merely a necessary part of the whole business model where the desired pay-off will be achieved later.",

Butenko and Larouche (2015), for example, argue that Bregulation affects which inventions are made, which are developed, and which are not, as well as which take off, and which do not^. The interaction of technological change and regulation defines the actions of industry players and shape the architecture of the network and characteristics of the key technologies, and telecommunications provide us good examples of how Ball changes in regulation produce important consequences on the organization of the industry that in turn \u2026 have important consequences on the technology^ (Antonelli 1995). What is more interesting here and what might be referred from the case of the WiMAX story is that in the current regulatory regime the market plays a quite secondary role in this process. The victory in the battle between the evolution of the mainstream technology and the disruptive technology proposed to the market from the outside was not determined by the superiority of technological solutions or even more sustainable business models of the established players, but was a consequence of regulatory decisions and legal norms in some key aspects. Eventually, the economic model of WiMAX could not solve the problems highlighted in the previous section and there is a clear relationship between this failure and the government interventions into the market.",

On the contrary, the social utility from the economies of scale, and understanding of the best ways of its achievement incorporated in the economics mainstream, have always ruled the decision makings concerning the radio spectrum allocation, and instead of distribution of the radio spectrum for a number of entrepreneurs, it has always been allocated to small groups of big service providers. 17 There is also another area of government interventions, that is very relevant to the field of wireless technology, as well as to the industries of the new economy in general, and this area is the institution of intellectual property. As it was mentioned in the beginning of the paper there is no consensus about the scope of necessary interventions and even a necessity to create incentives through the provision of exclusive rights. This section of the paper analyses the impact of both of these aspects, the government intervention in the area of radio spectrum use and allocation of exclusive rights to objects of the intellectual sphere on the eventual defeat of the disruptive wireless technology by the mainstream part of the industry, and, at the same time, discusses the possible positive role of regulation in the promotion of technological pluralism in the industry.",

The problem is not only that the state allocates rights to use radio waves, but it also determines how the spectrum should be used, and this particular issue makes innovation dependent also on policymakers, but not only on creative minds. 18 The developers of the WiMAX standard from the very beginning had been struggling with the necessity to comply with spectrum regulation that was different in different places and, thus, availability of the parts of the spectrum for the future deployment of networks was also different. For example, the report of the OECD (2006) pointed that BMuch of the success of WiMAX hinges on the ability of operators to find appropriate and available spectrum^, and that Bwithout a globally recognized frequency band, the economies of scale will be reduced^. It was also clearly understood by the members of WiMAX Forum and was expressed in its official papers dedicated to the regulatory issues (WiMAX Forum 2004). 19 Furthermore, the developers, in order to mitigate the problem and to find some intersections in the regulation of spectrum in different countries, were trying to adjust technical features of the technology to these common points by reducing, for example, the required bandwidth for a channel or the transmission power. However, at the same time, it limited the capacity of the technology.",

The technological and logical continuation of 3G networks could be only LTE from these two alternatives, and it was clear for the senior executives of Qualcomm. Peter Lancia, Sr. Director in Marketing of Qualcomm, noticed that BLTE will provide a parallel evolution path to 3G, and will leverage 3G's scale and ecosystem of vendors, operators, consumers and application developers^(OnQ blog at the Qualcomm's website, May 25, 2010).",

By 2015, the major part of the market of mobile infrastructure equipment was already under the control of just four companies: Ericsson, Nokia, Alcatel-Lucent and Huawei, and nowadays, when Nokia finally gained control over Alcatel-Lucent, the oligopolistic structure has become even more prominent. The number of mobile service providers has also declined, and some European mobile markets have already changed their structure from four to three operators (Austria, Germany, Ireland, etc.).",

These crucial resources were under the control of incumbents, and for them the alternative development of the industry was not the best possible option, while new entrants, who could bring the disruption in the market, were in a dependent position from the conduct of the giants, and only industrial policy aimed at the promotion of technological pluralism and competition could alleviate the problem.",

Antonelli (1995) in his analysis of technological change in telecommunications points out that Bthe larger the variety of independent players, the larger the opportunities to generate new technologies^, and it has a particular sense for the recent story of the wireless industry. There were a number of sets of 2G standards, then there were just two 3G sets of standards, and there is the only one standard considered as 4G technology. However, if the technological pluralism was a target of the industrial policy, then we could expect not only to have the diversity, but also to observe the continuing process of creative destruction in this viable field of the new economy.",

In social sciences dedicated to regulatory issues this idea is expressed in the concept of mutual shaping of technology and society (e.g. MacKenzie and Wajcman 1999). Meanwhile, in a case of disruptive technology in highly regulated industries there could be an issue, because the law has been developing along with the mainstream of the industry and it has created the playground for the mainstream players, while for the technology that assumes an alternative way of the functioning of the field the old rules could be inappropriate or even hostile.",

Moreover, even when technology is already able to provide such solution, and nowadays we can hear claims that this time has already come (e.g. Werbach 2004;Staple and Werbach 2004), the regulation is very reluctant to change its paradigm. The new technological paradigm might signify not only dramatic alteration of regulatory approaches without clear understanding of the final results, but also may have a significant negative impact on the business interests of current major players, and, thus, this regulatory shift is not desirable neither for the incumbents nor for the policymakers. This is not only the case of radio spectrum or industrial policy of telecommunications in general. It is the pattern that can be found in many cases when a regulated industry faces disruptive innovations. Uber or Airbnb, for instance, have also experienced numerous obstructions from the side of regulation. 29 However, the attempts of policymakers to protect the established business interests is not necessarily a case of regulatory capture, but also their natural response to the threats to stability, since new technology might convey unpredictable consequences.",

Government establishes the same rules for all members of society to get protection on the results of creativity of human minds, and, theoretically, anyone can use these mechanisms for his business purposes. There is a restriction for the usage of a particular idea, but not the restriction for the use of alternatives. 30 At the same time, the allocation of radio frequencies a priori does not assume the pluralistic landscape of commercial wireless networks and allows to allocate these privileges only to a very limited number of actors. However, it is possible to argue that this difference in some cases is mostly theoretical. Inventions might be essential for the entire industry without possibilities to invent around, 31 and, thus, it could be an analogy between property rights on such resource and property rights on an essential part of the radio spectrum, merely because it might be an absence of alternatives in both cases. Since the technological inventions are not the result of individual genius but the natural consequence of technological development of our civilisation, 32 even patent races to some extent might be considered as an analogy of Braces^for radio frequencies, and, thus, both these institutions similarly promote the ongoing process of concentration of the field.",

From this point of view, the most important economic effect of IPR is on industry structure and it reflects the idea that regulation, affecting the industry structure, also affects the architecture of the network. Centralisation of decision making about the technological development inevitably affects the process of technological change and expresses in the architecture of the network that is, as Antonelli (1995) notices, Bstrongly influenced by the changing characteristics of clay technologies^.",

At the same time, they claim that the advantage of hierarchical systems is that they better cope with Type II errors, when it would be more reasonable to reject some accepted projects. Tim Wu (2006) emphasises that since decentralised systems (polyarchies) are able to approve more projects than hierarchies, Bthey manage to capture the few available profitable ideas^. Following the logic of this literature and taking into account that the technological variety of the wireless industry presented in the market is not so diverse, it is possible to argue that facilitation of decentralised decision makings in the industry would provide more chances for valuable ideas to materialise in the technological solutions.",

What is also interesting here, is that without regulatory participation in the solution of these issues even assured access to long term financial institutions, and in the WiMAX case we observe that Intel and others have invested a lot in the project, is not sufficient for the achieving success. Moreover, inability to get access to the industrial resources merely signifies that financial support of even a lucrative idea at an early stage of its development would be highly limited, and, again it plays as a discouraging factor for innovations in the field.",

There were studies that claimed that Betamax was a superior standard, but, nevertheless, lost the battle, and, thus, it is possible to assume that the choice of the market did not represent the best possible outcome (Liebowitz and Margolis 1995). However, here is the crucial difference of these two cases. In the Betamax-VHS case the market played the superior role in the adoption of the technology, while in the WiMAX-LTE case the role of the market was secondary and the outcome was mainly determined by regulation. Moreover, Sony, whose videotape format was defeated by JVC, was able to bring to the market the DVD format (in collaboration with Philips, Toshiba and Panasonic) and avoid the mistakes of the previous experience. The introduction of DVD was a clear disruption for VHS industry. The DVD format provided obvious advantages for participants of the home video market and, eventually, replaced VHS as a method of video distribution. On the one hand, these two examples show us, that the market does not exclude a risk to sort out superior technology and from this point of view it is impossible to argue that it solves the problem better than regulation, but, on the other hand, it leaves more chances for a technological shift at the later stages compared to the regulatory policy that creates opportunities for leaders to determine technological development. Moreover, even if the market outcome is not the best from short-term efficiency perspectives, industrial pluralism is able to be a basis for a future technological breakthrough.",

Regulation has locked-in the future development of the industry on the mainstream technology and eliminated alternatives. Meanwhile, the WiMAX story shows us that not only that concentration in telecommunications is not a necessary condition for the innovative development, but also that disruptive technologies are able to attract investments in this field from newcomers and weak players of the industry, putting the mainstream under the pressure of competition, and fostering innovations in their business. However, innovations require accessibility of the main resources and that might be achieved only if the resources are in the common domain. Even if WiMAX was not the technology that could benefit from this openness, it had chances to evolve to the version that could. The main advantage of the open access to the essential resources is that the openness makes easier the appearance of disruptive innovations, and regulation must facilitate this openness in order to promote the opportunities for creative destruction.",

Therefore, if regulation contributes to such centralised decision making and if the outcome of the decision making is affected by the presence of sunk costs, then this contribution shapes the entire way of technological change. Meanwhile, active participation of newcomers in innovation activity may facilitate the process of creative destruction and, thereby, result not only in positive economic effects, but also in alleviation of socio-economic problems (see., e.g., an analysis of the impact of this process on income inequalities in Antonelli and Agnieszka 2016).",

The same maximum power of radio transmitter was established for Wi-Fi (Decision of GRFC 28.11.05 \u2116 05-10-01-001), and compliance with such rule merely made the economy of such networks quite doubtful.
