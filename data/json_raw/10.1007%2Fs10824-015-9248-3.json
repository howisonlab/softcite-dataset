Our results suggest a significantly negative association between distance and the value of capital pledged to projects, which is consistent with the notion that the entrepreneur's network of close contacts might play a central role in funding. Furthermore, our results contradict the idea that crowdfunding reduces the inhibiting effect of donor-entrepreneur distance. In addition, the results show that a long project exposure is associated with higher values of pledges. These results suggest practical implications for the study of crowdfunding as a financing platform. This",

            "text": "Brazil is one of the major music producing and consuming regions worldwide, and it had the 11th largest market in 2009 (IFPI 2010). Although 58 % of the market was national and 90 % of the best-selling albums were by local musicians in 2009 (IFPI 2014), music production differs little from the world market, as a few record companies compose the local market (Cassiolato et al. 2008). As such, the cost of entry for budding musicians is high (Cameron 2015). Although there is often demand from Brazilian artists for financing their activities (Lucas 2000), access to resources for beginners is scarce. Indeed, if we consider musicians as entrepreneurs, at the outset of their initiatives they find it difficult to attract external capital. The problem of accessing specific financing sources is inherent to their initial stage (Berger and Udell 1998;Cosh et al. 2009). This difficulty places a limiting factor on the entrepreneur's chances of survival and growth, especially given the lack of true guarantees and what potential investors would view as sufficient cash flows or good reputation. It should also be noted that investors are faced with asymmetric information. According to Cosh et al. (2009), entrepreneurs requiring smaller amounts of capital are unable to access venture capital, private equity or banks, which may be available in other stages. Hence, these entrepreneurs tend to find backing from: (1) their own resources, (2) their family and (3) their circle of close friends (Parker 2009;Sheng and Mendes-da-Silva 2014).",

This method has enabled relatively small sums pledged by a large number of people to make businesses viable in a more flexible and less costly way that does not require intermediate financiers. A large number of platforms for raising funds through crowdfunding have appeared as a result of this phenomenon. One example is Kickstarter (https:// www.kickstarter.com/), which is currently the largest platform in the world. Kickstarter is a North American website hosting projects including films, games, music, design and technology. Since its launch in 2009, it has attracted more than R$ 1.5 billion from 5.1 million people to finance more than 50,000 creative projects (Qiu 2013).",

South America, for example, represented only 0.03 % of this market and that portion exceeded only the corresponding one for the African continent, which represented just 0.003 % (Massolution 2013). In addition to the social impact of crowdfunding and its interest from the financial media, and more recently, the academic business community (Shiller 2013;Mollick 2014;Bruton et al. 2015), various governments have recognized its relevance to developing countries (Royal and Windsor 2014), and consequently, they have given attention to regulating this activity (Agrawal et al. 2014). For example, the US Government recently approved legislation entitled the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), which has the main objective of stimulating access by companies in the emerging growth stage (Stemler 2013).",

Investors in startups also tend to prefer businesses that are physically closer, as they are motivated by the wish to reduce the information asymmetry (Lee et al. 2008). However, crowdfunding allows an unlimited number of geographically dispersed people to be reached for the purpose of obtaining small amounts of money for financing a project or enterprise. It also allows business activities to be monitored as they progress, and this monitoring can occur over large distances, which will reduce information asymmetries. Moreover, in their mode of pledges, creative entrepreneurs like musicians can overcome problems of market capitalism as a delivery mechanism (Cameron 2015).",

This crisis has been perceived as due to failings intrinsic to the financial system and the people running it. In particular, financial agents have been seen as one of the principal causes of the crisis for working excessively for their own benefit. According to Shiller (2013), the financial industry needs time to rebuild its reputation with society, and this process is characterized by the emergence of financial innovations, e.g., social impact bonds and crowdfunding. In this sense, crowdfunding is frequently identified as one of the most relevant modern financial innovations (Kuti and Madar\u00e1sz 2014). This financing method has emerged as a novel way of raising capital for entrepreneurial ventures (Macht 2014), and it frequently occurs through the internet. Crowdfunding has enabled different business types, such as agribusiness, social projects, technological innovation projects and particularly cultural production, without the pitfalls of traditional methods of financing (Braet et al. 2013;Lehner 2013;Schwartz 2013;Agrawal et al. 2014).

It is normally enabled through the internet by means of social media (Lehner 2013), and it allows entrepreneurs to reach geographically dispersed people around the globe who are willing to support the project (Saxton and Wang 2014). Crowdfunding has been described as the accumulation of small investments in individual projects by a large number of individuals who are supported by a platform (Royal and Windsor 2014). One of the characteristics of crowdfunding projects is the existence of a funding target. Often a campaign exceeds 100 % of its funding target, which is known as ''overfunding,'' entrepreneurs are not required to take investment but reserve the right to accept any amount beyond 100 %.

As in the specific case of this article, the people who are interested in music production projects are not necessarily interested in financial returns, as discussed by Kuti and Madar\u00e1sz (2014) and Royal and Windsor (2014). By means of these platforms, the entrepreneur can seek a small sum, e.g., a few thousand Brazilian reals or less, to fund a specific project that is motivated by their own dream or objective. Usually, these types of projects receive the majority of their funding from the entrepreneur's social network, i.e., his or her network of personal contacts (family and friends) (Agrawal et al. 2011;Sheng and Mendes-da-Silva 2014). These social networks provide additional support that such funding does not customarily receive from angel investors, such as advice, governance and prestige (Ferrary and Granovetter 2009). From this starting point, recent studies have highlighted these aspects as pertinent to a relevant research agenda on the theme of crowdfunding (Lehner 2013).",

There are essentially four models for how individuals provide their sponsorship to projects (Kuti and Madar\u00e1sz 2014;Royal and Windsor 2014). The first model is donation-our case in this research, which applies mainly to projects that are characterized as artistic, humanitarian and socioenvironmental. The sponsorship is in many cases virtually philanthropic. In other words, the investor does not expect a direct personal return from the donation. The second model is based on credit: The funds are provided to the entrepreneur as a loan with an expected return rate. This model does not (currently) exist in Brazil, as this activity is restricted to financial institutions by law. The third and most widespread crowdfunding model to date is based on nonfinancial compensation: Investors receive something in exchange for sponsoring the project. Individuals usually receive the product that was the objective of the appeal, such as books, CDs, DVDs, show tickets or a wide variety of other things. Finally, there is equity crowdfunding, in which the sponsors are effectively investors and receive a share in the equity of the company they finance. This practice is still rarely found in active use worldwide due to regulatory obstacles (Heminway and Hoffman 2011;Ahlers et al. 2012), and it represented just 5 % of the total volume of funds managed through crowdfunding platforms globally in 2013, according to Massolution (2013).",

Additionally, it became possible: (1) to monitor the whole process (with entrepreneurs having access at any time to all of the investors in the project), (2) to see the percentage of the fundraising target already achieved and (3) to see the remaining time the fundraising period had to run.",

The average investor-entrepreneur distance found by Agrawal et al. (2011) was approximately 4,828 km, which is greater than the distance between the most southern and northern parts of Brazil (about 4300 km).

However, in the musical production context, we must examine the mechanisms underlying the proximity of the donor and the amount donated. Crowdfunding in the music industry cannot be seen only as an intermediary agent, as it is also the locus where social connections between fans and musicians occur (Zheng et al. 2014;Colombo et al. 2015). These fans do not just invest in the project of a singer or a band: They are meeting the request of people who are part of their social network (Saxton and Wang 2014) or are feeling motivated to act prosocially (Ariely et al. 2009). For these reasons, we advocate that the mechanisms inherent in the social capital of musicians and the behavioral aspects of donors simultaneously affect the relationship between the geographic distance and the value of a pledge.",

In the crowdfunding context, these personal contacts, such as friends, intense fans and family, often tend to be closer to the authors of the projects (see McPhearson et al. 2001). Moreover, because the contacts are parts of the authors' real social networks, it is likely that these contacts are direct targets of funding campaigns. Indeed, using data from Sellaband, Agrawal et al. 2011found that not only did most of the donations occur in the same geographical area or in nearby areas, but these donations also had the highest value. Although they have not considered the distance of ties between donors and musicians, Mollick (2014) and Zheng et al. (2014) identified a positive relationship between the number of social contacts identified on Facebook or other social networks (e.g., Weibo Page, a Chinese social network) with the amount donated and with the musical project's performance. These results are also supported by Saxton and Wang (2014), who found that nonprofit organizations with more Facebook fans receive more donations, and by Colombo et al. (2015), who found that greater numbers of contacts on Linkedin were associated with both the number of supporters and the volume of capital raised in 669 projects on the Kickstarter platform.",

The donors can include even the most avid fans appealing for recognition by the musicians. 1 This behavior in the act of giving to musical projects in crowdfunding happens not only for personal reasons or for direct benefits (for example, received gifts), but also because donors want to obtain a good image or desire the respect and approval of the connected community that is raising money (Ariely et al. 2009). These networks of relations (as we have said) tend to be geographically close to the entrepreneurs. From these arguments, it is relevant to test hypothesis H 1 : H 1 There is a negative association between the geographic distance separating the entrepreneur and the donor and the value of the music crowdfunding investments.",

The reason is that with an increase in the number of donors, it is more likely that these donors will have links between themselves, which would make them more visible to each other (see Burt 2005). Indeed, the increased redundancy enables the network to operate as a coercive apparatus (Matzat 2004), as those who have not yet supported an endeavor feel increasingly obliged to contribute (Ariely et al. 2009). In addition, this sense of obligation, which grows with the project exposure, should affect not only the likelihood of contributing, but also the value of the donation. As Ariely et al. (2009) discussed, in the desire to be socially approved, donors feel morally obligated to contribute a proportional or greater value. It should be considered that this behavior is reinforced in social networks, as one of its key features is the reciprocity in trade (Mendes-da-Silva et al. 2008;Zheng et al. 2014).",

As indicated by Colombo et al. (2015), social capital is important to raising money. Thus, we investigate whether the origin of the actors that promote this social capital matters. At this point, we divide the social capital into two types: (1) external social capital, which is derived from social relations outside of the crowdfunding community, such as friends, family or intense fans; (2) internal social capital, involving those relationships that are established within the crowdfunding community, usually composed by donors and fans and enthusiasts with weaker relationships with entrepreneurs. Colombo et al. (2015) showed that the internal social capital significantly affects the number and value of donations in the early stages. These actors belong primarily to the internal network community, and they tend to have faster access to new campaigns in crowdfunding platforms, which increases the chance of them donating in a project's early stages. In the case of external social capital, which is designed by the friends, family and intense fans of the proponents, these contacts are commonly not connected to crowdfunding platforms. Thus, it is expected that the investors who are not socially connected to the entrepreneurs tend to take longer amounts to donate than others. Nevertheless, donors with close ties to the musicians tend to donate larger amounts (Saxton and Wang 2014). Given the above reasons, we believe that the greater the exposure time of the project is, the greater the value of the donations will be. This line of thinking leads to testing hypothesis H 2 :",

The use of these techniques in the business field is in an embryonic stage (Goodchild 2010), especially in studies of collaborative phenomena (Sui et al. 2013).

It is currently the largest collective financial community in the country and has already raised more than R$ 12 million to finance around 800 projects. The way it works is relatively simple and common to most competing sites: The entrepreneur uses the platform as a means to present their idea to the public, specifying the total investment required and the cutoff date for evaluating whether or not it has been achieved. To be able to use this platform for fundraising, the entrepreneur must meet the requirements given in Table 1. Figure 1 shows a typical project page on the platform we studied. On the right, observe: (1) the number of sponsors already attracted to the project, (2) the total pledged so far, (3) the total requested, (4) the remaining fundraising period, (5) the project description and (6) rewards and other relevant information. Table 2 shows a summary of the profiles of the ten projects selected for this study. Notice that these projects raised nearly R$ 200,522.00 from 1835 pledges that originated from 151 different municipalities. The second column of the table shows the project that received the greatest number of investment pledges (377 pledges) achieved its target (through the Catarse platform) of R$ 29,400. Project No. 1 originated from the city of Curitiba in Paran\u00e1 State, Southern Brazil. We do not highlight the pledge rewards because they were extremely similar and had the same pattern. These projects started with online distribution albums after physical distribution and evolved to give autographs and invitations to release shows. Note that Project No. 1 reached this total after 37 days of fundraising. Figure 2 shows the geographic distribution of the 377 pledges made to Project No. 1 via the Catarse platform, as given in Table 2.",

Fifth, we evaluated whether f One of the projects was resubmitted as a ''Second Chance,'' and it reached the funding target 101 days after the start of fundraising the influential observations and atypical cases (cases with standardized residuals [2.5) generated overestimations of the model. To this end, we tested the model after discarding cases where the residue was [2.5. The direction of the relationship between the variables and the significance remained the same. Sixth, we generated models by replacing the independent variables with their natural logarithms, and the results remained very close to the original model. Seventh, to see whether there was any significant influence of the projects on the relationship between the variables, we ran a model with nine dummy variables (n-1 projects) as a control. The results still remained close to what was found in the original model. Finally, because most of the donations occurred in the municipality in which the project was realized (56.3 %), there is a chance of having a selection bias. Fig. 2 Presentation of the geographic distribution of the pledges received by Project No. 1. Source: produced by the authors from data obtained from the Catarse platform using the tool ArcGIS ArcMap 10.0 (ESRI 2010). This figure shows the geographic distribution of donors pledging capital to Project No. 1, which attracted 396 pledges for a total of R$ 29,400. The most distant donor in Project No. 1, which is located in Curitiba/PR, was in the city of Manaus (Amazonas State); this donor corresponds to a distance of *2825 km. Country: Brazil Therefore, we also used the Heckman's Two-Step Selection Method (Heckman 1979). In the first step, we specified as the selection variable the donor-entrepreneur distance with a probit model, where the value one was assigned to all of the donations that came from distant cities (802 cases) and zero was assigned to the donations originated from the same city project (1.033 cases). At this step, we included the control variables as predictors. In the second step, we included the inverse Mills ratio variable in the OLS model, which controls the potential effect of selection bias, together with the independent and control variables. It should also be noted that because we observed no data from unsuccessful projects, it was not possible to assess empirically whether there was a selection bias in the projects. However, we believe that the relationship between the distance and the exposure time with respect to the value of donations is similar to corresponding relationship of successful projects. Table 4 shows the general characteristics of the set of projects included in this study. The full initial sample consisted of 1954 pledges to the ten projects. However, this figure included 119 anonymous pledges, which are allowed by the Catarse platform but do not provide information on the municipality from where the pledge was made. Thus, anonymous pledges were excluded, which left 1835 pledges that composed 94 % of the original sample.",

The projects attracted on average R$ 19,180.70, with total funds between R$ 10,000 and R$ 30,000, which is in accordance with the inclusion criteria adopted for this study. The average pledge was R$ 104.50, and the pledges varied from R$ 10.00 to R$ 5000.00. The average distance was 0 km, given that the majority of the sponsors (1033 of the total) were located in the same municipality as the project. The most distant sponsor was in Bonfim in Roraima (North of Brazil) for a project based in S\u00e3o Paulo (financial center of Brazil, in the Southeast), which represents a distance of 3297.7 km. In accordance with the study conducted by Agrawal et al. (2011) on the Sellaband site, the propensity of sponsors to invest increased as the funds raised by the entrepreneur increased. From Fig. 3, one can see that the distribution of pledges is very homogeneous during the typical project period (up to 60 days). However, a positive correlation between the project maturing and the value of the pledge made is evident; this correlation is observed mainly in the final fundraising phase (50-60 days), with the average pledge made growing by nearly 70 % in comparison with the period of 10-20 days (the period with the second-largest average pledge). The pledges after 60 days occurred when the projects were in a ''Second Chance'' phase, that is, they were more mature and still had the potential to reach the fundraising target if they were given the opportunity to review some of the problems encountered and make any necessary corrections. In this period, a drastic increase in the average pledge made can be greater than R$ 250.00, which again suggests the importance of project maturity on the sponsors' decision with regard to the value to be invested. This behavior supports the results obtained by Agrawal et al. (2011). However, we used OLS models, not models of binary response (such as Agrawal et al. 2011).",

However, in the study conducted by Agrawal et al.

Model I produced the results obtained for the two variables of interest: Days from the start of the fundraising period and Donor-entrepreneur distance. It can be confirmed from Model I that H 2 is supported, as Days from the start of the fundraising period gave a positive and significant parameter (b 1 ffi 1:193; p value \\0.01).

This financial innovation has enabled sources of funding for projects for a wide range of purposes, including cultural production projects, social projects and new technologies (Shiller 2013;Mollick 2014). Because it is supported by the internet, crowdfunding has the potential to make investment possible without the donors being close to the entrepreneurs. Even when dealing with small and medium investments in companies that are not listed on a stock exchange or in startups, it is only necessary for the entrepreneur to be able to provide relevant information to the donor, which reduces the information asymmetry, and therefore, the risks associated with the project. This fact increases the propensity of donors to pledge capital to the project.",

In line with the notion that networks of close contacts might play a central role in funding, and simultaneously contradicting the idea that crowdfunding reduces the inhibiting effect of the geographic distance between donors and entrepreneurs, the results point to a significant, negative effect of distance on the amount of capital pledged to projects. These results corroborate hypothesis H 1 , which stated that there is a negative association between the donor-entrepreneur distances and the values of pledges to music production projects financed by crowdfunding.",

In addition, they contradict the ideas proposed by Lee et al. (2008), for whom the internet performs a sufficiently expressive role to make the distance between the entrepreneur and donor insignificant in terms of the ability of entrepreneurs to receive pledges for their projects. The data showed that although the internet allows donations in a wider geographical range, this fact does not impact the values of donations. In addition, the results suggest that as the fundraising period progresses, the pledges to projects tend to increase in value; this pattern corroborates hypothesis H 2 , namely that there is a positive association between the time the project has spent on the platform and the value of the investment received by the entrepreneur. This result supports the arguments made by Zhang and Liu (2012) and by Kuppuswamy and Bayus (2014), for whom donors tend to have a greater propensity to invest in projects that they find hosted for a longer period of time on a crowdfunding platform.",

The issues investigated in this study add to the contemporary agenda for research into crowdfunding given by Lehner (2013), which appears to provide a promising field of business research. In addition, the results of this study suggest that crowdfunding requires new approaches that could help with the issues of attracting external capital, flexibility and financing costs, and asymmetric information on the part of donors. Accordingly, we encourage effort to be put into researching topics related to the development of the crowdfunding industry, e.g., (1) business and corporate governance models, (2) relationships with donors, (3) networks and the role performed by crowdfunding platforms, (4) discussions of the legitimacy of crowdfunding, (5) financial metrics, (6) legal and regulatory barriers and (7) recognition of opportunities.",
